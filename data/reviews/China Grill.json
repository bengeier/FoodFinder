{"text":"Oh boy was I pleasantly surprised by this delicious place. Always stop by Starbucks and this time I decided to try it and oh boy was I missing it! It is just simply delicious their egg drop soup is phenomenal their teriyaki chicken out of this world! Would decently recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix, hands down! :) I love you China Grill!  Service: 5 stars - awesome staff. This is family owned so go and support them! Panda Express has nothing on this.   Food: Twice Cooked Chicken is my favorite go to order here! They have awesome food and an extensive menu so there's always something new to try. The sushi rolls are delicious, too!  Environment: The restaurant is super laid back and it's fun to go out as a small group to really large groups. There is a full bar there which is awesome (and rare) for Chinese restaurants. Sake bombs go with any meal!! :) Oh, they also have TV and a large projector so you can watch all sports games.  Thank you, China Grill, for being the best Chinese restaurant in Peoria!  Fully Satisfied, Emily"}
{"text":"I would actually give 3.5 stars, but I will round up :)  Went here last night for another company dinner. I'm not a fan of Asian/Asianesque restaurants but this place was pretty good. Thank God we had a guy with us that LOVES LOVES LOVES this place, so we had him order most of the food.   Appetizers/Entrees: 1--Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings--a little too salty for me. It was ok, but nothing amazing.  2--Confucius Chicken Salad--SO GOOD. Fresh, light and a great mix of everything.  3--Pan Seared Spicy Tuna--I've been a fan of tuna lately. Tuna had good texture, but it was so small. A little overpriced, but good nonetheless 4--Miso Grilled Vegetables and Udon Noodles--great. the noodles were cooked perfectly  5--Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken--This was my least favorite dish, but it wasn't horrible by any means. I give it points for the chicken being savory and not dry at all, but the flavor just didn't do it for me.  6--Sweet Soy Marinated Skirt Steak--we had 2 orders of these. We ordered it Medium Rare. Good piece of meat, but not cooked like Stripsteak, which I had the night before!  7--Wasabi Mashed Potatoes--nice and soft. a definite departure from garlic mashed potatoes. Had a great kick to it.  8--Five Vegetable Fried Rice--Only had a spoonful of this, but I don't remember what it tastes like--so it must not be that special.   Dessert: Trio of Creme Brulee and The Great Wall -The Creme Brulee came in 3 flavors: Ginger, Chocolate, and Vanilla. Decent. Nothing special.  -The Great Wall looked gross, but when I dug into it, it was heaven in my mouth. I can't describe what it is--but it's good!  Drinks: We had a few bottles of wine. The chardonnay is a little too dry for me, but I managed to drink a glass. I also had a pear cocktail, which was sweet, and I couldn't taste much of the alcohol--which is a good thing.  Note: we asked for tap, and they tricked us and gave us bottled water. Beware. It's $10 a bottle. Rip off.  Our total bill was about $750 for 7 people...not the cheapest place in the world, but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Fried wontons was a 1 Star..i gave Orange Chicken  and braised tofu a 2 1/2 stars..service was ok. Over all it was m√©diocre food.."}
{"text":"This was our best dinner at Mandalay Bay. The veggie Udon noodles were delicious and satisfying, even though I had to move mountains of white crunchy toppings to get to them. The flavors were nice and the asparagus was cooked to absolute Perfection. The eggplant was about as bad as eggplant done wrong can get, but luckily there wasn't too much of it to pick around.  The tofu tots were also good, but the flavor was in the sauce, and the sauce looked suspiciously creamy. Everything of the sushi and fish variety that I did not eat got a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"friendly & helpful staff  excellent food & great presentation  pricy considering the types of ingredients that were used...  yummy complimentary chocolate-covered fortune cookies were a hit..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times because it's close to home and the food has been okay, but I was feeling under the weather last time I called to place an order and was wanting just the broth of the wanton soup.  When I asked for the price, the woman I spokewith told me $8, I asked her cancel the order (I'm not paying $8 for average broth) and SHE HUNG UP ON ME! Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Good food overall. Only complaint was the rice seemed frozen and not homemade. Service was good."}
{"text":"Took my husband to see Elton John for his birthday and after the concert we had reservations to China Grill.  Restaurant was recommended by a friend  and the majority of yelp viewers seem to enjoy it.  We were very disappointed.  Loved the fusion part; but, sadly the food overall was too rich and salty.  Had the tasting menu and yes you do get a lot of food after your first appetizer, but, definitely not quality with the exception of the first appetizer, which I believe, was a small crab ball.  We only got one each.  THREE SALADS - caesar, okay; but, covered in too much dressing - calamari, just okay - too salty - chicken, just okay, nothing special  SPICY BEEF DUMPLINGS - the beef wasn't the best quality and they were sitting in way too much soy sauce.  They also weren't that spicy.  I have had better dumplings, in general, from Trader Joe's.  LOBSTER PANCAKES - these were okay; but, then again too much sauce which drowns out whatever flavors you are suppose to taste and they were soggy  A HOT GLASS WITH CHAMPAGNE AND A BLOB OF STRAWBERRY SORBET - can't really remember what this tasted like but it wasn't anything special  SZECHUAN BEEF GARLIC WITH SHRIMP - this dish had pretty good flavor, but, again the overabundance of sauce that it sat in made the dish too rich.  The first few bites were good and then your taste buds realize it is too rich and you have trouble eating more of it.  CRISPY SPINACH - tasty but need to eat them hot or they get oily  FRIED RICE - bland  WASABI MASH POTATOES - Just okay, a bit too dry.  Needed more moisture.  CHOCOLATE CAKE - pretty good.  Not too sweet.  I know after reading this review, readers will think well she has a pretty plain pallate.  I assure you, I don't.  I can eat very spicy and rich food if it is done right.    With two drinks and 2 tasting menus plus gratuity we ended up paying over $200.00.  You can get a lot better for your money.  Trust me - don't waste your money.  If you want something similar and better go to PF Chang's.  They do a much better job of fusion and do not bombard the food with too much sauce and salt.    I only rated the food."}
{"text":"i love this place its a great place to eat late! the atmosphere is incredible and the food is amazing.. my favorite thing is the kobe beef tartar.. the service was great and they were quick as well.. i'll definitely do it all over again soon!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was very good food! Good service too. I had the twice cooked chicken with lo mein, and my husband had the sesame chicken with fried rice. He loved the egg drop soup (I didn't have any soup). We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The wife n I just checked into the Hotel n were craving Asian food.  We were dressed super casual despite everyone else dressed up for a club or funeral. No worries, the hosts and wait staff were excellent.  Although the prices for one of their \"Top Chef\" portioned dishes might set you back an hour's worth of wages ($22-$50), the taste was superb. We ordered short ribs, garlic shrimp, and vegetable fried rice. When our food was brought to our table I initially thought I could eat the entire thing as an appetizer..however, after splitting the entrees, my stomach was satisfied.  Just be advised that this place cost some bucks...but if you got a couple bills to invest in some fine dining, I suggest u give it a try."}
{"text":"7 friends and I went on a Saturday night for a late meal.  I rate this restaurant at a consistent 4 stars.  It's pricey, but hey, it's Vegas, and you certainly get what you pay for.  Our service was great and the food was savory and left us satisfied.  Overall:  4 stars food:  4 stars service:  4 stars ambiance:  4 stars  This was all of our first time to China Grill and our waiter was very helpful.  The restaurant is family style, which was great because we all got to try so many dishes.  We took our waiter's recommendation and ordered 4 appetizers and 5 entrees.  He doubled some of the appetizer orders so that we would have enough for us to share.  For me, that appetizers were the best part of the meal.  If I were to go back, I might just order lots of appetizers!  Appetizers Tempura Sashimi - the tempura was light and crispy Lobster Pancakes - 5 stars - pricey, but the best dish of the night Curried Chicken Satay - I think the weakest of the appetizers we tried Kobe Beef Tartar - excellent, 5 stars - the tartar was very tasty and smooth  Entrees Wild Mushroom Profusion Pasta - ehh, it's just pasta and mushrooms Curry Miso Butterfish - great sauce and flavor, but didn't notice any curry Duck Two Ways - just wished there was more! Char Siu Baby Back Pork Ribs - great flavor Moroccan Lamb Ossobuco"}
{"text":"This location is not up to the standards with the New York restaurant.  We brought our clients here and was terribly disappointed with the whole experience. The chicken satay  tasted like cheap, processed food with a lazy version of peanut curry sauce.  The  BBQ salmon was served with the skin on top with a bunch of glaze thrown all over to look like it was artistic but it just looked like an awful mess of a presentation.  The server delivered  half of our meals and made our party wait for about 15 minutes, which was awkward and also meant that after waiting 10 minutes, the food was getting cold so you had to start eating while your party  watched.   If you have an important meal, i.e. clients, celebration, engagement, choose another establishment until this location gets their act together."}
{"text":"I went with a group so the menu was preordered so I didn't get to choose. The dishes were hit or miss, the ones that were good were really tasty, the ones that were bad I can't even remember. The beef dumplings were incredibly tasty - usually they are just doughy globs.  The caesar salad, although an odd choice for a chinese restaurant, was good - I liked the addition of the wontons and cashews which gave it a nice crunch.  Obviously not traditional but a nice spin, as always too much dressing but...... There was a beef dish with asian slaw - the slaw was fried to make it crunchy which was nice accompanying the beef. The chicken dish was forgettable - really I don't remember except there were hunks of chicken.  The leeche martini was so over the top sweet and then the glass rimmed with sugar - I think I went into diabetic shock on this alone."}
{"text":"The portions do not match the price. We paid $4.50 for a Pepsi, and $15 for three 4\" chicken skewers.   The flavor of the drunken chicken was good, but the temperature was low. In fact, once I was done with the pre sliced chicken pieces, the leg was too cold to enjoy.  They switched the plates out after our appetizers only to take them away again for our entrees which didnt even come out at the same time.  The menus are made of a flimsy plastic and were impossible to keep open while reading.  We left, no alcohol, $80 in the hole, still hungry."}
{"text":"Been here twice on two separate trips and both times food and service have been amazing one of the best dining experiences, went for the $59 tasting menu well worth it. The ceiling was amazing with a projection that made it look as though the ceiling was rippling like water (pretty damn cool)"}
{"text":"I ate at Fleur de Lys and also Restaurant rm, but China Grill was my favorite!  Special was an amazing sea bass with risotto..the appetizers we enjoyed the most were the crab cakes and lobster pancakes.. Each bite more delicious than the last!"}
{"text":"Big fan if this place!  The food is served family style and there is always enough on 2 entrees for my family of 4. The service is outstanding, and Frank the bartender makes a heck of a cocktail!"}
{"text":"Really nice experience at China Grill tonight. My friend was in for a trade show at the Mandalay Bay convention center. I had planned to take her off property, but we learned China Grill has a happy hour menu - with the option to also order from the full menu in the comfortable lounge. We ordered a few happy hour special sushi rolls -- 4 piece rolls -- plus a terrific  spicy string bean side and the BBQ salmon entree to share. I'm not a fan of cream cheese in sushi rolls at all -- but the Philadephia Roll here is not to be missed. The full portion of the wild salmon entree seemed a bit pricey to me for what it was - but it was excellent. I'd highly recommend the happy hour. Nice menu -- food and cocktails--and plenty of healthy options, too, which was a nice surprise for me. I also like the atmosphere quite a bit."}
{"text":"Great service, great food were very accommodating to the children I was with they made sure food was on time and that we genuinely enjoyed it! Cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for take out. The staff is very friendly, clean environment and the lunch combos are good as well as reasonably priced. The portion sizes are not the normal large packed amount you get but perfect for lunch. Crab puffs were yummy!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Flavors were great in all the items I had."}
{"text":"I am normally a fan of China Grill.  I love their food and they have great service.  However, 2 days ago was the 1st time I have been back in 3 years because there are so many great restaurants in Vegas. The service was great as always, the food was consistently good.  I was not very hungry this time, so I didn't really get to enjoy the food the way I would have liked.    We ordered 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 side dishes for the 4 of us.  It was so much food, I thought I was going to burst!  I suggest to have the Server order for you.  It's easier and faster and they know what's good.  Lobster appetizer was good, noodles were good, cucumber salad w/the ahi tuna was good, so you can't go wrong.  Pricey, but I like it....  :)"}
{"text":"ya know.... NOT BAD.  did have a pre-determined thought about China Grill.... Thought... oh great.... another chinese place... have been burned before... many times before... however, determined to find a decent chinese place... so  let's try.........  The staff was great!  Food was Good!  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Once again, we find ourselves duped by the high reviews on Yelp on yet another Asian restaurant. We were on our way to Yu's Chinese Express but made a detour since a friend had mentioned this place, not to mention it had four stars on Yelp.  We go in, get seated, and after reading through the menu we are excited. Lots of traditional Chinese dishes, some of which we haven't had in a long time, so our hopes were high.  First thing we ordered was the hot and sour soup. A steal at $3.50 for a small portion, which was enough to feed 3-4. Unfortunately, it was neither hot (spicy) nor sour. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't live up to its name.  Besides the soup, we ordered the House Special Lo Mein, Sizzling Hot Plate Beef, Szechuan Green Beans, and Yui Shan Eggplant. We were expecting a feast, but was severely disappointed.  The Sizzling Hot Plate Beef arrived first. Interestingly enough, the beef was on a regular plate (not sizzling), which the waitress then dumped on to a hot plate (sizzled maybe just a bit). Then, she put a spoonful of what looked like rice wine over the dish, then attempted to set it on fire. That was a big FAIL, and then she tried to do it again, without success. We basically ended up with a non sizzling plate of beef that was drenched with rice wine. The Szechuan Green Beans were next, but it had a sweet taste to it. This was definitely another first...normally they are supposed to be salty and a bit spicy. The Yui Shan Eggplant was alright, which was probably the best part of the meal just above the white rice.  The kicker of course, was the House Special Lo Mein. When we ordered it the waitress made sure that we wanted crunchy noodles (cake noodle, or so we thought) and not soft noodles. We said yes, we want crunchy noodles. What we got was a plate of vegetables and meat with a side of fried won ton strips. Seriously? Normally I would've taken a few pictures, but I think I was in so much shock it didn't register in my head.   While the service wasn't bad (drinks refilled consistently) the food was blasphemous. Never again."}
{"text":"Love it. Went to the China Grill in Miami and those two visits were in my top ten dinners of all time. A visit here is also in the top 10.   Always creative and with good sized portions. Try the coconut ice cream for dessert. amazing what they can do with sugar! for dinner..eat ANYTHING. trust me. I think i've had the whole menu already. I really like their meats... the tenderloin with ? sauce was excellent. ask if they substitute it with rib eye? they did this once in miami (ran out of tenderloin) and it was even better! the one flaw..the drink size was really small for the price! i ordered a simple mango mojito (sp) and it came with about 4 oz of liquor. LOL needless to say, i only ordered one drink...i was afraid how small the next one would be. in vegas, best to order a beer..at least you know what you're going to get for the money ;)  also, the bathroom are incredible... BUT one question... how often do they clean that chain curtain going into and out of the bathroom??  many people don't wash their hands and EVERYONE HAS to touch that chain curtain to come in and out of the bathrooms... to avoid touching it... i used my shoulder! LOL i looked funny but i just couldn't see touching it on the way out!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG, can I just say \"Kobe Beef Tartare\"! Yum, that was really the best part of my meal.   The service was decent but the prices were a little steep. We had a large group and were able to try out a fair amount of the menu. This was everyone's first time, not sure if we will all be back though... maybe just for the Kobe Tartare!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with some friends, we were looking for a nice relaxing dinner.  We split two salads and the platinum sushi platter.  The sushi was very good and the salads hit the spot, we also weren't rushed which was nice.  We split two desserts, one of which was the sorbet medley.  The sorbet medley is gigantic and could be split by four people, highly recommended.  So why only 3 stars?  The service was atrocious.  The server was straight up rude and condescending to us, for no apparent reason.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but when I go out to a pricey restaurant, I prefer to not be talked down to."}
{"text":"Location is convenient. Food is good but not great. The service is spotty."}
{"text":"For a 'mid range' restaurant, it was really expensive - total tab for 2 came out to $120, which included a really bad bottle of white.  Oh well, I guess it is Vegas after all, where you can't expect to pay less than $50 per person for 'mediocre' food."}
{"text":"I love good Chinese food... and sadly, this place didn't deliver the two times I came here.  I just moved close to China Grill and I was excited to try out some new places around my house. The first time I went, it was for lunch and I dined in. I got the sweet and sour chicken, and the sauce just didn't do it for me. This time, I got the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special.. It came with rice..  In my opinion, it tasted bland and didn't even have a hint of spiciness to it..  After the first time, It was \"OK\" and I decided that I would give it another chance.. but, after today's lunch, I will not be going back and look elsewhere for a close Chinese food lunch spot."}
{"text":"This Iisus probably one of the WORST CHINESE I'd ever had their fried rice is white?? No flavor like eating boiled rice egg roll and teriyaki chix terrible Panda express is better want my money back only getting star cuz there is no half of star"}
{"text":"My sister and I spent our first day in Vegas walking down the entire strip, from our motel (up near Circus Circus) down to the famous Welcome sign.  We had plans for dinner, but all the walking we did was making us hungry (and thirsty!) for a little something.  We ducked inside Mandalay Bay to look around around and discovered an awesome happy hour going on at this place - $5 sushi rolls and cocktails!  We parked our tired bodies and feet in the seating area away from the bar (where we could still get the deal) and ordered two different cocktails and two rolls to share.  Everything was delicious and our server was really nice and attentive.  I definitely wish this place was still open so we could go back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Located in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the far end of the Las Vegas strip, China Inn is over-priced \"Chinese\" food.   The decor is very hip and has a twinge of Chinese flair. The bathrooms are kind of awesome. They have individual television screens in the pod like shaped rooms-- it almost feels like you are inside an ipod. But I digress, we're here for the food.   This restaurant is not a traditional Chinese restaurant-- and I get that. That said it is not designed for sharing with your friends and fam. I ordered the fried rice and man it was not tasty at all. I think I was blinded by the exotic ingredients like Japanese Citruses. While, I can appreciate the effort, the main dishes were not so good.   This restaurant's saving grace is the dessert menu-- I would only recommend you going there for dessert. The Creme Brule that I had was tropical flavored with passion fruit mixed in somewhere."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Chinese. Decor is good and the bright. Nothing to special mention.   Service is ok more towards cold.  Price is $$"}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok. The ambient was a little too dark for my liking. Usually like to see what I am eating. For a family type offering the quantity was small. This was more of a modern twist to Chinese cruisine. Some of their dishes was ok. Like the butter fish. Apparently the night that we were there they didn't have anyone that was experience with wine selection, so they had this waiter that didn't know anything about the wine."}
{"text":"the food here is okay but, it is hit or miss. just beware they charge a delivery fee without telling you, till they come to your door. really?!"}
{"text":"Simple, this place is much cleaner on the inside and out than your typical chinese fast food, even though the price is the same as those place. The food is well executed by a good chef, not drown in soy sauce like most other places. Most important of all is I didn't get stomached after my meal here.   Definitely come back to dine in and take out."}
{"text":"China Grill has amazing food. It is a fine dining experience. Expect small portions at a steep price.   Feel free to dress up, or dress down. This place is a cozy little hot spot with beautiful decor, and waiters!  The bathrooms are worth paying general admission to use. TVs and everything!!  I felt like a movie star when I was there. The service is superb and the food top-notch.   Recommendations: Appetizer- Lamb spare ribs  Dinner: Drunken chicken"}
{"text":"Ok...we are new to the area and are still trying to find our favorite restaurants.  We thought we would try this place based on other Yelp reviews.  The restaurant itself is ok, just as you would expect for a Chinese \"strip mall\" restaurant.  The food was comparable to getting Safeway Chinese food (so I thought...).  My husband and I were unable to finish our meals (large portions).  When we went to eat the leftovers the next night...my husband yells from the kitchen \"is it gross that I just found a rubber band in my left overs?\"  OMG!  Yes that is gross!  Are you kidding me??  How the heck did a rubber band get in our food?  And if there is a rubber band in there....I don't even want to know what else is in there.  SICK!  I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It is sooo...delicious and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good food!!"}
{"text":"Initially I thought this place was really good because I was ravenous when I came for a late night dinner here. However, now that I think about it, it was just alright. There's only so much you can expect from a Chinese fusion place and at least the waiters warned us that it wouldn't be authentic. Fun environment and good drinks. Just don't come here expecting a real Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Really great sizzling rice soup, mu shu and hunan chicken. And very friendly service."}
{"text":"Did not care about it... This place is dark, extremely dark. I understand what they are trying to do, but you can't read the menus, literally.  Food was hit and miss, more miss than hit. Way too much dressing/seasoning masking the actual taste of what you eat. They promote \"family style\" but quantity can not replace quality."}
{"text":"We stopped by for the sushi happy hour with a group of friends after visiting the aquarium around the corner. I was intrigued by the $5 sushi and drinks that was advertised. After taking a look at the menu only 2 out of the 5 happy hour rolls were actually $5. I didn't mind spending more to get a more interesting roll. However... when our rolls came out they weren't really rolls at all. Each roll no matter the price only had 4 pieces! You would be better off paying the $20 a roll to actually get some food. The sushi was good, but they limited it to two per ticket. There really wasn't enough food for what we spent. There are much better places for sushi on the strip. I would skip over this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by to give this place a try.  No wait.  It looked very nice and clean inside.  They have booths and tables with chairs for us big guys, plus the tables at the booths move so that's a plus.  I ordered the twice cooked chicken lunch special.  It came with egg fried rice, an egg roll, and soup.  I'm not a fan of egg fried rice so I tried to substitute it for pork fried rice but no luck.  They offered me the fried rice lunch special but I didn't want the fried rice to be the main entree.  They did, however, offer lo mein as a substitution for $1 more so that's the way I went.  I was surprised to have the choice of hot & sour soup instead of the customary egg drop soup, so I was pleased.  And now to the food; out first was the soup.  Not only was it hot temperature-wise, but also in spiciness.  This is by far the spiciest hot & sour soup I have ever eaten!  My nose was running when I was done with it, but it was a nice change to some of the bland h&s soups I've had in the past.  The twice cooked chicken was absolutely delectable and crunchy.  I guess that's a reason for eating there versus takeout.  I liken it to the house chicken you see in the majority of chinese food restaurants.  The egg roll was nice and crunchy, but not greasy.  The lo mein was good despite not having any meat in it.  Overall a very good meal with excellent service.  I would be a regular customer but I don't live or work near this restaurant but will stop by when in the area.  They have some competition from Yu's Chinese Express just south of Thunderbird on 75th Ave who have delicious house chicken themselves."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:  I still love the potstickers & soup & honey crispy chicken BUT the chow mein has changed. not good really anymore in my opinion. HOWEVER Sesame chicken & twice cooked chicken make up for it. Also if you go online to order there are two coupons for either 4 free crab  puffs or 2 free egg rolls. Service is always awesome & when you walk in the door & see the to go menu grab one the coupons are in that too.  I didnt take away a star because to me it still rocks.             Can I just say that not only do I love their hot & sour soup but the potstickers (which I order a side of vinegar for) are great & the honey crispy chicken is great too. We do sub chow mein for rice its a dollar more but worth it. The people there know my family & we will continue to go there."}
{"text":"I can sum up my China Grill experience in two words:  \"Yum! Yum!\"  China Grill is a beautiful, elegant restaurant with an incredible menu.  We took the advice of our waiter and ordered several different items in the \"half-order\" size.  (Most all items come as a half-order or a full-order).    This was an excellent suggestion as the two of us were able to taste a number of different items.  We started with the Curry Chicken Satay and the Beef and Scallion Dumplings.  Delicious!  We then had the Cracklin Calamari Salad.  Probably the best calamari dish we've ever had.  Our main course consisted of Grilled Garlic Shrimp (incredible!), Glazed Skirt Steak (Tasty!), and the Crispy Spinach.  The Crispy Spinach was unlike anything I've ever had.  It was good, but I'm not sure I need to try it again.  We had the trio of creme brulee for desert which included chocolate, vanilla, and ginger (yes ginger!) creme brulee.  They were all very good especially the ginger. (If you like ginger, you have to have this one!)  We also recommend the ginger mojito (unless you don't like ginger) and the Lychee Lemondrop Martini."}
{"text":"Visited with a friend and was quite pleased so I took another friend. I recommend the dish I enjoyed the first visit. My chicken entree was quite good however hers was TOUGH like RUBBER. Our waitress went to the owner who then came to our table to tell us she had checked with the kitchen and was told that it was the same chicken. WHO does that?!!!! I was stunned and stated that I could hardly believe her response, she proceeded to argue. She did remove the charge for the BAD entree. Decide for yourself if this is the way you want to be treated."}
{"text":"Yet again this is one of the best eats in vegas! We had the tasting menu again which was again fab but was only 59 bucks this time. The service is still the reason to go here x"}
{"text":"Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy  ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!"}
{"text":"Sizzling rice soup is great.  Never disappointed - fast and reasonable !  Nice seating in back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant to do their 5-7 pm Happy hour because as per advertised, they have drink and sushi specials. I've been to some really decent sushi places where serving sizes are pretty good. But China Grill's serving sizes don't really stack up to their high prices. We originally ordered just the Dragon and Ynagi rolls which we thought would be enough for us to atleast finish our first serving of cocktails. When we got the order, we were so disappointed on how small the rolls were and each serving was just 4 tiny pieces (imagine the typical roll sizes cut in half). We ordered some more rolls with the same disappointment and ended up paying $70.00 for 5 order of tiny rolls, 2 beers  ($7.00 each and 1 lychee lemon drop ($10.00) (which was, by the way, really good). We left that place feeling ripped off. If you're looking for good Japanese food inside Mandalay Bay, you might as well just go to Mizuya which is a real Japanese restaurant. China Grill should just change their name to Asian Grill since they are not really focused into serving Chinese food."}
{"text":"We ended up here because we had a large group and didn't have a lot of time for dinner, but surprisingly the food was pretty good, especially the calamari salad and the grilled salmon.  I guess these days every hotel in Vegas has to have a trendy Asian fusion place with groovy bathrooms.  The ones here are like really upscale porta-potties or large airplane bathrooms with high ceilings, with tiny little LCDs playing music videos.  Tao is more fun and has a cooler atmosphere, but I think I liked the food better here."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were so delicious here, much better than PF Changs. We came here in a party of eight for my bachelorette party and they were wonderful about accomodating dietary requests. Everything we ordered tasted great. Service was excellent. The bathrooms are a little weird...but it's all part of the Vegas experience, I guess."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they were located near Metro Center in 1988.  Always good service and great food.  Chinese food can sometimes be very oily and the food never is.  The owners recognize us and we always feel welcomed.  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is one of the best Chinese food restaurants in Peoria I've been coming here for a few years the food is always good and the employees that work here Know Who You Are and if you don't come for a month or two they give you all kinds of crap for not being around which means that they care that you come my favorite thing is the seafood noodle soup extra spicy. It has shrimp scalps mussels veggies  and the broth is so good  too bad it wasn't cooler outside or I would have got that today so I got my second favorite thing is there Mongolian beef I like it because it's on the sweet side with a little bit of spice I've never had it like this anywhere else it's wonderful and they're mixing drinks are pretty good too pina colada is really good they take their time to make you happy and give you the best service and pretty good food"}
{"text":"Just wasn't up to my expectations. My shrimp fried rice wasn't white and had no eggs in it. My orange chicken wasn't spicy and chicken had mediocre flavor. My general chicken was equally disappointing . I sat down to order to look over the menu and after five minutes the hostess sits by me prompting me to order quicker. Even after my food was brought to me I asked for a hot mustard. He looks at me grabs the bag pulls out the one mustard in the bag, and ask do I need more with a certain amount of contention . Overall I have given up on Arizona Chinese food and it looks like Panda Express or bust should be the monicker ."}
{"text":"We have had several meals hear and enjoyed all of them.  We finally had the opportunity to go in and eat, the restaurant is quaint and could use some updating.  However this is overshadowed by a tremendous staff and ownership.  They are very warm and inviting people, treating you as part of the family other than just patrons.  Just ask and they will make recommendations and speak honestly of their menu.  I guess I didn't want to give this the full five stars just based on restaurants appearance, but the food was fantastic and I have already spoke of the employees and ownership.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! Best Chinese food EVER. Started with the Sizzling Rice Soup, delicious with lots of fresh veggies! Edemame appetizer, huge bowl! Crunchy Honey Chicken was perfect. Chicken Chow Main with Crunchy noodles really tasty! Mariners Fans alert,  pitcher goes in twice weekly during spring training!! Enjoy. This restaurant is in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place I probably order several times a month and the food Is always delicious and the staff is great. Delivery usually takes about 45 min but it's totally worth the wait. The Szechuan green beans are so good. Have also tried the twice cooked chicken and honey chicken. All of it was excellent. Highly recommend trying this place out. A tip if you order delivery ask for the sauce on the side for items that have breaded chicken keeps it from getting mushy and makes a huge difference. This place never disappoints"}
{"text":"They've gotten a lot better with service. Food is always right and delivered quickly and always delicious! We've tried the other places and keep coming back to China Grill, they are the best."}
{"text":"China Grill is a very run of the mill 'Westernized' Chinese restaurant. It is similar in to Chine Toque which is located down the street, but I feel that China Grill has better food.   With all the great Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto area (which seem to be spreading westward) I think that there are many better options relatively near by. However, if you work in the neighbourhood and are pressed for time I would certainly recommend China Grill over Chine Toque."}
{"text":"Have been here on three different occasions and the service has always been great. The food on the other hand is to be desired. When ordering a side of fried rice instead of white rice they give you with most meals they skimp out on the egg and vegetables that should be mixed into the fried rice. I asked why they only mix such a small amount of vegetables and egg. Keep in mind they charge you a dollar more if you order the fried rice. I have no problem paying the dollar or even a dollar fifty. The waiter told me they only provide more egg and vegetables for the meals like chicken fried rice or pork fried rice and so on. The waiter advised he could add more egg and vegetables if I wanted to pay more. I mentioned that I was already paying more for the fried rice and if they wanted to offer fried rice as an option they should make it the way a person is familiar with.  I told the waiter that I would just like to have the sesame chicken only with no rice at all because it's not right to charge extra for fried rice when it has such a tiny serving of the remaining ingredients. It makes me wonder how many other things they cheat you on while charging you more for it. Keep in mind the waiter was doing an outstanding job the entire time because he understood the issue. He returned and said the manager would allow for us to have the fried rice served as it should be for the additional cost of one dollar. I agreed and received a true serving of fried rice. The meal for two people was in the neighborhood of 30.00 with 1 ice tea and a water. We tipped well for the service and our bellies were full. I can't say I will go there again but I can't say I won't because the service was good. They had an A rating on the door for the cleanliness of the place for two years."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on a date night, went to the shark reef, and then decided to check this place out since we in the area.   It was pretty dead, so service was really fast. We started off with the Spiced Crispy Pork Belly. It was delicious, the avocado mix was some of the best stuff I've ever had. I thought we were for sure on the roll of a great sushi dinner. We decided for our main course, to split the 4 roll tasting course which was $55. It was basically 4 rolls, each with 4 pieces. There was one with beef, which I was leery about, but it ended up being delicious. The other 2 were so-so. The 4th one though, was a lobster roll. I love lobster, but I like lobster with some melted butter and a baked potato, not in my sushi roll. I give this place only 3 stars, because the sushi part of it, wasn't so great. If I ever go back, I'd like to try their actual dinner menu, since the pork belly was delicious, there might be some gems in there."}
{"text":"First off, this restaurant isn't bad. The service we got was excellent. The food quality to me though is a little worse than expected. i feel that the chef didn't let the food speak for itself and just was a little heavy on the sauces. We did the little bit of everything on the menu family style. We started with a raw tuna atop of a potato chip and zucchini. It was interesting - the flavors didn't clash, but I didn't find anything from it that particularly stood out. It was okay. The salads - one of them was chicken, one was just some sort of veggie and another was calamari. I felt the chicken tasted too much like sesame oil and the veggie one just tasted too much like soy sauce. I didn't really taste too much else. Beef dumplings were quite good. They were unique and tasty. The fried spinach was interesting - they were almost like spinach chips. Wasabi mashed potatoes? I think I've had those before elsewhere, but I'm just not into the flavor. The fried rice was quite good. I think it tasted like fried rice you can get at a lot of places, but it wasn't overly seasoned. There was a garlic shrimp dish with a fettuccine - it was quite good. I'm not that into pastas as they are a bit too buttery for me. I think this was the case here, but it's not any worse than going to a nice Italian restaurant and getting pasta. The dessert was good - a cream cheese potsticker. I thought it was excellent - I expected much worse considering what the potsticker skins taste like. I don't think I'll go back again, especially if it's on my own dime. I wouldn't rate this place any better than PF Chang's. The service however, was excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely not Chinese food, or even asian really.. but still enjoyable.  The restaurant was beautiful and the service was flawless.  This is a family style restaurant, so keep that in mind before you go.  We had the shortribs appetizer which was pretty good, but every time Ive had shortribs (all over)  I cant help but think of my mother's, which have yet to be topped.  I look forward to this fad being over.  We had the Duck Two Ways for our entree.  I thought it was delicious.  Cocktails were all delicious and they have quite a few strong ones to choose from."}
{"text":"Spent some time in the bar for an evening treat.  Tasty rolls - volcano, spicy tuna, the usual fare.  Staff friendly and attentive.    Good to visit during happy hour, when appetizers are 'half off' so as not to break the bank.  We're yokels - took turns visiting the fun bathroom stalls - checking out which video was playing where... even took pictures!  more to come... fun place for a fun time with colleagues or friends!"}
{"text":"very beautiful expensive they do have a happy hour. The portions are smaller to compensate for the lower price. We will still ok with that. Next to the Mandalay Bay Hotel Convention Center where we were attending an event, so the convenience factor was super high we got a pair of rolls that were $5 each at happy hour consisting of 4 pieces each... and a plate of edamame for $5..."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from someone and decided to try it despite some iffy reviews. I love Chinese food. So I was incredibly disappointed when this food was so unappealing. The rice has no flavor. The sauces are just sugar, no other flavor covering  flavorless chicken. The prices are not worth that disappointment and I really don't mind paying for food."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and have had a hard time finding a great place since Far East closed! China Grill is delicious! The portion sizes are large....you get your moneys worth that is for sure! Not only do you get large portions, the quality is above the rest. I highly recommend the China Grill!!"}
{"text":"This should be obvious to everyone. It should have been obvious to me. But please don't order anything other than the Chinese dishes. Don't order sushi! Don't get a steak! You'll be really, really disappointed.  Despite my long-standing strategy of going with a restaurant's strengths when I order, I decided to get sushi one time. I knew better. I really did. But damn, sushi sounded good. As it so happened, my friend didn't want Chinese, so she ordered a steak.  The sushi was so icky. The ahi tuna was BROWN. I could barely choke any of it down, and ended up leaving most of it. My friend's steak was thin, tough, and cooked to oblivion.  My GF was smart and ordered the lunch special, and was happy as a clam. Thankfully, she shared.  I would deduct a star, but, since that time, I've gone back a few more times and \"went with their strengths.\" Those trips reinvigorated my enthusiasm for China Grill.  Oh and I found I actually am within their delivery zone. We have ordered from them a few times, and it's always good, but not as good as when you dine in."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here almost every time we are here (except this trip, when we stayed at Encore and stayed on this end of the strip), and we love the meal every time. The service is quick and reliable, as is the food. One time we had our usual lamb spareribs, unusual & delicious, and they were a bit on the fatty side; the next time we went we mentioned this to the waiter, who proceeded to bring us the perfect plate of unfatty spareribs. We also love the duck salad with crunchy noodles and a citrus dressing. I am not a big fan of eating Daffy, but this salad is fantastic.   Except for the occasional special, which may take you by surprise (e.g., we ordered a lobster special that was a bit more than we'd expected, but, hey, it was lobster, so we knew it wouldn't be cheap), the other thing we like about China Grill is that we always get out for under $100, which, for a good restaurant in Vegas that isn't a buffet, feels like a bargain. There is a reason why we always go back!"}
{"text":"The food is really, really good. I have not had anything yet that I do not like. What gives this place the 5 starts is the customer service.   They are some of the nicest people I have ever encountered.   The Westside is so full of chains. It is so nice to find this little gem."}
{"text":"I can't believe we never tried this place for all the times we've been to vegas! It is soooo good! I think we had the same server as L.M., because our server looks like Prince Harry too! Just a bit thinner and taller, not that I've seen PH in real life, ha. Anyways, PH was very friendly and non pushy. He told us just order 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and 2 sides, should be enough for the 6 of us. So we ordered the lobster pancake, 2 orders crabcake with pineapple tomatillo, duck two ways, and braise beef ribs w/ mashed wasabi potatoes, duck fried rice and veggie fried rice. The lobster pancake was absolutely worth every penny of the $32. we can see large chunks of lobsters, it came wrapped in a crepe lookalike. The crabcake was perfect, I never had crabcakes that are a bit panfried crunchy before, and there was no filler used , so the only thing you can see is the pure whiteness of the meat. Perfect. ($28 for 3) Duck two ways - half the duck is cooked on a skewer with chocolate sauce on top, theother is served in  a bowl , cooked in a soy sauce dressing with lots of veggies ($39). Although the choc. sauce was good, I rather have the duck plain , it was already very flavorful. The other half in soy sauce was quite salty, maybe that's why it came with some crepe lookalike again, to offset the saltiness. The beef ribs was fantastic ($38), meat so soft you don't have to chew, the mashed potatoes was a hit at the table, and the portion was big. I was really hoping to see what they have to offer for dessert, but we were all just too stuffed to even look at the menu. A couple next table ordered the $99 lobster for two cooked shanghai way, the platter was about 2 1/2 dinner plate big. Next time I shall conquer that."}
{"text":"Just saw the lady transport at China Grill transport veggies in her light blue Honda CRV.  She took a tray of half cooked noodles out of her trunk with no covers!  I was shocked!  She put it on a cart and kicked it back into place with her dirty shoe going up the ramp.  So much sanitary issues going on with this place."}
{"text":"I met up with some out-of-town friends at Mandalay and we were deciding on where to eat. Noticed the happy hour sign at China Grill and $5 sushi. I'm in!  Like a previous reviewer, only two rolls were $5, California and Spicey Tuna. AND you only get 4 pieces per \"roll\"..so basically each piece of sushi is $1.25. Little steep in my book...they should call it \"sad and still hungry hour\"  :(  I ordered the Philly Roll ($6.50) and Spicey Tuna ($5.00), ate those in 2 minutes and left.   I always wanted to stop by here because the decor is so awesome, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there for NYE.  Service was very good and the food was great. Make sure to order the callimari salad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very quick delivery. I Reccomend the Mongolian beef on white rice with no crunchy noodles. I eat here 3 times a week and prices aren't bad at all."}
{"text":"China Grill was great for happy hour, but I can imagine it is somewhere I would like late night.  It's dark and sexy, with plenty of room to lounge, great drinks, and a Thievery Corporation-based playlist.  I really, really want a place like this in DC.  I will never, ever get it.  But onto food and drinks: whatever I drank was strong.  And tasty.  I had three of them and I was way more than tipsy.  Kelly enjoyed her appetizers, but I don't like anything on the appetizer list.  I tried ordering an option from it, and was just not a fan.  However, go for the atmosphere and the drinks."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY delicious rolls!  I recently stayed at Mandalay Bay and this is one of the restaurants located in this hotel. Beautiful decor, very trendy and modern. I definitely couldn't tell I was in a sushi place. The service was alright, but it was really the food that was over the top. I ordered the Volcano Roll and the Red Dragon roll. The presentation of the food is gorgeous, more like art. Not to mention yummy!  The strange thing about this place was the bathrooms. Why I pay close attention to bathrooms in places I'll never know. But this place had the stalls set up like separate pods, alien like. And they're individual stalls with TVs playing music videos, etc. It was very oddly set up. None the less it was very nice, but just very odd."}
{"text":"This one was a bit of an enigma. They purport to feature plate-sharing as the main focus of their menu however the portions are extremely small so I'm not sure how you're supposed to share something that is barely enough for one person. For example, we ordered the spicy beef and scallion dumplings: out came 4 and they were tiny. OK, fine. Next? Chicken satay skewers: 5 of them. 5? Really? There's two of us, why 5? Our entree was the Seared tuna and again... 5 slices. Are you trying to start a fight between me and my GF? The thing that saved this meal was that we ordered a side of Duck fried rice and out comes a huuuuge bowl of rice with large chunks of duck in it. Nice.  That, and everything was actually really tasty. However, the uneven portions and spotty service don't propel this place any further than a glorified Chinese diner. It did help that the dining room was set back a bit further and sunken in from the main corridor, which at least transported you for a brief moment outside of the casino interior."}
{"text":"Small expensive portions. Had the shrimp with black fettuccine. Shrimp were ginormous and outstanding. They came with this extremely light topping which was paper thin that moved in the breeze and looked alive - very trippy. The pasta wasn't that tasty but interesting to look at - I'd never even heard of black fettuccine before.  I'd give it 4 stars but my waiter was pushy and tried a couple times to get me to order more than I wanted."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced (grain of salt - it's Vegas).  My rundown of the dishes, which were somewhat uneven:  -Chicken salad was pretty good, but unexciting. -Soy glazed steak was tasty, and the tempura shitakes accompanying it were very good. -Barbecued salmon was a disappointment - it was way overcooked and dry.  There are many better restaurants for the price in Vegas, where the service measures up (it felt amateurish). And really, if you're looking for Asian Fusion, head to Tao in the Venetian - better food and cooler vibe."}
{"text":"There seems to be a wide variety in people's experiences at this restaurant. I'm not sure why this is the case --  but, I haven't been disappointed a single time. I have been there in the past several months with parties that ranged from two to 12, and the food has been very good, the service prompt, and the atmosphere welcoming. It remains on my list of favorite places to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"The menu is very odd, kind of chinese but not really.  I had the dumplings for appetizer which were fine and the chinese short ribs for dinner which were disappointing, not nearly as tender as I had hoped.  I did enjoy the goat cheese mashed potatoes.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Owner is very engaging. Staff is very nice and professional. Food is pretty good but a little inconsistent overall."}
{"text":"We always order from here because the food is consistently good. We've tried many things on their menu and have yet to be disappointed. They are pretty quick on delivery time and the delivery person is always friendly. One of our go-to's when we need a break from cooking."}
{"text":"Nothing special and way over-priced.  There was nothing wrong with China Grill but there was nothing right about it either. For the quality of food, I found it quite over-priced. For example, we have a quite small pepper-encrusted ahi plate for $42. The night before we ate at Delmonico and for the exact same price I had three times the fish and more importantly, it was significantly better.  The service was pretty poor at China Grill also. We got there right when in open and despite only have four tables seated and at least three waiters plus busboys, the service was annoyingly slow."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour from 4-7pm.  $5 drinks and appetizers.  The ginger mojito was amazing - big chunks of fresh ginger.  So yummy, but you must love ginger. The happy hour sushi rolls were also quite good.  I'm usually not a fan of Philadelphia rolls but this one came with pesto, which was excellent.  The rolls were half rolls but they were only $5.  I think they must have lowered their HH prices since Robyn visited in April.  The \"pod\" restrooms were interesting - check them out.  I think they were installed by a previous restaurant.  Mine was a little messy but the design of these single stall restrooms was interesting.  And there were a lot of them.  Nothing is worse than a huge restaurant with one single stall restroom.  Definitely a good choice for happy hour in Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last weekend. Food wasn't bad, but wasn't OMG good. My sesame chicken had no flavor and my husband's mongolian beef was mostly crunchy noodles. The \"free\" 2 egg rolls were half the size of egg rolls we get else where. I ordered online to have it delivered at 6:15 pm. They showed up at 5:45 pm. What if I was still in traffic? They were lucky I was home!! I am not impressed"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I went with another couple on Christmas Day and we were all very pleasantly surprised.  There was zero wait, the prices are extremely reasonable and you get a lot of food for your money.  Good service even though they did have a little mix-up on my order.... the other three meals came out on time but there was a mistake on mine so I had to wait a little longer.  Not a huge deal and I only had to wait about 5 minutes before mine came out.  Atmosphere is so-so ..... very casual. Two of us had the honey crispy chicken (very yummy), my bf had the General Tso's chicken, and the last had teriyaki chicken.  We were all very pleased."}
{"text":"The food wasn't \"that bad\".  The menu was beat up and tacky.  It smelled of an old dirty wet rag.  I ordered the \"tofu tots\" and \"skirt steak salad\".  The tots tasted like mushy potato tots, but costs a lot more than potatoes.  The skirt steak was hard to chew.  I had to swallow large pieces, and gave up half way through my steak.  The bartenders were very nice and friendly.  I hear the owners of china grill, rum jungle, and Red,White, and Blue were sold.  So China Grill will be closing down in November for good.  Construction is planned for 4 months.  The new restaurant will be sushi oriented. I can't wait to try it on my next visit."}
{"text":"Have been to this place quite a few times and have been pleased each time. Just recently I went in for a take out order and both the man who took my order and a woman (who I assume might be the manager or owner) were very friendly and the service was extremely fast.  By far the best service I've had in a while.  Little tip - always look on the website for coupons"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the tasting menu with seasonal wine pairing. It was excellent!! More than generous portions and fresh, fresh, fresh.The service is friendly without being overbearing. Not cheap, but outstanding in every way."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite chinese place.  My partner and I were driving around, waiting to meet up with friends to go to the Peoria Art Exhibition and just happened to see this place and stopped in to have lunch.  My experience with chinese food is that the food has a lot of potential and most places just don't put the effort into that potential which makes the dish into a slimy bland piece of blah.  So, going into this little shop, I had my reservations, but I'll eat just about anything as long as it is classified \"human food\", even if it might taste bad.  I was HIGHLY surprised.    Started off with some egg drop soup... excellent.  That one tends to be slimy and texturally yucky in most places I've been to, but this one was done pretty well.  I got the Mixed Veggies in white wine sauce with Shrimp and Scallops lunch special.  It comes with fried rice and a little lettuce salad that has a ginger vinagrette dressing on it.    And it was SO GOOD.  I was totally expecting the bland blah that I usually get, but this actually had taste! (like that Campbells soup commercial... that's the taste of TASTE. lol)  The waitress was nice... it was cold when we walked in and they fixed the air.  The front of the store is more tables, the rear around the corner is booths.  I definitely recommend.  When I'm in the mood for chinese, this is the place I'll be going."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food!!!  Very clean restaurant, awesome staff, and amazing food.  We had dumplings, house fried rice, sizzling rice soup, wonton soup, and chicken teriyaki.  Food was fresh, hot, and tasted super good.  My son and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"China Grill was one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!!!!  The waitress was really nice, the food was unbelievable and the drinks were tasty!    Ordered the duck two ways, lobster mashed potatoes and lychee martini...OMG...flavor explosion in my mouth.  AMAZING!  I will be back every time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food is alright. Ordered the Mongolian pork and it tasted a little to sweet. No spicy at all like the menu said. The food tastes like they add to much corn starch! Portions are small as well during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Long live China Gate! If there was a mecca of Chinese food for me in Arizona, it was China Gate which was torn down in the construction of Metro Center to make way for a Petsmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Subway, Blockbuster, and Starbucks. No joke.  It was finally resurrected in a strip mall (by another Starbucks) on the west side with a shorter menu and much better atmosphere then ever before. It is located in this satellite piece of the strip mall right at the corner of the intersection.   It is still a nice place to eat even though its in a strip mall because of some great interior design. Although the floorplan of the place is a little awkward with a bar area and dinning room with a big tv when you walk in and another dining area down the hall. They have the equipment to do karaoke in the front section on the tv, but I don't know if they ever actually do it unless you have a party there.  But the food is the best part. It is on the Americanized side but you are eating Chinese food in Phoenix, AZ. It's hard for me to get anything other then the Mongolian there which is incredible. Most people get it with Pork, but it is also awesome with their deep-fried tofu. They also have awesome spring rolls, but they aren't quite as good as they were when they were China Gate.  They have lunch specials still but they aren't as mind-boggling as they were at China Gate. At china gate, you got a full dinner plate, fried rice, soup, and an egg roll for 5.50. Now you get a slightly smaller sized main dish, rice, soup, a tiny salad with sesame dressing, and some wonton action for like 6.75.   But still overall, its one of the few great independent places on the west side along with Mike's Rigatoni Bistro and Touch of Thai."}
{"text":"While their food is nothing to write home about, their bathrooms should draw a crowd.  If you get a chance, sneak into this place for their bathrooms!  They're pods!!!  White, tv filled pods!  Their food is overpriced, but the place is beautiful (not worth it still).  Their desserts are good so stop by for a citrus creme brule and a quick pit stop.  There's a bathroom attendent (points you to a bathroom while sitting down)."}
{"text":"The China Grill at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas is not a Chinese food restaurant.  As it was explained adamantly by my waiter , it is a global fusion that brings together the flavors of Japan, Thailand, Chinese and American cuisine ( I guess that meant no Pu-Pu platter for two). With our no Chinese food explanation at the fore front of our minds Simone and I set upon the task of looking over the not so Chinese menu.  All items on the menu are meant to be eaten family style and shared -much like in China (oops). At the suggestion of our waiter we started our fusion journey with the not Chinese Beef and Scallion Dumplings. The dumplings were soft and pillow like, filled with minced tender beef and chopped scallions and served with a micro green salad on top and of a pool of spicy sauce. Alone, they were bland but eating them in a 5 alarm pool of soy, ginger chili sauce took care of that problem nicely. After downing an entire glass of water to ease the fiery pain , we then decided to choose our entree.  Our entree choice was the not Japanese Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken, served with a sweet Hoison laced Ponzu sauce and Bok Choy slaw with crispy onions, and for our side a not Chinese Duck Fried Rice.  The chicken arrived whole, but already cut for our convenience. It was excellent,  the sweet Sake marinade combined with the natural juices of the chicken kept every bite moist and full of intense flavor. The slaw was crunchy and vinegary and was a nice compliment to the dish. The side of duck fried rice was good also. The rice was very lightly fried with sesame and soy but not overwhelming in salt or oil. The shredded duck was rather dry, but the overall flavor of the rice was very good. We finished the entire bird and rice and still had some room for Deep Fried Cheesecake for dessert. Cream Cheese filled fried wontons arrived with  a five spice chocolate dipping sauce, assorted fruit and Mango Raspberry puree. The chocolate was rich and spicy with ginger overtones, and the Mango puree was fresh and sweet.. Both were great with the wontons. Overall this was a very good but not great \"fusion\" meal at the Not so China Grill in Mandalay Bay. For the price you can probably find better in Las Vegas.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. This place is family style, so everything is made to be shared.  We had the Crackling Calamari Salad, the lime miso sauce went great with it. We also had their Grilled Szechuan Beef and Korean Kalbi Rib-eye. Both came out great and the potato sides that came with it were yummy too. A couple months before, I ordered the Pan Seared Spicy Tuna which also tasted great.  And for their sides we had duck fried rice, wok sauteed vegetables and wasabi mashed potatoes.  Everything that came out was cooked perfectly and very filling. The wait staff were great also.  Only complaint would be that their mix drinks weren't so good. =("}
{"text":"5 star atmosphere, 3 star food, 4 star drinking makes this a 4 star overall experience.  I went here with a large group of colleagues for dinner and drinks.  We ordered almost one of everything on the menu.  My favorite, by far, was the Drunken Chicken.  Everything else was so-so for my taste, although everyone else seemed to enjoy the food.  The bar area was nice, normal selection of top shelf liquors that one expects in Vegas, bartenders were quick and poured stiffly.  And after you pound down a few cocktails, head off to the bathroom for a real treat:  Some of the coolest bathrooms that I have ever seen.  I don't want to ruin the surprise, just go."}
{"text":"Over priced to say the very least. The service was super slow and the over lighting in the place was awful.  It was so dark in there I had to get my cell phone out to see my menu. I ordered Sake Marinated \"Drunken\" Chicken.  It was supposed to be garnished with saut√©ed onions instead I got a whole greasy chicken (with the skin still on) COVERED in onion rings. This dish was about $45.  Totally disgusting!!! I went with 3 other people and only 1 other person liked there dish.  I would rather eat McDonalds before going back there.    Oh and don't get trapped by there \"Happy Hour\" specials.  They may have 1-2 things worth while on the menu but the cocktails we not good at all."}
{"text":"Close to our home and had never tried!  Wow... great Chinese food and awesome service.  Friendly, family owned restaurant with an eye towards service and great food.  Pot stickers homemade and Mongolian Beef was great.  The menu is pretty diverse so can't wait to try some other options. Enjoyed the atmosphere and neighborhood feel.  Definitely will be back here again."}
{"text":"I've tried several chinese take outs around the west valley.  Most are very salty.  China Grill is by far the best!  The menu is great, I especially love the ma po tofu and combination fried rice.  The egg rolls are the best I've ever had!  Everything I've ordered is cooked to perfection!  I hope China Grill stays in business for many years."}
{"text":"We really like China Grill. We tried a few other local places that left menus on our door and they we're subpar compared to China grill. We've always gotten delivery and our order has always been correct and within the promised time. We love the crab puffs and also shrimp and veggies. They are our go to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Expensive and average were my takeaways on dinner at the China Grill.   The food was not as good as a CheeseCake Factory, and I would just skip this place"}
{"text":"If Leonardo (still can't be sure if he was the night manager or just a server extraordinaire) was the one who had greeted my man and me when we walked into this resto for a quick meal, I would have given this place 5 stars. It's because their hostess insisted that I wait for 10 minutes, after a scan of the dining area produced several vacant tables AND I explained that my man and I were trying to eat a quick dinner before concert at the Beach that this place gets 4 stars. Once Leonardo saw my disappointment, he quickly ushered me to a table and, voila -- service was BRILLIANT!   Food -- Fantastic. We ordered their crackling calamari salad and lobster pancakes, both of which are heavenly. We also ordered the Red Dragon Roll, which was delish, though I could have done without the soy paper, and sashimi-style Hamachi, which went down like butter.  Service -- A+ for Leonardo. He is fantastic. The table next to us (a table of 20 dudes who were ready for a night on the town) insisted on high-fiving him, with several \"You're the man,\" followed by fist-bumps thrown in for good measure. I agree. He got dinner out for us with a quickness so that we were able to eat at a leisurely pace and still make it to the Beach on time. Fabulous.   Yes, this place is not cheap. Dinner for the 2 of us (no drinks) cost just over $100 before tip. But, what do you expect from a sit-down place on the Strip which serves good quality food with solid ambiance? One tip if you're watching your pennies: ask for half orders, as opposed to full orders, for most things on this menu.  You'll still be able to enjoy the food but in smaller (but still generous) portions.  Yes, this place is also part of a successful chain of restos... and may not be as good as its equivalents for ambiance in Miami or New York. But, Vegas has one thing that the MIA and NYC doesn't have... you guessed it.....Leonardo!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good chinese restaurant. This one has a friendly, attentive staff. Tried the beef egg fu yung and it was quite good but the 3 patties were about half the size of any other chinese restaurant I've been to. Spouse's vegetable lo mein was tasteless. Still looking for a good chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Garlic pepper squid is spicy and amazing. General Tao is nothing special. Curries are great. Worth going and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Tasty Americanized Chinese food in a grand setting."}
{"text":"Order: chow mein - mushu pork - hot and sour soup - wanton soup  Chow mein - slimy, flavorless, and they used spaghetti noodles.  Mushu pork - tortillas instead of mushu pancakes, mostly filler vegetables, and they used plum sauce instead of oyster sauce.  Hot and sour soup - used canned Portobello mushrooms rather than black fungus, while the taste was close on this it was missing a bit of vinegar.  Wanton soup - they used what looked like frozen mixed vegetables for the wantons rather than fresh vegetables. Again, flavorless.  Overall: fast service, but extremely subpar food. Nothing was even close to authentic and few ingredients were actually fresh."}
{"text":"Really dark and seductive, like a good Vegas restaurant should be. I thought our servers recommendations were helpful. The full entrees are good for about 3-4 people, and the smaller portions for 1-2.  Four of us shared their Caesar Salad... which is really more of a cross between Chinese Chicken Salad with Caesar dressing, sounds gross but works well at this place. We also had the beef dumplings appetizer, which was a bit overpriced, and nothing special.  For the main entrees we had the garlic shrimp which was served over some Delicious fettuccine pasta and the short ribs which were flavorful.  Because you will be tempted to order a number of items to share, like most Vegas spots, the overall price will rise quickly.  This place works well for groups of 4-6 people. Its a good spot, and I think worth a look if you are staying at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Much like raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, sushi happy hours are one of my favorite things.  We saw sign for the sushi happy hour here, so stopped in with a group of friends after getting some drinks elsewhere.  I had a $5 seaweed salad and a $5 vegetable roll.  Both were decent - not spectacular, but I feel it was a good deal for $5.    As I can't remember what I had to drink, it is probably one of two things 1) the drink was unmemorable or 2) I had done too much day drinking before happy hour time to accurately remember.  Who knows!  The service was good, especially considering how packed the lounge area was with others partaking in the happy hour."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and great lunch prices. Service is great as well.  The male waiter is amazing he checked on us consistently. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"My date and I came in on a weekday so nobody was eating at the time. We were greeted by all the people that worked there with a smile and a welcome so that's awesome! The environment seemed appropriate with music and decorations. The menus were a bit faded on the back though. The servers were on track and always focused on the customers and their needs. We had a guy with a ponytail and he was awesome and funny, took the time to talk with us and recommended some items to eat! In terms of the food, we ordered crab puffs, veggie lo mein, and honey sesame chicken. The food was delicious while not bland nor over greased like other typical Chinese restaurants! They provided enough rice to balance out the meal which is normally a complaint of mine since most places don't give enough rice! I love rice since I'm Asian! Actually there was more rice than food in the end! The chicken was crispy and white, just right! The crab puffs were great too with a side of sweet and sour. But my favorite was the lo mein, it wasn't greasy and the taste was spot on. My date loves lo mein and she said it's one of the best she tasted! As for the drinks, they were never emptied since they had awesome staff! Will definitely be coming back for more! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This review is based on only the food we ordered to go. My family and I are looking for a new go to Chinese Restaurant. We ordered their Pu Pu Platter, Pork Mu Shu, Beef Fried Rice, Chow Mein, and Mangolian Beef. The Mu Shu Pork and egg rolls was the only thing I liked. My kids like the beef fried rice although we've had better else where.The Pu Pu Platter was a waste of money the only good thing was egg rolls and crab puffs so not worth the money. Mangolian Beef had zero flavor! So our mission continues to find some awesome Chinese food."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, this place was fantastic.  Hosted a business dinner here, and the wait staff was amazing.  Everything they recommended was amazing.  All seafood was great, but so were the non-seafood dishes.    Must have's: Ginger Creme Brulee.  Wow, that's all I could say.   Lobster Mash Potatoes - nuf said Grilled Garlic Shrim"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Chiense Cuisine, in fact Chiense food is one of my favorites. We might not have a Chinatown in this city, however, that doesn't mean we don't have delicious and authentic Chinese food in Arizona.  The entr√©e's at China Grill are absolutely delicious.¬† Without a doubt, one of the best meals that I¬† have had in a Chinese restaurant.¬† You won't find stodgy batter, or red dye stained food at China Grill, what you will find is fresh, tasty, made to order delicious meals.  On my first visit I went with the Honey chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup, and eggroll. The Honey Chicken was crispy, plump fresh white meat chicken, perfectly seasoned not drowned in sauce. The Honey chicken was probably some of the best honey chicken I have had. The eggroll were crispy, full of flavorful vegetables, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought out immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers.¬† a perfect meal, great service, and delicious food.  I'll be going back very soon."}
{"text":"China Grill was not disappointing at all! My party of 3 ordered the grilled wild salmon, calamari salad, and pad thai which was a special.  For dessert we ordered the Great Wall.  Grilled Wild Salmon: The salmon was SO amazing, so tender and flavorful.  The portion was just right, not too big and not too small.  Calamari Salad: Shockingly, I feel like this was my favorite dish.  To be honest, there wasn't a lot of calamari in the salad but the calamari was definitely flavorful and delicious.  The salad itself was fresh and definitely not soggy.  The most amazing part was the dressing, it absolutely blew me away.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to get ranch or italian dressing down again!  Pad Thai: The pad thai consisted of 50% noodles and 50% vegetables, which I didn't mind.  It also had pieces of steak in it, the steak wasn't fantastic but it was pretty good.  The overall taste was kinda sweet, and I felt like it was good but not enough to rave about it.  Great Wall: Wow! The dessert was just SO spectacular, the great wall is basically a huge block of different layered ice cream with a crumbly chocolatey bottom.  The block is covered with melted, slightly crispy on the outside marshmallow.  It's served with raspberry puree, and another kind of puree (excuse my bad memory).   There's also a cup made out of some kind of sweet cracker thingie, filled with the most amazing whip cream and sliced fruit.  Ugh, just so good!  My server was very nice and entertaining, he explained everything perfectly and made excellent recommendations!   Overall I definitely enjoyed my experience here, and will hopefully have time to come back next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"If you like lukewarm, textureless, and peculiar tasting sushi than this is the place for you. The happy hour is a joke.   How about keeping the fish fresh instead of worrying about sprinkling multi colored fish eggs all over everything.   We ordered a \"platter\" for $36 that had 6 pieces of cut roll style sushi on it. We also ordered some king crab sushi which tasted like they stole it from the buffet. Usually we argue over the last piece of sushi, but in this case it was because no one wanted it. Every piece was warm, mushy, and disappointing. The last roll was literally wet and tasted like a half chewed ham and cheese sandwich.   We left hungry and with $150 less in our pockets."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, although coworkers have recommended it numerous times.   The service was excellent, the interior was pleasant but nit very private. We shared a circular booth that was centered in the main dining area. The seating however didn't bother us and the open spacious ceilings added to the liveliness of the crowd.  My only complaint was more than one of the items we wanted on the menu were not available. The food we did get was very good! The mushroom pasta and duck 2 ways were both wonderful entrees."}
{"text":"Ran in on lunch, grabbed a Moo Goo Gai Pan lunch special with brown rice. It was delicious and a great price at $5.99. I'll be back in."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. My husband and I are new to area (moved from Uptown Phoenix) and have been looking for some good Chinese food places locally. Our favs so far are China Chili on Flower Street and Shangri-La on Cactus Road - neither of which are near a hop-skip and a jump from us. We tried this place and while it was not bad, there was nothing that stood out about it. Flavor wise everything we had was bland and lacking seasoning. We had the pupu platter (basic fried items served with jarred sweet and sour sauce), sizzling rice soup (with barely any chicken - basically all rice and the rice was over cooked, perhaps even slightly burnt), orange chicken (mild flavor with more veggie than chicken), pork fried rice (slightly greasy and bland) and crazy hot beef (which was neither hot nor crazy with more veggie than meat). On a positive note, despite the food, the service was great! The staff was very attentive and friendly and had it not been for the mediocre food, we may have gone back based on the service alone, but alas we continue our search."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, waited one hour and a half. Called them back several times to be told we were out of delivery area. Horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"I'm brand new to Arizona and went through Yelp to see what was available for delivery. I happened upon China Grill and was pleasantly surprised. Wasn't crazy about the mussels didn't have a great flavor. The Bobo chicken was good with the almonds and so with the lettuce wraps. I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The Crispy Duck is one of my favorites! Very sweet and caring staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love China Grill.  We are originall from NY and this is the closet thing we have found to what we used to eat back home.  We always order the orange chicken and the pork fried rice is really really good.  The crab wontons could have more crab but otherwise they are pretty yummy.  We havent tried alot of their items but I did have the general Tsaos once and wasnt really impressed.  Overall really good Chinese."}
{"text":"I've been getting take out here for years! The menu here is very extensive and this are extremely affordable. They also have a delivery service here if you don't want to stop in to eat or pick up your take out. Pretty convenient I might add, since they guys are fast.   I usually get the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice. The egg rolls here are super delicious. I usually get two or three orders of the egg rolls, because they are that good! The sweet and sour pork is pretty tasty too. Also comes with soup, I usually get the hot and sour soup. Can't ever go wrong there.   They give you pretty large portions here too. So be hungry when you eat here. Haha  Hope my review helped. :)"}
{"text":"China Grill made me sad... I was hankering for some good Chinese food and decided to try something new, and I was sadly let down. I will say this - the lady that greeted me at the front was extremely welcoming and nice.  I ordered the crazy hot chicken (which was not so crazy hot), it just had a few jalapenos in it...not that it tasted bad, but it wasn't great and borderline plain. Also was not impressed with the sesame chicken or the super small sides of rice that came with our meal. I really don't mean to sound harsh, but I feel that there are a handful of other Chinese places where you can get better tasting food at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"We came to China Grill in 2003 and loved it so much that we couldn't wait to go to the NYC location when we returned. That said, we booked a reservation for our first night back in Vegas and were looking forward to a great meal.  Boy, were we disappointed. I ordered the riceless sushi and another hand roll variety, and they were AWFUL. The fish was flavorless, the rice was heavy, and the soy wrapper was gummy and had a lifeless texture. I have never experienced anything this bad, and don't believe that China Grill is paying a real sous chef to make this crap. The bus boy could have done better. At $17 per roll, this was a colossal rip off. We left hungry, and completely ticked off at the $125 tab. I get better sushi at my local Shop Rite.  If you decide to try China Grill, DO NOT order any of the sushi, as many Yelpers agree. My husband ordered a steak and mushroom dish that was decent, albeit tiny."}
{"text":"I took a few clients out to China Grill at Mandalay Bay last week.  We started during their happy hour which included drink specials and a complimentary appetizer.  They also had a discount appetizer menu.  We ordered a couple of rolls, edemame, and 2 lychee lemon drop martinis.  The martinis and apps were very good.  The complimentary appetizer was a friend pork and veggie potsticker with seaweed.  My customer was vegetarian so she didn't try it but I enjoyed it.  When the server found out she was a vegetarian he brought her out a different complimentary appetizer which was very nice of him.  It was tempura battered veggies with a delish sauce.  The veggie app was better then the pot sticker, LOL.  After happy hour, we went for dinner and ordered half portions of the asian chicken salad, shrimp, and ahi tuna.  We also ordered friend rice.  The portions were pretty big for half ordered and it was nice that each item was made to share.  For the entrees at dinner and 3 drinks the bill was $105 - I thought that was pretty good.  We were too full for dessert so we didn't try.  The service was fine, nothing to brag about, but nothing to complain about either.  I guess there is a China Grill in Chicago so since I had a good experience at this one I would definitely try the one in Chicago."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We love the crab puffs , orange chicken , Mongolian beef. Tonight we had Peking duck and crispy duck. We both enjoyed the Peking duck. The portion was huge enough for both of us. It was delicious. We still had the crispy duck which was good but we liked the Peking best. So next time we will share the Peking. We brought two boxes home.  4 legs, lots of meat and bowl of rice.   Very good service. Waitresses are just so friendly. We order lots of delivery and will continue."}
{"text":"I had high hopes! I love all things morgan hotel group! Asia De Cuba is one of my favorites country wide. We were in LV during chistmas time and found that the restaurant was empty! Well, we thought it would be great since all eyes would be on us and the service would be top notch. Well, the service was top notch but I swear it felt like they were swarming us. I guess they could have ignored us and would have been worse. Now on to the food. Welllll, it was Ok at best. Most of it was bland or too much of one spice i.e. salt or pepper. We had the tasting menu which we enjoyed bc we got to try a little of the most popular dishes. I want to think the chef was having an off night since it was so slow?? I hope?? Havent been to any of the other China Grill spots so I dont have anything else to compare it to. But the other reviews seem to coincide with what we came across...just OK experience for a place that should have wowed!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Ordered shrimp fried rice an it tasted more like steamed white rice with 4 total shrimps....why don't more Chinese restaurants actually fry their rice anymore??"}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in a very long time. I'm so excited to review this place i don't even know where to start...!  Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish! We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting.  Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it. We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness. Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees.  Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination. Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me. I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink.  We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio.   This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm going to steal Ben L's word: \"enjoyable\" Americanized Chinese fare in a hip and attractive setting within Mandalay Bay. However expect outrageously expensive prices for Chinese food.   Don't expect any authentic Chinese fare here. Expect Americanized Chinese dishes that are catered toward the varied touristy crowd that hits Vegas. We had these appetizers:   Noodles (forgot what kind) - pretty good Calamari salad - pretty tasty Beef dumpling appetizer - okay, nothing special Short rib  - tender and okay Lamb off the ribs - alright  Most of these appetizers were ~$20 each. Granted the portions were slightly bigger to accomodate family style, but c'mon who charges $20 per appetitizer for something like dumplings and noodles?!  Bottom line: Hip atmosphere, some tasty dishes, friendly and helpful service but not authentic Chinese and rather hefty prices."}
{"text":"This place is great! I normally get it to go but this time we decided to eat at the restaurant. I didn't have any complaints before but eating in the restaurant made my option/review better. Give it a shot! Always great tasting food, made fresh, and fast!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite Chinese place here, love the white meat option. Lunch specials are a great deal and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is where the old crew from the China Gate restaurant that used to be at Metro Center (10+ yrs ago) re-opened. This is the best traditional chinese food in the valley. They also make the BEST mixed cocktails in town. Have a Zombie and the Bo-Bo chicken (the old China Gate Chicken)."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. The food is authentic and delicious, and the service is amazing! We eat here every week or two since we moved to the valley and have yet to find a restaurant that is as good."}
{"text":"Not being from the Phoenix area and not familiar with the Peoria area, my wife & I were looking for a Chinese restaurant. We decided upon China Grill on Thunderbird and were really glad we did. Located in the Basha's Center at 75th & Thunderbird, it appears from the outside as almost a fast food place with only several tables for dining. Again, we were surprised. The area in front is a small bar set up with a large screen TV showing sporting events. The hostess took us into a back area which is for dining . Quite large , yet intimate, and completely full indicated a popular place. The waitress quickly took our drink order as we checked out the menu. A complete menu of favorites with many unusual and innovative dishes. We had the egg rolls and wontons for appetizers, which were brought out piping hot ! Main course, my wife had the sesame chicken. Outstanding meal with a very unique sesame sauce. I had the crazy family which is stir-fried beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp in a jalapeno based sauce !  Was seasoned just right for myself who enjoys hot sauces. I would recommend China Grill to anyone and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So I might be a spoiled American but I have to say I was definitely disappointed at the portion size I recieved when I ordered my BBQ Pork appetizer. While the strips did taste good they were gone just a little to fast. The eggrolls are decent, not the best ive ever had but definitely edible.   My entree was delicious. I ordered the braised bean curd (tofu), which came with some steamed rice and it was very good. The pork fried rice was pretty good too along with the chicken chow mein. Overall I think this place was definitely worth visiting and I'll probably be coming back but its not the kind of place you rave about to all your friends. If your looking for good food and a small businesses family atmosphere this place is for you. If you are looking for somewhere to impress a date with your excellent taste maybe think about going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago, for our last night of a business trip in Vegas for a change from all the buffets we were eating the nights prior.   Service:  All the staff at China Grill are wonderful. We made reservations, and were taken to our table immediately. Our waiter, Lars, was very helpful, described each dish as they came out, and even gave us his personal recommendations.   Food: We were a group of 7, and decided to get the \"Classics Tasting Menu,\" - which was amazing! This 6 course, pre-set menu was absolutely to die for! If you're looking to try a few of their delicious menu items, the tasting menu is definitely the best way!   I was also new to Asian Fusion food, and will admit a little skeptical about what combinations there would be, but after this night, I am most definitely a fan!   My favorites had to be:  -Crackling Calamari Salad - part of the trio of salads included -Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings -Grilled Szechuan Beef - cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious -Crispy Spinach - not usually a fan of spinach, but it was made like seasoned seaweed.  -Wasabi Mashed Potatoes - they had the perfect amount of wasabi, not over powering  and last but not least: (for dessert) -Cheesecake Pot Stickers - MUST TRY! they sound odd, but after dipping these little golden triangles of goodness in the trio of sauces, that first bite is heaven!"}
{"text":"After eating at a buffet for lunch, we were looking for a lighter meal.  We weren't consciously looking for anything expensive, but had happened to end up in Mandalay Bay with a very tired 3 year old.  The menu at China Grill caught our eye because they provided half plates and the food looked interesting.  We decided that ordering an appetizer and an entree to share wouldn't be too expensive and ducked in.  Despite the place being really too nice to bring a 3 year old in, it actually worked out.  A sippy cup of juice, low lighting, and a quiet restaurant worked their charm and he was out like a light, allowing us to eat a very, nice meal in peace.  We ordered the pork belly appetizer and the duck two ways.  I had never had pork belly before and this was delicious (although I don't think I will order another one for a few years!).  It came with two salads, watermelon and avocado. Delicious.  The duck two ways was obviously inspired by Peking duck and was supplied with delicious little crepes to roll our duck in.  Very, very good.  Loved the chocolate-orange sauce. We also shared a cucumber mojito, which was a very refreshing drink.  All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the food.  The only problem was the price.  Half orders of one appetizer, menu item, one cocktail and juice came out to about $60!  A little too expensive for us, but the food was memorable."}
{"text":"I typically order delivery from China Grill, and it is fast, hot and very inexpensive if ordered at lunch time.   I've eaten in house once and really like it, they are very friendly and never have messed up my order or anything like that.  Great place to bring friends and family for some good eats"}
{"text":"This neighborhood spot dishes out some fresh Chinese American style food. We had fried wontons for an appetizer and they were crisp and hot and delicious. Edamame tasted like it should. The house lo mien had variety of meats and was a bit oily but not a deal breaker. The cashew chicken was big chunks of chicken and veggies with lots of cashews. Fried rice is average at best. But from what I remember they don't charge for the upgrade from white rice. So I got that going for me."}
{"text":"First off, on a Saturday night, this was the only restaurant in the entire hotel that didn't have a wait. We were starving so we decided to try this place. The seating inside is pretty awkward, tables of 2 going in a circle with booths in the outer ring. We were seated in a table for 2, in very close proximity of the other tables (not very comfortable at all). Minus one star. The ceiling was pretty cool, the hostess said this place was formerly a club... The lighting was really dim so I was struggling to read the menu. Note: bring a flashlight! The menus were really awkward as well! A big circle menu, laminated, and tacky.   I should've known it would be a bad experience since it was Asian fusion and Chinese with Japanese = disaster. I also received a dirty plate, which is hard to tell when you are in dim lighting. The sake menu was pretty lame and the prices were outrageous! We were starving so we ordered a lot of food.   We started out with an assortment of rolls~spicy tuna roll, philadelphia roll, crunchy roll, and california roll. They were ok, the sauces were a bit strange though. The Philadelphia roll came with a pesto sauce which did not match at all. Then we had the chicken salad. The small portion was huge! It was good but I wish they used a stronger vinaigrette since it was bland. The sesame oil did not help to perk up the dish. The side portion of duck fried rice was pretty good but the duck was very dry like beef jerky! I ate the fried rice and took the pieces of duck out. We ordered a large entree of the barbequed salmon. The salmon was dry, very fishy,  and overcooked. I did not like it at all. The vegetables were tasty though.   Service was pretty slow. The party of two sat after we ordered and they got their food before us and left before us! That pissed me off. Our dinner took 2 hours! We wanted to cancel our food just so we could get out of there. I will not be coming back. Food was mediocre and overpriced for the low quality. Service was bad."}
{"text":"I was happy that we chose to eat here for dinner a few weeks ago. Since we had to catch a show at 8pm, we came here around 6 and so we were in time for the fixed menu, which is between 5 and 7pm. There were five of us and it is $39 per person for 2 apps, 3 entrees and 3 desserts. I thought there wouldn't be enough food for all of us but surprisingly the portions were large and we couldn't even finish off our dessert! All of the dishes were good, esp. the cesar salad which is done with an asian flair. The only negative is that it is so dark in there that I could hardly see my food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing fried rice but everything else was great! The fried rice was really just slightly brown rice with a couple peas and carrots thrown in. But the crab puff, Mongolian beef, and sesame chicken were very yummy. Our server was very nice and friendly and prices were good!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The big test was if my husband liked it. He is not a huge Chinese food fan. Well he loved it.  We ordered the\"Happy Family\", because I wanted sea food and he wanted steak and chicken. It was delicious. Highly recommend. Less than $30 for the two is us."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. My favorite are the chicken lettuce wraps. Sooo good. Everything I've had has been good. I've been there about 5 times so far. Service is very good too."}
{"text":"We order at least once a month and it never fails to disappoint. The vegetables are cooked perfectly every time and the sauces are fantastic! Kung Pao is my favorite."}
{"text":"$40 for 6 spicy beef dumplings and two Sapporo's!  During Happy Hour!  Insane.    We did enjoy it though and we were in Vegas on our first vacation together in years so we were splurging.  The dumplings are decent in size and R absolutely loved them.  I thought they were alright but I was almost more fond of the salad that they were served with.  I think I've had better dumplings before.  I guess to ease the sticker shock of your meal you receive two pork and vegetable potstickers \"compliments of the chef\" after you place your order.  They were delicious.  The Sapporos were good too!    It was definitely a cool spot but not for the thrifty.  The bartender was nice, attentive guy.  I thought the community table they had was a cool idea, basically you share an enormous table with 14-16 strangers rather than be seated at an individal table.  The ambiance and style of the restaurant is cool and sexy, this is a place to go for a romantic evening.  I'd try this place for dinner if I had some extra cash burning a hole in my pocket..."}
{"text":"Start off with the positive. Food was good. The service was terrible. Everything was slow. The waiter pushed us into a fixed course meal. I was assuming it was to get the meal out in a timely manner. Even with the fixed menu we were always waiting on the next course. My wine arrived as I finished the meal. Lots of excuses from the waiter when it really was not very crowded. With so many options around I would say take a pass."}
{"text":"We decided to venture over to China Grill after hearing they offer a happy hour from 4 - 7 in their bar and lounge.  The restaurant is beautiful.  The waterfalls behind the velvety booths set a lovely mood.  Our service was excellent throughout.  That said, this happy hour is a sham!  The offer sushi rolls from $5 - $9.50.  Unfortunately they are half sized! What a crock.  $9.50 for 4 pieces of sushi roll doesn't exactly qualify as an enticing happy hour.  Furthermore, the beers are $7.  Um......how much are they normally??? That's not a happy hour price.    There is a rum drink, a vodka lemonade, red or white wine, and hot sake for $5.  So, skip the food, enjoy one of the afformentioned reasonably priced beverages and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my second favorite Chinese food place in Phoenix. It eat here all the time and the food is always good. The customer service is always great. Everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"Saturday night was girls night out, we were going to a concert at the Mandalay Bay Event Center so we decided to start the night with dinner at China Grill. We rolled into China Grill an hour after our reservation, but the hostess was still able to accommodate us which was nice.   The decor at China Grill is modern and sexy, on the darker side... We were trying to figure out how we could sneak out with one of the awesome lamps.   Our server was friendly, he explained that China Grill serves food that is meant to be shared... Like Asian tapas... And that we should expect what we order to come out one-by-one. We decided to get the lobster pancakes (more like a crepe then your grandma's pancakes our server explained) as a starter while we decided on some sushi. For drinks we decided to skip the $12-15 special drinks and got a couple rounds of hot sake and Sapporo to do sake bombs.   The lobster pancakes came out fairly quickly, and at that point we decided to order 2 full rolls (Philly and Spicy Tuna) as well as a half roll (Dragon). The sushi was very slow to come out.. so slow we had to order another round of drinks... Thankfully we had allowed 2.5 hours for dinner, even with our lateness and the sushi chef's slowness we made it to the concert right on time.  The Philly roll was my favorite of the night. Salmon was on top instead of inside like some places do, you seem to get more fish that way, always a plus. The fish also tasted very fresh. The Spicy Tuna roll was the spiciest I think I have ever had, no need for extra wasabi on these! The Dragon roll was good but it had shrimp and crab, I am used to Dragon rolls being eel. My fault for not reading the menu more carefully.   I have no idea what our bill came to, one of my sneaky girlfriends snagged the check before we could split up the costs. It's the Strip though, if you go expect to spend $40-50 dollars per person, and preparty if dropping $15 a drink is not your cup of tea."}
{"text":"I had a meeting at the Bay and afterward I was starved.  Rather than go back to my hotel, I decided to check out one of the Chinese restaurants at the Bay.    My first choice, Shanghai Lilly, was closed so I walked across the hall to China Grill.  It was very good.  But it was also very expensive and the portion sizes didn't do much for me either.  Overall, I won't go back but if you're there, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"Won't ever eat there again ordered delivery the Mongolian beef was very old called spoke to mgr I was called a liar won't ever eat there again"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  My Fav is the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Don't ever eat anywhere else for the most part, and certainly don't go to panda anymore. They offer carry out & delivery! :)"}
{"text":"The food: 2-3 stars.   Environment: 5 stars.   I love the environment. However, I would have never tried if it wasn't for my boss treating us to a group dinner after conference. It's very relaxed, layed back, and it has an happy hour in the afternoon where appetizers are cheap and drinks are 50% off. It's Vegas, and it's inside Mandalay Bay, so the price is not going to be cheap.   Now to the food. It is a very unique fusion Chinese-Japanese-American Style. I don't think it would survive if it wasn't located in such a touristy area. However, it is definitely worth trying if you have extra cash in Vegas.   It can be romantic, casual, or whatever special occasion you like it to be. Just don't give too high of an expectation on the food being authentic. Don't get me wrong, it's tasty, just not authentic!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant when we're in the mood for traditional Chinese food.  Friendly service, very good food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at China Grill several times.  I always enjoy the food and service.  The food is modern Chinese with a flare. The portions are perfect and the flavors are wonderful.  I always get the steak dish with the onion rings (I forget the name of the dish).  I would highly recommend if you are in the Vegas area.  Food is pricey, but worth it.  The bathroom is also pretty cool."}
{"text":"Love love love their takeout! I've had dinner in their restaurant once and it was decent. The restaurant is a bit outdated but clean and super quiet. The food is the reason I stick with this place. We always order the Kung Pao Chicken - all white meat, the Teriyaki chicken - all white meat, and the Orange Chicken. We do get their crab puffs every once in awhile and their egg rolls are mediocre as well. Their sauces are really good and the meat they use is good quality - I'm particular with my meat!   Their service is good; quick and to the point. They don't do alot of chit chat which I like, and they are friendly enough to make you want to come back. They usually have my take out ready in 15 minutes or less; even during lunch rush.   This is always our go to Chinese take out and will be until they prove it wrong!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese in the valley. Really fresh and great tasting ingrediants. if your a fan of crab puffs you WON'T be dissapointed best crab puffs ive tasted ever..."}
{"text":"Sushi and drinks were quite tasty, but disproportionately expensive, even for happy hour.  I think this is common for the Mandalay Bay restaurants, but it was a bit shocking coming from San Francisco, or even from other hotels in Las Vegas.  Service and ambiance were excellent and definitely make up for the price somewhat, especially for snacks during happy hour, or for a meal if you've just won big in the casino or just want to act like you have."}
{"text":"By far the best authentic chinese food I have had, keep in mind this is no PF changs, but it's the real deal. Polite on point service, and the food is fantastic. My drink was never empty, and my stomach was full and I was seriously pleased with my expierience, this place use to be located next to chipotle on 33rdish ave and peoria by metrocenter, the same family still works there minus the huge fish tank. I enjoy the general tso's chicken,  the mu shu wraps, and the orange chicken. This place is it!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.   I think China Grill is suppose to be exotic dining destination for the Panda Express crowd and fine dining for PF Chang's Bistro followers, but that in itself is another problem.    The first clue should have been when I spied sushi on the menu of a restaurant named \"China Grill\", um, China, not Japan, however since the food is categorized as \"Asian fusion\" and after several drive-by's of the Miami Beach location, where it always appears to be hopping, we decided to give the Las Vegas location a try.   Overall, it was a very uneventful and boring meal, which consisted of beef dumplings starters, a green salad, which had no hints of Asian spice or flavor and an entree of sliced beef, which tasted no more than grilled beef with soy sauce.   Given the outrageous prices charged for all the menu items, of which I would have not have had an issue with if each of the appetizers and entrees had been prepared with more creativity, I think most guests would be better off going to an actual Chinese or Asian food restaurant over this unimaginative restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a large group dinner at China Grill after a party at Red Square.  It was an expense account evening, so extravagance was the order of the day.  There were eight of us and we ate A LOT. Appetizers were the tempura sashimi, lamb ribs, crab cakes and dumplings. All were quite tasty and they went fast.  For entrees, we each ordered an entree, but they insisted on serving us family style...so everyone was sampling each others dinner. A bit of a snafu when it came to my order.  I asked for the butterfish (with a miso sauce) but was told that they were out.  I then ordered the salmon.  I waited and waited...and no salmon.  I finally flagged our waiter and he went to check.  Then he sheepishly came back and told me that they were out of the salmon...NOT the butterfish.  So, I got butterfish after all..much to the chagrin of one of my mates who also wanted the butterfish and settled for a vegetarian foodfest.  Service was good...ambiance was okay.  We had the loudest group in Las Vegas at the next table.  They were shouting and laughing so loud, we couldn't hear our conversation. One final word about the bathrooms.  Check them out....you go through a beaded curtain and then you find like five white pyramids.....each contains a bathroom.  Strange.  So, a decent meal, solid Asian fusion cuisine.  Good for a group and very tasty."}
{"text":"We had tix to Mamma Mia in Mandalay and were just looking for a quick bite before the meal and this was such a gem of a find. The menu is creative, the service was terrific (our waiter looked like Prince Harry, no joke) and the food was seriously good.   It was just me and my sister so we could only try three dishes, but we hit a homerun on our choices: spicy  meat dumplings, chicken salad, and garlic prawn over squid ink pasta. We ate every drip.  And when we told our Prince Harry waiter that we were going to the show he made sure all our food was out quickly and kept checking on us and even had to remind us to get moving. If we had time, we would have definitely had dessert and sat around for awhile. Very beautiful place to eat and we felt very lucky to find it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and I'm usually hesitant about Asian Fusion food. It might have converted me. We got the Tasting Menu, which was a good choice because we literally got to try everything. Usually in my experience, the nicer restaurants have smaller portions, but this was not the case. We had enough leftover food that could have fed us for another meal or so.   I absolutely loved their crackling calamari salad, crispy spinach because it reminded me of the Korean seaweed snack, grilled szechuan beef, and cheesecake potsticker (dessert). I surprisingly liked the wasabi mashed potatoes.  Our waiter, Lars, was attentive and very helpful. You could tell he cared about the food since he seemed awfully concerned when it looked like no one was going to eat the last cheesecake potsticker.   The bathrooms were a little too odd for me because they reminded me of high end porta-potties. They also had mini tv screens playing music videos next to the toilet. Awkward."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner after a long flight from Hawaii.  I ate at the bar, and orders some appetizers and the fish.  The food was not appetizing at all, and the portions were very small.  The ambiance and service were great, but I found the food sub-par for such a restaurant.  I may try this place again."}
{"text":"I am definitely biased after living in Seattle but I didn't think this place was anything special. I wouldn't return. Egg Flower soup was bland. My hot and sour was a little bit better. The General Tsao chicken wasn't spicy at all. The server was really nice but that only makes up for so much."}
{"text":"Not sure how I forgot to add my review here. We love China grill for date nights. It's a bit of a drive from our house, but we are always seated quickly and the service is always wonderful. My favorite item is probably the sweet and sour chicken. The portions are large and the lunch specials come with soup and egg roll. The restaurant is always very clean and the atmosphere relaxing. I love that it is quiet enough to have great conversation with family and friends."}
{"text":"So we went here, cause we were staying at Mandalay Bay for the RE/MAX Convention.  They advertised $5 drinks and sushi in the bar area, so in we went.  You have to order from a special menu in order to get this price, and I can assure you, the sushi was not $5.  Service was creeping along ... took forever to get a glass of wine.  It was actually $5, but the Grey Goose and Grapefruit my friends ordered was not.  My friend got some sort of crab roll that tasted bad ... she was doubled over in pain by the end of the night.  The Philadelphia roll was o-kay.  I ordered the Volcano Roll and Spicy Tuna roll, both of which were good.  We got free edamame because of the lame service.   Overall ... less than average dining experience."}
{"text":"General Tsao Chicken is wonderful. So is the wonton soup. This is a regular destination for my daughter and me to meet for dinner and catch up. The owner is a wonderful lady who once owned the restaurant at Metro called China Gate. My daughter grew up her entire life eating Chinese food there as we had a business nearby and I was always to exhausted to cook after the super long days we worked our store. So it's a comfort having that great food available still. And the service is wonderful too."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this place. Heck, first time I've eaten at a fancy restaurant (Fancy meaning EXPENSIVE). At first we wanted to eat at a buffet, but we always eat at a buffet every time were at Vegas. We wanted to try something different and not a buffet period.   Service: Hostess was great on seating us right away. Waiter was pretty cool as well. Food was not serve all at the same time but we did get notified at the begin that it wouldn't. Because food was being prepared as you ordered them.  Food: I'll break it down as it came.  Appetizer: Crab cakes. Now do understand I have tried crab cakes before at local restaurant near me, but none can compare to this one. It melted in you mouth. Big on flavor and the portion was right for the price.   Salad: Peking duck Salad Then we had the Peking duck salad. Bold in flavor and portion was pretty huge so start with the half.  Entree:  First that came was the Char siu baby back pork ribs. My son loved it with his rice. It came with a jicama slaw and dried apple slices. It was okay. I had better ribs.  Second came the grilled garlic shrimp with black fettuccine and red curry coconut sauce. This was my absolute favorite. Now if your think cause it says \"curry\" it might be spicy, not at all. It was great.   Last came grilled szechuan beef. It was pretty great too. With had it with the five vegetable fried rice and plain steam rice.   No dessert cause we were full."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple years ago and the food was good, however, the past few months it has been terrible! The lo mein was bland, and some of the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was rock hard. And holy ginger, egg rolls! They were absolutely disgusting, I spit it out! I thought maybe they just had an off night and tried again, but same thing. Never again!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to dine \"family style\" with a big group.  Our group of 8 ordered practically half the menu!  Portions are adequate, though some (like the Kobe Beef Tartar, a favorite at the table) could've been just a bit bigger.  The 2 standouts for me were the Lobster Pancakes and the Grilled Garlic Shrimp.    Service was excellent, very attentive in just the right doses.  Everything on the specialty cocktail menu looked divine.  I opted for the Lychee Mojito.  To.  Die.  For."}
{"text":"My coworkers decided we should try this for lunch one day. It was definitely worth it. The Honey Crispy chicken is so great. Food is always hot and ready for pickup when I get there. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice place with good menu items. However I felt the drink I ordered was under poured and over priced based on other restaurants I order scotch on the rocks at. If they did not over charge for alcohol I would give four stars and go more often myself."}
{"text":"Because my friends and I came here right before our night out on the town I was forced to order light, being in a far too tight dress and all. So, out of sheer necessity, I ordered a salad.   Usually, this girl does not order salads; why, you ask? Well, because, it is a waste of money; I can throw vegetables together at home for a fraction of the price that same dish would cost me at a restaurant. So, when I eat out I order hearty to ensure I get my money's worth.   That was my POV, until I tried China Girll's Cracking Calamari Salad. There are no words to describe how excellent this salad tasted. It was superb, the absolute best salad I have ever had the pleasure of eating.   It was so good that after a taste of my salad, a member of my party returned her previous order and subsequently ordered the same thing.  I can't even describe what they may have put in that salad, but all I know is the next time and every other time I am in Vegas, I can be found sitting blissfully content at China Grill,  eating a Calamari Salad."}
{"text":"Very very affordable. Wasn't a fan of the Mongolian beef or the kung pow, the beef was dry and the chicken was pretty small and didn't have much spice. But I did like the hot and sour soup and the egg rolls. My husband got the hunan chicken and that was really good. Service was amazing everyone here is very polite. They also decorated the place for the holidays, place looks very festive. Their lunch specials come with rice, soup, and a mini egg roll which a great deal! My kids loved it. We will come back but will probably try other entrees."}
{"text":"-1 for the food, we had the garlic shrimp and schezwan beef,  didnt taste anything garlic about the shrimp and the beef was dry. -1 for the price, 100 for two, you'd expect great things... -1 for mediocre service, asking for refills shouldn't be necessary when your paying this much. -1 for misrepresentation, there's nothing chinese about this grill.  Sorry, but the chinese food at Studio B buffet is better lol."}
{"text":"stopped in here for happy hour before a show. Found a nice spot at the bar & ordered one of the $5 drinks on the HH menu. It was some kind of rum punch. And it was very good! I had 3 of them & had a nice buzz when I left. I decided to try some food and ordered the spicy tuna roll & cucumber salad. It hit the spot just right. I just wanted a light snack and thats what it was. The bartenders were awesome. Bringing me water/soy etc. I would come back again for happy hour."}
{"text":"After three lunch visits I've come to the conclusion that this restaurant fares just ok in my book.  I'll probably be back, but can't guarantee it as there are so many other places to try.  Upon walking in you are quickly and politey greeted, then taken to a table.  You'll notice the decor is nice, but somewhat cluttered.  I'm not a fan of things not put in its right place.  Maybe this is just me?  Great price for lunch and it comes out quickly as expected.  I was hoping for a little more love to be put into the food as my tongue was telling me that it was a little bland.  Each visit I tried a different item from the menu and it almost all tasted the same.  Overall this place serves its purpose for a quick, hot, inexpensive meal while not for the typical foodie."}
{"text":"Very impressed Great food, crispy honey chicken was very good."}
{"text":"This is a hard review, I've never experienced anything like this place. Usually food is either good or bad, end of story. I love the entrees , they are inspired and tasty, the chef has a deft hand with his spices and flavors (not just the usual garlic and oyster sauce) BUT (and this is a HUGE but) the appetizers have proved to be consistently disappointing. On my first visit (see previous review), I raved about the main courses but was less than impressed with the appetizers and agreed to go back again to give them a second chance.After all anyone can have an off night in the kitchen. Well, once again, major disappointment. This time I ordered the \"Award Winning\" creamy crab puffs (AKA crab rangoon where I come from) one of my personal all time favs and some dried, I mean fried, won-tons. The crab puffs were overcooked and hard (not crispy) so much so that i had to beak off all the edges and just eat the middle which was just average. More cream than crab and very bland - no puff about it. The fried wontons were also overcooked and in addition to looking like a small marble, were as hard as one. These were the smallest wontons I have ever seen. The filling was rolled into a very tight tiny ball the size of a small marble and were so uniform in size I believe they were a mass produced frozen product and not fresh made. Once again I broke off the hard edges, the middle was blah, very little flavor couldn't even identify what it was made of. An order of 8 is $4.95- Outrageous considering their diminutive size..all 8 could fit into the palm of your hand - and nondescript flavor. So, between the previous experience of ice cold BBQ beef on a stick and cabbagy bland egg rolls and this most recent debacle, I give up. I can only recommend them for their entrees which are so good I will go back for just those. ..hence my two star rating which would be a one if those entrees weren't so good. The service isn't so hot either, servers/waiters/counter help are pretty blase. Sigh, I guess nothing is perfect and I'll have to go down the street to PF Chang's for my appetizers which I will do considering the lack of options for good ole' back home Chinese food in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place was a letdown. With all the places in Vegas to eat and enjoy sushi I thought it would be better, but I was wrong. It took us 15 minutes to get help after we were seated and the waiter was a complete ass. He even went as far as telling us to hurry up and order when we were choosing appetizers.   The service is slow, the drinks are meh and the food is nothing to write home about.   Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"my first review..  i read them alll the time on here, and after following some reviews and decided to eat here.  the service was amazing, the food was even better.. some of the freshest chinese i have had in AZ.. the variety you can order from is extensive to any tastes you or your family might have.. the atmosphere is versatile as well, good for a quick bite or a nice date.  i felt like i needed to write one in regards to the \"Andrew C.\" person.. this guy must have never had chinese food to believe this is akin to pei wei .. or even less asian than it.  he probably ordered the most american dish he saw. he must be a sweet n sour lover (not that there is anything wrong withthat)"}
{"text":"Amazingly this place had a vegan/vegetarian menu.  Unfortunately at China Grill, vegetarian equals bland.   The only item I truly enjoyed was the baby lettuce salad, dressing was good, anything with heart of palm and artichoke is usually a fav."}
{"text":"Revisited the China Grill last weekend during a trip to Las Vegas.  We tried the 'new\" Sampling Menu.  It's a little pricey at $72.00 per person but soooo worth it.  The food again comes in family style servings.  Way to much food to eat with a total of six dishes.    The sampling menu gave me the opportunity to try different dishes as I normally end up ordering the same thing most times.  The Cesar Salad rocked.  It has cashews and crisp won tons instead of croutons.  It's my new favorite salad and going to make it for the next time I entertain!  I still love the China Grill.  Kudos also to the lychee mojitos."}
{"text":"My second time to China Grill (last time about 5 yrs) with a party of 5 adults and 2 kids on a Sunday dinner before a show. The dining room is very well design, but a bit dark, we were seated near the open kitchen and didn't mind.   Started with the appetizer of a full order Curried Chicken Satay with chilled sesame noodles, very tasty. Cocktail were good, I had a Red Dragon, very refreshing. Services was very attentive and the main entrees were served at a good pace. Many of the entrees we order were full orders because we had 7 people, which was plenty. The Wild Mushroom Profusion Pasta was excellent. Follow by the Duck 2 Ways very good, Sake Drunken Chicken with Asian slaw , Moroccan Lamb Ossobuco, and half order of the Miso Veggie & Udon Noodles. Portion size were OK, was happy with all the main dishes, the accompaniments we had were Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, (portion was larger the last time) and the 5 vegetable fried rice was OK. 7 total order on the table was more than enough, we could skip the Udon though. Billed was $336 tax & tip with drinks, not too bad!! (Remember you could have lost that much at gambling in less than a hour!!) We skip dessert because we want to have it after the show else where as a nite cap. Will go back again when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Go to use their cool bathroom tents.  Stay to have their air-fried spinach."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food! Hunan chicken is spicy and delicious! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2006!  Love you Miss Anne!!  Andi you are an awesome chef!!  My favorite to start off course is crab puffs.   Sizzling rice soup  beef chofun with jasmine tea.   Service can be a bit chaotic but always nice!"}
{"text":"There's one word to describe this restaurant and that is BLAND.  I had such high hopes. The atmosphere is really cool, and the menu mostly sounded great but everything else was disappointing.  I was first put off by how hard the waiter was pushing tasting menu which of course included multiple salads, appetizers and entr√©es. The hard sell was annoying. Then my Mojito was flat.   We opted to order off the regular menu and started with the beef dumplings which were tasty.  For our main dishs we shared the grilled tuna and the beef with lomain and vegetable fried rice.  Everything looked pretty but was completely tasteless. I asked for extra sauces and even these were bland.  Disappointing because there are so many other restaurants in Mandalay Bay that are probably much better.   Oh well."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant Many hits on the menu, good for groups and perfect post trade show meal.  Many hits on the menu, some of my favs inc: Spicy beef & scallion dumplings Confucius chicken salad Sake marinated \"drunken\" chicken"}
{"text":"My wife is from China, so there are not many places she likes to go. Usually when we want to go out, it's either the Cultural Center on 44th st or Great Wall on 35th and Camelback, which are both far from Peoria. I'm glad we found this place. We have been a couple of times already and really enjoy it. We were there recently with a group and I don't think there was one thing we didn't enjoy. The cucumber salad was good; my favorites were the crispy duck, the pork with green beans and the rice noodles with beef and onion. Even the egg drop soup was better than many places. I had gotten into a habit to just put soy sauce in any egg drop soup because usually they are bland, but not here. I'm glad I listened to my wife to taste it first and she was right."}
{"text":"Like everything in Vegas - it's lavish, it's decadent and it looks beautiful.  I love the decor of the place.  Did you know it's bathroom was featured in a Top 10 list of coolest bathrooms on the Travel Channel?  You walk through a wall of beads to get to the bathroom, every bathroom is it's own mini room complete with television that appears in the wall when you close the door behind you. It's not an actual tv - it's more like it's a screen being projected onto the wall in front of you.  It's so cool.   I recommend ordering several dishes and sharing with your entire table."}
{"text":"EEk! me thinks not is the reaction im looking for... This place is pricey and the sushi was not fresh at all. and the portions are super small.. I've had way better sushi else where.. The servers were average, which is suprising for a restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay. The water was not accurate with our order, he was not even writing anything down when we were ordering.. And of course he forgot an order, which was fine with us because we just wanted to GET OUT OF THERE! I would not reccomend this place for sushi.. I havent tried their other stuff on menu , not really interested after that experience. The only amazing thing about this place was they had televisions all in their toilets! I would not not eat here i would just use their toilets! haha"}
{"text":"Very standard Chinese restaurant joint. I had the lunch social moo goo gai pan dish which came with an egg roll, fried rice, and egg flower soup. Nothing extraordinary but nothing terrible. They are relatively fast on service which is nice for a lunch break."}
{"text":"It's difficult to impress a Chinese person with \"fancy\" Chinese food; it either end up tasting like Panda Express (no offense, I do crave orange chicken sometimes), or just overpriced dish you can get at an average Chinese restaurant for half or third of the price (shrug)  China Grill was fantastic when I went, majorly due to the person i was with (wink)  anyway, back to what I ate and what I think about them =)  Spicy Beef & Scallion Dumplings - the beef was dry for dumpling standard, boohoo, skip it Crispy Spinach - so incrediably tasty and very fun to eat! Lobster Mashed Potato - how often can you find this dish on a menu? its all so velvety, buttery and melt-in-your-mouth like, yum yum yum =) Sweet Soy Marinated Skirt Steak - flavorful and tender, highly recommanded Pan Seared Spicy Tuna - cooked and seasoned to perfection, impressive! and the sweet finish... Banana in a Box - what's that you wonder? its a 4-walled rectangular box about half a foot high made of hardened carmel, and filled with warm bananas and carmel cream, drizzelled with more carmel n chocolate (of course).  super delish!  Fancy Chinese restaurant such as this one is worth the $$$$ and dress up for after all =)"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and it was absolutely delicious.  Would have given a 5 but realized that I didn't pay for my own meal, so I tempered it to a four.  Went in a large group and we didn't know what to get, so the server suggested a tasting menu (I have no idea how much this cost).  Some dishes of note (ones that I found to be good): -Spicy Beef & Scallion Dumplings -Kalbi Ribeye (artichoke potato hash side was good too) -Grilled Garlic Shrimp -Five Vegetable Fried Rice  Dishes that were ok: -All the salads -Lobster Pancakes -Short ribs (doesn't come with many... maybe 2?)  I was too full to have dessert or the wasabi mashed potatoes.  Overall very good.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since 1989, it used to be china gate and I love it. If you want greasy nasty Chinese food don't order from here because its not like that. I order the Moo goo gai pan and it rocks. It has garlic sauce and white meat, it's perfect. The staff are very sweet. The man who delivers to my house is just the nicest, he picked up all of my newspapers in the driveway. Back to the food , it's fresh and tastes great. The only thing is I wish the family dinner came with 4 crab puffs and egg rolls not 2 because there are 4of us and I wish the egg drop would go back to the original recipe with the corn and I would love it if the chicken and vegetables went back to having the  little corn and happy black mushrooms in it. Either way I woul never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and tasty, well sized dishes all served for sharing.  The calamari salad is a great starter. Refreshing salad with some fried calamari. The duck three ways was also excellent. Great service. They kept the food flowing and we ordered the perfect amount for the three of us. Reasonably priced for the quality and casino-hotel location."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful dining experience.  For the appetizer, we tried their gyoza and for dinner we had the butterfish and sake chicken.   The quantities were large and we couldn't finish all our food.  The gyoza actually wasn't that great (we love dumplings, but these were by far not even close to the best we've had (I've actually cooked frozen ones that tasted better and had a better texture and were more moist than these.  I'd probably recommend trying something else for an appetizer.    The fish was wonderful, although the person I was with thought it felt slimy and didn't want it after the first few bites.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the chicken (a full 1/2 chicken, nonetheless).    The atmosphere was great and sat in the main room with the large dome light feature that was pretty cool to look at.  The bathrooms that people rave about wasn't that great, really ... it was a bit dirty, vandalized, and I just wanted to \"do my business\" and get back to the table.  The service was OK and not that attentive, but when they were around, they were acceptably friendly.   The food is close to 4 star good, but overpriced and the service mediocre which brought it back down to a 3.  We paid $175 for two people for an appetizer, two entrees, a side (wasabi mashed potatoes), 3 alcholic drinks, plus tip."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and used delivery. Everything was great! Good as well as customer service..... I would have given five stars had my crazy hot beef had any beef in it. It had maybe five little pieces of beef and a ton of veggies.....maybe they should just call it crazy hot vegetables."}
{"text":"The 3.5 average yelp rating is about right for this place! I'm nice though, so I'll round up..  Service was inconsistent. We had managers coming by our table every minute to ask how things were, but we had to ask THREE people for freaking soy sauce, and it ended up being a 15 minute ordeal. Then they accidentally took it away between courses.. another 3 people and 15 minutes were required to return it. Soy sauce shouldn't be this difficult people!  Drinks: Seriously terrible, as in the worst drinks I've had in awhile. There were 3 of us and we all ordered various drinks (mojito, vodka drink, martini) all just royally sucked. however, I do feel bad counting this against them as the manager did ask how the drinks were and I just said they were fine.. I should have said \"they suck!\".   Food: The fried sashimi was very eh, so I was worried about our entrees. Luckily these saved the day! We had the soy marinated skirt steak, the duck 2 ways, and the duck fried rice. It was all heavenly. The steak was super tender, the duck was fab, and the duck fried rice was a hearty portion and full of duck for $12.   Bill was $200 with tax/tip for 3 people. I'd skip the whopping $45 in drinks next time! The entrees are pricey, but they are well portioned. Not a bad spot to hit up if you're craving asian food in the MBay."}
{"text":"A solid Chinese restaurant in this area. I've gone here a couple of times with my girlfriend during their lunch special hours and we were not disappointed with the food. The soup was a little off one of the days, but otherwise it is very good (both eggflower, and hot&spicy). The portions are good, and the meat is not drowning in sauce and nicely presented - garnished with vegetables, with a dipping sauce on the side. A great value"}
{"text":"My coworkers usually drag me to eat at this place, and every time we came, the experience had always been great.  The place is small and kept well, the setting of the tables are strangely divided.  The service always been okay.  The waiter is super friendly and polite and very attentive.  The food is pretty decent, your typical Chinese American style food.  I enjoyed their Chicken Cream Corn Soup, their small bowl is actually big!! And I also order their Mongolian Beef.    Overall good place, with good fair prices...I wish I could come back in the future, but I just moved to a new office, and no where near this place."}
{"text":"This is a great locally owned business!  The service is always friendly and fast...the food is really good to..my wife and I travel over 10 miles to eat at our favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not to happy... Just really bad service and representation by the staff. Lack of knowledge by any degree. And asking to get something done different such as \"no spicy mayo\" holy cow did they get offended. And why we paid $36 for the four half orders of Maki Rolls. We should have been the offended.   We ordered two of the seven course tasting menus. $59.00 each I believed. It came with 3 salads. Two apps and two entrees. Which they Put all of each courses on a single plate. Now we didn't ask them to split each course per couple. (the four of us splitting) but combining the two on the same plate!?!? Lazy as hell!!!!!   The salads were all bland... potskickers were fantastic Dumplings were nothing remember-able  There \"lobster pancakes\" tasted nothin like lobster and had way to much mushroom.  Spicy shrimp entree was actually great. Good spice and flavor.... Roasted flank steak was ok........ Served with fried spinach. That was nice. Here is another rant.... We were offered a choce in the tasting menu with our entrees. Fried rice or wasabi mashed potatoes. We were never asked and of course got wasabi mashed potatoes. We asked for the side to be changed, it was and we were billed for it!!!!! nice!!!!"}
{"text":"Was here for my Bday dinner.  The staff was very attentive.The Kobe beef tartar was to DIE FOR, followed by seared Ahi and Korean Kalbi rib eye which were all so  scrumptious. Unfortunately,  our waiter did not warn us about the large size of the side dishes,  so we ordered additional sides which ended up getting wasted. But, all in all, this is a very modern restaurant, the lighting and the mood is very warm,  the food is top notch. I'll be back...like Aanold."}
{"text":"I liked it - food was tasty, service was great, ambiance was comfy and cool, nice wine selections. Try the wasabi mashed potatoes, kobe beef, and sashimi selections.  Great place to go with a group. Colleen www.newpointpr.com"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had been to their old incarnation at the Metro center some 10-15 years back, but never had a chance to come here. So, picked them for the Mother's Day dinner tonight.   We all enjoyed the food and a great customer service. They made special vegetarian food for us with no oyster sauce or chicken broth. Fried rice, veggie noodles, and Vegetable Tofu were  very fresh and tasty. The tropical punch I had also tasted yummy. Hisako, who attended was very courteous, friendly and patient.   We will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Yes well the reviews are inaccurate at best. Mongolian beef was 90% green onions. Sesame chicken was soured sesame oil and the beef and broccoli should have been broccoli with an oz of beef. The chow mein chicken was cooked in a burned wok because while it didn't look burnt it was burnt smelling and tasting. Tiny egg rolls and bottled sweet and sour goop. No option for low sodium soy sauce. Frozen peas and carrots added to white rice is not fried rice.  I wish I had something nice to say but I'm just hoping my family and I don't get sick. Really bad food and surprisingly good service. Abacus on 35th and Thunderbird is awesome and I should have driven the extra 10 min."}
{"text":"Two friends and I were staying at the Mandalay Bay casino and wandered in here for a late dinner.   At first we were miffed because the hostesses told us there would be a 10 minute wait and to get a drink at the bar...however tumbleweeds could have been blowing through and there was no need to wait.  We pondered what drinks to order and shortly after were seated anyway so we didn't even get to get a drink.  We also asked for a booth and were denied even though ALL of the booths were open and looked desperate for people to plop their weary asses down and relax.  Our server was very knowledgeable, you know the whole 'professional waiter' vibe and was able to tell us about the portion size and specials.  The cocktails were delicious.  I think I ordered a red dragon or something like that. A friend ordered the mojito, also tasty.  We did not try any sushi (something about fresh sushi in the desert skeeves me out even if they do fly it in daily...).  The Chinese dishes with a twist were interesting and flavorful.  We got the grilled szechuan beef and drunken chicken for entrees to split and for an appetizer ordered the spicy beef and scallion dumplings.  At first we figured we would still be hungry even though we wanted a light dinner but the portions were pleasantly filling.    If you're starving then order an appetizer and entree per person.  The plates are able to be shared but the portions are rather sparse (one per person).  It's a good place to start the evening and has a nice variety to the menu.  Overall a nice place and I like the open kitchen to see the staff hard at work!"}
{"text":"'We don't want your kind anyway' referring to my black friend, and that's enough for me never to go back! First, we went here for a quick lunch, ordered quickly, and sat. We waited for about thirty minutes before our soups arrived. Other tables around us, which had arrived later, had already been served and finishing their main courses. We should have figured something was amiss, so I flagged the waiter. He was dismissive, to my surprise. The elderly female supervisor that she wouldn't help and said the statement above. I asked for the owner. He came, was especially disinterested in the insulting remark we had been handed. To all this he said that we should leave, that it was obvious we weren't wanted there as patrons. I mean seriously! They couldn't have said it when we came in. Food looks decent, I guess; not sure why they changed their name from China Grill to Shanghai Grill."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to have a great atmosphere. Dark, perfect for a romantic date with your partner, not a first date. I see people giving it bad reviews for the fact that the sushi wasn't great, but really the place is called China Grill, what made you think that it is a good place to get sushi. That is like going to Pizza hut for a taco, doesn't make sense. Had a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees for under 80 bucks. Great deal."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional.  Food is decent, service good, they have alcohol and are open latter than most places in the area.  Big menu.  Good for a fast Chinese food snack."}
{"text":"So my family lives around the corner from here and frequently eats from a nearby Chinese restaurant, but thought we'd give this place a try based on the reviews.  The service was excellent.  They were polite and helped my wife out to the car since her hand was hurt.  That's pretty much the end of the positive experience.  I ordered the vegetable lo mein.  The noodles were very, very oily and it had a grand total of 5 vegetables other than loads of cabbage-3 pieces of broccoli, 1 green pepper, 1 snow pea.  Other than being very bland, the serving was rather small.  I'm not a big person, but had to reheat leftovers as there wasn't enough to feel full.  My wife ordered the Mu Shu Chicken.  The thin pancakes it's supposed to come with were thick tortillas.  She said the flavor was good, but didn't use the tortillas.  My son ordered the sweet and sour pork which was pretty good.    Overall, the portions are small, prices double what I could get nearby for more food and better flavor.  Tried it, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh pretty much describes my experience and their food.  Nothing bad, but nothing that stands out, either."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp with lobster sauce and it was amazing. The shrimp was prepared perfectly and the sauce wasn't overwhelming like other places make it. I don't even like Chinese food, but this place is very good!"}
{"text":"It's decent Chinese food, meant for sharing.  If you're in a party of 4 or more, then it's worth a visit.  My faves are the duck fried rice, the steak with massive thin onion rings on top and the short ribs.  They also do a great stir-fried asian vegetable [not bok choy, but some bitter leafy veg].  Service was friendly but it's a little too dark to read the menu in there."}
{"text":"They served store bought flour tortillas with the Moo-Shoo.  That doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Asian-fusion restaurant. I can't say its the best I've ever had, and you can certainly find much better restaurants in Las Vegas and specifically at Mandalay Bay but I definitely enjoyed my meal here. The actual restaurant is really cool - the decor is unique and beautiful - they have very cool lighting fixtures that give the atmosphere an industrial but romantic edge. The main dining area is domed with very cool blue lighting that gives a ripple and wave effect to the ceiling. I could stare up at it all night. The service here was also very good. Our waitress was helpful and gave great recomendations on food and wine options. I came here with a group - which was perfect as the portions here are meant for family style dining - and we had a really great meal. As appetizers we actually ordered a few of the side dishes: the avocado salad fried rice and the cripsy spinach (which I HIGHLY recommend). All our entrees were also very good: BBQ Salmon, the drunken chicken and the grilled szechaun beef. The desserts were also quite good - especially the trio of creme brulees. All in all, if you're looking for a moderately priced place to diner with a large group then this is a good option."}
{"text":"Ate at China Grill for our anniversary and it was amazing.  If you are not sure what to get I suggest the pre-fixe menu for $65 a person.  Well worth it and you get soooooo much food.  We ended up taking alot home with us.  The desert is the size of both of my hands together, and we couldn't finish it and it also came with another dessert we didn't even touch.  I would highly suggest this restaurant.  The service was outstanding and we had told the hostess it was our anniversary and she passed it along and the chef said happy anniversary and our server brought us champagne which was very nice :)  They explain every dish and tell you how to eat it and what it will be like :)  So enjoyable.  Overall the experience with the amazing food and great service is what made it for us.  I also used the restroom which was pretty entertaining as well since they have little tvs in each stall :)  I will def. go back!"}
{"text":"I have to say, my experience was different than several of the more recent reviewers. I had some family in town staying at the Four Seasons and we decided to head here for dinner for the large booths so my nieces could lay down if they got tired. The staff was beyond accommodating, even going next door for a peanut butter sandwich and chicken strips for my young nieces. I though the food was very good and the server was very knowledgeable and helpful in deciding what to order. I can't think of any way the experience could have been improved and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Would have been a four star review except for the waiter Arnold who seems to think high pressure waiting is acceptable. Even after we told him we were in a rush he kept us waiting for over fifteen minutes before asking if we wanted dessert. He was too busy chatting with co workers. AVOID!!"}
{"text":"No self-respecting Asian sushi lover would come back for their sushi.  The worst!    Went for their happy hour, got 4 small pieces of their version of spicy tuna and California rolls for $5 each. Ugh, it tasted old and I have no idea why they call it spicy tuna.  More like a failed deconstruction of what they think their midwest customers think should be in a sushi roll.  The drinks were overly sweet.  We had a running joke while we were in Vegas - \"but not as bad as CG Sushi\""}
{"text":"Was not sure after seeing the mixed reviews, but it is always good to make up your own mind. My GF and I went last night (Xmas eve) and the staff was amazing! They were all super friendly and accommodating. We got the Mongolian Beef and Volcano Chicken (both with Lo Mein noodles). Both dishes came out quickly and were delicious! The meats were tender and cooked just right, The veges were very fresh and not over cooked. with a bit of crunch   The table across from us had ordered the Sizzling Hot Beef Plate that was reviewed earlier. It might have been a dud that time, it was a winner this time. The metal plate was so hot you could smell the wooden holder underneath it (kind of like summer camp craft class). When the server put the beef on the hot plate, it was like a fourth of July Fajita! It sizzled like crazy and then went up in flames when the server poured the Ginger wine on it. Very impressive and the people said it was great.   We will deff go back for that and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband & I ordered the Happy Family (very good), House Chicken (simply deeeelish!) & Lo Mein (very good). Oh, and some Pot Stickers (pretty good). We liked it & think this is probably the best Chinese food we've found yet. No delivery charge - so we tipped the driver well. The food was hot & delivery time was faster than we were told - about 30 min instead of 45. We are definitely going to order from here again. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was tastey for sure, but i don't think the quality is worth the price.  Factoring in that everyone shares, you often aren't filled up for a $40 meal.    But the food is good, maybe this place is more suited for parties of 2-6 rather than 12."}
{"text":"After dozens of disappointing suggestions we finally found a really good Chinese restaurant in the valley. Since we left New York we have not found the real deal. China Grill has excellent egg rolls, fried rice, lo mein, and barbecue pork slices. We will be going back even though it's a long drive from Goodyear. Looking forward to trying new dishes each time."}
{"text":"Sushi happy hour is FANTASTIC! We had california roll, spicy tuna roll, pineapple roll and i think some kind of salmon roll. I also had some freshly brewed French roast coffee, SO GOOD.   The atmosphere is so relaxing and the decor very unique; we sat at one of the tables with two sofas. So comfortable without being sloppy. There's also a bar area and 2 TVs that was each playing different sports games. The staff were also very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Always a fan favorite.  Can be expensive at times, but the quality of the food is always perfect.  A great chain that I will repeat -- love crispy spinach"}
{"text":"They weren't serving dinner when I was ready to eat, so I just had the happy hour sushi. It was a bit too nouveau fusion for my taste. I just wanted normal sushi. I would try it again, but not for the sushi."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I pass by 5-6 other Chinese places to pick up food here. The lettuce wraps appetizers are terrific and every dinner I have had was also superb. The service and prices are both also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good, not great food.  Certainly didn't live up to the hype or price."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good. What happened? Four different types of chicken, also known as shoe leather. And to top that off, the owner did not come over, and, only took 10% off bill. Last time I checked that isn't a great way to treat customers. Almost forgot when a friend told waitress about chicken she said \"it's fresh, it was made this morning\"..ten hours later. Read the not recommended views. Gotta love how they pay to only show the good reviews. One meal, One customer, right?"}
{"text":"We went to China Grill last week and I was one of the only ones in our group that hasn't been to China Grill.   Our group ordered the crackling calamari salad, tempura tuna sashimi and spicy beef and scallion dumplings. I only ate the dumplings as I'm not a huge fan of calamari or tuna. The dumplings were OK. I've had better dumplings at other restaurants. However, I know the table absolutely loved the calamari salad and the sashimi. I also ordered the ginger mojito, which was delicious. The fresh ginger had a nice bite to it.   I ordered the half portion of sake marinated \"drunken\" chicken (ponzu sauce, sweet crispy onions and Asian slaw). My dish was incredible - the chicken was crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside and I devoured the crispy onions and the Asian slaw.   I sat next to someone who ordered the char siu baby back pork ribs (jicama-Napa cabbage slaw and apple crisps) and she was kind enough to share. The ribs were OK, but the slaw and apple crisps were amazing."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last visit - but the fact that I still remember a few things vividly from both visits after full weekend vegas work conference and fun is a sign that it's a really great place.  Atmosphere is beautiful, hip, cool, and high class. Service was excellent on both occasssions. We had a group of about 10 people both times and were taken very well care of. The few menu items I remember wanting more and more and more of was the lobster, a noodle dish and the flash fried spinach. You can't go wrong with pretty much anything though as everything I've tasted from here has been delish. I think it's best to come with a few people so you can order several plates and pass the around to share, that way you get to try a lot more, because honestly, everything is really good.Since was treated both times I can't comment on the price - but it's definitely not cheap so be prepared for an excellent experience, excellent food and to pay for them both.  And last comment, as with all hot spots in vegas, even their restrooms are really swanky. All individual rooms, very modern minimilastic vibe.  Definitely a go to spot!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation, we were running beyond late, we called down and when we got there they were very nice and accommodating and we only had to wait a few minutes for our table.  The food here is Chinese fusion-ish but family style. I have no complaints about the food or the portions. The dinning room is beautiful and very well decorated.  My ONLY complaint lies with the music.... why was it trance and why was it so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other? We had to eat in silence just bopping our heads to the \"unce-unce-diggi-dig-pew-pew\" beats..... not cool!!! I would have preferred been chit chatting it up with my girls!"}
{"text":"This place blows. Foods ok but service is terribly slow. Maybe I have just caught them on off days but I will go to Big Heng down the street from now on."}
{"text":"China Grill is a rather enjoyable place.  They have well styled decor and their meals are rather enjoyable if not spectacular.  One thing that is very important to do is remove the idea of chinese food from your head.  Most people have so many preconcieved notions that it will ruin the experience (and may make you confused when the bill arrives). I was pleased by the balance of their meals and they put great care into blending the tastes.   The straight-asian style modern cuisine What's good-decor, non \"chinese\" menu, fresh clean linen mmmm The slap-not really worth going out of your way for."}
