{"text":"I loved the pizza! The ranch sauce had an awesome homemade taste and Huge servings.  beer on tap was nice and cold. I was a little worried that this place might be like chain food so I played it safe and ordered there version of a supreme pizza. First the ingredients were awesome the cheese was nice and thick and the topping were fresh the pizza was exactly what I was looking for a stray from your normal pizza joint but not so crazy it was over whelming. I was excited they had beer I always order a beer on tap to start I expected it to be flat or warm but in came in a nice chilled class and had that full beer taste. The service was awesome Our sever was super attentive and had an awesome attitude. When you walk in the vibe feels a bit week because the floor plan is set up weird I never like staring at the kitchen when I walk in. I think if they added some music it might spice it up a bit. but I think that's just the way the place was built. All and all good experience and good pizza the supreme had. there spin on it and set it apart from your normal pizza. Prices were on point I got a huge pizza couple beers and soda for like 30 bucks and had plenty to take home and eat for the next couple of days."}
{"text":"Recently, I found this restaurant to be quite a family favorite. It combines helpful and courteous staff with awesome food! The pizza is quite wonderful, as it is thin, crispy and tasty. The cheese melts in your mouth and the chicken wings and chicken fingers are beyond delicious.

My favorite part is the homemade ranch that they are not stingy in providing to customers. It is delicious and worth traveling to get and enjoy.

This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Delicious menu, the pizza is brilliant, prices are very decent. When I have parties I always get my pizza from here. The people who work there have a really laid back atmosphere, but it doesn't make the experience unprofessional. This is also a great place for kids - every Wednesday they have a kids movie night where they can create their own pizzas while watching a movie! Definitely worth a try, delicious local place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and somewhat fast delivery."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. My kids and I loved to frequent the dine in restaurant. Tonight however we ordered delivery. My sister paid with her card, everything was good until the food actually got here and we didn't have the card here. The driver took the food back because without the imprint they can't deliver food. Even though the card had been charged, even though they would throw it away, they didn't have an imprint. 

I called the restaurant because the website does not say you have to provide the card, and when I called the card in they didn't tell me the policy. The manager at the time listened and apologized however it was a new policy and the owner would not be back until Friday. Today is Saturday. I offered to send him a photo of the card, I asked them to call the card owner and none of that would suffice. He did offer to send out new food as soon as the physical card would be presented, my sister could come there or just be at my house. Considering my sister was across town and it would be at least another hour for the food to be prepared and sent out, I didn't see the point. I have kids who's were ready to eat at that time and making them wait longer wasn't fair when we had other events planned for our Saturday sleepover. 

Having the food you paid for,  taken away in front of kids is not my idea of a good time. I can respect a policy but only if it's stated and told upfront. Had I known that I would have kept the card. Or at least would have paid with mine since we split the party supplies up. The whole thing just sucked. $30 bucks of food wasted. I hope someone enjoys what I bought because we won't."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the Westside of town.  Great for kids and families.  Try the zepollis as they are awesome.  Come almost every Wednesday with our daughter for movie night so she can make her own pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! Usually pick up...delivery tonight all went perfectly!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer at this villa for 8 years. We almost always order the same thing. Cooks have came and went but the pizza has always been great. The past two orders have been very disappointing. 

2 orders ago the pizza seemed not up to par but not terrible. We figured it was a fluke. 

Last night we ordered around 9pm, a little late. One pizza came fresh and hot but not tasty. The other pizza was clearly an old pizza. It was barely warm and the cheese and sausage was hard. There was no possible way that that pizza had been made fresh. 

This is very disappointing. We order on a weekly to
Bi-weekly basis, tip well and were very friendly. I don't know what's going on with them. I am very sad to lose them. I am a very loyal villa lover. Someone please notify me when it's better"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We typically go several times a month and not only is the food consistently good but the service is incredible.  Shelby has been our server several times and I must say she is one of the best servers we've ever had.  Each time we go in she remembers our order."}
{"text":"Things not the same here anymore.  I was told owner manager is in SanDiego, comes in once a week.  Well, I quess you can say when the cat is away the mice will play.  After ordering pizza here for years I have vowed to find a new place, there are many in the area.  I was promised a 45 minute delivery.  I called after one hour. Was told pizza will be there in five minutes. 20 plus minutes later pizza arrives, COLD as ice.. Called them back, tryed to blame me, said they could not enter my gate, then admitted they went to wrong plcace.  This is how a business goes bust, loss of one old customer at a time, who tells 10 others , I will not order here again and intend trying Metro Pizza who have very good reviews and management that has heard of customer service.  I really do feel sorry for the absentee owner she has no idea whats going on here I would quess."}
{"text":"Just one word-DISGUSTING
It used to be good, but now it's nothing but dried out and tasteless. I am a New Yorker, and although nothing comes close, there still is potential for pizza here if the cheese is suffice and it's not cooked to death. Didn't like it the last time I ordered neither but thought it was an off day but......nope that's their norm. Never again"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for great food, excellent service & awesome prices!  I heart old school pizza places, having grown up in Vegas its really nice to see places still in business for over 20+ years.  We had a great dinner at Villa last night.  We had an extra large cheese, side of wings w/ fries & some garlic knots.  Pizza & wings were absolutely delicious, garlic knots were good but drenched in a whole lot of butter/oil. Our bill came out to $37, including two drinks.  Good deal for great food!"}
{"text":"I've been to New York City and tried lots of the amazing pizza there... this one is up there with the big dogs! There are a few locations around Las Vegas, and every one I've been to is great. This location is just the closest to my house, so I'm there most often. Everyone that works here is so friendly, and I've never had a problem with my order EVER in years. 

Again, this is somewhere that I've been going to since I was a little kid. I'm praying they are still around by the time I have kids (in like 8 years)because this will be the only pizza place they will ever know. They can visit other places on their own and be traders, but if I ever find out they are disowned. Jk.

So I'm a simple kind of gal which makes my order a plain cheese pizza! The crush is perfect, not too crunch. The cheese and sauce are a perfect balance and one doesn't overwhelm the other. I AM A RANCH FEEN AND THEIR RANCH HERE IS LIKE LOVE IN A CUP. 

Also, the chicken wings... so good! They're teriyaki sauce is great, and is the only place I will eat teriyaki wings from. The mild sauce on the wings is good too. 

Price wise, it's a little bit more expensive than your avg Pizza Hut... but if course it is, it's made with love and tastes 10x better."}
{"text":"I just spent 15 minutes trying to remember my old yelp password just to write this review. Villa Pizza is without a doubt THE BEST PIZZA you can get in this town. Nothing I write will do this chill friendly joint justice. I bit into the plain cheese and went \"Oh, Hello pizza! Nice to meet you FOR THE FIRST TIME.\" I was back the very next day. I've been in Vegas for years, and frankly it puts every other pizza to shame. Great Customer Service. Great Value. Great simple well done pizza. Extraordinary."}
{"text":"This place is effin golden! The staff is very friendly. The food was orgasmic. One of my top list for pzza."}
{"text":"I've eaten at over 40 pizza places in town and i always come back to villas. 
Good friendly staff and the best pizza in Vegas.  This place has been my favorit pizza joint since i was 8.  Give it a try,you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had villa pizza before but not from this restaurant. They got to us fast but it wasn't very good. It was really bland and had no flavor.The cheese was sticking to the box in the corner. Won't order here again."}
{"text":"Very good prices on happy hr from 2to 5 everyday. The cheese pizza is soo good you will become a pizza lover , if you werent already and if you already are , it will delight your taste buds !! NEW YORK KNOWS HOW TO MAKE PIZZA. YUMMMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This by far is the best Pizza restaurant here in Las Vegas. I love this place. 
They are always friendly and the food is always great.

Thank you."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Villa Pizza for years.  A Jersey transplant and this Pizza is as close as I had find to the Jersey pies I'm used to. The wings are great and they have some great draft beers. I also love the garlic knots and zappolis."}
{"text":"Talk about GREAT pizza!  The Caesar salad was also great!  A must try is the Thai pizza and the Fawsome pizza...BOTH favorites :)"}
{"text":"We came here this past weekend and the food was GREAT. The garlic knots and the pizza were to die for and the prices were amazing. This is officially a must visit place whenever we are in town. The cook Ziggy is the best there is."}
{"text":"I love this place and I think mostly cause the staff is always so nice!!! The stromboli is so goooooood and the mini cannolis are so yummy. I'm from California, but visit often and this is my first go to spot."}
{"text":"Then  pizza is pretty good but there are too many pizza place that are better to give them 5 stars but I do like the Hawaiian pizza was good and the employees are nice."}
{"text":"I would love to give this more stars, the food is good but used to be great. Not sure if they changed owners or what the problem is but the last 3 times we ordered it was delivered and was not right. One night we had to call back 2 times as the calzone dough was raw. Each time they say \"would you like us to remake it\"...well um yeah that was our MEAL! Then they always want the wrong item back, kind of insulting like maybe we are lying to get free food. Not aware of any other delivery place that does this. Spoke with the mgr this time and he did remake it and said we could keep the mistake. At this point we probably won't order again, 3 strikes your out. Bummer because they do have good pizza. Also, seems like they don't care that they are losing a customer, must be nice to have so much business you don't care if you lose one!! Now the search is on for great pizza AND customer service!!"}
{"text":"Vegas for our anniversary ended up taking our kids to the Skate Park down the street from the Villa and decided to give it a try. This place was great my 6 yr old loves talking to everyone and the girls here were super nice. They even gave my kids crayons and drawings to color. The Pizza Bianca and Hawaiian pizza, Calamari and trio platter were Amazing. We also had the Mini Cannolis and they were bomb!! Will definitely be going back when we're back in Vegas."}
{"text":"We eat here often sometimes 2-3 x a week as I love the fingers but it's frustrating that when I order the big thing of ranch I never got it and I ordered 15 fingers fried zucchini sticks and a myo pizza and got 2 little ranch's I know my boys they and I like the ranch and I asked for more I then get charged for my ranch which I never have been last time we where here last week the same girl messed up the fingers and they had to redo them not sure if it the girl we get when the regular servers r not here but we might have to take a break from this place since the last few times it's been horrible 
Sad I am pregnant and I crave the ranch and fingers but I can't do the bad service"}
{"text":"There are few things as satisfying as getting what you want, and sometimes, you really want pizza and nothing else will hit the spot. The gooey cheese and crunchy, chewy crust paired with a hint of acidic tomato sauce? Damn. Anyway, I wanted pizza, bad, and the Yelp app turned me on to this spot.

Thankfully, they sell by the slice (even during dinner hours!), so I didn't inhale a whole pie- but I could have. Added pepperoni and mushroom to my slice, sprinkled on a dusting of garlic powder and parm, and got down to business. It was so freaking good I had to make myself leave before I ordered another. And now I have difficulty shopping in the area without making a stop!

Other cool stuff: they have daily lunch/dinner specials and Wednesday is kid's night, where they can come in to watch a movie at 6PM and make their own pizzas for like $6. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Groupon was what motivated us to check out this place.  We were pleasently surprised how good the food was.  My husband got pizza and I got the Penne ala Vodka.  They also gave us a complimentary sample of their Brucshetta which was AMAZING.  Their pizza is good (snuck a bite from my husband).  The pasta was fantastic...could immediately tell it was home made sauce, which was an added bonus.  Reasonably priced, and nice environment for families."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pizza places here in the Valley. Dom DeMarco's, Metro Pizza, Secret Pizza... The list just keeps freakin' going. Of all of them, though, Villa Pizza is the one me and my friends return to every single time. Let's break it down.

First and foremost, the food's just consistently GOOD. I love the pizza, the wings, the fries, the pasta dishes, the garlic knots, the meatball sliders... the list just goes on. Point being - I've tried a lot of what they have on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed to any degree. What really sets it over the edge, though, are the prices. Lordy, any time I'm able to feed myself and two friends for less than $30, I'm just thrilled. They've also got specials galore for dine-in orders - highly recommend you check them out!

Finally, I have to give a shout out to the wonderful staff. They're always friendly, helpful, and just great at what they do overall. Service with a smile, and they're more than accommodating for whatever request we ever have. I also just appreciate everything they do as a team to give back to the community, including their kids' movie nights (Wednesdays at 6 PM) and their support for the #VEGASSTRONG movement. 

Overall, this place gets my seal of approval to just about everybody I know, and to everyone reading this review."}
{"text":"This place has always had consistently good food and service. Anything on the menu has been fabulous! We really liked it when it was on Vegas Drive & Rainbow Blvd., much closer to our house!! However, we will go wherever the restaurant is located!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 14\" veggie with pepperoni for take out along with garlic knots and a brownie.  The brownie was great, the garlic knots were made in the style of cinnamon roles but tasted fine and the pizza was limp and soggy through the center so about 1/2 the pizza was a pizza flavored mess.

When we called to provide feedback, our first response was \"thanks for the feedback, we'll try to do better next time.\"  We called again to speak to a manager and were told we'd make you a new one, but it's closing time so we'll give you 20% off your next purchase.  Problem is, there won't be a next purchase based on the service we received tonight."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed and unhappy with Villa, second time in a month they have given us the wrong order. We placed our order online then recieved a call from a Villa employee, she clarified what we wanted. We told her to pay special attention to our wing request because our order was wrong last time so please make sure correct...you reference it was wrong again. We also ordered a meatball sub online, listed under hot subs pretty clear cut...the employee verified we ordered a meatball parmigiano,  exactly what we ordered under subs, but what arrives is meatballs in a dish with red sauce and cheese. Don't worry folks she is new so that eliminates her from having any responsibility, or at least that is according to the manager who we spoke to over the phone. Manager clarified that if we are unhappy even though we just had them deliver the food we could personlly bring back our uneaten food to show her that it was wrong and THEN she can do something about it...an extremely generous offer but we already waited the typical 45+ minute wait for delivery on a Friday night so surprisingly our children were ready to eat whatever food arrived despite it being incorrect. Confused about why we should need to prove what we ordered was wrong? Thanks for being so disrespectful and uncaring to your \"valued\" customers Villa. I think we will take our business elsewhere in the future and no it is not because you delivered food wrong it is because you don't care that is happened!!!!! No room for improvement if you are not willing to listen."}
{"text":"Good place to take your kids to eat pizza, they love the fact they have board games available while they wait for their pizza. Wings are good to and their customer service is nice."}
{"text":"Their meat sauce and the bread on chicken parm sando was to die for! It made the sando! They could go a little easier on the cheese to just have it melt bettter. However, the breaded chicken cutlet was flavorful and crispy! We're still waiting on the rest of the order, but if its anything like this sando we're going to be stuffing ourselves to the brim with delicious food."}
{"text":"Walked in and appeared busy, alot of carry out customers. Nice atmosphere a couple of televisions with sports I'm starting to like this place. It's a sit yourself place gal-kind of cute came from behind counter and took drink order. 

We ordered a Hawaiian style pizza and a side of mozzarella sticks. Mozzarella sticks came and i broke 1 in half for my son to cool it off. Figured they'd be hot, nope. Which is good cause you dont want to burn a child. They taste okay.  I taste more of the breading than cheese. 

Pizza came out and it's been a long time since i tasted a fresh AND hot pizza. Pizza wasn't too bad. We enjoyed it. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We live on the other side of town. My son and I were craving pizza so we jumped in the car and made the 30 min drive here. Great pizza, good service, worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great zappolis ! Great pizza ! Great wings ! For a great price ! Definitely recommend ! Great staff too !"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my coworker. He was bragging about their meatballs/meatball sandwich and that got my attention real quick. I'll never pass up an opportunity to have a meatball sammy!

Meatball Sandwich: I would say about a 9\" sub with 4 decent sized meatballs, some red sauce, parm and some herbs sprinkled on top. The bread was soft, meatballs tasty and their sauce was great. One of the better meatball subs I've had in a while.. 

Slice of Cheese Pizza: One of the lightest and flavorless pizzas I've ever had. The dough was airy, had a thin crust, slightly crisped on the bottom, barely any sauce and cheese was quite bland. It wasn't horrible but it felt like it was missing something?.... Maybe more sauce, something in the dough.. They had oregano, parm, red pepper flakes and garlic powder as condiments.. Just pile it on and it'll help accentuate some flavor..

Staff was cool, meatball sandwich was great and overall kinda pricey.."}
{"text":"This place usually has pretty good pizza but the last few times that I ordered  from here, my pizza has been soggy.  Soggy pizza is wah wah."}
{"text":"Great wings n fingers one of favorites in town! Pizza is good and they definitely have my favorite ranch dipping sauce ever!"}
{"text":"For thin pizza with no frills this is the place. We live far from this location, but still feel it's worth the drive. Usually just order a cheese pizza--the pepperoni tends to make the pizza too greasy, and the awesome chicken fingers-the best fingers ever. And you can not forget or miss out on their homemade ranch dressing--it's so good--on everything! We once ordered onions on the pizza but they were caramelized and it's not what I was expecting. Villa is a Vegas staple; I know people who were eating there in the 70's! Not cheap, so if you're looking for a cheapo pizza, look elsewhere, Overall it's good and the place itself is a bit run down with some dramatic murals painted on the wall--vintage italiano! Lots of family orientated events and good eat-in specials. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good! Delicious New York style pizza at affordable prices located on Durango and Spring Mountain. Oh yeah, they have beer in tap. Perfect combo"}
{"text":"I have been a client of their for years however recently in the last year or so the food has been terrible, you order take out they always forget items, so this last visit I actually went in to pick up my order and got home and still items were missing...I called to tell them the order was messed up and the girl on the other end wanted to argue with me that it was in the bag...HUM really I emptied the bag and there was nothing else in it!  Also never realized how horrible the place looked on the inside the furniture is like a yard sale married a junk yard and had a baby....this will be my last visit for either take out or pick up!!!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place has so many good reviews says something about the pallet of the pizza eaters in las vegas.  The sauce is overly sweet, the crust is soggy and tasteless and the pizza wasn't cooked long enough so the green peppers and onions still tasted raw."}
{"text":"after all these years, still the best pizza in vegas! order a large cheese pizza, side of wings, maybe some garlic knots, and you are set!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is soooo good and the garlic knots are amazing. The $6.49 all-you-can-eat deal is my new favorite lunch special. Even the salad was so good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ive had Villa Pizza on numerous occasions and always found it lacking flavor and spices in its pizza.

These review though is not for their pizza, its for their wings.

Ordered their 20 piece wings (with ranch), a side of fries and the chicken fingers (which came with fries). I thought it was a little pricey. Came to 29.83 I would expect it to be a couple dollars cheaper but i figured what the hell. It was a late sunday night and I had no other choices. Everywhere else was closed.

The gentlemen was nice on the phone, explained all the different options and prices with each. Took only a couple minutes and told me my food would be delivered in 40 minutes.

Low and behold it was here in 35 minutes. Thats good. I like them to be on time or early. The fries were very good, not greasy or soggy. Only thing I would say is next time I wish they would lightly salt them. I had to brush off some of the salt after a while.

The wings were the best wings Ive had in a while and I usually have wings about once or twice a month. They were cooked perfectly. Had a slight crunch yet were very tender. They had lots of wing sauce and it was delicious. 

I had mild and my husband had the hot.

I'm going to get the restaurant.com and come here again. I love specials!"}
{"text":"I give two stars for the quality of the food which was great. However, no matter how great the food is, I still believe customer service is much more important. I stopped by here today around 4:30, and our server was rude. First I place my order, (which I had asked for their biggest ranch) then she just brings the two pizzas I ordered but not the ranch and I have to repeat myself after she had read it back to me several times. My younger brother had asked if they had a topping which she rudely and sternly says \"No.\" then, we need refills for about ten minutes, which she doesn't even come by to ask how the food is or anything, or to check up on our drinks, so my brother goes and asks for our refills up at the front. The person who got our refills wasn't even our server. Then when we went to pay, she saw I didn't tip her on the check and throws my card at me and the receipts and rudely says \"SIGN.\" It's funny to me that people expect a tip for coming to work when they can't even do their job efficiently, and then have someone else do it for them."}
{"text":"I love villa pizza! The best pizza and fries and ranch ever. The service is awesome and friendly for any age. I recommend to anyone I can!"}
{"text":"1st time. Our server was Heather and she was awesome!  Great pizza! Quality products and great menu! We'll b back for the pasta and calzones soon!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza but the hot wings are to die for! Not for the weak at heart.  Service could use some work."}
{"text":"Wrong pizza, wrong size.... 40 Minutes late and at room temperature. If you are going to charge almost $30 for a pizza, it better be on point. Called the  manager, she said if you don't like it don't eat it and bring it back tomorrow for a refund. Are you  kidding me,  how about credit me back 50% immediately ?"}
{"text":"If you're ever look for a mom and pizza place. This is the spot for you big time. Great food and great price also! Great Happy Hour deals on pizza, wings and chicken fingers too. A must try is their meat sauce. It comes with the Stromboli or garlic bread with cheese. Listen either way you won't be disappointed at all. And the two slice combo special is the best go to EVER!"}
{"text":"The food was sooo good.. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, great staff and can't beat the price. My family and I enjoy movie night on Wednesdays ..we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I am so bummed to be writing a mediocre review for this Villa Pizza. Whenever I used to get pizza, this would be the place to go, but how the mighty have fallen. I recall about 6 months ago, we came in late one night and we ordered an XL pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. Typically, the larger the pizza, the greater the chance that the pizza will be soggy in the middle, but this XL (I think it was 18\") was super crispy everywhere! 

Fast forward to about 3 months ago and we had another Villa craving. We called in ordering a large supreme. When we got home, it was such a sloppy mess. EVERYTHING slid off before we could take any bites 
because the slice was a 90 degree angle pointing down.  

Now last week, there was a Groupon for Villa and I jumped right on that train because I had assumed that the poor experience previously was merely because we had ordered too many toppings. We came at 6PM on Tuesday for our pizza feast. I have been coming to this Villa Pizza for 6 years now and I have never seen this place so packed. The Groupon definitely did its job, but they were unprepared and understaffed; the waitress even told us so. There was one girl doing all 10 tables and we had to ask for everything about 2 or 3 times (water, ranch, napkins, more water). 

We ordered their sampler which had fries, wings, chicken tenders, and mozzarella sticks. This was pretty good and the kids really enjoyed it (what kid doesn't love fried stuff?). However, when our pizza came out with our measly two toppings, the pizza was soggy in the center, AGAIN. I cannot get over the soggy center of a pizza since there are so many places that can make it better, so unfortunately, I will probably give them one more try, but if they fail again, I will have to seek new refuge for my NY style pizza cravings."}
{"text":"there corporate had a free slice of pizza day today and this location would not honor it telling us they do events like that. well hello corporate is ur boss so yes u do do events like that. thry just lost me as a customer n ive been eating there food for over 12 years since i was a teen but no more. good job."}
{"text":"We ordered here frequently sometimes 2-3 times monthly... and placed a nearly $60 order today as well through doordash. About 10 minutes later we get a doordash text notifying us the restaurant cancelled our order due to being \"busier than expected\".... no call from the restaurant to explain before hand, no call to apologize or ask if we preferred to wait  (which we would of gladly as we were not rushed for dinner) they just canceled it through the doordash.

I'm glad our $60 order wasn't worth decent customer service. We liked the pizza but we will no longer be spending our money here."}
{"text":"My son literally only eats their cheese pizzas. I am a fan as well, they always make the best strombollis or calzones. All their pizza toppings are delicious! Give em a try. If you like real fresh though and you want to eat at home you may want to order 10 minutes prior to arriving and take it home. I use delivery for last option just because of the price you pay for pizza these days. Good customer service for the most part. 
Just recently took the kid here on wednesday for make your own pizza day and movie day as well. They have a big screen there for kids to watch top movies such as Bed Time Stories, Coraline, and Shrek. My son will be treated to this day once again and it's totally worth the money!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in town and it's right down the street! Authentic taste! Delicious flavors! Want good pizza and a good family environment, come check these guys out!"}
{"text":"Awesome family friendly pizza spot!  Great customer service!  And the pizza is one of the best I've ever had!  The salad is fresh and cold which is perfect for Vegas!  Well done Villa Pizza!!  We'll definitely be back again & again & again & again...."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going into Villa Pizza on Durango when I was in town with my softball league. It was such a great experience that my wife & I created our yelp account JUST to tell everyone how awesome it is! Not only was the food amazing.. the service was great too! We had a our entire team (and spouses) in there & showed up without any notice & they were able to set something up for us right away (even with a busy dining room!) Heather was our server & she somehow memorized EVERYONES order without writing a single thing down, which impressed everyone.. Especially when everything came out ridiculously fast & PERFECT! The food was hot & family style sizes so I was able to try a little bit of everything & can honestly say I liked every single item I tried. Oh, and they kept us all happy with pitchers of beer flowing! It's nice to be treated like family & get awesome homemade food when you're traveling. Thank you Heather & the Villa crew. You guys nailed it. See you next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boyfriend who is a pizza lover! It is delicious italian pizza every time. Hot and fresh. The waiting staff is friendly and attentive. The place is clean and perfect for a quick lunch. I love that they offer beer as well! Nothing like a cold brew with your hot pizza on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fantastic service, great pizza, great pasta, you just can't go wrong here at all!

My girlfriend and I have a blast eating here and playing all the old school board games/Disney trivia cards. Makes waiting for the food feel like nothing and it's always a great time."}
{"text":"Pizza here is great! The wings are spicy and delicious! This is our go to for pizza! I usally get pepperoni and cheese. Never eaten at the location and pizza is ually delivered in a timely matter. I recommend this place to our friebds in the area."}
{"text":"My first time here I just happened to stumble by because my kids wanted pizza late at night. I ordered a 16inch and the hot fingers basket boy was both delicious !!! The service is always good and helpful and they even have a movie night for kids where they allow the kids to make their own pizza (how cool is that). Tonight I order delivery for two large pizza's and wings can't wait until it gets here so I can feed my craving me and my baby will be grubbing tonight. Lol oh yeah if you order over $20 you get a free soda and over $40 free salad or two other options !!!"}
{"text":"Basic tables and 2 televisions. Nice waitresses and above average food. Their sauce is pretty good but their egglant, meatballs and garlic bread is great! I'll be back."}
{"text":"A frequent lunch spot for myself and my colleagues, this place rarely disappoints. Their all-you-can-eat lunch special which runs from Monday to Friday is a staple for my office. Cough up $7 and you get an endless supply of pasta with marinara or meat sauce, cheese pizza, caesar or house salad, and garlic knots (drink not included). The pasta and sauce is mediocre and the cook has a bad habit of not draining all the water out of the dish so you're left with a small puddle of it at the bottom of your bowl. The pizza on the other hand is typically great and reminds me very much of the pizza I used to enjoy back in New York. The service is good and the interior is painted beautifully with Italian style murals including one of that dump they call Yankee Stadium."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Right about of Ingredients! I had delivery and food was delivered Hot!
Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I called in my order for pickup because they stop accepting online orders an hour before closing. The guy that took my order was polite and helped me out with my questions. They have a great selection of white pizzas. I tried the pomodoro and added mushrooms.  Normally I only eat thin crust pizza, but I decided to try the regular after seeing the yelp photos.  I was glad I did. It was quite tasty. The toppings were generous and I was overall very pleased.  The next time I order I will request the crust to be cooked a little longer than normal (they show you that option with online ordering) because I like a very crispy crust."}
{"text":"Villa Pizza is my favorite pizza! I have been going here for about 5 years and it's the best. Their pizza sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and salty, and the crust is great. I also really love their zucchini sticks, they're nice and crunchy. 

The staff is great too! They're very attentive and friendly. I actually went here last night to pick up dinner and somehow the ticket didn't pop up for the cook so my pizza wasn't made. The staff upgraded my pizza to a large and gave me a huge bag of fresh zeppoles(?) for free! 

The atmosphere is very laid back. You come in and seat yourself, and a waiter/waitress will be right there to get your drinks. It's the perfect spot for large groups. It's also a perfect place for kids as they have a movie night every Wednesday where they play kids' movies and let them make their own pizzas.

If you haven't tried Villa, you definitely should :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a Large Villa Special (Delivery)
It was soggy in the middle & the bottom side of it as pure flour.
I don't think I'll be ordering from here again. (Oh yeah, the driver got lost & I might as well have picked it up myself)"}
{"text":"We ate their Saturday at 830  ordered slice of cheese pizza and chicken fingers chicken fingers and fries were great , But cheese pizza was  not as good as it usually is it barely had cheese tasted more like just tomato sauce pizza that was just reheated  left over I told the server about it  I told her didn't taste like cheese pizza barely had. Any cheese and I asked her is this the cheese pizza the same one we usually order she said yes I said it doesn't taste the same she said oh , didn't offer to make a fresh one  sometimes it's really good I think it just depends on the cook back their I did not enjoy it at all and server didn't care  but she sure took her tip"}
{"text":"Hot pizza, crispy wings, always fast service! We come here at least once a week. They have gotten to know our names, I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food/pizza is delicious, but I can only give this place 2 stars because of the horrible service and attitude of the blonde female working there.  

Not once, not twice but three times on three DIFFERENT occasions she has been completely out of line.  First was after dining in with my family I asked for a cup to put my son's drink in to go and she told me, with an attitude, that she wasn't allowed to give me a cup.  
Second was when I went to dine in with a friend who just moved here from New York.  We're both from New York and I wanted to let her know that I found a decent pizzeria out here.  After we ordered a bunch of food, we realized that we ordered with our eyes.  I was already full and more food was still coming out from the kitchen!  No big deal, right?  You can just ask for boxes to box up your ALREADY PAID FOR FOOD!!!  Nope!!!! It's not like I'm trying to be greedy and ask for a box at an all-you-can-eat buffet after piling my plate with a ton of food!  I paid for every last thing I wanted to box up and take home!  When I asked for a box... she told me that she is not able to give me one because that's how they keep their prices so low!!!  Which aren't that low, by the way!!  
Thirdly and lastly... I was there today with my husband and son, again, dining in.  Since my son had just finished up his soccer game and it was dinner time for the 3 of us, I wanted to order quickly and ordered without looking at the menu knowing that we wanted to keep it simple to pizza and mozzarella sticks. When the mozzarella sticks came, it came with ranch dressing instead of marinara sauce.  When I asked NICELY to please have marinara sauce, she replied \"mmm hmm!\"  When she came back with the marinara sauce, she said, \"next time you order mozzarella sticks and want marinara sauce instead, can you please let us know so we don't waste our ranch dressing!\"  I let it go by saying, \"no problem!\"  But it was a problem... I was livid!!  I didn't want to have a confrontation with her, let alone in front of my son, but I am very mad for allowing her to get away with speaking to me like that, not once but 3 times!  
I lost my appetite and wanted to leave immediately!  My husband even joked, \"oh no, now you're going to have to ask her for boxes.\"  And I said, if she gives me a problem with that, then I'm absolutely opening my mouth!  Luckily for her, there was another very nice brunette female behind the counter who answered instead of her and said no problem and went and got me a box for my entire order of unfinished food.  
I also wanted to let her know that this pizzeria that she works in claims to sell New York style pizza.... even having Times Square painted all over the walls.  Now, I'm from New York... Brooklyn, New York... only having moved out here from Brooklyn 8 months ago!  Never have I EVER went into a pizzeria in Brooklyn, The Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island or Queens that served ranch dressing with their mozzarella sticks!  I shouldn't have to ask for marinara sauce.  It should be automatic!  Never eating there again because of the service from that one female!"}
{"text":"Absolute best cheese pizza anywhere in Las Vegas. Great atmosphere. Superb service. We also just tried the garlic knots for the first time and they were spectacular. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've had their food many times but have always had it to go. This time, we ate inside and it was a treat. Quick service, very friendly staff. I had the chicken finger sub, a nice sized fresh 10 inch roll, three large fingers, medium sauced, with lettuce, tomato and blue cheese (my choice) it was very tasty. My wife got the pizza slice, salad and drink special. One slice of this pizza is pretty large too. Decent salad with greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and pepperoncini peppers and some roasted red peppers. Not bad. Good deal for the money too."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in vegas. Been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed! Always fresh and customer service is amazing. Sometimes come a couple times in a week because it's just that good"}
{"text":"So I don't know why it has taken me so long to order from this place because holy pickles this place is the bees knees!! I had initially tried putting in an order somewhere else but found that they don't accept cash. All I had were hundreds and I was craving a chicken sandwich like crazy! I googled and found this place and called them to order the fried chicken sandwich and the hot wings with fries. Everyone I spoke to was soooooo nice!!! And when my food got here it was so bomb! The fries were even still crispy!! I will definitely be ordering again in the future. Everything was sooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy even after they tried to cook it more.
Quite a let down.
Ugly old & grimy.
Pizza is my favorite food.  If it is yours also, don't waste your time or $.
salad was average ..if even.
Corona in a bottle was great."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this Villa pizza for years! Do not let the Food court name fool you. Their pizza, Knots, bosco sticks, and pastas are all amazing. the service is always awesome, they even host a movie night for kids were they can also make their own pizza table side. I have them on Facebook as a friend were they alway post daily deals! Life long customer they've made me, and i cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"We went in for kids night on a Wednesday. They show a movie and have a \"kids build their own pizza\" for $7.99. They also get ice cream. This was so great! We got there in the nick of time and got a table. It was packed moments later. They projected a movie on a big screen which was excellent for the kids. They brought them out par-baked crust and let them build their own pizzas.  They had a blast. 
Adults ordered Caesar salad, wings and the white eggplant pizza. Salad was yummy. The wings were soggy. Needed to be crispier. Pizza had zero flavor whatsoever. It was described as white pizza with eggplant and roasted tomato. This was dry and the slices of almost raw tomatoes on top were not the roasted tomatoes o envisioned. So disappointing. It needed garlic, oil, herbs...something!! Even the standard kids pizza was like cardboard. Crust was not good. 
Beers were cheap, and the service was super friendly. Love the movie, array of board games, chill atmosphere and idea of kids night but the food needs work! Honestly, I would return for kids night because it was a fun thing to do. I hope it was a fluke and the pizza will be better."}
{"text":"Villa Pizza is one inviting place for the family. Other than delicious pizza and italian food, children can play table games with friends, family or parents. Amazing atmosphere !"}
{"text":"This is a really good place. 

The owner is there hand making each pizza. The dough is fresh, and then rolled out, not frozen. He is very generous with the cheese and the toppings. The Pizza is baked in an old fashioned pizza oven.

The staff is very courteous and friendly.

I took out a three topping pizza, and the toppings smothered the cheese. 

The large fed five hungry men, and none were looking beyond that second piece of pizza.

The only reason I can't do five stars is because it was pricey, $20 for a large 3 topping, and it had that \"greasy\" taste on the crust.

Overall, this is much better than Grimaldi's and Settebello's, and a much better value, even though I think it is pricey (compared with Costco). It is a family place, and I don't reccomend it to impress on a date. 

When Costco is closed, and you are having the gang over at the house, this is a can't miss Pizza."}
{"text":"$70 for two large pizzas and wings is nuts, no drinks, and we picked it up no delivery! asked for mild buffalo wings all that means is they are stingy on the buffalo sauce. If you ask for chicken and garlic pizza don't expect white sauce they make it with red sauce yuck!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way out of Las Vegas. I personally wasn't expecting much other than to satisfy my craving for pizza by the slice. We were pretty surprised and left with full bellies.

Food: I ordered a caesar salad and a slice of pepperoni pizza while my boyfriend got the steamed mussels in a tomato sauce with bread. He loved the mussels and claims they are the best ones he's eaten in a long time. My salad was good--hard to get salad wrong--but I thought the pizza was lacking in flavor, which I think may have come from the cheese. It's a shame but I suppose there has to be some flaw. 4/5.

Service: Overall, nothing to complain about. We were greeted immediately and our waitress was attentive. Our food arrived quickly and we were never left hanging. 5/5.

Ambience: This had a typical pizza bar atmosphere with casual seating and TVs tuned to sports channels. The restaurant and bathrooms showed signs of wear but were certainly clean. 5/5."}
{"text":"This is our once a week family spot! Great value and good food. A must is the family special! It's a special that runs all the time."}
{"text":"Terrible place!! Rude as soon as you walk in!!  Way over priced! Not worth the gas to get there!"}
{"text":"Villa Pizza Durango is the best Italian restaurant. I go for the service and stay for the food. If you love authentic New York pizza and great customer service visit Villa. My favorite is a fresh garden salad with a slice of sausage pizza."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. A. Freaking. Gold. Mine. 

Now that that's out of the way, the food! You know it has to be good when there are folks sitting outside in their cars eating a slice (which is exactly what I did when I got mines). I ordered a margherita pizza - large 17.99- and a 6 pack of Sierra mist. Pizza was, in a word, amazing. What do they put in the crust?! Like little breaded angels with wings made of pizza sauce that make the most satisfying crunch when you bite into them. Okay, that got a little weird. But, I digress, the pizza was probably the best I have ever eaten and I've been looking for some good pizza for the full 4 years I have lived here and this little gem was right around the corner? Shame on me! Took them about 15 mins to get my order ready and I opted for pick up instead of delivery.

Please eat this pizza. Tell your friends to eat this pizza. Tell them to tell their friends to eat this pizza."}
{"text":"Meh exactly.  Wings were anemic and the stromboli was uber greasy."}
{"text":"This is the pizza that reminds me of home, Brooklyn, NY.  The chicken fingers are the best!"}
{"text":"It was my first time I'm to the restaurant found on a near by google search. Upon entering we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. The atmosphere is very homey and fun. Paintings of New York on the walls and even a shelf with board games in the back, which I loved. Our food came out in decent time. The bread was fantastic it is homemade and delicious. I ordered the linguine with clam sauce, the sauce was a little to watery for my liking but with the addition of some of the homemade Alfredo it was just right. Our waitress Maddie was awesome super friendly and personable and answered all my crazy questions. I would defiantly recommend this great little spot. Best Italian I have had on Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have gone here many times and it's normally great but tonight it was horrible, the pizza was slimed and the wings had bone shards in them. Very dissatisfied and contemplating not ever going back. Waste of 50 dollars!"}
{"text":"Pizza was yummy and tasty.  4 stars versus 5 just based on personal pizza preference."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were great! Margarita pizza and pepperoni to be specific! Service was very attentive, nice & food came out very fast and hot! got free dessert too :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza I've tried in Vegas. Wings are great too. Definitely recommend trying"}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant and ate a super delicious meal!  I had Linguine with White Clam Sauce and hubby had the Penne ala Vodka and added 2 Meatballs.  We added Garlic Bread instead of plain bread and meals come with a beautiful salad which we dressed with Villa's homemade Ranch Dressing.  Weve been eating at the various Villa locations for years, but the food quality and such friendly staff (not to mention awesome service) make this \"The Villa Pizza\"!  Thanks so much for keeping the same great recipes!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile and now I know why. Ordered a cheese pizza to go. It wasn't busy at all. The cashier had trouble working the register. Took my order a second time on a different register.  Got it home and the crust was thick and underc. Called them and was told to bring the pizza back tomorrow and see the manager. I just ended up just throwing it away. Won't  be back."}
{"text":"OK so I hate being a downer but I am pissed.  We order takeout from Villa 3-4 times a month if not more.  Today the hubs and I called for delivery at around 11:30.  We were told that delivery wouldn't be until after 1:00pm.  So rather that wait I said we'd get off our lazy butts and come pick it up ourselves.  

Our order was simple.  One large cheese pie and 2 chicken ceasar salads.  I asked for the chicken on the side as we were eating those salads for dinner.  Ashley kindly told me that's how it's always prepared (on the side)!  Fast forward to 12:15 when my loving husband goes in to pick up our food.  Guess what?  Hot chicken is on the salad, not the side.  As he was unwilling to wait for them to redo their mess up he took the order and we came home.  Since I don't want wilted lettuce for dinner I decided to take the chicken off myself.  To my dismay they didn't even put a whole f'n chicken breast on the salads!  It was a few pieces.  Now I'm really pissed!  These salads here are not cheap at $10 for lettuce, chicken and dressing.

If this was the first time or maybe the second or third time I've had an issue I would look the other way.  The food here is awesome but their staff continually makes mistakes.  The last issue we had was where they delivered our order to the wrong address.  We discussed the proper address 2 times and they still got it wrong.  So our food arrived on the cool side.  It's sad because me as a customer gets no satisfaction at their continued mistakes.  I could go on and tell you about the time we didn't get our salad dressings or the time they put our side of meatballs in with my moms order of chicken parm plate, yeah all together as one meal.  WTH? Its crap there is no consistency! And what's worse is we are expected to tip.  I'm no a-hole but it's disgusting to tip and not get what is expected.  Sadly Villa is one of a handful of decent pizza places in our area.  As I said, the food is good just don't have high expectations on getting what you want. 

This all may sound like it's not a big deal but when you are paying good money you expect proper service and accuracy.  Their job is to fulfill my order.  Nothing more, nothing less. Food gets a 5 but service gets a 2 if not less."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years, and love this place!  Really good pizza, way better than some of the chain and higher end pizza places out there.  We also like going to the actual restaurant - we've done plenty of take out from here, but now with a LO, we like finding kid friendly places, and they are really kid friendly!  

Our latest visit was the other night - after we visited the Opportunity Village Halloween town.  Great choice!  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and the fries with cheese - both were a big hit with our LO.  

In the past, we've gotten pizzas with ham, sausage, olives, mushrooms - all are really good toppings.  The crust is really great, and they usually don't burn it - it's a rarity when that happens.  We've also gotten the garlic knots in the past - which are awesome!  Service is always pretty good - if you're doing pickup though after normal work hours (5-6pmish), you might be waiting a bit cause they get super busy with people calling in orders, picking up orders, etc.

Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good pizza!"}
{"text":"Really great specials all day long and they have a happy hour at 2pm . Great quiet settings to have a nice gathering . They also offer a kids movie night on Wednesday at 6pm . Located in the oreillys parking lot ."}
{"text":"Should have wrote this review a while ago but, better late then never ! Villa never disappoints . Most of the time I get delivery, everything is always great and pizza comes at the time they say. At home everyone loves the pizza and at my work place as well! Some of the best wings Iv had. Must try."}
{"text":"If you come into villa make sure to ask for Maddie as your surver, shes pretty cool and a great personality. Love the atmosphere and all the food"}
{"text":"Awesome food (if you're looking for something greasy), and service. Super affordable, and quick.  They have a bunch of family nights (kids specials, and kids movies), half a million specials, and beer!  The only downside is the hideous decor.  This place is muraled out in badly painted scenes of...bridges, flowers, and...baseball fields.  If you can get past the eye-gouging scenes of the old country, you'll probably really enjoy this place. 

PS- Try the antipasto salad! It's delicious with ranch too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas! Their lunch specials are amazing and worth every penny. Thin, New York style pizza. They have great happy hour specials too! Definitely recommend the cheese slices, kiddo loves the pepperoni! Their chicken fingers are awesome too! On Wednesdays they have a great kids make their own pizza & movie night! Great sit down pizza parlor on Durango, right across from Desert Breeze soccer complex. We haven't tried delivery because they're so close to the house. Heather was super friendly and attentive considering we hit their lunch rush. We'll continue to frequent this amazing Vegas staple!"}
{"text":"Just got a raw gluten free pizza. I was told to bring it back tomorrow for a full refund, but what do I do for dinner tonight?"}
{"text":"This is how my margarita pizza (with pineapple) came. It was so beyond SOGGY I didn't finish it. Every single thing slid right off the pizza when I picked it up to eat. So disappointed. I use to love ordering from here but now I know why I stopped. Save the money and go somewhere better, trust me."}
{"text":"Very good place. We got a meatball sub, Stromboli and a kids spaghetti. Topped off with a small cinnamon Zeppoli and brownie. All were fantastic. That Stromboli was so freaking huge and yummy as was everything. Nice staff and timely on the food. We took it to go but there is a dinning area to eat in as well. We will be back thank you for the yumminess!"}
{"text":"I came here because of a coupon.  

Great pizza. Amazing garlic knots  and homemade ranch. 

Friendly service.  I'd come again, even without the coupon."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a five star, but 5 means perfect. They have so many choices, which is usually bad for a restaurant, but really makes this one stand out. Their pizza tastes like childhood, and not the crappy, awful pizza you would gobble up either. Cheese is evenly distributed, not too much sauce, and a decent crust to top it off. The atmosphere is lovely and I have to talk about the donuts. The zeppoli (powdered sugar option) is soooo good. Those little bits of dough covered in that sugar are mouth watering. I can't wait to come back soon and try even more. Their garlic knots look amazing and my boyfriend says the Stromboli looks great! Definitely would recommend!!! (Hint: try some ranch on your pizza. You won't regret it.)"}
{"text":"I have recently been coming here for my lunch breaks almost everyday. Can't beat their happy hour pricing. The service here is always great and fast. I enjoy my hour lunch and the pizza has been consistently good. I live in north Las Vegas but would travel all the way over here just for their pizza and wings. They also have homemade ranch and it's amazing! I will definitely be a loyal customer here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Villa since I was really young and I absolutely love the place. From the pizza to chicken fingers to the zepolis! My FAVORITE the chicken parm dinner which comes with bread and a side salad. I enjoy all the specials they offer during the week and will catch my self coming in alone just to get the happy hour special and pizza and chicken fingers. The staff is super friendly and give great service."}
{"text":"I come here in secret on my cheat day. I always come for lunch-always get my week's carb fix. It is really good pizza, they have great and friendly service and it's kind of like a family friendly pizzeria more reminiscent of East Coast USA than anything out here. 

Though I come to cheat on pizza their menu is far more diverse. They also have special nights for kids-I for sure should bring my kids here. 

They also have daily specials!!!"}
{"text":"There pizza is most deff better then average. Even the left overs still taste good the next day. I love that they use fresh basil I once ordered basil as a topping from somewhere else and it was the dried kind. Disappointing. Not here. Kinda surprised they don't have better reviews here on yelp. Or more stars. I have always gotten take out."}
{"text":"Best pizza around.  It's been 5 years since my last visit having moved away.  I just wish they had a place in Northern California!"}
