{"text":"I've only given this place a try once, but it was not a bad experience. They were quite busy as this was at the Cabinet announcement ceremony for Rachel Notley and the rest of the Alberta government, but they did have a few things from their menu available -- and their combo deal was the cheapest way of getting a meal and drink from a food truck in the vicinity. 

The noodles were a bit bland (I should have added more fish sauce probably) but the meat was cooked precisely how I like it. I just wish that they had beef as well as chicken as I was more in the mood for beef. I had to remove the cilantro from my meal as I hate cilantro but it wasn't too cilantroified. It could have used more veggies but was on par for other Vietnamese food restaurants I think, especially for food truck food. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this place out, but it clearly wasn't bad either and was the best option of the food trucks available at the time and my particular food desires. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them a try as I was walking through Edmonton Street Performers food trucks and unfortunately they are only a food truck as they do not have a restaurant in town, which is too bad because their food is delicious as all Vietnamese food are.

Vietnamese are Cool Meals for Warm Summer Nights. 

And as for the service was, I left my boyfriend to grab my food while I grab lemonade for us which was only a couple of minutes, and my food was out ready for me to pick up. Talk about quick service."}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself downtown during the lunch hour, I find myself coming back to this food truck. The food is delicious. I normally order the lemongrass chicken combo. Sure the vermicelli is cold, but I wouldn't want it piping hot on a summer day either. The veggies is more of a simple cold salad of lettuce, mint & cucumbers. Although it's bland, there's a huge selection of sauces on the side to jazz up the flavor. The perfectly grilled chicken skewers & crispy spring rolls are the star of this dish. And for $10 for a combo, it's a really good sized portion for a food truck. The staff are also friendly as well. The only thing I had to knock a star off for is wait time. Ordering is the quick part, but when you have to wait 15-20 min to get your food; it really cuts a lot of time off your lunch hour. At least you know that the food was cooked fresh on the spot!"}
{"text":"I really want to give them more stars as the people at this truck are top notch.. just the food isn't really.  Granted I've tried one thing which is the lemon grass chicken on vermicelli but both times, I found the chicken to be excellent but the vegetable vermicelli to leave you wanting.  The vegetables don't look very fresh and the noodles are really cold, leaving you with a lukewarm dish when you add the sizzling meat on top.  If you want a decent snack or small lunch to go, grab the skewers.. that's my best suggestion."}
