{"text":"This was my 4th time coming here and it was good every time with a great price portions are well over satisfactory. I ordered beef and broccoli my girlfriend got orange chicken both were fresh the broccoli was not soggy or over cooked like most places the orange chicken had great flavor and moist less batter and more chicken how it should be."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. They were very pleasant over the phone. Ordered four large entrees and paid around 40 bucks. The food was good for chinese... Their crab rangoons were a decent size and very good."}
{"text":"Currently this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. The portions are generous and the food is amazing.  Unlike some other restaurants, the mongolian beef here was seared and tender and was not full of chewy grizzle.  The kung pao chicken was also very good and came with a lot of crunchy peanuts on top instead of being mixed in and soft. The  woman who took our order at the counter was also very nice.  Way to go Chop Chop Wok!!"}
{"text":"From a Mott St. regular. Finally, Chinse food I can eat without having to go to the strip, and Cantonese doesn't seem popular in Vegas' China Town. I've tried every place in a radius from W. Lake Mead north Tulley Springs and from Buffalo east to NLV. Never finished a meal at any. Stumbled here thanx to the reviews.   I always test a new place with wonton soup (oh my, the real NY style crispy noodles), chow fun, beef and broccoli, and pork fried rice. Hard to believe any Chinese place could mess these up. but they have. The broc was bright, fresh and crisp, and the beef lean and tender. The soup was packed w/ fresh veggies and tasty quality dumplings. The fried rice, how can they afford to give so much, it will feed me for a week.  Ordered over phone and had it delivered. Okay now this review might start to sound fake, cause I ain't foolin 35 mins. later it was piping hot at my door. No s-- t. i have waited up to 90 min in this town for my food to be delivered. Losing not only my sanity but my appetite. Both the driver and the order taker was very friendly.   Worked up a hunger gonna eat some Chop Chop leftovers."}
{"text":"Discovered this little place in the back corner of a strip mall near the freeway. The food is great and very delicious and they prepare it very quickly. They serve both Chinese and Japanese fare and the price is comparable to other restaurants in the area. My favorite dish here is the mein fun which uses the very thin rice noodles, similar to the kind used in traditional Filipino pancit, and no matter which protein y get with it, it all tastes very good. The war wonton soup does not disappoint either!"}
{"text":"We just got delivery of our food and it was delicious! We had orange beef, lemon chicken, chicken fried rice and crab rangoons and we enjoyed every bit! Highly recommend - good quality for the price!"}
{"text":"Second time we've ordered delivery and the first time they told us it would cost an additional 2 hra after we had already waited an hr and half. Decided to give this place another chance, they called to say it would be and 45 mins. The lady jenny who answers the phone aways so rude! Hangs up before i finished talking on both occasions. I wouldn't even give it a star! Chinese food is disgusting. Worst mistake!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars. I got nothing bad to say about them.  Great service, They always nice. The food is great and always fresh. The place is small and the decoration is not so fancy but  we usually carry out.  If you like spicy food their Mongolian beef, my favorite, is a must."}
{"text":"Just moved over to the area  and our other local Chinese food place no longer are able to deliver to us...so went on yelp and saw a few reviews....called and spoke to a very nice man named Leo. He took our order and I asked him if they had any coupons if you spend a certain $$ amount do you guys give any extra(s) such as an extra spring roll(s) or crab ran goons, which are my favorite hehe, he said that it didn't apply to the family dinner option we ordered.... But when we received our order he had added a couple extra In there. Nice touch, for our first time.. Don't expect it every time of coarse but could see he wanted to earn our business .. Def will call them for our next time...... ;) wanted to try a couple other places in the area too...but will be back here food was good and hot and yummy ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout restaurant in Las Vegas. The food here is great and always fast. The lunch combos are an amazing deal. I have been visiting this restaurant for over 5 years and the owners are just as friendly and the food is just as good as the first time."}
{"text":"The staff is so sweet and super helpful when there was an issue with my charges. I got the Mongolian beef combo which was delicious and super cheap."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is hard to find in Las Vegas. Chop Chop Wok is by far there best we have found. An added bonus is the fast, free delivery. Our favorites are the house lo mein,  shrimp fried rice, sesame chicjen, sweet and sour chicken and mu shu pork. All of these items are great."}
{"text":"Chop Chop Wok is as good as it gets for me as far as Chinese food is concerned. I feel it is more of a 4 1/2 star place, but I had to round up because they are just so pleasant here & when you are waiting on an order, they will actually walk it out to your car. Now that is like Nordstrom/Nob Hill type service right there! Btw, Nob Hill is an upscale grocery store in NorCal & I know all my NorCal peeps will get that reference ;)  So...the food is really tasty here & the ingredients are nice & fresh. The beef broccoli is some of the best I have had. The beef is really quite good. Not at all like that weird tasting & texturally displeasing mystery meat usually found in this dish. And the broccoli is nice & crunchy & has a nice fresh, bright green look to it. I also LOVE the Lo Mein! Lol, which is actually Chow Mein, at least where I'm from. Either way, it is on point. They also have really good lunch specials & you definitely cannot beat the prices here.  I am SUPER picky when it comes to Chinese food & I will not just go anywhere. There has to be some sort of buzz or word of mouth about a place before I will try it. So, I would like to thank all of my fellow Yelpers that helped me decide on trying Chop Chop Wok. And to the staff, I think you all are great & you treat people with great warmth & friendliness. Not as customers, but as friends or an extended hungry family member ;)"}
{"text":"I have lived all over the U.S. and this is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have EVER found. It is definitely the best I have run across in Las Vegas! The one dish that I rate Chinese restaurants by is egg drop soup. They do it perfectly at Chop  Chop Wok. There is a very clean taste to the chicken broth. Peas, carrots, and corn are also added. The workers are friendly and prompt with service. We also order home delivery which is also very prompt. Some of my favorite dishes are their General Tso Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Shrimp Fried Rice. Prices are very low for the quality of the food. I am so happy this restaurant is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"this is The place for go to Chinese lunch. I will pick this restaurant over Panda Express any day! The lunch special include either a soup (hot & sour or egg drop) or a can soda for around $6+ ?? Well worth it"}
{"text":"No Good, the $40.00 dollars worth of food seemed like if it was a day old. Once we started to eat things became worst. The flavors were very bland and the veggies tasted soggy and stale. The orange chicken is pure batter and the beef and broccoli was under cooked.   The service was good and fast.... but thats the only part of the experience that turned out right."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! I loved the Mongolian beef! It was really good! Got a vegetable eggroll and an extra cream cheese ragoon. Well food here was super and really good! Can't say nothing more!"}
{"text":"So as reasonable Chinese take out goes I love this place. Food is prepared well, it is flavorful and extremely reasonable! I would go here over the chains i.e. China a Go Go, China Joe's etc any day. Also i love that this appears to be a family run business and they are very nice. I wish however that they had an eggplant dish but nonetheless i would still opt to go here!  OK so apparently I started this review a year ago, but I would like to add that nothing has changed over the past year I have come here numerous times. Kind of funny and yet creepy but my name must pop up in their computer when I call because they know my name (think \"Norm\" from Cheers - and yes I realize I am dating myself). The place to go if you are craving cheap Chinese food in the northwest. Not authentic Chinese but your typical Kung Pao, Sweet and Sour Chinese style, which has its place in the world too."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from CCW and it was delicious!  I have been looking for a good Chinese place for years, and this one delivered...literally. We had the war won ton soup, sesame chicken, beef with broccoli and shrimp with snow peas and everything was delivered hot and delicious. It was also great to get the order we actually placed! Can't wait to try it again"}
{"text":"I got some sushi from here and it was horrible!! It was filled with little fish bones throughout the entire two rolls I purchased!! Don't bother buying sushi from here!!"}
{"text":"Our iPhone sent us here. Sari was right on the mark , great food and very reasonably priced and the plates were full! Small cozy restaurant in a strip mall off the 95 freeway near Rainbow."}
{"text":"I love this place and am a regular, however I am not very happy with my past 3 orders from you guys! Is there a new cook in the kitchen? Tonight I ordered food, and my pork fried rice tasted like it was just reheated and so very very dry, I couldn't finish eating it. Come on guys lets please fix this situation, I really like your restaurant an do not wish to stop ordering from you, however i will if i must"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and food was delicious! happy & full :)  shrimp lo mein & miso soup :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the following for delivery: -Wonton soup(small).  -Beef broccoli combination with house fried rice. -Chicken teriyaki(small).  -Vegetable Lo mein(extra vegetable)-large.  -Vegetable rolls.  -Szechuan pork (small).   Restaurant was smart enough to create vent holes on the lids of the takeout boxes so the condensation doesn't drip into the food during delivery-Thanks Chop chop. Delivery time was said to be 45 minutes. Food arrived in less than 30 minutes.   All the food was fresh (not over cooked), delicious and the quantities were very abundant for being small (please see posted pictures for food quality and appearance). All this, under $50.00. Can't beat that. And to top it off, the delivery driver was polite and courteous.  I give them a 4.0 for their food and 4.5 for their service."}
{"text":"Fantastic cheap Chinese food. I always have them deliver and I'm never disappointed. Plan on delivery times of between 45-60 minutes."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Chinese food and for a more than decent price, you have found thee spot! I literally lived out of this place when I was living on my own. The main girl that is up front is the sweetest person ever and I never have any problems with my order. I'm kind of picky and I always ask to replace my rice with steamed broccoli and most places always give me the run around, say they don't do that or tell me its going to cost extra (which makes not sense considering its easier to steam broccoli then it is to fry rice). Anyways, by now they know me and I always order orange chicken w/ steamed broccoli. The best part about it is it's never soaked in all the juices that come with your food and it's actually made like no other Chinese place I've seen here in Las Vegas. The restaurant decor isn't to die for, but I really love it and think it's a cute, little \"hole in the wall\" place that everyone should definitely try out. They also make sushi and better then some actually sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Overall I always walk out with the correct order, a smile on my face and I'm always suggesting this place to anyone that asks for a great Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"THE BEST!!! Always fresh hot and delicious!  Fast and friendly even when they deliver.  One of our FAVORITE places to eat in ALL of Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Food tastes really good and very affordable. I order here for pick up/to go and I usually get eggplant with tofu and the general tso's chicken.. and their shrimp fried rice is really good too!"}
{"text":"They make the best egg foo yung!! So fluffy and the gravy is so good!! Prices are affordable, especially the lunch specials! Great place for quick & satisfying food. Will come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did based on all the effusive reviews.  First off, this place is a reasonable drive, over 12 miles from the house so it can't be considered part of the home territory.  We ordered the vegetable lo mein, chicken lo mein, sesame chicken and wor won ton soup.  Calling slightly ahead it was ready when we arrived and the lady at the counter was very sweet and wished us a happy holiday.    The experience when we got home was okay, but nothing like what we expected based on others opinion and the fact that there were quite a few people eating in when we walked in.    The sesame chicken was very salty and the lo mein slightly more watery and sweet than I like.  The soup was also very salty and so hot that it suffers from the same symptoms of other Chinese take-out soups:  limp soft vegetables and won ton noodles disassembling.  It still puzzles me.  You'd think they'd have tried planning out how much they cook everything before it goes into the take-out container.  I liked the shrimp and the won ton filling was good but I wouldn't order it again.  On the plus side, the prices here are some of the lowest I've seen for Americanized Chinese dive food.    Oh well.  The quest continues."}
{"text":"Great food and staff have been coming here for close to 5 years very nice people and they make my food just how i like it steamed :)"}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff. Portions are huge. Food is well prepared and tastes good. Already looking forward to the take home and we are just leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking for a yummy Chinese food spot when I found Chop Chop on Yelp, I ordered some for pickup and it was super fast and easy through Yelp. I got there in about 20 mins and the food was hot and ready. I'm not sure of her name but there was a lovely lady there who rang me up, she was fast and friendly. My girlfriend and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the chop chop wok!! Jenny is the one who always helps me and she's always nice to me. I always come here for the shrimp Lo Mein and it's ALWAYS consistent and tastes amazing! They always give lots of shrimp with it too. The owners care about being personal to all customers and making sure the quality of food stays the same. Another big plus is their speedy delivery service. We live about 2 Miles away and they always deliver fast. Thanks Jenny!"}
{"text":"Great service good food. Hot n sour soup, great. Love the won tons and rangoons. Always delivered in a timely manor."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the price or the taste.  It's a little ma and pop Chinese place with lunch and combo specials and a large order of chicken fried rice for only $3.99!   I will keep coming back to this place as long as it's open!"}
{"text":"Horrible Chinese Food! Can't believe it's ratings for the quality of food. Their food taste old and overload with sauces to hide or mask low quality of food. I ordered $40 worth of food and after trying everything, we only ate the fried rice. It just seemed the safest thing to eat.  Their chicken had a weird chewy flavor, and seemed as if they buy it pre-cooked and frozen....than simply toss it in panko breadcrumbs for the chicken Katsu. The breadcrumbs feel off and the chicken was still cold from the middle. The orange \"chicken\" looked like pork and tasted like deep fried pork, all chewy and old taste. Lomein had a smooky smell to it, which never have I had it happen anywhere else. Overall, old flavor and old food taste throughout all the food. Very disappointed, definitely a waste of money if you order from here. Even panda taste better than this."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for take out, then they tell me they lost my ticket and asked what I ordered. They claimed the food was ready, they simply needed to create a new ticket. Lie. 29 minutes still sitting here waiting for food. I will never return. Might update this review to 1 star if the food is bad"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat, with good hard working people and the serve good food. I've been going here for a little over 2 years now and have never been disappointed. I'm a little bit of a foodie but not a snob and I appreciate the product this place.  They obviously have a great deal of passion for what they do :)"}
{"text":"My family and I usually choose this place when we want Chinese food and the prices are great and the food is delicious! We just ordered in and had a discussion about how long they would take to deliver so we decided to time them. 15 minutes for delivery and the food is great as always! Totally satisfied with our choice."}
{"text":"First time going here, my friend recommended it. I asked if any of the food had onions she said the fried rice does, I told her I can't eat onions, nothing from the order that I placed has onions right? Correct she said! I get home and low and behold the general chicken has a lot of onions... Went in the garbage!  I go back today and she did not apologize, she didn't care, I asked of I can substitute the lunch special rice for lowmain because I can get it with onions and she said that's $4 more!!!! Are u fucking kidding me! You messed up my order and could have had an allergic reactions and I'm giving u a opportunity to make it right and u expect me to pay! Get the fuck outta here! Won't EVER go back! Horrible way to treat your customer!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Great service. Inexpensive. Great food. Even delivers. Mine & my husbands new favorite little find."}
{"text":"The best in town. Seriously. So cheap and so delish. I would recommend the WOR WONTON SOUP!!"}
{"text":"I had quit going to chop chop wok for about a year.  I had given a 5 star rating review in the past.  About s year ago, I gave it a three because their quality wasn't up to par anymore.  We had gone several times over a period of a couple of months before we quit going.  We were in the area yesterday, so we decided to give it another try.  It seems that they have gone back to the way they used to be!  I'm happy to say everything was good!  I would like to give the restaurant its 5 star rating again, but only time will tell."}
{"text":"You just can't find better food for the money. I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. Everything is so fast pick up, delivery or dine in. The lunch special and combo special is an absolute bargain. The people here are very nice, don't give your money to corporate trash like Panda Express come here and get some even better food for less money! Chop chop wok is my Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Delicious! Husband picked up dinner from here last night... We had crab Rangoon, pork fried rice, and chicken lo mein. Everything was very tasty and huge portions.  Extremely satisfied with the price, too! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great size portions!!! Right around the corner from home. Can't beat that!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for take out or delivery.  All of the Chinese food is good and the staff is always very friendly.  Top three items are Crab Rangoons, any of the Lo Meins and Mu Shu Pork.  I ordered sushi from Chop Chop once, it wasn't fantastic, but stick with the Chinese and you can't go wrong.  Huge portions for the price too, we always have left overs!"}
{"text":"I always come here for a quick bite or lunch. I love the Rangoon and chow mein. The staff pretty much knows what I'm going to order and I love it. They are genuinely happy to cook and serve. They even deliver too! Make sure to tip well."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Las vegas!! I am so happy to have found this place. You will not regret eating here at all. Don't let the little spot fool you, their food is full of flavors and the best part is that it's not greasy!!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I must say this place is simply amazing, if your looking for great food this is definitely the place, there spicy Mongolian beef is exquisite make this your next destination"}
{"text":"Now that is what I expect when I order Chinese after an awful day at work and no will to cook. Very friendly phone convo, repeated my order, was there in the time specified. Delivery guy was equally sweet. And the food! Piping hot, great flavor and spice, not too oily or greasy. Sweet and sour sauce was thick, not watered down. Spring rolls were crispy and light, not drenched in oil. Chicken was tender, not overcooked and grisly. Portions were huge. This is my new go to place. Dragon Wok and China A Go Go should take lessons! Thanks for a happy belly Chop Chop!!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, and the price is unbeatable! The owners are very nice too. There's very limited seating so I'd recommend ordering food to-go. The best value is definitely the lunch special. It's less than $6 for a styrofoam container FULL of the entree and rice; also included was a bowl of soup and eggroll. Less expensive, better quality, and way more food for your money than some place like Panda Express. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wish they were located doen south. The food is cooked to perfection i swear! Its full of flavor and never oily. When I'm up north, its a must for me to stop in. Plus the employees are so sweet!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's not pricey at all, the portions of food you get are even better. They are always friendly and happy people everything I'm in there. Totally recommend this to anyone who wants amazing Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't know if we came on a bad night or we just don't fit the demographic that frequents this place, but this was the worst Chinese food we've had in LV. My Hunan beef tasted like cigarettes and my husband's orange chicken tasted like dirty oil. Maybe it was just a fluke night for them but it was enough for us to never come back."}
{"text":"Once again they are soooo accomadating..I had wanted the chicken katsu box, but instead of the other Japanese stuff that comes with it I wanted pork fried rice and of course it was no problem.  She also remembered that I always want a side of garlic sauce to put on my rice. My son always gets Mongolian beef, xtra spicy and she knew that too.  Its so nice to go into a place that truly appreciates it customers and adds a personal touch.  That goes a long way in my book. This is just a great takeout place that my whole family loves!!!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out, and very impressed.  Schezuan Chicken great flavor , MuShoo Pork one of the best I've had.  Both were ordered as Small Size dinner portion ($5.95) and came with side of white rice. Shrimp fried rice is made like it is on the east coast with soy as its dark in color not like the yellow fried rice you see at Panda Express. Singapore noodles were very good (chicken pork and shrimp all included).  Friend ordered sushi said it was just OK. Will for sure repeat ..5 Stars in my book . Thank you !"}
{"text":"I am waiting for my food after ordering it at 545pm. Called the woman said it would be here 40 minutes ago. Heading to China a go go to get Saturday night dinner. Thanks for the great service! My 72 year old mother truly appreciated it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last nite and looooooved it...i was starving and for a low price I was fill to the point of excessive breathing(lol)...im waiting on another delivery now"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food place here in Las Vegas. Very Friendly staff. I wouldn't go to any other."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here! They're egg drop soup is delicious and the owners are the friendliest, most courteous people you will ever meet, always on time when they deliver, highly recommend them, great food and great service, what more do you want! LOL"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's usually the go-to delivery place in my house. We love their food so much and the owners are such sweethearts.  We typically order family meal A with our choice of entree and it's amazing every single time. The wontons are to die for and ditto with the potstickers.   It's tucked away in the back of the shopping center, and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I love chop chop wok. Some of the best egg foo young I have found here in Las Vegas. I also really enjoy their chop suey which for some reason is hard to find. Not the fanciest place but the food is really good."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. They always get my order right and know my name by my order (Mongolian beef it's to die for) lol. The young lady who manages the phones I don't know her name but she is the BEST!"}
{"text":"This was our fur time ordering from this restaurant, so we were a bit cautious. We ordered the Mongolian beef (x2), dragon and Phoenix, shrimp lo mein and shrimp egg rolls, pot stickers, crab Rangoon and Chinese donuts. We ordered one extra extra spicy Mongolian beef and one medium spicy - neither of which had even the slightest hint of heat - my 4 year old granddaughter enjoyed the extra extra spicy! The flavor was good, however without the kick it was more like pepper steak. The shrimp egg rolls were absolutely amazing, the crab Rangoon didn't have much crab but the taste was good. The lo mein and dragon and Phoenix were awesome. The food arrived hot even though it took an hour and 45 minutes from Order time to delivery. The portion sizes were humongous. The only other issue we had was I had requested pork fried rice without peas but we received white sticky rice instead."}
{"text":"So friendly! Yummy food! Great prices for great portions! Steamed dumplings are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Came into this place actually only because I was unable to find the restaurant I was looking for. I explained it was my first time trying them and asked to look at their menu. My 5 year old loves fried rice and chow mein. I asked if there was any way they could please make a combo plate with just fried rice and chow mein and they said NO! Lol! I can't believe that. Money wasn't an object and I am very surprised that this was an issue. Especially considering there wasn't anyone else in this entire place. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"You decide.  I bought take out last night.  Ordered 4 main courses, two fried rice, and one noodles.  Called them when I got home to make DOUBLE SURE that they did not use peanuts in their cooking of those items.  I was told they did NOT.  This morning is the day after our hospital EMERGENCY room trip 20 minutes into the meal, my husbands throat was swelling closed and it could have been fatal.  Yes, he's allergic to peanuts. Yes, we verified that there were no peanuts used, I was told 'we don't use peanuts'. Obviously we were misinformed by management.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The typical chinese food. Portions could be bigger for the price. Very fresh and made on the spot. Would return."}
{"text":"While some of the food was delicious, I'm upset that instead of the orange chicken I ordered, I received beef and vegetables. The vegetables seemed a day old. Disappointed..but the seafood delight was good."}
{"text":"We are nee to the location and our friend recommended this restaurant. They are pretty good for delivery Chinese, they're fast with delivery, food is  priced well, and the quality and taste is very good."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for neighborhood Chinese food, this is the spot.  There aren't any dishes too unique or authentic Chinese, but the guilo dishes served here are very inexpensive and the best I've had.  Get your Kung Pao fix here!"}
{"text":"I really was hopeful this place was going to be good. Sadly, my assessment of Chinese food in Las Vegas remains unwavering. Granted, I'm a native San Franciscan who grew up with Mandarin, Szechwan, and Cantonese restaurants all within a few blocks of each other. The Vegas Chinese food scene continues to bore and disappoint at any price point. Yawn. Like I said I really wanted to like this place. The owner is so nice and really trying hard to make a go of it. The prices are ridiculously low. I walked out with 7 pounds of food for $22. 3 large entrees and steamed rice. For value, you get a lot for a little $. I felt guilty paying so little so I tipped her well.   Sweet and sour pork. Bleh. Obviously frozen pork, cheap voluminous breading and anemic peppers on the side. Pass.  Chicken fried rice. The clear winner. Inexpensive and would order again.   Szechwan garlic chicken. Looked better than it tasted. Broccoli frozen prior to cooking, garlic non existent, and the sauce was more tasteless than Panda Express (the King of spewy Chinese food in my snobby opinion).  No dim sum to be seen.  Too bad.  I'll just book my flight to SFO and head to the Richmond District or Chinatown the next time I have a hankering for good Chinese. :("}
{"text":"As always the food came before the scheduled time and it was fresh and hot. I ordered the egg drop soup, veggie egg foo young, veggie egg rolls,and beef fried rice. Everything super tasty. I am never disappointed with their food. Their sauce for the egg foo young is a bit salty but I always enjoy the flavor and drench my egg foo young with it. I've been a bit under the weather so the egg drop soup was hot and delicious. As always I'm never disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"So I've been here alot. And I do always order the same food and drink. They will remember you, to a fault. Today I walked in without my partner and they  said ,\"alone\", yes, suddenly I felt like Katherine Hiegel in 27 dresses. The bathroom is not great but its clean enough. The food is fresh and hot never disappointments. Bottom line eat here.The Lady recommends it."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp when looking for a new place to try near our dry cleaner.   My wife got the broiled eel combo plate, and I got the Mongolian beef combo plate. Both were quite good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We tried lots of places before this Chop Chop wok is the best Jenny and her husband are super kind and there sushi is wonderful plus there prices are great"}
{"text":"Amazing! We had Mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, moo shu pork, a war wonton soup. Fresh flavors, spicy, hot, fantastic. Owner was serving and very accommodating and very nice. We will return here when we come back to Vegas"}
{"text":"Found this little place here on yelp. Its a tiny place in a strip mall but always seems to have people picking up orders. The pork fried rice is yummy and so is the cashew chicken. I also like the crab rangoons, but other then that I'm not a die hard fan. Its a great place for a late night Chinese food fix. Decent inside although I'm not a fan of not being able to see into the kitchen at all! So when I'm on that side of town and i feel like having some rice Ill stop by but I don't think I would drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I get the Chinese donuts. I don't know why they are so mind blowing but they are just amazing!!!!! I recommend trying them if you have a sweet tooth :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I always get the general tso chicken n sub for white meat... so worth it!... fried rice is delicious and they are so friendly"}
{"text":"Has to be the worst Chinese delivery ever! Took over an hour and half to get three orders when she initially said 30 minutes. I wish that was the only problem but once we opened the boxes my Mongolian beef was a plate of onions and green pepper, the fried rice had some indistinguishable meat and the portions are tiny. Hate to give a local business one star but people need to know before wasting their money on this joint."}
{"text":"When reading reviews for everywhere, there will be good reviews as well as bad. For a small, family owned spot with reasonable prices, I don't expect the tables to be sparkling or the floor to be  so clean you could eat off of it. I expect friendly faces, great customer service and a \"thank you\". I get exactly what I expect each and every time I go there. Keep in mind this is a take out spot, if you dine in, you may not have a waitress, just someone to check in once and a while, especially if they're busy. Great Chinese food, great prices, great people."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of mom and pop shops that may appear sketchy on the outside (and the inside.) You'll never know what pleasant hidden gems you may find unless you give them a try.   We went based on the sheer fact that they were open later than most Chinese restaurants in the area. The antiquated blue interior was uneasy on the eyes, but it was clean.   They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time.   The good: Crab Rangoon $4.25 - 6 large pieces of crispy golden fried wontons stuffed with cream cheese. Very addicting! We enjoyed it with their sweet and sour sauce. 5/5  Hot and sour soup - we ordered a small $1.60 and it was piping hot and the perfect size to share. Great flavor! 5/5  Moo shu pork served with eggroll wrappers and hoisen sauce - we ordered a large $8.25 and it was a very generous serving. It had mushrooms, cabbage, pork, and bamboo shoots. It was a great version and we really enjoyed this flavorful dish. 5/5  The bad: Sweet and sour pork - ok, so we definitely took the wrong step with this dish. We ordered a large $8.25 and although the portion was massive, each pork morsel had way too much breading. Just imagine the dough on corn dogs...each pork was excessively covered in thick dough. Way too filling, in a bad way. It was bland as well, so we added salt to the sauce and it helped. Also, they barely gave us any vegetables and pineapple, so overall it wasn't a balanced dish. Nope I wouldn't order it again, it was poorly executed. 1/5"}
{"text":"Update -- I went back for lunch again and the dining room was immaculate.  I was more than happy eating my lunch at one of their tables."}
{"text":"We order all the time.  Always comes warm and quick."}
{"text":"the lady that took my orders was very nice. she even asked me if i need it fast coz she noticed that i'm in a hurry. foods were yummy too"}
{"text":"Food was ok... service was very slow..waited over 30 minutes but was reasonably priced so i guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great Chinese very fresh and tasty, quick simple and cheap.  I was impressed with quality and price, value is huge here!    I like a place that gives you a crab rangoon, and egg roll with your meal for free, tasty stuff.  HIghly recommended.!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot. The food was inexpensive and delicious. The portions are huge especially for the price. It was under $20 for 2 people to eat. Its kind of a hole in the wall place but this is kind of the way I like my Chinese joints. Most people would probable not go in based on the way it looks from the street But Yelp has not let me down yet."}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. They know us and know what we want when we come through the door."}
{"text":"This place is a great hidden gem. I came in with a specific to go order with a few special requests and the clerk who helped me was awesome, not only was he helpful but didn't seem the least flustered. I certainly appreciate great service, as to the food, it was great.  Mongolian beef: great flavor, nice amount of heat but not overwhelming. The dish does have a lot of vegetables like other reviewers mentioned but that's not a huge deal for me, especially since they were cooked well and added to the flavor.  Sweet and sour pork: I wasn't really used to seeing the sauce on the side, but that won't deter me from ordering again. When dipped into the sauce it all came together well and it lets you add as much or as little as you like. It also has the added bonus of not making the breading soggy.  Hot and sour soup: lives up to its name in a good way, a flavorful broth with a nice ratio of tofu, mushrooms and pork.  Egg flower soup: I'm not a fan of this in general so I skipped it, but my wife enjoyed it.  Pork fried rice: one of the best I've ever had, not over loaded with vegetable and full of big chunks pork in every bite.  The bottom line, try it for yourself but I have found my new go to spot for Chinese take out."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite American Chinese food places.   I really like their lunch specials (under 6 bucks!) - it comes with plenty of food!  I usually eat my lunch special for lunch AND dinner!   I like getting their chicken and broccoli with egg drop soup, great amount of chicken and the sauce is on point.  I even like their fried wonton strips that comes with the soup.  I also like their lo mein, the small order is HUGE and they give a good amount of protein.  I've always ordered delivery so I've never been to the shop.  But upon researching the location, it seems like it's right behind Wendy's by Cheyenne and Rainbow.  I'm gonna have to stop by one day since I'm close by."}
{"text":"We order delivery from here and we love it.  Usually when we order Chinese delivery the food is mediocre, but here the food is pretty good.  Not only are their prices more than reasonable, their food comes hot and their fried options come crispy.  They don't skimp on serving size, so we always order the small options.  Although their sweet & sour chicken and pork is the stereotypical radioactive red sauce and over-battered meat, it's still good.  Who doesn't like that kind of crap once in awhile?  As for their other menu items, everything is good to go.  My husband digs their egg foo yong a lot and I love their beef with broccoli.  We ordered six dishes for 30 bucks, and they don't have a delivery charge, so we tip generously.  Great service, great food for a lazy night.  I can't say that I'm a fan because it's not something I'll order every week, but it's decent chinese food in the west side."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. Every time we end up with more food to take home and we were able to eat. Reasonable prices friendly service quite atmosphere. The walnut shrimp is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap with a super friendly staff. Food takes no time to get to your table, and they literally have the most delicious crab rangoons in the universe. I also really like the French fries and chicken nuggets, which are weirdly great for a Chinese restaurant. Faaaaaabulous."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for sometime. Since we eat here all the time. Seriously like once a week. I've liked everything I've had. There combos are a fantastic value and they're very kind and courteous. This isn't blow your mind spring mountain Asian cuisine but this is our go to for suburban take out and that's exactly what it is."}
{"text":"My first time eating Chinese food in Las Vegas and I have to say it was decent. Price was worth it."}
{"text":"As a place that dabbles in the area of asian cuisine, chop chop wok doesn't do much to set itself apart from any other asian / or chinese takeout restaurant. However, they do have a $5 special for students that gives them a choice of two items on the specific menu posted for them, which is absolutely a great alternative as some items in the store are a tad bit costly.  I will usually order the shrimp fried rice along with some sweet and sour chicken and spring rolls and that will usually fill me up without a doubt. If there was one thing I could suggest, it's to update the menu just a little bit and introduce some new things that no other place has in regards to food!"}
{"text":"What happens when you marry really good American Chinese food and some time in the fridge? You get the best leftovers ever!   I always judge Chinese food by how it tastes a day or two later when it has had a chance fro the noodles to absorb with the sauces and bring out the flavors. This place has generous portions, no MSG, and flavors galore.  This is a no-brainer for anyone on this side of town, Heck, any part of town! I'm just glad it is closer to me than farther away. Do yourself a flavor favor and check this place out. I'd give extra love to the Broccoli Beef and the Chow Mein noodles. And made to order at the time of ordering."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here. The gentleman who answered the phone was very friendly and helpful. We were given a delivery time of 45 minutes but it actually only took 30! The food was very good and we have some picky kids. They loved it. We ordered steamed dumplings, chicken lo mein, broccoli beef, sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. I'm not a fan of fried stuff in general but the dumplings and broccoli beef were quite tasty. Cost was great, about $60. Not bad at all for 7 people and we had lots of leftovers. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"One of only two Chinese food places I go to and for simple reasons the food is always fast and fresh, most Chinese restaurants I've been to always have large amounts of onions and bell peppers in their servings although there is onion and bell peppers in their dishes Chop Chop Wok vegetables are chopped smaller giving the vegetables a chance to actually cook. In all the time that I have been going here the staff is always friendly and even know my order when I walk into the door."}
{"text":"They say open at 10am but they are ALWAYS ALWAYS late. Food is alright, but the man behind the cashier always brings a bag of food from inside his trunk which I have no idea what it is.  I am definitely questioning their 'A' food grade."}
{"text":"The one thing we need in Vegas is better Chinese food delivery.  It's hard to find good Chinese food, unless you live near at Chinatown.  We were craving Chinese but were too lazy to drive, so we turned to yelp to find the best delivery in our area.    The food here was pretty good.  Menu seems simple.  Delivery was fast.  We ordered 4 dishes which came out to $37.  Portions were huge.    The orange chicken was the best thing we ordered.  Big chunks of chicken that was seasoned and cooked well.  The kung pao chicken was okay.  Huge portion but a tiny amount of meat.  It was basically kung pao veggies.  The Mongolian beef was okay.  Same problem.  Very little meat buried in a huge pile of onions.    The last dish was a thin white noodle dish in a clear sauce.  This would've been better but the noodles were soggy.   Maybe next time I'll pay extra and ask for double protein."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot but was not fantastic. We were looking for a quick cheap meal and found it. We ordered the family meal for the four of us. It came with egg drop soup, egg rolls, won tons, pork fried rice and two entrees. We ordered sesame chicken and kung pao  chicken. The quantity of food was perfect, in fact we couldn't finish it all. The kung pao was great and had fresh veggies and great flavor. The sesame chicken had a great flavor but the chicken tastes like it has a high quantity of fat and not chicken meat. The pork fried rice had some overcooked pieces of ham that were not edible. Overall we were satisfied but it was more due to the fact that we were really hungry and not the quality of the food."}
{"text":"My tablemate and I shared the General Tao chicken combo plate for dinner (with an eggroll, crab rangoon and pork fried rice). It was actually too much for both of us. We would have taken home leftovers if we weren't (sadly) flying back home that night. Love that they have combo plates for dinner! The General Tso chicken was tangy, sweet, spicy, crispy and absolutely delicious. I think they may deep fry the chicken twice to get that amazing crunch - something to keep in mind if you are limiting high fat food. For me, right after taste is the value/price element, and it was another winner there. A totally filling and delicious Chinese dinner for two for under 10 bucks. Ok, I'll say it. Winner, winner, Chinese chicken dinner. All in all, an awesome restaurant that I will certainly put on the Vegas rotation (next to Lotus of Siam, Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and In-n-Out) for the next visit! Still trying to find an amazing sushi place to add to that list..."}
{"text":"Food was amazing...staff was very friendly and it was ready to go on time!!! It scored at home as well - just found a new quick pick up place for late practice nights.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Chop Chop is my go to neighborhood chinese spot.  The only place that reminds me of home (Bay Area) chinese food. Prime example of \"hole in the wall\"   Everything is cheap and portions are ridiculous.  Service is A1.  Their lunch specials, you must try all!"}
{"text":"Its good. Nothing special  I got the special for 1 with one chicken ball instead of the chop suey  Chicken fried rice was blend"}
{"text":"This should definitely be rounded up to 3.5 stars mainly because of the $5 lunch deals from 11-2:30 during the week. They have plenty to choose from and the meals are actually really large and come with your choice of soup(egg drop or hot and sour) or a soda and then a spring roll or crab rangoon. All of that for $5? SIGN ME UP!  The food itself is typical American Chinese and isn't anything special. But when you are looking to grab something quick(my food was ordered and ready within 5 minutes) and tasty I'm not looking for something fine dining. Chop Chop Wok is tasty and makes my craving for Chinese dissipate. Yum"}
{"text":"Very quick service, food served in minutes. I recommend dining in, but take out seemed very popular too. Ordered chicken and broccoli . Had to try the Thai tea, definitely a 10/10."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for take out Chinese. The people are friendly, the food is ready quickly, and it's always great. Their Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers are my favorite. The house fried rice is good, too. It's got tons of meat."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The waitstaff is awesome. You can always dine in or takeout either way you're going to love the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The sushi is good but the Chinese food is awesome.  The crab Rangoon are especially good, they aren't fishy and there is plenty of filling per wonton.  We eat-in a few times a year, including every Christmas Eve but mostly order take-out. Our order is always correct and they aren't stingy with the sweet and sour sauce.  The staff is always very friendly.  The only drawback is that the restaurant on had five tables so it isn't good for a large crowd."}
{"text":"I tried this place because the reviews seem to be good. I ordered Mongolian beef and I have to say there was only 5 or 6 pieces of beef in it plus the onions are burnt! It had the bitter taste. It was disgusting! I thought maybe the cook messed up that time, so I tried again the second time...it's the same! Burnt onions...tasted so bitter I had to throw it away. Definitely not going back there again!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. I should have just gone to Panda Express. They brought me a salad and it was literally lettuce. No carrots or croutons. Nothing but lettuce. The lettuce was still wet from them washing it. It left a puddle of water on the plate afterwards. The didn't devein the shrimp in the tempura. I accidentally pulled it apart and saw the vein still in it which I thought was disgusting. The batter for it has absolutely no flavor. I didn't even to eat the tempura or battered vegetables. The California roll I got alright I guess. Just very disappointed in this place. Im surprised there's so many good reviews. Just save your money and don't go."}
{"text":"We were in town for vacation with a group of 20 ppl.  One started getting ill and by the time half of us had, we figured we needed the cure all \"Wonton Soup\",  LoMein with Beef, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken with Broccoli, Crab Puffs and Potstickers.  This was the only place we found on Yelp that we could actually read the menu.  It also offered family sized pans and was very reasonable.  We drove the 25 minutes to find it and our order was ready.   Soup was more like Special Wonton and LoMein and other dishes above were all very good.  Staff was a little sparse on Sweet n Sour Sauce, but we weren't feeling well so didn't feel like asking for more.  The food was really very tasty; worth the drive and heated up leftovers were very good too.   For 20 ppl our order was about $128.00.  Good price, taste and quality.  Glad we found it."}
{"text":"Not special.   Frozen vegetable medley,  thick sauce,  high sodium.  They do have chili oil with chili flakes.  The chicken skewers is a sweet teriyaki which I did not prefer.   Cleanliness was fair.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"You people have lost your minds.  Four stars to this place?  Ugh.  Clearly some Las Vegas folks need to get out more, and visit other Chinese restaurants that cook tasty Chinese food.  I came here on Saturday and \"dined in\", had the Pepper Steak, etc.  The food did not look appetizing, nor did it taste appetizing.  Thank gawd for the salt shaker.  From observing folks as I sat through my mistake, I take it a number of locals use this place for take out, not a dine in location.  They really need to do their homework and drive further away, and find decent Chinese food.  Avoid this place, I know I won't return.  Take greater pride in what you eat."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time this weekend. I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. The food was amazingly fresh and very tasty! The Wor Won Ton soup had fresh ingredients with great flavor coupled with the best hot mustard I've had in a long time. The fried rice, shrimp (huge) and vegetables amazing! I'm going back for another try for sure! Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Absolutely ove this place.  My favorite Chinese restaurant in the NW.  Everyone that work there are amazing and so nice!!!  Highly recommend their combo's. A lot of quality food for a fair price."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to comfort food spot! Awesome service, awesome food ... and good prices. Love the weekday lunch specials. Crab Rangoons are addictive! Our standard family order always includes Orange Chicken, Crispy Orange Beef, and Mongolian BBQ. Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are also tasty. Great small local hole in the wall gem, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The staff was polite on the phone and delivery was fast but the food was horrible. Had the family dinner a and everything in the order tasted old. Nothing was fresh the crab ra goons were hard as a rock. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten all over town, by far this is my ultimate favorite Chinese food. They have great price for weekday lunch specials and their hot & sour soup is aaaawesoooome! There not a single dish that I have a complaint about, no kid. Also their fried rice are cheap and it's a huge order. The staff is great, say \"hi\" to Jenny for me. Try it, you won't regret finding this place."}
{"text":"Really good quick Chinese food fix.  I love the General Tso's chicken.  Enough for two meals."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery a couple times now.  The food is on time and fresh and hot!! We have tried multiple items off the menu. The mei fun is awesome.  The portions are huge especially for the price!  Overall, great taste and fresh food!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great fast food chinese place. 7.95 for a good portion combo of beef broccoli noodles and a wonton. Plenty of choices including great prices for sushi. Really job well done. Even my picky son goes hmm tasty."}
{"text":"Copious portions, fresh, savory and at fair and reasonable pricing! Mind you that we had to change our order from pick up to delivery (thank you Chop Chop Wok for making it hassle-free). We didn't eat our food upon delivery as we had to run out, but coming back to it a couple hours later it was DELICIOUS so I can only imagine had we dived in when it arrived.   We had General TSO Chicken (spicy) Chicken Chow Mien  Potstickers  Veggie Friend Rice"}
{"text":"$3 for a large chicken fried rice!  BTW, my favorite dish is the Curry Chicken, extra spicy.  First off, this is a GREAT neighborhood Chinese take out place.  This is not supposed to be the end-all, be-all of Chinese take out.  The quality is consistent (we all really want is predictability with our food, c'mon, admit it...) and good.  The protein dishes don't scrimp on the protein and the noodle dishes are done the way I think they should be done.  Since I mentioned the chicken fried rice at the start, I always order some when I order a main dish.    Kudos to Jenny who learned my name & phone voice after ordering 2 or 3 times.  She would do wonders for any business as their PR person.  What a memory for names & faces (and orders!).  Around dinner time, there are many patrons eating in the little restaurant and a constant stream of others, picking up their food.  For the money, I haven't yet found a place as good as Chop Chop Wok.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for this place!  Due to the Las Vegas summer heat killin' my brain, I'm gonna try to keep this one short today.    All I can say is...$2.99 special for an order of chicken fried rice!  Deal!  Yes, and this chicken fried rice from Chop Chop Wok is pretty killer.  So good!  Theirs has a genuine 'fried' taste to it and I'm pretty sure the chicken is marinated.  Goes great with a side of kim chee and an ice cold beer.  Complete meal!  Chop Chop Wok is located close to my home, and has some of the better Chinese food in my area.  This place is more for take out, so don't bring a party of 50 or more!  All they have for seating is several small tables and a few tables that sit between 4-6 people.  Chop Chop Wok is definitely a small Mom & Pop type joint.  And with just the one nice lady running the entire front area, it is such.  We all know these little hole-in-the-wall places can offer up some good eats!  The menu at Chop Chop Wok is a mix of Chinese and Japanese.  Everything from rice and noodles is available, even the usual suspects of Mongolian Beef, Egg Foo Young, and Kung Pao Chicken are there.  Chop Chop Wok goes above and beyond by also including some Japanese flair, sushi rolls are available as well as bentos!  There are weekday specials that start at $4.95, saving you some cash for your stash.  For that small amount of change you get soup, an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll.  Not bad!  They also offer combo plates for just south of $7.  You can get out of Chop Chop Wok with a fully belly and a still full wallet!  I'll have to be honest, I haven't tried much on the Chop Chop Wok menu.  Mainly because my usual stop is there for the $2.99 special chicken fried rice for a snack!  But I've seen many of the dishes come out of the kitchen for eat-in patrons and it does look fresh and tasty.  Nothing sitting in a buffet tray under a heat lamp!  I've heard folks eating here say that the food is pretty good, and the prices are good as well.  I promise to try more stuff here soon!  Until then the cheap chicken fried rice will be calling my name.  Chop Chop = Cheap Cheap"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of nights ago. Decided to dine in. They seemed pretty busy with take out and delivery and so the service was a little slow. The lady who worked there, owner?, was very friendly and the food was very good. I thought it was better than average American-Chinese places. Portions were big and they used lots of fresh vegetables.  Lately, I have seen some small local restaurants, that have only one person taking care of everything: answering the phone, taking take out orders, and acting as a server (bring out food, filling up drinks, etc.). I don't understand why they insist in offering service for dine-in. I wish they would opt out of that and let customers order at the register. That would make things so much easier and faster. In addition, customers wouldn't have to wait forever just for the menus to come out or to get a refill. Just an idea..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants for this area of Las Vegas. Fast service when you call in or sit in. The amount of food you get for your money is generous. Small sitting area inside restaurant and can be rather warm inside during the summer so I usually get it to go"}
{"text":"I have come in here a few times for a lunch special and was very pleased at the flavor and the portion size.  I have always taken the food to go but can say the place seemed tidy and comfortable enough while I waited at a table for my food to be prepared.  The other day, a neighbor told me, \"Chop Chop Wok is the best food and I have it delivered at least once a week to my house\".  As I was sitting around getting hungry, that thought came to me and I ordered away last night.  Delivery was great with large portions and for the right price too!  You can't go wrong with this place in my opinion.  A very nice choice which I think I will put into rotation a lot more often."}
{"text":"Had Saturday lunch at Chop Chop Wok.  They do not have the Lunch Specials on Saturday or Sunday, only the weekdays, but they still have the combo specials for $6.50.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it came with fried rice or lo mein, egg roll and ragoon.  I got the lo mein and the Kung Pao was great, lo mein really good and the ragoon was the best I have had.  I will be going back to try their curry chicken. They have a large menu, food was great and prices were lower than surrounding chinese food places."}
{"text":"It pains me to drop Chop Chop Wok a star but after what I saw in there the other night, I have no choice.  Quite simply put, I was worried while waiting for my food.  I did not notice when I first walked in that the place was filthy.  Half of the tables were unwashed.  One had a high chair that a baby had been sitting in and it showed.  There was food all over the place. Tables and floors alike.  Another table still had old dried up rice all over it and a wiping rag just sitting there.  Tables don't wipe themselves.  To top it off there was a man working on the beverage fridge.  Thats fine right?  Wrong.  He was crawling up underneath it and using an acetylene torch.  I could smell it every time he sparked it on and I could hear loud pops every time he turned it off.  It was crazy.  This flame in such a small area was getting very close to the 2-liter bottles stored back there.  It was kind of scary.  I thought the place was going to blow up.  It seems inappropriate to be using a torch during dinner hours and so close to the dining room.    As for the food, I ordered from the Japanese side for a change.  A chicken katsu bento box with white rice, a salad and fried shumai.  The shumai threw me.  I would expect gyoza in a bento box faster than I would shumai.  Don't get me wrong.  The shumai was fine.  Just not what I would expect.  The katsu was superbly crispy.  I with there was more of it.  And more of the sauce would have been nice too.  As for the salad.  The \"ice\" in the iceberg lettuce must have melted because that salad of nothing but iceberg lettuce was floating in a pool of water.  Luckily I did not go in there for a salad so I was not sorely disappointed.    I don't know if or when I will be back to Chop Chop Wok.  I do like there food more often than not but after what I saw while waiting 20+ minutes for take out, I'm not sure how they have an \"A\" rating.  I may give it some time and check them out at a later date.  I need to see if they drop a letter or two.  I do sincerely hope they clean up their act and restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Love the Chinese and sushi the best of both worlds!  We've been regulars on getting delivery for almost 3 years now and highly recommend to make this your go to spot.   Support local and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on food only. I ordered the chicken wings & combination chow fun. The wings are just plain, gross. Maybe the oil they were fried in was old? They had no seasoning, no flavor other than stale & old. The chow fun was edible, but I'd be lying if I said it was decent. The texture was fine, but it lacked so much flavor. I had to add a lot to it to bring myself to eat it & not feel like I wasted all of my money. Sorry guys. It's just not up to standards."}
{"text":"Not very pleased with my order- The chow fun was okay, but the General's chicken and the Poo Poo platter were extremely dry and over cooked. Some pieces were like dried out jerkey."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nearby Chinese restaurant - having gone through all the very local ones.  This is a little further than what we were looking for, but the food and the price made it worthwhile.  Everything we got was better than average (except the egg rolls - which were spring rolls, pretty good - but not egg rolls).  We ordered a large pork lo mein, a large chicken lo mein, a large Mongolian beef, a large General Tao's chicken, 1 order (of 3) egg rolls, 2 large war wonton soup.  The total bill was less than $50.  The lo mein was among the best I've had in Vegas.  Everything else was very good."}
{"text":"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip?  Regardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok. Reading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air. Man, did I have another thing coming. Chop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom. Which is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's.  We tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed.  We're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because you can't find good chinese food in Vegas.  This is by far the best out here.  The fried shrimp is something from california, the chow mein is awesome also."}
{"text":"So... I saw a picture of chicken fried rice on reddit and clearly that's a sign to find myself a Chinese place near work that I love. Here I am, giving this one a go thanks to the reviews on here!  They were pretty busy with taking call in orders but someone came out to help me with my order. There's a $5.00 minimum for credit card purchases which is fine. They have awesome lunch deal combos for $6.00 and can upgrade for $2.00  I ordered broccoli beef with chicken fried rice, egg drop soup, and crab ragoon. I was excited to dig in.   Food was slightly lacking in flavor but still delicious. I'm quite happy with my decision. Very filling. Hasn't upset my stomach yet, so there's that."}
{"text":"Didn't want to cook tonight so I ordered from Chop Chop Wok Las Vegas, just down the street from our place, and had sushi delivered! My husband and son were pleasently surprised that I found a place that actually delivered sushi. The Miso Soup was really good, and the Edamame appetizer portion was huge. 12 different types of maki rolls, using different combinations of Tuna, Salmon, Crab, Eel, Tempura Shrimp and Tobiko. Plus 4 different vegetarian rolls (one I had never had before, a scallion roll, YUM!). Two of the rolls were too spicy for me, but my husband enjoyed them very much, and one roll had the Tempura Shrimp with avacado, Crab, Eel, and Tobiko. Great meal, wonderful company, all while watching the Olympics Pairs Figure Skating then Women's Hockey. Will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future trying out their sashimi plates and some of their combo plates and speciality rolls."}
{"text":"I always come in for their lunch special. The food is exactly as I expect it and not overpriced like some of these places tend to do."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Chinese food. (Usually take out)  Their fried rice and lo mein is the best in town. The husband and wife owners are great! Always get our orders right!  If you're new in town, or a visitor who's tired of the Strip expensive Chinese food, punch this location into your GPS and get ready for a feast! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing...orange chicken with lo mein. Fairly decent prices for the amount of food you get. I noticed if you go right before they close they usually give you a bigger serving. I really like their crab rangoon. They give you two if you order the combo."}
{"text":"Good fast Chinese food what more could ya ask for ... I justwish I would of not for got to ask for dish to be spicy but besides that the food is tasty"}
{"text":"My new go to for Chinese food on my lunch break. For $6.00 (including tax), you can't beat the lunch special at this place. Distance is a bit far from my office, but it's conveniently located next to the Cheyenne exit, so from a time standpoint, I don't mind making the 10 minute drive each way.  I ordered the beef and broccoli lunch special. It came with soup (or you can substitute for a can of soda), fried rice, main entree, and egg roll (or you can substitute for a crab rangoon). The ratio of beef to broccoli was even. I'm used to places piling on the broccoli, leaving me with no beef. Not a problem here. Beef was very tender. Overall, the food was delicious.  Service was great. Drinks came immediately. My soup came instantly after that. Our food was at the table before I even had time to finish half of my soup. It was that quick."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. Small and old shopping mall area. Great prices and tasty food. They may not understand any question you have though."}
{"text":"We love Chop Chop Wok. We just moved back into this area after 3 years and were so happy this place was still here.They have the biggest portions and can feed the whole family with just a few selections. Along with leftovers for lunch the next day. They also have a good selection of sushi, my son loves the Godzilla roll. I love the avocado salad and my honey loves the beef fried rice and chicken core mein. I can't say enough about the portions and the flavors. If you're looking for a pleasant surprise check it out."}
{"text":"We always order delivery from here.  The service is prompt and nice and the food is great.  If the delivery is this good then I must stop by and dine in sometime.  Great food, great prices, great service.  Not your average Asian food spot."}
{"text":"When craving some Chinese food, this by far has the best selection & best tasting in the north side of town. The only time I didn't get a very nice service is when I went to go pick up the food instead of having it delivered, I was in the area and thought I'd stop by, so trying to find this place was kind of a puzzle, a definite (tiny) mom & pop place with few seats, phones ringing b2b, and cashier needing extra help for sure. I recommend calling instead of coming in.   Food is always consistent with ginormous shrimps, they weren't kidding when they said \"Jumbo\"!!! From fried rice, to the cashew shrimp, etc. they don't shy on giving you a great amount of food... \"Family dinner B\"? as the lady confirms every time I call (Miranda moment lol), just a nice family with a great food to offer! Thanks for your consistent awesomeness CCW!  Ordered Family B today, the usual beef broccoli and tried the Szechuan shrimp this time - unfortunately the Szechuan shrimp was awful."}
{"text":"I had never been to or ordered from Chop Chop, and was very impressed. Upon calling in my order, I was told that my Kung Pao chicken would be ready in 10 minutes. It was ready when I arrived, and the portion size blew me away.  The food was delicious, and at a very reasonable cost."}
{"text":"My wife called me and ask if I know any Chinese's restaurant on her way home from work. I looked in Yelp and found Chop Chop Wok. When she came home she had lots of good food to eat. She told me she order the family meal which was about $25.00. It came with soup, three main courses, rice and egg rolls. The food was really good the next time we are in the mood for Chinese's food we will head to Chop Chop Wok"}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious. At first looks I didn't want to go in small and no one was here at the time. Once we started eating alot of regulars came in. They knew the lady's name and she knew there's . Loved it. I got Mongolian Chicken with lo mein. It was bomb. My son got the Orange Chicken with fried rice it was also bomb. My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken witch was different from what we thought it was. But still not bad. I love love love this place."}
{"text":"Food is great and very affordable many different specials available for lunch and dinner. The service was AMAZING and I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I came here initially when I was in the area visiting a friend.  I had been looking for an American Chinese restaurant since moving to Vegas this past summer, and after trying about five other places, this has been by far the best. Now please be aware, this is not authentic Chinese food. If you are looking for that type of food, I would recommend taking a gander around Chinatown. What this is is phenomenal American Chinese food (think Panda Express-type food, but not sickening).   The past two times I've gone, I've ordered the lemon chicken, the pork and green beans, the beef and green beans, the moo shu pork, the fired rice, lo mein, crab rangoons, and the eggrolls. In my defense, a majority of the food is a part of the $7 combo special, which gives you SO MUCH FOOD. That's another thing: the prices are phenomenal, and the portions are so big! The pork in the sting bean combo was a bit dry, but the beef was so good. Like, the best American Chinese beef I've hand in a long time. Also, the string beans are so very good. Nice and crunchy, and covered with a delicious sauce. The pork fried rice that comes with the combo is also better than the lo mein, but the lo mein is also really good. The moo shu pork was also great, but I wish they would have given me more wrapers because they gave me so much of it even for the small (which was only $6).   The service was also really great. The service was attentive, and the place was really clean. Tiled floor to ceiling, but I'm not really expecting much from the decor of a strip-mall American Chinese place. That being said, the service review might be a little biased, since my friend and I were the only people actually sitting down in the restaurant, but other people came in and got take out, so they obviously thought the food was something to try.    If this is the kind of Chinese food you're looking for, I would definitely recommend Chop Chop Wok. While it is definitely not the best American Chinese food I've ever had (I grew up in Oakland, and went to college in LA), I personally think that it's the best I've had since moving to Vegas. Check it out, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BF and I took some food home after running errands in the area.   Plus that they do lunch specials, but also a special combo meal available all day of a dish + fried rice + eggroll and rangoon.   I got their mongolian beef which was pretty good. It was tender and the sauce was nice on it. The BF general tso didn't fare as well though. The sauce was rather thick, almost gelatinous so the texture was a put off for him and so he ate some of my food instead. The fried rice that came with it was decent and was not overly greasy, eggroll and rangoon was standard and crunchy even though it traveled home.   I would say like any take out, there is hit/miss but with these prices I'd say to give it a try and navigate some of the recommendations on other reviews."}
{"text":"Great Food they can even make dishes New York style.  Prices are great and big portions plus they have discount coupons for take out or eat in,  Ask for Tony as your waiter he will get your dish the way you want it abd without a long wait."}
{"text":"A very underrated small Chinese spot tucked in a strip mall. Seating and decor is pretty quaint. I decided to order the small House Fried rice and was pleased with their portion. It's served with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef! Also asked for chili oil on the side and they happily got some for me!"}
{"text":"I eat chinese a lot and whenever I am on business trip, I always try chinese.  Now this is what Chinese food should be! top notch! I tried their hot and sour and chicken with garlin sauce.  it is by far the best chicken with garlic sauce ever.  i am definitely going back there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious food. Curry Beef is great with just the right amount of spice. Crab Rangoon is a great starter. Try the pork fried rice. It's great, I promise. I will keep going back to Chop Chop Wok in the future. Probably next week"}
{"text":"Seriously, maybe the freshest Chinese/Japanese food I've ever had. The Japanese was good but holy hot damn the Chinese food is amazing. Me and my fiancee were in food coma for hours and it was worth it! Whether you like authentic or panda express, trust, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Took out from here. A typical neighborhood greasy American style Chinese take-out. Massive portions. Priced cheap. And you get what you pay for. Greasy, unhealthy type of take-out. Tastes good. Loaded with bad stuff. Filling and tasted good. Just not kind of food."}
{"text":"Looking for decent Chinese takeout?? You've found it here. The fried rice has always been good,  (I'm partial to the Chicken and Pork Fried Rice). Sweet and Sour Chicken, Cashew Chicken, BBQ Lo Mein, BBQ Pork Chop Suey, and Wor Won Ton Soup....all winners. The crab rang goons are pretty good too. Prices are good, and it's way better than Panda. The staff here is very friendly, and always working with smiles on their faces. The place is located at the back of the shopping center past Olive Garden, sitting next door to One Love Vapors.  I've learned that you have to take reviews with a grain of salt...like you do with everything else in life, and you can't always believe everything you read, so ultimately you have to take some risks...this place is worth it."}
{"text":"A+ !! Great friendly service! and my golly are the portions HUGE! and the price is RIGHT! lunch specials are super cheap and worth every penny spent. I am definitely a fan (:"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Chinese restaurants in vegas. The price, the food quality and portions are hard to beat."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FRESH FRIENDLY!!! Portions are huge! Easily a few meals from the main dishes. So happy we found this place. We ordered shrimp with broccoli, egg rolls, fried rice and lo Mein. We picked up and the lady was so nice and friendly. We are neighborhood fans! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to for Chinese, the crab rangoons are amazing! I haven't tried anything here I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese take out grub-a-dub-dub.  And they include duck sauce with your order!!  My friends and I were beginning to think this was an East coast phenomenon, as it isn't standard issue in Vegas.  They offer generous lunch specials that are also applicable to the take out menu.  Portion sizes are nice and the food is not as greasy as most take out Chinese.  To date I've only ordered take out, and all of my experiences have been fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this place so good. The restaurant itself was small, but the food was pretty good for the price. We had the salmon and an eel sushi box, while a friend of ours had the teriyaki shrimp. For an appetizer we had an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"A friend of ours introduced us to this restaurant less than 2 months ago and it has become a staple in our home. We order from there at least once a week or every other week, and on occasion 1-2 times a week. My wife is addicted to the Crab Cream Cheese Rangoons, and we both LOVE the Egg drop soup. She always gets the Chicken Fried rice, which is awesome both in price and taste. I do not really recommend the sweet/sour pork/chicken but it may be that I am just not a fan of that item at any Chinese place. The other reviewer on here described it right. We are actually going there for some take out tonight! The drivers and the lady that works the register and takes phone orders is super sweet and she knows my wife by face and voice, it's really welcoming to have that  with a restaurant."}
{"text":"Good 'ole Chop Chop Wok.  This little place is so cute and one of my favorite go to Chinese places when the urge hits.  Over the past probably 5 or 6 years I've eaten here/ ordered take out countless times.  Is it the world's healthiest? Probably not, but I don't eat it daily, so no big deal.  The employees are always friendly and am always greeted with a smile from Jenny (?) the nice cashier lady at the front.  Chicken fried rice: nicely cooked chicken chunks with some fried egg along with chopped veggies added in.  The rice was properly cooked and adds a nice addition to the meal.  General Tso Chicken: Being the major fan that I am, always ask for extra garlic and boy do they deliver. Found the chicken to be nicely breaded and tender with a strong punch of garlic.  Just like I love it!  Orange Beef: One of my only gripes is that it was kinda tough.  Required some additional chewing, but had a nice delicate orange flavor with some orange peel present.    This restaurant does provide a good value for your money.  Can't wait to try out some of their other offerings.  And the best part is that it's only about a mile from my house."}
{"text":"We have been going here for almost 3 years and they are always so nice! The owners knows us by name and always asks about our son. We order from here at least a couple times a month and its great every time. We usually get the Mongolian Beef or Chicken Broccoli. I love the Crab Rangoon's too! I definitely recommend this place for delicious, cheap priced Chinese food!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD for the money! Friendly service! Lunch special was $5.50 and I was may more than stuffed! :)"}
{"text":"Their food is alright, nothing spectacular but difficult for them to get my order correct. After ordering the third time and going over the order and them remaking it they still got it incorrect so I wouldn't return to this place."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was wonderful! Chicken skewers Szechuan beef and miso soup. Everything was hot and delicious. Prices are great for a lot of food. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"I have seen mixed reviews here on yelp. I must give 5 stars. I dined in. I ordered the lunch special Mongolian Beef. It came with soup. I had the hot and sour. For a lunch special it was a huge bowl. It was better than a lot of other places I have went to. The Mongolian Beef was excellent. It came with fried rice and an egg roll. And it surprisingly came out on a real plate not styrofoam. Amazing. It was only $5.95.  The staff was great. Super friendly. I believe they own it. You can usually tell the owners from the staff. It was a great experience and I will be back.  Oh BTW. It was the only lunch special I have not been able to finish. I had to take the rest to go. You will not believe how much food you get for the price."}
{"text":"We were on this side of town and craving Asian food. We found this place on yelp. The food and the service was great. The only reason why I gave 4 star was due to the fact it wasn't maintained well. It needs some paint and General Maintance to the front of the house. If we are every back in this area, we will return for sure."}
{"text":"Not that great ... Wonton soup is horrible along with the fried shrimp ... Spring rolls are   Decent and Szechuan chicken is ok.. The only good thing here was the Mongolian beef. Wanted to like this place but unfortunately won't return."}
{"text":"The Chinese food scene is really good in Las Vegas, but Karen and I have a favorite take-out joint and it's definitely Chop Chop Wok.  We probably order from here at least once a month, but probably a little more. In over 15-20 orders, they have never once screwed up an order and always get our custom orders correct. Recently we placed a take-out order on our way home from the airport. On takeout orders, give them a 15-minute head start when you want to pick your food up. We always order by phone and they are a great help and efficient.  On this order, we ordered a large portion of their General Tso's chicken. It's huge and we usually get 3 meals out of the chicken. The entree comes with white steamed rice, but for this order, we also purchased a small chicken fried rice. Their standard fried rice comes with your choice of meat, egg, onion, peas & carrots. I always get mine without the peas & carrots.  Karen is a huge fan of the hot & sour soup (with extra crispy noodles). This visit we got a small order.  All in all, for quick, tasty & great value in Chinese takeout, you should definitely stop in at this Northwest location."}
{"text":"Three words! Shrimp, Fried, Rice! Delicious! Highly recommend! I've never been so fond of any fried rice, but this rice is a winner. It is really good on its own, but I like to add a little bit of soy sauce on it, just my personal preference. Pot stickers and vegetable rolls are good too. Very happy customer."}
{"text":"So I decided to come try chop chop wok. This place was actually better than I anticipated. I ordered the mongolian beef. The beef was very flavorful and tad bit spicy. But spicy is always good in my book. The portion size for the price is good. The staff here is very nice and helpful in helping you decide if you have never been here before. I really didnt like that my mongolian beef had way to much onions and not much beef.  I give this place a solid 4 stars. I enjoyed my food but had to dig for my beef in a forest of onions and serrano peppers."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and found it to have very reasonable prices. Fresh sashimi. Very good service. This place isn't fancy, but it's a great value with good service."}
{"text":"This place is great! We usually get a few different entrees but always the house fried rice and the house noodles. The portions are great and the food is tasty! The best deal is chicken fried rice lunch special I think it's $5 and huge! It's best for to go, but you can eat in. Everyone there is nice."}
{"text":"They cater to gluten free. Which is an automatic 5 star for my mother in law. (Who eats here often) today was my first time. And the lady at the counter was so nice and friendly! And they have a coupon where if you spend $20 you get free egg rolls, spend $30 free crab rangoons, spend $40 and you get free dumplings."}
{"text":"The woman I spoke to on the phone was very sweet and our food was ready within 20 minutes. The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced! I will definitely order from here again :)"}
{"text":"This place is good and i have been going there for years. It just seems like they are changing. They are being cheap with the sauces and quantity and when you have a big order they would give you some stuff free. I just ordered over $100 worth of food, and i had to ask and only got 1 order of pot stickers.Then I ask for extra sauce and its like pulling teeth. I use to brag about that place, now i think its about time to move on."}
{"text":"The dinning area looks like a dump and appears more like the back of  a low class medical center(white medical style tiles) but dont let that scare you.  They are serving some great Chinese Food and even some above average Sushi.  We shared the Godzilla Roll and it was delicious.  Not a lot of rice filer and the spicy tuna was fresh and flavorful.  For my dinner I had the shrimp Lo Mien and asked for it to be a little spicy. It was awesome but could have used a few more shrimp and vegetables. Still think its in my top two or three for Lo Mien in Vegas  The daughter loved her beef broccoli and is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night.  If you live near by its worth the stop in."}
{"text":"I decided to go again at it.  I have a reason for only my 4 stars this time.  The order : hot and sour soup small $1.50, pan fried dumplings$4.95 ish and a order general tso chicken $ i think it was 5.95 and also they do carry 2 liter and can drinks for delivery I didn't know this before hand.   Hot and sour - great as always and one heck of a value at $1.50   Pan Fried Dumplings- really good I can taste a little ginger or something I couldn't point out but really good same with sauce.  General Tso' Chicken - always cooked to perfection however this time it was heavily garlic tasting I am Italian so I can handle garlic, but to some people that might be considered way tooo much. The first time I got it, it was amazing like this time it was crispy etc.. however just sightly overly garlic   I will be back and back even with this small thing, the food is always good here. I don't like recommending places off of one visit but this is a second time and the food quality is really great. And to correct my over stated dessert menu they do serve some type of donuts ? I am not sure what kind will probably try next time.   They should put on there website that they carry 2 liter or can products because there online menu at there website doesn't mention any drink products."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for the last yr the food is always great weather it's dine in carry out or delivery we get the chicken lo mein for our kids they love it my husband get beef/broccoli an the shrimp fried rice I get the spicy Mongolian chicken it's good but it's really not that spicy all are nice size portions an very reasonable with prices if you haven't tried this place it's a must try!"}
{"text":"I had soup which was very lightly filled with food and the beef, it tasted good but I left hungry."}
{"text":"I had shrimp fried rice that was so delicious and it really was enough for two servings. The woman that helped me is always so kind and remembers that I would come in from time to time for my mother. I wish I could recall her name. Very Nice people. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
