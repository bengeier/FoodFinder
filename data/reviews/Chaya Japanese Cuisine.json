{"text":"This review is only for their sushi, as I haven't tried their other dishes.  I ordered the deluxe sushi a la carte. I liked the variety (which I was paying for...$$$) but the fish was not fresh at all. For sashimi, I would go to Penn Ave Fish Co. instead.   I'd come back here to try their non-sushi dishes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this sushi restaurant. It reminded me in a good way of some of the places I miss from California. The menu was varied and interesting, and the sashimi was delicious, fresh, and perfectly cut. I got the larger plate of sashimi and it was very generously portioned.  It's expensive, yes, but I expect that with good quality fish outside of the west coast. I will be returning for special meals--it's a little too pricey to be my every week sushi joint.  Other comments about the wait time were accurate--definitely go early and have the whole party there.  The BYOB policy is annoying. We just decided to forego wine or sake rather than deal with paying to use a glass. In my opinion, places should either charge a corkage fee or be BYOB only--not do both.  Edited: Went back a second time with the parents and was not disappointed. Great sushi rolls! Simple ones tasted really good. The shrimp tempura was also excellent. The chicken katsu was so-so, so I recommend sticking to fish. This place is a little difficult for the non sushi-lover or non fish-lover, but I really enjoy it."}
{"text":"My favorite affordable sushi place in the city.  I love the people that work there (they are very friendly) and their new storefront (2032 Murray; just one block up the hill from their old location) is bigger and in better shape, making the atmosphere very pleasant.  I believe it is owned and run by a Japanese family, which is a rarity in Pittsburgh and results in high quality sushi.  I have been coming here for years and even though I've had a couple of not amazing meals for the most part everything has been everything I hoped.  Sushi is my comfort food and Chaya is the place I go for it."}
{"text":"Really good sushi And generly love the salmon teriyaki but tonite tried the shrimp teriyaki and it was not so good, the staff claims pre cooked shrimp is the normal  preparation but I would  not order it ever again if that is so"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new places for sushi. On my way through Squirrel Hill I'd passed Chaya several times, but as I'm usually there in the early afternoon and Chaya is dinner-only, I'd never had the opportunity to try their fare.   Most of the time I check websites before going somewhere, to get a feel of their menu and pricing, but this time I failed to do so. As soon as we were seated I picked up the menu and was a bit startled at the pricing. It's expensive, though not outrageous for quality sushi. I just felt bad that I'd dragged my boyfriend somewhere that was a bit too expensive for us at the moment, him being in school and me having lost my job to downsizing a few months ago. Still, we stayed put and decided to have dinner. I was impressed with the fact that they provided chopstick rests and a bottle of shichimi on each table.   Chaya's menu is standard sushi and classic Japanese. It's comfort food made with an eye for quality and detail. When not ordering a la carte, your meal includes an excellent mixed salad (mesclun greens, perhaps) with ginger dressing, a bowl of rich, heavy miso and three pieces of Japanese-style fried chicken thigh. By the time our entrees arrived I was already slightly full.   We ordered the sushi roll plate (salmon roll, tuna roll, California roll and an eel hand roll) and the negimaki. The California roll, usually the General Tso's of sushi, was excellent, as were the two other rolls and hand roll. Everything was plated nicely. The negimaki was perfect and the portion was decent, the beef and onions on a hot plate atop a bed of sprouts and garnished with broccoli.   This isn't the place I would direct people to if they aren't willing to pay for quality and atmosphere. It's a bit on the pricy side, and there are plenty of places in Pittsburgh that serve sushi at a much lower cost. However, the authenticity in both the food and arrangements is worth the price, even if I have to put it in the category of an occasional treat or celebration venue. Our meals, plus tip, were around $25-30 a piece, and we were choosing the less expensive options.  Alcohol is, apparently, BYOB only with appropriate corkage and glass fees.   Had I more disposable income, I'd have gone for the omakase. It's a shame I came to this place with so little cash."}
{"text":"I only came here once with a friend before I left Pittsburgh, but we had a great meal.  It's REALLY awkward if you have to wait, though -- there's a tiny narrow passageway and something like four chairs for people to wait to be seated.  The fried chicken (tiny little pieces of chicken, not KFC drumsticks) was surprising but delicious."}
{"text":"We went to Chaya at a raining evening. Not many people there. Great service. Nice and comfortable environment. Food is very authentic."}
{"text":"We love Chaya in Squirrel Hill on Murray. BYOB, so bring your own sake. I LOVE the toro aburi (seared fatty tuna). It was first recommended to me by the chef my first time there and now I always get it. :) They get their seafood from Japan and NYC. This is our \"go to\" place. Umi is also great, just quite a bit more expensive, and not necessarily \"better\", just more trendy/fancy. Avoid Nakama at all costs. Small- can be a long wait since there is only one person preparing the sushi."}
{"text":"OK... I don't know if it was just the night we went (a Wednesday night) or that we went kind of late (around 8:30) but this was literally the LEAST fresh fish I've ever seen used in sushi, in my life, ever. I can be pretty sensitive to smells/tastes, but my husband can eat just about anything. Still, even he didn't want to finish the salmon sushi/sashimi (which is usually our favorite). It was brown around the edges and had a very, very bad aftertaste that tasted how the Jersey Shore used to smell. I was legitimately worried we'd have food poisoning, because we did eat a few pieces due to hunger. Thankfully it seems we've avoided that, but needless to say, we will not be going back.   To try to end on a positive note, the food was not overly expensive and the waitresses were very nice. The restaurant looks okay on the inside as well. And, hmm... let's see... the green tea was great. But none of that makes up for serving old, rotten fish. :( I wanted to like this place SO BADLY. Oh well."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for sushi and traditional Japanese food. The atmosphere is like a traditional Japanese restaurant, kind of quiet, calming. The servers are very polite. Good sushi takes time to prepare so I'd recommend not coming here famished.  Good thing to note is traditional Japanese sushi is usually nigiri, not sushi rolls (which is more of an American thing). I would recommend only coming here for traditional Japanese items like nigiri, sashimi, udon, karage."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh.  It's small, so be early or be prepared for a wait to get a table.  Or, just order to go!  The service is hit or miss, but in general good.  I think most of my problem encounters have been when I have ordered to go.    The sushi is smazing, my personal fave - the spicy tuna hand roll.  And the prices are fairly reasonable.  I've had a lot on the menu, and can't say there is anything that I wouldn't recommend.  One of the major highlights of the sushi experience here is the freshly grated horseradish/wasabi.  It makes the experience totally different from the expected wasabi paste.  Please, just don't do what my mom did - not believing me in how the wasabi should be used (dip your sushi into the soy sauce that add some freshly grated horseradish onto your piece of suchi), she did what she normally does with wasabi - dumped it into her vat of soy sauce.  NOT a good idea - it washes out the flavor and don't expect the good stuff when asking for more wasabi.  They'll take one look, shake their head internally, and give you the cheap paste the next time round.    Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Really not that great.    We were there on a Saturday night, and it was quite busy.   The Sushi was edible, but really not that great.   Definitely not up to the rave reviews they're getting from most yelpers.  Their new location is a lot nicer than the last one, though."}
{"text":"There are only two sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh that are actually owned by Japanese people. Chaya is one of them. The other sushi restaurants are owned by Koreans, Chinese, etc. Does it make a difference? Hell yes.  I used to eat here at least once a week when I lived in Pittsburgh. The sushi is spectacular and fresh, but like any fresh ingredient, there were some occasions where I was disappointed with the quality. But only because it wasn't the BEST tasting on THAT particular day.   The wasabi is homemade unlike most restaurants that use a powder mix. Compared to other sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh, they have a greater selection of fresh fish including, Fatty Tuna (Toro) and live Uni if you're into that.  Don't worry, it doesn't wiggle. Instead, they crack open the sea urchin shell to reveal the yellow...uh, I dunno. I don't care for Uni.  The restaurant is super small and cozy which also means long wait times, particularly on weekends. You sometimes get the evil eye from the staff on those busy days, basically indicating that you should leave now so others can sit.   If your idea of sushi is fancy rolls and sauce, then I'd recommend Nakama instead. If you're into real sushi, I'd definitely come check this place out."}
{"text":"Yes, Chaya is unpretentious.  Servers are pleasant and the place itself is  comfortable - very authentically Japanese.  But I disagree about freshness.  Not the best.  We are still searching for Pittsburgh Sushi that is reliably fresh regardless of the day of the week.  I am tired of having sushi here and realizing the specials are only a venue to unload the oldest fish.  Special pricing should be a chance to try something new and different.  Instead, what we have run into here at every sushi place, bar none, so far, is an avenue for using specials to dump old fish and I resent it.  If you run specials, it should be because you have gotten shipment on an unusual buy, or gotten a good price on that particular fish, not because it's old and you need to get rid of it. So, yes - this place is OK - Kiku is more reliable for freshness, but neither is as good as the most reliable neighborhood joint in other cities - Chicago, New York, etc."}
{"text":"I pass by Chaya everyday on the way to work, but never had a chance to eat there until two weeks ago. The place is only open for dinner from Mon-Sat (don't people eat out on Sunday??!!).   We didn't get seated immediately because one of our friends hadn't arrived yet. When we told the waiter that she might not be coming, we still had to wait for another 15 minutes, although there were a few empty tables. I was kind of upset coz I was starving by then...   We ordered the sushi set (tuna, salmon, shrimp, fish egg) and soba. My friends ordered tempura and chicken teriyaki. Our waiter warned my friends about the chicken--they're free-range, so expect dryness (and they were dry!). The sushi was surprisingly good! I wouldn't say that they're the best sushi, but I enjoyed them. The soba was OK. The tempura was crunchy and not oily at all. The chicken teriyaki wasn't tasty at all--not because of the chicken, but the whole thing was tasteless. The sauce was very little and it didn't look appealing at all.   We had to wait for quite sometime for the food to arrive, but our waiter was kind and informative. I'll probably go there again if I crave for sushi... Otherwise, Murray Ave still has other gems."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive, but the flavor can be improved much. The salmon smells weird."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed.   We started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received.   Misoshiru was very under-salted.   My unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.  My fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.  Why does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion.   Ideally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back.   We've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places.   Disappointed. :(  Good points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."}
{"text":"Chaya is a great Japanese restaurant that provides conscientious service in an intimate little setting. I heard about this place from Japanese friends who opined that this was the place to go when they miss home.   If you are looking to splurge a little and are adventurous, I highly recommend the omakase, which requires a minimum of two heads and two days notice. We received about 9 courses, with soups, stews, sauteed mushrooms/vegetables and an assortment of seafood. The Chef will not let you down, and you'll get the opportunity to try items you may not otherwise get to experience.   The service staff have been the same for years and provide great attentive service without being intrusive. They refill your green tea constantly, take away your plates and serve you with the next item with perfect timing.  Parking on Murray can be tough at times, but there are usually plenty of parking opportunities on the side streets if you are willing to walk a little. BYOB."}
{"text":"You can't tell the difference between food here and food in Japan, bottom line. An authentic Pittsburgh Best Eatery."}
{"text":"Have visited this place twice already and it only gets better! The sushi deluxe and sushi boat are well worth their price, and if you get fresh uni on a good day, it is better than most places I've had it, including several NYC restaurants.  The interesting thing about Chaya is that it's one of the only places in PGH that uses real wasabi. Very authentic Japanese sushi and a wide selection of sushi and rolls and well worth a visit. Will done here again!"}
{"text":"As far as sushi in Pittsburgh goes, it's ok. Fresher than other places, but nothing amazing. It is super tiny but I didn't have to wait long for a table of two. I ordered the sushi roll dinner combo which came with soup, salad, tuna roll, salmon roll and California roll. I asked for the tuna roll to be spicy, which they easily accommodated without a problem, but it was not spicy.  There was barely any hint of spice. Overall all the rolls were decent and I'd go back because the price was right and there aren't many sushi options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Chaya will always have a special place in my culinary heart as the restaurant where I first met my favorite maki -- umeboshi jelly + shiso leaf.  That said, if I'm heading out to eat in Squirell Hill, it is not at the top of my list. The prices make it a special outing, and over my many visits I've had a few dishes that were just not to my liking."}
{"text":"I come from NY so I have had some good Japanese food. This will be the closest Pittsburgh will ever get to it, and yet something about it just turns me off. It's not the best I've ever had, and yet they charge you as if it is. Maybe the reason I hate this place so damn much is because they're just unnecessarily expensive."}
{"text":"Chaya is a lot of fun; definitely the best place in Pittsburgh to get adventurous with sushi.  I've had better sushi for sure, but not around these parts.  Weirdly, one of my favorite things there is the fried chicken that accompanies every dinner.  Its golden-fried goodness is the perfect start to an otherwise raw meal.   The place is small, so try to go early for dinner.  I wouldn't go in a group larger than four, either, or you might wait for a very long time."}
{"text":"The BEST Japanese food in Pittsburgh :) The sushi is flown in fresh from Japan, and it is a Japanese place actually owned by Japanese. All of their dishes are delicious and traditional, and you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The servers are all extremely friendly and service is great! It's a small place, so make sure you go their early for dinner or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"2 people, one bottle of wine (that we brought), 2 soups, an appetizer and 4 rolls. Only $40! Excellent bang for your buck and a great place to chat with friends. We went on a Tuesday and got seated immediately. Not sure how busy it is on the weekends but we had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Chaya is the real deal. The restaurant is literally a work of art--the owner is the chef and he crafted much of the interior himself. His attention to detail is second to none, and this is reflected in the food and the service. I don't see how you can be disappointed in Chaya, unless you were expecting something other than what it is. I do wish they had a liquor license, but BYOB is actually more affordable. Speaking of, Chaya is surprisingly reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant!  While so many restaurants have opened in Squirrel Hill, and many of them have gone down hill, Chaya has maintained their quality over the 10+ years that they've graced the neighborhood.  The sushi is extremely fresh, and they have many options that you wouldn't find at other local sushi spots.  The entrees are all spot on, fresh, and tasty!  The broiled fish is one of our favorites!  There is nothing there that we haven't loved.  Great menu, fresh ingredients, prepared perfectly.  The lack of 5 stars is because the servers aren't always very polite.  A must visit restaurant in Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"I go to Chaya when I want awesome sushi. The reason it's the best is that it's affordable and the fish is amazing. The bites are small, the quality is consistent, and the service is good.  This is not the place for flashy dates or inventive ingredient combinations, and it may be lost on sushi beginners who've yet to learn to appreciate sashimi. It is the place for a cozy, special date where you savor the flavors and order the toro."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've had sushi in Pittsburgh so I can't comment on how good the food is in comparison to other sushi bars in the city, but generally, as a sushi place, Chaya is just okay. The prices were inconsistent, with some rolls costing $4 and others $14 and nothing in between. How is it that an eel roll costs $4, while a dragon rolls costs $14 when it is defined as \"thinly sliced avocado on top of eel roll?\" Maybe the roll is 3x the size of the eel roll? I don't know. Also, the tempura udon was a rip-off at $13 a la carte.  I guess I would've let these things slide if I weren't so dissatisfied with their service. At the end of our meal, we had a couple cookies from the bakery next door (Allegro Hearth--highly recommended) and the server told us that outside food is not allowed and that they would be charging us $2/person for bringing it in. WTF? I understand their policy on no outside food, but how about a warning? And this isn't even like we brought in our own wine or a cake that they had to slice for us. We each had half of a cookie and it ended up costing our table the amount of 2 sushi rolls. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been to Chaya a couple of times, and each time has been impressive. Great for small groups, this BYOB serves some great sushi along with the fried chicken that everyone else is mentioning. If you're looking for Japanese food in the Pittsburgh Area, don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I used to love love this place. Something is feeling a little off these days. I hope it's just not me. The sushis are as good as it gets. In my last visit, I got a toro (nigiri) and was quite disappointed. It was a thin slice of not so fresh toro for the same price that I paid for a fat piece of toro at an upscale place in DC. Really Chaya? Other than that, it is good. Highly recommend staying away from the \"fancy\" rolls. Devote the space in your tummy for the simpler stuff. Chaya does that really really well. My Japanese friend is a fan of Chaya. That feedback means a lot!"}
{"text":"Ok- so I tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and unfortunately had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life!  We went on a Friday night, so it was busy- not sure why?! The service was insanely slow- beyond ridiculous. So brutal.  Also, there looked like there was only one Sushi chef on a busy Friday night. The sushi and sashimi were well below average, both not smelling or tasting freshly.  Also, it wasn't a \"cheap\" place. All and all I was thoroughly disappointed with the ridiculously slow service as well as the sub par food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This was NOT good quality sushi! The toro was so old it was turning gray, did they think I wouldn't notice? I get that toro is seasonal, so if you can't get good quality, just take it off the menu. Even the regular plain old maki rolls were so bad -- stale crusty rice and dry fish -- I couldn't eat them. I can't believe this place is rated so highly."}
{"text":"Absolutely a big NO from us. Service is terrible. They don't have high chairs for toddlers or even a booster seat. They can keep there stupid fancy sushi rolls and udon soup. I would never recommend this place to families."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but was underwhelmed each time. People kept telling me it was the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and that's just wrong (that'd be Umi). The sushi itself was fine, but nothing special.  However, they do have a big variety of genuinely traditional Japanese food. So it's useful to go for udon, etc."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  It had great potential and a wonderful looking large menu, but almost every dish had a problem.  Toro was tender, but didnt see any marbling and it had an odd color and tasted fishy.  The miso soup had no flavor, it was a step above water.  The house salad was fine and I am told the gyoza were good.  The complimentary fried chicken was fatty but not in a good way and had no flavor except for oil.  The tempura was okay, a moderately light coating, but could have been lighter and the vegetables were all over-cooked, like they had been pre-cooked.  The chicken in the Don dish was overcooked and dry and the sauce was barely present with no dipping sauce for the tempura so it was a very dry dish.  Another persons tempura dipping sauce that I did try had no flavor.  The staff were all nice and quickly reactive, but not very proactive."}
{"text":"Credit for a staff that tries hard, but Squirrel Hill deserves a decent sushi store and this isn't it. I've tried a number of times and the product is only passable. Tonight I gave it one last shot with a carry-out order for visiting family when I didn't have time to travel to my preferred sushi destinations in Shadyside or on the South Side. Big mistake. They had a single sushi chef for the house. My promised 25-minute wait (absurdly long to begin with) became nearly 40 minutes. This store has so much potential, beginning with the location, but it's pretty clear the owners are willing to skimp (including on the wasabi portion). It would be tolerable if the product were special but it just isn't."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sashimi. Very cozy and be prepared to wait. The wait staff can be quite charming if you prove yourself. Don't be a newb by mixing your wasabi into your soy sauce."}
{"text":"Over all, it was a bad dinner experience. Food there is very mediocre, while the portion is by no means in propotion to the price.   I was very disappointed at the first sight of the beef Udon. It was just so different from what I imagined it to be. Honestly, for the same noodle soup, Ka Mei's is better with half price.   The tempura was nice, but as I mentioned, the food was over priced.   It was my first time dining there, would be the LAST one for sure."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh, the service was great, it felt like a genuine restaurant from Japan. Whenever I went, there was always a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"IMO this is the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is Japanese owned, authentic and has good traditional sushi dishes. Super sushi deluxe is always my go-to dish. You get the best and rare fish/seafood - uni, scallop, raw shrimp, high grade tuna, etc. The dish may sound expensive ($30+), but considering the ingredients that come with it, it is worth the money. Only four stars because I have been to better ones in NYC and Seattle, but it is certainly the best IMO in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh on business and chose two Japanese restaurants that sounded good according to reviews. Before I give my review I just want to talk about reviews I have read. Most bad reviews seem to be about expense. Most good reviews are about really good food. I was looking for good Japanese comfort food including good sushi. The menu I found on line had some of my favorites such as shishamo, ika natto, maguro no yamakake, moro-Q, so I knew this was a Japanese run restaurant. I only had the chance to go to one and this was a gem. I understand they recently moved to a larger space. It was still full - a good sign. It is BYOB and the odd part there was a charge of $2 to rent an empty glass for sake or beer and $4.50 to rent an ice bucket. I had never seen this anywhere and considered it odd. Since my total bill was well over $200 just for food, these rental fees were a bit annoying. The only other \"bad\" thing may be just a personal opinion. There was a slight odor of grease in the air from fryers, which is still on my clothes and jacket this morning. I don't like that, but it has nothing to do with whether the food is good or not. I think they need some different ventilation.  The service was also great - very attentive and helpful. They all worked as a team, so several came by to see if we needed anything or to make suggestions. Finally, the food was excellent, just as I remember from all of my trips to Japan. The uni was truly fresh and was either California or Japan imported, since it was so sweet.  They didn't have another favorite (ika shiokara), but had a similar dish using baby (3\") whole squid. Just as delicious! The nigiri rice was perfectly formed and the nigiri were the correct/perfect size and all the fish was very delicious. The sauces were perfect (Japanese style to enhance flavors - not overpowering to hide flavors as is found in so many lesser quality restaurants). The hamachi kama was also wonderful.  Even the wasabi was real wasabi, not the powdered kind. That was a real treat. If I really like a place I would try to sit at the sushi bar next and the sushi chef appears to have lots of personality. That also means the sushi bar was totally full. Perhaps I'll have a chance next visit. If I am back in Pittsburgh, you can be sure I will go there again!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I should've listened to the other reviewers. There's definitely something strange about the way they run their business. To all the families out there with children - they will make it difficult for you.  I called before going because we have 4 young children. I asked if it would be busy around 6:30pm because we will have a party of 6. The person over the phone said, \"Probably not because it's still early - but no guarantees.\"   Upon arrival, I noticed there were couple 4-tops and a couple 2-tops open, so it wasn't packed. No one else was waiting. The first hostess said that it would 10-15 min to seat us - no problem we thought... then soon after, another hostess (who has a particularly loud voice) - said that she could seat us at a 4 top (for the 6 of us). Mind you, there were already two larger groups there eating with tables to accommodate them (4top pushed together with a 2-top). We said we'd wait for one of the larger tables to open up. The hostess with the loud voice seemed incredibly annoyed, still trying to sell us on the 4 top - saying that people may eat slowly and she can't predict when they will get up. We didn't mind the wait and still held our position and said, we'd like to wait for a larger table. She AGAIN approaches us a minute later, saying \"we don't have high chairs or booster chairs...\" We said it's okay... Then she tries to sell us on the 4 top again. I'm not kidding you, she came  back to us another 3 times, trying to push us to squeeze into a 4 top. It was almost as if we were inconveniencing her by wanting to eat at the restaurant and she was presenting the situation as \"If you want to eat here, you have to hold your baby, and squeeze the rest of you on this small 4 top...\"  About 10 minutes go by, and a table of 4 get up. Perfect set up for us 4top + a 2 top right next to it, to push together. The hostess with the loud voice refused to seat us there. She wanted to squeeze us onto the very 4 top she tried to sell us on the minute we got there. She said it's a \"Friday night\"... Basically saying, she wanted to keep those tables open for others that MAY come. There wasn't anyone else waiting!  My husband flat out asked her, \"Do you not want us to eat here?\"  That's how flabbergasted he was. He then asked for the manager - which of course, she was... We decided to leave and give someone else our business. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  As we were outside of the restaurant figuring out where to eat, I decided to go back in and ask for the owner. When I walked in, I saw her talking to the sushi chef in the back. When she walked by, I asked her who the owner was because I wanted to talk to him/her - and she pointed to the sushi chef and she said reluctantly, \"He said we can push the those tables together...\" WHAT THE?!!! I looked at her... blinked a couple times... and walked out.  My husband and I believe that we were not seated because we had 4 kids, instead of 4 adults. That means, to take up those seats, the manager didn't think we'd ring a up a high enough bill - because kids typically do not eat as much as adults. There were two other larger groups there, with adults - one table holding a baby... why were we not treated the same?   Lastly: WHAT RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE HIGHCHAIRS??? Some of the most upscale restaurants we've been to have excess number of highchairs and booster seats. CHAYA, it's just sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in all of Pittsburgh. Don't expect anything but a traditional, finely tuned Japanese restaurant. Have never had a bad meal here, and I feel this is the best prepared sushi plate in the area.  This is not a place for large groups, however. I have had a couple of birthday dinners here, and they do not cater well to parties over eight, and generally do not like young kids. I cannot hold this against them, because they want to keep a nice atmosphere... and like I said the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I went again recently, since there's now very few alternatives that offer quite the same selection (since Tokyo Sushi Buffet closed). This time, I got the deluxe sushi and chirashi bowl. Once again, they were simply okay at best, no better than any other similar restaurants outside of Pittsburgh and notably pricier (almost twice as expensive as comparable offerings at other places I've been to outside Pittsburgh). Atmosphere was still suffocating. I don't think I'll come back, even if I was absolutely craving sushi. I'd just drive down two hundred miles to Mr. Sato's and pay literally the same price - fuel and trip included! - for more and better sushi."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  The customer service is awful.  The waitstaff rushes you out the door within minutes of you paying.  In no way is the food worth the terrible experience.  There are far better restaurants in Pittsburgh, which don't take reservations, that don't tell you to leave as soon as you pay (e.g., Point Brugge).    If you want good sushi, go down to Kiku in Station Square.  Don't waste your time and money at Chaya."}
{"text":"The food is fine. Nothing special but good by Pittsburgh standards. The service is very slow. You will often be forced to wait to be seated for over 30 minutes even if tables are open."}
{"text":"The seared tuna nigiri was excellent.  I'd love to return and try more of menu items, as a number of them looked delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good and fresh but the wait was pretty long. Too expensive to come often but it was definitely a nice change from school quality sushi. They played children Japanese songs which made it hard to keep a straight face!"}
{"text":"I came here after reading the reviews. The decor is authentic and impressive. I also liked the size of the restaurant- it was cozy, relaxing without being too packed, even on a busy night.   Highlights:  THE FOOD- I've had sushi in NY and other major metro areas. This is among the top of my list as far as variety and quality. They have a huge nigiri menu, so definitely check it out if you're in the mood for fresh fish as I was.  The green tea - not the $.50 tea bags that other restaurants try to pass off. Good, authentic matcha powder in a delicate cup. Definitely recommended.  Areas of improvement:  Service could've been better. My cup of tea was refilled once, and the restaurant wasn't super packed.   However, they made a minor error for one of my orders and fixed it immediately- I didn't even have to have that awkward conversation. So- definitely check this place out. Plus, the bus literally stops right in front of it."}
{"text":"I agree with Chuck S.   Chaya is absolutely the best Japanese restaurant that I've found in Pittsburgh.  The place is really small and cozy so that it doesn't feel like you're in a chain restaurant.  The service is excellent, quick and friendly.    Oh, and the sushi is amazing.  The amount of rice that the chef uses is perfectly balanced with the size of the fish.  It's not a bloated rice ball with a small piece of fish.  The rice was perfectly packed so that it was solid, but airy enough to come apart easily when you bit into the nigiri sushi.  The rice was not too vinegary as I've found in a lot of the sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh.   Also, the menu is quite authentic and has many choices that you wouldn't see at the majority of restaurants in Pittsburgh.  They have onigiri balls, nabemono and much more.    Expect to wait a bit if you go at peak times.  It is a small place that has about 8 tables and a sushi bar that fits 4 people.  However, it is definitely worth the wait.  Also, the BYOB is great allowing you to bring in your favorite beverage.  Corkage is $2 per glass for wine and beer I believe.    Prices are very reasonable.  For two people, it cost me about $50 with the tax included.  We were able to get the deluxe sushi dinner and the sashimi dinner combo.  The dinner combos came with your choice of edamame or fried chicken (common bar food in Tokyo) plus salad and tsukemono.  You would be paying the same prices at another sushi restaurant on Walnut or in the Waterfront and the fish is not as fresh or delicious."}
{"text":"As a fan of the Japanese language and culture, this place was very good.  I've been numerous times, and every time I am always, always satisfied.  True Japanese Sushi Chef, waitresses, environment, etc.. I'd say the only drawback, if you have limited patience, is that their english is not always very well -- but they are incredibly friendly and you can't help but truly feel like you are a foreigner visitng their incredible establishment.  Hand's down my favorite sushi spot in Pittsburgh, with Kiku being a close second -- everywhere else is a nice Americanized gimmick, but this is the real deal.  In the words of Amy S (who posted on 4/1/2011): I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE!   But I had to add an exclamation point at the end... ;)"}
{"text":"Chaya is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. While the sushi is obviously a big draw, the other appeal is the great selection of traditional Japanese food.  It's the only place I've found that actually has natto (fermented soybeans) on the menu. Other great selections:  the delicious udon, the vegetable tempura, and the marinated octopus (tako). Plus, all the waitresses wear kimonos and speak Japanese!  It's the closest you'll come to a taste of Japan in Pittsburgh! ^_^"}
{"text":"While having a not-so-great meal nearby in January, my friend mentioned that just around the corner, we could have had much better karaage and better food for a similar value. I just had to come the first chance I got, which unfortunately wasn't until ... 8 months later!  The restaurant is brightly lit (YAY!) and looks super traditional and Japanese, and so do the servers in their traditional clothing. Love the atmosphere.   The Chaya special combination dinners for 2 are absolutely the best value I've seen in the city. For ~$20 each, my friend and I sampled a variety of delicious food.  1. Salad. Delicious ginger dressing, fresh vegetables, well dressed. 2. Sushi - a 6-pc california roll to split and 4 pieces of assorted nigiri each, all fresh, good quality pieces. They weren't assembled very well (ie rice fell apart when picked up) and the vinegar was lacking, and the fish wasn't pressed properly, so they should probably hire a new sushi chef, but this is the best quality fish I've had in pittsburgh so far. 3. 3 pcs of karaage - absolutely perfectly marinated and fried, super flavorful and very juicy. Definitely lived up to their hype. They didn't come with sauce though... but they were good enough on their own. 4. The final soup took a while to come, but I was surprised our crab soup actually came with a whole snow crab (for the entire set for $40, I expected a few pieces of canned meat at best), and bunches of veggies and udon.   Service was great - very prompt and friendly, and patient with our indecisiveness.  We dug into our first bowls, sipped the delicious soup, only to find a hair wrapped around a tofu in the soup.... It wasn't a big deal, but they handled it amazingly and made me like the place a lot more.  For sushi, the individual pieces are a little pricey (though justified by the quality). But the service and atmosphere and the combination deals definitely make me a fan."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Chaya is extremely good, decent prices and an hidden gem in Squirrel Hill.  This is my default go-to place for sushi.  Even better these days since they moved - however the secret is getting out and there is sometimes a short wait to get in.  The waif-staff is always very nice.  Orders come out at typical speed for a sushi bar.  You'll wait a little longer when they are busy.  Rolls are a perfect size - not to big, not too small.  Sashimi is a good sized too.    Japanese food is quite excellent as well.  I always have a hard time decided what to get here.  My only complain with Chaya has been with their ventilation systems lately.  You don't notice it too much while you are there, but when you leave you smell like you have been working their all night.  They need to get that looked at!  EDIT: Spelling"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mix Roll and the Alaska Roll here. The sushi itself was sort of warm..? Warmer than room temperature. So it was kind of uncomfortable to eat. But the raw fish tastes fresh and didn't smell fishy.   The service was a little all over the place. Two servers kept getting confused and would ask us the same questions. The interior seems like a friendly Japanese environment.   If you want to order something other than sushi rolls, you'd definitely need a bigger budget than a college student."}
{"text":"This place is consistently very high quality.  It has helped my 8-year-old decide that sushi is his favorite food.  Chaya is a favorite with everyone in my family, although we usually get the carry out."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when I tried their broiled cod dinner.  It was flavored perfectly and although the portion was adequate I was hungry for more.  I went back the other night to try their sushi and their snow crab hot pot which were delicious as well.  There were a few sublime mouthfuls in the meal that justify the price and also the effort it takes to free crab meat from its shell.  Chaya seems like the most authentic Japanese place in Pittsburgh and I love the cozy small restaurant feel it has to it.  I see myself being a regular here and wish I had found out about the place sooner.  The dinners may seem expensive but are worth it as they provide soup salad and fried chicken with the meal as well for a slightly higher price.  The wasabi they use here is of a higher quality and is just another signal that the restaurant focuses on authenticity and quality.  Its only open for dinner but still I'd like to try their entire menu!  I hope to go sometime to get the sushi boat they have for 3 or more people or the kiseiki dinner for which you have to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Good authentic japenese food. I always go for chirashi bowl to rate a place and it did not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best for value places to get sushi in the city, and I'm talking the more authentic kind! I got the sushi and sashimi combo platters to share with a date and it was more than enough food!  Also the place is BYOB, go to wine and spirits next door to grab a bottle of wine or sake!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I lived in Japan for three years, and every time I am missing Japan, I go eat at Chaya.   In traditional Japanese style, customer service is top notch. Every server I've had also speaks Japanese, which is a plus for me. Most other Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh have servers that don't speak the language.  They do have rolls at Chaya if thats what you are looking for... Generally, when I ate out in Japan the sushi was one ingredient sushi so that's what I am used to. None of this fancy California Roll business.... that's not traditional Japanese food =D  I only wish they would open for lunch hours!"}
{"text":"Chaya is, by a significant margin, the best and most authentic Japanese food in squirrel hill. The prices are a tad expensive, and the quality of the seafood does not reach the standards of coastal cities, but there is nowhere else in a radius of 5 km where you can experience sushi of this quality. The deluxe chirashi for example is loaded full of fresh fish that was mostly satisfactory although the ikura was a bit oddly colored and suspicious in texture. I'm not sure if it ought to command the price of $35 but it satisfied a deep craving for quality seafood that I had been harboring for days."}
{"text":"My go to Japanese restaurant in Squirrel hill of Pittsburgh when craving vegetable tempura or vegetarian sushi dinner meals, even Inari.  I appreciate their vegetarian options.  I love their pre course miso soup and flavorful dressing in the house salad or even side of edamame, whether dining in or take out.  We have also sampled the teriyaki chicken dinner, which was thoroughly enjoyed.  Their decor suits the restaurant with appreciation for Japanese culture.  If you order the tempura, you'll find an origami shaped crane as part of your plating."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!  Pricey, but worth it.  Fresh fish - the toro is to die for.  The dinners have not only your usual miso soup, salad, and rice combo that comes with bento boxes, but also chicken kaarage (fried chicken).  Very small, so be prepared to wait.  I can't wait to come back as a regular."}
{"text":"This isn't just the best sushi in Pittsburgh, it's the best representation of Japanese food, period.  Not only do they get the food right, the ambiance is spot on as well. I stayed in Japan for a month and the atmosphere absolutely reeks of Japanese sensibility. Slightly cramped and personal but not too personal.  The sushi is divine and it's been described a million times before me. Each piece is a perfect cut and perfectly constructed. The temperature is just below room temp so it melts in your mouth. The ingredients are some of the freshest in the city.  Don't just go for the sushi. Try some of the other dishes, you might be surprised and like them. The inclusion of fried chicken, while seemingly odd, is an accurate accoutrement in Japan.  Love it, love it, love it.  Lookit my review for more. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/17/rodzilla-reviews-chaya/"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had so far in the area.  I am still learning the ropes, but this is authentic stuff.  An authentic decor, authentic staff, and authentic sushi.  It was very very good and the rolls are creative."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great, and I would even pick it over the way more expensive Umi. The rolls are pretty inexpensive, and they sell nigiri by the boat, so come with friends!   I've had great luck with their scallop, salmon, and shrimp, but was a bit disappointed with the toro every time.   They won't seat you until your whole party is there. They tend to get pretty busy and have a difficult time accomodating large groups."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi - overall one of the two best Japanese restaurants I've ever been to.  (Not that I'm a huge Japanophile, but I thought their salad and fried chicken were incredible, and I know this is patronizing, but I appreciated being in a Japanese place that's run by actual Japanese.)  Dining room is extremely cozy (meaning very small), so I wouldn't hit it if I want an intimate dinner, but it's a great place for a casual meal with awesome food.  I'll be back soon for non-sushi dinner, and I'm highly confident that it will be good."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food, fresh fish. Very small and can be difficult to get a table, I recommend going right when it opens.   One time, we were served a small plate of fried fish head + tail after our meal, compliments of the chef."}
{"text":"I would admit that this is probably the only Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh that offers a more traditional, non-Americanized Japanese cuisine.  However, for their price (15-20$), the quality is sub-par at best.    I believe they are most known for their sushi, oft used in japanese society meetings - which i found them fine.  Their fried items (tonkatsu, tempura) seemed too oily - likely a result of reusing the same oil, the rice too dry (kiss of death for me for any japanese eatery) and the miso shiru too salty.  For a price around 20$... It is unacceptable.  In Japan, Chaya quality would be par with cafeteria food.  Would you seem justified in paying 20$?  Unless you are dying for sushi, I would recommend going to Kiku for a similar price range (may be slightly more expensive)."}
{"text":"this is the best sushi restaurant in pgh.  i have been to japan and have been eating at this restaurant for over a decade.  if you want american sushi look else where.  if you're looking for quality authentic sushi, come here.  they have so many unique items that are often overlooked by the more commonly known items.  if you want something really special order the omakase or kasei which is a multiple course meal changes every night and is specially prepared."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times since the place is quite expensive for the quality of food, but I do love the interior. It's got a pretty traditional Japanese vibe that not a lot of other places in Pittsburgh have. I've had the teriyaki salmon, broiled salmon, fried chicken and fried tofu at Chaya.   The fried tofu had a good texture but the sauce was quite different from the typical agedashi tofu sauce i'm used to. It was a bit more on the ginger side. The plating was adorable though.  (I didn't photograph our actual order of fired chicken only the 3 pieces that came with the The texture of the fried chicken was actually quite good, especially with the lime to cut the oiliness but there was no dipping sauce! :( In california, I'm pretty sure every place I've had karaage has some kind of mayo based dipping sauce that really completes it.   I barely remember the salmon it was well cooked with some nice crispy parts and was pretty soft but there was barely any flavor to it in my opinion.  Being from California, I was raised used to eating at a lot of Japanese places so my opinion might be a bit harsher! I've got to say Chaya has the environment down, but the food was overall pretty bland and overpriced. However, I still give it a good rating just since there aren't many other places in Pittsburgh like it and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"When I was going to school in Oakland, this was THE place my friends and I treated ourselves to after a really rough week. Love the dinner specials! I always get the salmon lovers.  It's a little on the more expensive side, but definitely worth it for occasions!"}
{"text":"Chaya serves fresh, straightforward, affordable sushi--and it's BYO! I love BYO restaurants, and Chaya makes it easy, with only a small surcharge for the glassware. All the sushi staples are here, like spicy tuna and avocado rolls, ginger-dressed salads and miso soup; we enjoyed all that we sampled, and I'm sure I'll come back on my next visit into town."}
{"text":"We just love this tiny hole in the wall sushi place. The interior is very homely and has a good atmosphere.  When you order any of the meals, which they have a good selection of and is very authentic, there is always a starting salad with japanese ginger dressing which is excellent, a piece of fried chicken that is succulent and also a small bowl of miso soup that is just the right flavor.  The sushi here is always fairly fresh and they carry some of the harder to find fish such as fatty tuna.  The only negative we find with this restaurant is the small seating capacity and combined with the popularity and lack of the ability to make reservations, sometimes it is a long wait.  If you want good Japanese food in Pittsburgh, definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Great food. Had the combo tempora and several rolls. Large portion. High quality. Very authentic. Our son was really craving sushi; we're glad we came here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was fine but the food was very run of the mill and the prices were outrageous.   Just really bland and basic entrees.  Also, I don't get the idea of serving fried chicken nuggets as a side with most meals.   I had the Salmon Deluxe Sushi and Sashimi platter. The maki were very plain and had an odd crunchines to them. The nigiri and sashimi wasn't terrible but the taste and texture didn't impress like good fish should."}
{"text":"This place is very popular, so you will have to wait if you arrive at peak dinner hours.  The sushi was good and the prices are fair.  The sushi to rice ratio was slightly generous.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday night with a group of 6; we had sushi, tempura, and the fried chicken app. I was overall disappointed, they were out of most of the items we wanted to order, and the rolls were very basic, unless you wanted to pay $18 for a rainbow roll. The fish we did get was fresh, but again, not the best selection or pricing especially for maki.  I would recommend them for people looking for sushi/nigiri only, or perhaps ramen- their noodle dishes looked interesting!   The service and BYOB policy was great though."}
{"text":"If you want Japanese cuisine then Chaya has some really good dishes. However the sushi is not very good. The rolls are small and the sashimi is sloppy. I got a bone in a piece of salmon and they could care less. The waitress didn't seem surprised nor was anything done about it. Stick to the Japanese entrees and it will be expensive but good. Sushi isn't worth it."}
{"text":"It took me a really long time to try out Chaya again after the first time I went there there, but I'm so glad I did. Three years ago I had a date there that was okay and I didn't pay too much attention to the food, so I didn't go back.   Fast forward three years and I go to Chaya at least once per month. I've been happy with all of the sushi rolls I've had, and have been told that the sashimi is also very good. The service in the restaurant is pleasant and the food is packaged well for takeout. Each roll I've had has been eight pieces and are reasonably sized and filling.   I would keep in mind that Chaya has weird hours and their regular entrees are pretty expensive. The appetizers and all of the sides are average price for things like a side of soup, or vegetable tempura."}
{"text":"Best Japanese in Pittsburgh IMHO, and I've done my fair share of exploring the city's sushi options.   Chaya also has a high quality non-sushi menu, and for example I would highly recommend the blackened Cod. It's a small dish (you'll probably need more to eat than just this), but is incredible."}
{"text":"This is a really comfortable place to have a traditional Japanese meal. The servers were dressed in full authentic kimono (most places don't take the time nor expense to also wear the obis), the bamboo and other decorations created a nice Asian environment.   There were so many polar reviews...seemed folks were either really happy or not. So I didn't really know what to expect. The sushi rolls were priced modestly, but they are for the smaller rolls versus the \"regular\" sized roll. The flavor was good and it hit the spot.  I am so glad we went and I will be going back when I return to Pittsburgh! It is so nice to have a decent Japanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh (and even now that I don't live there), I consistently heard that Chaya was hands down the best sushi you could get in Pittsburgh.  It was certainly a solid experience. The fish quality isn't the greatest but is far from the worst. There's nothing technically wrong with Chaya, but I guess I don't feel the awesomeness that everyone else has noticed. So... 3 stars."}
{"text":"The extra star is for the fried chicken.  The lack of stars is for the expensive, boring, slightly stale, and tasteless sushi.  I mean, come on!  I have heard that it's really delicious and fresh and stuff on Friday nights, but that just makes me hate the place more.  Who the eff has their quality dictated by what day of the week it is?  Was I just eating bargain bin sushi at designer prices?  That pisses me off.  I have had some soups there, which are decent, and the sushi, which is horrible, (never been there on a Friday).  Probably never will.  Especially since I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore.  If this place were a fried chicken restaurant, I'd give it four stars.  Maybe five."}
{"text":"Regardless of the food quality, it is the service that really upsets me. We sat at the table for a long time and the waitress only came by to serve us some water and quickly went away. She never came back to take our orders until I went to the front desk and asked her PLEASE SEND A WAITRESS TO TAKE OUR ORDERS. The food came out really slow, too. This place definitely need to improve their service. I know it's packed on a Saturday night but there is no excuse for such terrible service and an upsetting experience."}
{"text":"So we went to Chaya for the first time this evening around 7:30...and by the time we left, there was a line out the door (literally)!  The atmosphere is very authentic, although I'm wondering how many people run into each other with the door AND the curtain for the entrance (really, do ya need both?).  The food tasted alright....and was presented on very pretty authentic looking plactes.  I wouldn't say this was the best food that I've ever had, but I also wouldn't say that it was terrible.  A lot of their dishes came with a side of fried chicken...is that really Japanese?  I honestly don't know, but it wasn't bad.  By the end of the night, the staff, consisting of four women, were literally running around...my guess is that they're not used to a crowd?  The service wasn't great or personable, but just like the food, it was just okay.  All in all, it was decent enough, but it's not a very convenient location, parking is a hassle, and there was nothing that'll cause me to really want to go there again (although if I ended up there, I'd be okay with that too)."}
{"text":"Worst japanese food we have ever eaten in our life. We are visiting Pittsburgh from asia. We looked into yelp recs and went to this restaurant. We ordered chicken, beef and salmon teriyaki. All were so bad, it feels like the chicken and beef have been soaked in the water, it has no taste. My son also had pork katsu, he hardly finished his food but he just ate a quarter of it. Sashimi just so so, we had salmon and uni sashimi."}
{"text":"Homey but very traditional sushi place that makes me feel I walked into a family restaurant in Japan.  BYOB. The best sushi in Pittsburgh but take that with a grain of salt :). Polite and lovely waitstaff usually dressed in traditional Japanese robes.  I enjoyed their vegetarian sushi rolls as well as the fried tofu dinner. I enjoy the edamame that comes with the dinner as a side dish. My husband always gets the sushi sampler dinner and says it tastes very fresh and is very filling.  Service is efficient and wait is rarely very long. We have been back here once since going 3 months ago. Look forward to coming again for my sushi fix. Good overall just not wow-worthy."}
{"text":"Used to go to this restaurant almost every week before but last time We were very disappointed with their customer service. We're gonna have to stop for while since they made us to lose our time and food. Why don't serve properly good customers?? Better find another place to dine out..."}
{"text":"maybe it's the best and most authentic Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh, but honestly not that great. Went there twice. Tried the delux sushi and katsudon. The nigiri was ordinary and didn't stand out, but the wasabi was good. Katsudon was huge which was cool, but it was too salty.   Just to be fair, I'm a huge fan of japanese food, and it's become a religion for me to find good places. So I'm pretty picky about my japanese food.   I will be going there again, for sure, just because it's the best(?) place to go in Pittsburgh? Maybe if I get something good next time, I'll change my review."}
{"text":"Food here are awesome! This's a wonderful place for Japanese food. Waitresses are very friendly. The restaurant run completely by Japanese. Definite recommended."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat in a Japanese owned sushi restaurant.  Ambience is bucolic (weird description, I know, but the atmosphere was very calming).  Lots of thought goes into the presentation.  My friend ordered the blackened cod which was served on an expertly fashioned banana leaf."}
{"text":"I've only been to this restaurant once. Based on the workers I saw, i got the impression that this restaurant is particularly authentic. At least they do a good job of trying to be? Anyway, I got a tofu appetizer, 4 rolls and several pieces to share with another person and I don't remember our check being too bad! For how much we ordered, we got pretty full and satisfied. However, I remember feeling underwhelmed by the size and quality if fish. Also, the rolls didn't arrive at our table in the best form; the presentation was okay. They gave very little ginger, and they only had regular soy sauce vs. less sodium sauce. But I think I was craving sushi so bad I didn't really care.  I will most likely go again because it's really close to where I live and it satisfies the craving so..."}
{"text":"The restaurant is much bigger since they moved 2 years ago.  If you want fresh sashimi this is the place to be. It doesn't have fancy rolls like you expect from other places so I could understand why some reviewers have been unhappy with the rolls. in fact, when we first moved to pittsburgh, my friends told me about it.  my gf hated it because she's more into the decadent rolls with all the toppings and sauces (like nakama)   However like places in japan, the quality of fish is the most important attribute of this restaurant.  I've tried every sushi place in town and it has the best freshest fish in town , hands down!  now i cant keep my gf from going back to this place every other weekend when she's in town. we're going to be very sad we cant eat at this place anymore."}
{"text":"I'm becoming one of those asians that only eat asian food when I travel. :X   Asian options are definitely limited in Pittsburgh, and the the few they have are generally pretty not-authentic. Luckily, there was Chaya! Chaya is a very authentic Japanese restaurant that serves a combination of traditional japanese dishes, interesting experimental things that you may not find at an average japanese joint, and americanized japanese food like a philadelphia roll (I mean c'mon, who puts cream cheese in sushi? D:) They're pretty pricey for pittsburgh standards I hear, but still much cheaper than SF.   I really enjoyed my dinner here. It's definitely my favorite restaurant meal here. We ordered the  - amaebi $4.50/each (sweet shrimp) - this is amazing :) they serve the shrimp body in nigiri form & the head fried with lime  - toro $5/each - really well priced toro. Not as fatty as you'd assume, but still delicious and a huge piece!  - raw squid in a sauce - this one's super unique, i've never had anything like it in the US, but I have had similar things in Asia.  - Kanpachi Kama - This is my least favorite item. I wanted the hamachi kama, but they didn't have in stock =( I would not recommend kanpachi over hamachi.  - chirashi - for sushi in a city with no near-by oceans. I was surprised by the quality of the sashimi. It's not as fresh as something expensive you'd get in Sf or nyc, but it's very very good for the price and considering the location."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chaya since before it moved to its current location.  I used to eat here at least once every week (before I had to move).  The sushi is great.  I love the quality and freshness of the fish.  I've been to a lot of sushi places and I don't appreciate the \"fancy\" sushi with lots of sauces and color.  Sushi should be very simple.  You should be able to taste the quality of the rice and fish without all of the added stuff.  Other non-sushi dishes are great too.  The dining experience if colorful especially when the owner's wife is there.  She's super friendly and a bit eccentric but I love her.  One thing about Chaya, though, is that the wait staff is super disorganized.  They are always running around (often confused), but this is nothing that I mind too much.  The food is great and the people are great too."}
{"text":"Acceptable Japanese food in Pittsburgh. Foods are good but very costly. (too?) friendly waitress. Love their dessert (ice-cream mochi)"}
{"text":"Beat Japanese ever!  It not only the freshest fish (which I was told by my sister that fish are flown over by a jet from a coast everyday) rice is prepared with a care and personal touch - the chef told me that the seasoned water for the rice are prepared the night before (which I can't give away the secret seasoning :p ) Not only will you find every thing you are familiar with sushi, sashimi, and nigiri, but you will also fine chef's special and unique dishes that you must try to experience the skill and excellence of the restaurant and chef's passion.  Excellent catering for party order take outs. When we go visit my sister in Pitt for a weekend, we always have a sushi night at Chaya or order a take out for a boat of sushi and sashimi or two -for a big event with family and friends."}
{"text":"Y'know, in all the years I've lived in the neighborhood, I'd never been to this place.  Indeed I think the only Japanese restaurant I'd been to in Pittsburgh has been Kiku.  I finally tried this place the other night when my friend Karen and I decided it was just too hot to go to the Three Rivers Arts Festival.  So I'm not big on sushi 'cos there's just something about raw, uncooked animal flesh that doesn't set well with me.  For those of us who aren't sushi fans, they have a lot of other things on their menu and --yikes-- it can be a little pricey!  Oh but it looks all so good.  Well I kicked off my meal with some miso soup and believe me, I enjoy a good miso soup!  Whereas Karen did go for the sushi, I went for the Unagi Kabayaki or broiled eel which was really good.  I also opted for the complete dinner which inlcuded salad, a fried chicken appetizer, and the miso soup.  As I said, some of the items on the menu are a little expensive but the complete dinner I had was only about $19.00.  I topped my dinner off with some Mochi, which is green tea & red bean ice cream.  Just so you know, Chaya doesn't serve alcohol but they do have BYOB.  But I suggest you try the oolong ice tea like I did, which was very refreshing.  They also have a whole bunch of Japanese soft drinks too."}
{"text":"Being a sushi snob, I had always considered Umi to be the city's gold standard.  While it still is, Chaya is very solid as well.  My sashimi was as fresh as possible, which is the most critical requirement (in the East End, one must carefully avoid some other sushi stops).  My son ordered the basic sushi platter, so we didn't give Chaya the chance to show off it's creativity, but his sushi was fresh and well prepared. The dining area is very comfortable as well.  PS - it is BYOB.  We stopped at East End Brewing first for a growler of beer, and the crisp waitstaff at Chaya had beer glasses on our table within seconds after we were seated!"}
{"text":"Came here last night. The place is pretty well lit, so if you're looking for a low-light romantic atmosphere, then not so much. But it's still a very nice casual space. The staff are friendly and courteous.  I had the rainbow roll and an eel roll, both very good, as well as the ika nigiri (squid). She had the dragon roll and a salmon roll as well as the salmon nigiri, which were quite good as well.  Overall, I would say this is one of the better places to get sushi in Pittsburgh. The items were fresh and delicious. Pretty fast service even on a relatively busy night. Atmosphere, casual."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous BYOB and sushi spot. Incredible food with fairly good prices. The service is also very good and the staff is very helpful. It can be very busy on weekends so be sure to make a reservation for large parties. Also keep in mind that they are closed for lunch!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Years ago i lived a 10 minute walk from here, which was very very dangerous. I ended up going here once a week at one point! So for my last meal on my Pittsburgh visit, I figured this spot would be perfect. It was just as good as I remember. Simply delicious. I had the Chirashi (this dish is always the true test of good Japanese food) meal with the salad and soup. The salad dressing was absolutely amazing. I drank the watery leftovers at the bottom of the bowl! The Chirashi was fresh and light, per the usual. I had a couple Toro Nigiris, as well. Actually, I had one, which was orgasmic, so I ordered a few more.   The food here is well prepared and presented. The fish is fresh - I saw the sushi chef cutting a fresh fish during my meal. The service is very polite and sweet. No complaints whatsoever. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Such great food. I'll certainly be back. They are one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants in town to be sure. If this is important to you in a restaurant, then I strongly recommend getting over here. We started with their green tea, which I was happy to discover, is a \"bottomless\" green tea (i.e. you can get your cup refilled). Perfect on the chilly night we went.   The server was helpful in guiding us towards and away from items that are authentic but perhaps not to Western palates. However, my dinner partner and I were up for a challenge, so we tried the natto (fermented soybeans, a specialty in Japan that is not typically beloved by westerners). It was certainly an experience! My dinner buddy LOVED it, and I found it very interesting and pretty good.  Next, we had some salmon sushi, which was buttery, fresh and perfect. We tried the shrimp and egg pudding for two, which was a favorite of mine. The warm pudding mixed with the perfectly-tender shrimp was great.  We had a yellowtail cheek, roasted, which is a favorite of my dinner partner's. Even I was impressed by the melt-in-your-mouth roasted fish. For those who are not used to this particular dish, there is not a huge quantity of meat, but the meat you do get is known to be the best morsel of fish you will ever have! It was very good!  Prices were a little higher than some other places, but the quality and service were relatively commensurate with the higher price. I'll be back - and I certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love Chaya. Went back for the first time in almost 5 years after leaving PGH. Still the the same basic rolls but SO good and affordable ( we got 2 apps and 8 rolls for roughly$50). No booze but it's BYOB. Wish they were open for lunch but oh well. There was no wait last night which made me so happy since they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Japanese food in Pittsburgh, then Chaya is your place.  I visited Chaya a whole lot in college, and when I was back in town for a few days it was at the top of my places to visit.  Something I should note here is that Chaya is not good for large groups.  They only have a few tables/booths that can fit more than 4 people and those can fill up, so either take a small group, go early, or be prepared for a potential wait.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, and you can't get seated until your entire party is there.  I haven't had anything from Chaya that I haven't enjoyed.  When I started going here I actually didn't eat raw fish, and I really liked the tempura and the katsu dons (rice bowls).  Now that I have added sushi to my diet, I can also recommend Chaya's - the fish is fresh, the sushi is well-constructed, and this is one of the rare places that uses fresh wasabi.  If you're visiting with a friend or can convince one of the people in your party to split something, the sushi boat or the combination dinners with sushi and a soup are fine choices.  If you order the dinner set (which I recommend), entrees come with miso soup, salad and fried chicken.  Chaya was just as good as I remembered - outstanding food and friendly service.  I'll definitely try to eat here again the next time I'm back!"}
{"text":"Finally, a legitimate AND affordable Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. (Please realize I crave sushi on a tri-weekly basis, at least.) While I'm still making my way down their sushi roll list, the Hobart St. roll is a favorite along with anything yellowtail.  And oh god, sashimi. THE FISH HERE IS FRESH.  Street parking can be tough in Squirrel Hill but I recommend eating in; the place is complete with home-style Japanese ambiance--the waitresses all wear yukata and geta (wooden clogs) and shuffle around in a quite demure fashion."}
{"text":"The most authentic Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh area. I am Japanese and every time I go there I feel I am home."}
{"text":"I gotta say - I just don't get it.  This place has a lot of good reviews, many of which claim that the food is the highlight of the place.  Maybe they were having an off day, but I just don't see it.     We ordered a roll combo and a deluxe sushi combo with the dinner set-ups.  The total was $49 before tip with just water to drink.  We started with the ginger salad - a small handful of spring mix with a glop of ginger dressing.  The dressing was bland and I really sort of missed the crunch of the traditional iceberg.  The soup had a weird aftertaste that I just couldn't place.  The fried chicken bites with lime were pretty good, though I didn't really understand that whole course as part of a sushi dinner.     The roll combo was pretty basic - a California roll, tuna roll, and salmon roll plus a eel hand roll.  Nothing fancy and nothing special.  They were actually a little skimpy on the fish if you ask me - it might have been high quality, but I couldn't taste it because it was overwhelmed by the rice, etc.  The eel roll was the best of the bunch, but again, not a lot of fish in it.  The deluxe sushi platter came with two roe offerings, a tuna roll, and some basic nigiri.  Again, nothing really to rave about.  My roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue.  It almost seemed like they rolled it up and then placed it under a heat lamp for a few minutes.    The décor and service were also nothing special, so again, I just don't get all the four and five star reviews.   I didn't hate it, but I have definitely had better sushi around town."}
{"text":"From my point of view, the food is not authentic Japanese. Japanese restaurant is famous for polite and good customer service and great well-made food. In Chaya, the price does not match the food quality, nor the customer service. Comparing to other non-fast food sushi restaurants, Chaya has no advantage but higher price.  About their customer service, my friends told me one time when they just finished eating, and just chatted a little while, the staff came to ask them to leave in order to save seats for other guests. I thought perhaps this was tolerable. When I was waiting with my friend during busy hours, I saw at least 3 tables were empty in about 25 minutes, but the waitress completely ignored us. After waiting for a while more, I had to ask the staff if we could seat  and they told us they need to clean the table, but I saw the tables had all been cleaned up already."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I did.  After reading Yelp reviews, I was excited at the prospect of good sushi within walking distance from my new apartment, so I went for a sushi dinner with a friend.  I will grant the enthusiastic reviewers that the sushi at Chaya is better and more Japanese than the Chinese-run sushi restaurant around the corner.  It is, however, still mediocre sushi: no flavor, a bit dry, completely unmemorable.  I even disliked their unagi rolls, and if you've read any of my other sushi restaurant reviews, you'll understand what a blow that was.    On the upside, the restaurant is pleasantly decorated and the service is fast and friendly.  Their miso soup was also quite good.  Perhaps their non-sushi entreés are better?"}
{"text":"Very expensive!  Delicious food and plenty of it.  The waitress was a bit odd, she trying to be funny and not really knowing English."}
{"text":"Took a chance and returned to Chaya for take out. This time I ordered the delux sushi combination a la carte.  At $32 dollars this really is a steal. One could expect to pay 3x as much for similar quality in more of a \"foodie\" city.  Mine included 14 pieces of nigiri, cali roll, and shrimp head.  The nigiri pieces were all quality. Perfect portion/temperature of rice, and I enjoyed the consistency. All the pieces tasted fresh tonight, (including the uni which I believe had gone bad on my first visit)  Glad I went back, and I'll be back again.   I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but to get 5 stars it would have to surpass umi which was probably the best meal I've had. Not to mention, I'm still a bit bitter from my first visit."}
{"text":"This place is so expensive but it has consistently been work every cent.  I go coo coo (sp?) for their egg custard, known as chawanmushi.  SO GOOD.  Everything there is so great!  I highly recommend.  It's authentic.  Their wasabi is also fresh.  If you want good Japanese, this is the place to go.   Go big or go home!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid Japanese food, I must say. I'm originally from California and I go to school in New York so I've tasted some pretty good Japanese food before and I would definitely say that Chaya is among the top contenders. Is it the best Japanese food I've ever had? No, I wouldn't say that at all. But is it Japanese food that is enjoyable? Yes, I would definitely vouch for that.  I think my slight issue is that I feel like the prices are a bit more on the expensive side. I don't think some of the items on the menu are reasonable at all, but I mean, I suppose they can charge whatever they want since they're one of the better places I've had in Pittsburgh. Service is very nice and always coming by to ask how the food is and if you want any water refills so at least that is good.  If you want traditional Japanese cuisine in Pittsburgh and you have some money to spare, I would definitely say this is a place to go."}
{"text":"The best sushi bar in The Burgh. I lived in Southern California for ten years, and this place is better than some sushi restaurants out there. The sushi is always super fresh, and the few cooked dished I've had are wonderful as well.  Try the broiled toro, yellow tail belly, and always amazing uni.  And the absolute best and coolest thing about this place, besides the hilarious sushi chef, is the fresh grated wasabi. That is a treat you do not see everywhere, even in CA or NY!  Go to this place, if you are a sushi lover you will fall in love!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese place in Pittsburgh. Very authentic, very fresh, and very tasty food. Only thing I don't like was the small place -- they need more space! So sometimes it can be a wait, but it's certainly worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent. This sounds crazy, but this is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in the country. Nyc, LA, SF, Hawaii, Chicago. Sashimi here is fresh and delicious. Quality is outstanding. And, the dinner option with salad, soup, and fried chicken make it an excellent value. The black cod is also very good."}
{"text":"There is no way that you can beat buying your own six pack and posting up with it in a restaurant with great sushi.  Chaya's sushi selection is amazing and diverse.  My favorite was a spicy sunrise tempura roll, but everything I tried was great.    So we had some edamame, just to have something to snack on with our beers.  Now my friends brought some Hoegaarden, but I wanted to try to mix it up a little so, Dos Equis accompanied me through the night and boy was it a great night and surprisingly went very well with the sushi.  Started off with spicy tuna and avocado roll and spicy tempura roll. It did take a little bit of time to get the order, but it was great once it arrived.  Normally I would/should just end with that, but I thought I might as well try something else of the menu.  Well the sunrise tempura roll was awesome, thoroughly enjoyed it.    Overall the service was very friendly and food was excellent.  This is the perfect spot for good sushi without all the overdone theatrics and spoofs of some other sushi joints."}
{"text":"We have done dine in and takeout from Chaya over the past several years, and it has always been a delightful meal. This is our go-to for sushi; someday I hope to convince myself to expand to the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Chaya is simply amazing.  It's a little hole in the wall place in Squirrel Hill that doesn't immediately grab your attention.  It's extremely small inside so make sure you go in small groups.  They are also very picky about your entire group being there before you are seated.  The service is quick and friendly and the waitresses will make suggestions for you if for some reason you can't decide between two rolls that look equally amazing :)  The rolls are all very consistently good and the fish is always extremely fresh.  The menu is very traditional - there are a few rolls that have a bunch of different ingredients but it's not a \"fusion-sushi\" type of place that seems to be getting popular.  The sushi is very affordable, especially for the quality.  Now if only I still lived right around the corner..."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in Pittsburgh, PERIOD. Nothing else comes anywhere close to the authentic food one finds here. From the freshly grated wasabi to the natto to the fatty tuna, Chaya destroys its competition. Try to get there before 7 on the weekends to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Chaya is amazing. Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh, and very cheap if you only order rolls. The atmosphere is cozy, well-decorated, and quiet--overall, it's a very pleasant experience. However, service can be slow when they're busy, so I wouldn't recommend going during prime dinnertime on a weekend."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh. The fish was of higher quality than other restaurants I've been to, and is about the same price.  The sushi dinners are excellent as they come with a salad, miso soup and these lovely little fried chicken bites.   The wait staff was attentive and considerate. The restaurant is clearly well managed. The food was brought out in a timely manner - we had each piece of the meal separately and didn't wait more than a few minutes for the next one. The restaurant is beautifully decorated (we were surprised by how different it looks from the outside!) and clean. I'm impressed and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the pricier Japanese places around, but you pay for the experience (and the food). From the more traditional and intimate space to the nostalgic dress of the waitstaff, you almost forget you're still in Pittsburgh. Their menu is large, and depending on what you order it can easily come out to $30 or $70 per person. I personally found the fish to be tasty and fresh, and I did end up feeling pretty full from the Salmon Lovers combo. I do wonder if the Regular sushi or sashimi combos would have been enough, which are also not cheap but still a bit more affordable.   They have a ton of other things besides sushi, although most are still probably 50% more than I would like to pay for them. The hot pot, tempura, some of the noodles, and traditional combination dinners are probably good to get and better than your typical hibachi place. The salmon teriyaki was done nicely and was very flavorful. Finally, most entrees come with a small but very tasty and tender chicken karaage that's totally worth getting on its own."}
{"text":"Read many good things and was excited to try some seriously good sushi in Pittsburgh -- this was not the place to come to though. For the superior cuts of fish they claim to give, I found the sushi mostly flavorless. And at the price I was paying, it was like a double slap in the face. There is better and cheaper in Pittsburgh than here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area! We came here on a Saturday night, and we had a good 30 minute wait before we were seated. Apparently they take reservations only for special course meals. Anyways, once we were seated the service was a bit slow owing to the fact that it was a weekend, but that was understandable.   We ordered the fried chicken to start with, and it had a nice taste to it, and seemed to be freshly made. Adding a few drops of lemon juice on it made it seem more flavorful. Then the sushi came out and it was delicious! We tried the Avocado roll, Salmon roll and the tempura roll. It seemed to be very freshly made, and even the rice had a nice texture to it. The wasabi was just right, strong and fresh. The place is also BYOB so it works out cheaper and the fact that there are many liquor stores nearby, helps! We enjoyed the meal and we would be back again soon."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chaya pretty frequently, but after a series of so-so to below-average experiences around 2006, I got out of the habit of going. On occasion, though, when I read another review extolling its virtues, I'd contemplate going back. It'd be awfully convenient to have a neighborhood sushi place.    Tonight I returned to the familiar cozy little dining room once more. Almost everything is as I remembered (the price went up, but I shouldn't begrudge them for keeping up with inflation). The best thing about the meal is still the fried chicken that comes with the dinner set.   Unfortunately, the negative aspects also are as I remembered.  The salad dressing is overly watery, and the sushi combo is still a let-down. The selection is pretty run-of-the-mill sushi fare: tuna, salmon, shrimp, some roes, and eel. The cut ought to be fresh, as it is purportedly flown in, but the taste was just not there. The fatty tuna pieces did not have that melt in your mouth feel nor did they have that suculant sweet taste. Instead, they looked a bit dried out and tasted bland.   Overall, I was disappointed. I would have liked to return to the days when I had a reliable neighborhood sushi joint. Well, perhaps in another three years, I'll give Chaya another shot."}
{"text":"Weird, weird place.  I've never been somewhere that made you feel so uncomfortable as a patron.  This was on a Friday night from 8:30-~9:30.  They close at 9:45.  The sushi was good - not spectacular.  The nice thing is that  the rolls were cheaper and smaller in portion size so you could sample a few.  I also liked the selection of nigiri.   The attitude there - from the menu warnings to the inclusion of a  tip calculator with your bill is really weird.  When you open the menu, you are confronted with a list of about 7 or 8 rules of engagement.  These range from a refusal to split a check to a line that says they occasionally at their discretion add in a 17% service charge (not table occupancy related).  There were quite a few of these and it seem like an awful lot for a place that only seats about 25.  It's BYOB, yet they charge $2 for every wine or beer glass and then an extra $3 for chilling or ice.  They didn't open our wine but just left a bottle opener at the table.  The restaurant was fairly empty, yet all the prime booths and the Sushi bar seats were demarcated as \"reserved\".  We were the last people there and nobody ever came to claim the special seating.  They remained set and reserved until about 30 minutes before closing when they cleaned them off while we were eating.  The restaurant is almost eerily quiet except for the occasional whispering among the wait staff. It seems like you aren't assigned any particular server as they all hover around your table waiting for you to want something.  When they aren't  doing this, they huddle in the corners and whisper to each other.  It's distracting with the lack of music.  Really weird place.  The final strangeness was that the bill is proffered in your typical black check book that contains a list of tip calculations in fluorescent green.  For a place that seems to average about $70 for two people with tip, I don't think the weirdness is worth it."}
{"text":"FOOD - I had their sushi/sashimi boat, uni appetizer, desserts, and few other food. Everything was very fresh. I've heard that they get their fish fresh from market everyday. They are also usually referred to as one of the freshest sushi from Pittsburgh. However, their sushi/sashimi boat lack of variety, their rolls are neither flavorful nor creative. Their udon/soba noodles have plain average taste. Overall their food is pretty boring.  SERVICE - Their service is okay. Not good but not bad.  ENVIRONMENT - It is conveniently located in squirrel hills and is pretty busy most of the time. There are often some people waiting for a table. The place is not loud and pretty quiet and clean.  Overall, It is the go to place for sushi/sashimi(salmon/tuna mainly), but maybe not for rolls or any other Japanese food."}
{"text":"Chaya is good. The fish is fresh, the prices are reasonable (I definitely wouldn't call it pricey), and the service is very nice. All around a pleasant dining experience. Five stars... not quite, but a decent four. I think my expectations were set too high after reading all these reviews, because I just wasn't as wowed as I thought I'd be. The entire time I was eating I wanted the sushi to have just a little bit more flavor, but it  didn't quite get there. Kind of like when you think you're about to sneeze but then you don't. Anyway, I recommend Chaya for good sushi, but not for great sushi. Great sushi will have to wait for a trip to the east or west coast."}
{"text":"While the sushi selection at Chaya looked great, we decided to try a few other items instead.  We sampled a handful of apps, including their egg custard, various pickles, and soft shell crab.  The custard was solid, the soft shell crab was accompanied by an awesome dipping sauce, and the pickled vegetables were great!  We also went with the beef udon dinner entree.  Yes, it seemed a bit odd that it comes with pieces of fried chicken, but wow that's some unique fried chicken.  By the time we got to the udon, we were both approaching full, yet the first taste ensured we both made room to enjoy."}
{"text":"First taste of sushi in Pittsburgh!!! And it was pretty good. This is a tiny restaurant with about 10 tables (but they are moving, so probably getting a bigger space?) The menu is huge and the sushi menu was hard to find at first because it's in a plaque on top of the table. The restaurant is BYOB and doesn't serve any alcohol. The service was fine, had to ask for a tea refill myself but definitely not anywhere near rude."}
{"text":"2 years later, I have still only ordered Super Deluxe Sushi Dinner set.  I agree with others, this place is expensive.  and therefore, only Super Deluxe Sushi Dinner set pays for itself with uni, scallop and raw shrimp.  You can get decent udon and tempura from other places with cheaper price.   No Sundays, no lunch and weekends are too crowded. I normally go on weekdays.    It is a Japanese-owned restaurant, the language gave it away.  I think the owner is here often too, 3/4 of the waitresses are wearing robes, and the one bossing around wears a T-shirt. It's a reasonable guess.  The owner's English is so-so. She is a good person, but sometimes just hard to communicate with.  I only want to point this out, because i think this place's review is suffering from the awkwardness of the owner.  I honestly think that the other waitresses are more professional and the owner is often making things worse, though she does not mean it."}
{"text":"Great place to go to for Japanese food in Pittsburgh! It is more on the pricey end but it is worth it. The chef, waiters, and owner are actually Japanese instead of Chinese so this isn't your typical Chinese-Japanese fusion restaurant. Some of their daily special fishes are flown in from Japan so of course very expensive.  Their sushi is very fresh but I always order their Tonkatsu Dinner. The Dinner comes with a cutlet, rice,  Kara-age Fried Chicken, soup and salad for $16-17. Perfect for sharing if you want to save some money.  One of my favorites is their Udon. The Nabeyaki Udon comes with two shrimp tempura that are nice and crispy. It's also full of vegetables (I think it might have been enoki mushrooms, Napa cabbage, shitake mushrooms, tong ho). The broth was wonderful and the noodles had a great texture.  I've also tried their Omakase Mini Kaiseki Dinner which was $47 a person. This is where I deduct a star. It was both expensive and not worth the price. The sushi and sashimi they give you for this are average whereas I know some places in Manhattan give you all different kinds in their Omakase for less. The broiled fish was also a little dry. I won't say the food wasn't good because it was, but the quality definitely doesn't match the price.  For dessert I recommend the green tea ice cream. They roll little rolls of green tea ice cream in matcha powder. The mochi ice cream is also delicious. Both are kind of overpriced but perfect to end the meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went her New Year's Eve night, 2010. We loved it! The atmosphere and service is fantastic. The staff is dressed very authentically Japanese and loves to interact with their clientele. The food was amazing. I had fried oysters, which are brought out in the shell. There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. Our bill was approx $60 for 2 entrees, two appetizers, twos soups and salads. It was a very nice experience and date!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and some of the best I've had anywhere. They also have yellowtail collar (one of my favorite Japanese dishes), complete with grated daikon, as well as authentic oshinko. No dyed yellow takuan here.  The sea urchin was amazing, especially, as well as the scallop. It at least used to be BYOB; I'm not sure if that's changed in the past three years.  I haven't been since they changed locations, and I need to get back again soon; I do have a birthday coming up. Sadly it's too expensive for me to go as often as I'd like, but it's certainly worth the price. One of my top five favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"The best basic rolls I've had in Pittsburgh!  The service was good and the rolls were fresh, simple, and delicious. I'd say the price point is very fair. This is going to be my go-to for sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"Chaya is an extremely impressive Japanese restaurant: the food is great, the sushi is leagues better than anything else in Pittsburgh that I've found, and because it's actually run by Japanese people who make pretty authentic stuff.  The menu is a little intimidating, especially if you're not tremendously versed in Japanese cuisine, because it's surprisingly long, and I just didn't know what the hell to order. In the end, I ordered a Deluxe Sushi & Sashimi Combination Dinner, and my girlfriend ordered two rolls and a tempura appetizer.   All the dinners come with a salad, miso soup, and some pieces of kaarage (fried boneless chicken). The salad is pretty average. The miso soup is quite good, but nothing to write home about. The kaarage, on the other hand, prompted me to write this review. These three pieces of juicy, tender, crispy chicken morsels were simply the best fried food of any sort I've had in the last year. I'd highly recommend that everyone opt for a 'dinner' rather than 'a la carte;' the $3 they charge on top is well worth it.  Moving on, the tempura was very well done, with everything evenly and lightly battered. Oftentimes Japanese places will be very heavy-handed with the batter, which makes for unenjoyable tempura, but Chaya's tempura was right on the mark.   As for sushi and sashimi, my combination came out with a very respectable amount of food. Then again, it was $32. In any case, the quality of the fish was very good, but not quite top-notch. It was easily the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh, but I have had better elsewhere. I really enjoyed their tuna, eel, and salmon. The quality of the sushi rice is simply superb. They either make their own ginger and wasabi, or they use a better quality, because both are far better than the norm, especially the ginger. My girlfriend's rolls, a Cali roll and a JJ Roll (tuna + cream cheese) were pretty mediocre, but the rice for that was amazing too.  Hands down best Japanese place in Pittsburgh, and I really wish I could give a 4.5, but I rounded down because it's a very solid restaurant, but it didn't astound me for the most part. Still, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here since they moved locations, but I am surprised at how many people rate this place as 5 stars. Sure, you can get a sushi roll for $4, but it has 15 micrograms of fish in it!! These were the smallest rolls I have ever seen anywhere. Come on people, I know Pittsburgh doesn't have much Asian cuisine, but when you've tasted the nectar of real sushi, you'll realize how much this place doesn't compare. Then update your review.  My friend and I were completely disappointed when we ate here. Plus the service was horrible that night."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite sushi place in Squirrel Hill.  If you go, ask for the chef's special.  It's expensive but man, it is so good."}
{"text":"Hey, you dont get this great japanese food anywhere else around pittsburgh. I guess they deserve the title of the best japanese food around them. But they need more servers and chefs. It take forever to prepare the food and even to get to seat during crazy hours"}
{"text":"Authentic like no other!! The appetizers are small plates of bliss! If my grandma was Japanese (which she  wasn't) I know it would taste similar to this!!!"}
{"text":"The rice tasted as though it was scrapped off the side of a pan that had been sitting over-night on the stove.  I suppose that because people are the 'last call' they do not get anything fresh?  Should I have cooked and brought my own rice?  This was unfortunate, and my date and I both looked at each other thinking the same thing as we took our first piece from the roll(s).  And I wouldn't of given a rating had she not asked me disappointed if my sushi tasted a 'little different'.     Also, not sure how I feel about sitting in the waiting area while there are fifteen (15) tables available at 8:00 at night.  The only reason this restaurant received one (1) star was because my date looked beautiful and was a pleasure to be with.  Otherwise it would have received a -0-.  Do not do me wrong, the restaurant was in fact clean, with polite servants and was well air-conditioned.  Looking at this fairly,... this might have been a one time occurrence, non-recurring obviously, but because I will not be giving it another chance I do not see the chance for an improvement.  I cannot stand giving these types of ratings.  I think it is well justified.  Especially because I love and know my sushi."}
{"text":"Chaya is a cozy Japanese place that despite having a very complete menu, falls short in executing a tasty meal.  I came in for a simple deluxe sashimi platter. The dinner set came with a salad and fried chicken appetizer.  The salad was a typical Japanese salad with sauce, and the chicken was alright. It was boneless, which was a treat, but had nothing special.   The main was the sashimi, which to my disappointment came in a pretty small portion. There were maybe 12 pieces total, which is quite expensive at 35$. However, the biggest disappointment was probably the sashimi itself. The fish did not taste very fresh, knife skills of the chef weren't great (I had some scrappy pieces), and I had quite a few bites of tendon. I also want quite sure how the fish was prepared, but their taste wasn't very clean...the fish tasted really old and dirty.  Also, having hot rice served with the sashimi was a real setback. The temperatures completely clashed, and the loose rice did not pair well with the more slimy texture of the fish. I think sushi rice needs to be considered here...  I had a dessert before I left, which I enjoyed. But it was basically an off the shelf ice cream mochi, which you can get basically anywhere.  Overall, the place is very complete and stands out as a higher end sushi place, but the fish quality, serving preparation and small choices in dishes really downgraded the otherwise impressive menu items."}
{"text":"Place was horrible.  Everything was overpriced.  This wouldn't be an issue but the food was bad. The main course, which was a black cod, was burnt.   I also had the sushi which was on par with a typical sushi buffet. Service was ok. The place even had a section on their menu that states what they charged for BYOB items and even ice, so tacky!  This place is BYOB hostile!   Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"1.  Authentic 2.  Byob ($2 per beer/wine glass + $2 per shot glass if you bring sake) 3.  Reasonably priced 4.  Good service 5.  Cant wait to go back  Be prepared for a wait, but its worth it.   One of the stand-outs on the, less than impressive, Murray Ave.    I don't understand the fried chicken thing.... but i will admit - its good!     The teriyaki steak was not what I was expecting but then again - how do I know if I have ever really had an authentic teriyaki.  The steak was broiled and came with a very thin steak-juice like sauce.  I'm more accustomed to a thicker sauce which is more prominent in the overall dish.  Not a deal breaker by any means.   Best no-frills sushi I have had here.  It should not disappoint."}
{"text":"As far as Pittsburgh goes, I think this is one of the best Sushi places around (Tamari is the other great find). I've been here quite a few times and I've never been disappointed. Usually, I go for the delicious rolls, but last night I opted for the Chirashi dinner (basically a bunch of sashimi on a bed of sticky rice). Yum!  The dinners come with soup, salad, and fried chicken! And all for around $20/person (that's without apps), so not too shabby as far as sushi goes. I plan on making many visits in the future.  Oh, they are apparently moving up the block (literally...just one block up the hill on Murray Ave), so if you don't see them at the original location, don't panic!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been to in Pittsburgh. It's pretty pricey for poor college students like me, but as a once in a while very special treat, I don't mind at all. I went here with a guy friend and we definitely came at the perfect time--around 6?--as we were leaving a huge rush of people came.  Chaya was so cute--everything in it is Japanese themed, from the origami on the wall, to the kimonos that the servers wore.  We ordered the dinner special for two which cost around $38 dollars and included salad, sushi, tempura, fried chicken, and udon.  I was so full by the time we finished the sushi, but I still made room for the udon and the tempura. The sushi was great. It was all the usual nigiri, but everything was very fresh, unlike a lot of sushi places in Pittsburgh. The friend chicken was definitely a treat. It was hot, tender, juicy and just plain delicious.  The tempura was crisp and delicate. I was a little surprised that no sweet soy sauce was given, but that wasn't a big deal at all. The udon was tasty as well. Not the best I've had, but still very good.  I really liked this place because unlike most of the sushi places in Pittsburgh, it wasn't a Japanese fusion place. It seemed very genuine and the food was great and fresh ^_____^   I will definitely be back for special occasions :)"}
{"text":"Since we live a few blocks away from what many are calling the best sushi in Pittsburgh, we felt it was our duty to try it ASAP!  We strolled in for a date night on a Thursday around 6pm, and were seated immediately.  The restaurant is pretty small, so I'd imagine there can be quite a wait on weekends.  All the seats are pretty close together, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!  But it's not a big deal if you have a good attitude.  The interior is bright, with lots of little Japanese accents in the decor.  The servers wear kimonos and sandals, and were very helpful to us.  Our server recommended an alternate appetizer, saying it was more popular (and, presumably better) then the one we had ordered - and she was right on the money!  Also, a woman who I believe was the owner came around to check on us a few times, and she actually moved my soy sauce dish closer to my right hand, saying it would be easier for me that way.  It wasn't an intrusive gesture - it felt sort of like a kindly mother giving you a little pointer.  Not being interested in paying $2 per person for BYOB, we just had water and I had an iced green tea, which came in a can but was still very tasty.  We began with miso soup and salad, which was the standard fare that you can expect at any sushi place.  Our appetizer was the \"giant clam cooked in its shell\" or something to that effect.  And indeed- out came a platter with a giant clam shell, with some sizzling bubbly goodness cooking inside it.  Why was it sizzling?  Oh, because it was on fire!  Well, the clam wasn't on fire, but there was some fuel source on the plate, and there were beautiful flames licking the clam shell and making our appetizer bubble in a most delicious looking way.  Not only delicious looking but delicious tasting, we loved the appetizer.  The clam is cooked in some sort of spicy mayo sauce, and it was pretty darn delectable.  I was licking my plate with my finger to get all of the sauce after we had eaten all the clam pieces.  Yummy!  I'd order that one again if I didn't want to try so many other things.  Most entrees looked expensive, so we decided to stick with sushi.  Their roll selection is simple, and I'd imagine it is also traditional - no crazy rolls here, just fresh fish and vegetables prepared simply.  We enjoyed the Sunrise ECA roll (eel, cucumber, avocado), the Mix Roll (tuna, salmon, whitefish), and the Tropical Island roll (shrimp, tuna, avocado, and radish sprouts).  The rolls are small, just six standard size pieces, but it was plenty of food for us along with the appetizer, soup, and salad.  The sushi was very good, clearly fresh, and pleasant to eat.  The rice seemed a bit dry to me, and the presentation wasn't flashy like you see at other sushi restaurants, but it was a satisfying and highly inexpensive dinner!  I think I would rather get sashimi and nigiri next time to really enjoy the quality of the fish, but the rolls were very good too.  Our bill was only $30, but I know next time we will try new things and it will cost a bit more.  Still, it was a lovely neighborhood restaurant with traditional, fresh food, and that's the kind of place where I'd like to return and give them more business."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because I'm comparing it to other Japanese/sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh. Having lived in Seattle last year if I were comparing to everywhere I've been I would probably rate it 3 stars but good sushi is hard to find here.  My friend and I shared a sushi/sashimi combo and ordered a couple of rolls.  Everything was very good and seemed fresh.  Portions and prices were decent.  Definitely a good value for the price.  Not the best quality sushi I've ever had, but for Pittsburgh it's the best I've seen so far, but I haven't tried Umi yet which seems to be a lot pricier.  Ambiance was nice and service was good.  Food came out quickly.  I appreciated the other reviews on here alerting me that the restaurant was BYOB and so I came prepared with my own beer.  I kind of like that aspect of this place since Japanese places that do serve beer usually have a pretty limited selection."}
{"text":"SETTING: Probably the most authentic Japanese as you can get in Pittsburgh. From the get-go, I noticed the flower arrangements, the wooden tables and furniture, and the Japanese music lightly playing in the background. Chaya was beautiful and the establishment made quite the impression. The traditional decor and warm atmosphere was exactly what I needed to help me relax and enjoy some Japanese comfort food.   FOOD: We shared the Regular Sushi & Sashimi Combination. The course starts with a miso soup and small salad, then a small karaage (japanese fried chicken). Finally the platter comes out, an assortment of sashimi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, etc) and california rolls.   Miso soup and salad were pretty standard, as they should be. I love chicken karaage, so I was a bit disappointed that it was a bit small (four bite-sized pieces). That being said, they do a great job with creating a tender and juicy appetizer. The Sushi and Sashimi combo definitely featured fresh and good quality sashimi and sushi. Overall, it's not exactly filling if you're sharing between two hungry people, but is is a perfectly light dinner.   SERVICE: Kind and professional staff. They are very attentive and come by when every dish is served to ask how we like it and if we need more water. I believe all the waitresses and the sushi chef are Japanese as well, and they were very gentle and created a wonderful dining experience for us.  IMPRESSIONS: As much as my hungry stomach may disagree, particularly when it hijacks my mind's sound decision-making, I'm always about quality over quantity. Chaya is quality. Not just the food, but from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the staff, and of course, their dishes all create a remarkable casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype, this is not good sushi. The decor is nice and the staff pleasant, but their sushi sucks. We went on a Friday night so the place should have been on their A-game.  Gyoza: these were the highlight of the meal. Fried on one side steamed on the other, and the dumpling sauce was great.  Tuna Poke: where's the sesame oil? And the pieces were mush, like they were left over cuts. I dipped it in the leftover dumpling sauce for flavor.   Sushi & Rolls: tuna belly is normally the highlight of a sushi dinner out and we got excited when the waitress came with the plate and a blow torch in hand. Unfortunately she proceeded to over cook the belly. Further, it did not have the melty quality that it should, and the rice below fell apart in our fingers. That was actually a theme of the dishes we had: crap sushi rice. I mean, seriously, Whole Foods makes better sushi rice than this place. Tastier rolls too. We got a double salmon roll that actually had a fishy taste. And the yellowtail was chewy and stringy. Tuna avocado was surrounded by an overly thick layer of flavorless and crumbly rice. Ick.   We left extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 on service and value--  Service was quite pleasant: our server magically appeared when we needed water but was completely unobtrusive otherwise. She was also volunteered that we could split our checks without us asking.   The homemade wasabi was really tasty although less spicy than one would typically expect.  As for the maki, the fish seemed quite fresh and the menu has a nice variety of cooked, vegetarian, and raw rolls.  However, the inside-out rolls had a rather thick layer of rice relative to filling and the rice did not completely cover the nori, which detracted from the aesthetic.  That might sound overly picky but part of the appeal of sushi is in its presentation. The vegetable tempura and the Murray Avenue rolls were especially good, but the Squirrel Hill roll was unremarkable.    I'd definitely come here again given the price--$17 after tax and tip for 3 good-sized rolls is a great deal, but if you're looking for perfectly executed sushi, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I love sushi and Japanese food in general, and Chaya is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to.  I came here a while ago on my first trip to Pittsburgh and on my recent trip, I knew I had to stop by again.   The food is amazing, we ordered a bunch of items, but I am just going to highlight my favorites.  The sashimi is fresh and the portion was great.  Make sure to try their fatty tuna and salmon.  Additionally, their fried chicken is fantastic, crispy, fragrant, and moist.  The waitress was very nice and the owner was running around helping out as well.  It's always great to see, a business owner dedicated and truly care about their customers.  It is more on the pricey side of Pittsburgh but well worth it.  I will definitely be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Agreed.  Good sushi at a fair price in cute, cozy, convenient and unpretentious digs."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant in Squirrel Hill with EXCELLENT japanese food and sushi. Our family is good friends with the owners of the place so they're alway super friendly to us when we come to eat. Even when they're not there, the wait staff is real friendly to us.  Before your meal, the appetizer they give you is three pieces of fried chicken. IT IS SO GOOD. Cool appetizer (:  I definitely recommend anything from their sushi / sashimi menu. It's always real fresh and well made. Get the sushi and sashimi combination. 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 california rolls, 7 pieces of sushi, 2 pieces of crab meat equals one satisfied and full customer!  Their donkatsu is also so good! Get it when you're super hungry because they give you so much!   Seriously, everything about this place is so good. The tempura, the udon soup, even their salad! Their ginger dressing is so good.  Everyone go. Worth the money."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this, but in order to really be true to the spirit of Yelp! I have to.  We had a really large group tonight, so that may have also played a part, but this review is basically for the past 3-4 times we've been.  Traditionally, what has set this place apart is the quality of their ingredients and the overwhelmingly incredible flavors that they have been able to achieve with simplicity and traditional Japanese techniques. Tonight, well, it was pretty mediocre.  We arrived as a group of 9 - 6 adults and 3 fairly young kids, and the hostess sort of rolled her eyes at that. Until today, we were always greeted with a smile and a genuine sense that they were happy to see us. We were seated fairly quickly, though, so we just let that go.  Ordering wasn't too bad - we all wrote out what we wanted and didn't make it hard on our server by going round and round. We had one list, and everything came as ordered.  Here's where it gets a little sad for me - I've written several reviews of this place before and it's sad for me to say that I think that the quality of the ingredients has dipped a bit. The fish was a bit \"mealy\" these past few times, and the availability of unique off-menu specials like fresh uni is pretty much a rare thing. It wasn't bad, but it was just average. That's a big letdown for me. This area is a bit of a haul for us, it's BYOB, and parking stinks - we have always overlooked these inconveniences because of the amazing quality and service the extra effort (and price) provided. It just wasn't there these past few times.  Oh yes, the gyozas and chicken kara-age were pretty good; as was the beef negimaki. It's just that the rest seemed so diminished from what we've had before.  As we left, we heard the staff apologize to some folks waiting for a table, saying that \"unfortunately the big party that just left took much longer than normal.\" I guess our almost $300 check wasn't worth it to them. Oh well - it will definitely be a while before we go back to see if things have changed. Maybe other folks can take advantage of us not taking up space."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh every week for work from NYC, and have put Chaya into my regular weekly rotation (along with Cure, Dish and Morcilla) because it is a great old-school Japanese restaurant. I am an extremely jaded eater, and this place is good by New York standards, and at an extremely reasonably price point. Don't expect anything trendy or showy - expect excellent Nigiri. They serve fresh wasabi - for those of you that don't know the difference between fresh wasabi and dried, or between Nigiri and spicy crunchy tuna rolls, this probably isn't the place for you. For those of you who appreciate good traditional Japanese food, ask the chef to make you 10 or 12 pieces of Nigiri - his choice. You will certainly have a delicious night."}
{"text":"THE best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Their sushi is fresh and delicious.  I absolutely love their salads and their amazing ginger salad dressing.  Friendly service, traditional decor and an extensive menu.  Everything on here is amazing.  I couldn't recommend it enough.  Chaya can be a bit pricey just as most sushi is, but it is definitely worth it!  I definitely look forward to a meal at Chaya whenever I revisit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I love their maki rolls, pork katsu, and Nabeyaki Udon. Very authentic and fresh, and the quality of the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Service slow. Once you have had sushi  at the Penn Avenue Fish Market, all else pales in comparison."}
{"text":"Sushi in Pittsburgh is a daunting task. Knowing fully that wherever I go, nothing will fulfill my pretentious standards from my summers in San Francisco, I still attempt to remain open to whatever options this city might offer. And so, I've tried it all, from the egregiously overpriced option in Station Square, to the fishy (pun!) deals in South Oakland, and everything in between (including the all-you-can-eat turned all-you-can-poop travesty along 51).  Chaya was, in my opinion, pretty alright. I got the chirashi--the fish was good, the rice was tasty, the salad and soup were standard. Because lately I'm into lists, two things set Chaya apart from its competitors:  1. The wasabi is home-made. Yes, sweet Lord, yes. This delicious treat does not come from a tubed container, and it is recommended that you do not mix it in with the soy sauce. Rather, apply it directly to your sushi. Or, eat it plain like I did. It's delicious.  2. The management is warm and friendly and eager to refill your tea. I'm sure this experience may change depending on the night, but it definitely made our meal feel much more relaxed.  I'm not going to rave about this place (except for the wasabi), but it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents the other night. My whole family is crazy about sushi, so we always have high expectations. This is easily the best sushi I've ever had in Pittsburgh. If you get a sushi platter, you get an excessive amount of food. My parents and I loved this place! The quality and presentation of the food was fantastic. The ambiance/environment is okay, but the food more than makes up for it"}
{"text":"Decided to try takeout here. Had shrimp teriyaki dinner which included shrimp (obviously) but on a skewer (pointless) with rice and salad. The shrimp was cooked well however the teriyaki was separate and required me pouring it on. This meal is average at best and certainly not worth $23."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best things come in small packages. This small, and beautifully decorated restaurant fully satisfied my sushi craving! With dozen of sushi, sashimi, and vegetable roll options you could literally make any sushi lover happy. Good size portions for excellent prices! The only thing was because it was so small there was a bit of a wait, but definitely worth the time!"}
{"text":"This is a small very authentic Japanese restaurant. The food is excellent and the service is very attentive. The menu has many food choices both classic \"American style fair\" as well as items that are more suited towards the Japanese palate. Items are marked with an \"*\" or two to signify authentic dishes. The restaurant will allow you to bring your own wine or beer, (for a small fee), and there are a few stores within walking distance that sell these items. If you are a sushi lover and not too ambitious I would suggest you just have the sushi which is a great value for the price. choices come a la carte or as a dinner. The dinner includes a nice salad, miso soup and some pieces of dark meat chicken that have been breaded and deep fried. If you are a lover of Japanese cuisine you will enjoy the value, service and most of all the food."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for a while. So finding a good sushi place is hard. I used to come here when I was in college and a little after college. I used to love this place because it was almost as good as eating sushi in japan. Fresh and authentic. But I haven't been here in a while because the last time I ate here it was a horrible experience. The fish was not fresh and the rice just tasted like I was drinking vinegar. The prices have gone up a lot, which normally I don't really care as long as the food is good. But I haven't been back since that bad experience."}
{"text":"First of all, be there early at dinner time because there will be a LONG line. The price is slightly higher than many other \"normal\" sushi places but trust me Chaya really deserves the price. Sushi and sashimi are authentic and come in fresh. Every piece of salmon and tuna gently licks your tongue. The sushi rice is moderate and suits the ingredients well. The wasabi is a little bit dry and powder-wise, but how could you criticize that if you are not in Japan?"}
{"text":"One of authentic Japanese restaurant in town!!! The price is a bit high but you'll never regret it. The food is so good fresh and delicious. I've ordered the fried oysters, it's really yummy."}
{"text":"Chaya is the place to go in Pittsburgh for authentic Japanese food. Upon entering the restaurant, I was instantly transported back to Japan. You know it's the real deal when the waitresses are wearing kimonos and the owner/sushi chef is chatting with patrons in Japanese. To further enhance the authenticity, they gave my friend and I warm toilettes to wipe our hands. Our waitress was so nice and did not rush us into deciding. My friend I decided on sharing the Deluxe Sushi and Sashimi combination. The course started off with a tasty Japanese salad with ginger dressing and miso soup (which was a tad underseasoned of miso). The next appetizer was Japanese styled fried chicken. Although the pieces were small, they were perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. I highly recommend adding the lime that comes with it to further enhance the fried chicken.   When the star of the course came, I was excited. The presentation was very simple and divided the sushi by section. The platter included 6 pieces of maki, 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of California roll, and two pieces of different sized salmon roe. The type of fish offered were: salmon, tuna, fluke, shrimp, and yellowtail. I was very impressed by the freshness of the fish and the appropriateness of the thickness of the nigiri and sashimi.   I would give Chaya 5 out of 5 star for not the following two reasons. I didn't think that the California roll was made correctly with the rice around the seaweed paper being too thinly layered. My other reason is that I've had better (curse my food background in NYC). For Pittsburgh, this is definitely the place. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I highly recommend getting a combination because the progression of the meal is an experience. When the sushi comes, it immediately grabs your attention even though it's not filled with fancy vegetables."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is tucked away on Murray Street. The first thing you notice is the charming and cozy decor. The second thing you notice are the beautiful kimonos that the servers wear. I haven't been out to try anything new lately, and this was a wonderful experience to inspire my interest in \"trying new things\" again.   The food came out at a steady pace with appetizers and our main meals. Presentation is stunning on all accounts.   I'm a vegetarian so I ordered fried tofu, vegetable tempura roll, and avocado roll. My friends ordered beef udon, gyoza, regular sushi and sashimi, Edamame, and various other little things. Despite not eating meat, I could appreciate how beautifully prepared everything was. If you've ever watched a Studio Ghibli film, you know how absolutely perfect all of the food looks - from the steam rising from a soup to the crispy edges of fried chicken and the perfectly placed grains of rice on a sushi roll - our food was exactly like that. It was almost too pretty to eat!   Service was polite. The food is affordable. There's no fuss here. It's quality food, accessible from various bus lines and parts of the city, and an experience I look forward to having in the future."}
{"text":"I came here only because this place got such great reviews... and i was extremely disappointed.  The atmosphere is awful, it feels like a cheap dining room. The service is mediocre... we had no soy sauce at our table, so the waitress picked a container of soy sauce up from another table and brought it to us, and it was about 90% emptry so we had to ask for more again...  The sushi was fresh, but not really creative. I guess this place gets good reviews for having \"fresh fish\". But why shouldn't a sushi place have fresh fish? I don't think this restuarant should be rewarded for having something it is supposed to have. I don't think I will go back unless i am specifically in the neighberhood."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Definitely my favorite in Pittsburgh. We got a large selection of maki and thoroughly enjoyed every roll. The rice was perfectly cooked, the fish was extremely fresh, and the hand grated wasabi was a fresh alternative to the reconstituted wasabi powder that you get at most sushi places.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good authentic sushi. The fried chicken is really tasty too. Seaweed salad is always good. I have had a stew there that I was happy with. When we want good Japanese or Sushi we go here. I love it."}
{"text":"I tried sashimi deluxe, not fresh, some pieces were too cold and little hard because some ice in it. Maybe trying sashimi in Pittsburg is not a good idea."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls! Tried the shrimp tempura roll and the squirrel hill roll. Everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"not bad for pittsburgh. very nice to actually see a japanese chef serve some real traditional japanese food. they had natto and he was very surprised that i had ordered and was actually happy to serve it with some tuna for me. the fact that they do Omakase there makes it authentic, its good to know that is an option for people to have chef's \"trust me\" style dinners. better than most sushi places in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed by this sushi experience, especially for the price. We ordered the salmon lover combo, tempura, and cold green tea soba noodles. That came out to $75 for two people.  Now, let me tell you what you can get for $74 before tax, including tip, in Los Angeles. You can get the \"Trust Me\" tasting menu at Sugarfish, one of the country's best sushi restaurants. The preset menu includes an assortment of the BEST cuts of sushi fish direct from the market that very morning. Here, however, I felt like I had picked up some sushi at the grocery store and brought it home.  You can definitely find better sushi and also cheaper sushi, which, in this case, I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is probably a special occasion type of place, but the food is great and service is pleasant. Probably a great place for a date.   I think it's Japanese owned, which is rare nowadays for a sushi restaurant, unless i've been fooled and its Korean or Chinese owned, but the sushi chef spoke Japanese as did the servers. The servers wear kimonos too which is cute.   The meals (soup, chicken kaarage, salad, tempura, and main entree - noodles or sushi) are great, and they come with alot of food. It's a little pricy, but you get good quality with it."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. The fish texture of my salmon was unpleasant. The service was average. No one at the table finished their meals, and no take-away boxes either. Although I've had worse food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"bang for the buck\", only want sushi (and not other Japanese food), and don't mind slightly less variety, Tokyo in Bloomfield should be your first stop.  If you're looking for the best Japanese food in Pittsburgh, Chaya is it.  This is the best Japanese restaurant I've had the chance to try.  If you like sushi, you should go here and try this.  Even in the new location, there's often a wait, so don't show up starving; that said, the wait is worth it, and the food is awesome.  We've yet to find a bad pick on the menu.  5-stars; as good as it gets."}
{"text":"After hearing from friends and reading so many good reviews about the place, we went last week. The Sushi was very good but it is definitely on the pricy side."}
{"text":"A bit pricy. The food isn't so good to match with the price. I ordered fried tofu and katsudon, but the taste was just so so. I think Tan Izakaya might be a better choice for Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Expensive but fresh and worth the money. They're always busy for a reason!! So delicious and consistent, anytime I want Japanese sushi Chaya always hits the spot. My husband and I have been to Japan and had amazing sushi at Michelin star restaurants and Chaya is comparable to those places. Not only is their sushi to die for but all their other dishes are authentic also. The owner is Japanese (the sushi chef) and most of the workers are Japanese also, makes you feel like you're in Japan! I'd recommend any of the deluxe sushi platters, the tonkatsu, any broiled fish-- if you want to try then all they offer a mini set for $50ish/person!! Best sushi in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very good. A very traditional variety of options. I especially liked the toro ngiri. The service, however, was very slow and our server was very rude and short with us. The atmosphere is traditional Japanese, with lots of bamboo and kimonos as outfits for the servers. It would have been a great experience had the service been more professional. The BYOB option is nice to bring in a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Ah, Yelp. ya let me down, big time.   High prices. Small portions. But worst of all, tasteless sushi. Perhaps I'm spoiled as a New Yorker by very many excellent sushi restaurants (and Pittsburghers who love this place spoiled by a lack of other Sushi venues in the 'Burgh), but my experience here was really poor.  The Deluxe Sushi was more expensive than in New York, yet consisted of fewer and tinier pieces. I'd like to say their tagline should be \"New York prices without New York quality\" but they don't offer New York quality or portions; perhaps it costs a lot to transport raw fish to Pittsburgh?  So if you're visiting friends or colleagues in Squirrel Hill and someone suggests sushi, wait til you get back to NYC or California."}
{"text":"Chaya is going to be on my go to list for Japanese food. Service was nice and the food was good at a very great price. We arrived at about 8pm on a Saturday night and only waited for a few minutes. They gave us some moist toilettes to cleanse our hands. We were craving sushi, udon and tempura. I thought I would have to choose one or two of the three though we spotted the sushi and tempura udon combination for two - perfect. There was a lot of food: salad w/ ginger dressing, an assortment of about a dozen sushi rolls (I was pretty full by then..), tempura, some fried chicken pieces and then a bowl of udon. I was stuffed! And all of this food for the two of us was only $35. Woot!! My only gripe was that the wasabi was very mushy."}
{"text":"I've had sushi boat here with one of my friend. The fish was not fresh at all and I feel like I've got ripped off! I don't think I am ever going back here again. I am a raw fish/sashimi person. I don't usually eat cooked/warm Japanese. Maybe their rice ball or warm dish are better. However, the only good thing I liked at this restaurant is their WASABI! I have to admit I loved it!   Is it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"After eating in son many sushi restaurants. This place have the best sushi in Pittsburgh! Really. Makes me want to come back. I'm there with my husband almost every other Saturday night! Definitely recommend. Nice for couples."}
{"text":"Before Chaya, I had been \"off\" sushi for I don't know how many years. I guess I had just eaten at too many not-so-good sushi restaurants. My wife had heard great things about Chaya, so I thought I'd give sushi one more try.  I'm glad I did. The sushi here was delicious. I can't recall exactly all that we had, but it was all fantastic. We'll definitely be going back again. And again.  Like some of the other reviewers have said, it IS small, so expect to wait on busy nights. But it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for sushi. We had the tuna roll and added spicy sauce to it, the eel roll, the squirrel hill roll, the spider roll, and the tropical tempura roll. 9 rolls and 2 teas cost us about $60 which isn't bad in my opinion. The sushi menu is listed on the table rather than in the menu book. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The decor looked traditional and the other dishes around us looked so delicious! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After a few greasy meals it was nice to have a break with some sushi. I didn't think that I would be eating sushi in Pittsburgh, but I have to say that the freshness impressed me.  One gripe that I have it that with the BYO policy, the charges for the ice bucket, and glassware amounted to about a bottle of sake we had just brought. does it really cost a restaurant $2 to wash a sake glass? Come on now."}
{"text":"I hear this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  I believe this, but it's a shame, because it's not great.  It wasn't bad, but the quality of the food was on the low side of average.  The restaurant is small, they were understaffed for a Friday night, and there was a long wait (over 40 minutes, and they don't take reservations unless they know you - that is, we were told they don't take reservations, yet while we were waiting, we did observe a reservation being seated, so the details are not clear).  Also, it was expensive for what it was.  The meal was not unpleasant, but for the price, the food quality was not up to par.  Another thing I'll mention is that for a restaurant as popular as this one, there is no excuse that they do not have a liquor license (it's BOYB), particularly when the food type being served is so well complimented by beer and/or sake.  In my opinion, they should spend a little bit more - hire another employee so they're not understaffed, get a wine and beer license, and buy fresher fish (or waste the old fish/rotate stock more frequently) to ultimately provide the customer with a higher quality experience.  They have these options, and chose not to do them.  I'm sure they make plenty of money, judging by what they charge and how busy they were, and it's our money that supports them as customers.  If you're willing to accept less quality, that's what you'll get, so my advice would be: just don't go there until they improve service and quality.     As a customer, I choose to demand a better product, and won't be back.  If it were cheap, it might have been worth it, but it's just a bad value."}
{"text":"I was traveling to Pittsburgh on a business trip and had no idea where to eat, thanks to Yelp I found Chaya's and decided to check it out.  The place is a bit small but has a quaint atmosphere, and I loved that all the servers are dressed in Japanese couture.  I'm never a fan of sitting alone, but the server came over and was immediately friendly.  He noticed that I was wearing a race shirt and we started discussing our running history (his was far more impressive than mine!).  I wasn't starving, so I opted to grab an appetizer and a roll.  I went with the veggie tempura and an eel, cucumber, and avocado roll.  I found the tempura to be just right, but I wasn't in love with the tempura sauce (then again I'm not exactly an expert).  The sushi was fantastic and I was upset I didn't opt for more.  After completing those I considered getting some nigiri, the waiter was happy to make recommendations.  I tried the Toro, extremely fatty but delicious.  The service was fantastic and the sushi was reasonably priced.  If I were traveling back to Pitt, I'd definitely consider stopping in Chaya's again and trying a wider variety of sushi."}
{"text":"Chaya is very good.  Not the best I've ever been to, but very good, especially for Pittsburgh.  The ingredients are extremely fresh, and the place is run by a Japanese family; something that's become rare in many places these days.  Please go here over Nakama, and don't use Nakama as your \"baseline\" sushi experience.    It's affordable, and very authentic, and acceptable portion size.  Granted, I haven't been to Japan yet(on my to do list) but I consider myself well-versed on sushi.  FYI, if you take your wasabi and put it directly in your shoyu, please stop.  Or at least don't write a sushi review!  They also let you bring in outside wine, but they do charge a small corkage fee."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Chaya since they moved. The new space is a lot bigger and the food is still fantastic.  The ingredients are all top notch -- right down to the fresh wasabi! Nothing flashy here. It's just authentic, high quality Japanese food. Easily the best sushi in Pittsburgh. The tempura is great too. I need to come back more often to try more of the non-sushi items."}
{"text":"Chaya does good sushi, probably the best quality in the city. You're going to pay for that quality though--it's hard to walk out without spending at least $20 per person, and you can spend much, much more. They also have an assortment of otherwise-hard-to-find appetizers, which are solid, but I would recommend the sushi above anything else. I you get the seared tuna, you're in for quite a treat."}
{"text":"over priced,and not worth waiting for if there is a long line.  very noisy and somewhat slow"}
{"text":"I went there twice, hoping the second time would be better than the first.  Same experience.  I don't know how others think this place is good.  Everything tasted like an all you can eat sushi buffet.  Poor quality. Sushi was dry.  Rice was dry.  The chicken pieces served are disgusting, small chewy chicken pieces.  KFC chicken is better."}
{"text":"After nearly 4 years I've finally ventured out to Chaya.  What took me so long?  I'm always mildly hesitant about seafood when I'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.  Three of us ordered a roll combination platter to split as well as our own food.  I ordered yellowtail cheeks, my friend ordered eel, and my last friend is boring.  First came the salad.  It was pretty standard, but any sign of vegetation is a good thing for the college male.  Next up was their karaage.  Ohmygoodness it was the best karaage I have ever had.  Now I've never had karaage in Japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and I was scared it would be a letdown.  The flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  Drool.  Miso soup was also pretty standard.  The roll combination was a disappointment.  Yes, we had it coming for ordering a platter of rolls, but it was only b/c the sushi/sashimi platters would have either been too big (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  In retrospect we should have just ordered a la carte Nigiri...  I noticed halfway through the meal they had Anago available that night too...  My yellowtail cheeks were delicious.  Personally I love fish cheeks (as well as the part of fish right by the tail when I order fish whole).  It's super tender and rich and tastes so delicate.  My end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  I would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the roll combination and I had picked up a piece of Toro and a piece of Anago instead.  Service was excellent and the their timing was impeccable; they have it all down to an art.  The next time I'm back I completely want to try their Omakase.  In Japanese it means \"It's up to you\" with \"you\" being the chef.  I was slightly disappointed when I saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy sauce and completely mix it up.  That is not how sushi should be eaten....."}
{"text":"My bf heard about this place from a Japanese lady as she said this restaurant is among the most authentic Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh. So we decided to give it a try. Definitely a gem! The restaurant is very cute in its entirety, love all the decorations! I ordered boiled black cod (as they ran out of duck udon and fried oyster dish) and it is very delicious (a little bit fishy smell but wouldn't hurt). My bf had sushi deluxe including fat/lean tuna, salmon, sea urchin, eel, etc and it was huge! The food was a bit pricey but deserve the price (as they even charge for hot water...). Next time will try their matcha cheesecake and sukiyaki!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad sushi in terms of proper rolling,  loose rolled and falling apart (maybe that is because we arrived 30 minutes before close?), semi rude staff (again maybe because of when we walked in?), and finally there's no liquor available which wasn't the end of the world, but no hot sake? Cmon dude get it together. There's places in town that beat this place on every aspect of their service. Don't bother."}
{"text":"We arrived early on a Friday night and the place was Packed.. After a short wait we were seated. It was apparent that our server was very busy and had too many tables but she still provided decent service. The menu is simple and we ordered sushi and some dessert. The sushi was very good. Not the crazy sushi that has become all the rage with rolls as big as your fist, just plain old simple sushi focused on good fish. It was a nice change of pace. The rolls were reasonably priced as was the rest of the menu.  We both said we would definitely come back and we liked the atmosphere."}
