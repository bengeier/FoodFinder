{"text":"The owner is so attentive and welcoming.The service is great.The hookah is amazing and the flavors are fresh, one of the best hookah lounges I have ever been.The music is just on point. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place makes the best hookas that you will ever have in your life. The last time I experienced a hookah as good as this, it was in Lebanon. Ask for an ice hookah and let Ramsy make you a special mix"}
{"text":"This place is bulshit i stopped to get some tea and they didn't serve it to me because i didn't get a hookah such a bad costumer service"}
{"text":"Quick service. Very attentive and nice staff. Definitely one of those places to hang out. Has a decent selection of flavors and brands."}

{"text":"Good clean hookah. And the owner is very friendly and nice. I enjoyed it, and definitely will come back again.  I do recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"And this is why I go to Oasis Cafe in Scottsdale!! Never waste your money here, heard from a inside source they don't change their water for at least a couple days hence why the hookah never hits. You always have to ask for coals, and when you do they give you attitude about it. The owner picks favorites which is great if we were 15, his favorite game is letting everyone else have outside drinks, except certain people; you will have to buy his drinks. Currently at another hookah bar enjoying our outside drinks :) They will also make you move around 2 or 3 times to make room for more people, forget about first come first serve lol it's a joke here!! You will be  ignored to the point, where you have to ask for everything, what kind of business is that"}
{"text":"Quality and hospitality went down the drain. Subsequently, I'm removing my 5 star review and photos."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing place with some of the nicest people. I had a few hours to kill before my flight and came here.  Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun little joint to hang out at! The owners were really helpful and took song requests. They have a good sound system in there which is nice. We didn't get a chance to try too many flavors but the ones we had were good. We just wished this lounge had served alcohol."}
{"text":"Ramsey is the best owner I've best over I've cover come across. He takes care of you and makes sure you have the best experience no matter what best hookah bar ever I got wild when I came in .. definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Pros: Great location. Good music   Cons: Horrible service. Old hookahs that don't work properly. Over priced."}
{"text":"We got the blue mist which is the best one in my opinion. Highly recommend, it's clean, great atmosphere and comfortable furniture. The owner even changed the music to accommodate us. Amazing service!"}
{"text":"Inlove with this hookah lounge, I honestly consider it my 2nd home!!!!!! Everyone is friendly there and the owner (ahmad) is such a nice, respectful, and humble person. The service is amazing and its definitely a YES TO GO THERE! The prices aren't expensive as the other hookah lounges, and they don't charge per flavor like hubbly bubbly, pita house ..... trust me MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Great hookah!! Great service!! I will continually come back here. Better than any other hookah lounge in the valley. I would recommend this to all my friends. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Tempe all my life. I've been to every hookah lounge in the valley and this is the best I've seen since Almaza. I'm honestly impressed. Service is great Bowls lasted 3 hours without feeling harsh AT ALL Flavors are amazing Everything was way above expected"}
{"text":"Great hookah great atmosphere ,reasonable price . Great music nice service ... Best flavored , you can requested your music , ask for your student discounts , their bathroom are so clean I really like this place and I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I moved to Tempe around 6 months ago. Naturally I ventured to multiple hookah lounges around the area to find a new a weekend spot expecting the worst. When it comes to a chill, relaxing atmosphere and price none of the local lounges compare to Alibaba. The staff is always attentive and constantly on top of coal changes, which any avid hookah goer knows is the most critical factor to any lounge's success. The owner is very kind and welcoming, which is a rare quality in most lounges that seem more concerned about running their business for friends and family rather than costumers. The hookah selection is superabundant and the quality is of the highest tier. Alibaba is a diamond in the rough. If you're new to the area I would definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Straight ass do not go to this hookah lounge was like those 7$ vapes you buy from a Dollar store"}
{"text":"Another great area hookah spot. Great prices, service and shisha. Clean and new.  The tea with mint is also delicious and a perfect pairing. Recommend fumari lemon mint.   Place also has an Xbox One for patrons to take advantage of."}
{"text":"Real chill place.  I hung out here for hours while waiting for my flight.  The hookah was good and the customer service was even better."}
{"text":"Great spot to enjoy some hookah. Amazing music, relaxing vibes and the owner is a very nice guy. You have the option of playing FIFA as well as watching TV while you smoke your hookah."}
{"text":"Ahmed is so nice and really helped me and my friends out. Thanks for the fun Thursday night!"}
{"text":"Best Hookah in town, close to campus so very convenient for students. Service is awesome. They got a pool table now so it's also fun to spend hours at this place, they also have a chess set. I dare you to challenge the owner at chess... and me."}
{"text":"Moved out to Tempe about a year ago and tried a few different hookah lounges. None of them compare to Alibaba, when you're here they treat you like you are part of the family. Their hookahs are always smooth and they are always around to check to make sure you are doing good. If you wanna be treated like you don't matter to to another lounge but if you wanna feel rested right come here. You will not regret it"}
{"text":"It was a pretty standard cozy hookah lounge. It's nice chilling here and just hanging out. The people are nice!  The music was a little distracting, it was a little pricey and our hookah didn't work right the first time around. :/"}
{"text":"Great service. I got sat immediately and ordered the lemon mint fumari. Great flavor and big smoke. Ordered fresh made lemonade and relaxed. The bowl lasted long and I was overall satisfied. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best hookah lounges I've ever been to. The owner is very attentive and makes sure every customer is satisfied and gives you the best service I've ever endured. I highly recommend this hidden gem and can say they make you feel like family from the second you walk in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love Na√Øf! He knows so much about hookah and I had an awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the going rate for hookah is but this place seemed pretty reasonable to me. We had one refill and the price was a tad over $20.   Service was decent too. We were asked a few times if we needed a refill and when we said yes, it took about 10 minutes.   The place isn't kept very clean though. Gross bathroom too. I'll call it one step above a gas station bathroom. Not sure why another review was raving about it."}
{"text":"Super chill. Dark and can be intimate. Hookah is smooth and the service is good.   All couches and chairs so you're comfy! First hookah I've been too since I've been to Arizona in the last 3 years. Definitey coming back!"}
{"text":"The absolutely BEST hookah lounge in the valley. Actually, the STATE. I've been to almost every single one in the valley but none better than here. Owner walks around and talks to the customers and makes you feel at home. They have pool and chess for you to play as you smoke. Best tobacco money can buy at very competitive prices.  Owner always gives suggestions on what to smoke and literally tops the previous suggestion every time. Not a single complaint, only praises. I could live here and be completely content. Nice area, and not a single problem parking my corvette outside.   Good music, tobacco, and company. Would recommend this hookah bar to every friend, neighbor, or pedestrian that speaks of a hookah bar. Ali Baba is the place to be at all times."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere and peices. The price is also awesome and they have a student discount making it even better."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome. There is a young lady that is super helpful and knowledgeable. We couldn't decide on a flavor so she picked one for us, and it was great!   I love the atmosphere. It's nice that there are some bored games available to play while you smoke. My favorite feature is the pool table!"}
{"text":"Great environment. The owner is super friendly. Fairly priced. The height of hookah bars in Tempe. P.S-Ask about the student discount."}
{"text":"By far one of my \"must do\" in the #phx area #alibabahookah #hookak #hookahlife #hookahtime #shisha #shishalife #shishatime #tea #mustdo #relaxing #greatservice #alibaba #Ramses is a great host. The environment is welcoming! A hit with locals and some nearby food places make this a great night out!!!"}
{"text":"Place sucks they have no place seat and the hookah is expensive and you should never go there !!"}

{"text":"If you want a place to hang out you'll want to come in and have fun with friends and you'll love the hookah flavors and great service there"}
