{"text":"What is the deal. Walked into the restaurant Sunday afternoon and the guy at the cash register kept saying what can we do for you can we help you?, really what do you walk into a restaurant for, directions to the zoo?
A blatant crappy attitude put his arms up and had a goofy attitude. The three of us were astonished at his attitude and walked out and went to Yours Truly.
With that type of arrogance we saw why there was a wait for Yours Truly and Aladdin's was dead.
This guy needs a big attitude adjustment the other Aladdin's we visited previously did not have this stupid behavior."}
{"text":"Great place to eat lunch (and dinner). This is my favorite--at least of two Aladdin's. I also eat at the Independence location sometimes on the way back from the airport.. it's good as well.

The choices in food are pretty healthy. Probably about the best healthy alternative available without going crazy at some vegan soybean yogurt falafil place. Not my cup of tea anyhow.

When I first started going for lunch years ago (about 1x/week) there were good waitresses, the food was consistently good, and was always prompt, etc. The thing with Aladdin's [food quality] is that it can vary.. from good to decent to once in a while \"umm, okay\". Sadly the wait staff has seemed to lose it's formula (much like Yours Truly a couple doors down). No offense but I happen to enjoy being waited on by a young/perky waitress in skin-tight pants. Maybe the young kids don't want/need to work?? Either way the seemingly more frequent ogre sightings are a letdown.. not just here but a lot of places.

Anyhow, the desserts are awesome. I have one once in a while. You really need to split one with someone tho.

Also, Rafael (manager/owner?) is super-nice and always makes me feel extremely welcome. I've been there enough to know that's how he really is--he's not trying to push/sell you something. Great guy tho. Really makes the restaurant feel special for me."}
{"text":"Aladdin's, as the name would imply, is a middle eastern restaurant. It's a nice, comfortable, restaurant where you can find many unusual dishes. I've been there several times and I have never been disappointed. The food is excellent and well prepared. The service is good although keep in mind this really isn't that big of a place so it can be somewhat crowded at times. Having said that, the wait has never been excessively long. 
Whenever I am looking for a nearby restaurant with good non american food, served hot,  reasonably priced and with a casual atmosphere Aladdin's is a go to place."}
{"text":"Been a here a few times, most recently today...

Shared a falafel app with the Mrs, then I had the chicken chili and Mrs had the \"Len-chili\"... which is the Lentil soup/ chili version of a Black & Tan.  As always, the falafel was perfectly crisp, yet moist inside with just a bit of kick.  The chicken chili was superb, with a rich base.  I wasn't as keen on the len-chili... IMO the lentil soup washed the chili out.  

Per usual, prompt and courteous service and a reasonable check... Aladdin's, please move down to East 4th!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently superb! Excellent choices with salads, soups, wraps, tahini, hummus, and more. Service is top notch and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and awesome food. The hummus is the best I have ever tasted, ask for a side of hot sauce. Food is fresh and very tasty. Everything I've had has been great! Can't miss for lunch or dinner. Great spot for takeout as well."}
{"text":"All you can ask for in a quick, healthy lunch. I'm always stuffed after one of their generous salads. Aladdin's is nothing fancy; it's just a great little neighborhood spot where the staff never fails to smile when you walk in the door. For these reasons, it's easily a staple for me."}
{"text":"It is really wonderful meditrani an  food experience start with nice Arabic music then the hummus is really delicious with warm bread pita then the hot dwali and the kubbah it was really testy in which 3 pice was not enough to satisfy us so we order a second one then we enjoy the main entree my combo was delicious and perfectly cooked  I recommend it and jasmine shawarm .
I will be back soon to this restaurant every time I miss my home food"}
{"text":"This is a great place! The hummus with the hot sauce is wonderful. Also the rolled pitas are amazing. They have so many wonderful flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"The food and service were decent. The big issue for me was the mold on the cheesecake. Their desserts look so good upon entry, and then whamo - mold. The most jarring thing was after I pointed out the mold to the server, he replied, \"yeah, that's why I highlighted the other desserts. The cheesecake slices are the last piece of a cake to sell.\" Um... okay. Staff should be regularly checking those individual slices then. That's like, not sanitary. I give him credit for playing it cool - he was generally a good waiter, but really the manager should have done something when the waiter pointed it out to him."}
{"text":"Very good relatively healthy food. Never tried anything I didn't like. Really like the Kibbie and their garlic sauce tastes great on just about any of their dishes. Kind of pricy when feeding the whole family though."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back to this restaurant.   I ordered the V-Nine soup and the Taza salad.   Delicious, delicious.   The salad was so delicious I really did not need the dressing.   And our server, Matt, was so knowledgeable about the menu and welcoming.   Will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been trying to get me to try this place forever now...so I finally gave in and we went to lunch here last week. I wish I had given in a lot sooner, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

When looking at the menu and knowing this is a chain (local, but still a chain) I didn't really have high expectations. Well I am glad to say that I was wrong.

I ordered a hummus which came with a side of pita. The pita was your average store bought tasting pita, it was fresh, not dried out like you get at some places. The hummus was okay, it was kind of plain tasting but still pretty decent. After a few boring bites the server asked if I would like some hot sauce, so I said sure (never had hot sauce with my hummus but thought it might add some flavor). I absolutely loved the hot sauce. It was so delicious. It tasted like no other hot sauce I have ever had before, my guess is that they make it themselves which is a huge plus. It had a vinegary flavor with the perfect amount of spice, not too hot not too mild. I couldn't get enough of it. 

When our main meal came out, we both ordered the rolled Chicken Shawarma, I just had to get more of that hot sauce. The shawarma was good enough on its own, but like I said the hot sauce was delicious...and only made the Shawarma better. So about the Shawarma, it consisted of marinated char-grilled chicken with tomato and onion topped with a Tahini Yogurt dressing all rolled up in a toasted pita. In my opinion the serving size is enough for two meals especially if you have an app. The chicken cooked to perfection, the pita perfectly toasted all of that with the Tahini dressing, everything just went together amazingly well. 

The only complaints I have is when I took the other half of my pita home and ate it hours later, one side of the pita was a little tough (hard) to bite through...so perhaps it doesn't travel well. My other complaint is that when the server asked me if I wanted hot sauce, I thought it was free. Well I guess only the first one was free, because when I got the check I was charged for the second. It was only .65 cent not a big deal, but I think she should have told me there was a charge for it, especially since she was the one who offered it in the first place.

Fortunately these complaints are hardly enough to keep me from going back. The food was just that good.

The service was quick and friendly, which is nice when you're on a lunch break and need to get back to work. The prices were reasonable. Two shawarmas, two sodas and hummus came to about $30.00 (with tip)."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food. It was good, but I can barely remember what I had, due to the ridiculous foul up when my party went to pay. There were three of us on one bill. Two paid cash, and I asked the waitress to put $20 on my debit card. Remember this amount. The waitress comes back and says that the person who was handling the transaction was having difficulty and had run one transaction for $16.00. That wasn't what we had asked. She goes back to sort it out, then returns, stating that another transaction for $42.00 had been run. I go up to the register and the real fun begins. Lana, the night manager, insists that both charges have been voided. She was unable to explain why they had been rung up in the first place. I use my phone to check my bank account and guess what? The charges were already pending! I show this to Lana, who insisted she had never put the charge through. We argue about it for at least three or four minutes, then finally I went back to the table. I was fed up and figured it was not worth arguing with this obtuse woman any longer. I am shocked when she *follows*  me to the table! To make matters worse, she knocks a glass of water over on my phone! I yell at her, \"just get away from me!\", as I grab my phone out of the puddle. At NO TIME does Lana ever apologize for the messed up charges or the wet phone. Lana instead continues to argue with our whole table, stating she was not dishonest etc. I never accused her of that, she was just stupid and unprofessional. The waitress did come over and apologize profusely, but it was nothing she did or had control over. I had to call the manager the next day to get my account credited. He sort of apologized, but it was not very heartfelt. Most places would have offered a free meal after a fiasco like that (not that I wanted one, I don't even live in the area, but the gesture would have been appreciated). Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Finally, one of the few authentic Arabic restaurants. The staff are great. We are twice there: once lunch to go and another was only desserts and coffee. Dishes we loved were dawali (stuffed grape leaves), baklava cheesecake (delicious), and kebba (quality is vey high, highly  recommended). The atmosphere is nice but I prefer the outside tables."}
{"text":"One of the many Aladdin's you can choose from around town. This is the location I frequent the most. It's one of the most consistent Mediterranean cuisine's in Northeast Ohio. The service is always very good and everyone is always friendly. They have a very large menu with lots to choose from. Everything is fresh and it's pretty easy to eat healthy here. Some of my favorite items is there hummus, Soups, great salads or their pita rolls. I love that they offer fresh fruit smoothies as well and if you have a sweet tooth they have fantastic desserts. The price point is average and the store is always very clean. So if you want a Quick, relatively inexpensive and healthy meal I definitely recommend this place. Also it is very good for take out."}
{"text":"I love Aladdin's. Really I do. But the last visit at this location was substandard. Three of us ordered soups for our meals and by the time we were served, all 3 were all lukewarm. The server was new and put in the soup orders at the same time as the appetizers, although we asked for the soups to be served as entrees. Other than this snafu, the prior visits and meals at Aladdin's have been consistently 4 stars. They have a ton of healthy and vegetarian options. The baba is always amazing, try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices.  If you ask for anything special (such as \"omit the yogurt sauce on my wrap\") your server will write it down and the kitchen will ignore it.  So if you are ordering take-out, check your order carefully.  If you are dining in, check your order carefully.  I've eaten here many times, and ordered takeout many times, and the mistakes are consistent.  I come back for the food, not the mistakes."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a local staple. They offer consistently good food and a delightful assortment of desserts. As a vegetarian, I'm partial to the falafel, but my mom swears by the taza chicken salad."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with tasty food and friendly staff.

Freshly squeezed orange juice and apple juice are indeed very fresh with fruit pulp.  Iced raspberry tea is great and free refill.

This is our first time and we took waitress' recommendation and ordered Hummus Shawarma Plate, Mediterranean Shish Kabob Plate, and salad with grilled chicken.  All are delicious.  Baklava combo and tiramisu are good as well.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food and quick! Came in for dinner and was in and out in 30 minutes(I Eat like a pig apparently). For the price, you can't get a better plate of hummus, meat, rice pilaf, salad and falafel."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chicken vegetable soup and mango lassi. The chicken was wonderfully grilled.  The hummus platters are very good as well.  The reasonably authentic food with the restaurant's casual, homey vibe made this a good dining experience.  The service was great but it did take 30 minutes to get our check near the end."}
{"text":"I eat at Aladdins at least once a week and have never had anything that was less than spectacular! I have tried more than half the menu and am always happy with what I order. I consider myself a pretty health conscious person and try my hardest to avoid restaurants that have trans fats, preservatives and other nasty additives in their food, Aladdin's fits the bill in this respect perfectly. I highly recommend the hummus, the Lebanese salata, the V-nine soup with or without chicken, the Jasmine's favorite and any of the fresh squeezed juices or smoothies and baklava. Oh, and I can't forget my most favorite menu item, the carrot smoothie, which is bursting with flavor and nutrients all while enjoying what seems like a treat! The staff is very warm and welcoming and you can tell they are grateful for your business. You must try it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and have eaten at a few other locations.  Love their humus and pita bread!  If you dine in, ask for extra bread, even if you're not hungry and take the leftovers home with you.  The lamb shish kabob is delicious and there's enough rice to last you a few days to boot.  The veggie pitzas are good as well.  Good service, very fast, despite being 1/2-3/4 full and a small place.  Definitely come visit if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Aladdin's offers great Middle Eastern food options for very reasonable prices. Best of all, Aladdin's is a Cleveland-based, independently-owned restaurant chain. The hummus is always delicious, and the \"rolled pitas\" provide customers with smaller portions of Aladdin's large plate dishes (think shawarma) in toasted rolled pitas. 

The service is usually fine; however, I did have a relatively poor service experience during my last visit -- my order was mixed up and I didn't receive the food I actually ordered.

That said, If you're in Cleveland and have a desire for Middle Eastern food, you can't go wrong with Aladdin's Eatery.

Grade: A-"}
{"text":"All around great place, good authentic food at a reasonable price. Garlic sauce is excellent"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Everything on our table was delicious!!!! Our server was an absolute delight! 

If I lived in this area... I would be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat at Aladdins, all the time, this is my least favorite location, but the closest to where I live.   I prefer Independence and Cleveland Heights, where the staff is more personable and the food tastes better.   I don't go to this location often, but I was craving tabboule and didn't have time to journey to another location.   I stopped in on a Saturday, shortly after 11:00 and was seated right away.  I ordered a bowl of vegetable soup and my beloved tabboule.   Both dishes were delivered within a few minutes.   I immediately noticed that the soup looked much different than it normally does.  It was pretty thick (like stew) and the vegetables were mushy and overcooked.  , there were tons of onions and very few potatoes, zucchini, etc.  I'm sure that if was leftover from the previoius day and re-heated.  I pushed it aside and proceeded to eat the tabboule.   The server returned asking if I wanted her to pack up the soup.  I told her no, that it just wasn't very appetizing and went on to mention the texture, etc.   She nodded her head in agreement when I mentioned that it was thick and stew-like and proceeded to take it away and inform the kitchen.   You would have thought that she would have removed it from my check, right?   Especially because I had barely touched it and she seemed to agree that it wasn't right.   Well my check arrived, with the soup included.   I paid and left.  I've had similar experiences here before, which is why I don't go more often than I do.   This location could really take notes from the other 2 locations."}
{"text":"Stopped in (again) with friends from work and we had a great experience. Food was very fresh and delivered fast.  We all shared a medium hummus with fresh veggies and hot oil. Get the oil, it adds a new dimension to the taste of the hummus. My friends got side salads that they said were delicious, and I got a green bean, tomato, garlic, and olive oil. It was lights out good. We all had Pita rolls, and they were cooked and assembled perfectly. If you're looking for a fast healthy bite to eat, Aladdin's in Mayfield Village firs the bill."}
{"text":"Always a good meal.  My husband and I have been here twice, and both times have had excellent food.  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and prices are very reasonable.  I love their pita wraps, especially the chicken shawarma.  The restaurant is clean, and the staff are always very nice and attentive.  The only thing I wish they had was Garlic Paste (Toum).  Friends had told me they did, and I saw \"garlic sauce\" under the dressing and sides portion of their menu.  When we asked if we could get a side of that with bread, the waiter seemed a bit confused.  And now I know why.  The garlic sauce they have is really more of a dressing, not a side, and has the consistency of ranch.  It was still very good and tasted very similar to Toum, but I felt a bit silly dipping bread in dressing.  So, anyone looking for Toum... their garlic sauce is not the same thing."}
{"text":"Decent price, decent food, decent atmosphere, plethora of desserts and the fresh pitas keep me coming back.
Love the tahina sauce and the hummus is not too bad either."}
{"text":"The food is always amazingly fresh and I always have leftovers for a second meal. Everything I've tried, from Aladdin's combo to the falafel and salads, have all been great. They also give you a generous amount of pita bread with everything which I appreciate. 

Ask for their hot sauce, it's so good with the falafel. The person who took my order recommended it and now it's a staple. I don't usually like typical hot sauce but that stuff is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my most visited Aladdin's location since it's close to where I work. I stop in occasionally for lunch with friends and coworkers. I usually come in during their busier hours, but the wait is bearable; I'm usually seated in less than 10 minutes. 

The servers at this location are tentative and takes orders right away. The food comes out pretty quickly. However, if you have special request on your order, the kitchen may sometimes miss the note.

I usually start off with an order of tabouli, which is a salad made with diced tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, onion and garlic all seasoned with olive oil. The tabouli here is excellent; its flavorful and fresh and the portion is very generous. It tastes great with pita bread and really opens your appetite for the main course. My favorite dish here is the \"flavor savor\". It's a dish that has a bit of everything. It has grilled chicken and beef on top of seasoned white rice with vermicelli with a small side of mixed greens, along with hummus and falefel. This dish is full of flavor (hence the name) and different textures. The chicken is tender and nicely seasoned. The beef can be a bit salty, but can be mellowed by the seasoned rice. The hummus also goes well with pita.

All in all, Aladdin's offer great Mediterranean food at a reasonable price. Also, if you're a member of LifeTime fitness, you get 10% off your meals!"}
{"text":"All I need to say is pita & hummus.  The BEST in town!!!  I can't start to review the pastry, I'm already drooling!   Love having an Aladdin's so close to home!  Lucky girl am I!!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian and vegan friendly.  My favs are the chili, V-9 soup, Humus Rolled, and Falafel Humus Rolled. I usually get take out and it's on time and quick. Teas and smoothies are good as well. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Aladdins is great. If you have not been then you should go here for lunch/dinner today/tonight. They have options for everyone. Most recently I have decided i really enjoy the curry roll with chicken inside of it. however, usually we get the flavor saver, some hummus, hot sauce, and a falafel salad.

All of the locations that I have visited have been nearly identical in terms of quality and overall experience.

Waiters are nice. Food is fresh. Calling to order ahead and picking up is super easy and convenient for lunch.

I have been to: This Location, Cedar Rd, Hudson, and Mentor location. I will continue to visit Aladdins!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Locations of this eatery, but this location has proven to be the best! Tuna steak stuffed pita was amazing..... great atmosphere, friendly staff and like all locations, very clean.  
Ps. Oatmeal raisin cookie was a nice pairing with the tuna :)"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is always a decent spot to go to. It's a chain store in Ohio that serves solid food. However, over the years they've definitely been cutting down on the amount of food the serve.

If you're not familiar with Mediterranean food, get the Flavor Savor Special. I've been getting this dish for years now.. it pretty much has a little of everything: rice, jasmine grilled chicken, kafta, falafel, salad, bread and humus. And it's regular priced! The chicken is amazing... i swear they used to give like 5 pieces of chicken and now it's like 3 pieces. But still, this is an awesome dish!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations everything from scratch. A must is the chicken Len chili, my favorite is the salad with tuna but had almost everything on the menu and enjoy it all . Can't go wrong here if you like less traditional food. If you only like wings, pizza or bar food this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Went in at closing time..love the pita bread wrap an tahini...the desert was good but not great... The wrap however was memorable, really amazing.."}
{"text":"Delicious food!
Described as Lebanese-American fushion. I ordered a Pita Kabob Roll for only $7.95 and had 3 good size kabob steaks inside of a mediterranean flavored pita type burrito. It was definitely a modern concept that touched all my taste buds in a good way. There was a garlic sauce that they had along w/ greek yogurt to add some flair to each bite. The steak cook perfectly and had great texture. I also ordered a Lentil soup bringing my total under $10. The lentil soup had traditional flavors while they added some feta cheese on top; which was a pleasant surprise. 
Overall I want to go back and adventure into their menu. 
On my table a German Chocolate cake was also ordered, which was describe as moist and delicate. It looked delicious and home made. 

In addition, I enjoyed the friendly & warm welcoming I received as I entered the restaurant. The server, Waiu, was helpful and nice. She made sure we felt welcomed throughout the entire meal. It was during my lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Never disappointed! Staff is extremely friendly and the food is constantly delicious"}
{"text":"Have been going here since I was a little kid with my family and have always loved it! Always very clean environment and very friendly staff. I always can find a good vegetarian option (Baba Falafel Rolled is the best .)  Always a good place to stop!"}
{"text":"It might be a chain, but this place is such a staple of the Mayfield area with a lot to love. First off, the food is on point. Everything always tastes fresh and authentic. My personal favorites are the chicken dejon wrap and pitza. Their tabouli is the best I've had anywhere and the falafel is very good, and fried in peanut oil which tastes much better. If you want dessert they are great too, and would be worth just going in for a slice of cake. Lots of choices and all very good. I get take out most of the time, but I've eaten there plenty and the staff is great. You can tell they work hard to have a friendly reputation and are always great to the customers. The restaurant is lit well and the ambience is great for bringing a family of a date. Lastly, the prices are pretty hard to beat. If you're looking for middle eastern or someplace new, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Aladdin's has been an institution for me since I came to Cleveland 7 years ago.  There are \"safe\" restaurants and then there are \"safe with style\" restaurants.  I've come to rely on Aladdin's as a place where I can bring friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy some different and interesting foods.  It's a \"safe\" place for me, but it is anything other than boring or basic.

Aladdin's uses high-quality, fresh ingredients and exotic herbs and spices to create huge flavor without going overboard on fat and calories.

The SOM Center location does get busy from time to time, especially at lunch with Progressive so close, but I've fortunately never had a bad service experience.  It's unfortunate that others have - consistency makes a great restaurant great. But my own experiences have been just that - consistent, and consistently great.

At Aladdin's Eatery (any of their locations), you can expect a vibrant atmosphere, healthy food that is big on flavor, and friendly prompt service.

I have not succumbed to the display case of oversized cheesecakes and various other confections, but I do usually take some baklava to go, and it is always delicious.

When the lunch options come up at work, Aladdin's always sounds good."}
{"text":"This is a usual stop for me during lunch. The service is always prompt and the food is always great! Plenty of gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options."}
{"text":"A Middle Eastern eatery located in a suburban safe zone, patrons comfortably dine beneath rainbow colored streaming ribbons, glass block walls, mirrors, neutral colored decor and potted plants. Aladdin's is a welcome option to grabbing a tasteful & inexpensive meal without committing gastric suicide. 

Aladdin's prides themselves on fresh and healthful options. Everything is made from scratch and contains no preservatives. On a recent visit, I scoured the extensive menu of great variety and settled for an appetizer of hummos with a side of their homemade hot sauce.  I also ordered the Greek Pitza which consisted of Feta cheese, zaatar, diced cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, julienne green peppers and slivered calamata olives and garnished with flakes of sweet basil. To drink I had the Green Tea, however they do offer freshly squeezed juices and smoothies that looked tempting. Overall, the meal was fresh, plenty flavorful and seasoned just right.

One bit of irony about this place though is the massively decadent American-stlyed cheesecakes and cakes that are prominently displayed in a dining case by the register. This seems somewhat contradictory to the healthful theme, although the menu also offers smaller Middle Eastern desserts such as baklava. I've yet to cave in to either, although it wasn't because of health reasons, instead it's only because I'm usually stuffed after a meal here."}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot. I liked all menu items thus, except for the hummus, which I wouldn't recommend. It's very plain."}
{"text":"To start the food is always terrific, but to always have wonderful service is just a plus. Rob and the rest of the crew make you feel at home every time you visit I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places..just because of the food. Don't try to go to this place or make a takeout 1.5 hours before they close tho..they pick and choose when they wanna close it seems"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly atmosphere. Sometimes the place is busy and accordingly the service suffers. Don't miss the starters"}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a good place to grab a quick relatively healthy lunch. They have a lot of vegan options, so this location is one of my go to weekday lunch spots. 

I especially like the salads at Aladdin's. There are a lot of different options that leave me feeling full but not so full that I'll fall asleep in my cubicle by 3 pm.

Pro tip - check out the freshly squeezed juice. My personal fave is the carrot juice."}
{"text":"i love aladdins. i've been coming here since i can remember, and its consistently delicious. its a great place to pick up a healthy lunch/dinner, and their take out is great. my favorites are: hummos, v-nine soup, kafta rolled, falafel hummos rolled pita, and the FLAVOR SAVOR!! the flavor savor is the best. you get a sampling of all the greatness alladins has to offer, and its super reasonable, especialy for lunch! get on it."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a quite a while so I was glad to try it out recently for lunch.  I ended up getting there just before their lunch rush so there was no wait.  I ordered the Chicken Shwarma Roll with a side of the hot sauce based on some recommendations in the reviews I had read on here.  

The food came out very quickly and it was very flavorful and fresh.  Overall I'd love to try some more of their menu items and I likely will on subsequent visits I'll be making up in the area.  Their desserts looked amazing, but alas I'm trying to be good and managed the will power to order one to go."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Very friendly staff and the food is excellent. Nice portions, very delicate seasoning, and pleasant presentation. I've had a lot of Middle Eastern food, including restaurants in Istanbul, and this ranks up there with the best of them. If only they had Turkish delight..."}
{"text":"Aladdin's is a great middle-eastern restaurant! We went for dinner at 630pm and were seated promptly. Our waitress Sophia was very welcoming. 

I ordered the Pomegranate Green Tea, which was light and refreshing. We started our dinner with the homemade hummus and hot sauce. It comes with warm pita bread triangles. The hot sauce was awesome and a nice compliment to the hummus. 

I had the Sultan's Shawarma Pitza for my entrée. It is a pita-pizza with perfectly seasoned shawarma meat, sliced onions, tomatoes, diced cucumber and sweet basil topped with Tahini yogurt dressing. 

Don't forget to save room for a slice of their amazing homemade cakes!"}
{"text":"I was traveling for work and stopped here for a salad. The place was clean and the service was really good. I was seated immediately and a server approached me within seconds. There was a dessert display case that had several cakes that looked delicious. I was trying to be healthy so I just ordered a shish kabob salad, which was delicious. The beef was cooked perfectly. The vegetables were fresh and it was topped with feta cheese. The salad was a nice portion and it was served with pita.  The menu had a lot of traditional Lebanese options such as fattoush and lentil stew.  If I am in the area, I will definitely stop here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"When I worked in OH, I would have lunch here a few times a week. The menu is pretty big and everything is a healthy choice (ok, maybe not the monster cheesecakes but everything else). 
I went with an old standby: chicken chili and shishtawook rolled. It's way too much food but soooo worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We went here today (6/22/12) and ordered hummos (yum), the chicken pizza (really nice surprise-usually order the shistawook), chicken-chili (always perfect) and the kid's cheese \"pitza\" with fruit.  The service was amazing; Raphael is very friendly and greeted us immediately.  In addition, our server was extremely attentive.   She really went out of her way to anticipate our needs.  As always, fantastic food, excellent service, nice music and unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"I had better Middle Eastern Food than this. Food is dry and tasteless.  Pretty pricey too."}
{"text":"I completely loved this place. Everything we ordered tasted incredibly fresh and well-balanced as far as seasoning and flavor. The taboulie tasted like somebody picked the ingredients out of their garden and the chicken curry wrap was PERFECT. It's so easy to over-season curry so I really appreciate when someone gets it right. Also the indoor seating space was lovely; super casual, but still a nice place to go have lunch on a sunny day."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here. I ordered the falafel and hummus wrap. The hummus was creamy and well seasoned. It went well with the falafel."}
{"text":"Aladdin's can be relied on for a wide selection of quality, tasty, healthy dishes.

But the service, while always friendly, is WILDLY variable, ranging from \"just fine\" to \"abominable.\" You will be left with no utensils at least 1/3 of the time. Worst case, you'll be forgotten entirely and just have to leave because your order will never be taken. Which is impressive, considering the place is not large. General lack of organization, and dishes arrive wrong a little too often.

They don't post hours, and even if you call to ask, you'll sometimes be given misinformation. They close early randomly, which means you can't count on them being there. That's bad business. I see the temptation to close if nobody's there, but they'd get MORE business if they were reliably open.

It's not just me--my friends are even less tolerant than I am--they've had it with the bad service.

If you can choose a different Aladdin's do so. If not, you can get a good meal here but watch for mistakes and be sure to ask for tableware at the start in case they don't come back."}
{"text":"Aladdins is my favorite in Cleveland, it is hard for me not to order a catering or a takeaway from here at least once weekly. Salads are always fresh.
If you are dining in then my favorite dish is fthe flavor saver . Their cakes are superb too"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Aladdin's in Mayfield Village.  I've been to other Aladdin's restaurants, and have found the food to be consistently excellent in each location I've visited, as was the case in Mayfield Village.  My Jasmine Rice order with chicken thighs has become my main order.  It's always excellent, and the chicken thighs are so flavorful, with no fat.  There were 6 of us at our last visit, and my vegan daughter and her husband also had many selections available to them.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners.  We didn't have dessert.  They're a great place to go after a show, too, as they're often open late."}
{"text":"We stopped for takeout after driving ten miles to the Holiday Inn around the corner, to the great delight and surprise of our mouths and stomachs.  I'm vegetarian and my bedmate is a carnivore, so between the vegetarian appetizer platter and the lamb thing, we both dosed off to sweet dreams with wondrous stomachs.  It was so satisfying that I'm sleeping peacefully as I type this."}
{"text":"JEAAA I got take out here again! (and it was speedy!)

Le mother loved the chicken curry rolled, I only got through 2/3 of the flavor savor with great effort (even though for some reason last time I demolished the sucker), and the baklava is nummy. AND I brought back a 12 oz container of that sexy hot sauce.

The appetizer sampler is big (lots leftover!) and okay, but definitely not worth it if you're getting the flavor savor. i'd recommend a soup or salad instead.

The owner (?) is the person I always see when I go to get pick up (~4). He's a very nice fella."}
{"text":"I can give you four quick and easy reasons why Aladdin's gets 5 stars.  Fresh, healthy food, inexpensive, tasty and food selection.  They avoid the use of anything that's not natural, most everything is made fresh and it certainly is noticeable.  The menu is fairly large and portions are good size as well.  Two of my favorite items are the Beef Kafta rolled, which is season ground beef with herbs in a pita that is toasted and served with either tahini sauce or garlic sauce. (I prefer the garlic sauce)  You can also get the spicy kafta rolled which is the same thing but with Aladdin hot sauce, if you like spicy things I'd definitely recommend trying it, it has a nice natural kick no chemical hotness like you will find it some mass produced hot sauce.  The Chicken Chili is outstanding as well, some of the best chili I think I've had.  In general for the quality of food and selection I'd say that Aladdin's could very well be the best value I've discovered in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I never ever ever am disappointed. It's safe to say that I'm obsessed with the food here because I'm honestly here 1-3 times per month haha! I loved the food SO much in fact, that I catered my wedding with it! One of the first things everyone says when they reminisce about our wedding day is that the food was out of this world amazing! It was the best idea and the staff was so accommodating and courteous (as always!) my mom even had them cater the wedding shower too haha! We just can't get enough! :)"}
{"text":"Love their food. Staff is friendly and helpful. Lots of healthy options for vegetarians and vegans. Prices are reasonable. There is a lot of sodium in most dishes like most restaurants. The hummus and babaganosh are quite good. The falafel was moist."}
{"text":"Must try this place!! Their food is sooo good and they have SO many options to choose from. I'm not a fan of spicy food but their hot sauce is awesome. Their food is really healthy too.  Whenever I'm in town I order a ton of food to go and take it home with me. 
You know how some places the takeout isn't as good or distorts the food per sé compared to dining in? Carry out here is just as good and makes for great leftovers.
