{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food and 1/2 price pizzas on Wednesdays. Last year they had a customer appreciation day, everyone got a free drink ticket and they had plenty of food for everyone. They had an amazing variety of food from lasagna, pizza, eggplant rolls, salad and more all for free! Thanks Amicos for really appreciating your customers."}
{"text":"This small Pizza Restaurant in Parkdale is one of the favorites amongst my friends.  I have only had the pizza there and it is delicious.  It is served on a raised pizza serving tray and is cheesey and authentic.  In the summer the back patio is great. Be sure to check out the photos of the staff from 30 years ago!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend from work who has been raving about this place since I met her.  Its kind of a mom and pop sort of restaurant - the decor isn't going to blow you away.  The food however, is really good, and my God, is there ever a lot of it  I ordered the Chicken Parmigana and it comes with two sides.  I selected the pasta with meat sauce and the scalloped potatoes based on a reco from my friend (I wouldn't have ordered that on my own but was glad I did as it was great).  It was really good - nothing fancy, but totally solid good food.  The portions are huge - I barely finished half of it so look forwrad to finishing it tonight."}
{"text":"Ordered hungover pickup today. Got the panzerotti with cheese, clam linguine and caesar salad.   The panzerotti was exceptional if you love cheese, sauce and things that taste amazing.   The clam linguine was very fresh and full flavoured. The only bad thing is that I forgot I hate clams. I like mussels. Not clams. What a dummy. Must love clams!   The caesar salad was fresh and large. The sauce didnt have any garlic undertone to it so im a bit confused by it. It was kinda watery, not thick and rich.   Really great place with a casual and nice staff. Grab something and youll enjoy it :)"}
{"text":"This place may seem a little greasey spoon-ish but its because the food is awesome!!! They do delivery as well but the owner frank is why you actually wanna dine in. He comes out and makes you feel like youre at a big family get together.   Also... The booze... Great selection of bourbon.   Gotta try the pizza... Wed 1/2 price. So much better then the chains!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Amico's Ristorante many times during the past 5 years. We have never been disappointed on any of our visits both with the past owners and the new owners. The food is simply fantastic, very tasty, large portions. Pizza's here are one of the best in the City of Toronto. Staff is very knowledgeable and very friendly. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the owner's are always out to please. Drop in and experience great food at a great price. Best pizzeria in Parkdale.  Marvin & Lori"}
{"text":"Waited 2 HOURS for one medium pizza and was told \"sorry we were busy\". So I order a medium pizza and was told the wait would be 45-1 hour I was fine with that, then an hour and a half went by. Called to cancel after waiting 1 hour 45 minutes and was told that the delivery driver was on his way. I was then given a cold pizza . I am never ordering this place again and if you don't want to wait 2 hours for cold pizza you shouldn't either.   BTW its only about a 10 min drive from my place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem it is. We stumbled in here after a few drinks, walking along queen west. We checked out the back patio and decided to stay. At first we were not going to have pizza but we don't regret it. My Italian friends also rate this place a 4. That's a high rating for them because they know about real Italian pizza. The server was fun! She gave me her sweater to wear because I was cold! I liked the hipster vibe and the fact that they served restaurant food late! Felt very euro..plus the patio didn't shut down like other places!"}
{"text":"Ive ordered a few times.. pizza sucks consistently but the ggplant parm is usually on point unfortunately it came out raw this time. Hard eggplant not so yum. When i called as it was delivery the owner defended the food and made no attempt to correct it. Such as life."}
{"text":"Hands down, the dirtiest food joint in town. The order is wrong and late almost 100% of the time, and when it does arrive, its cold and soggy. What's worse is their horrible service wraps this whole mess of an operation together pretty well. You'd think they've given up"}
{"text":"I am no fan of pizzas so if I like a pizza place it must be reaaally good. That's what my friends say.  I've been living in this neighbourhood and noticing the cute delivery car parked outside the establishment for years but couldn't be bothered to step in. So glad I did on a cold day few weeks ago.   I ordered the Amico's deluxe pizza that comes with bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and tomato. The pizza was perfect and the ingredients blended in deliciously.  The restaurant has been around for a long time and it has an expanded section upstairs with pool table. Tables and chairs as well as bar-style seating in a pleasant ambient light makes it a great dinner spot. The owner(s) and staff are very pleasant, generous, and they even honoured an expired yelp discount coupon that appeared on my phone. Well done guys!  Amicos has become a recurring biweekly ritual now."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. It took like an hour and a half. The food was cold and the bread was black on the bottom.   Total waste of money and calories."}
{"text":"I live very close to Amico's, so it's been my go-to place for pizza for a while now - especially on Wednesday when their fantastic Italian style pizza is half price - but only recently did I eat-in and try something other than the pizzas and salads.  I was very impressed with the quality (and quantity) of the food. I ordered the pork tenderloin which came in a delicious sweet sauce.  The garlic bread that comes with each meal was great, and for my sides I had mixed veg. and scalloped potatoes.  The veggies were great - lightly steamed, nice big chunks and a good variety.  The scalloped potatoes... well, I called my mom the next day to tell her that I'd tried real scalloped potatoes for the first time.  They were so rich, so cheesy (not like the milky watery things my mom used to make) and overall just fantastic.  The entire meal left me feeling very full and very, very satisfied.  The server was great - though I think she may be temporary as the usual girl just had a baby - and the mix of people picking up pizza, eating in and just drinking at the bar made for a great, laid back atmosphere.    There's a reason Amico's has been around over 30 years!  Really a fantastic place."}
{"text":"Fun, down home good Italian cooling, nice happy staff, and a cool cook who seems to double as a comedian to boot. :-) The music mix was a fun throwback too. All good as a nice little neighborhood restaurant in Parkdale."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Zero stars was not an option. Just ordered it tonight as I got into town too late for room service. I had a chef salad, minestrone soup and honey garlic chicken wings. Too basic to mess up, and almost impossible for a non-picky, very hungry diner to pass up on. It was actually inedible. The lettuce was brown, and decorated only with green olives, tomatoes and some cheese. The wings were more fat than chicken and oddly chopped in half like a Chinese-style dish. The only good thing about the soup was that it was warm. Other than that, completely subpar. $25 to not eat dinner is cheaper than a personal training session."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, friendly place, frequented by nice locals. Horrific veal parma is like frozen shoe leather cooked in used motor oil. Hard to recommend but you might have some luck."}
{"text":"I love Amicos. The pizza is delicious, the booze flows till late, and it's almost always packed. Great place to end your night, my friends and I love coming here and will probably continue to come here for many moons to come!  We usually order the pizza but the calamari was a nice surprise. The portions are always a healthy amount and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I wish I could just give no stars...Honestly I really liked this place because it was cheap and open late but I'm lactose intolerant and I specifically ask for no cheese on everything I eat everywhere all the time everyday for my entire life and I asked for no cheese on my pasta and got home and it had cheese on it and I went back and the owner tried to say I didn't tell him no cheese.. and I told him he was wrong and he tried to justify his mistake by sayin I didn't say I didn't want cheese and basically argued with me over a mistak HE made with a paying customer that just walked 20 minutes to come get his food that got messed up .. acting like my 6 year old when I tell him he made a mistake and he tried to justify it by arguing with me saying I didn't say things I said wth my own mouth like dude shut up and don't argue with your customers and just except that you made a mistake . Typical male egotistical type .. can never be wrong  what a knob"}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot to go for a beer before a concert and was really surprised.  The staff was friendly and they had a really nice patio in the back.  Beer prices were very reasonable.   We ordered the wings and I would say they were a 5 out 10 since I believe they were frozen and probably precooked.    We then ordered a pizza since it was 1/2 price.  That made up for the lower quality wings.  This place could easily have been a 5 star if they would have cooked fresh and not precooked wings.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their pizza here is amazing! I've only had the cheese pizza but i'm telling you, there's something about this pizza that makes it soo flippin good! I'd definitely come here on a 1/2 price pizza Wednesday. The inside's pretty cool, they also have an outdoor back patio which is great for summer nights."}
{"text":"An old-school family pizzeria that also serves soups, pastas, salads, sandwiches and also meat & seafood entrees.  The food isn't fancy, but everything I have had from these guys has been well-prepared, the service is good and the prices are reasonable. (The veal sandwich is HUGE.)  This place also has a very wide delivery area so there is no reason for anybody to order from Pizza Hut again."}
{"text":"Have ordered for delivery or pick up many many times.  From the sammiches...I have had the chicken and veal...always good. You order what you want and get your marinara sauce on the side.  Their panzerotos are excellent!! Fantastic cheesy goodness. Deep fried or baked.  Salads are huge as well as their pasta dishes are a very large portion as well.   Inside is unfortunately kind of cheesy sports bar like with many Parkdale regulars.  This is why we take out. :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I had come Back from a trip and there was nothing else open, let alone delivering at 3:30am. Came to the door and it was still hot! The chicken parmigiana is a HUGE portion and the large pizza is also quite large. Everything we ordered was delicious. Forgot to bring the Caesar salad we ordered but I didn't even care that's how good it was. Now whenever I want pizza this is the only place I go!"}
{"text":"I have ordered 'za from here before and remember it being, just ok, but last night we wanted pasta and didn't feel like cooking.  I usually shy away from ordering take out pasta, because it's usually really really crappy and bland. So I was a little uneasy until I used my Yelp ap to check out what others have said.  Based on the reviews (and feedback from friends who have ordered there before) we decided to order the spaghetti and meatballs and the clam linguine.    Holy crap.  The clam linguine was awesome. I couldn't have made it better myself. It was SO delicious, lots of clamness in it, garlicy, fresh tomato... hot damn I was really impressed.  The spaghetti and meatballs (two big meatballs fyi) was good as well. I'm not a tomato sauce pasta fan, so I wouldn't ever order this, but my BF was having a craving so we ordered it.   Portions are HUGE. I have some of each leftover for lunch today. Took everything in me not to keep snacking on my clam pasta last night... I'm not sure how much I actually have left but that's how I know it's amazing. I want to keep eating it, even when it's cold.   I will absolutely order here again. I'm super impressed by the pasta, and I'll pay more attention to the 'za next time and update my review."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to try this local restaurant. The staff was welcoming and even the ambience of the place was inviting. We tried out the spaghetti and gnocchi in meat sauce (both). For appetizers, we had the Caesar salad and chicken wings.  The entrees is where it went wrong. My friend didn't like the sauce as much as I didn't like my gnocchi which tasted like small bits of dough with nothing in it but the surrounding sauce with barely any meat in the meat sauce. So I ended up leaving my half plate of gnocchi uneaten.  The pizza may be the thing to try since I did see families going for that particular dish. As a side note, the restaurant seems to have a good number of locals coming in by the dozen. So I will probably come for the pizza the next time... !!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was delightful! Just what I wanted from a Sunday evening. Friendly, calm, local: the whole place is like a small town restaurant.   I ordered a pizza: it was perfectly crisp. The sauce was light and flavourful. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I ordered an extra large and was delivered a medium. Instead of fixing the mistake, I was refunded the price to match that of a medium.  I received no apology or any sign of an admission of a mistake. Rather, I was told that they would do me a favor and charge me the lower amount because I was \"complaining\", despite the fact that I was given the wrong order.  I get that people make mistakes. I'd much more appreciate it if people admitted their mistake rather than blaming it on the customer.  The condescending tone on the phone was particularly frustrating."}
{"text":"Absolute waste of money. Ordered from here, pasta was flavourless to say the least and the bread that came with it must have been at least 5 weeks old. I could have used it as a jack stand for my truck. Called in to give my opinion of the level of food and they were disinterested."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a hundred places I've been. It's cheap and neighborhood-y and full of character and characters. Five stars for Wednesday half price pizza! It's real pizza, not assembled from frozen crap, and it's super cheap. They have good beer and music and a nice little patio. The service has always been fine. I would only give it four stars for other days of the week, as it's the wicked sweet Wednesday deal that puts it over the top for me. I honestly don't think it's worth it for the regular price, but I usually think that about pizza, so my judgement is apparently skewed."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Half-price Wednesdays are a must, holy crap what a deal. Their topping selection is out of this world. Will definitely return time and time again, thank you Amico's."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because Frank seemed nice...but unfortunately I cannot rate the pizza. I wish I could - I arranged for delivery at a birthday party and my pizza didn't show up stranding 25 drunk people with nothing to eat. Frank! What happened??"}
{"text":"THANK YOU for being open late! We always find ourselves hungry when we're up so late and thankfully Amico's is open til 4am!! Their pizza is always delish!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Came in with just the strongest urge for spaghetti and it hit the spot! Super generous portion. Garlic toast included. Delicious cheesecake. They knew my name cause I called ahead and didn't hesitate to call me by it the whole time. The owners were in and went out of their way to make the environment comfortable - so pleasant :). The dishes were simple, but that was exactly what I was looking for.  I'll be back to try the pizza! I've heard great things. And I see they've got an order ahead app now on their website so I'll give it a try :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was horrible. There was no cheese on it and it was overcooked. I also ordered tiramisu and I couldn't even eat it because it looked so bad and old.  So disappointing. Worst pizza ever."}
{"text":"Cute place sure.. but DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT come here on WEDNESDAYS,  it may be half price for they pizzas but their service freaking sucked. I arrived here with 4 other people about 6pm on Wednesday, the place was so packed that a server offered us to go upstairs - to which we went and had the whole top bar to ourself.... interesting. Anyhow - we decided to go back downstairs when my mom noticed a free table which the server had not told us about. So we took the chance to grab it and proceeded to tell our waitress that we had moved. Mind you this was about 10 minutes after already waiting. Upon telling our waitress that we moved tables, she looked at my mom and said \"OH... YEA, what did you order again?\" as if she forgot all about us.. and she DID by the confused look on her face.  With the place as crowded as it was, we were understanding and then ordered our 2 medium pizzas and only chose from the regular topping menu. Not that complicated, right? p.s we ordered 1 round of drinks while we waited.  Half an hour passed and my mom decided ask our server how long it would take. It seemed like our waitress was taking more phone calls and take out orders than worrying about the actual inside of the restaurant.  She said she would check the back, but she never got back to us. Another half an hour later passed... we all went out for a smoke. We all got more drinks - because of this long wait, there really wasn't anything else to do.  An hour an a half later (LITERALLY), my mom once again politely explains that we've been waiting for too long for such a small order. The people sitting behind us who clearly came after us had already gotten their pizza way before us. The server then explains that there was a mixup in the order and we would have to wait 20 more minutes... This wasn't even her coming up to let us know. This was my mom having to ask her what the fuck was taking so long.   Suchhh bad service and way too polite of a family - this place has no consideration. We told them to forget it, and that we were leaving. We only paid for our 1 round of drinks, because frankly, they owed us for our time wasted. We then left -  STILL STARVING, PIZZALESS, AND SUPER ANGRY.  Very disappointing... I must say. Ordering from Dominos would have been quicker, sadly."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The delivery was over an hour later than they said they would be. The food was cold. The wings tasted like they came from the freezer section of a gas station. Only redeeming quality was the calamari-- those were good, even cold. My hotel recommended this place and I will be suggesting they not do so in the future."}
{"text":"What a disappointment the food is here! The first time I ordered from Amicos, I ordered pasta. It took about over an hour to receive the delivery, even though I just live up the street. The pasta was bland and tasted like canned pasta you would eat at the supermarket. Plus the pasta itself was hard as a rock. Then on another occasion, I had been pretty hungry late at night, and seeing that nothing else was really open that I liked, I decided to order the pizza this time from Amicos. Again a disappointment! The pizza tasted bland, and the ingredients didn't taste fresh. Also there was such a minimal amount of toppings on the pizza, I felt I was just eating bread with tomato sauce and tiny bit of cheese. Complete waste of money and calories. I remember ordering from this place like 25 years ago, as they have been open since about 1978 I believe, and the pizza then was amazing. What happened? I will NEVER order from Amicos again."}
{"text":"Quick and easy delivery. The pizza was delicious. I like that they send an email when you order online to tell you when they are leaving to bring you the pizza. Helps build the anticipation! Can't wait to order again!"}
