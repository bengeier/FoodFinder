{"text":"The service was amazing the staff exquisite. Food splendid  as I ate my food I had a moment of clarity and acceptance a realization that greatness resides here at grabbagreen."}
{"text":"I am a vegan and learned of this place just a few weeks ago and I've been there several times since. This is a great place to eat if you are a vegan or if you just want to eat clean!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies but employees are always on there phone. Management reached out to me in regards to the cell use and will be fixing it. Updating review to 4 star based on amazing smoothies and amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Love this spot! I have been quite a few times since I found it a couple weeks ago and have tried several menu items, including various grain bowls and salads. All have been filling, fresh and tasty. Love the concept behind this restaurant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I walked in 10 mins before they closed and the gentleman told me they were closed. I told him the signed said 8p so he said, well your order will be limited and made me feel like it was an inconvenience that I was there.... I will never come back..."}
{"text":"I had my second visit to Grabbagreen yesterday. Both times I've been I've gotten smoothies, that were both excellent. They were so good that I'm actually waiting on my husband to go get grain bowls and juice for lunch! I'm sure they will be as delicious as the smoothies. I didn't even realize how extensive the menu was until my second trip. Definitely take a look at the menu, Grabbagreen has more than meets the eye available!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the menu and decided to splurge and order delivery because it looked so good (and I didn't have a car). I ordered the Moroccan Mac & Cheese for $11 which turned into $17 after tax, delivery and tip. 

The lady that delivered it was on the phone and literally just shoved a bag through the door and didn't say anything. Ok weird but the foods what matters right? I open the bag to find what looks like a kids size Togo box, and I immediately think this is what $17 will get you? So I open it thinking maybe it's packed in the very densely, nope! It's half full! ( see picture) 

The mac and cheese itself was sooooo mushy. It almost tasted like mashed potatoes not noodles. I ended up only eating 1/3 of it because it was nothing like mac and cheese. It had a strange sweet taste to it as well. I would definitely not order again and not recommend to anyone to use deliver from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  I am vegan and they were great about making substitutions for me.  The grain bowl
Was delicious, but it was a little expensive at $10 for the portion. The sauces were also excellent.  My daughter had one of the juices and it was also very good.  I will be back. Nice to have an exclusively gluten free menu as well!   Recommend!"}
{"text":"5 stars because of the following. 
They delivered a great tasting entree the grabba grain french quarter was as explained with plenty of shrimp.  The extremely high quality meal was brought to me in about 5 min or less. 

For $10.00 you absolutely can't touch the quality and speed this meal was produced.  

Thanks guys for offering a healthy solution to my area."}
{"text":"From the mouth of a true meat-a-tarian, this place is a great healthy alternative for the normal burger and fries joints. The food is excellent (no really!) and the service is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"I want to give GrabbaGreen 5 stars just on the quality of the food however I am disappointed in the protein portions.  The last two meals I've ordered I have asked for extra shrimp and/or extra salmon which is an extra $3.00.  So my meal goes from 10.00 to 13.00--which is totally fine.  The problem is the \"extra portion\" doesn't look like much.  I ordered extra salmon this past week on a Build your own, and honestly the portion size was the equivalent of 3 bites of salmon (I would have asked but it was take out and I didn't notice until I got all the way home). So either they didn't add the extra amount of protein I paid for, or they've cut back on their portion sizes.  As far as the quality of the food, its very good so no complaints there and the folks who work there are always very friendly.  However there is another restaurant around the corner from me that makes a fantastic salad with a full size salmon piece for about the same price. Come on GrabbaGreen, I really want to love your place but if your customers are going to pay extra money for additional protein, then you need to make sure they get it."}
{"text":"I ate at Grabbagreen today. The food was delicious and very healthy. The staff was helpful with the menu choices. I had the Veggie Collard Wrap and the I am Luscious smoothie. Both were great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a quick lunch here today based off a recommendation. We thoroughly enjoyed our grain bowls and we felt good and satisfied after eating. Will definitely be back!  Nice concept."}
{"text":"Gluten free- Yes
Casein free- Yes, just don't add cheese to you meal

Grabbagreen is a completely new franchise to me. That being said, if your big selling point is clean food that is 100% GMO free and 100% Gluten Free, I'm sold. 

This is place is a dedicated GF business, so Celiacs should have no issues or fears about dinning here. The menu is pretty straight forward, as they have a selection of grain boxes, smoothies, and breakfast wraps combinations listed. If none of the combos meets what your looking for, you can make your own by choosing from a variety of options.

Additional Highlights :

+  Brand new space with a bright modern industrial design

+ Fresh quality ingredients that provide a healthy and filling meal

+ Fast and friendly service

+ Reasonable prices that won't break the bank"}
{"text":"First time patron and probably my last. Stopped in for a smoothie..I usually go to Earth Fare or Clean Juice but wanted to give it a chance to be added into rotation but I was completely disappointed.  It was after the lunch crowd so I expected I wouldn't have too long of a wait.  After for the cashier finally got off the phone, I placed an order for a Power PB&J.  The cashier went to the back a brought out a container of strawberries and proceeded to twist the tops and put them in the blender.  I asked if they had had been washed and his response was \"oh let me get that\".  What? Was he going to use unclean fruit and make my smoothie? The menu indicates a choice of almond or peanut butter; I selected almond butter.  Please tell me why a scoop of almonds were used? Nevertheless this is the  grittiness smoothie ever :(.   A waste of $7 and about 15 minutes!!"}
{"text":"This place is fairly new. I never even noticed the place but I did get a coupon in the mail and me and my husband decided to try it. The place is clean and pretty. Service was really good and friendly but slightly slow. It was a tad confusing but I guess because we've never been before we weren't sure how the concept was. 

We each did the create your own. I had spinach with shrimp and some toppings on it. The salad was huge. I asked for extra avocado sauce and only got one small container. I asked for more and they gave me some and said they are completely out of it so they couldn't give me two full containers. Surprising since we were there around 1145 am. My husband got the quinoa with chicken and some toppings. He did not like the chicken. It was dry and flavorless. 

Overall, the place is nice and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ballantyne is really lacking in a decent salad place so I was really trying to like this place but it's really too overpriced for what they give you. The toppings are very weak. Basically it would serve as a side salad."}
