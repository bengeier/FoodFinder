{"text":"Use to love this place. Walked in today and people working were so rude, won't go back. Wanted to buy quite a few things, but they literally acted like we were bothering them. No one was in the store but my husband and I. So wasn't busy."}
{"text":"In town for a conference needing a quick lunch. Instead I stopped by this place- a wonderful slow browse through a wonderland of cheese and sandwiches and such. Plenty of samples and an option to sample cheese with a paired wine for very little money while I was browsing.   Left with a great turkey sandwich, chips and lemonade. Only able to eat half the sandwich as it was well stuffed. Prices are higher than the Subway up the street but $11.00 gets you great and healthy food with amazing cheese, a drink, chips, and a bit of dark chocolate. I will return later in the conference."}
{"text":"As with most artisanal cheese shops I've been to, Fromagination is like a happy rustic wonderland. Major points for the rotating (random) assortment of \"small pieces,\" (\"orphans,\" as another reviewer pointed out) which are basically just the broken-off chunks from larger slices, priced at around a few bucks each.   The selection from local dairies is great (especially for tourists like me!) but despite the basically friendly service, I did feel a hint of annoyance from the cheesemongers when I asked my fifth or sixth question. Fromagination is clearly a popular destination for out-of-towners looking for the \"local experience,\" but the high volume foot-traffic seems to take its toll on the service. I have high expectations for artisanal shops -- Isn't personalized service a rudimentary characteristic of such places? --   but it's possible I expect too much. Or it's possible I just visited on an \"off\" day.   Regardless, I felt like I received a nice introduction to some of Wisconsin's prized cheeses, and loved the additional selection of carby accompaniments. Please, Lord, have Whole Foods carry Potter's Crackers at some point in the near future?"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese selection! Sample any cheese you want to or if you don't know what you want, ask the friendly, knowledgable staff for help.   After getting that kid in the candy store feeling upon walking in, my wife and I could not decide which cheese to buy. We wanted them all, but being from out of town we thought it best to just get one to have with a tasty New Glarus brew before bed. We asked for help and they did not disappoint. We were asked what flavors we liked and the staff found us just the right cheese.  They also sell excellent meats that are made locally, and lots of tasty options for pairing. From beer to wine to chocolate to fruit to crackers to jams, they have a great selection of quality foods."}
{"text":"It's not cheap - tough to get out of here without losing $12 for a sammich, drink, and bag 'o chips - but I've been back time after time due to the quality, the view, the bonus samples, and the great service.  DELICIOUS cheese shop making its own French style cheeses in the back - and selling a wide variety of treats in the deli cases."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, it isn't just cheese!   When I think about a store dedicated to cheese, I think about only going in a place like that for holiday gifts, not every day shopping.  BUT! This store has so much more than just cheese (although their cheese selection is amazing).  They have wine, and chocolates, and they also serve food.  They have wonderful sandwiches and salads that you must try.    Most importantly, they sell macaroons.  MACAROONS. I am always in search of delicious, sweet, colorful macaroons and I am left empty handed most times.  Fromagination has filled this void in my life by selling boxes of these treats in various flavors.  They are near the back of the store, in the cooler next to the sales counter.    I know I sound so silly raving about sweets in a primarily savory shop, but I am not ashamed of my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The lunch stuff is excellent and they have it ready for walk-in, so it's surprisingly quick to grab something. Staff is very competent and nice, overall. There's a one person I've noticed working there who gets stressed out and hovers over people, telling them they're going to break something in the store. Wish she'd relax."}
{"text":"Great selection of cheeses, but what really gives this place 5 stars is the customer service.  The staff are extremely attentive, friendly, resourceful, and generous on the samples!  They also do some great assortments or gift baskets for someone looking to buy a gift or bring a beautiful platter to a party.  In addition to cheese, they also have some great chocolates (i do love Gail Ambrosius chocolates which are sold here) and other packaged items.  If you're feeling lazy and don't feel like making your own, buy their crostinis---soooo good!"}
{"text":"Rating my cheese knowledge/snobbery on a scale of  1 to 10, I'm about a 4, yet the staff at Fromagination set me at ease. Krista and Priscilla were working when we set foot inside the small shop, overflowing with cheese (and honey), overwhelmed by the abundance of cheeses. Krista quickly took us on a fromage journey in our attempt to assemble a delightful gift basket for our parents.   All the cheese can be tasted, and we did our best to try them all. The shop also has crackers, syrups, jams, dried fruits, wines, and old-styled maps. It was a great way to spend an hour or two, although if you love cheese, be prepared to spend a bit - as you can imagine, many of the cheeses are a pretty penny and then some."}
{"text":"Wow. This has to be the best cheese store in Madison... and maybe even the country. The cheese selection is just ridiculous and there is always a huge variety of samples out around the store. I dare anyone to walk out without buying something - the cheeses are just TOO good. I also once came here to buy some gifts to send to family and friends back home - they have great locally made peanut butter, jams, and honey that shouldn't be overlooked. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and kind, so if you're overwhelmed by the selection don't hesitate to ask for recommendations - they are very helpful!"}
{"text":"Great shop to find anything cheese, meat and chocolate. Awesome selection that will have your mouth watering and your wallet crying.   The great thing about this place is the service. I went in a foodie and left with a degree in cheese."}
{"text":"A great place to take people from out of town. Excellent selection of artisan cheeses. A bit pricey, but worth it. Giselle always has excellent wine recommendations."}
{"text":"Tasty cheese and specialty items.  The turkey sandwich is one of the best i have had.  Only downfall is the higher prices  but still worth it."}
{"text":"God, I love cheese.  This place is really amazing.  What a great selection of local and not-so-local artisanal cheeses.  My favorite part is that they have small samples of each wrapped up, so you can do your own taste test.  I don't live in Madison, so I haven't been able to take advantage of the tastings or meals they host, but I would love to do that on a future trip."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pasture Harvest sandwich and for nearly $10 with tax it was definitely a disappointment. Don't know why I thought it was a good idea to drop $10 on food that is pre-made. The cheese wasn't outstanding, the \"rustic roll\" was stale bread, the \"house-made maple mayonnaise\" tasted like just regular Hellmann's or Miracle Whip. I've had better sandwiches at Panera bread."}
{"text":"This place is so great.  Just know, they close at 5 on Saturday so if you're going to stop in, stop in before that!!    I found this place from a food tour described on Trip Adviser.  We decided to add it to the tour we were making up on our visit to Madison.  We really weren't quite sure what to expect (and I'll admit, predicted it would only be a 5 minute stop where we would try to get some free samples) and were pleasantly surprised.  We walked around aimlessly and then easily got into conversation with the staff.  They were extremely friendly in explaining the cheeses to us.    We were starting to feel bad that we couldn't purchase anything because weren't sure what to do with any cheeses we purchased since we had no plans on going home anytime soon.  Imagine our delight when we found out we could buy cheese, crackers, and wine and enjoy them all right there at the tables outside the store!!  They even provided us with wine glasses and opened up the wine for us.    After consuming a large pack of crackers, one bottle of wine, and almost a pound of cheese between 3 people we were extremely full and very happy.  Plus, as a Madison tourist, I loved hanging out right on the square.  I don't necessarily recommend consuming as much cheese as we did but I do recommend the experience of stopping in at Fromagination!"}
{"text":"Cheese and \"perfect companions\" are... well... perfect. There's a lot to love about this shop and the up-scale items it sells. However, the staff members are as rude as they are knowledgeable. I've had enough bad customer service experiences now to say unequivically that it's not just that an employee was having an off day (which can happen to anyone). I've been ignored, condescended to, and flat out told that staff were too busy to help me. Too busy to help a paying customer? As much as it pains me to say (because I really, really want to love this place), I guess I'll make your job easier and take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"They don't just sell cheese! Fromagination is one of the best places to grab a sandwich on the square. In the summer they also have a great outdoor seating area which overlooks the capital square.   Fromagination doesn't stop at cheese and sandwiches, it also has a large selection of condiments to go with every variety of cheese. The helpful (and attractive) staff will give you great information about every product in the store and make sure you can create the dish you have in your mind."}
{"text":"We love cheese, so we decided to give Fromagination another try... I am so glad we did!  Our experience this time was completely different than our first one.  The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant - in spite of that fact that the place was packed.  They have a great selection of cheeses from outside of WI."}
{"text":"Cute little chessy place :) get there ice cream that is crazy expensive."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for foodie gifts and gourmet cheeses for party plates. It's a bit pricey, but they're not exactly peddling Kraft Singles. Browsing is fun, they have a great selection of sauces and mustards and oils. Sometimes when I go in they're conducting a tour or presentation, which sucks if you're shopping because the store is small and you have to push through slack-jawed tourists. It really puts a sour note on the experience when you have to maneuver your way through a crowd of fatties grabbing at free cheese. The staff is knowledgeable, but it's hit or miss whether you'll be treated well. Some staff are all smiles and free samples and some look at you like you ate a pound of broccoli and came to their store just to fart. The sandwiches are great, you can just grab one and eat on the capitol lawn. All in all, a great store!"}
{"text":"Ok I have been reading some of the comments here regarding rude service.  It seems to me that issue must have been addressed at some point because my wife and I recently visited this shoppe and were treated with nothing but cheer and respect.  We sampled at least 6 or more cheeses, some we liked and a couple not so much.  Top Notch experience. We even got a little thank you note that we didn't notice she had prepared for us when we got to the bottom of our package.  Like or Love cheese? VISIT THIS PLACE. . if you are curious about cheese? Visit this place as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food at Fromagination.  This store has bailed me out of more than one dinner party.  There is an exceptional variety of everything.  And, even better, the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable about pairings and has solid suggestions for any occasion.  It is also the perfect stop after a Farmers Market trip on Saturday to round of the purchases with good cheese.  The store has a crazy-funky cheese smell, but it is clean, attractive, and well-lit.  Like the Old Fashioned, it is a great stop when hosting out of towners.  That being said, your personal experience will vary WIDELY with each visit.  The staff has a rather schizophrenic approach to customer service.   Some are extraordinarily helpful and approach the shop like a welcoming culinary experience.    However, some of the staff approach the shop like it is the cheese version of Louis Vuitton.  Cold, condescending, and borderline rude.  Before I walk in I always have the brief internal debate about whether it is worth the gamble that day.    Suggested tip: Never ever try to use a Groupon here.  Just pay full price.  You'll be so much happier with your experience."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased, but this is one of my favorite shopping and culinary spots in Madison. It's not the typical Wisconsin cheese store (cheddar, cheddar, cheddar), it's much, much more than that. They take extreme care in picking cheeses that are handcrafted, delicious, and local--and the way it's presented (through showcasing the cheese, sampling, and customer service), just reinforces that. I've tasted some amazing cheeses here, and the ambiance is great. I feel as though I've stepped into a small European store when I walk in. A cheese class is a definite must--I've taken classes that range from Cheese 101 to Mixed Milk and Fruity Beers to Stinky Cheese and Funky Beer--and they were all great fun and really informative. I love that they don't just focus on cheese...they make it a whole experience with the right accoutrement. Love, love, love Fromagination. This place is a definite must if you're a foodie of any sort."}
{"text":"Nice boutique cheese shop. Christie was extremely helpful and we sampled plenty as we added to our order. A must visit every time we come to Madison!"}
{"text":"Oh my sammich.   We'd heard of this place, and made a specific point of having lunch here during our weekend in Madison. It exceeded expectations (and they were high).   Just walking past the counter of cheeses to order a sandwich was inspiring. I was initially a little disappointed when the cashier turned and grabbed the pre-made sandwiches off the shelf, but it didn't last long. We lingered in the shop for a little, and then went outside to eat. (There's no where to eat in the store.)  And then I died and went to sandwich heaven.    I got a Specialty and my husband got The Best of the Midwest. The Brie and cranberry on mine was awesome. The sunflower seeds on the thick, crisp bread were a nice touch. Husband's sandwich managed to contain a dozen flavored and you could taste them all.   It was a deeply satisfying experience for any meal, much more so for a sandwich. I don't know if I can ever eat another sandwich again."}
{"text":"Stopped by and got a few cheeses and sandwiches. Picked up a black truffle brie (a friend who adores french cheeses from his time there absolutely devoured it), some l'exquis d'rgental (a double cream french cheese) that was similar to a salty creamy butter with a cheesy overtone - completely spreadable on my crunchy rolls (delicious), and a mapley/nutty fenugreek gouda from wisconsin (went very well with slices of apple and cured meats and bread).  The cheese selection is quite good and I only could try a small morsel of what they offer.  As well I ordered a signature turkey sandwich with cranberry relish and the roasted chicken with its flavorful smoky chipotle spread. The knock on these were that they are served cold and the chicken wasn't that great (overcooked). Half of the sandwich was saved for home and heated in the oven producing a gooey chicken/cheese sandwich that was much better. If Fromagination would serve these sandwiches warm I could see topping by for another sometime but I wouldn't eat them cold again.  I'll be back come summer time to sit outside and have a cheese sampler."}
{"text":"The cheese is good and ive liked the enviroment here in the past it was fun. I was hoping for a fun time again for my anniversary but this last visit was dissapointing. The customer service was pretty bad. One guy handed us cheese samples with his fingers which was off putting but he was nice. The other was very curt and pompous (his/her name starts with a J). Since when does knowing about fermented animal secretions make you better than others? Either he has nothing going on aside from this or hes grumpy from an aged cheddar that got lost in the wrong orafice. We get it liberal arts is hard but you dont have to take out your AP basket weaving frustrations on the world.  It seemed as though me wishing to sample before i spend $50+ on a brick of cheese was an burden on the employees. If im dropping money on a food product that no one really needs one would think the service would be the selling point. Honestly, ill probably come back here again to hamster the cheese in my cheeks then buy it online for less."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to visiting this shop on our trip up from Chicago.  Came in at 4:20 on a Thursday and was pretty much told to go away when asked if I could order a cheese tray to eat there.  I left and went to Graze to order a cheese tray.  So much for a good cheese shop.  I was planning on picking up a few cheeses tomorrow on my way out of town but will try a different market.  Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"By far the best place for buying amazing cheese in Madison. The selection of cheese is wide, and the employees are all well trained and helpful. Samples are also an added bonus. If you need to get cheese for a special occasion this is the place. Also for lunch their sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Fromagination. Last time I was there I went with my mom to get a cheese baguette for lunch. My mom asked if she could have a baguette with Gruyere cheese on it and a little dijon mustard rather than buying one of the premade baguette sandwiches they keep in their fridge. The employee helping us was very friendly and told her that wouldn't be a problem. However, when he asked his boss about creating a cheese baguette for my mom he was visibly upset. We were pretty surprised about that. My mom's sandwich would cost more money than one of the premade sandwiches and he was upset about a customer willing to pay more? Seeing the manager be so unfriendly about a simple request made me think differently about this place. I did order a premade sandwich for myselft, it was good but cold from the fridge.I like the cornichons they give you to accompany the baguettes."}
{"text":"A really amazing place.  They were fantastic at helping me pick out cheeses for a wine and cheese party.  Lots of sampling, knowledge, and helpfulness!  I keep going back there for a tub of Fantome Farm's creamy goat cheese, which sometimes sells out before I get to the farmer's market.  So I go to Fromagination and get my fix!  Plus, I had wealthy relatives from France who came to visit, and happened upon Fromagination while out walking.  They said it was as good as any cheese they had tasted in France!  Recommendations don't get much better than that."}
{"text":"While living in Madison I've always had excellent service when shopping or simply perusing the cases at Formagination. It can often be busy, but the staff tends to be attentive as they can be even during a Farmers Market rush.   However, I'm not writing today to review the in-store service. I recently wanted to send a shipment of Wisconsin cheese home to Connecticut. I made the order online on December 17 - one day before the cut off day guarantee for a Christmas delivery. Christmas came and went and my family in Connecticut hadn't received the shipment. New Year's came and went and the box still hadn't arrived.  I called the store on January 3 and explained to Ken the situation. As soon as out the problem he told me he'd get back to me in half an hour. 10 minutes later he'd called me back apologizing profusely about the mix-up and promptly sent the original shipment out plus additional items from the store.   I understand mistakes happen and not every single order can be perfect. I greatly appreciate it when a store goes above and beyond to make up for an error."}
{"text":"Good selection of local and not-so-local cheeses, wickedly expensive, though. I bought a few cheeses for a party recently, just enough to serve about 6 people, could not believe how much it cost. Although I enjoyed the cheeses themselves, many of them are available at Metcalfe's for considerably less."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little shop that has so much more than cheese.  In fact, I have probably bought more non-cheese product here than actual cheese.    The shop is pretty small and tightly packed, but it has a lot to offer for cheese and otherwise.  Aside from the amazing selection of cheese they also stock many different varieties of fruit preserves, honey, oils, chocolates, and more.  It is a great spot to pick up locally produced food gifts.  On my most recent trip I discovered the cheese \"orphans\" which are small chunks of cheese that are left over.  I've seen this at other places and am glad to see it here, too!  This is a great way to try new (pricey) cheeses without having to pay a premium."}
{"text":"My mother is well acquainted with my passion for sandwiches, so on my last visit to Madison she took me to Fromagination.   We shared 2 sandwiches: the roast beef and maple turkey. WOW. They were SO GOOD. The roast beef was very hearty and flavorful on a rustic bread.   The turkey sandwich was a delicate dessert of a sandwich, with slices of apple and . . . MAPLE MAYONNAISE."}
{"text":"Staff is super helpful, knowledgeable, and will let you try any cheese. Give the orphans a home! They're a perfect snack sized option or can be sliced and added to any sandwich!"}
{"text":"If this place didn't already have enough going for it you can now buy Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream here.  It's the only place in Madison that carries it.  Iit might even be the only place outside of Ohio.  I do not exaggerate when I say that Jeni's is the very best ice cream you will ever have.  Add in the variety of cheese, the knowledgeable staff & all of the other goods you can find here and you have one of the top 5 Madison establishments.  EDIT: I was mistaken and while Fromagination is indeed the only place in Madison that carries Jeni's there are tons of fine stores carrying their ice cream elsewhere in the U.S.  http://tiny.cc/gt1wo"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful selection of cheeses and meats. A very knowledgable staff and willing to give suggestions. Fromagination has broadened my cheese horizons.  They also have a fantastic set of crackers and things to go with cheese. This is a must stop on Wednesday nights for Concert on the Square."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a foodie. Yes, I was reared in the pastoral Driftless Zone, home to some of the best dairy in Dairyland. Yes, I am quite fond of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream (which, in Madison, is carried here and only here).  However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude.   I stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it's not as extensive as I'd expect--despite Fromagination's artful arranging I'd venture a guess that Whole Foods' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can't handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn't quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \"Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \"Ma'am, I'm having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.  But I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.\" Clearly embarrassed, he turned and walked out.    That's the most extreme example I've witnessed (though on separate occasions I've heard people say \"I have money to spend here...\" as they stood, stymied by the lack of attention) but it exemplifies the general vibe pretty well.  With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I'm there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I'm merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they'll steer me away from it! \"This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that's what you want?\" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.  Thanks!    I will keep going to Fromagination, especially because the shop takes great pains to promote local/regional cheese makers, but I hope they consider the constructive criticism and perhaps start having fun with the idea of selling cheese."}
{"text":"Yum! Great sandwiches, nice drink selection and friendly staff. They threw a couple of Godiva chocolate squares into the to-go bag both times we got sandwiches, which was a really nice and thoughtful surprise. Good prices, great quality bread and top notch ingredients. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I was really expecting to have an amazing experience here.  I was excited at the potential.   I'm sad that I can't rave and give this place 5 stars.   My husband went to Fromagination to pick up sandwiches for our family (4 of us) to bring back to our hotel to eat.  He waited 20 min for our sandwiches to be made, just to wait an additional 10min as someone else took one of our 4 sandwiches.  (Not Fromagination's fault). When he got back to the hotel he handed out the sandwiches that everyone ordered.  1 Best of the Midwest- my daughter loved it and thought it was absolutely delicious.  1 Chile Ancho Chicken- solid.  Perfect for WI palates because there was barely any heat with this sandwich.  We expected a little more \"zip\" but it was still good.  1 Val D'Aran Beef- my teenage son said it was one of the best sandwiches he has ever had in his life (and for the record, he's eaten some really good food...not cooked by me.) Finally- The Great WI!!!!!   Oh wait.  No.  We didn't get the Great WI that we ordered and paid a whopping $15 for!  Rather, we got a second Val D'Aran Beef.  Not super when only one of the 4 of us eats roast beef.   If we were at Fromagination, we would have dealt with yet another long wait and had them fix our order.  Unfortunately, we were back at our hotel and we shouldn't have had to unwrap all 4 sandwiches in a packed place of business to ensure they got our order right.   I'm definitely irritated that we overpaid significantly.   Was the food good?  Yes.  Was the experience good?  Not so much.   It takes a combination of food and experience to make us return to restaurants and when we do, we are LOYAL.  Will we return to Fromagination?  Maybe."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!!! The selection was mind boggling and thr warmth and hospitality was truly remarkable thanks to Rachel!! We walked away with almost 200$ in cheese And sooo much more! Definitely a place to visit again before i leave the midwest!"}
{"text":"6:02 pm.. . tugging on the door handle only to realize that they close at 6pm! Lesson learned and I came back extra early the next day.  My co-worker suggested that I come here for some goodies to bring home since this will probably be a rare occasion that I am in Wisconsin. Everyone says this is THE place to go for good Wisconsin cheese and cheeses that you can't find back at home.  I ended up buying $20 of cheese that spoiled before I got home.  This was all my fault though. Nick (cutie at the counter) warned me that I should refrigerate the cheese.  Being the Asian that I am .. I figured that that it's like milk...you can keep it 3 days after the \"suggested\" date.  .  . .  Pro: Drunken Goat Cheese A million varieties of cheese Gourmet top rated sandwiches Walking distance from the Capitol and Downtown  Cons: Still pretty pricey for cheese  Cheese curds are not as great as ppl make them sound."}
{"text":"A Rare Gem!  I spent many lovey evenings in Madison with a cheese, cracker, and chutney platter accompanied by a glass of wine - all purchased at this lovely shop.  Stayed at the hotel next door for a few weeks, and rarely missed a day here.  Yes, the cheese selection is to die for, and the folks behind the counter are knowledgeable, and ever-willing to offer a suggestion or a sample.   The heavily-truffled cheddar, paired with a cranberry chutney and served with a lightly-sweet white wine was just too delicious for words.   The ready-to-go sandwiches are great for a quick lunch.  The wine selection is not large, but is nicely curated to offer reasonable selections appropriate to the many cheese types on hand.   Don't miss the chocolates or other available treats. I'm jealous, Madison. Quite jealous."}
{"text":"I really love this shop ! There are a lot of great cheese and chocolate, and many good brands like Dean and Deluca, Jenis Icecream !  I'm surely, I'll come back again"}
{"text":"Place is really expensive. Guess that's the first I want to say especially considering there are a ton of cheese shops everywhere in WI. It's small and really chic, almost hipster-ist. There are some samples and I understand you can try any of the cheeses but I didn't. Just tried some of the samples and liked what I had. Again, the prices are pretty high which I didn't receive all too well but the cheeses are really good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! So many great things to check out. They have plenty of cheeses of course but also sandwhiches, drinks, ice cream, meat products, sauces, seasonings, sweets, crackers, the list goes on! Check this out if you want something special for yourself or if tou are looking for a gift for the foodie in your life."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this cheese shop while visiting from out of town. We wanted to do a tasting of various cheeses and figured this would be the place to go. When I asked about doing a tasting the guy acted confused and was very unfriendly. It's a cheese shop so I figured they would have an option where you could pick several cheeses to taste for a price. After giving up on the tasting idea we thought we'd still grab a sandwich since we read that they make sandwiches. All the sandwiches were pre-made and sitting in a cooler. Not too appetizing so we left without purchasing anything... I still give it two stars because they had a nice assortment of cheeses and the shop was cute. Customer service here is awful. The lady at the counter was rude too. Our time in Madison was short so it wasn't worth us wasting time in a place like this."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best cheese shop I have EVER been to! The staff is super knowledgable and friendly but it's their products that are insanely good!"}
{"text":"It's quite pricey (hence the bump down to 4 stars) but they really have an amazing selection of cheese including artisanal producers from Wisconsin as opposed to the mass produced, vacuum sealed, somewhat generic stuff you see at most cheese shops across the state.  In addition to cheese, they have a lot of really good accompaniments as well as a sandwich selection that is a great option for lunch - just order your sandwich and then eat outside at their tables overlooking the square.  Great place, worth stopping if you're in or near Madison."}
{"text":"Best place in Madison to buy cheese. They have a very large selection to choose from so no matter what you are looking for I'm sure you will find it here. Another nice thing is the bit size pieces to try. Or if there is something not already cut up just ask and they will give you a sample. Lot's of gourmet oils, vinegars and spices as well and the potter's crackers are wonderful!! It is pricey but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"2 stars for a decent selection, though for a premium surpassing Whole Foods, who compete to a lesser, but not far lesser, extent when it comes to selection.    Wish I could give more stars.  Afraid the same stodgy air characterizes this place, as surrounds far too many wine vendors and gatherings.  There is an oppressive stuffiness that is a general stance, whenever I come in to the store; owner and staff are aloof and haughty, and where knowledge is lacking, can pretend to more than actually exists.  Preciousness that is completely alien to what these wonderful products actually give to us.  It's food, people.  It should be shared with love, with affective, sensual joy.  These products are made by farmers and craftspeople who sweat and get dirty.  For more than many of them, artisans whose palates have been honed over years of dutiful labor; they stand with the very best.  And who may actually look more like, well, farmers and cheesemakers, than would-be Ultras.  In a word, from my perspective, Fromagination should long ago have gotten over itself."}
{"text":"Quice and Apple shallot confit. Just thinking of it makes me dissolve in a heap of happy.   They make one hell of a sandwich.  They use several Nueske's meats - which are always fabulous - though the salami they've sourced for sandwiches is also exceptional.     Plus: scads of exceptional Wisconsin cheese options and knowledgeable, helpful staff.  Other boutique-y food stuffs available - things like honeys, dressings, sauces, oils, seasonings, and chocs.  Wasn't able to visit during the winter, so I can't speak to the yumminess of their soups - I do look forward to checking them out this fall, though."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to get some locally made gifts for friends and family? Are you looking to get cheeses, beers, cured meats, chocolates, gourmet condiments and sauces? Look no further, Fromagination is here to rescue!  Friendly and knowledgeable store tenders stand behind the cheese display \"fridges\". Don't be intimidated. The cheese \"sommeliers\" are really friendly and always ready to slice you a little piece of whatever cheese you're interested in.   I also really LOVE the classes they have at Fromagination. The valentine's day \"Chocholate and cheese\" class was so educational! Such an awesome dessert choice. If you're interested, just ask the cheese \"sommeliers\" for recommendations of which cheeses and chocolates go together ;)   Also, the dessert fridge area is AMAZING. I LOVE the macaroons they have from new orleans. Keep in the freezer for months and they taste SO GOOD. Also, the gelato is really good too.  Fromagination also are really nice at supporting local businesses. For example, they have been supporters of Quince & Apple since they began! I love the mini jars they carry. Great for bringing as carry-on gifts on the plane! Also, the wisconsin natural acres honey is amazing. And potter's crackers. OH SO GOOD. You can get individual Gail Ambrosius truffles!!!! amazing.  Cheese. I'm so grateful they carry amazing selections like Bleu Mont's bandaged cheese YAYY, Dunbarton's blue (blue cheese/cheddar mix) etc etc.  Also, if you're shy, they have various cheeses already sliced around the cheese \"fridges\". And other samples. LOVE Fromagination's generosity!  Thank you Ken and the gang, you're always the trust worthy place to go to when I need to get gifts for friends and family!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this spot when visiting Madison due to great reviews and what I have heard from others.  However, when we visited, were early afternoon and they were out of sandwiches except for 1.  It was a really good sandwich (that we had to share), but would have loved to be able to try something more.  I'm not entirely sure why the they don't make more (maybe it gets too busy sometimes?), but would have been nice to be allowed to try some others.  We also weren't entirely sure about drink options, so we just shared a quick sandwich (outside).  I also was uncomfortable because the folks behind the counter were talking with friends or associates in front of the counter and ignored us for a little while.  We weren't really sure how things worked, and it would have been great to have been greeted a little more warmly upon entry.  The spot seems to have a nice selection of cheeses and also a few gift items.  I think if I were a local, I'd visit to find some interesting items.  Things were a bit pricey but quality seemed high. I just was less than pleased with my lunch selections."}
{"text":"This is THE ideal cheese shop experience. We had the pleasure of working with Shannon. She was genuine, hospitable, patient and helpful! A delightful experience, the cheese sampling process was like being a kid in a candy store. We left with large smiles on our faces and cheese in our hands. In this shop lives a true taste of Wisconsin culture, hospitality and Cuisine."}
{"text":"Excuse me but I think I may have just stumbled upon heaven.   Why/how have I not been here yet. It's a cheese lovers paradise! And jams and chocolates and honey and crackers and etc etc etc. So many different types of cheeses you could get lost in your taste buds.  Service was also excellent.. We had someone helping us the entire time we were there, and he even introduced us to our new favorite cheese, the Mobay. He was very knowledgeable about all of the different types of cheeses and where they had come from. It was truly impressive.   I will probably never get cheese anywhere else (goodbye bank account!)"}
{"text":"This stop on my trip was amazing ! They have an entire case dedicated to Wisconsin Cheese ! YUM ! The staff here was super helpful in helping me make my selections ! I loved everything I tried and ended up coming out of there with plenty of goodies !"}
{"text":"Stellar cheese store in Madison. All kinds of local artisan cow, goat, and sheep cheeses, plus a bewildering variety of exotic cheeses from across the pond. Also local artisan chocolates and sausages. Friendly staff, liberal with samples and advice. Well worth a visit. It is expensive, but what good things aren't? I note that several other reviewers have complained about service. All I can say is, each time I've been in the store, the service has been great. This is Madison, not NY or LA - life is at a different pace here, you have to go in there with the frame of mind that you are ready to take some time to browse, think, sample, chat, then everything will go well."}
{"text":"Updated review**  My wife and I tried some sandwiches from Fromagination today.  They were amazing.  I guess that is what you get when you use all very high quality ingredients.  Obviously the meat and cheese was the best you could get, but they add little extras like cranberry spread and olive tapenade that puts it even further over the top.  Their expertise is finding the best meats and cheeses and matching them.  So when they create a sandwich you should know it is probably the best combination you'll find.  The meat and cheese is so good, it is easy to forget the other fresh veg and bread involved.  They are there and they taste great, but I don't order the ham sandwich because of the fresh lettuce.    The soup was excellent.  Definitely the best take out soup.  It was interesting how you could taste each ingredient separately and melded together at the same time.    Overall I'd say if you put these items in a fancy restaurant you'd pay twice as much and you'd still think it was amazing.    ****** First Review They have a great variety of cheeses and other artisan products.  I'm a bit of a novice in the artisan world, but everything I have tried has been amazing."}
{"text":"Seriously, what's not to like? A beautful boutique cheese store in the heart of the dairy capital of the universe!   The owner, Ken, has a real ability to draw you in. Personable and incredibly knowledgeable, he has very well trained staff who can reel off information about any of the cheeses in their gorgeously decorated deli cases. Not being raised here, I had a limited repertoire of cheese likes (one of which was Laughing Cow... no judging please!) but Fromagination has turned me from the evil ways of mass produced cream cheese, and showed me the joy of a well churned slice of cheesy glory. Well, I still have a little Laughing Cow triangle every now and again!  For me, the best part is being able to try-before-you-buy, with someone guiding your selections every step of the way, by asking you questions about your tastes and preferences. I've found several cheeses this way that I would never have purchased otherwise.  I've taken them up on their offer of a little area of outside seating, and sampled several of their amply portioned sandwiches (not all in one sitting of course!) and highly recommend any of them!   Top tip? Head in just before Concerts on the Square to fill your picnic basket -- everything is so fresh and delicious, it really enhances the experience!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've ordered some great gifts online from them, and when I was recently in Madison I had to stop by. They have an amazing selection of cheeses, but I wasn't as blown away as I had hoped. Maybe it was because they were a bit busy, but no one said hello or offered any help until we had been in the store for at least 15 minutes. I guess that just turned me off a little bit. However, if I lived nearby I can imagine that I would be in here a lot. They have some good looking cheeses in those cabinets, and I would eagerly try every one at least once."}
{"text":"We've been staying at a hotel on the Square for a few days and I've already been to Fromagination twice and will probably go back to buy gifts again before I leave tomorrow.   It's comparable to Murray's cheese shop in NYC. There's a wide variety of cheese as well as preserves, chocolates, wine/beer, ice cream, and cheese related kitchen gadgets (knives, blocks, books, etc.). They serve sandwiches, soups, and salads as well. They always have samples too and the service is very friendly and knowledgeable.  One star lost because they don't make a GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH! How can you be a cheese shop and not do grilled cheese?!? I also didn't appreciate the 'tude when I asked if they had a grilled cheese sandwich...I can read the menu thank you, I was just wondering how a cheese shop that sells sandwiches can't just get a sandwich press and serve the MOST delicious cheese sandwich there is. That's all."}
{"text":"Really good cheese knowledge by owner.  My wife and I and another couple really enjoyed a plate of cheese and wine, while sitting outside at their cafe tables and enjoying the square!!  We'll do it again for sure."}
{"text":"I know that this is a cheese shop, but I seriously had the best potato chip here. Look for the chips in the brown paper bags...they are mind-blowing.  Other than amazing potato chips, they make tasty sandwiches ready to go. I had a turkey one with Brie and a unique jam, but it was the bread that really stood out. They also have a great selection of candies, including Dean & Deluca products, and cute gifts for any foodie. Friendly staff, yummy samples and nice outdoor seating. If only they had fresh baguettes to go!"}
{"text":"Knowing that our spring break hosts will expect cheese from us, coming from Wisconsin, we turned to this well-known spot for all things fromage.   Our original mission was to ask if they had some nice cheese we could, say, bring in our carry on bags, and how long could it sit out in room temperature, but we were quickly derailed by the panoply of other edible and tasteful gifts lining the store. Though relatively smaller in space than I expected, we were able to browse unbothered, until we finally pulled it together to approach the counter.   Our man behind the counter had all the answers we could hope for (\"the FDA says 4-6 hours, but really any of the cheeses sitting out right now except those in the fresh case could handle the trip, especially in this weather\") and was passionate (\"really, these need to sit out for 30 minutes before consuming -- it's like wine it needs to decant...but I'm getting off topic\"). Our answers satiated, we looked forward to coming back just before our trip to make the purchase, but lingered around a little longer.   Suddenly he appeared with a board, no words, just two specially cut samples of cheese. We sampled those. Then we talked about the cheese. Then we looked at some more cheese. He asked if we wanted to try any of the other cheeses.   We were indecisive; we are not the cheese experts, we thought, just the tasters. Without another word, he picked up a cheddar block (after I had poo poo'd on cheddar -- bold move) and cut us another two samples. This european cheddar, this was not your orangey, in your face cheddar.   I changed my mind about cheddar at first crunch, and we had a short discussion on crystallization. We left with half of what was left of that cheddar and ate the whole thing that night, paired with a bottle of wine from Square Wine Co down the street."}
{"text":"Meh. I walked in here before going on a run, so I probably looked like a bummed out college kid, but they COMPLETELY ignored me... WTF!?   Forget this place. I hate being treated like I don't deserve service just because I don't look a certain way."}
{"text":"Tasty cheese, perfect to pack up and take on the road for a picnic. Wish we had something this great back home. Has the house sandwich with brie and cranberries, amazing!"}
{"text":"Very helpful and knowledgeable staff and very friendly! I purchased cheese gifts for my office staff while on vacation."}
{"text":"OMG CHEESE!  My friend took me here on my first visit to Madison. After coming back from several months in France and feeling quite cheese deprived as of late, it was awesome to go in here. Staff was extremely friendly and happy to give suggestions.  Check out the basket of cheese orphans near the register - you can get tiny odd-shaped slices of high-end cheese to take home if you don't set aside money for a cheese budget. I tried a cheese I've never seen before - Mobay, sheep and goat milk cheese separated by a layer of ash. So good!  Plus they've got tons of cool spreads and honeys and gifty items :)"}
{"text":"Fromagination is much more than a cheese shop. That's saying something for a land that produces A LOT of cheese. Cheese shops in Wisconsin are like Starbucks in Seattle, there are a lot of them.  Fromagination is the type of place that you can stop in and just pick up some great cheese or you can pick up lunch as they make wonderful sandwiches, have some fine beer and wine as well as other snacks and merchandise. They have a large selection of cheeses and their website provides a description of their various cheeses and awards. We knew we didn't have a lot of time so we comprised a list of 5 cheeses that we would like to try.  When we arrived they were pretty busy. It felt good to come inside from the cold and they were even handing out cups of cider to all their patrons. The nice young lady who was helping us asked for our list and proceeded to slice off a couple of pieces of cheese for us to try. I'm sure one could peruse all their cases of cheese and pick some out. That just isn't the way we roll. As we tried our selections some certainly stood out more than others. We settled on a couple that we really liked and had those packed up to go. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well as knowledgeable.   Fromagination is an upscale cheese shop with a comfortable feeling. I would love to try one of their sandwiches sometime as they sound excellent as does the smoked blue cheese that they had. How good would that be with some buffalo wings!  We look forward to visiting again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"although yes, their cheese is more expensive than what you would get elsewhere. but nonetheless, they have so much selection and they are good. YOU MUST TRY THEIR SANDWICHES"}
{"text":"Cheese heaven! I visit Fromagination whenever I come to Madison. A fabulous and varied selection of cheese with a focus on Wisconsin cheese. The owner and her staff are very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. Also an eclectic selection of housewares and condiments. Get a glass of wine and enjoy the store. Or order wine and cheese plate and sip on the patio. This shop is a must for anyone who enjoys food!"}
{"text":"Good cheese?  Yes.  Various paraphernalia?  Yes.  Good attitude?  No.  We stopped here yesterday, and were surprised by the cold attitude of the staff.  We bought some of the cheese, but they made no effort to offer samples.  There were some samples that had been pre-cut and left out, probably for hours, though.  We came back today with a Grupon, and the staff member was quite put out that we hadn't called in advance to get a reservation.  Nowhere on the Grupon did it suggest that it was needed.  We were served, but with rudeness and coldness.  In addition, I bought a sandwich from them.  Due to the fact that there was an Art Walk going on and there were many people coming into the shop, they had pre-made many sandwiches.  The roast beef sandwich I bought was unpleasant.  For cheese, yes.  Otherwise, eh."}
{"text":"LOVE Fromagination, but it's one of those \"dangerous\" places for me -- I have to be careful how often I go, because it can be a hit on the wallet. It's kind of like a mini-Zingerman's experience here in Madison. Obviously, this is a great place to go if you're looking for cheese, and it's nice that you can sample anything (and they mean anything) in the cheese case and have as many samples as you deem necessary to make your purchase decisions. We've also gotten wine, beer, crackers, relish and some chocolate from here from time to time, but mostly cheese. One of my husband's and my favorite things to do is to buy a baguette and a little sopressata or salami, and then pick up a handful of the cheese \"orphans\" they keep up by the cash register. Instant dinner, and you get to try out some new cheeses. This shop is a little downtown Madison treasure."}
{"text":"Fromagination has a plethora of cheese, fancy spreads, upscale grocery items, and really good sandwiches.   Though this connection may have been planted by their line of Dean and Deluca in the store, that is very much what this reminded me of, but heavy on cheese (as is appropriate in Wisconsin).   The store would be an ideal place to create a gift basket, sample local specialties, or take home a souvenir, which is exactly what took me to Fromagination.   In town for a conference and with very little chance to get out during our stay, this was a last stop to pick up some orphan cheese (odd sized bits from more traditional cuts I assume), a gift or two, and a sandwich for the plane.   I had the swiss, apple, turkey, with a maple mayonnaise. I generally dislike mayonnaise, but this was a great addition to this sandwich.   Prices are reasonable for the selection, brand, and quality of goods sold. I'd be back if I were in town, for sure."}
{"text":"Plus side: great selection of cheese.  If this store were in Los Angeles I'd give it six stars.  But we're in Wisconsin.  Hook's cheese costs twice as much as from Hooks directly.  I expect a mark up, but that's a chunk of change.  Charge more for the stuff from Spain...I get that."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Fromagination, I was overwhelmed...so many, many, many wonderful cheeses! I could have spent a day's wages in a few minutes. The fellow behind the counter saved me from bankruptcy and put together a sweet sampler with half a dozen Wisconsin cheeses, about 2 oz. each. Not a huge investment, and they were excellent, every single one. We've been back several times since. Fromagination has the potential to be intimidating, but the staff keeps it real...they know their cheeses, and genuinely want you to leave with something you'll love."}
{"text":"The place has a wonderful selection of cheeses as well as things to go with them- bread, crackers, ect. The best thing is the wonderful staff. Everyone is so helpful and knowledgeable about everything in the store."}
{"text":"Awesome cheese shop with lots of other goodies (food and non-food), too many to list.  If you live in the area, you must make a routine visit.  If you don't live in the area or are from out of town, you must visit.  During my one week stay in Madison, I visited Fromagination twice, both times to pick up their sandwiches to go.  D-licious!   They have a couple of tables outside of their store, in the shade of the trees, for customers to sit and enjoy their purchase."}
{"text":"When you enter the store, the smell of cheese hits you like the potpourri at Victoria's Secret. Heavenly! We wandered around sampling, ohhhing, and ahhhing over all the delectable's. Then settled on a bottle of Prosecco and a cheese platter at the tables out front overlooking the Capital.  Seriously, does it get any better than this?  Make sure you talk to Priscilla while you are there. She is a wealth of knowledge and really fun too!"}
{"text":"Amazing, fantastic cheese fantasy. I would go back to Madison just for this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful little cheese shop with a variety of cheeses you've never heard of or heard of but never tasted. You can buy small pieces - orphans, they call them - so that you can taste without spending a bundle. There are gifts for foodies, too: jams, confits, crackers, etc. Really friendly staff and great sandwiches. Wish this had been around during my days at UW-Madison."}
{"text":"Cheese. More cheese. Wisconsin cheese, and not just cheddar. Gruyere, spanish style cheese, goat and sheep varieties. And if you want cheddar, you can get 5 yr/10 yr/12 yr versions. Besides Wisonsin cheese, they have a great assortment of cheeses for any purpose you might need.   In addition to cheese, they have all sorts of other food products that go with cheese - crackers, jams, serving items, etc.   For those with a sweet tooth, they carry a few different Wisconsin made candies and also Dean and Deluca products.  Pro tips: get their signature sandwich - smoked turkey with brie and a raisin/cranberry chutney on multi-grain bread. It's so good, you'll be sad when you're done eating it. Also, if you don't want to commit to a large amount of cheese, they have small \"orphans\" near the counter. You can make an excellent sampling just using those."}
{"text":"As a Wisconsinite, I take good cheese seriously! I'm pleased to report that Fromagination lives up to the hype and my only regret is not discovering this gem sooner.  Recently I decided to pick up sandwiches from Fromagination for a picnic. I settled on the Signature Sandwich and Pasture Harvest Sandwich. As I stopped by later in the day (around 3 pm), the selection was a bit limited and a helpful employee told me their kitchen usually closes around 2 . They sometimes have a few extra sandwiches later in the afternoon, but for more variety I'd recommend going during the lunch hour. However, I was so pleased with both of the sandwiches I got and I'd love to try more of their lunch menu. I thought the Signature Sandwich was particularly awesome with turkey, Brie, cranberry relish and INCREDIBLE wheat bread (seriously, the bread was amazing)!  Having read about it on Yelp previously, I was excited to check out the \"cheese orphans\" which are small pieces of a variety of cheeses. I picked out two, which were a great addition to our picnic. This is a great way to try new cheeses or add variety to your selection without committing to a larger or more expensive piece. I'll definitely be back for more!  The only bummer about Fromagination is that prices are a bit on the expensive side- however I think with the quality & location taken into consideration it is a good value!"}
{"text":"Had a jarringly friendly counter-woman, which may be standard for Wisconsin.  On a road trip through we only had time for a quick lunch, and I think we made the perfect choice.  The store is littered with samples. We each ordered sandwiches which came with cornichons (I could take or leave) and a chocolate square (perfect ending). Surprisingly affordable sandwich deal for such a place, but otherwise pretty pricey.   As I approached the counter I kept finding things I had to buy, cheese squeaks (were great on the road), \"orphans\" (little cut ends of cheese for $2-4), beer (self explanatory).   We headed out to the patio with sandwiches and haul in tow, but kept eyeing the grassy patch across the street for a picnic. We weren't sure what the rules were about drinking beer outside of designated restaurant areas, and inquired within. Not only did she say it was fine, the perfect picnic blanket appeared from her hands and we proceeded to have a genuinely great meal in the sun, on the grass, by city hall, watching the protesters and chipmunks scurry around us.  Anyway, this counter woman facilitated a great meal, the bread is universally delicious and sandwich appropriate, though I was partial to the sunflower seed thing used for the PBJ. The cranberry relish on their turkey and the jelly used on PBJ were both similar, chunky, sweet and tasty. Smoked chicken was creamy and the cheese was mild, but could have used a more bitter green on it. I wish I had tried the Salami. Across the board, my only complaint is that I wish the cheeses had been more prominent on the sandwiches, and that I wish they had some kind of grilled cheese/pure cheese sandwich on offer.  I had a local Wisconsin red ale (Quisconsin I think?), a friend had a cider. Both went well."}
{"text":"We finally got the rest of our order after placing an order in mid December and having them mess the shipping up. Had to call twice to get it done, but it's done and we appreciate it!"}
{"text":"The cheese here is absolutely amazing. You can taste as much as you like and they'll sell you cheese in any quantity you'd want. The staff is super friendly, too!  Oh, and they also have a case full of Jeni's ice cream. I highly recommend the goat cheese + cherry."}
{"text":"My favorite thing in this place has to be the cheese orphans. It doesn't appear to be discounted, but it is nice that you can buy many small slivers of different cheeses when you just want to sample or chew on different ones. In addition to cheese, they also sell jams, honeys (including a spicy honey!), and some knick knacks. It's almost like Madison's version of a gift shop when you're looking for something to bring back home."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I wavered a bit with this review's rating. I would like to visit Fromagination a few more times to form an accurate opinion, but this review reflects my first impression only.   There are quite a few things I admired and found lacking from visiting the shop on a Farmer's Market Saturday, but I think that overall Fromagination is definitely worth a visit. It is basically a Madison landmark at this point, no?   Walking in at mid-day during one of the busiest days, the store was expectedly crowded. However, that didn't prevent the employees from being attentive and trying to offer assistance to the many customers milling about the cheese cases.   The knowledgeable staff is just one of the shop's perks: the store features a small, but carefully curated selection cheese, meat, and other accompaniments. If you are hosting a party and need cheese plate or charcuterie advice, this is a great place to go. Also, a good gift destination.   The two things I didn't love: the cheese selection was much smaller than I expected. This is a also a benefit, because it means that all of the cheese sold is intentionally chosen and guaranteed to be good. However, with so many amazing cheeses in Wisconsin, I was disappointed that the selection here was so limited. However, there are other local stores like the co-op that fill this need. The main draw od Fromagination is curation and expertise, not selection.  The second issue is that the prices are pretty high, but I think, considering product quality, they are justifiably so.   Anyway, definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Fromagination is a very small shop, packed full of people and oozing to the brim with items for sale. So many adorable and cute things to buy! Plus a million and one types of cheese.   They have just about every cheese you could possibly want which is fun but the prices! The prices on the cheese and all the cute gift items were quite astronomical. They had a couple of cheeses out to try but they had clearly been sitting out for awhile...they were dried up and didn't look at all appetizing so we didn't dare touch them. I walked in excited about the shop but my four friends and I walked out empty handed & confused."}
{"text":"This is probably the best cheese shop I've ever been to.  Phil guided me through the process today, and I stuck around awhile just to hear how excited he got about his offerings. As a visitor from out of town just looking to try some authentic Wisconsin dairy, he recommended a spread from the smaller cuts of cheese near the register, and then guided me through the accompanying beer as well.   I took home an extraordinary spread - including the Evalon Saxon Creamery, Bellavitano, and Smoked Farmstead Gouda to name a few faves, plus a fresh baguette and a New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red. It was the perfect French-style picnic to bring back to the hotel room, and I'll happily return anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD.   CHEESEGASM.  Caps lock absolutely necessary, fyi. I had the great fortune of being invited to an event held by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Association...it was held at Fromagination. The event, you ask? Well, that would be a grand celebration of Grilled Cheese Month!  Yes, it exists, and yes, it is AWESOME.  There was good beer (several varieties of New Glarus), an awesome spread of cheeses, and of course--GRILLED CHEESE. The chef at Fromagination is the guy who came up with the recipes--whether it was the stuffed french toast topped with marscapone and bourbon maple syrup, the bandaged aged cheddar with peppercorn and green apple, or the gouda and blue cheese melt (there were a bunch more), everything was top notch!  If you like cheese, go here. Like meat? Go here! Most of their meat is from Underground Meat, and it was all spectacular. The breads were from Batch!  My friend (my +1) wanted me to make a point--one I agree with--about the service/employees: they were absolutely awesome in every way imaginable. Highly informed, answered all questions we may have had (like what Whiskey was in the ice cream?), and seemed pretty intent on ensuring we had some sort of beverage in our hands at all times (the other hand had noms in it). Just...outstanding.  Oh, how I love you Fromagination. And oh yes, I will most certainly be returning for your cheeses...just thinking about the smoked cheddar is making me drool!"}
{"text":"Elegant storefront, top-notch quality and service, serious cheese-mongers. They're patient and generous with sampling, a must because of the wide range of cheese palettes out there. They also have terrific sandwiches, beers, and salamis. Some cheeses are quite pricey, but think of them like fine wine or a fine cigar--you buy such products for a nuanced tasting, not to melt. Their dedication to carrying local artisanal cheeses makes this a must-visit on the square."}
{"text":"Psssst....  Hey.....  You wanna pay 35$/lb for some cheese?  I gotchu fam  First sample is free.  Seriously, this is the best cheese shop in the city, and it is easy to spend a ridiculous amount of money here.   Not great for dine in or take out, fantastic for getting dinner supplies."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have two friends who work here, though I have done as much as possible not to let this affect my review. I have been going to Fromagination every holiday season for years to send the parents of my (then-)boyfriend a holiday cheese box as a Christmas gift. I appreciate that the options can be viewed online, and Fromagination has boxes for many price points. They have always seemed a tiny bit overpriced, but knowing the high quality contained within, I've found it fairly reasonable. (The parents mentioned above are now devotees of Potter's Crackers and a particular type of caramels they used to include (though not the La-Di-Da caramels they currently have.)  Fromagination has helped me find presents for fellow expats who believe that, even though they live in California, the happiest cows come from Wisconsin. This may or may not have led to an infamous event in which I took Limburger (the only dairy that can produce it in the US is in WI) on a plane to San Francisco with a box of fennel crackers. The recipient was very grateful for a taste of home, no matter how smelly it might be.  The employees have an encyclopedic knowledge of all things cheese, and will enthusiastically share their expertise with you, helping you to find whatever it is you need for any occasion, as well as whatever accouterments that might go well with your cheese, such as salamis, cornichons, and dried (or fresh) fruit. They also carry a number of non-cheese specialty items. Local distributors and creators are the primary focus, but products considered exceptional from around the world are present. I can testify to the enthusiasm of the staff; a friend who works there loves visiting family farms for tours and tasting, always learning more. This is a store where the employees love to pass on their passion for cheese to the customers, which is always a good thing to see. Though it is often bustling, lines move quickly and everyone is courteous. Every cheese in the store is up for sampling, which is encouraged. If you are vegetarian, they know which cheeses use synthetic rennet. Recently, they began to offer sandwiches, which are expensive but delicious and freshly-made with quality ingredients by an employee when you order them. They also have a selection of drinks (alcoholic and non-), which is great for a weekday lunch downtown or a trip to Concerts on the Square. They often have community education classes, too, which I appreciate. If it weren't for the often-hefty price tag, I'd be in here a lot more often. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Fromagination is an adorable boutique type shop that's straight out of my cheesiest dreams. The selection of cheese and cheese related items here is fantasmic. So. Much. Cheese. It doesn't just stop there though, they also have a nice selection of cured meats, cheese servingware, candies, dry snacks, jams, beer... and the list goes on. The store is tiny, but there are so many unique and cool things to oggle that you don't want to miss.   That being said, it sucks that such a great, unique store lacks so much when it comes to customer service. The workers here give off a pretentious vibe and are very curt. I had a few questions and was looking for something in particular but it was impossible to get the attention of any of the staff. I guess having your back turned to the counter and unwrapping stuff is more important that focusing on customers in the store.  I did end up choosing my own cheese and buying it, but the worker who rang me up wasn't very friendly and at that point I didn't feel comfortable trying to ask about anything else. Sorry for giving you my business? You'd think that a store that is so specialized with so much to offer would be more forthcoming with trying to educate customers so that they can really enjoy their products. Guess not.   Good selection, but the experience is almost equivalent to going to the grocery store deli and picking out your own cheese. The customer service just doesn't exist here. Heck, the deli guy at the grocer's would probably be more friendly and I'd bet that it's probably cheaper there too."}
{"text":"Fantastic cheese shop! The staff is knowledgable and helpful plus they have a great selection. We got a bunch of little hunks of cheese from the 'orphan bin' to make a picnic. It's a great way to try something new. They also have a variety of honey, jams, salts and so on. Overall it was the best shop I visited in Madison."}
{"text":"Spent $25 a pound for a lovely buttermilk bleu cheese. Got back to Idaho and am regretting not buying the whole wheel. Staff was fantastic, made recommendations, let us try samples. Will definitely return on our next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Five star products. But horrible service on both occasions.  They got everything to make an excellent cheese broad. Wide ranges of cheeses, salami, preserves, chocolates, crackers, plates, boards cookbooks and knives and other cookware. They also have other local products too. Beer, honey, syrups, and lot more i'm forgetting probably.  Now to the service.  First occasion came in at about 10 min before they were closing on a Saturday. First thing a girl said when walking in is that they were closing soon. Ok just getting a feel of what they all carry anyway since I saw when walking in the time of closing on the door. Then she proceed to say well then take a quick walk through. Now 10 minutes is enough time to just see what they all carry. Then I hear  \"5 Minutes till closing\" then \"Were closed\" felt like she was pushing me out the door. Then locked the door right when the door closed. Would of been great to talk to just one of the employees working that night about the place while looking around. But nope.  Second time not to good. Went on a Sunday after brunch. Got a hello when I enter and there was about 5 other people in the shop while I was their. They was 4-5 employees working one was at the register and one was helping picking out cheese for a customer and 2-3 doing whatever. One was the girl from last time. I was there for about 20 minutes and not once did anybody ask if I need any help. On one insistent I was reading the back on a product I hear someone say \"Excuse me\". Which was an employee moving products around. I was looking at the items he needed to move. Never asked if I had any questions. Just wanted to get his \"project\" done.  I was happy to see Quince & Apple and Tera Whey products which I LOVE. But I can get those by other means. Did end up buying a Goat Cheese Kit. It has all you need to make the cheese but the goat milk. My cheese loving/home cook brother will love this. But I also can get this online.  One strike, two strike. A third strike your out?"}
{"text":"The signature sandwich was incredible.  I wish we had a restaurant like this in DE!  Definitely a place I'll come back to on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Well worth a visit for cheese lovers. Fromagination is across the street from the state capital building and the shop has a terrific selection of Wisconsin cheese. The staff is very knowledgeable and quite patient to boot.   You can sample any cheese in the shop and they have a variety of charcuterie, chocolate, and merchandise as well."}
{"text":"A nice assortment of cheeses including some locally made cheeses from Wisconsin in downtown Madison. Nice store, nice people."}
{"text":"We were visiting from AZ last week and went to the concert on the capitol square.  My girlfriend stopped in here to get something to bring back to our spot on the lawn and they really took care of us.  The turkey, cranberry and Camembert sandwich was awesome.  Top quality ingredients that really went well together.  A nice bottle of red wine that they opened for us and a couple of plastic glasses and we were all set for the concert picnic!"}
{"text":"I really just do not like this place.  I know it is the cool thing to love it.  However, I find it completely overwhelming.  As a person with no knowledge of cheese, getting service to ask a question is nearly impossible.    They do not cater to those people new to cheese.  And when you get poor service it makes the smell a bit much to handle.    I wanted to buy cheese, even though it was pricey, but they do not seem to have enough staff to address their customers.  I found it annoying that some of them were chatting behind their counter.  I wish I could review your cheese but I can not get past your service."}
{"text":"This is one of the best cheese shops I have ever been to. Outstanding selection and helpful workers make it hard to decide which delicacies to bring home. I walked out knowing quite a bit more about the Wisconsin cheese industry and with a slightly lighter wallet."}
{"text":"Parking is difficult downtown, but after circling a few times we got a spot in front.  We sampled some cheese and picked out several we loved.  I asked if they had any Italian cheese, and apparently Wisconsin takes their cheese very seriously, as I was told \"we only sell Wisconsin cheese\".  California cheese shops sell everything, even Wisconsin, so I didn't realize there was a difference.  Then we had them make up a gift basket which was very nice.  Although they have many options, I doubt I will visit again, primarily because we love all cheese and we don't want the limitation."}
{"text":"Today is National Cheese Day, and what better way to celebrate than to review a cheese establishment! I dedicate this review to the Cheese Masters of Madison at Fromagination. Although I am a lactard (lactose intolerant/envious), I can objectively say that Fromagination is cheese heaven.  Everyone I've spoken to that's sampled their selection has given them positive notes. I personally have sampled their goat cheeses (fun fact: goat cheese is lactose-free)- super fun! The employees are very welcoming & knowledgeable, so don't be afraid to ask a million questions (like I do, lol). My favorite thing to do on my lunch break is to stop in, grab some Bold Billy Goat Sweet Potato Chips, and browse the adorable trinkets, snax, and cheese-themed paraphernalia. I even found a cheese pin for a friend that moved away from Wisconsin, so that they'd never forget their Dairyland roots. :-)  *pro-tip: hosting a party? They've got charcuterie, sandwich & cookie trays out the wazoo!   Don't be morose; have some lactose!"}
{"text":"Located in the capital square, you can't miss this gem. Sure, it is a small space and can get a bit packed, but the staff is fantastic and will help you with samples or your order in no time. Yes, it will be pricier than the Mouse House, but the selection is to die for and you can try before you buy or advise the amount you want to purchase, and they are happy to shave down that hunk of cheese to your liking.  Love the small portions you can buy for under $5 by the cashier.  They have some gift items too if you are in a pinch. Very clean place. Huge fan of this space."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheese curds, they don't have any here so you'll have to scavenge some at the farmer's market across the street. But if you're looking for some specialty cheeses and happen to be in the area, come come! It's a cute cozy cheese shop with an assortment from all over the state as well as many European varieties.   I hadn't intended on buying any cheese since we had a few hours before heading back to Chicago but once the friendly lady behind the counter enticed us with a few samples (they had us at gruyere), it was over from there. They had this really stinky brie but the gruyere was good. They even gave us an ice pack to preserve it. This ice pack is not joke. I thought it'd be some ice cubes in a plastic ziplock but it was this fancy commercial reusable pack that probably cost more than the orphans (see below). I thought that was nice touch.  Anyhow go inside for a gander. Sample some cheeses. Try some crostini, check out some accompaniments like crackers and mustards, fig jams, etc. It's not cheap but this isn't Kraft's cheese either. At the register they have a ton of mini cheese pieces that are called \"orphans\" so you can buy a bunch to take home and try without digging deep into your pockets. I was particularly happy with the 2 yr aged parmesan and gruyere!"}
{"text":"My cheese heaven every time I visit! The staff is so helpful with getting me cheeses that hold up well for travel! They also sell chocolate and other goodies. I could stay in here for hours. Wisconsin cheese is awesome!"}
{"text":"If, like me, your goal is to eat your weight in cheese, then Fromagination is your kinda place.   Any cheese your heart dreams of can likely be found here, and proudly made with Wisconsin love.  In addition to many, many cheeses, they carry all kinds of crackers, jellies, mustards, barbecue sauces from Chicago's own Lillie's Q, Dean & Deluca products, spices, WI beers and wines, utensils and other accoutrements for maximum cheese eating pleasure, and also make sandwiches to go. We bought a ton of cheese and sat and ate our bounty on the lovely steps of the Capitol, which is close by.   Fromagination is a cheese lover's paradise!"}
{"text":"I take back anything snarky I may have said about Fromag, 'cause today and yesterday I enjoyed their AWESOME, NEW Chicken and Adobo Pepper sandwich. NUM!!  Spicy but  not too; quality of bread tastes homebaked and is superlative.  Spread with just the right amount of pesto sauce and some (Munster?) cheese slices added, along with tender pieces of grilled or baked chicken breast, sprinkled with some leafy greens.  For dessert I chose a scrumptious chocolate chip cookie.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"A true Madison original and example of how local can be sophisticated, fun and exciting, Fromagination brings together the best Wisconsin cheeses with only the best from around the country and around the globe.  Based on vast research, knowledge and personal relationships with the cheesemakers whose cheeses stock the store, Fromagination is able to offer some truly special cheeses for people who crave something more than the bland, mass-produced yellow bricks available in the grocer's dairy section.  Be forewarned, Fromagination smells like a French épicerie - in other words, it's stinky, but delightfully so.   The ambiance in Fromagination is one of its best features, and the store is fully brimming with choice curated items to accompany your cheese eating, including housewares items such as fine cutlery, spice racks and dishware, Dean and Deluca herbs, a nice selection of mustards, vinegars, crackers, chocolates, macaroons, from the area and from abroad. Anyone who has seen a Roost wholesale catalog will recognize many of the items from there, too.   Beer and wine is also available at Fromagination, including options already chilled and ready to take home.  You can also find other specialty items in the cold cases, such as a number of cured meat products (Spanish chorizo, prosciutto, and the like) and Jeni's ice cream.  The Isthmus newspaper and others have already praised the ready-to-eat sandwiches on a mini baguette, with Maille cornichons on the side.  They may seem pricey at first, but they are delightful.  In nicer weather, consider purchasing a number of cheese \"orphans,\" small pieces of the various cheeses that are available as leftovers from larger pieces, and have them arranged on a plate with crostini or crackers, then sit outside under the café umbrellas and enjoy the view of the state Capitol.  Fromagination has become a destination shop for locals and visitors alike, and it will come as no surprise to you as to why.  The service, selection and experience will win you over.  If you are a cheese lover, you will undoubtedly become a Fromagination frequent flyer after your first visit."}
{"text":"Great artisan cheese shop with great sandwiches. My favorite sandwich is the turkey and cranberry, it is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Also the sandwiches are moderately priced at 7.50 which isn't too much more than a chain sub."}
{"text":"Small and quiet with an abundant array of gourmet gifts. However, it would be nice if they posted kitchen hours in addition to shop hours as I learned they are not the same; then after peak lunch time, you cannot order from the menu displayed, rather, you are limited to a small selection of undesirable leftovers...no thanks."}
{"text":"I was expecting to walk into a boring, traditional-style deli and cheese shop and boy, was I mistaken! Fromagination goes beyond just cheese with a selection of sandwiches, jams, sauces, crackers, books and other kitchen decor/ accessories. It took such restraint not to buy everything the shop has to offer. I went in on a Saturday and there was a sommelier offering wine tastings, something you don't see much in Madison. I loved her explanation of the wine and even ended up purchasing a bottle, as well as the cheese she recommended pairing it with.  I also highly recommend trying the sandwiches, the Vegiletta is delicious, though I do wish they heated them up instead of serving them cold."}
{"text":"amazing products.  They have the best cheese I've ever tasted.  The staff is super friendly.  They have bite size pieces to full wheels of cheese you could buy.  Also, they have wine connoisseurs, which helped for our cheese & wine party."}
{"text":"Unbelievable cheese and gourmet food store on the capital square next to Inn on the Park hotel.  The staff is very helpful in this place and really knows their cheese.  They often have little samples available to taste or ask them to taste any of the cheeses in their cases.  They also sell lots of other stuff like jams, honey, crackers, nuts and more.  You can also buy cheese related gifts, knives, plates and other cute little items. While not the biggest store, Fromagination is someplace special and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I can't imagine giving Fromagination any less than 5 stars because this is how a business should be run and operated in Madison and anywhere else.  Fromagination is amazing for a lot of reasons, but to put it succinctly and bluntly: the only deficit this place has is a lack of seating for customers. That's it. No, really! (OK, it's a little pricey--but you pay for what you get here.)  The business has incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and mild-mannered staff that are willing and able to help you out without being pushy or ostensibly arrogant about it. Their cheeses are fantastic, but the sandwiches.  Oh. My. God. I went to Jamba Juice shortly after to get something to drink and I just had to try it there. I left because I was getting stared at for making so many noises about how damn good my chicken sandwich was!--if you had one, you'd be making them too! Fresh French artisan bread with good chicken and fresh lettuce? With what I believe is a fontina cheese? SOLD!  I also want to give them special props to selling other local Madison businesses like Gail Ambrosius; I was so tempted to get something else, but I'll just have to make that my excuse for coming in again!"}
{"text":"Friendly and informative, a great place to stop in and grab a bite or just try some cheese.  Eat your way through a bunch of different varieties, talk to the staff and have a good time with it.  I really wish they did a grilled cheese- they must; did I miss it?  Also, there's a little area in the back of the store with food-related trinkets, it's unnecessary and makes the space feel a little cluttered."}
{"text":"Fromagination - you know the second you walk in the door that you have arrived at the Shangri-La of Cheddar, the Nirvana of Neufchatel, the Promised Land of Parmesan and at Blue Cheese Bliss! Definitely an artisan shop located right in the heart of Madison that offers so much more than just cheese and was where we decided to grab a sandwich (and also some cheese to satisfy my need to explore different varieties of blue cheese).  Their sandwiches are pre-made and I was told are made fresh every morning. To be entirely honest, I wasn't exactly thrilled about this. My instant reaction was \"So, you're selling gas station sandwiches here?\" and \"I expect more from a shop like this!\". Fairly pricey sandwiches for what is provided which is the only reason I can't give 5 stars. I get it that this is a Capitol Square retail location and rents are much higher compared to a lot of comparable locations. Even with that reasoning, the prices are not justified here... Maybe I am missing something (other than the cost of real estate) but my $8.50 sandwich was pretty much the same thing I can get at Hy-Vee for $6.00.  Was the sandwich good? Yes, it was. I had The Best of the Midwest which included salami, provolone and an olive tapenade. The bread was really good and was probably the highlight of the sandwich. If there was just \"a little more\" to it, I think this sandwich could be a winner and have a justified price tag.  Moving on to the cheese selections - there are a ton! Extremely good selection and a lot of emphasis on customer service and overall customer experience. I chose to blindly order a blue cheese I have not had before and it didn't fail to deliver on taste. My only problem you ask? Again, the price tag. At almost $30.00/lb I expected to have something that made me drool after entering into a blue cheese coma. Instead, I felt like there may be someone in the back room laughing when they watch a customer pay...  I think Fromagination is a great place that brings something to the area that no other store or retail location can. It's a Wisconsin and Midwest store that delivers on sight, sound, smell and taste. It's a good spot for a sandwich (even though it is pre-made) and a great spot to maybe \"try\" some smaller portions of cheese to see what you like. Prior to visiting, make sure your wallet is pre-loaded with cash or your credit card has a high available limit. Even though you may not end up buying a lot, whatever you decide to buy will cost more than expected."}
{"text":"The smell when you walk in the door is worth the visit. The store has a great selection and friendly service. I was able to buy cheese curds to bring home.   I would recommend this shop to foodies and anyone who loves cheese. They have meets and other fun goods available too."}
{"text":"There are just some places that I walk into and I feel like I'm in my happy place, a little giddy, and at peace. This list includes bookstores, tiny cocktail lounges, and Fromagination. The employees are always so helpful. There are usually cheese samples. Delicious sandwiches to be bought during lunch time. Also an awesome place to come if you are looking for a great gift. Whether that be a unique jams, fancy chocolates, condiments, specialty beer or liquor they got it here. How do they cram so much into this small store?  One of my favorite reasons to come here is that they have Jeni's Ice Cream. My favorite ice cream on the planet. And not only do they have Jeni's pints, which I know can be found at some other grocery stores, but they have Jeni's ice cream sandwiches! Yum!  If I'm ever around the capitol I love peeking in here, breathe in the smell of tons of cheeses mingling (sorry sounds weird) and treat myself to something fun whether that be trying a new cheese, getting an ice cream sandwich, or finding what is new in stock.  The only thing that brings this place down a star for me is that I find that some things are a little overpriced. I've noted a couple of things that I recall seeing sold at cheaper prices at other local shops.   However the experience of this place is 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"When traveling through Wisconsin, Madison and this particular shop were on the list because of the Yelp reviews. It's interesting how the reviews for Fromagination would split between rave and 'meh'. I have to go with the latter.  The shop is cute as any posh little shop could be, but definitely overpriced when it comes to their cheese selection. In that variety of everything and nothing, I ended up leaving to my next destination, and leaving a few hundred dollars at Brennan's Market."}
{"text":"A house of cheesy wonders.  Well-located and not afraid to offer samples.  We raided the basket of lonely cheese chunks - odds and ends for sale.  The staff arranged them in a cute little box.  It made a great gift for our petsitter."}
{"text":"When I die, may I be reincarnated as a cheesemongerer and work/eat/live at Fromagination?   Literally, the best cheese I have ever consumed. I got to eat three cheeses and drink a glass of wine while sitting outside and looking at the capital building.   I will order gifts for the rents from here and will indulge prob once more before my return to SF. If I am ever back in Madison- I will return mos def!"}
{"text":"Really cute little shop packed with a huge variety of products.  The employees were very helpful and allowed us to sample many cheese, and also suggested many different cheese to try based on our preferences.  They also really took their time with each individual customer making sure their questions were answered.  So many fun products jammed in this tiny little shop, I'd definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've actually bought a hunk of cheese from here, but I can speak about their sandwiches! They don't make them on Sundays, and there's some sort of limited availability on Saturdays, but they are a great deal. Very reasonably priced (I think around $5), good, chewy bread (the kind I like), and quality insides. They are perfect for a nice spring or summer lunch out on the square or by the lakes."}
{"text":"My parents and I visited here while I was preparing to move to the area.  We ordered sandwiches and also purchased about 15 of the \"orphaned\" cheese corners so we could try a variety.  We ended up spending about $65 and were disappointed.  My sandwich was the best of all of the sandwiches according to my parents and it was merely decent.  My mom's sandwich looked like wonder bread, a couple of slices of green apple, and deli meat/cheese.  The orphaned cheeses were the biggest disappointment - several of the cheeses were hard and appeared dried out (they were dark yellow and crumbly) - I'd love to say that was they way they were supposed to be except that we had gotten a couple of repeats and one orphan would be soft and white with wonderful flavor and the other would be as described above with a bit of a rancid taste.  None of the orphans had expiration dates on them so we couldnt have known they were bad before we unwrapped them.  The only cheese of the bunch that I would purchase again was the gouda with pimiento and garlic.  Only a few of the cheeses were actually awful but it could have been so much better.  I might try getting cheese from the cheese case in the future but definitely wont purchase orphan cheeses again."}
{"text":"oh fromagination... aka cheese heaven. i love you so.  this is definitely one of those places where it's easy to drop a lot of money, so proceed with caution. you will try delicious cheeses, spreads and crackers from wisconsin and abroad. you will ogle elegant and useful kitchen gadgets. and you will probably leave with a bag full of all these things.  i really love the cheese orphan basket near the register. it's a great way to try a new cheese without spending a lot. the staff is always very friendly and helpful. it can get crowded due to the prime location on the square, so it's best to avoid during farmer's markets, etc."}
{"text":"I really wasn't very happy about my experience at Fromagination today.  As many others have mentioned, this is a very nice store with a great selection of wonderful cheeses.  And, as others have mentioned, these cheeses are quite expensive.  I don't have a problem with paying a premium for shopping at a speciality store, but I expect service that is commensurate with the price that is being charged.  That didn't happen.  I went in today (Sunday) at around three in the afternoon, an hour before closing.  There were several other customers in the store, but it wasn't crowded by any means.  Of the six or so employees, at least four were standing at the counter with their backs turned to me preparing holiday shipments.  I stood there for about five or six minutes without being acknowledged.  When someone finally noticed I was there, he asked another employee to help me out.  That employee took about two more minutes to finish the package he had been working on before actually helping me with my purchase.  I was deciding between two cheeses and it really would have been nice to have been offered a taste.  As it stood, I didn't feel comfortable asking for one.  I would expect a store like this to be run by friendly people with a passion for what they do, people who want to spread that passion and convince others that it's worthwhile to be spending such ridiculous amounts on cheese.    In any case, you can stay for an hour or two after closing to prepare packages.  It's rude to stand with your back to customers."}
{"text":"I popped into Fromagination today to grab a jar of Yumbutter's newest concoction (WI cranberries + coconut = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76RrdwElnTU in my mouth). Walking into Fromagination is like walking into the cave in the Goonies (anybody? anybody?) - you're surrounded by so many treasures your eyes dart around not knowing on what to settle first. The walls are packed with local treasures like Potter's crackers, Hawkwind mustards and relishes, Gail Ambrosius chocolates, and fridges full of Wisconsin-native beers. Nevermind the honey samples of which I shameless took about 8. I don't even eat cheese and this place is heavenly. My friend says sandwiches are to die for... I may need to work up to that."}
{"text":"8 oozing reasons you should get your hiny to Fromagination:  -cheese samples -located adorably on the square -friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff -cheese case with labels that describe the queso in Layman's Terms -accoutrements like raw honey, fig jam and truffle vinaigrette are loaded on the shelves (great spot to make a gift basket) -gorgeous atmosphere with French cheese signs and a long wooden table -grilled cheese of the month -and my favorite part: the left over bin with small hunks of great cheese for attractive prices"}
{"text":"Great cheese and gift shop right across from the Capital.  Friendly and knowledgeable cheesemongers. Lots of local and foreign options to choose from. The only downside is the limited wine selection."}
{"text":"When we walked in my boyfriend said, \"It smells like a rat cage in here.\" Although I'm sure he meant that in the sense that rats like cheese...there is definitely a funk. The scent of a good cheese, am I right? This store is pretty much a cheese snob's dream come try. Tons of local cheese and other cheese-related paraphernalia, vinegars, oils, etc. A great place to get a gift for anyone, because who doesn't love cheese?"}
{"text":"Wisconsin cheese is amazing & this is one of the top cheese stores in Madison. I've never tried their sandwiches & don't plan to. It's their cheese that is absolutely incredible. It's better than anything I've ever had & I cannot find anything as good in NYC (for aged Wisconsin cheddar, I haven't found better). Yesterday, tried the Hook's 12 year Sharp Cheddar Cheese (a World Champion Cheese title winner according to the gold label). Oh yeah, this is true gourmet cheddar cheese! What makes it so special? Well, for one, it's slightly crunchy. This is due to calcium lactate crystals formed during the long aging process. And the texture is firm almost dry (not sticky or pasty). The flavor is super-intense. There's definitely something to this cheese! Keep in mind that aged cheeses contain high levels of tyramine - more info at http://www.headaches.org/2007/10/25/low-tyramine-diet-for-migraine/   Also, I'd probably never normally eat something called \"Cow Pie\" but I'm so glad I did. Carmel, pecans & fresh milk chocolate. Simple but OMG.  So fresh, delicious & absolutely decadent."}
{"text":"Fromagination is a lovely small business here in Madison. I recently ordered several cheese and charcuterie baskets as holiday client gifts, and working with the team at Fromagination was fantastic all around. Ken and Kate answered all of my questions promptly and politely, and they took extra care to hand write all the gift messages. They emailed me right away when the packages had been shipped and they even included a discount for my bulk purchase. I will definitely be shopping here again for homemade Wisconsin-themed gifts for friends and clients across the country."}
{"text":"This shop is a dream.  Visited again with a friend from San Antonio this weekend and fell in love with it all over again.  The variety of cheese available is incredible.  Several samples were available for the curious palate.  My buddy had questions and the staff was more than willing to address his questions regarding choices and even TSA cheese policies.  Last time we were here I stuck to the front of the shop. Realized this time that there is a huge selection of locally brewed and distilled goodies on display. Had we not been on a tight airport related schedule, we would have stayed much longer."}
{"text":"Fabulous, well curated shop with a terrific selection of both regional and global cheeses. A great selection of cheese related gifts, books, local chocolates and more. The staff was uniformly lovely, helpful and enthusiastic about the product. Sophie who helped us was not only enthused but but also one of the more knowledgeable cheese mongers we've had anywhere in the US. A very unique shop and worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Back again. Completed the Ironman 70.3 this past Sunday & made sure to visit here 2x. Was like a wide eyed child when I saw the Hooks 10 year cheddar. Asked for a sample. Almost passed out it was so good. Took 3 \"orphan\" pieces back to my room with some frackers & some chocolate of course.   This store is so incredible: service, design, variety of items & gifts & oh...the incredible cheeses!!! Love this place. Madison is lucky to have such a place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Great assortments of so many delicious things, not just cheese--- and the staff is fantastic.  I want to stay here!"}
{"text":"Great selection and friendly staff   Sometimes picking cheese can be overwhelming. You might know a few kinds you want while searching for something different can lead you to too many options to choose from. The cheese had handy labels with descriptions detailing the type of milk and how it tastes so you had a better idea of what things were before asking for help. One employee was nice enough to give us a sample plate to help us and another assisted in recommending toast that didn't take away from the cheese we wanted to present.  Bonus points for the alcohol selection, though I didn't check the prices"}
{"text":"Everything in the store looks so pretty and precious. I popped in here to find birthday gifts for my foodie friend. Besides cheese, Fromagination also carries gourmet preserves, some wines, mustard, tea etc. It could be little overwhelming at first glance, especially the place looking so posh unlike most of Madison. But the staff are friendly, and willing to answer questions and help you select products.  After picking presents for my friend, I decided to pick few more stuff for myself. I knew I had to grab the handcrafted marshmallow when I saw it. The staff also recommended me a chamambert cheese called Fromager des Clarines  - which was so phenomenal. The creamiest delicious cheese ever. Now I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I have a deep love for cheese and this shop couldn't make me happier. Second visit to Madison and second visit to the shop. This time I made it my last visit of the trip so that I could bring home even more yummy cheeses. We also picked up some sandwiches and ate those on the road which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The selection is pretty nice, although I don't think there need to be quite as many non-cheese items stuffed in the store. It felt a little cramped to me. As with many other cheese places, there are little ends and chunks available for a couple of bucks - a nice way to try something new EXCEPT that they tend to be dried out and/or ends/rindy, and aren't discounted! If cheese places marked these pieces down that'd be great, but I've never seen it done. Well, end of that rant. I was a little disappointed that the sandwiches are pre-made and the only eating options are outdoors (it sounds really nice to have a picnic like they offer, but I think that's not a great option for most of the year!)."}
{"text":"This is a place that has some goodness for everyone. Do not go into this place if you are super hungry. I did and spent about $100 on charcuterie. (super delicious charcuterie though) They have sandwiches, lots of picnic foods, great stuff for boating food, snacks for Jazz at 5, concerts on the square, etc. Their sourcing is top notch and they give you samples!"}
{"text":"Wisconsin is known for cheese, so it was a no-brainer to stop by and browse at Fromagination. Located right on the square downtown, they have cases and cases of cheese, including plenty of local Wisconsin cheese. I can't eat as much cheese as I used to due to my lactose intolerance, but it was still fun to look. What's also good is they don't just have cheese, but also sandwiches and salads and other snacks, so picking up a sandwich allowed me to try a little bit of the cheese without going overboard.  We got the chile ancho chicken sandwich, which had roasted chicken breast with a poblano pesto spread, salad greens, and Wisconsin provolone cheese, and sat outside the shop to eat. (They had a whole section of tables and chairs outside, very comfortable.) The bread was soft and soaked up all the flavors of the pesto, the chicken was great, and you could definitely taste the provolone, which was so good and tied it all together. Very glad we stopped by Fromagination."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review again based on the quick response and handling of the spoiled cheese situation by Ken (the owner) and his staff.   I sent them an email yesterday morning to bring the spoiled cheeses to their attention (simply to inform them that they had some spoiled cheeses on display and that they might want to double check the items they were selling) and received a response that afternoon. This morning I received a call from Ken who offered to either refund or replace the cheese that I had ordered, even though I had not requested either of these in my email to them.  This is great customer service, and eases any qualms I may have had about returning to the business!"}
{"text":"Wow - the smell when you open the door - either you're going to love it, or you really won't. It smells like cheese shops should smell - STINKY!   Love - a wide selection, mini pieces near the register for low commitment sampling, a focus on local producers.  Don't Love - yep, they can be a little cold or snotty here. It definitely depends on the person as we've had great experiences here too.  So/so - they have macarons here, very hard to find. The owner said they are imported from France and shipped in frozen. They're not bad texture wise but surely not great.  All in all, it's worth a stop if you are a cheese lover. Saturdays are the worst day to visit as the shop is jammed with Farmers Market shoppers and therefore the staff can get a bit cranky."}
{"text":"Great shop for all of your cheese needs and more!  Love the selection and the cheese orphans - nice little snack! Staff is very helpful and will help you pick out companions and wine to go with your cheese."}
{"text":"Expensive with limited selection. I asked ifthey hadany cheddar other than Hooks.  I was told in a very snobbish tone that,  no, and\"what is wrong with Hooks?\" I 'd rather go to Brennan 's which has a much more extensive selection of cheeses. And fewer snobs."}
{"text":"Dear America's Dairyland,   I've been in Madison for nine months now harboring a secret I'm finally ready to spill. Brace yourself. I'm lactose intolerant. And even if I weren't and could eat all the cheese in the land, I wouldn't, because the texture, the flavor, the color... I find it mildly unappetizing and when I say mildly I mean mildly in the way that I mildly like to get punched in the stomach. Which is what it feels like when i eat cheese, so you understand my aversion, right?   Now aversion aside, I have to tell ya I find Fromagination absolutely delightful! And why? Because even when you ignore the cheese, the foundation of the business, it's still a stellar place! There's meat. There's jam. There's chocolate. And they're delicious! (There's more, but I feel like that should be enough to get you in the door.) Add to this an amazing and knowledgeable staff and you have the makings for an incredible specialty store. They put on some really neat events throughout the month and are an all around awesome place to lunch. I love... LOVE the interior; rustic, warm, and carefully curated.   So in conclusion Wisconsin, I'm sorry you had to find out this way, but dairy I say, I've still found wheys to make it work for me even choosing to leave out the lactose at Fromagination. (That means you can too.)    Yours,   CD"}
{"text":"Fromagination. is. awesome.  I've only been two or three times in my visits to Madison, and believe me - it was more than enough time to fall heads over heels for this cheese shop.  The inside is completely covered in magnificent dark wood and glass, and is chock-full of cheese as far as the eye can see.  They have specials each month, offer free samples of really high quality cheese, and in general seem to offer local and foreign cheese options that have easily been the best cheeses I've ever tasted to date.  I don't know what more to say then to make a stop here if you get the chance!  It's in the heart of downtown and the quality of the cheeses sold is off the charts.  From 1-year aged cheese to 15-year aged cheese, they have it all!  And best of yet, they KNOW the cheeses really well.  In other words, not only do they sell it, but they're connoisseurs of it all at the same time.   If you don't know what to get, just ask and they'll help!  If I were to knock it for anything, maybe sometimes the staff is aloof, and some of the prices of the accompaniments are definitely overpriced (like the chocolates and crackers), but really if you're there for the cheese you won't be disappointed!  Even if you don't want to buy a huge chunk of some specific cheese, grab some of the inexpensive cheese orphans at the front counter, take a bite, and be sent to cheese heaven."}
{"text":"Wisconsin is the America's Dairyland.  In my view, no place showcases WI cheeses better than Fromagination.  This place is truly heaven when it comes to cheese from the state.  Here you'll find pretty much every offering from the usual suspects, such as Carr Valley, Hook's, and Upland, as well from other local smaller creameries.  If you pay them a visit right around now, you may even be lucky enough to get Hook's 15-year aged cheddar and/or Upland's Pleasant Ridge Extra Aged cheeses!  They also offer all the accompaniments, such as crackers, marmalades, and Gail Ambrosius chocolates!  Also, you can't leave this place without trying one of their sandwiches, particularly my favorite - the salami!  From what I remember, sandwiches run for around $7 or $8 a piece.  Overall, don't expect to penny pinch here.  Everything's on the higher end, thus the prices reflect it; however, if you're a big fan of great cheeses, you'll find the premium paid worth your while."}
{"text":"We were passing through Wisconsin and couldn't avoid stopping in for some cheese. Rachel was amazing! She let us try some great cheeses and really taught us a lot about the different kinds. The store looks nice and has at least 100 varieties of cheeses at various price points. All in all, we bought about 5 cheeses and some prociutto for the road. You must visit Fromagination of you're in the area."}
{"text":"Although they have a good selection of cheeses, the store and their employees are definitely NOT kid friendly.   A very bad experience 3 yrs ago with one of the owners was so bad that it caused us not to set foot in the store again.  If you have kids, save your aggravation and don't bother going into the store. Fragile & glass items are set very low on the shelves and easily accessible from a stroller.   The store is so tight that you will have a hard time keeping your stroller or kids away from the items. If there are other people in the store, you will have no choice but to move closer to the shelves which becomes too temping for kids no to want to touch something....  And if your kids do touch something, you may get a scolding from an owner by reminding you that  items on the shelves are fragile and can break. Seriously, anyone telling me that a glass bottle or jar can break is just being rude... we get it... duh,  glass can break!  Maybe if glass items were not 2 ft off the floor, it wouldn't be such a big deal.  Unfortunately our experience is not isolated. We have friends who experienced the same thing at Formagination.     So take this review into consideration - if you are with young children and are coming from the toy store just a few doors down, think again about walking into this store with them. You may just walk right back out and thinking to yourself, is this store really worth the hassle?  You may just find yourself going back to a local grocery store, co-op or cheese factory store for your cheese needs."}
{"text":"Before I even walked in, I knew I was in heaven. Cheese glorious cheese!  Fromagination has a great selection of cheeses that you won't find anywhere else (like the limited supply of cave-aged goat cheese with ash brought in that day from a local cheesemaker!). They'll let you taste any cheese before you buy and there are plenty of samples around the store. They have a nice selection of jams and crackers as well (they sell Potter's crackers, which are amazing).  Expect to spend a little more than you would on cheese from a grocery store, but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"What a great little cheese shop. Selection and service were great. I'm surprised I'm not finding places like this all over Wisconsin.   Parking and location are both a bit lacking. It's worth the trip. Make sure you have meter money. Maybe they'll open a shop in Middleton."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this cheese shop while walking around Madison. What a find! A true cheese shop with a great selection of local cheeses. Helpful staff. I purchased three cheeses."}
{"text":"This cheese store was delightful!  Conveniently located right next to my hotel, it was a great place to wander around at the epicurean delights.  I wanted to take everything home with me, and after careful consideration, adopted several of the 'cheese orphans' that hang out in front of the cash register as the small pieces leftover from the larger blocks of cheese.  They've got them sorted into 'Wisconsin' and 'non-Wisconsin' so that you can decide if you want to stick to locals or not.  It was a great choice for a little cheese tasting party of my very own, many, many miles away.  They've also got some mad-delicious looking sandwiches."}
{"text":"Nice little cheese shop with a variety of fine cheeses, knick-knacks from local artists and spirits.  Great stop for last minute tourist souvenirs. Staff was knowledgeable and welcoming."}
{"text":"Walking into Fromagination is realizing that heaven does exist, and it is in a small cheese shop.  Located on the capitol square in down-town Madison, Fromagination is a cannot-be-missed destination for cheese lovers.  They have a wide array of delicious cheeses from Wisconsin and around the world, and samples are always available.  Additionally, they sell other specialty food items such as chocolate, oils, crackers, specialty meats; everything you'd need for a summer picnic or cheese tasting party.    What I don't think most people know at first about this place is that they also have fresh made sandwiches available that utilize one of their decadent cheese selections.  On a nice spring or summer day, having one of their sandwiches on their outdoor patio makes for a satisfying lunch experience."}
{"text":"Fromagination is a magical place.  Sure, you could buy your cheeses at the grocery store, but grocery stores don't smell nearly as fantastic.  And no grocery store ever has as many samples, or as large an orphan selection.  I try to take out of town guests to Fromagination early in the visit to stock up on snacking cheeses.  Guests frequently insist on return visits, on which I am more than happy to oblige & accompany!  I find it hard to not buy at least one of the cheeses available for sampling (so good marketing, guys), as well as a few old standards (Oh, Hooks 12 year, I love you).  The orphan basket near the register is also awesome-- tiny cuttings of cheese to increase variety on your cheeseboard without leftovers!  Service is obviously a little more focused if you hit the shop when it isn't packed.  I haven't figured out a reliable pattern for this yet, but if you're patient when they are busy, the cheesemongers will eventually help you find a cheese or twelve you'll enjoy. If they're not busy, samples are encouraged, as well as a drink while browsing.  Fromagination also stocks a wide variety of \"cheese companions\", ranging from local crackers, meats and truffles, fancy jams & honeys, to Wisconsin craft beers.  I also tend to lust over the cheese serving accoutrements when I'm there, although my current strategy of cheese on cutting board with index card labels will satisfy my serving needs for now."}
{"text":"Fromag-i-whaaat? My sister, a Madison local, was telling me about one of her favorite shops along the square. I listened to her praise their service, selection, and overall cheesiness.  I was unaware such a place existed. But, I should have known better. After all, this IS Wisconsin we're talking about! Beer and cheese flow through the veins of most Wisconsites. And how can you blame them? Cheese is a wonderful thing. It takes careful crafting, loads of patience, and sometimes an artistic and creative vision.   She took me through this small, yet jam packed store on a weekday afternoon. The samples were plentiful, but the service was not. Understandably so, since it was during the summer and there were several concert-on-the-square folks milling about.   You could tell the people behind the counter were well versed in their fromage. And for the lucky few that received help, it was apparent that their knowledge was extensive.  Fromagination is a wonderful store that I could easily overspend in...if I ever got service...."}
{"text":"CHEEESE!!! So much delicious cheese and so many toppings to eat it with and so many samples to taste before you buy. This is an impeccably designed and executed store. Service is friendly and accommodating of many questions. Everything tastes good. A bit pricey, though, so be warned."}
{"text":"awesome knowledgeable staff that makes you feel at home here. Tried many local and imported cheeses and chose some awesome cheese with  espresso rind. Even grabbed a rare and delicious New Glarus Raspberry Tart Bomber here."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit for cheese lovers!! They have variety of cheese that you won't probably find anywhere else. They also keep locally made fruit preserves and ciders...you must give them a try! Kristi was so helpful in suggesting us cheeses that we'd love based on our preference... And oh so patiently she would have us taste all of them we wanted and think and decide which one we wanted to go for... the best part is, they ship countrywide and I'm definitely ordering something soon!!"}
{"text":"After exploring the farmers market last weekend, I decided to hop into Fromagination as I have seen it featured on Wisconsin Foodie, and whom doesn't love cheese and local made products?  The cheese that was sitting out to try was very good and I even bought a package of it along with a stick of salami. The store has a very good selection of cheeses and the workers I encountered were friendly and knowledgeable.   This will be my go to cheese shop."}
{"text":"Great cheeses and snack items.  Staff were wonderful!  This is a must for anyone visiting as well as locals looking for quality foods."}
{"text":"Love the little orphans. Great way to taste various cheese for cheap!"}
{"text":"What a cool shop with such helpful workers!   I went in to get a specific cheese. There's so much cheese in the counters that I just asked for what I wanted instead of looking for it. I was the only one in the shop so I could have plenty of assistance.   They had the one cheese that I wanted and then since it was for a gift I asked the worker to select a couple other similar cheeses for me to add to the gift basket I was going to make. She picked out two more and let me choose how much I wanted. I ended up getting 1 lb. of one blue cheese and .5lbs of two other blue cheeses for about $40. They also gave me a $9 lunch bag to help me get them home unmelted and gave me an ice pack!   In addition to the cheese to go they have a small sandwich menu and sell other things that go with wine - serving and gift items. They also give free samples - both those set out on the counter and of anything in the cases you might want to try.   I liked that the workers either had to or did come around from behind the counter to get the cheese out. The counter cases open out into the store from the front. This is great in my opinion as it puts the staff next to you and the implication is just to be more helpful. If I lived here this is just the kind of shop I would love to frequent and become well known at."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It is a bit pricy, but they will let you taste basically anything you want and the cheese will never disappoint you. The staff are cheeses experts and always ready to help you select exactly what you want. I can never resist going in there when I walk by! Great for all types of cheeses especially exotic and interesting ones."}
{"text":"What a cute find!  All kinds of good cheeses from Wisconsin and other places. Bought a couple to take home for Christmas brunch. Store was cute and smelled good inside. Lots of different cheeses to try. Store was decorated well and lots of other trinkets for sale. Will definitely come back here to try other cheeses."}
{"text":"If they ever decided to rename this place my vote would be Cheese Paradise.    The vintage deli cases are filled to the absolute brim with fantastic wedges of some of the best cheese from Wisconsin and the world.  Round wheels of delight are stacked in every inch of space in this storefront on the Capitol Square.  And somewhere they happen to find space for gourmet oils and salts, chocolates and crackers and a small selection of higher end wines and spirits.  There are also samples, and lots of them.  Satori Cheese is one of my favorite WI makers and I was happy to taste their Pastorale Blend Sheep and Cow's milk cheese.  It was sweet , then cool and finished a bit smoky, largely because it's hand dusted with a robust Hungarian Paprika.  After snapping out of about 15 minutes of vacillating between sensory overload and pure cheese bliss, my senses were tempted by a large upcycled whiskey barrel full of cheese orphans.  If you're new to the concept an orphan is the little block of cheese that's left after most of the wheel has been sold.  It's too small to accurately depict the visual beauty of a wedge or a wheel.   So it's wrapped tightly in cheese paper, and marked as an orphan, or as they are known in my world - the perfect opportunity to create a small (or sometimes singular) tasting party!  And Fromagination has more orphans in more varieties than most stores.  On this particular visit I found a home for:  Pecarino Romano - Made in Tuscany,  Italy from 100% sheep\"s milk, it's a very hard cheese that crumbles or shreds with a deep nutty flavor.  Red Rock Cheddar Blue Blend from Roelli Cheese Haus in Roelli, WI - It's a natural rind, sharp cheddar with a blue vein that's cave aged for 60 days and made with cow's milk for a creamy, mild cheddar flavor laced with a pop of blue.  Hook's Five Year Aged Cheddar -  This Mineral Point, WI cheese factory has been crafting some fantastic pure and blended cheeses for over 30 years,.   And if you haven't had their aged cheddars, you haven't lived.  The longer a cheddar is cave aged, the deeper and more complex the flavors.  A well aged 20 year cheddar can sell for over $50 per pound.  So this Five Year is a nice compromise with and extra sharp full flavor.  Beenleigh Sheep Milk Blue - I've always been a fan of sheep's milk cheese.  They tend to be creamier and hold deeper flavors than cow's or even goat's cheese.  This particular blue is from the Devon Region of England and melts on your palate to reveal a strong blue with subtle spicy undertones.  If you have a cheese list this is the place to go.  If you want to try new cheeses this is the place to go.  And if you've never had great cheese, this is the place to go.  Basically, if you like cheese, this is the place to go, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"A really delightful shop featuring not only a great selection of cheese, but also tons of chocolates, jams, and gifts. The true highlight- the sandwiches! The Great Wisconsin sandwich is big enough for two people and absolutely delicious. The staff is really friendly too, offering me a Yerba mate tea right when I walked in."}
{"text":"I have to say, this place rocks! I love how far Madison has come since my days of high school. We wandered around the square to see what had developed since the days of yore, and found the hotel that is the site of a famous mothers day blow out (sorry ma, we gotta go back home, no time to stop by, oh, btw, happy mothers day...) and then saw....what is this? Heaven on earth. Sure 19 bucks for 3 oz of toffee is a bit much, but they had it out to sample, so I ate maybe 4 bucks worth. Then we got their grab and go section of pre made sandwiches.  Olive paste, some cheese and salami on a baguette!  With chips and gherkin and mustard and a bit of chocolate to compliment my meal. And a Capital Brew.   Gawd darn I could use one of these experts w/in walkin distance of my abode! (lunch for 2 was only 13 bucks)."}
{"text":"Came to this place on my way back from a walk to the hotel. I love cheese, so I came in (thought the name was super cute).   Guess what they had? FREE SAMPLES! I'm a sucker for free samples, man. I tried almost everything. Fell in love with one particular:  Black Pepper BellaVitano from Sartori Cheese. GET THIS!  Finally I decided to order a sandwich. I ordered the fig and cheese sandwich. It was $7. OK, I don't mind paying more for good cheese. The manager, I think, rang me up. He swiped my card once, paper came out, he said he did it wrong. He swiped it again. Had me sign. I left.  A few months later, I balanced my checkbook (what? Like you're ontime with it?). They charged me twice.  I took the issue to Twitter and they responded! They said just to email ken@fromagination.com and let him know. Yeah, I did. It's three months later. No response.   I have taken it back to Twitter with...yep! No response. I'm not a happy customer. $14 for a freakin' sandwich. Ugh! Bitter much? Yes.  So, they get two stars. I should give one, but the cheese was free and good. I can't deny that. I want to, but that wouldn't be fair. Well, it wasn't all that free I guess. It cost me an extra $7. Bastards."}
{"text":"Great little shop. They go out of their way to feature cheese from Wisconsin, yet their selection is from all over. The quality of their layout and decor (they even have cable-controlled ceiling fans) is something you only see in Manhattan, not even Chicago. Outstanding customer service, unoutrageous prices, really excellent, top-notch goods. But not at all elitist. Also got a party tray from them and it was outstanding and beautifully prepared. Plus you can eat outside or in the shop in winter."}
{"text":"Lovely staff, welcomed us into the store offering wine or water along with a myriad of cheese samples. We savored the underground saucisson salami, a rich and rustic aged meat tube made locally. 2 cheeses called our names, the roelli/laclare jack blue, a meritage born of two separate cheese makers, and the bellavitano merlot washed cheese. We enjoyed all three outside on the capital square. The selection at fromagination was a fine collection of the outstanding local and international cheeses, meats, chocolates, oils and so much more. Great place to find a hostess or other gift, or lunch like we did. Cheeses were well cared for and rivalled any of our san francisco cheese haunts. Lucky madison locals, no wonder you're called cheese heads!"}
{"text":"This is a fun cheese and sandwich shop! Their small outdoor seating area has a great view of the Capitol. They also have a lot of cheese/hosting knick-knacks for sale if you are looking for serving plates or cheese knives or little gifts etc.   We got there around 4PM on a Saturday - they close pretty early at 5PM so the Sandwich we got had already been made and packaged. Closer to close they do not make sandwiches to order. Our sandwich was still really tasty and we shared it. It had turkey and cranberry spread.   We split the sandwich on the patio, I tried a Wisconsin Craft Beer by One Barrel Brewing and then we went back in and bought the Speck Prosciutto (1/4 lb) and some delicious cheese. We took this back out to the patio and feasted some more. Expansive selection of cheeses here, though I don't think I saw anything super crazy (like the Alp Blossom! My new fav cheese). They did carry Red Rock which is a cheddar blue I have been seeing at farmer's markets/cheese shops in Chicago, so that was cool."}
{"text":"Sweet dreams are made of Cheese.  I am absolutely obsessed with this place.  You walk into a heaven.  Was visiting family and knew I had to stop by and get some delicious local cheeses.  Walked in and was welcomed with big smiles.  They handed us some hot cider to drink while we looked around.  5 stars alone for the knowledge of the workers.  The young guy behind the counter knew everything and anything there was to know about cheeses.  I felt like I was getting schooled in cheese 101.  He gave us loads of tastings and recommended pairings for us.  We ended buying 6: Red Rock -aged cheddar, Bleu Mont Dairy, cave aged chandoka -Cow & Goat Mix(award winning), GranQueso, pleasant ridge reserve - best of show, Little Boy Blue.  They are all beyond some of the best cheeses I have ever tasted in my life.  Note: They will cut whatever size you want so don't worry about that.  Not only do they sell cheese, they sell fruits, honey, nuts, dishes, and anything else you could possibly need for a perfect charcuterie platter.  I would never go to Wisconsin and not stop here.  I'll leave you with my one cheese joke:  What music does cheese listen to?         R & Brie........"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of specialty WI cheeses. I got the WI cheese sampler plate, cow version. Perfect balance of cheese and accompaniments. Nice selection of beer available as well."}
{"text":"This shop is, hands down, the best cheese shop and gift store for all your foodie needs!  Just used their gift shipping service to send some cheese to a dear friend...they are so helpful.  Not only is this a killer retail store but their sandwiches are what dreams are made of.  If you're in town and want to experience and taste all of the great cheesy things Wisconsin has to offer...come here (on an empty stomach)!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome shop right off the square in downtown Madison. The boutique area is filled with gifts ranging from cheese and meat board accompaniments, to books on mindfulness and gardening tools. The actual Cheesemonger are well-informed and friendly, always willing to give tastes! I wasn't able to eat here but would be interested in the raclette lunch."}
{"text":"I must be part rat because I LOVE me some cheese.  Grilled cheese, mac'n'cheese, grits with cheese, cheese sand, cheese on a burger, cheese fries, veggie chili and wit cheese, on a salad, with apples, with carrot slices, spinach and CHEESE dip, cream cheese, hard, soft or fumy cheese, on a taco, as a snack, on a charcuterie platter, cheese melted on top of veggies, did someone say fondue, omelet, stuffed bell pepper, casserole, shepherds pie, rito, eggs and cheese croissant, fried, died or laid to the side I am your girl.  That said I think you get the gest.  So when my sis-n-law said she wanted to take us to this cheese shop I was ON BOARD!  This place is located right around the Capitol so parking can be a premium at times.  Once parked we walked in and BAM I was hit was the WONDERFUL SMALL of cheese.  This shop is JAM PACKED with all things cheese and accoutrements that have to do with cheese.  Its a bit of a one stop shop and you can even get a sand made for lunch.  If that does not float your boat you can put together a little picnic because they sale everything from olives, mini pickles, fresh sliced meats, crackers, jams, chocolates etc., including all the knives to cut or spread the cheese and jams.    They also have cutting boards, decorative items, some bottled beers, wines and non-alcoholic drinks as well, and things of that nature, as well as, gift sets for people.  IT'S AMAZING!  I LOST MY MIND in this shop.   A HUGE VARIETY of cheese is GREAT and they will let you try a selection before buying.  We ended up getting a little of this and that to take back with us to the house.  Wisconsin cheeses as well as of country cheeses to delight your senses.  There is a high probability you WILL FIND SOMETHING you like.    Being one of the ONLY cheese shops in the area they get a lot of business.  This is a definite MUST STOP for cheese lovers or even if you just want a NICE FRESH sand for lunch."}
{"text":"Compare to Zingerman's in Ann Arbor - and these guys get blown away.  The markup is like 50-80% above what you can pay elsewhere. Bought a hunk of young Gouda and when we unwrapped it it was moldy and mostly rind - and we paid $50/lb and I see online other shops selling the same cheese for about $30.  I did not buy a Yahara Bay apple brandy for $80 which I later saw online for forty something.  They have nice stuff- but they seem to not be delivering the best value."}
{"text":"Mmmm, cheese! They have a pretty good variety of cheeses, but, I've seen a lot of the same cheeses at Woodman's, and for WAY less.  However, it is pretty cool to be able to sample the cheese before you buy it. They sell a lot of Dean & DeLuca stuff there, so that kinda gives you an idea of the prices. The employees are very helpful, and friendly."}
