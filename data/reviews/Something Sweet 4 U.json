{"text":"DO NOT go here. I ordered a cake here and when I picked it up they made the wrong cake! It was covered in icing so I couldn't tell until I cut it open. When I called them to ask about it, I was told that since the value of the cake I got was the same price as the one I ordered, they wouldn't do anything?!?!?!? I would give them a negative if I could.  I looked around online afterwards and they did the exact same thing to some one else! Do NOT go here. They are terrible!"}
{"text":"My parents are well-versed when it comes to Filipino food in the Mississauga area. I came home one Sunday for our weekly Sunday family dinner and my dad told me about a new place called Something Sweet 4 U. I thought the name was a little strange at first, given that he didn't order desserts or anything sweet, but once I tried the food I could see what he was so excited about.  The food here is consistently outstanding and is always excellent quality. There are two locations: one on Rathburn Road, an unassuming little spot in a strip plaza; the second on Bristol and Terry Fox Way, which is a little larger and is much newer. Both locations are of the same quality, although you will notice the chefs at each location have a different style. Also, the offerings at each location are not always the same.   Both locations serve food the same way most Filipino 'restaurants' do: cafeteria style. I wouldn't go as far as calling Something Sweet a restaurant actually because there is no seating area. There are a couple of tables at the Bristol location, but there is rarely any room to actually sit down. The Rathburn location barely has room to form a line.  I've tried virtually everything they offer, my favourites being: binagoongan, caldereta, lechon paksiw, pancit palabok, lumpia shanghai, kare-kare and ukoy. Honestly though, there is nothing there that I don't like. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, being a Filipino and all, but there were some dishes I didn't even know about that I ended up really enjoying. Also, I almost ALWAYS order a crapload of turon. I love it (they're 60 cents a piece).  The servers are always very friendly. I've gone when it was incredibly busy and I never had to wait very long. Like most places, they will tend to run out of food towards the end of the day. It's hard to complain about that but it's just a function of the 'cafeteria' style restaurant.   Price-wise I think Something Sweet is on the same level as all other Filipino places I've been to. Whenever I crave home cooking, or am too lazy to make meals on my own, this is the first place I visit when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Some good food items and some not so good.  Veg crepe was cheap at $2.50 and pretty tasty.  Skewers were yummy but not even Luke warm.  :/ that's kind of bad.  Noodles were good.  Breakfast special was nice for $7.50.  Halo drink was pricey at $6 and not tasty, rather bland.  Tables were really dirty and nobody was cleaning them.  Unappetizing.  I had to clear my own table and wipe it down before sitting.  Crazy long lineup so I guess that's a good thing."}
{"text":"3 star rating just for food . As soon as you walk in its a state of confusion no one sure who's taking your order . I could not find a menu and stood there for 25 min waiting on spring rolls . I did see some good food being served . Also noticed some customers complaning about there food.  Unless you know  what your getting don't even bother .  Or just order pork spring rolls like me they are good and cheap ."}
{"text":"Typical over price filipino restaurant...   Their barso de mercedes seems old, and most of the Filipino dish were pork."}
{"text":"We eat here almost 2x a month . Delicious breakfast . Friendly staff. Very authentic ! Feels like home !"}
{"text":"Before, their sizzling sisig was bomb! With juicy pieces of pork with chicharon and egg. Now, their sisig seem made from pork ledlftover from other dishes since it was so dry. The little mayo-esque frugally drizzled on top failed to give the dish any flavor. To finish this not so great experience, their additional cup of rice was barely a cup and cost 2.50. This would be last time eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't bother wasting your time here. The only reason I go here is because they are the closest Filipino store in my area. However, if you want my two cents, this place is not worth it AT ALL. Their food isn't that great. I know a place in Dixie Park that just opened and they are way cheaper and the food tastes better too. Really reminds me of home-cooked food. This place however, has shitty  food. The sinigang is too oily. The rice is either too sticky or isn't cooked properly. And you can tell some of the food is not made fresh at all.   I went there today because I was craving sinigang and when I was about to order up, the lady with an overtly bleached face said it wasn't part of the combo. What the eff? She could have told me beforehand seeing as it was not like that before. You're telling me that now I have to pay extra for oily sinigang (which should never be oily AT ALL) with a couple of meat in it? They fill you up with soup and not actual meat or veggies. No thanks. Never coming back here at all. Would rather go to dixie park even if it's far... at least it's good homemade food and they don't cheap you out on meat either."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great for filipino families because there's plenty of seating.  The food is a bit pricey, but the service is awesome, and so is the plating.  It's pretty clean and there's plenty of options on the menu.  You can also purchase items for take home such as small snacks and sweets.   I especially love the cashier / server Monica! She's so adorable and sweet!"}
{"text":"Very good Filipino resto with very reasonable price. Famous Silog breakfast is available. Very friendly customer service. Braso de mercedes, boat tart, and many more!! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I've had better filipino food. I ordered the garlic fried rice with dinuguan, chicken afritada and sago to drink.   The food was disappointing. It was warm and not hot and lacked in flavour. I had to put salt and pepper in everything.  The sago was the only thing that was good here.   The place itself is very spacious and very clean. Love the colours and how everything is set up. Wishing I loved the food just as much as the space itself."}
{"text":"Okay, Mississauga is so multicultural yet I really only see chain restos, Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants and some Middle Eastern restaurants.  Yet there are very few Filipino restaurants even though there is a huge Filipino population.  This place opened up in the Heartland Town Centre food area (i.e. Britannia and Latimer Road).    Decor: 3/5 - very clean and modern  Service: 2.5/5 - I came here during it's first week and there were a few kinks, which almost had me running out the door.  While the cashier was very friendly, I was very apprehensive when I saw someone cleaning the place with a mop at around 5:30 pm.  I figure most cleaning should be done at around 2-4 pm, when it's not prime eating time.  The second thing was that when I ordered a combo, it took the cashier a while to figure out why their POS (point of sale) device wasn't sending the order to the kitchen.  She then had to be told since it was a \"combo\", there's no need.  Despite these two hiccups (which would scare me off if it were a long standing establishment), the cashier was very helpful in explaining what everything was.   Food: 3.5/5 - okay I don't remember what I ordered.  I believe it was chicken and pork adobo and some type of pork \"sausage\" with rice.  The adobo tasted like a sweet curry chicken, which I thought was okay.  However, I really loved the pork \"sausage\".  I wish I could describe or compare it to something, but I can't.  It was a good mix of sweet and salty. In addition, the rice was very fragrant.   Verdict:  It's very different than Chinese, Thai, and Indian food.  It's not spicy.  But it has similar curries but sweet.  Try it out.  Seems like it's good for takeout and would be great hangover food too."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is disgusting. Bought palabok and they filled it up 2/3rd of the way. I ordered kikiam and second bite in, I wanted to puke. I spit it out. My mouth is still suffering from the salt.  Super salty. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This location is the best location if you want entrees.  The locations in Mississauga have iffy food- had the saltiest kikiam - actually the saltiest of any food in my life there. Could have been a one-off, but quality control people! The heartland location has a smaller menu and is more focused on desserts. This location has a full menu, and the food has been okay so far. I like their palabok here as they put more \"laman\" or toppings than it's other locations.  As with any takeout filipino place, I find they are so careful and stingy in filling up the box, if it looks like it's probably two to three more scoops for it to be full, they stop. Anyway, their staff is not knowledgeable, I ordered a dinuguan which is pork blood stew and when I went home and ate it, it was adobo that looked like dinuguan. Or so I think, maybe that really was dinuguan cooked in a very weird way. This place is ok, I may go back."}
{"text":"Building on what Bernie mentioned in his review, I'm amazed at the lack of Filipino food options in Mississauga given its high Philippine population.   When I was younger, I would frequently visit Something Sweet 4 U's other locations to get small baked goods in bulk, such as their mouth-watering empanadas. They've now progressed and opened a full-scale restaurant in a strip-mall plaza littered with other food options such as Wild Wing, California Sandwiches, and Marble Slab Bakery.   It goes without question that the restaurant is popular among the Filipino population, but to be truly successful, the word has to spread a lot further. Why do I believe that this won't be a problem in the years to come? Because their food is good. Really good.   My first visit to the restaurant was at 9:00am - I was craving a traditional Filipino breakfast. Their breakfast offerings consist of a variety of dishes that end in \"-silog\". This is a portmanteau of sinangag (garlic fried rice) and itlog (fried egg). So basically, the way it works is you pick your meat to go with your combination of fried rice and egg. All of these breakfast combos are priced at $6.50.   I had the daingsilog, which consists of daing (milkfish), sinangag, and itlog. I was highly impressed with the presentation of the dish (check out my pictures to see what I mean). The food was very good - pretty much exactly what I expected. Daing was nice and soft with a crisp outer shell, just the way I like it. Portion size was also great for a breakfast combo.   If I had one gripe about my experience, it would be that their bottled waters are frozen and barely drinkable. Nothing terrible, but just a small gripe.   I still wait for the day that Mississauga can boast higher quality Filipino offerings akin to Lamesa downtown and Casa Manila in the northeastern GTA. Something Sweet 4 U's newest location doesn't fit that criteria, but it shows that Filipino food in Mississauga is headed in the right direction."}
{"text":"Ok so first off, don't come here if you are indecisive and have trouble making decisions under pressure. It's a very small space and the ready-made food trays are not labelled. Additionally, the lady behind the counter was not helpful in describing each dish or making recommendations (she ran through each dish at lightening speed, with no explanations, which made it difficult for a newbie to the cuisine). Fortunately, I had dropped by shortly after they opened, so I was able to take my time to decide.  There were actually lots of things that interested me but it was either $7 for 1 item or $8.50 for a 2-item combo (with rice, no drink, taxes in) so I went with the latter. There was a classic adobo (basically the only thing I recognized) and a stewed pork liver that piqued my interest, but in the end I went with 'pork steak' and Bicol express. The pork steak was a bit dry but very tender. It's a soy-based super savoury marinade and a tiny bit sweet. I really liked it. The onions that were stewed in the sauce were especially flavourful- sweet and soft. The Bicol express was also tasty- the pork cubes were cooked just right, not over cooked (I think from a pork shoulder cut), and bathed in a mildly spicy coconut sauce (using jalapeños). It reminded me a bit of a Thai green curry. The rice was unevenly cooked, some grains perfect and others mushy, but it was doled out from a big rice cooker so that was kind of to be expected.   There was a fried milkfish that looked delicious but it wasn't part of the combo. I think they had prices for individual items written on takeout containers. I feel like this is what homemade casual comfort Philippino cooking would taste like. They accept cash and debit (don't think credit though). I thought it was tasty for what it was and would come back to try other items."}
{"text":"I was raised on Filipino food and I must say this place is as good as my Grandma's cooking was!"}
{"text":"I'm half Filipino, but I live 4 hours away from my mom and I don't cook so I am always craving some good Filipino food.  The food was only okay.  They didn't have any signs on any of the dishes, so I didn't really know what the food was, so I just ordered what looked like some kind of lechon.    I did buy some ensamada from the bakery that had ube in the middle.  It was some of the best ensamada I've ever had!  I brought it to a potluck I went to and people drooled over it."}
{"text":"The best Filipino dish joint in Mississauga. If you're looking for an all day Filipino breakfast this is the place. Friendly staff, good food, lots of selection, clean restaurant and prices are fair. Look to taste the Kwek Kwek. It's their take on this famous street food in Manila. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came right after typical lunch time but also it was during a Tuesday of March Break. There were some people there, a few families, a group of construction workers, and a few mama types just hanging around.  the place is a lot more modern than some Filipino restaurants I've been too in terms of design... Let's call it ikea chic with shades of eggplant on the walls.   I was craving some traditional filipino breakfast and this time I got a tocinolog (rice, egg, and sweet pork) it came with Achara (I'd say it's Filipino sauerkraut but it's on the more sweet vs sour side).  I added a halo-halo drink to it...   The food was good, I was filled and had to force down the last bit but only cuz it was so yummy and I was taught to never leave food on a plate.  I find it odd that the halo halo cost almost as much as a the main meal but the drink was ok... Compared to quiapo quiapo though, even though it was cheaper, the quiapo version was a lot yummier"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake from here. It looked really nice but it was not very tasty. It was supposed to be vanilla but it was not sweet at all. The service was good and the staff is friendly, but that cake really disappointed my mum and me."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best in Brampton. Their prices seem reasonable to me in comparison to many others in the area and I find them friendly (particularly the younger lady that's very well spoken).  They've got great dessert and I really like the taste of their ulam's (dishes).  Try them out!"}
{"text":"The only Filipino restaurant in Mississauga where you could sit in without smelling like \"ulam\" when you leave. Place is clean. Friendly staff. Price is reasonable. They can be very busy and sometimes they ran out- good for them, but as a customer, call ahead esp if you plan to come in near the closing time.  Their TerryFox location is better- more food options but limited seating. TerryFox is only good for takeouts."}
{"text":"This place has the ingredients to become the go-to sit-down spot for Filipino food in Mississauga. It's clean, has ample seating, classy decor, and a wide range of options on the menu. It's a great spot to take your parents for lunch on a Sunday (which I did), and you wouldn't be the only one - the place was packed on a Sunday around 12:30 PM.  Unfortunately, a couple of things are lacking. First, there doesn't seem to be any crowd-control mechanisms in place to control the lineups that form at lunchtime. While my parents and I came just in the nick of time and grabbed a table before the crowds started arriving, it doesn't seem like anyone is really around to inform incoming guests that it's an X minute wait for a table, nor is there really a place to stand wait, so people are left walking around and standing beside your table, hovering, watching you eat, and waiting for you to finish up. Secondly, their Halo-Halo (dessert) was a 1 star. I pretty much paid almost $7 for ice. Very minimal toppings, zero sweetness, and the toppings that did come with it were hard and frozen.  The food itself was delicious (beef tapa was fresh, perfectly marinated and crispy, just the way I like it! Fried Food is my middle name). Although, for the price, at almost $8 per plate, portion size was very, very small. Aside from that, the food was great.   Overall, if they could work on their desserts and their restaurant logistics, and you don't mind the price point, these improvements could really make them a decent go-to sit-down restaurant for Filipino food in the west end."}
{"text":"This Filipino store tucked in a small plaza in Rathburn is an amazing find inside of Mississauga. A small place just strictly for take out. The staff are friendly and quick, although it looks rundown the food is as fresh as it'll get.  They serve traditional Filipino food like Kare-kare, bopis, fried fish, puto, hopia, etc. I will advise that people go there early due to shortage of food and people ordering an excessive amount that they just run out.  I will definitely recommend this store since its simy just so good. Second to the typical home cooking :). Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"my #1 spot for all-day filipino breakfast.  interesting purple decor (ube-themed?).  friendly staff.  i've tried some of their entree dishes, which are okay, and some of their desserts and baked items, which are good, but they absolutely excel at breakfast.  they serve -silog breakfast, which is a plate of atchara (pickled julienned papaya) with diced cucumbers and tomatoes, heavenly garlic-heavy fried rice topped with two fried eggs, and your choice of protein: sweet sausage, sweet pork, jerky-like beef, milkfish, etc.  the sweet pork (tocino) is my personal favourite, but i've tried most of the other proteins and they're just as good.  to top it all off, the plating is quite nicely done for these dishes.  the portions are perfect and totally worth the $7.50 price tag.  you can add coffee to your breakfast dish for just $0.75 too, and it's a really flavourful brew that doesn't have much acidity in the aftertaste.  please eat here"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch along with my wife and parents on a Sunday. The long lineups and poor logistics really take away from the whole experience. The food was good and tasteful but be prepared to wait and don't come here with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Im glad I found a place in Mississauga that serves delicious Filipino food! Greeted by many smiles, this location is take-out only. I ordered a one item combo (kare-kare and rice) for $6.50, and the portion was quite filling and tasty. I was craving turon, but unfortunately, they had sold out for the day. I'll be back; hopefully they will have turon then!"}
{"text":"I love binagoongan. Pork, braised with shrimp paste and other Filipino flavours, sometimes with vegetables. I crave for the salty sweet flavoring... true to their name, this was too sweet for me. Same with the dinuguan (pork cooked in pork blood). I appreciated the ginger flavour in the laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk), but not the huge pieces of ginger that got caught inside. Turon stood out the most, being covered in crispy sugary coating that was almost brûléed. Tone down on the sugar usage and you've got a keeper here!"}
{"text":"Their tapsilog is awesome!  The tapa was flavorful.... Sago gulaman is authentic according to my hubby (of course, to me, authentic means it's in a plastic pouch with straw in the streets.. lol).  The kids loved their Tocilog as well.  Fair amount of fat and meat."}
{"text":"I've only had desserts here and they're very delicious! Price is reasonable. I'd give them 5 stars but I haven't tried any of their \"ulam\" (side dish) yet. So 4 for now."}
{"text":"Well I don't kno much on Filipino food but one thing I know is it shouldn't be cold.  I got the beef stew with rice. Just not my type of dish with too much tendon and flavor was unsatisfying.  The warm cold food was a turn off.  Also had a banana spring roll which wasn't so bad.  Tho I wouldn't have it on my own.  I'd love to hear what's good here or in general for Filipino food BC mine was an extreme miss."}
{"text":"I came out here based on my co workers recommendation, located in heartland mall area its a select food cash out and wait for it to dropped on your table similar to Paramound restaurant. I ordered tupsilog $7.50 chicken Mami soup $6.50 halo halo $6.00 Sugo $2.50 and 1 bbq stick for $2  As i waited for my food, i ate the bbq stick and it was really cold they should heat it up before they serve it.  The Tupsilog was okay the mear was over cooked felt like i was chewing on beef jerky. The quantity of the food was quite small for $7.50  Mami Chicken soup oddly wasnt dropped at my table i had to go to counter to get it.  It taste really bland required a lil more garlic.  Halo halo for $6 was quite over priced and it was okay but if theure charging that they should real ube and not ube ice cream.   Sugo was very tasty and was worth the $2.50 price point.  Overall ill probably come back here to try some other things seating is ample and the enviorment is nice.  Hoping they get their things on point and i can give them more Kudos.  This is a definite second visit in the coming month since its close to my work.  MABUHAY!!!"}
{"text":"going to keep this one short.  my garlic rice was dry, like stale dry.  The meat was cold when it was served to me, so not sure what the deal was with that. my meal in general lacked flavor.  The best part of my experience here, was the look of the place. it had the cutest and most modern decoration I have ever seen in any Filipino restaurant, but other than that, I won't be back unless I hear there food is better."}
{"text":"2 stars is being generous. First they need to fix their timing. It says 8pm on their website but they close at 7.  Small place where a small group and eat.   I ordered ordered take out: palabok. It did not taste good at all.   My mom came here 3 times. All times the order was palabok. 1st time it was really delicious.  The 2 other times it was bad (missing ingredients). She says it's a shame coz the original place in sauga is a lot better (and that the original chef is there).   I don't think I'll be back here anymore (same goes for my mom)."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer of Somethin' Sweet.  (Just coz' its that one Filipino restaurant that in the centre/heart of Mississauga)   I would say that their dishes are okay. Sizzling sisig was not listed on their menu but they have it if you order it. Good for 2-3 serving ($11+tax). But can get a bit dry.  Their 'all day breakfast' menu is fair. I always order tapsilog and its a fair serving. But for $7.50? + tax? Other filipino restaurant like LunchBox in Brampton has more serving and tastes better for $5.50.  Empanadas & halo-halo are subpar.   However.. I LOVE THEIR KWEK-KWEK (quail eggs coated with sweet & sour sauce). Costs $3 for 6pcs."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that this place opened up so close to home and I no longer have to go to Mississauga or wait for family get together to get my fix. I'm a huge can of the Leche flan, beef stew and halo halo. I think the potion sizes could be a bit bigger but the prices are good so I can't complain."}
