{"text":"Was hanging with my boys in the Wynn and was looking for a great place close by that had decent food at decent prices.  I checked Yelp and Till's came up.  After finding the place behind a church we stopped in to check it out.  Nothing bigger than your standard hotel lounge, but was the perfect spot for a great burger or steak and all for under $14.  Multi TV screens showing different events and cheap beers.  Was truly a mirage in the middle of the desert and we will be sure to go again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this place because of groupon. Small hole In the wall inside a hotel.  It's hard to find, but you'll be glad you did. AMAZING burger!  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in vegas. Say hello to the chef Walter. Super nice guy!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, brand new bar, great food, great location, great prices, great bar tenders. What else can I say! I would 100% recommend this place. Wish they were open for lunch!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is amazing. I ordered a jalape√±o burger.  Everything tasted fresh. Staff super nice and fast service.  It's a little hole in the wall.  I stayed in Marriott next to this place and  bad o  other reviews I decided to give it a shot.  It is well worth money."}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas! Beer pong was fun and everyone made sure we were having an awesome time! Definitely coming back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Omgeeeeeee...we have been in Vegas for a week staying on the strip were each meal cost us $36+ and we had to spend our last night at blair house. They gave us 2 for 1 entree...and we would have paid in full without it...man this food and drinks are damn good...my hubby says its the best he's had all week for only a 3rd of the prices we've been paying. ..if your in Vegas...dine hear. ..good good. ..stiff drinks. ..good music...laid back vibe..."}
{"text":"This bar is in the Blair house suites hotel which was just remodeled, and they added this place just about 6-9 months ago. I must say that I did not expect much from this place, but the bartenders, food, and the video poker where all awesome, and all the flat screens weren't bad. Drinks were strong, food absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Soooooo my friend and I decided to try something new and get lunch and drinks off the strip!  Yea for new experiences!! Our server Meredith was so great!! So nice and fun to talk to and got great advice on Vegas deals!  We used our groupon with no trouble and even got a free shot(check in folks) The food was great and also at very great prices.  The drinks were around 3-7 dollars!! I can't wait to go back!! Candice was awesome too!!! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Our server Meredith was the BOMB!!!! The food was great, service was fast, and we had a blast. We will definitely return. Also, found out that you can rent the dining hall (which has a 55+\" TV for meetings/PowerPoint/presentations/etc). Such a great find!!!!! Y'all gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food the chef even came out to talk to us!  Candace the bartender was holding down the spot the whole time! Walter is an amazing chef!"}
{"text":"AWESOME burger and fries made by Chef Walter....Bartender Paige is AWESOME too, very friendly and great service too.  A MUST if you are in Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Great steak and fries with reasonable price. Also, I get a free shot by checking in. However, they only have a1 sauce but still ok to fill our hungry stomach"}
{"text":"My friends and I bought Groupons for beer pong. I called ahead to make sure we could use them. After redeeming two Groupons we were told the registers were closed and we couldn't redeem our third. No one told us they were closing. We would have gladly redeemed our third and tipped generously if we knew they were closing. Unfortunately we were left outside alone and the lights turned off and were not able to get what we paid for or to tip the bartenders that were nice to us. I will never come back."}
{"text":"The bartender on duty appeared to be managing both the bar area as well as the tables in the food area when we arrived. She was quick, efficient, and friendly. The food was good, and the quesadilla was surprisingly full of chicken and loaded with cheese. The drinks were also on point and the entire meal was very economical. We have also ordered the Pittsburg Steak Salad. It was large enough to be split between two people and very tasty.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. Love the food, the cold beer and Amanda the bartender. This place is a diamond in the rough. They possibly have the best burger in town at a great price. Ask for Walter the chef, great guy and always willing to satisfy."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and saw a few mixed reviews so wasnt sure but glad we gave it a chance.  Small pub in a small hotel......One of the best burgers I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Place in Vegas!  Cozy, quite, healthy food.  The only thing missing is Kombucha on tap.   Nice outdoor seating and welcoming staff make this my favorite place to take dates."}
{"text":"Found this place through the app, excellent reviews brought us to fulfill our burger cravings. Food and service were excellent! Burgers, fries, chicken strips were perfect and delicious. Walter the chef came out to check on us and was super cool! Will definitely come back during my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"After a rough night in Las Vegas walking the streets till 5 AM I didn't think I have anymore life this place could revitalize anybody spectacular food definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"We found this place on groupon. $14 for $30 and I would come back without the deal! Their burgers were so delicious! We came around noon so the place was empty, which worked out for us bc there was only one waitress/bartender. Definitely coming back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"It took us some effort to find this place because Desert Inn east of Las Vegas Blvd. S goes underground then resurfaces that the pedestrians have to walk through the parking lot of Guardian Angel Cathedral, right on to Channel 8 Drive to get to Rita Suites. The bar and restaurant is in the hotel/motel. Our newly hired lady server was very helpful and sweet. The grilled mahi mahi was very tender and tasty. The fries was dangerously superb yummy!"}
{"text":"This is my first review so id like to start off with that. The girls here are very sweet my favorite is bianca she cute af if you request a song theyll play it for you the service is fast so its great to come here before we go to any dayclub or night club bc they always have specials. Hope this helped you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, my partner, and I found this little gem a few blocks from (where we were staying) on the strip.   The service was terrific (both the bartender, and the chef, were really attentive); the ambiance was quaint; the prices were EXTREMELY reasonable; and finally the food was AMAZING.  I had the Meredith's Supreme Pizza, which was ENORMOUS, and so incredibly flavorful. It was so Delicious, I had to pack, what I couldn't finish, via airplane, back home (to California) to share with my daughter. She loved it, as much as I did.  My partner had the Till's 1/2 lb Burger, and Steak Fries. He raved about how succulent the burger was, and how well seasoned the fries were.  In conclusion, it was a REAL pleasure to dine at this little hidden treasure. And, I would suggest, should you happen to be in the vicinity, check them out!!"}
{"text":"Good food...convenient that its located on the Rita Suites Hotel where we stayed. The hotel gave us some credits towards food and drinks. We ordered two different types of pizza, salad, and Chicken Fingers. Food was fresh and tastey. Waitress was a sweetheart.  We are coming back later for drinks"}
{"text":"Great bar very good cook and bartender. Big beers only 5 bucks. Great wings. Lots of entertainment very friendly people. We had a good time drinking a few beers and eating wings. Hard to find but worth the extra look."}
{"text":"Stopped in in a Monday night at 9. No one there. The bartender warned me they were changing the menu and were out of a few items.   Well, the first one was orange juice, so that changed my drink selection. I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich, which was Cheez Whizzed, which I'm not used to since I'm now from the East coast where we usually use a white cheese. I also ordered it without mushrooms, which was good as that was one of the items they were out of too. The sandwich came with fries, some of which had a metallic taste-maybe freezer burn??  The food was very reasonably priced, so that was a plus!  Now the good news. Julie, the bartender was great. Friendly, and an intelligent conversationalist. Drink prices were reasonable so if you're looking for a good drink, stop in."}
{"text":"groupon brought me here and I am so thankful! This is a great place to eat and chill!  It is very close to the strip,  decent prices, and great staff! It is located inside The Rita's hotel is clean and not too loud: )  My chicken quesadilla and blue cheese burger were both tasty and made well!   Thanks!  Candace is my favorite bartender in life, you have a new regular!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing cocktail prepared by Meredith called cherry blossom made with berry ciroc. So bomb!!! And the grilled mahi mahi was out of this world, so fresh and no fishy taste at all. Kudos to the chef Walter!"}
{"text":"It's in a rundown hotel 1/2 block off the strip in a Smokey room that is 10x12 in size I would not even call in a restaurant or Bar"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Kandice the bar tender was super nice and welcoming, wish i lived in Vegas just to come here more often!   Me and my cousin had bacon cheeseburgers, fries, strawberry lemonade and a apple martini...  Everything was beyond what we expected, cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time here, enjoyed awesome service from Meredith who was our attendant for the evening. Food was awesome had the wings, chicken bbq pizza, steak salad, fries, onion rings and our stellas, redds, blue moon and long island ice tea. Food was delish, ambiance was nice, off the bar we dined in the dining room overlooking the courtyard patio with tables so dining was optional outside but in this Vegas heat it was a no lol. Will be coming here more often now!"}
{"text":"I found a deal for this place on Groupon. I can see how it can be hard to find. The actual hotel is not named \"The Blair\" (I forgot the actual name). The service and food were exceptional. The server recommended the burgers and rightfully so. Probably one of the best burgers you will eat. The only issue I had (which is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars) is that the hours of operation on YELP are misleading. I went on Saturday at 1pm as it was listed as being open only to be told that they didn't open until 3pm. I would call ahead of time to double check if you plan on going earlier in the afternoon. Aside from that, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon for 30$ worth of food and drinks for 15$ and thought we would give it a try. Weird spot, its in a condo/apartment buliding/motel, and it's like a normal hotel lobby bar but better. We got there at like 10 and they closed at 11... which is odd to close so early on a Saturday?!?! Anyway, bartender Trey was very cool and recommended the burger and said the pizzas were really small and not worth it. I really appreciate anybody who is honest and says when something sucks and is not just like \"well, everything is good here\". That's lazy to me. So my girl got the bbq burger and it was amazing! cheese steak I goy was ok, but I shoulda got the burger too! So Trey was friendly and down to earth so we'll be back to see him ;-) but we'd be there more if u stayed open later??? (wink hint ;-) wink hint)"}
{"text":"Great bar...awesome drinks!!! Great music!!! Merderith and Candy were really nice. Cool place!!!"}
{"text":"a bunch of us went to go check this place out after the last UNLV basketball game and boy did I need a drink after that one, but this place was fun and we had a good time after a bad loss so I did not not have to go to bet angry. Great Bar food and some stiff drinks saved a dreadful evening"}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem- Read a couple of Yelp reviews and decided that Tills was what I was looking for-a quiet place with no casino to relax, have a few beers, grab a burger and watch a football game. Winner winner chicken dinner. Apps were great, had the absolute best burger ever.... Blue cheese burger, cooked perfect with crispy edges and terrific fries. The servers, Katie and Candice, were awesome and we enjoyed ourselves so much went back the next night again. This time had grilled mahi mahi, was awesome, stop by this place, you will have a good meal, a great time and will not break the bank."}
{"text":"Great karaoke system. Fun KJ. Good  vibe. Free water. My favorite place to sing. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"So these folks are pros! They made us feel welcome like family and served up GREAT food! My new favorite burger and beer place! It is a clean and casually welcoming environment and they even have a patio out back for balmy summer nights! It is just inside an adorable little boutique hotel on Dessert Inn just off StrIp. Good gathering spot for friends, family over 21, or even a date. Feels very safe and cozy!   ps. My sister actually left her credit card there and they found it and locked it up in the safe for her! They are honest folks!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path gem, with good burger and fries. Most importantly, they cook the burgers to how you order it, and provide a quality bun. If I lived here I would frequent this hideaway to relax when I don't want the chaos of the strip."}
{"text":"Food is to die for. The service is excellent as well. Candice, the bartender, and Walter, the chef, had us ready to call this place a second home! The drinks are decently priced and it's a nice little hole in the wall. The patrons of this bar were amazing too. Good energy all around."}
{"text":"A little hidden but we were so glad we found it! A nice retreat from the crowd. The bartender was friendly and the food was superb! Way better than big hotel food. The janopino bacon burger was very tasty and generous. Even the french fry was better! Loved it."}
{"text":"Yikes. I'm trying to think of something positive to say about this place. It's tough. I ordered a 1/2 lb Jalapeno Bacon CheeseBurger cooked Medium. What I got was a burnt up piece of charcoal with 1 small piece of bacon. It had a measly piece of processed cheese on top with canned pickled Jalapeno all for the bargain of 12.95($17.00 with mandatory tax and tip)? Pictures included"}
{"text":"Great Drinks and Amazing Food!!! If you're looking for a fun \"non-strip\" place to hang out, this is not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"I gotta say that the burger are good at a good price. Beer a decent price too.  Definitely bar decor but there is a patio in the back for the smokers. Wife didn't like the wrap because the tortilla was cold so I can't recommend that.  Waitress seemed tired or preoccupied so your not going for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stepped into Till's to get lunch while I waited on my hotel checkin. The bar service was really good, and my good burger and sweet potato fries came out super quick!!! It was nice to have a friendly place to eat. It's not at all overpriced and pushy like so many places on the strip even though t obviously also caters to visitors given its location. I will definitely be back for a bite before I leave."}
{"text":"Good food.  The burger (Jalapeno Burger) was excellent. The Long Island Iced Tea had more alcohol than any other drink I had in Vegas.  There are no prices for alcohol on the menu. The server said our Long Island Iced Tea would be $12... but on our check it was only $8.50. Quite confused on that one but I can only assume they quoted price with tax + tip?  Good food for the price. Location isn't the best if you're staying on the strip. If you're staying between Treasure Island and Circus Circus it's just about walk-able. Anything else is really a no-go.  They add a mandatory 15% service charge. Careful note in case you didn't notice and then essentially double tipped!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick drink before you start your day I recommend to come here first ! Great customer service and good music as well. Only one thing was wrong, I couldn't drink an IPA because it didn't work but the bartender gave me a great offer for another drink :) other than that, great place."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a decent burger, a beer, and a big screen to watch the game. What an unexpected surprise. The 1/2 pound barbecue bacon burger (8.95) was a-ma-zing. Service and hospitality were great. Highly recommend Till's for when you want to get out of the mega-casino world for a great meal at a great price. I'll be back next week."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The chef personally came out to see if my food was up to standard! Wings beat any hands down! Jalape√±o Burger is a great burger! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We just had a great meal @ Till's Bar.  A special shout out to Paige who served us.  She is so sweet and attended to all of our needs!  She is obviously focused on quality and customer service.  Thanks for an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Meredith was our waitress and she was awesome. First time here and it was an awesome EXPERIENCE!! Food was nive and hot. Did i mention very chill enviroment? Most def will come here again. Also just for checking into the resturant i received a free shot. I had the blue cheese burger wings and the bbq chicken pizza everything was awesome. I reccommend the SEX ON THE STRIP SHOT!! It was yum!"}
