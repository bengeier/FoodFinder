{"text":"This take-out place (with limited outdoor seating in warm weather) is good for what it is -- a quick take-out Shawarma and Falafal place for under 10 bucks that serves fast and fresh food.   We usually get the falafel sandwich -- the falafels are freshly made (I've been to places that pre-fry them and let them sit around!!), the salads are decent. I hear the chicken shawarma is good from my brother-in-law, but not had it myself (we are vegetarians). Even my 2 year old likes the food!  While the staff is not the friendliest (just efficient), Habeebe's has location going for it. It is across the way from the harbourfront, so, even though there is no formal seating, just cross the street and enjoy your food by the lake."}
{"text":"A tiny little hole-in-the-wall on the Harborfront, Habeebe's dishes up some quick, cheap shawarma that ain't half bad. Nothing amazingly outstanding, but it's super fast and pretty substantial.  Beef or chicken pitas will run you about $5, with falafel under $4. The meat is pretty good, although the iceberg lettuce and cheap tomatoes bring the whole ensemble down a bit. Load them up with radishes, banana peppers, and Frank's Red Hot (!?) for a tasty time.  Either way, a cooler meal than you'd get just down the street at Subway."}
