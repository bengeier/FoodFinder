{"text":"First time here!  Great indian food with symphony full of flavours in your mouth.  Each dish had its own of spices and flavours!"}
{"text":"This is my third time with extended family at this restaurant. The North Indian dishes are nothing short of phenomenal. We had a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes like malai kofta, Matar mushroom, butter chicken and palak lamb along with appetizers. All dishes were prepared with care and quality ingredients and it is reflected in the first bite. The tandoor  items like chicken tikka and breads like roti and naan were crispy and delicious. Highly recommended if you are looking for traditional North India cuisine."}
{"text":"It was kind of humorous to see the chef/owner laying down in a booth, in the dark, when we arrived.  Decent food... A little 'sauce heavy' though.  Various discounts offered on take out, depending on how much you spend. We had lamb korma (lamb was cooked beautifully), naan bread and though we ordered samosas as well (we were the only people in the restaurant at the time and ordering take away), they forgot to include the samosas in our order. I'd just recommend double checking your order!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery they told me 25 minutes. After awhile I realized my delivery has not arrived and it's been a hour so I called back and they told me another 20 minutes. Highly do not recommend this place, hope this place realizes they suck and shuts this place down"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. It was extremely tasty, it was a little pricey for being an express restaurant. They charge for every single item. But I know I will be going back."}
{"text":"The food is great here. They have the best butter chicken I've had. Great lunch specials and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I walked in and some man was napping in the corner booth (laying down) but got up in a jiff so I assumed he was the owner or worked there. I ordered their lunch special (advertised on their window as 9.95 but was charged regular entree' price of 12.95; only three dollars difference and the girl was not friendly so I didn't want to annoy her over a few bucks. I wish I did now. But I'm positive I asked for the lunch special to the \"not friendly at all\" (or shall I say EXTREMELY UNFRIENDLY) girl at the counter. Maybe she was having a bad day (it was only noonish and I was the only customer in there- no customers at any tables) but it's still uncalled for to be so unwelcoming and rude like I was inconveniencing her.   Then to make my first visit there even worse, was how it was packaged for takeout. My photo says it all! You see only a portion of the sauce spilled in bag, underneath the container is a lot more sauce. And I'm a person who is careful with handling takeout. They use a low quality flimsy styrofoam container to pack a food item that contains mostly sauce and chicken. Seriously, the container was not the normal quality white rectangle styrofoam you encounter for takeout; this container would bend and flop. I've taken out from other Indian restaurants and they have always packaged in a manner that avoids spilling. It's just common sense!I was SO MAD!  About the food? Butter chicken was okay. Nothing to wow over. Will NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places for Indian food in Calgary that is actually authentic. The chef was working previously at a different restaurant so we followed him over. We've been to a majority of Indian restaurants in Calgary and this is our favourite by far. Our go to favourites are the chilli mushroom, boona lamb, and mughlai chicken. You won't be disappointed if you come here."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find an Indian restaurant that will make non-spicy dishes for me...until now! Today had some awesome kadai chicken and kadai paneer...2 days ago delicious fish curry...none of it spicy. I am in heaven! They will, however, make it as spicy as you wish. I am going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Bad quality food and they named quality express. Ordered fish pakora but there was no fish in it. It was just a pakora. Ordered butter chicken it was too sweet feels like eating ras malai. Bad taste bad food bad quality. They don't know how to cook. It was green chili before and they just changed the name the food was even worst than before."}
