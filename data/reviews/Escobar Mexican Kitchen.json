{"text":"Fantastic! Great new neighborhood restaurant under wonderful ownership. Carnitas and enchiladas were winners. We are definitely coming back...again this week! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexico City style cooking( i.e. Not smothered in yellow cheese, with ridiculous portions and massive amounts of sour cream). Family owned, traditional, and healthy alternative to the usual Mexican food in Phoenix. The chef herself actually came out to greet us. So happy this little gem is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mex food. The tamales are light and the best I've ever had. The sopas are fabulous and authentic. This place may be low on ambience but the food and service are out of this world!"}
{"text":"We were craving some good Mexican food and decided to try out a relatively new spot over by the Dutch Bros near 12th and Glendale. This was a great place with cold Dos XX on tap and good tortas! I gotta go back here again soon!"}
{"text":"We loved this little restaurant everything is fresh and homemade and there is great pride in presenting good food. I had the chili relleno which was so superior to the tex mex ones. The guav was fresh and chunky, chips home made.  The carnitas was tasty and juicy especially with a few of the spicy onions thrown in. A great neighborhood jewel!"}
{"text":"Ok all my foodie friends, this place is the real deal Mexican restaurant. All made from scratch! Had REAL menudo today, not like other places, its like your Tia's kitchen! 2 fish tacos, amazing, carne asada, delicious, chinchuroni taco, looks weird tastes Bomb, and a chorizo taco, this was the absolute best! And the flan... oh my! The service and owners were so awesome too! This is a new staple in our dining! You ABSOLUTELY MUST TRY IT!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and I am pleased to say that it is the BEST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  The place is run and owned by a family from Mexico City and the food is all made fresh and are home recipes that are authentic Mexican.  We got to meet Guadalupe, the mom and chef and she is very personable and proud of her cooking,  which she should be!  Everything we got from the ridiculously great guacamole, to the street tacos, to the Escobar salad with their homemade tangy dressing and the salad so fresh it is cool and crunchy, to the carne asade plate with all kinds of goodies on the plate to delight.  The beans were so smooth, creamy, and delicious and the best I ever had!!!  The fish tacos are to die for too!!!  I am coming back to try some more items on the menu as everything has been so wonderful!!  The service was also wonderful and the staff, the family, are all so friendly and welcoming.  It's a wonderful evening to enjoy here!!  Lets get the word out and get this restaurant recognized for it's quality, authentic, fresh, homemade Mexican recipes and tell our friends to check this hot spot out!!  You won't be sorry, it will be your new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"OMG this is one little gem tucked away in the old spinatos and we are so glad we came in ,just wish I would of gone sooner,this is an awesome place with incredible authentic Mexican comfort food I can't wait to come back and I'll tell everyone that I know about this spot !!!!! Carne Asada was perfect, chili relleno was incredible comfort food , homemade salsas were spot on rice was totally authentic the salad was fresh and also very good and the sope was the bomb on a hand made tortilla, I am just completely satisfied with my first visit and it certainly won't be my last !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been treated to fantastic food and friendly service every time that I've dined at Escobar.  It's quickly becoming a favorite for Mexican food.  I cannot recommend the guacamole enough.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip the guac."}
{"text":"Great fresh guacamole!! Great place for taco Tuesday. Food made with love and Keith was a great server!"}
{"text":"I nearly never write reviews,  but this is some of the best mexican food i have ever had so i wanted to spread the word.  We had the chile rellano, carnitas, a green chili chicken tomale, and the chocolate flan.  They were all spectacular.  It tasted like i was eating an amazing home cooked meal,  not like i was at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Glad to see a restaurant succeeding in this space. I hope they stick around.  I brought some out-of-towners here and we ordered a little bit of everything to try. Not one thing disappointed us - My favorite was the quesadilla, which was prepared differently than usual.  It was crispy, flaky and fried. Service was great - waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. Prices were very reasonable and I appreciated that the portions were not huge.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great casual authentic Mexican spot! Come in for taco Tuesday and get some amazing Mexico City street tacos! Prices are super reasonable. Friendly wait staff and manager as well.Something great about a good family owned restaurant. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Great service. I chose this place because of the other yelp reviews. It was good food overall but I wish the chips and salsa came with all orders. I enjoyed the street tacos. The chorizo taco was my favorite. My husband ordered the catfish. He said the catfish ok nothing special but the toppings made the dish. He had to order extra tortillas for the dish. Bueno!"}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Seriously the best street tacos, chicken tamales, carnitas and horchata I have had in years! I have been craving solid Mexican food for at least 7 months, and I almost cried when I tasted the sauces and guacamole as starters.  I rarely comment on yelp, but you guys deserve to know how much your food made my day"}
{"text":"The food and service were terrific.  We had a couple of fried quesadillas, the guac, and chilaquiles with eggs, and for dessert, tres leches cake.  Everything was remarkably delicious.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great people! Street tacos were excellent! Plus yummy Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Great Mex beers on tap and authentic chow, inexpensive and absolutely delicious. For those of us who judge a restaurant on the quality of standard offerings, the house made guacamole and fresh tortillas are top notch. We started with the shrimp ceviche which was chock full of fresh tomatoes, sweet onion, cilantro and plenty of avocado. Shrimp were plentiful, plump and briney. This dish arrived with 3 house made salsas of varying heat indexes, to add some serious zip. Also ordered the bistec combo and black bean salad, both solid offerings. We'll be back often...next time with friends!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The gorditas and street tacos are fantastic - spicy mix of great flavors. The guacamole is the best we've had around here in a long time. Spouse had the carnitas, and loved them.   The gentleman who waited on us was the nicest, happiest person we've been around in a long time - he made our visit particularly wonderful!   This is real Mexican food in a place that is warm, friendly and not fancy. Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat down and no service for 10 minutes with only two other patrons in the restaurant .  It was an evening around 6. Can't speak to the food we never got a chance to order."}
{"text":"One of my new spots. Hard to compete with what this location used to be. I am a fan of the empanadas, the chilada, and the tacos al pastor when available. You can taste the homemade Mexican food! When we want last week, service was a scattered. I think because of the whole family owned and operated kind of thing that that's WHY I continue to come here. Also, grab the chilaquiles. Egg on top just makes it better!"}
{"text":"Just left Escobar! Had Chilequilles with Egg and Carne-I ate more than I should have-now I'm stuffed!! It was just sooo good!! So full of flavor! The ultimate in comfort food!! Please eat here-you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"I love this food!!! This is not the Americanized Mexican food smothered in cheeses. This is authentic Mexican food that is absolutely delicious and fresh made everyday! The hot sauce is incredible!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! Had the tomatillo salsa and chips which was my favorite part of the meal, and then the Chile relleno and carnitas. Putting some carnitas on the relleno was delicious. Thanks for the suggestion, Keith!! Keith is the best, too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Keith the bartender is amazing- such great service. Started with the guac which was fresh and very traditional - Had the carne & pork tacos, gorditas, tres leche and flan. Margaritas were fantastic and you can tell they were made from fresh juices.  Very authentic Mexico City traditional food :)"}
{"text":"So we've been here a few times now, and each time it keeps getting better. The chilequellitas were perfectly crunchy and the relleno very flavorful, perfect for a light meal. If you want to fill up, try the Escobar-ger. This come with enough add-ons to tailor this burger to anyone's taste. Next visit, the catfish!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and incredible service! The street tacos were phenomenal. The happy hour was impressive. The family who  operates Escobar make it a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing review in The Phoenix Magazine.  Certainly glad we did, our appetizer shrimp ceviche was excellent, our torta served with the best ever old-fashioned fresh cut french fries were so wonderful tasting. Also we tried the chicken street tacos, wow everything was made with the best and freshest ingredients. Then, you must not miss dessert, we had the choco-flan, it was oh so yummy.  This is a great family run restaurant, they all truly care about the customer.  We highly recommend this authentic Mexican restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try other entrees along with one of their freshly mixed margaritas."}
{"text":"I started at the bar with a handmade margarita, no pre-made mix. I ordered the tampiqueña. It was so tender, I used the butter knife to cut into this perfectly seasoned cut of beef. I then ordered an IPA beer on draft. They also serve California wines.  They make a pozole on Saturdays and if you like beef tripe, the menudo is served on Sundays. I would highly recommend this place, the owner and chef Guadalupe will personally come to your table and chat with you."}
{"text":"Amazing if you haven't tried this place please do. Everything is homemade from scratch. I had the seafood stew the broth was amazing.  The chef came out and told us it was a recipe from her years in Acapulco.   This is a little treasure in central phoenix. If you looking for the traditional Tex mex or Sonoran style Mexican food this is not the place but if your looking for excellent is Mexico City style Mexican food you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The bartender was our server, and he was very nice and attentive. The guacamole was some of the best I've had out. All the food was delicious. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Authentic, flavorful and delicious Mexican food! This place captures all the great flavors of Mexican cuisine and will exceed all your expectations! Great menu options that all pack  a lot of flavor, and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent margaritas, and the staff has a great personality!  Really made for an awesome experience. One of the best tamales in a 10 mile area!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  It is a little hard to find but totally worth it. The margaritas are good and made with care by Keith the bartender. All the food is homemade and they really take pride in making sure you are satisfied. The street tacos are wonderful and so is the Mole. We had a party of 15 people and they took great care of us!!!"}
{"text":"WOW, the taco meat, beef, was AMAZING! Keith was our waiter, he was awesome. Mexican scrabbled eggs was awesome. It's one of those places you might just drive by and miss. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and had been told of this little restaurant which serves good Mexican food (Mexico City style) at a reasonable price. We stopped by tonight on Taco Tuesday, where tacos were discounted.  We were met by the bartender who was funny and friendly. The menu looked interesting so we tried a variety of things: a couple of street tacos (the chorizo one was excellent), a couple of tamales (the mushroom and cheese was divine, especially with a little of their homemade salsa on it), the green enchiladas really (wonderfully prepared with fresh tortillas and a most delectable tomatillo green sauce with sour cream and white cheese), mole (pretty good). Oh, almost forgot the delightful appetizer, choriqueso - flavorful chorizo sausage with melted cheese and freshly made chips. The margaritas were tasty, too, and the beer on tap very reasonable.  Actually, the entire meal was inexpensive for all the food we received.  It is a little gem of a place we'll be sure to visit again. If you want a different type of Mexican food adventure, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place has authentic Mexico City food! It was fantastic the enchiladas were nothing like traditional ones and were amazing. The queso and salsa were so different and were great... we will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish. Cold beer. I mean cold!!!  Great guacamole. Wonderful homemade salsas. Are you kidding me with the veggie tamale options?!?!  Great place for veggies."}
{"text":"Such a unique menu. Good food for sure. I got their Pambazo Torta, which is like nothing I've seen. Spicy, decadent."}
{"text":"Super find thanks to Yelp. I tried the sopes and homemade guacamole. Both were excellent-the guac maybe even better than excellent.  Service was great, too. Senora Escobar came out and chatted with those of us in the dining room, which was lovely. Not a white-table cloth, date-night place, just good food and company."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant ! Family owned, very delicious , very friendly ! We will be back!!! Gracias!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great hospitality, great happy hour. Excellent marg for only $3 (happy hour) made by Keith. The pambazo torta is a must."}
{"text":"We just tried Escobar. It is a Mexican restaurant in the space where Spinattos was. The food is very tasty and fresh. I had the enchilada plate and it was extremely bright and savory with a bit of spicyness. My wife had the chili relleno which was mildly spicy, but fresh and tender. I will go back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and without yelp I would have never tried it. Everything we ate from the queso appetizer to the chocolate flan dessert was phenomenal. The service was friendly and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Just finished my first meal at this restaurant.  Wow!  The food is amazing and 100% authentic food.  I had green mole served over pork while my husband had Carne Asada street tacos and a pork and green chili tamale.  Amazing.  We finished  off the meal with a fresh pumpkin tamale and whip cream."}
{"text":"We came here based on previous reviews. The food here was awesome! We had selections off the street menu as well as the entree menu. I will be back here for sure. The service was spectacular and the chef came to the table to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"My husband, 2 year old, and I ate here last night and loved it! As soon as we sat down our waitress asked for our drink orders and asked if she could bring some rice,  beans, french fries, or something for my daughter (this is the first time this has ever happened and was very thoughtful!) The guacamole and chips were delicious. I had the sope with Carne asada and the pork street tacos - both were seriously tasty. My husband had the mushroom and cheese quesadilla and the Carne asada street tacos and loved all of it! The prices are so great and the service was awesome! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a couple of times and have only had their tacos which we became fans of.  This visit we were less impressed, in fact very disappointed. I ordered the Chilaquiles and added egg and carne asada to it for an additional charge and my friend (did I mention she is from Mexico City where the owner is from) ordered a beef torta to go.  When we sat down to eat it at home I had to search for the carne asada, there was only about a table spoon of very small, dried tough beef which was extremely fatty.  There wasn't 1 piece I could eat and passed it on to the dog.  My friend's beef sandwhich wasn't much better and very chewy.  The kicker is my friend called the restaurant not to get anything in return but to give them a heads up about the food.  The guy that answered said it was suppose to be tough and fatty for the flavor.  WTH??????  Seriously????  She even told him I couldn't chew the meat and had to give it to the dog, but it didn't matter.  Needless to say after we each ate about a 1/4 of the food the rest went to the dogs and I was out $27 (yes, $27 which included a $2 tip on food to go).  We may go back, but only for the tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing guacamole! Pretty good tacos & margaritas. Service was slow, but it was Cinco de Mayo, so I'm sure they were busier than usual."}
{"text":"What do you call two folded up pasty tortillas with unseasoned green sauce poured on top with an over abundance of creama and queso fresco?  They call it an enchilada.   The waitress was snotty and rude with a bizarre superiority complex about her food and the freshness of her food.  I tried to ask her questions about the sauces and all she did was cut me off and talk over me!  It was the WORST service I have ever had! I almost walked out, but I was trying not to make a scene in front of my son.  She gave us three half filled squeeze bottles of sauces and then left.  No chips or salsa at this place!  I was up charged $2.00 to add chicken, which doesn't sound bad, but it was cut into match stick size pieces and tasted like sawdust.  There were about two bites of chicken in total.  Yikes right? There was so much creama and queso fresco it just drowned everything else out, except the sawdust chicken, which was on top of the cheesy mess.  I can't believe how many people loved this place?  I would have given it more stars if the service had been  at least decent.  Sorry, but never again!"}
{"text":"Given the 4.5 star rating I had high expectations.  This rating should be reserved for fine establishments.  This was a casual restaurant, with so-so food.  I also had high expectations due to two mentions in the Phoenix Magazine.  One specifically mentioned the ceviche which I found to taste too tomatoey-out-of-a-can and not much else.  The shrimp was shaved into thin pieces which I found weird.  The guacamole was pretty bland, kicked up only be the salsas made in house apparently.  Pretty good.  Also they raved about this matriarch run restaurant that was authentic Mexico City style.  I felt everything was processed and not very fresh.  I was thinking more home-cooking instead of \"restaurant\" cooking I guess.  Also the waitress was not really friendly and made me feel uncomfortable for asking what was in the tomatillo salsa that made it so tangy!  I was just interested, not asking for the secret recipe!  That was the only thing that was really delicious!  And my husband said the street tacos were good.  Definitely a 3 star for me.  Nothing more- just ok."}
{"text":"I am torn on this review. They were super friendly and attentive. Very knowledgeable and ready to help. However, being from san diego then menu was disappointing in compared to what we are used to. Just not the variety we were hoping for. The food is fresh, servings a little small for the price though. Just not what we are used to."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service.   Owner/chef came to greet us personally.  Exceptional customer service.  Will recommend to friends and family.  Food very tasty and affordable 5 stars!"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM.   This small mom and pop place was such a pleasant surprise.  The food was fantastic and very Mexico City style authentic. We ordered the choriqueso and totopos (chips)and salsa as an appetizer.  Both were excellent. The choriqueso had a nice spice mixed with the melted cheese.  The green salsa also was the best.  I had the mole as a main course and was not disappointed.  I loved the rich flavor of all the spices.  I can't wait to come back and try the ceviche, tamales and street tacos."}
{"text":"I had the street tacos (carne asada, pork and chicken) and my wife had the enchiladas. The street tacos were excellent and served very traditional on corn tortillas. The enchiladas are not TexMex and served with a green sauce. They bring out a tomatillo sauce, a medium hot sauce and a roasted habanero hot sauce. I really enjoyed the tomatillo sauce. It is a smaller place but the food and ambiance is great. Everything had a great flavor. I would definitely recommend it to everyone and will  definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and I'm writing this with the help of my 8 and 10 year old kids. Those were their words. The food is delicious and I agree! Street tacos to rival those in Mexico City. Great rice and beans. All this and a nice $3 margarita on the side! Sweet! The only issue was the service was a little on the slow side. Not sure if they were just understaffed this particular night. Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Happy to be one of the first yelpers to try this place because I enjoyed it and want a restaurant in my neighborhood to do well. The food is basic Mexican, but they do it well. You can tell they have experience from their previous location, as the service is efficient and friendly. The bar seems well stocked and prices are reasonable, so come on down for authentic Mexican in a nicer location than some places."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, pleasant atmosphere and very friendly people. Met the owners and enjoyed every minute of our experience. The quesadilla is magnificent. Don't miss Escobar's if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and we were nearby, so we stopped in for a late lunch. Never a bad time for some quality Mexico City Mexican food. It was mid afternoon on a Saturday, so we just bellied up to the little bar and ordered a couple beers. Family owned and run, and they are proud of that. They should be. I sampled several of the tacos and my wife had the special that I can't remember. Tacos were very good, but the pork carnitas were among the best I have had. Pork was crazy tender and juicy.   Mom came out from the kitchen to say hello and to make sure we liked our meals. She talked us into some homemade pumpkin desert tamales. How could we say no? Not a big pumpkin desert fan, but it was great.  Rumor has it that her burger is awesome. Next time. There will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"Great authentic REAL Mexican food. Flavorful food and incredibly attentive family that you can tell pours love into what they make. So happy we came here for lunch, this place deserves mention! Good prices too."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  The owner and her staff are the happiest, friendliest restaurant folks we've ever encountered and we're in the business 40+ years ourselves. Her food is perfection!!  When we told her that she hugged and kissed both of us and then later sat with us for a few minutes. Very rare to find someone so passionate about their craft.   We ate quesadillas de pollo and huitlacoche, a gordita de requeson and red and green tamales. Each was better than the one before. Chicken and steak are grilled and so super tasty. The steak has a little crunch from the griddle. Mmmm. The guacamole was warm and smooth with a kick of fresh jalapeño. Insanely delicious!!  $3 margaritas and $1 off beer during happy hour.   The prices are beyond reasonable. They should be charging more. 3 beers, 2 margaritas, an appetizer plus the food above all for $43. Unbelievable!!  We will be back often and with everyone we know."}
{"text":"I ordered tamales which were delicious! The owner came out and greeted us which added a very personal touch to the service. Everyone loved their food and our table had quite a variety. The only bad thing was NO COMPLIMENTARY chips and salsa- I love Mexican food and this was the first Mexican restaurant I've ever been to that didn't provide chips! So I bought them- and was disappointed to see they came in squeeze bottles! So it was more like chips and sauce. However, I'd go back if I were out that way again."}
{"text":"Really good little place, very affordable. Ask Keith for one of his famous Beergaritas."}
{"text":"Refreshing to find a Mexican restaurant that serves authentic Mexican City Food! All food is prepared fresh upon ordering, and it's delicious! Great restaurant for families and groups alike. Keith The Bartender is the bomb! (Best margaritas in Uptown Phx!)"}
{"text":"The family and I had dinner here yesterday (December 26, 2015) and had pozole, chilequiles, and carne asada tacos.  All of it was good and nice sized portions.  What impressed us the most is how the food is served like it would be in someone's home.  The vegetables, chile, and tostadas on the side was authentic, fresh and delicious.  For dessert we had a chocolate tamale that was perfect.  Not too sweet, lots of chocolate flavor and not too small.  There's a good selection of beers that are reasonably priced, plenty of different tequilas and margaritas, and a decent happy hour.  The service was great and the price for four of us was very reasonable.  Check this place out before it gets tough to get a table!"}
{"text":"Great food.   Just got home from our first but not last visit. Wife had Carnitas and I had Mole, both were wonderful.  Guacamole was just the way we like it, avocado, garlic and salt. Let's celebrate the avocado.   Three wonderful table sauces.  You won't go wrong here, this is great Mexico City food.  Dinner for 2, before tip $38.00, we had iced tea to drink."}
{"text":"Service and food was great! I was with my family staying at the pointe Hilton and yelped some mexican food places and this one can up so we decided to go. It was a wonderful surprise not super busy great atmosphere. We had the enchiladas and the tamales (all versions of the tamales)!  Which we all highly recommend!  All the food was great that we tried! worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would. We had top shelf margaritas. Basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly. Atmosphere and service was about the same."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING pork tamales! I love them so much, and if they were bigger portion wise, this place would get 5 stars. Not into tamales? Try the street tacos. This place has fresh food and I truly am a fan. You should definitely check this place out. Customer service is always great!"}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant!!  I love the fish tacos and chorizo gorditas.  Very authentic Mexican food.  And the happy hour has very tasty margaritas too!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the quality and flavor of the food.  Service was very genuine and natural.  As a nice bonus, the prices are really good...especially happy hour!  This will be a regular dinnertime stop for us."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give no stars I would!!! The Host/ Bartender woman is the rudest person I ever encountered. Her responses are very short and rude. She couldn't give a run down about the chocolate tamales it was just too stressful for her to do so, instead I got rude gestures and remarks!! I couldn't tell they were running a business yet a restaurant. Not the way to treat people especially new customers. I will never step foot in your establishment again. Not even a free meal would want me to attend this place."}
{"text":"Legit home style Mexican food, or as close as it gets.   I had the chile relleno, and it was done so perfectly! The tomato sauce was so light and had the perfect amount of seasoning and broth. The batter was also perfect, not thick at all or too heavily fried. Inside was cheesy goodness- Yum!   The bf had the fried chicken and it very closely resembled my mom's 'pollo frito'- so that means it was bomb.com, ok?    Eat here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"$2 Bloody Mary's all day on Sundays., not to mention some of the best authentic homemade Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The owner who is also the chef came out to see how we enjoyed the food.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant.  They use fresh ingredients which makes it quality food.  We tried a little bit of everything and was not disappointed even the salsa was amazing.  Definitely will be are go to place."}
{"text":"I had a classic case of 'driving while hungry' & saw this place had great reviews. What a great decision!!! It's a hidden gem that I'll definitely be visiting again. I made a combo out of a fried squash blossom quesadilla, sope & chicharron taco. Everything was delicious, including the 3 salsas brought to the table. I also had agua tamarinda & it was delicious, not overly sweet like so many I've had. It's not a place that brings you chips & salsa served with flavorless food. It's obvious they put pride in their food & this will be one decision you won't regret!"}
{"text":"We had the Chile En Nogada and it was amazing. Kieth the waiter was just amazing too. Funny, helpful and full of personality. A must go to restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and received excellent, fresh, cooked-to-order food (Chile Relleno and Chilaquiles) with very attentive service (Keith the bartender and Guadalupe, chef/owner). Will be back!"}
{"text":"Armando was great.  Ask for the salsa sampler. Great stuff. Also had street tacos that were the bomb and a chorizo queso was delicious. I don't know what Peter is talking about!!!"}
{"text":"The bomb. Home made authentic Mexican with cerveza and great service. A don't miss!  Tucked inside a little strip mall and unassuming from the outside but great menu."}
{"text":"Solid, authentic food at reasonable prices and the owner/chef is super friendly and came and greeted us and gave us suggestions.  Sunday features $2 bloody marys, which are more of the clamato variety then I care for but the price was right.  The food is cooked with little cheese or sour cream.  Indeed the chef made a point of telling another table about how that is how the food is actually cooked in the part of Mexico she is from.  I really enjoyed each of the three salsas that came with the chips and salsa, as well as the fish taco street taco that had a nice piece of fried fish.  The chocolate and pineapple tamales were interesting, but I probably would not get them again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.  I had the street tacos (one of each except the fish) and they were all great.  The pork taco had some onions on top that were very spicy but they do warn you ahead of time.  Best one was the chorizo. Guacamole was AMAZING! Ceviche was the only part that was just ok.  It wasn't your typical citrus ceviche with lemon...when we told the waitress we didn't like it, she took it.  Then the manager came over and apologized and offered to give us a discount.  Then the chef/owner came out and sat with us and explained to us why the ceviche was different than normal ceviche.  We weren't even upset...this was soooo nice of them! Service was GREAT! Cute little family owned spot."}
{"text":"Oh wow. This place is amazing. I have to return so I can eat more things from here. It's Mexico City food, and it's all made from scratch. It is delicious. I had the tortilla soup (was under the weather), a chicken sope, and jamaica. The soup wad amazing. I caught myself making good food noises aloud even though I dined alone. The sope was delicious too. And the jamaica was fresh and so good. This is going to be a new regular place for me to eat. Foodies- this is a must try."}
{"text":"We love Escobar! Found this little gem on Yelp. what a great find. I almost don't want anyone else to know about it because then it will get busy and we won't get a table right away. that's greedy though and unfair to such an awesome restaurant. Keith is great and must work 7 days a week because he's always there. Take a day off buddy. actually no...don't. We want you there to make a signature margarita for us. The food has so much flavor and is not heavy or greasy. everything we have had has been terrific! props to Escobar!"}
{"text":"I will try again but will be a little more cautious about what beverage I order.  This is a very family friendly restaurant and the staff is very nice, as is the owner who comes around to make sure everything is good.  This was our first visit here and I had read many good reviews online and from friends. The tacos and carnitas meal that we had was very good. The Spanish rice won't be ordered again as it had no flavor at all.  The surprise was when we received the check. We had each ordered a glass of what we thought was an inexpensive Chardonnay, Clos Du Bois, which is typically $10 a bottle. We were charged $20 for 2 glasses!  My fault I guess for not asking how much the glass of wine might be, their fault for not listing the price on the board next to the description.  Will we go back - maybe,  but before I order an adult beverage I will confirm the price."}
{"text":"Went there with a neighbor for lunch cause I had heard good things about it.    It is tucked into a strip shopping center, and I thought it was merely a take-out restaurant.   Was pleasantly surprised it is a regular sit-down restaurant.   We scanned the menu.   We both decided to try the carnitas.   Great choice!   The chicken was shredded and nicely seasoned.   On the side are refried beans, corn tortillas, and in a small bowl is a side of onions seasoned with jalapenos.   Hmmm.   jalapenos?   Since the onions are purple in color and I did not see any evidence of green, I thought I'd take a tiny bite to see how jalapeno-like it is.   WHOA!   Glad I took a small bite.   It's hot!   And I like hot.   The server brought three bottles of sauce, one green, two red.   We were told one of the red bottles is hot.   After tasting the onions, I thought I'd better heed her words.   I decided to mix the beans and the onions in with the chicken and put a bit of the green salsa/sauce.   Perfecto!    I would definitely go back.   It would be nice if they gave the option of flour tortillas versus the corn since I don't like corn tortillas.   Yes, they have happy hour but it is only on the drinks.    If they added food to the HH menu, I might give it a shot.    I know I would definitely go back for lunch if not dinner."}
{"text":"Please try this place. The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.  The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.  Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas.   By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.  This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12)."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place wasn't busier. The food was really good. My whole family enjoy everything we ordered. I had the Carnitas and they were outstanding. My wife really enjoyed her Street Tacos. I know there are a lot of choices for Mexican food but you need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"We were craving Tacos...well it was taco Tuesday afterall. So, we decided to try someplace new. This place is on the smaller side, but was slow when we got there. The staff greeted us immediately and we got a seat  not long after. This was a plus.  The server was also the bartender. He was very friendly and did his best, but i think the end result is they could use another server. He forgot a few things(like drinks), but overall not terrible.   The food was excellent! We both had tacos. I tried the carne asada, pollo, and green chili pork. All were good and on special. They are smaller size so order a few extra is you are hungry.   We will try this place out again. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant right around the corner from my home wish I would have found it sooner! The people who work here are always kind and polite and the owner and chef is absolute sweet heart. She always come out  and ask how our food is and if we liked it she reminds me of my Hispanic heritage her food is very spicy flavorful and everything she makes is fresh. Go here it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is real-deal authentic and downright delicious.  Service is great.  Street tacos and enchiladas were both really good.  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a place you can go after you hit the gym or when your hair isn't done or you don't want to get dressed up. It's a simple family owned restaurant with simple decor.  We came over on a night where I had no makeup on (gasp) and I was practically ready for bed but I was starving. The restaurant had a few parties and we were told there would be a slight wait bc the kitchen was backed up. The waiter notices my annoyance and gave us complimentary salsa and chips while we waited. The chips were a little too hard for me, but it was a nice gesture.  We proceeded to order the carne asada and chicharon street tacos and chicken enchiladas. Everything was good and we didn't leave anything on our plate - even the beans and we aren't even big bean eaters. The employees are really sweet and they asked if we were gonna get dessert. I originally declined but one of them kept talking about her mom's Tres Leches cake so I finally caved in. It was delicious!!   Price of the check: a little over $19. Overall, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Mole Pablano is out of this world and completely authentic. Guadalupe is charming and sweet and knowledgable. Keith the bartender is hilarious and makes a great Margarita."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. My girlfriend and I have slowly been working our way through the menu and have not had anything we didn't like. The food is simply top notch excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Newly opened in Spinatos old location.  This is not typical Mexican food. I don't know what region it's from but it's definitely different - in a good way.  I lean vegetarian so chose the quesadillas stuffed with mashed potatoes and WOW they were good.  The menu looks very intriguing so I'll be back  I love to support local family owned businesses so I've got my fingers crossed for these folks!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I wasn't expecting good food, before going in I had read mostly positive reviews so I knew it was good. The central/southern Mexican style was a bit different from many of my favorite places around here and interesting change of pace. But what struck me most was the dedication and attention to detail from Guadalupe and her staff, very impressive!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Great service.  Negra Modelo on tap.  Chorizo tacos and quesadilla were perfect.  My wife had tasty fish tacos.  Beers, tacos and dilla' for $22.    I'll be a regular here as its walkable.  I'll still occasionally pickup a green chile burrito at nearby Los Taquitos, but Escobar's is my #1."}
{"text":"Really nice place for authentic Mexican food. Family owned. Staff was great and really nice. Food was great. 1st time here. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious. Home made. Authentic. Not pre-packaged, flavorless, dried out. Keith The Bartender makes you feel at home the minute you walk in, he made me an amazing margarita, and his non-alcoholic drinks are also superb! It was Taco Tuesday yesterday and I ate 4 of them - carne asada, chicken, pork, and chicharron. All of them fantastic but the chicharron was my favorite. Ceviche appetizer was good, I should have gotten guacamole - gives me an excuse to return! Clean, plenty of seating and not all crowded together. Dessert: pastel de tres leches. OBVIOUSLY homemade and I stopped short (barely) of licking the plate. Go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Paid our first visit to Escobar's today and am so glad we did. Probably will go again tomorrow. Maybe the day after, too. If it's cheesy, sauce smothered Sonoran or SoCal style Mexican you base your expectations on then move along, there's nothing to see here. On the other hand, if it's REAL Mexican food you're after then this is the place. Fernada and her family bring you their recipes from Mexico, D. F., and Puebla. All reasonably priced. My wife and I (obviously) could not sample everything on the menu in one visit but we sure would have liked to try. What we did have though was delicious. Really. They have daily specials and, in the fall, watch for Chiles Rellenos En Nogada. We grew up in the PHX area but retired to Mexico 4 years ago and eating at Escobar's made us pine for \"home\". Fortunately, we don't have to cut our visit short just yet but I do know where you'll often find us in the meantime. Let's see, tomorrow's special is enchiladas verde. Hmmm."}
{"text":"Margarita was your standard bottled mix, overly sweet.  Enchiladas were basically just a pile of green salsa.  Pork tamale was super salty.  No chips and salsa.  On the plus side, it's right by my parents' house, in the old spinatos place, and the prices are really cheap. $1.50 bud lights during happy hour, which goes until 7:00 every night I think! In this neighborhood, if I want Mexican, I'll hit Los Taquitos or Carlos Obriens."}
{"text":"Love the different approach than the normal Mexican food and the people who work there are very nice!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to Escobar Mexican Kitchen for a quick power lunch, and I'm really glad I did.  Escobar has been open for about 6 months now in a location that previously housed a Spinnatto's Pizza, then a short lived Italian restaurant.   The menu is relatively simple, but full of unique items that differ from your standard Mexican restaurant fare.  This feels much more authentic.  I stuck with ice water and had the Chilaquiles (sort of like a Mexican version of lasagna) topped with one egg over easy and a side of refried pinto beans.    -- The meal was totally delicious and I felt like the portion was just right for lunch.  I would have eaten more because the flavor was REALLY good, and I appreciate that they portioned the meal correctly.    -- My bill was about $8, including tax, plus tip.  No kidding.  I consider this to be a bargain, especially given the high quality of my meal, and I think keeping the portion size in check for lunch is probably part of what contributes to this very affordable pricing.     -- Service was friendly and expedient.    -- The restaurant interior & decor is basic, nothing over the top.   A few booths, mostly tables, a take out counter near the entrance.  No complaints.      This place is near my office and I will be back for many lunches without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here!  We had the guacamole appetizer , the Chicken Mole and Carnitas. Everything was fresh and tastey. This is a family bussiness and not a chain . I wish them great success in their venture."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! I had the Choriqueso - a little greasy, but most chorizo is. Perfect amount of heat. The Pozole was as good as I've ever had in a restaurant. The margaritas were obviously not made from a mix & delicious. All 3 salsas were tasty but the green was a little to sour. The 2 Reds were hot & yummy! can't wait to visit again with my husband."}
{"text":"As I type my first Yelp review I can only think of the South Park episode from last season, and it makes a lot of sense based on how most yelp reviews are written... I digress.. This place is the best! The food is so bomb and comes out so hot, the service is excellent too. Such a cool little place to unwind and enjoy great food with a family touch. I can't wait to go back for a third time. I recommend this spot to anyone I come across. A+"}
{"text":"One word: delicious! We were hungry, so naturally we looked at yelp for late lunch/early dinner ideas. I stumbled upon Escobar, a place with not very many reviews, but all high, less than a mile from our house. How could we go wrong?  We were promptly greeted upon entering and seated at a table in the dining area. The very nice waiter (and possibly bartender? wish we got his name!) informed us that it was happy hour (yay!) and told us the daily specials.  I ordered a margarita ($3 during happy hour) and C ordered a blue moon ($2 draft during happy hour). We ordered the guacamole based on the other reviews. The drinks were fantastic, as was the guacamole - would definitely recommend.  We decided to order dinner from the street items menu so we could try a variety of things. C ordered 2 chicken street tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. I ordered the chorizo gordita and a chicken and green salsa tamale. My items were very, very good, but C's street tacos were AMAZING. The chicken was super moist and tender, and it had been marinaded in something that gave it the most delicious flavor. A must try, indeed!   This is a wonderful, hidden gem in the north central neighborhood that is worthy of a visit!"}
{"text":"What a neat little gem! If you would like to take a break from the traditional, greasy Sonoran style Mexican food, give Escobar a try.   Small, unassuming place in a strip mall. Inside casual, yet refined.   We started out with the potato taquito things as an appetizer. Because I'm obsessed with potato tacos and have a hard time finding them in AZ although they are everywhere in California. They were delicious, especially with the trio of hot sauces they bring to your table.  My husband has a combo plate that had steak, a cheese enchilada, beans, rice. He thought it was very tasty. I tasted the cheese enchilada and was blown away about how delicious the sauce was.  I had the chili relleno. It was very good but I'm very picky with my chili rellenos. So it wasn't my favorite. But after tasting my husband's enchilada, I am definitely getting those next time!  Service was great. Warm, laid- back, and friendly. We will defintely be back!"}
{"text":"Street tacos were amazing (carne, chicken and chorizo), house margaritas were fantastic and the chorizo queso for an appetizer was great.  The atmosphere was casual and fun.  Our server was excellent and made it a good time.  The owner and chef came out and thanked us for coming in to eat.  I wish I had known about this spot earlier.  It's fantastic and I will definitely start cementing my status as a regular here.  Can't wait to try one of the tortas because I smelled the fresh bread being cooked."}
{"text":"Definitely a good happy hour and the service was beyond exceptional.  New to the area and was happy with the quality of food."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Very clean. Everything seemed fresh and homemade.  Full of flavor.  Even the lemonade was delicious."}
{"text":"O.M.G. This place is INCREDIBLE! This is the place to go if you want some authentic mexican food. We went with a group of ten and ordered a wide variety of the menu, everything is amazing. The guac, the street tacos, the mole, a few things whose names I don't remember. The point is you can't go wrong. Definitely get a margarita. What's even better than the incredible food is that the service is good, it's a family owned business, AND the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Very authentic family owned and run restaurant.  The food reminded me of food I've had in Mexico city.  In fact I was told by the server that they are her Mom's recipes and the family is from Mexico city.  I would recommend trying the enchiladas, they were unlike anything I've had here in the valley."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, Escobar is a gem.  A casual little place in an admittedly uninspiring small strip mall, and from the outside you'd never know what deliciousness awaits you.  It's run by a local family, and the mom & pop vibe is evident in both service and sustenance.  The menu isn't extensive, which I like- unpretentious and positively delicious dishes prepared with love and taste like an practiced Mexican grandma labored in the kitchen to present you with an incredible, authentic family meal (rather than cheddar melted over canned refried beans!).  The prices are reasonable, it's kid-friendly, every dish I've had is scrumptious, and the icing on the cake is that their margaritas are extraordinary!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the mole with a side of Guac. I have been eating low-carb the last couple of months and instead of the rice and beans, I get a side salad and that salad dressing is so addicting and is made with fresh lemons. When I am feeling like I want to splurge, the Pambazo is the best choice with a side of their hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Had higher hopes for this new place but after first try I am fairy disappointed,m. carne tacos were dry & uneventful, Guacamole is good, vegetarian tamale decent. Overall it's an ok place."}
{"text":"On a whim, my coworker and I were looking for some good, quick tacos... After some Yelp research (3 mins) we stumbled upon Escobar... We were skeptical after first but we were up for a new place... It is in a hidden plaza just east of the Dutch Bros but there is a sign on the road. (Glendale) We went inside and there were (3) employees. They were all nice and talkative. The employees informed us about the food being authentic Mexico City food so not like any of the tex-mex which is abundant in the Central part of the city... They were so enthused and proud to share the culture of the food and it's difference among Mexican foods that can be found... It was neat to hear and I was looking forward to the food.  The host/server gave us each a glass of water and the menu. She provided recommendations for favorites and easy things for to-go eating... After looking through the menu, I went for the enchiladas with no meat and one carne Asada taco... My coworker opted for three chicken street tacos and an order of chips and salsa + Guac....   We paid the nice lady and the prices were decent. Not too high.   After we returned to our office, everyone in our building came to our door and was like, \"Something smells yummy!\" The enchiladas were great. The beans that came with it were a little more on the runny side but they are really good. My carne Asada taco was great as well, the meat was flavorful and I liked how it came with a lime and (2) slices of cucumber...   I asked my coworker what she thought about the food and she said it was great! I asked if she would go back and she said Yes!  The chips and Guac were our favorite thing because the Guac was really, really good! We received a large dollop of it too and we got to the point of having no more chips but just eating the Guac... It was that good!   Over all, the people were great and the food was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Trusted yelpers and it paid off again.  Hand made in the restaurant kitchen authentic food and sauces.  Will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"We had a delicious and authentic meal at Escobar's.  The guacamole was excellent as well as my carnitas dinner.  And the selection of 3 salsas were the best.  Such unique flavors.  The chef visited each table to ask if we enjoyed the food which was a nice welcoming touch.  Our waiter, Keith, was so funny and gave us great service.  Definitely recommend Escobar's."}
{"text":"Loving this place as one of the only spots for authentic DF-style Mexican food in the Valley, with hard-to-find items like huitlacoche, pambazo, and chiles en nogada on the menu!  Came here for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  We tried the quesadillas with mushrooms and queso Oaxaca and huitlacoches (basically corn smut, also known as Mexican truffles), which were perfectly fried and stuffed with their respective fillings.  (As you may know, a real quesadilla has no resemblance to that item you get at Taco Bell.)  We also had sopes with tender and flavorful carne asada, carnitas served with onions pickled with habanero for a generous kick, a gordita (again, nothing like what you order at Taco Bell, it's a corn masa patty split and stuffed with fillings) with requesen (similar to ricotta), creamy but simple guacamole topped with chopped jalapenos and served with totopos (thicker, larger versions of tortilla chips), and a pambazo, a sandwich similar to a torta, stuffed with potatoes, queso, and chorizo and made on soft buns baked in house and then dipped in chile before being fried, giving the huge sandwich an overall red hue.    Our experience was only heightened by the appearance of the chef at the table, a former Mexico City resident who seemingly embodies the matriarchal culinary culture of Mexico.  She was so friendly and welcoming, it made us that much more excited to return to try more of the menu, like their mole poblano and agua frescas.  The interior of the restaurant is simple but nicer than your average Mexican joint, with colorful tablecloths beneath glass tops and black and white photographs of El D.F. hanging on the walls.  Service was extremely friendly but not the swiftest - we had to ask for refills more than once.  And don't expect chips and salsa to arrive on your table when you sit down - it's not that kind of Mexican restaurant, but something more authentic and delicious.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We loved the street tacos. Yum fish and pork were so tasty and good. For and appetizer we had a taco with potatoes, forgot the name but oh so delicious. Normally don't have dessert but pumpkin tamales... What? We couldn't leave with out tasting them. Yes definitely ordering these for the holidays."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food! This was not Sonora Mexican food. This was fantastic Mexico City sopes, street tacos, mole, etc..the chili relleno had a the most delicious salsa on top, and the waitress, whose own mother was the chef, was so down to earth delightful. She suggested the chile nogada which is only available during certain times of the year and on Saturdays--it was like nothing I've ever tasted. The goat cheese sauce was divine. Exceptionally good prices. Overall wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Definitely one of the best new Mexican spots in Phoenix. It's a must try. We tried the Pambazo, Carne Asada Sope, Rajas and Cheese Tamale, Carnitas Tacos, Chicharron Taco and the Quesadillitas. Everything was excellent and authentic. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. When we arrived and were seated with my 10 month old, we asked for a few paper towels. The server told us, \"we don't have paper towels in the restaurant but you can go into the bathroom and gets some there.\" The shrimp ceviche was served with 3 tortilla chips and a plate of saltines. The enchiladas were nothing special and the mushroom and cheese quesadilla was just ok. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"We had delicious carnitas and chilaquiles and Keith the bartender helped us out with wonderful skinny margaritas. So lucky to have a taste of the DF in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So, I believe that service makes food taste better, and the service was exceptional...5 stars."}
{"text":"Found a coupon and decided to try out Escobar's.  It was so good we forgot to use the coupon!  They had a good tequila selection - we opted for Tres Generaciones Anejo.  I agree with a previous reviewer - not sure what region this hails from, but it's not the heavy fare usually associated with Mexican food.  We had street tacos, flautas, ceviche and guacamole.  All is home made, even the tortillas.  All told, the bill was $37.  We held on to a menu to look at the dinner entrees.  We will be back.  What a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was sadly disappointed with this place.  Some work buddies and I chose to try this place on for lunch based on the great reviews.  All three of us left there confused.  I had the street fish tacos and street carne asada tacos.  $2 a piece for thinly sliced over-cooked fish and the carne asada had the consistency of rubber.  One of my co-workers also had the street tacos and was in complete agreement.  My other co-worker got the carne asada and he felt it was very bland.  The tamales were overly dry as well.  We love Mexican food, but unfortunately this place left us wanting."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is not very appealing decor wise but the food was fabulous. I had the tacos and black beans, which were delicious. I did wish they had salsa and chips before the meal but it wasn't a deal breaker."}
{"text":"amazing service, food,atmosphere. .I felt like family the minute I waked in the door. absolutely recommend for group,bday ,family parties!!"}
{"text":"I was \"challenged\" by a friend who lives in the neighborhood to try this local place.  Although we usually ho to another local place on Thursdays this being New Year's Eve we decided to accept the challenge and try something new.  We went to the spot which had ample parking and were greeted and seated right away.  We got a house margarita which was delicious.  A little disappointed and spoiled to not get chops and salsa as we perused the menu.  I decided to go for the chili relleno with rice.  It was terrific - Mexico City style with not tomato-y rice but seasoned fluffy rice.  The chili was filled with cheese and crema all covered with a fresh red sauce.  Terrific.  The hubby got the carne and enchilada combo that came with fabulous refried black beans.  The enchilada was tasty and had sliced avocados.  Yum.  For dessert I got the pineapple tamale which ROCKED and the hubby got chocolate leche cake which was moist and tasty.  A great local find."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and made you feel welcome. The food was good and reasonably priced. The portions are small so you might want to order a side or appetizer with your entree. Overall good experience."}
