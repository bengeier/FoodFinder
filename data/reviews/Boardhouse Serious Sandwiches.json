{"text":"Having the turkey sub.  Very tasty..  First time I've been here and will come back for sure.  Friendly staff and my order came out quick."}
{"text":"I almost hate to do this after seeing how many good reviews they are receiving, but I'm not a fan.  I'll start with what I like - the service and the concept.    1. Both members of the staff were helpful and efficient and gave me recommendations and extra service.  They brought the food to the table and even brought extras which most places would charge you for - extra cheese and cucumbers.  2. The concept is good.  Thick cut veggies, hot and cold sandwiches, a variety of breads.  Soups and chili, too.  After this I'm not impressed.  Part of my problem with this place is that the quality of the ingredients, at least on the day and location, were not particularly good for a custom/\"Serious\" sandwich shop.  I ordered the Turkado sandwich, which had turkey, mayo, shredded iceberg, creamed avocado, and swiss - I substituted cucumbers for the listed tomatoes and red onions - and a cup of the chili with cheese.  The chili was actually pretty good, and I did enjoy it.  When I got the sandwich, it looked great, but after a couple of bites I found the combination rather bland - I guess, what do you expect when all of the components are basically the same color?  I found the avocado was pretty gummy and the turkey was dry - it seemed like they tried to use a roasted turkey, but the effect was dry.  Also, I found the sourdough bread to be more akin to plain white bread than the good stuff that made San Francisco bakeries famous.  It wasn't sour and was far too mushy.  If toasted, the bread could have handled the rest of the sandwich, but, as it was, the bread collapsed during eating.  I think it also contributed to the sandwich not holding together better.  I tried salting the sandwich, but with the mound of poor quality lettuce, there wasn't much hope.  I'd consider giving it a try again, maybe having one of the cooked sandwiches that seem to be the rage with many the reviewers here, but I'd rather have a Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Sunday is 2-for-1 sandwich deal!  I love getting the Grilled Portabella sub. (minus mayo. add lettuce, tomato, jalapeno and sometimes cream cheese) My husband loves the Texas BBQ (substitute portabella instead of beef)  The service is awesome and they will accommodate your substitution request to make their subs vegetarian friendly.  These subs are really good. And for their Sunday deal, you cant beat it."}
{"text":"Seriously, if you don't go here your missing out! I've been going there for a long time and I keep saying I need to write this review. I apologize to them for my laziness. My husband and I love it. Every part of the place is amazing. The sandwich combinations are unique. The ingredients are wonderful from fresh meats and cheeses to the best bread ever. A favorite of ours is the woody knarley style, best hot dog ever! The Duke with the cranberry horseradish too.. yum We usually split, so we get to have two tastes out of one meal. Also, it's important to note the service is great, they always remember us and offer extra personal service for repeat customers. The value is much better than any place I've tried in the same price range. Sadly, it has just about stopped me from going to other sandwich shops period. They all pale in comparison. Try it!"}
{"text":"Got the Woody.....Thanksgiving on bread Excellent!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch last Sunday cause I saw the sign that said 2 for 1 on Sundays for a limited time.   I ordered the Boardhouse Beef Dip ($7.45) and my friend ordered The Pastrami 'Nami($7.95). My sandwich was just ok. Her sandwich was dry and she didn't even eat half.   We both got sodas with our sandwich and the bill was just over $12 with one free sandwich.   I might come back and try something else."}
{"text":"After a hard, sweaty morning charging through the desert on 9/11, I thought I would stop in and give this sandwich shop a go.  After taking a look at the Texas BBQ Beef sandwich, I ordered it.  Combo'd the meal with chips (not really a wide variety to choose from) and a drink (Pepsi products).  Ordered up another sandwich for my boy but all he wanted was a drink and no chips.  Total seemed a tad much for me but if it was to taste good then I would not care.  The sandwich's seemed to take awhile with there preparation but we were  chit chatting and it did not seem to matter that much.  The sandwich came out and I noticed that the Texas was fairly simple in manufacturing that that it was covered coleslaw.  After the first bit I found the BBQ sauce had a sloppy joeish kind of flavor to it and the slaw was very bland.  I ate the whole thing because I was starving.  While waiting for my boy to finish his sandwich, rather tall and obese man walked into the shop.  He bypassed the counter and began scoping me and the other diners out.    His gaze finally settled on me and he approached out table.  He asked me all sorts of questions and then proceeded to throw a napkin with all kinds of words and strange markings on it.  He began telling me his life story be means of incoherent babble all the while asking me for money.  Looking for a polite and no confrontational way to terminate this meeting, I told him that I was not interested and pushed the scribbled on napkin back at him.  He then mumbled to himself and proceeded out another door.  As I cleaned up my table I went up to whom i believe was the manager at the time and sarcastically thanked him for having my back.    He relied back with a \"your welcome\" which set me off.  I told him that I did not appreciate coming into his place of business only to be harassed by some crazy guy.  It was my opinion that a manager should look out for their customers and kick out those that walk and don't order anything and proceed to attempt to intimidate others into giving them money.  In my travels when ever I venture east of Boulder Highway in Henderson, I seem to encounter those freaks that rightly add credence to the term \"Hendertuckey.\"  Rest assured that I will never be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is fine if your in the area and want a sandwich and dont want to walk or drive anywhere else.... and possibly not wanting much of anything better.  I was taken here by a co worker and the food was pretty ... bland i guess?   Bread was nothing special the tuna sandwich was unflavorful and i tried a bite of my friends turkado and that was just like flavored blah in bread?  The one thing i can say was unique and cool about the place is they have chocolate covered frozen bananas.  Which is a pretty unique treat in it's own in vegas.  But not enough to make up for the expensive poor taste in sandwiches.  I vote skip this place and drive to cap's and get a bobbie sandwich around the corner near hard rock."}
{"text":"Their grand opening was today, so we decided to take a lookey.  Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  The atmosphere has a laid back beach/hawaiian feel to it.  The staff was super dooper friendly and helpful.  Most importantly, their sandwiches were fantastic, flavor wise and texture wise and size wise (gi-normous!)!    1.  Class Cheese Steak (HOT SANDWICH) - \"Thin-sliced roast beef sauteed with onions and peppers, smothered in melted Mozzarella cheese on a fresh baked roll.\"  This is right off their menu description.  I couldn't have put it any better!  It was juicy, hot and the roll was soft and fluffy.  2.  The Priva (COLD SANDWICH) - \"Slow roasted hand-pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, cream cheese, lettuce and mayo and a fresh baked roll.\"  The most amazing part of this sandwich was the REAL turkey!  It definitely looked hand-pulled to all the right small pieces.  The perfect amount of cranberry, mayo and cream cheese was in there, on top of the perfectly finely chopped fresh lettuce.  All in all, it was texture-gasmic.  The crunch of the lettuce, with the tangy combination of the cranberr-mayo-creamcheezynes, and the roasty wholesome turkey taste all on a fluffy bun was very satisfying.  p.s.  They have other locations in the valley, and we were informed that they may be opening more.  woot!"}
{"text":"North Vegas has a slew of chain restaurants and some \"just okay\" independent places.  The Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches shop , though, is a winner. Sure, it's pricier than a mediocre Subway.  But taste  wise, you can't compare the fast food mass made subs of one and the seriously made Boardhouse food..   I had the pastrami Nami on rye, and my brother had the turkey.  The pastrami was aromatic and warm, thinly and evenly sliced and lean.  It was placed on very soft, thick rye bread.  With mustard,it was a beautiful, tasty, tall sandwich.  I didn't try the turkey, but my brother didn't say a word the whole time he devoured his sandwich. He said the other sandwiches, from Tuna to roast beef, are all really good.  When in town next time, I hope to try the other items and their cookies. Their featured item on their web homepage is a fat turkey sub with cranberry. It makes me drool...so I always keep a napkin at my computer. I love a place that's all about quality..I just wish they were in the OC."}
{"text":"I had the club sub here, a pretty unamazing sandwich.  The turkey was dry, standard shredded lettuce, and I asked for avocado but got a thin layer of green spread.  I did like that the bread was warm and toasty.  Don't count on your AMEX card working here either-I'm not connected with AMEX or anything but didn't like the cashier's shrill tone when she said they only take Visa or Mastercard."}
{"text":"At first I didn't really like the menu, but temptation grew every time I drove by. So finally, I stumbled in today after stopping by my job to grab something quick and I decided to get a Shortboard Combo (5\" Shorty with ham, turkey, or roast beef; a drink; and a choice of a side for $6.45). I also added shredded mozzarella and thousand island for a bit more, but nothing too steep.  The sandwich was awesome! Granted, there was no way to mess up a sandwich of this caliber, but it still satisfied my taste buds. This is my new favorite place to grab a sandwich and I'll definitely be going back more. I just got the rewards card so it will be worth it even more.  I must say that I also love the decor. A surf-themed sandwich shop in the middle of a desert. Very refreshing to the constant desert palms and what not.  If you enjoy it that much, they also sell shirts, hats, keychains, and necklaces for varying prices.  I'll probably try the Charley Tuna or the Pastrami Nami next."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly.  Lots of good sandwiches to choose from.  I ordered the turkado and it was delicious.  I'll come back to try others."}
{"text":"Sigh.  I used a Groupon Now $5 for $10. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, so perfect opportunity.  I went in around 4pm and no one was there, maybe a sign? I ordered a Turkado combo, with a small potato salad. Total $10.70.. ouch!   They don't have wraps and I believe the only have white bread. It's a thicker type of bread, but similar to bagged bread you can get at the grocery store.   The sandwich had chunks of carved bland turkey, tons of lettuce, a slice of tomato and a smudge of avocado. Can't forget the excessive amount of pepper they finished the sandwich with. Potato salad - mediocre.  Their signature sandwich mocks Capriotti's with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This October they had a buy one get one free sandwich deal, so my partner and I went a few times. I really liked their California veggie sandwich, which had delightfully unexpected sunflower seeds.  My spouse had assorted chicken sandwiches as well as the Charlie Tuna sub and really liked those. I didn't try the chocolate dipped banana but I will in the future, because it reminds me of Arrested Development so much.  The staff is always friendly, and their reward card is a plus!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were just okay.  There are a lot better sandwich shops around town.  I went there because I got a coupon in the mail. 2 for 1.  I dont recommend this sandwich shop unless you are starving and have no place else to go."}
{"text":"I needed a serious pick-me-up during that \"nap time\" hour in the afternoon and decided to try this place for it's serious sandwiches. I peeked at the menu while I was still at work and what sold me was the cream cheese spread they offer on their sandwiches. I'm a big fan of cream cheese on pretty much anything (bagels, sushi, sandwiches) and I pretty much salivated at the thought something new to try incorporating cream cheese. Especially a California-themed sandwich shop.   I chose the Delmar sandwich, which is similar to The Bobbie at Capriotti's (which is like a Thanksgiving dinner in roll of french bread) with an addition of lettuce and the cream cheese spread on it. It was very delicious and filling and It came on two huge slices of whole wheat bread. I didn't really like that the turkey was chopped into tiny pieces making it very difficult to keep inside the sandwich, along with the lettuce, but the redeeming factor was the cream cheese spread.  The turkey was also a bit dry in my opinion, but then again... the cream cheese.   I wouldn't say that cream cheese is like my magic eraser for food-related things but in this case, it definitely made this quick bite to eat a place I'll be returning to in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped by this sandwich shop yesterday for a quick bite before class and was greeted by the friendliest gal you'll ever meet.  She really gets customer service.  She asked if it was my first time there and when I mentioned it was she explained a couple of their most popular sandwiches.  I ended up choosing their veggie sandwich on wheat which was tasty.  I like how they put some type of see on it in the spread which gave it a nice crunch.  The bread was a tad disappointing as that's usually the best part about coming to small sandwich purveyors but nothing that impacted the overall quality.  The place is spacious and very clean.  Like I said, that one gal working there made the experience.  I probably would have given  the place 3 stars but when you hire good people that's worth a little extra in my book.    They also gave me a frequent diner card? that they said accumulates every time I eat there and you can trade in your balances on any occasion for discounts or free sandwiches.    Overall not a bad option for a quick and tasty lunch by UNLV."}
{"text":"And here we go.  Came in here today with a friend looking for some serious sandwiches. Instead, we received seriously cruddy service and retardedly bland food.  Friend ordered a whole Turkado for \"here\" and a whole Delmar \"to go\" for her hubby. I ordered a whole Turkado for \"here\" and a cup of soup \"to go\". Simple.  First she brought to the table 1 half a Turkado. We both looked at our receipts confused and confirmed we both ordered whole sandwiches. We let the girl know and she brought out another half. Confused still we told her we're both still missing a half a sandwich and while waiting starting eating our halves. We both agreed that they tasted extremely bland and was made very sloppy. She than brings another half a Turkado and assures us this equals up to 2 whole sandwiches. No.  She comes back but now with 2 whole sandwiches and tells us that they belong to us until another coworker comes snatching them from the table saying they don't belong to us. Than comes the Delmar which was not wrapped up to go along with another whole Turkado which we switch with one of our untouched halves. This suggestion made her hesitant to actually give us exactly what we ordered. No people we're not attempting to fool you. We just wanted what we paid for. Now that we had our sandwiches I tell them I also ordered a cup of soup to go. Frustrated she tells me she brought it out a while ago and I told her that I didn't want it. What?? When did this happen and why would I turn away a cup of soup I paid for? Finally she brought that stupid cup of soup, dropped a spoon into it and walked away. Really? I walked up to the counter and asked for a lid for my soup and to have the Delmar wrapped to go.  Through this whole experience I said thank you when the sandwich came, when my soup arrived, and even when they handed me the lid at the very end. At no point was there ever an apology. They actually treated it as if it was our fault all these problems were occurring. It was busy but not enough for the whole experience here to go to crap.  In conclusion, pick somewhere that doesn't treat it's customers like shit."}
{"text":"This place beats anyother sandwich store.  The lady was so helpful (u can't miss her, she greets u coming in, has a pierced lip, & gives samples of what she can...she made it 5 stars) The best part of the food was the homemade recipes, they take the ordinary ie tuna & spice it up, add mango chetney. I had the turkey with glazed pecans & it's was great.  Oh ya & it's buy1get1 after 4p.  PS the homemade chili is good"}
{"text":"I like this place. Came here with a couple of my friends. We're from out of town and we were in the area lookin for a place to eat before goin back to over-priced places on the strip. We each got different sandwiches and all of them were good! We were told it was happy hour so we each got a free fountain drink with our sandwiches. Also, the service was great! She gave us recommendations, brought our food to us, and checked up to see how we were doing. Nice place, good portions, and friendly service!!"}
{"text":"I went here after having driven by for a while and I was really surprised by how good it was. I ordered the \"turkado\" which is turkey and avocado, with tomatoes, onions, cheese and mayo. I added creamy horseradish but could barely taste it and will not be doing so next time. But, the turkey was thick and flavorful and actually tasted like meat instead of other places (Subway) where the meat tastes like wet preservatives. I appreciate the generous amount of avocado they put on the sandwich, but I am really getting tired of sandwich shops saying \"avocado\" when really they mean \"smashed avocado spread.\" I like to know what I'm getting, you know? Anyway I will be back but will be getting a half sandwich next time and no creamy horseradish."}
{"text":"Seriously good sandwiches. A little expensive, but a quality sub."}
{"text":"The Philly Cheesesteak was different but good.  It wasn't steak, but roast beef heated.  The bread and cheese were great which balanced out the overall sandwich.    I wouldn't recommend the hot chicken sandwich, it was too strange; with hot and cold making the sandwich lukewarm.  The sauce was so runny the bread got instantly mushy and impossible to eat without making a huge mess.  I ordered it because they didn't have any kind of Italian sub (except a turkey sub with Italian dressing; that doesn't count) and it looked like it would be similar to a Pesto Chicken Parm sandwich; it wasn't.    The peanut butter cookie was overcooked and hard.  They did have good Kettle cooked chips though.    The value was good; for two sandwiches, a cookie, chips, and a drink the total was only $14.  I thought it was fair.    The decor was fun and reminded me of a beach shop in California.    A decent sandwich; I would visit again, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy just really good sandwiches.  We split one large sandwich there (the Woody)  and got another to go (the duke.)  Throughly enjoyed them both.  With drinks the bill was $20"}
{"text":"For a limit of time Boardhouse at this location is offering buy 1 get 1 sandwich after 4pm.  I stopped by this place after hearing from a coworker that this place have something similar to The Bobbie from Capriottis. And I love sammiches so i had to try.    I ordered the Delmar:  Slow roasted hand pull turkey, cranberry sauce, candied pecans, lettuce, mayo, and cream cheese on a thick cut wheat bread.  The candied pecans made the sandwich that must better giving it some extra sweetness to it.  I had ordered it to go, so they wrapped it in a really nice heavy sandwich paper. and labeled it nicely for me.  For my get 1 free I tried their classic cheese steak on the spot.   It was OK.  The steak was thinly sliced but juicy, and the roll it came on was too much.  I peeled most of the bread out just so i can taste some of that steak smother with mozzarella cheese.  It was empty when I came in here, so the place was really clean.  Friendly staff.  Can't beat the b1g1 esp since it's located across the campus next to Einstein Bagels. Doesn't hurt to try.  3.5 out of 4 for me."}
{"text":"My husband had coupons for Boardhouse, which is fairly new and near our house, so we decided to give them a shot for lunch on Saturday. The coupon we had was for two shortboard specials for $9.99. Shortboard specials consist of a sandwich (turkey, ham, tuna or roast beef), side and drink and are usually $6.29 if I remember the menu correctly.   I decided to go with the tuna sandwich and my husband had the turkey. He was offered his choice of mustard, yellow or brown. Otherwise the sandwiches were pretty basic... meat on bread with lettuce, tomato and onion. There were other sandwiches on the menu that looked far more creative and tasty, with toppings like sunflower seeds, mango chutney and cream cheese but alas, they were not eligible for the shortboard combo.   I did like the sub roll our sandwiches were served on. My husband would have preferred wheat bread... Which may have been an option, we didn't ask, nor were were offered bread choices.   We both got potato salad for our side, it was fresh and tasty. They use red potatoes and leave the skins on, which can be a turn off for some people but we didn't mind at all.   Overall I wasn't super impressed, but on the way out we saw a sign that said on Sundays sandwiches are buy one get one free. So I will be back to try one of the more creative sandwiches on the menu on a Sunday in the future.   They also had chocolate covered bananas on the menu, didn't try them but I was tempted!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Talk about some really serious sandwiches, great portions, & obviously some delicious sandwiches. I try to make it out there as much as I can my favorite is the Turkado with delicious slow roasted turkey (the avocado & veggies) on top of delicious sourdough bread. Customer service is always awesome & the restaurant can get packed during lunch so if you stop by for lunch try to get there before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches-Timber's newest experiment with 4 location across the Las Vegas Valley.  First I even heard of this place was an ad I received in the mail. $2.00 off per sandwich, Buy 1 get 1 Free after 4pm and $10 off a $25 purchase on the Weekends. GREAT DEALS!!  The ad had their menu printed on the back and the sandwiches all sounded quite appetizing and a little different variation than you see in most sub shops in Las Vegas.  My 1st attempt at coming here I show up at 10:30 on a Sunday and they didn't open until 1 am so I went elsewhere.  This time it was 4 pm on a Friday and I was hungry so I ordered 3 sandwiches to go. A Beef Dip,A BBQ Beef and a Pastrami Nami.   The cashier was fantastic-very helpful,perky and informative. She said they were owned by Timbers Gaming and had been open since June 2009. Not on twitter yet but a TV commercial airing soon.  The sandwiches are a little pricy $7-8 each -one size fits all.(smaller than a footlong bigger than a size inch)-one type of bread.  The 1st sandwich was the beef dip. Thin roast beef , horseradish and onion. The beef was ok but not real impressive and this was the BEST of the 3 sandwiches.  The 2nd sandwich was the BBQ Beef-same beef as the french dip slathered in bad bbq sauce and some onions thrown in. Nothing memorable here.  The 3rd sandwich was the pastrami-It sure looked good-lots of pastrami-I only made it through half and had the WORST heartburn. It seemed like it had a TON of pepper. Too thin pastrami and it was a little dry and chewy not moist and tender like GOOD pastrami is.  Overall the employees were very enthusiastic, the place had a real cool surfer vibe to it and a simple menu but it's a little too expensive and not impressive at all.  It's nice to see a new place popping up in this economy but I do not have alot of hope for this place -especially this location.   MOST of the customers will be college kids looking to eat cheap and Port Of Subs is nearby."}
{"text":"3.75 stars for Boardhouse Subs. I'm rounding it up to a 4.   I've never been so conflicted when writing a review before. Usually I know when I leave the restaurant what kind of experience I had. I write a pretty fair review, I think, and consider all the factors. So I'm going to break it down and write a long review because of my own internal struggles. Because as I'm writing this, I haven't selected how many stars I'm giving it. I'm going to talk myself into a rating. I've got five categories I'll rate Boardhouse in.  Service - Quick, friendly cashiers never rush you or make you feel like you're an idiot for asking questions. I've only had good things to say about them. In my recent visit I had purchased a deal from LivingSocial off my Iphone. It clearly states on the app that you can print the voucher or bring in your iphone (same way Groupon works). The cashier struggled with this concept, nervous to accept anything but a printout. She balked and nearly refused me use of the credit. She ended up accepting it - good thing she did, because I would have turned around and left... and not batted an eyelash at giving them a one star rating. You simply do not allow your business to be on LivingSocial and not accept a paid-for voucher. But she accepted it after a few moments of hemming and hawing. Good for her.  Quality - On the sandwich scale, about a four (out of five). MUCH better quality than Subway, or even Port of Subs. Not as good as say, Capriotti's or other specialty delis. Equally as good as some of the other 4 star sandwich shops on yelp. The turkey is roasted, sliced thick, breads are yummy, condiments fresh, etc.  Price - Okay, they're overpriced. Even expensive. We picked out two bottled sodas, two bags of chips, and two whole sandwiches (you can choose whole or half portions). He got \"The Original\" with turkey and roast beef (extra charge), normal veggies, and cheese (extra charge). I got the Chicken Bruschetta. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, but before the voucher it came to $24 something. UM, WHAT? We could eat out at a medoicre family restaurant for that. However, last time I was in Port of Subs I remember paying almost nearly this much and I wasn't as impressed... hmmm...   Atmosphere - Adorable, cute little corner shop next to Albertsons. Cute decor, easy to read menu. Frequented by firemen, police, and other blue collar workers. I like this place. Clean, inviting, certainly a place I feel comfortable in.  Return Business - Would I come back? If I was craving a really good hot sandwich, yes. I might gravitate more toward Heidi's Brooklyn Deli on a daily basis because of their price difference... but I'd come back here for a Chicken Bruschetta. With the deal we purchased from LS - hell yes.   Added Bonuses:   *** Kids Menu: Hooray for family-friendly! Three low-priced items on their kids menu.   *** Frozen, chocolate covered bananas.   *** Great bottled drink selection with fountain drink option.  Okay, talked myself into 4 stars."}
{"text":"It is CLOSED!!!  We loved the place.  It was the only sandwich shop in North Las Vegas that offered such freshly made sandwiches.  The people were so friendly.  SAD!!!!"}
{"text":"A sandwich joint that relies on it's faux socal surfer vibe to makeup for it's good but overpriced sandwiches. I'm not sure what's so socal about this place that would separate itself from Capriottis and Subway. Besides the sandwiches with avocado (San Diego staple, y'all!), \"California\" veggie sandwich, and chips from California. It's like any other sandwich place. I wished they had more seafood inspired sandwiches (except for tuna) or a surf and turf sandwich would've been cool. Prices are on the high side, too. $8 for half sandwich, chips, and drink. I'm a cheap college student, duh. I would comeback if they had more specials, otherwise I'll be at Stephano's."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were OK.  Had the Duke with the cranberry mayo and horseradish.  The Horseradish was a little overpowering.  The meat qaulity it OK.  Maybe if I had never come across Jimmy John's or Capriottis I would have ranked them higher.  If I'm in the neighborhood I'd probably go back, just not sure I'd go out of my way for one of them."}
{"text":"Across from UNLV and a meeting place for me & Sweetie for lunch or dinner.  After 3pm (summer only?) it's 2 for 1 on sandwiches.  A huge selection of decent sandwiches."}
{"text":"After working there I know that this company only cares about saving a buck. Recently bought out by a huge corporate name they have done everything they can to save money i.e cutting portion size down completely offering the half sandwich for nearly the price of a whole and saving product well after the expiration date. They have been shut down by the health department numerous times one time for raw sewage backing up on to the store including vents and sanitizer sinks but still continued to operate. Also there is nothing truly vegitarian here becuase everything is processed on and around meat products. they have never followed proper temp procedures and most of the day their line coolers are running around 60-80 degrees because they do not properly cool. If you eat here and get sick you will know why."}
{"text":"My bf saw this place and it reminded us of our days of living in San Diego and guess what it was exactly like a sandwhich shop in San Diego - OVERPRICED and not what you expected.  I was very dissapointed in this place to be quite honest with you. It was a regular sandwhich you could make at home, nothing special. The entire time I was wishing I'd ordered something else or gone to Subway, lets be honest. For the same price we could have gotten 2.5 footlongs and had lunch AND dinner for a few days. Ah well. They send coupons in the fliers pretty regularly but I am just not  tempted to go back yet. maybe in the near future I will give them another try.  The best thing about the sandwich was avocado. but I can buy that nxt door @ Albertson's."}
{"text":"Sundays have now become, my official Yelp day.  I'm going to drive around my area and check out some spots I pass everyday so I have more options to blog about.  Today, a last chance decision brought me to this place, as I go to Albertson's right around the corner.    Walking into this place, let me just say that it seemed promising.  The place is quaint, clean and the \"Hawaiian-hang loose-type\" decor reminds me of home.  \"Why is it that I haven't been here before?\" That's the question I kept asking myself.  I was greeted by a Polynesian-looking girl who took my order.  The menu was mounted on the wall behind her.  I loved the simplicity of choices.  They had hot and cold sandwiches to choose from as well as a kiddie menue.  Here's what I tried:  Pastrami-Nami- Whenever I try out a new sandwich shop, my experience is ALWAYS determined by the type of pastrami sandwich they offer.  This visit was no difference.  Their pastrami-nami said it contains thick cuts of pastrami, sandwiched between two slices of Rye bread, accompanied with brown mustard and cole slaw.  Done and done.  I chose the whole sandwich, Lay's chips and a soda.    Uhh...maybe the ambiance would have made my sandwich experience better.  I decided to take my lunch home so I could get an unbiased opinion of the sandwich and not persuaded by the ambiance LOL.  The only thing I could say was that I've have much better experiences with pastrami sandwiches...like from Subway.  True, the pastrami was thick, but dry.  The Rye slices were super thick and not a combo I would have chosen for my sandwich.  The cole slaw was premade and tasted a little old, to me.  In other words, I've had better.  Thank goodness for the mustard, or that sandwich would have been a complete bust for me.  To top it off, the entire meal, counting tip, was about 13 dollars!  A little excessive for a mediocre experience.  To be completely fair, there was a nice size crowd in this place.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying each other's company and the restaurant.  I really appreciate it when a business creates such an ambiance.  If I ever decide to re-visit this place, I will decide to eat my sandwich within the restaurant.  I truly believe that your surroundings sometimes has an effect on your overall experience, including the taste.  I will also try another sandwich that caught my eye on the menu: the Ranch Club Chicken with added Avocado."}
{"text":"the sandwiches here are good, but they're just not great. I think I just don't like their offerings, and honestly I don't want to create my own.   I will say that Earthquake chips are absolutley amazing, and I recommend you have them as soon as possible."}
{"text":"It was only edible because I was so hungry after class. How does a tuna sandwich have a honey BBQ sauce?? gross.... I prefer Jimmy Johns"}
{"text":"Their Italian turkey sub is great. Service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon--10.00 for 20.00.  Wasn't worth it if you have to pay full price.  We had 1 cheesesteak, 1 delmar (turkey and cranberry on wheat), and 1 grilled cheese for my son.  We also order a small cup of soup and a bag of chips.  Total came out to 24.00, so actually I paid $14.00.  Sandwiches were ok but nothing great.  No frills....I'd prob prefer port-a-sub and then maybe subway.  Again ok sandwiches but for the price....nah.  Chips are 1.45 a bag (kinda expensive).  Btw they no longer have their rewards program....we were told by the cashier."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out since I heard this place is good.   I decided to be safe and order the Boardhouse Original, a simple sandwich, and I selected turkey for it.  The turkey isn't the cheap processed deli turkey, it is actual sliced turkey.  The delicious one-of-a-kind hoagie roll they use was excellent, combined with their mayo lettuce and tomato, this was a super sandwich!  Sounds simple, but when you have a quality sub like this, you will taste the difference immediately.  During my lunch time visit, I found this place full and near capacity, having to grab the last table available to me. During my meal,  I was confidently asked by an employee how everything tasted.    The atmosphere is approaching a surf shack feel, but falls a bit short on the overall feel.   I hope they decorate it alot more with beach stuff, and don't hold back!  I feel that wood flooring in the dining area would be a nice addition..  Just continue with the theme, because this place should be around for a long time, if they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't more popular, though at the same time its location is a little conspicuous by campus (and I originally assumed it was a skate shop!)  Went here for the first time after working out looking for a place that wasn't greasy fast-food, but then again a place that had sandwiches that were unique and different from all the other chains around the UNLV area.   Hands down, this is a new favorite! They've got some very healthy conscious choices on their menu, and their sandwiches really do make up for the price you pay (usually $5-$8 for them, but you get a filling portion and they are absolutely delicious!) The California Veggie sandwich is my favorite (because you typically don't see sandwiches out there with alfalfa sprouts on them!), and of course the Sunday 2-for-1 sandwich deal is pretty unbeatable for great sandwiches like these!  Highly recommended for those looking to stray away from all the typical fast food restaurants out there. This place is quick, a nice sit down for lunch, and their sandwiches are unique! Service is beyond excellent!"}
{"text":"By far... this place kicks ass when it comes to great sandwiches in and around the UNLV area. Although the prices are a a bit high, they do make up for it in sheer size. Mind you, this is not exactly the place to come if your on a diet as these sandwiches (at least the ones I order) would make any personal trainer wince.   Between this place and capriotti's across the street, they have the sandwich market around UNLV pretty well covered."}
{"text":"I actually reviewed Boardhouse awhile back...but I reviewed the one on Maryland Pkwy....while this is actually the one I frequent. This place has delicious sammiches! I usually ALWAYS get the Charlie Tuna. It is the tastiest tuna sandwich I have EVER eaten. Seriously. I go here quite often. It's an albacore tuna salad and there is a mango chutney that comes on the sandwich that is so, so good. The slight sweetness of the chutney blends well with the saltiness of the tuna, finishing with a little bite from the black pepper they shake on top. Not to mention the crunch of the lettuce and the freshness of the tomato...HEAVEN! I never thought any type of fruit with tuna would be tasty...but I went with it and tried it. I did learn the hard way though that if you order the Shortboard Combo you have to ask for mango chutney on the sandwich (an additional 50 cents, but well worth it). Also, when you order the combo it comes on a soft sub roll. If you order just the sandwich it comes on thick cut wheat bread. Go with the sub roll...even if you decide to order just the sandwich...go with the sub roll. It's nice and soft in the middle with a slightly chewy crust. With the sandwich I usually get the potato salad. It's actually pretty good. It's a mayonnaise base (no mustard), with I think dill. I've gotten the coleslaw before, but it's really kind of bland, not bad - just lacking a lot of flavor. Sad, because I usually love coleslaw. The total for the combo, with the potato salad, is always $7.51.  I've also tried their California Veggie sandwich. It's avocado, cucumber, sunflower seeds, monterey jack cheese, sprouts, tomato, red onion, and cream cheese on that thick cut wheat. It was okay...I don't particularly like that bread, so i think it would be better on the sub roll.   Every time I bring back my food to work I convince another person to try Boardhouse and they love it. Most of the meat eaters I know get the Chicken Bruschetta and say it's basically life-changing (okay, so they didn't REALLY say that...but they act like it). It's a warm sandwich top with grilled chicken, bruschetta, melted mozzarella, and pesto mayo.  You won't be disappointed....it's a MUST try! OH, and lest I forget, they have a rewards card that allows you to earn \"cash\" towards sandwiches every time you order!! I actually had enough points to get myself a free combo meal for lunch today!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Boardhouse for the first time today due to fantastic reviews on yelp and...they were right!!! This place has delicious sammiches! I had the Charlie Tuna, and while it was quite tasty it didn't have the mango chutney on it (hence the 4 stars). That was a little disappointing as that is the whole reason I got the sandwich...but alas, mangoes probably aren't in season right now. My co-worker got the Chicken Bruschetta and said it was basically life-changing (okay, so he didn't REALLY say that...but he acted like it). I got the coleslaw too and that was a little on the bland side, not bad per se, but not full of flavor. All in all I would say this place is fantastic and a definite must to try (I patronized the Boardhouse located on Craig in North Las Vegas)...you won't be disappointed.  UPDATE (25 AUG): Got the Charlie Tuna again...this time it had the mango chutney and it was AWESOME!! Definitely a perfect flavor to off set the saltiness of the tuna...unfortunately the bread was different this time. It was on whole wheat loaf bread, as opposed to the hoagie type wheat bread (which was WAY better btw)...either way - a MUST try! OH, and lest I forget, they have a rewards card that allows you to earn \"cash\" towards sandwiches every time you order!!  OH - so I finally figured out that when you get the short board combo for the tuna it comes on the sub roll, not when you order just the sandwich. Also, if you ARE getting the short board combo you have to ASK for the mango chutney (50 cent charge)."}
