{"text":"I decided to try this place out as it was the only viet place around the area and I was craving pho.   The pho was done extremely poor as the broth was very salty and dark which from first look you can tell its not very \"traditional\". The beef was super over cooked and aside from that I don't really remember much about it. For $9 (small) I can really find much better pho basically.  My friend ordered a pad Thai instead which looked pretty decent."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch if you work in the offices around the area. Tends to get super busy around that time, so call in advance to make a reservation if you can. The lunch specials aren't bad for their price points but nothing spectacular. Definitely not my go-to Thai/Viet place but with it's location, it's convenient for those times at the office when you're looking for something oriental for lunch."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been to this location multiple times. I always order the green thai curry because it is delicious! I have come here with multiple colleagues who have ordered various dishes off the menu and always found them enjoyable.  This location is always busy especially during lunch time so making a reservation is highly recommended. The management/servers could be more friendly. They also seem to have issues with the concept of \"individual bills\". If you are on a time crunch, this could cause some delays."}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant & my group really enjoyed the \"All You Can Taste\" dinner menu! Nice variety of items.   The Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai was light, spicy & delicious. I enjoyed all of their appetizers, especially the yam & shrimp tempura, chicken lettuce wraps, and spring rolls. The sushi was fine.  Just note the service is not great. They didn't bring a number of items I ordered (including water, even after asking for it twice), and service was a bit inattentive & not very friendly.  Fun place though! Nice dining room & concept."}
{"text":"Fantastic veg. dishes, I've tried the golden, red & green veg curries as well as the sweet and sour veg. All are excellent but the green curry is very spicy and the red is less but still rather spicy. Prices are higher than average but well worth it given the quality and flavour!"}
{"text":"Crazy good thai food...couldn't figure what to order, the waiter offered to surprise me.  What followed was a couple appetizers and an entree that were immaculately prepared and tasted beautiful.  The staff were constantly keeping the tables in order, and the cleanliness was very refreshing.  Best Thai I've had in Canada!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars - Really a hit or miss here. Be warned that during lunch hour it gets quite busy due to the surrounding office building. I'm undecided on the food. All I can say is that it is inconsistent. Some days, I would get great tasting dishes here and other times, not so much. Sadly, I would say that  this is one of the better Thai/Vietnamese restaurants around the area (much better than Jasmine).   My suggestion is to come at an off-time (either early or late lunch), this way, you will experience better service and hopefully better food as well."}
{"text":"Went for the \"All you can taste\" menu which is bull honky, because I'm not here to taste, I'm here to EAT!!!  Decor is quite swanky (completely unlike its neighbour Mandarin) and I also like this place because it's a fusion of Thai and Japanese which is a unique combo.  *Sushi/sashimi/maki/ all pretty decent.  I'd say it was average.   *Thai curries (especially red curry) are all excellent. *Beef in peanut sace, fish in curry sauce were delectable!  *Try the lettuce wraps-really surprisingly good for an AYCE *And like the others, the bangkok street pad thai was quite good although a bit too sweet for my taste.  They lost one star for not having free refills (I figure pop should be a freebie refill since it fills you up faster, hence you eat less--hehehe), and because there is no dessert included with your \"taste\" menu.  After all that food, one needs just a bit of sweet to let the taste buds know that the meal is officially over!"}
{"text":"Usually they have great food but today was a bad experience. There was egg shells and clear plastic casing in my meal. I'm sure it was just a off day for the cook."}
{"text":"The food here is OKAY but the ambience is good. The servers are attentive too.  I usually go here at lunch time with my colleagues. They have a nice and short lunch menu, which is good because we can select our dishes quickly. Then their service is kinda quick too, so you can eat a good lunch at a reasonable price in your limited lunch time."}
{"text":"Went there with my team. Food is alright but service sucks. The server was not patient with my friend while she was deciding what to eat. The server did not wait 10 seconds and they gave me pork which I can not eat. Took a long time for them to bring the check even though it wasn't busy. 2.5/5 for me."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now over the past 18 months and the food is consistently good, not great, but good.   I've had all of the curries red, green and yellow and my favorite is the yellow but without the onions :)  I've always taken my food to-go and it usually only takes them about 10 minutes or so to put the order together.  Their curries are a little thinner then what I'm use to in the States, the spiciness is good and the chicken is always tender.  Today, I went with my colleague Jasen for lunch and wow, it is crazy at lunchtime!  I tried their Thai Chicken Saute and it was pretty good, I really liked the peanuts they added to the top as well as the crispy basil leaves.  Never had crispy basil leaves before!  Not bad!  The staff is always nice.  The interior is nice and modern.  I would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"As a business traveller, I look for conveniently located restaurants that offer quality food. I try not to go crazy with my expenses so price does matter. Spoon and Fork on Eglinton fits the bill, especially for lunch. The spring rolls are very good, the lunch entrees are flavourful and plentiful (Pad Thai and Curries come to mind). From a genuine Thai taste prospective, the food is light on flavors associated with Thai food, hence the 3 stars. I think they try to please everyone and it works judging by the crowds. Good place to keep in mind if you are close by.   Aps 3.5/5  Lunch entrees: 4  Dinner Entrees: 3.5  Beverage (variety/Price): 3.5  Price: 3.5 (although, you are getting what you paid for)"}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best red curries I've ever tasted!  And I've tried a lotttt of places.  I'm staying at a hotel near the airport and was in the mood for Thai.  This place was close by so I drove over.  From the outside I wasn't impressed but upon walking inside it was a nicer feel.  I was able to order the red curry with chicken to go even though it wasn't on the take out menu.  Received my food quickly and went back to the hotel.  Immediately upon opening it it smelled so good and I was so hungry I didn't get a picture LOL.  The curry sauce was delicious, the chicken was probably the best cooked chicken in curry I've ever had, and the pineapple was a nice touch!  If I had a critique I would say I wish it had more variety of vegetables like maybe bamboo or bell peppers.  It was a good portion too!  It's a bummer I can't have the left overs tomorrow since I'm leaving first thing in the morning.  I wish this place was in San Diego!  If I'm ever back in Toronto I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Spoon and Fork. Most of the food was amazing with very complex flavors. Unfortunately I started with the Cold Mango Roll and the mango was not ripe. It didn't have much flavor. The dipping sauce that accompanied it was tasty. Next I had the Soft Shell Crab. It was a large potion for an appetizer and was probably the best I've ever had. I order it whenever it is on a menu. The seasoning added to the crab flavor without overpowering it. For an entree, I had the BBQ duck. A large portion of smoked duck breast with Chinese fruits in a interesting orange curry. Kind of spicy but different from anything that I have ever had. My only regret is that I do not live near this restaurant. I would love to come back and try some of their other dishes. I am just staying in a nearby hotel."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome, but the food is even better!   This is a very small location (I've been to the S&F+ in Oakville which is much bigger) but they are very efficient in optimizing space and providing food for as many customers as possible. This is a very popular spot at lunch time during the week, so either make reservations before, or arrive before 12pm - otherwise you could (and probably will) be waiting a while to get a table.  You must try the Pumpkin Curry Soup here - delicious. The spring rolls are also some of the best I've had. And my go-to dish is the Red Curry Chicken - the perfect meal and you will NOT leave hungry (warning: the soup is heavy and is sometimes enough for some people as a meal)."}
{"text":"One of the better Thai food restaurants I've been to. I highly recommend the lemongrass fried rice, very tasty! Takeout is also very fast and convenient. VERY BUSY AT LUNCH TIME. It is a little pricier but for good taste i don't mind paying the extra. Great little secret of the Etobicoke area!"}
{"text":"Went for supper last night with a couple of friends and it was delicious! We all had different versions of curry, mine being the green vegetable curry and we all felt the same way. Now the place was completely empty which surprised me on a Friday night but it was early when we went. The service was also extremely friendly and efficient. Absolutely would recommend this place to anyone and I love my Thai food!"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. Lots of options, fast (aggressive) service, nice renovations, always very busy at lunch Not necessarily the most authentic dishes. But it does the trick as there are not many Asian food options in this area.   I've tired a few different dishes. And I personally like the curries most."}
{"text":"Food and service was very mediocre. In fine company, we had an informal lunch meeting here. Wait staff interrupted us mid-sentence, a couple of times, to rush our order. I ordered Thai yellow curry served with coconut rice. The food came fast. Served first was the wonton soup. My grief with this soup is, if you can't do it properly, might as well not. The broth was lacking flavor though seasoning is okay. The wonton filling was tough and rubbery. The bok choi and mushroom did not seem to be cooked, just light blanched and thrown in as an afterthought. It added little character to the soup itself and threw the texture balance of the soup way off.      Next to be served was the entrée. Presentation was simple a bowl of curry and coconut rice molded be a bowl on the side. The coconut was average. Not as fragranced as some other places, and quite heavy. The curry was on another playing field. It was unpalatable. The curry itself was like a dessert - overwhelmingly sweet. The sauce was so overwhelming that it destroy any nature taste of the beef. In this case, I might actually count it as a silver-lining. The beef pieces (that weren't drowned in the dessert glaze that was their curry had an off-putting tainted taste to it). May not have either been fresh or stored properly.  Overall, nothing was much off a win except for the company of my colleagues. Not a place I would send any of my executives to for their meetings. I did enjoy some of their other locations, but this one need an overhaul."}
{"text":"At first glance, looks like a decent place for lunch or dinner  menu is extensive,  price is fair  Taste is off for dishes I tried whether Thai, Viet, Japanese  Been here a handful of times and not a favorite  Staff not pleasant, will not be returning"}
{"text":"Priced too high but good tasting food and they're quick to get food to the table, which is great for short lunch breaks. Drink menu is not that great though."}
{"text":"Mediocre, bland tasting Thai food, that fits in well with the bland and suburban neighborhood it is in. I ate here because my client who works across the street chose it. I would definitely not venture back unless in the same situation again. Nothing was bad, but nothing was good, special, or food that a person from Thailand would call delicious. Moreover, the Tom Kha Gai (coconut chicken soup) was the worst I have tried anywhere in the world and was quickly pushed aside.   Decor isn clean and modern.   Service was good, prompt."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident while wandering around in the rental car. Great lunch menu! Excellent prices, good portions, very nice and clean restaurant. Well done."}
{"text":"Co-worker and I stopped in for Pho for lunch. Busy as heck but there was 1 table open when we got there, thank god.  The pho was good! We had some ginger honey tea and the basic beef pho, and both were very yummy. Prices were good, service was friendly and fast.   Will be going back for sure! Like others said, best to go a bit before or after noon hour."}
{"text":"Great food always friendly staff except if your there for the lunch rush around 12 its a zoo ! But the best tom yum soup ever and their Corn soup is amazing as well all around nothing I have ever ordered has tasted bad everything has been excellent !"}
{"text":"This place is fusion and not authentic Thai and Vietnamese. However, it is good. We ordered ginger duck thinking that it was a chopped up quarter of a steamed or roasted duck. It is actually smoked duck. If you're not expecting Chinese style duck then this is good. The basil beef was pretty good. Our favourite is the lamb satays. It is tender and tastes like real satay. The ambiance was the best out of the whole experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! We had spring rolls, hot and sour soup, the Bangkok pad Thai and basil shrimp. Everything was really yummy and satisfying. The service was also extremely friendly and efficient. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Okee dokee folks... here it is, work near YYZ?  Don't have a ton of time for lunch?  Have a thing for Asian food?  Well...Spoon & Fork can fill that lunch hankering :-)  I recently visited Toronto for business and was in the Mississauga area, by Eglinton...and had a craving for Asian food!  Instead of driving all over the GTA, this lovely joint was minutes away.  I had heard mixed reviews from my fellow team mates, but had to try it out for myself.    We arrived just after noon and were quickly seated (4 total).  Now, I'm all about fast service, but the waiter seemed to think we could read the entire menu in the seconds it took us to literally take out seats.  After we had 5 minutes to review the menu (and being asked twice if we were ready), I landed on Basil Fried Rice (with chicken).    Aside from aggressive waiters, our food only took minutes to prep, cook and materialize on our table.  Seriously...woah.  I love my rice and this dish wasn't bad, not the best, but definitely filled my craving.  Power wok cooked with large chunks of chicken, sliced onions/peppers and a mild spice (maybe too hot for some?!).    Pricing wasn't terrible ($10CAD), fast service and free parking yo!"}
{"text":"A VERYYY GOOD RESTAURANT! clean simple interior design with professionally plated food. The price is reasonable with the amount and quality of the food! A definite must if your in the area. The owner is very amicable and the curry and crab are definite try!"}
{"text":"My husband used to work near this Spoon & Fork location (on Eglinton) for years and visited it quite regularly.  He got to know the owner and some of the servers and, even when I met them, they were just lovely people.  On a lot of Friday nights he would bring home dinner and, in my opinion, the food was always fresh, authentic, tasty and made with pride.  The calamari was cooked to perfection - very tender but crispy (not greasy) on the outside.  I could eat a whole platter if my stomach allowed me!  The Vietnamese spring rolls are a must try - something I've never had before.  I've only ever had the Pad Thai and Curry Pad Thai and they are amazing - noodles cooked el dente, right amount of sauce and all fresh ingredients - they also make a crazy hot homemade sauce that's very flavorsome but extremely hot; one time it even burned through the container.  My husband usually would get the seafood green curry - I thought it wasn't bad but, for my taste buds, very fragrant.  He would mostly get the Pho Seafood, which is only offered at lunch and pretty much dirt cheap, and bring it home sometimes.  I'm not a huge fan of Pho but, compared to others, I thought it reigned supreme.  It's a nice, little, charming restaurant that would be great for an intimate dinner.  I know it gets crazy busy at lunch though - it you like Thai food, give it a try as it won't disappoint; even you wallet will like it!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. A portions are big. It's fairly priced. But it's kind of misleading. I've been to the Oakville location before where they serve all you can eat sushi. Then I came to this location and they didn't. I think they should rethink about serving sushi here or change their name entirely."}
{"text":"they used to serve spicy peanuts as soon as you sat.  They were the best peanuts ever.  Now they don't have them and the food is ok.  It is packed during lunch time, and they do accept reservations.  Dinner is less busy"}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it is in a pretty sketchy looking strip mall, but the food and service were good. Ordered the Thai spring rolls and Thai pad Thai. Both were good. Not the best I've had but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Warning: Located between a bunch of office complexes, so lunchtime gets pretty busy.  Ordered the squid salad and pho shrimp. The squid salad was in a delicious sauce with mangoes, onions and bell peppers. Ate it all except for the excessively chewy squid, which I gagged on a few times. The pho was good as well, not too salty. Overall, the food was good, but nothing to rave about. Service was wicked fast and friendly though, really appreciated that."}
{"text":"Possibly the best shrimp Pho I ever had. Great tasting broth and loaded with shrimp and veggies.  Better have a reservation for lunch or come early as tough to get a seat at noon just walking in.  Service is very good with staff attentive, fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and this place was walking distance from my hotel so i decided to try it for dinner.  Service was fine, as I was seated and had my order taken promptly.  The entree was pretty good overall - warm glass noodles with mixed vegetables and tofu.  The flavors worked well together, but it was a bit lacking on both the tofu (only 4-5 pieces) and the mushroom (only 2 pieces).  Still, I would order it again.  Unfortunately, i made the mistake of getting the mango coconut sticky rice for dessert.  The mango was not even close to ripe, and actually quite hard.  It should never have been served.  Also, the dish was not entirely sticky rice, as at least half was some sort of purple rice.  It should have been all sticky rice.  Quite a disappointing dessert.  Combine the good entree with poor dessert and you get 3 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to this Spoon and Fork a couple of times. The first was taking a couple of colleagues from Sweden here for lunch on their last day with us. I went there yesterday with my team to welcome a new hire and welcome back a colleague from an injury.   Both times, we made reservations. We were a group of eight people the first time. Yesterday, we were six.   I was the only one on my team who made this suggestion to come to this restaurant. Everyone overwhelmingly voted to come here and ditched my manager's suggestion!  Food orders come out fast. I liked the mango salad the first time that I was there. I think that the mango could be more ripe, but that's just me. It was still yummy and refreshing.   Yesterday, I ordered the red Thai curry. I felt like a dish with coconut milk in it. This fish was perfect. The curry was fragrant with a bit of heat. The pineapple and chicken complemented each other. I are all my coconut rice by drenching it in the curry sauce.   I have loved the food here the couple of visits here. I'd recommend coming here for good food that is served quickly.   (215)"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! We were looking for Mexican but ended up here. Really awesome service, amazing food. Will come back!"}
{"text":"The appies were good but nothing out of the ordinary.  For lunch I had the Green Curry Chicken which had a good spicy punch to it.    What stopped this from being a 3 star review was the staff.  They seemed to just want to push you through so they could get an extra flip on the table before the lunch rush was over.  Because there was a big group of us that wasn't happening.  The staff was short and to the point; here's your food, eat it and get out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch and was seated promptly. Both the soup and Traditional Pad Thai were tasty and temperature hot. The Pad Thai had a little spice but definitely not overwhelming.   Servers were attentive and I was in and out in :25 min. By myself so not much conversation to be had, hence the quick turn.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for business and ate at Spoon & Fork.  So delicious! The pad thai was the perfect amount of spicy and all the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant if I'm ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.  Went here for lunch one day since I work nearby.  Food was for me but the place was packed loud and cramped.  Next time I would go takeout.  Prices seemed about average."}
{"text":"Have eaten lunch here many times.  The Thai dishes are tasty, always just the right amount of lemongrass, coconut, peanut, garlic and other essential flavour profiles.  The protein portions are generous, and the vegetables are never overcooked.  If looking for a lunch, arrive early as it's very busy from 12 to 1.  Clean, tidy dining room and efficient staff who don't hover."}
{"text":"In the barren land that is Mississauga, your food options can sometimes be limited, especially if you're working 9-5 with a very short lunch break.   I work for a pretty big company and that means every week it's either a birthday, promotion, retirement, or something else that requires an Outlook invite and a nearby restaurant that can seat many and pump out food quick. Unfortunately, the only recurring option we're presented with is Spoon and Fork.  Now, I don't know about their other locations, but any restaurant owned by Chinese people that attempts to serve pad thai AND pho is definitely not that authentic, one dish or another. And guess what?! Both these dishes are not great here. Ok ok - it's not like their food isn't edible, I don't want to scare you, but don't have any expectations of having an incredible lunch here.   If you're trapped in Mississauga and are craving Asian food AND Spoon and Fork is the only location opened? I think you should consider eating something else instead lol."}
{"text":"Went there to have their Pad Thai, the waitress recommended I take the Bangkok Street Pad Thai instead because I didn't like spicy food.  Service was above average, food quality was also above average, but so was the price.  I got the Bangkok Street Pad Thai with Vegetables and Tofu, felt like veggie tonight.  It was portioned just right, not too much and not too little.  However, there wasn't really much room for dessert once the food had settled in.  At $11 + taxes and tip for the dish, it is more than what I would normally want to pay for, but the extra money did show for their service, cleanliness (aside from the one fly that seems to be plaguing them forever, they may have been keeping it as a pet) and food quality.  No free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I was entertaining a colleague from out of town and wanted to wow him. This place exceeded my expectations in terms of food quality. Service was superb. Calamari salad as an appetizer was very satisfying with an amusing kick. Golden Curry with shrimp was absolutely delicious. (And I typically don't care for curry very much). Glad I made reservations for lunch as it got quite busy. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place reeks of delicious aromas! I've been to a few different locations, this one is a bit small but the wait for us on our lunch hour was thankfully short. I ordered the green curry with chicken and my colleagues ordered the red curry and stir fried ginger beef.  The curry is well seasoned and the balance between sweet, spicy and tangy is spot on. I've always had a great experience eating here.  Excellent Thai cooking in the city!"}
