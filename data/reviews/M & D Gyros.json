{"text":"My favorite place. It has great food and service. The gyros there are absolutely astonishing."}
{"text":"The Special (Chicken Shawarma) is a nice sized portion for low price.  Excellent Hummus.  They have Vegetarian Wraps available.  

The owner is very professional and friendly.  The food is halal /kosher and seasoned well.  You can watch your food being prepared in the kitchen area.  We were given hummus to try, which was really delicious.  

The mall is not busy, therefore the food court is rather empty. No waiting in line. However, food is prepared fresh,  therefore allow a few minutes to be served."}
{"text":"Really good gyros and shwarma. Made fast but not too fast. Good pricing and hot food!"}
{"text":"Food is average at best.  Most of it is pre-prepared and frozen stuff, but still somewhat acceptable.  My issue is that they either are trying to mislead you, or the owner doesn't understand the promotional strategies that he signed up for.  I use restaurant.com vouchers all the time from restaurants that use their discount vouchers.  So I went a few days ago I had a $15 discount voucher.  My bill total was $30+ so my net cost should have been around $15.  The owner kept telling me that the voucher allowed for a 25% discount.  When I protested, he finally relented and offered a 40% discount.  That was still wrong since 40% of $30 is only $12 so he was shorting me $3!  I will never recommend these guys and I will never return to do business with a crooked establishment."}
{"text":"The chicken shwarama sandwich is amazing! The cashiers there are so nice and the the food is made fast! You should go there too and try all different kinds of food they have!"}
