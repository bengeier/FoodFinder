{"text":"Let me preface by saying I love Park and Point Brugge, but my first experience here was just ok. The first problem was they were understaffed for brunch, how does that happen less than a week after you open. The mussels which at the other locations are always on point, but this time were cold and missing the chorizo that was in the description. Then the entree poutine was missing the pork lardons, one of the main reasons for getting the dish. I work in the service industry, so I understand working out the kinks, but you can't miss that many points and still get great marks. It is week one , but you should have most of these things corrected by the time of your opening week."}
{"text":"If you love Point Brugge or Park Bruges, this is your place!  We started with roasted sunchokes, accented with melted raclette--finally found raclette in Pittsburgh!  Also tried the goat cheese app, crispy on the outside, with a slightly sweet sauce on top, on a bed of basil pesto.  Both delish!

Kept it simple and went for two different kinds of moules frites.  A.mazing.  A generous portion of mussels, cooked perfectly, but the sauces... oh the sauces!  Two pieces of baguette aren't sufficient, but they'll bring you more, or you may just decide to live in the remaining sauce.  It's that good. 

Nice lively crowd for a weekday lunch... more than the late Casellula.  But Brugge is a known quantity, so that may help put butt in the seats.  The quality of the food and above average service will keep them coming back.

Welcome to the North Side! We're thrilled"}
{"text":"The high quality you would expect from the Brugge family of restaurants. Really happy to have it in the neighborhood and fill a niche that was lacking. The mussels and white sauce are incredible. Ask for a second plate of bread. Poutine was hearty and the duck two ways was flavorful and moist. The bar tending staff is experienced, friendly, and talkative. Great first experience!"}
{"text":"So happy my favorite mussels are now closer to home! Was worried they wouldn't be the same but they were excellent! We started with the cheese plate and my dining companion and I also split the chopped salad and added salmon. The dressing that came with it was delicious. The mussels of course was the main dish ! Our server Ashley was good. They are still working out some kinks but it wasn't anything major. Food came out correct and timely. I can't wait to go back for my mussels fix."}
{"text":"We went in with high expectations based on what we have heard of the sister restaurants. We were there for a private dinner, and our service was quite good although one server for a party of 12 makes it hard for her. She kept up for the most part. Throughout our party we ordered almost every entree on the menu and multiple types of mussels. The consensus was that the onion soup, agnolotti, steak frites, mustard greens, and the mussels (of all things) were terrible. The only good comments of the evening were for the charcuterie plate, the duck, and the creamed spinach.  Multiple people said their food was bland and under seasoned and every red meat dish was cooke 2 levels below what was requested. The cuts of meat for the steak frites were not good or not properly prepared to have zero crust and only a gray, fatty edge, almost as if they were cooked from frozen. I don't think they were, just not a great cut. All in all, disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Point Brugge Caf√©, and this addition to the family doesn't disappoint. I stopped by for Sunday brunch, and even though it's a new restaurant the place was bustling. I made it before the rush but there were definitely multiple parties after us that were told there would be a wait. However, this place has a bar and is connected to a cool bookstore so the wait won't be too bad unless you're super hungry!

I tried the Eggs Benedict and the Poutine. The Eggs Benedict came with carne asada (beef) and cilantro scallion hollandaise atop corn cakes. The eggs were perfect and the carne asada was delicious as well. However it wasn't my favorite spin on Eggs Benedict that I've had, and the sauce took a little getting used to. I personally probably wouldn't choose to order it again, but it was still a nice experience and a fun combination. On the other hand, I knew the Poutine couldn't go wrong because I knew their fries were going to be delicious! Very flavorful and filling dish. If you're super hungry and don't mind feeling a little guilty I would definitely recommend the Poutine.

Didn't have any problems with the service!"}
{"text":"Reviewing because even though we did have some kinks in service while visiting the first weekend the waiter we had was super apologetic and obviously that's just what you walk into as staff gets into the groove of a new space. Even if it was a little slow paced, it didn't really affect our dinner: we had wonderful drinks, the food was great (I had to try the curry mussels because Point Brugge's are my favorite in the city and now they are tied) and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. We ordered the vanilla ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dessert and it was wonderful... can't wait to try to the rest of the menu and obviously will be back because I know service will just get better from here."}
{"text":"Same great food you would expect from Point Brugges or Park Brugges. Plus a great staff assembled from the other restaurants.

The cheese plate is one of best in Pittsburgh, with a great selection of artisan cheeses.

There's a good wine list, and some wonderful local beers on tap (Grist House and East End, for example).

Our server was new, of course, but she was helpful and attentive. 

To top it off, they have a marvelously talented pastry/dessert chef. 

We enjoyed a great dinner here and expect you will, too."}
{"text":"If you love point and park bruges then you'll love this new location as well. I went opening night and enjoyed a kiwi cocktail, the signature tomato based mussels and a small plate of fried chevre with pesto. It did not disappoint, like it ever does! Chet the bar manager is kind, personable and will make your dining experience a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant! This is in a shared space with City of Asylum. When we were finishing our dinner a jazz concert was starting- so cool! 

The menu is similar to the other \"Brugge\" restaurants and the food and service were both very good. Our server was very attentive to all of our needs and special requests. The price point is pretty good as well; a little lower than similar quality restaurants in town. 

The sunchoke small plate was perfectly cooked and accompanied my delicious cheese and pesto. The salmon entree was also very good- the sauce and farro risotto were amazing! The greens side that came with it was only okay. I also had the North Mule cocktail, which was amazing. One of the best versions of a mule I've had."}
{"text":"Good food. Fun space. Large portions. Very excited to have a nice restaurant on the north side."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We went on Mother's Day for brunch, and everybody ate their food super fast!! The portions are generous and it's not too pricey. I had the eggs benedict which was fantastic!!!! The corn cakes were soft (but not mushy) and the carne asada was juicy and delicious. The eggs were poached nicely and the scallion hollandaise added the perfect touch too. For dessert, we had the lemon rose cheesecake and the chocolate cake. The lemon rose cheesecake was unlike most of the cheesecakes I've had before- it was fluffy, not dense. The lemon curd was superb! The chocolate cake- HEAVENLY, A CHOCOLATE LOVER'S PARADISE, AND PHENOMENAL. It was my favorite dessert. The peanut butter buttercream and the chocolate was so rich and decadent. All in all, I had a wonderful experience here and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have been to both Park Brugge and Pointe Brugge and enjoyed them them immensely so we were excited that Brugge on North opened close to home.  They, like their sister restaurants, do not accept reservations so we were expecting a wait on Saturday night at 7p.m. as we had a group of six.  However, we were seated immediately and there never seemed to be a wait for tables while we were dining.  
The bar menu is extensive and we all had several different drinks from their cocktail list, each one remarkably delicious!  Between the six of us we had three orders of mussels,, a hamburger, and the duck entree.  All meals were fantastic! 
The only reason that I'm not yet giving this 5 stars is the service has room for improvement, but since this is a new restaurant, I'm sure that the kinks will be worked out.   Our server, while friendly enough, was slow in getting to our table when we sat down, and it seemed to take quite a while for the drinks to be made and delivered.  Also, we ordered 3 salads which were served with our meals instead of before as we requested as appetizers and one meal was served quite a bit after the rest of the food arrived.  At the end of dinner, although we were three couples, the check was combined and it seemed to be a slight annoyance to the waiter to split for us.  (our fault probably, as we should have asked upfront for separate checks)
We are looking forward to coming back and trying their brunch as Park Brugge is our favorite brunch in the city!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Wednesday night with my wife and her parents for dinner.  Since we had all been to Pointe Brugge and Park Brugge before, we wanted to give the new Brugge in our neck of the woods a taste.  So we headed over to the Northside to give Brugge on North a try.  At first we had a little difficulty in seeing it as it's located in the Alphabet City building but since there isn't much else around, we figured that's where it had to be located.  The inside of this place is interesting as it sort of shares a space with a bookstore and maybe has a stage?  There are curtain dividers to separate them but I don't think that either were down on the day we were there.  Brugge on North has both a dining room and a bar although both felt somewhat small and crowded.

For dinner on this evening I decided to start off my meal with the poutine before having a main entree of the chicken sandwich.  My wife helped to make this possible since I also wanted the moules which she ended up offering to order and share.  The menu describes the poutine As Brugge frites, bacon lardon, white wine chicken gravy, cheese curds and pickled peppers while it describes the chicken sandwich as chicken, jalape√±o pickle slaw, Gouda, terrain mayo on a baguette.  My poutine came out first and ended up being quite good.  What made it a little different from most of the poutines I have had previously was the fact that it was made from frites.  This meant that the fries were able to stand up to the wetness of the gravy without getting soggy which made for a more enjoyable poutine.  I also really enjoyed the pickled peppers which added that bit of acidity to an otherwise rich and savory dish.  My chicken sandwich was similarly good. The chicken itself was nice and crispy while the jalepeno slaw gave it a little heat and acidity and the terragon mayo gave it some extra flavor. It came with a cold orzo salad on this day which had some peppers and onion in it.  Last but certainly not least were my wife's moules and frites. She went with the classic white wine sauce as the base and boy was it good!  I especially enjoyed dipping the crusty bread in it and our table even ordered more bread to do just that.  Not to be outdone by the moules, her frites were good as well as they were super crispy on the outside.  The Maui dipping sauce was supposed to be terragon but had a vinegary quality to it which I loved and almost made it like eating chips and malt vinegar.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  As with all of the Bruges (North, Park, Pointe) it's with coming here just for their moules and frites.  However they also have some good other food and some interesting cocktails as well."}
{"text":"Just a solid place to spend time. Good food. Inventive and tasty cocktails. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time to Brugges at any of the locations. Such a great addition to the neighborhood. 
The service was great. The entire staff tag-teams your table and the food is every bit as good as rumored. I had the Brugges Burger, and my dining companion had the mussels in yellow curry. We shared a bowl of Poutine. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavor was exquisite. So glad it's a block and a half from my house!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and stopped by for a City of Asylum event on Thursday and decided to get dinner.  The hostess was very sweet and engaging (and even gave me suggestions for things to do on the North Side)  I was seated quickly despite it being a busy event.  My waitress was also delightful!  The food was yummy and the poetry event was a treat.  Good going, Brugge!"}
{"text":"3.5/5. I went on their fourth day of opening at 11am for brunch with three friends. They had a good cocktail list with a couple unique drinks. I ordered a special cocktail (the \"Mochi Fizz\"), but it took them 30 minutes to tell me that it was actually not available that day. One of my friends ordered the moules frites, which came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, the rest of us had to wait 50 minutes for our entrees to arrive. (To be honest, they were just not at all prepared that day. I will cut them some slack though since they had just opened.) I had the sausage hash for my entree, which came with two eggs and bread. The Hollandaise sauce was great, but the potatoes and sausage were just average. If I were to come back, I'd definitely get something else. Also ordered a side of frites, which came in their usual large plate. However, these were overcooked unfortunately. (I was disappointed since the frites are always perfect at Park Bruges and Point Brugge!)

{"text":"Was happy to check out this new restaurant in alphabet City, our favorite north side bookstore. Husband and I went for a mid-week lunch break. The menu is small enough not to overwhelm, but large enough to offer variety. The food was good, service was good. We will definitely be back again and hope to catch brunch some weekend as well when we don't have the kids. While it is not family unfriendly, it definitely atmosphere caters to a more quiet clientele!"}
{"text":"Not worth the trip....it was not super crowded and our 2 orders of mussels took almost an hour to arrive at our table.  We had called ahead to confirm that they had the same red curry mussels as Point Brugge , they said the did.  When we arrived and looked at the menu they did not!  There was a yellow curry sauce which was not nearly as good as the red curry at Point Brugge. Service was slow.  Mussels were average. Bread was blah.
The topper was when our check came they charged us a $25 corkage fee.... this fee is $15 at Point Brugge.  Maybe they think the rich come to the bowels of the North Side. Sorry this is an absurdly high corkage fee especially since there are very few items on the menu for $25 or more.....and when we questioned the server about it she sent the\"manager\" over to our table who arrived with a obvious total attitude, was rude and  said \"that's what we charge.\"  No \"I'm sorry you didn't know\" or give  a reason it was so high.  Will not be returning there any time soon and parking was a pain in the a** anyway!"}
{"text":"Brugge on North is not just an expansion of Park Brugge and Pointe Brugges in the East End. It is part of a new concept linked with the City of Asylum bookstore. The restaurant itself is situated on the site of the former Casuela that stood here. Entry is in the middle and you head off to your left if you want to dine here. The center section is a reading lounge and off to the right is the bookstore.

The staff was very warm and friendly. I got the opportunity to chat with the general manager JP Misselwitz who explained that everything they make is local sourced and is made fresh from scratch. Some of their product lines come from the Strip District.  Towards the back is the bar which is run by Tyler Wisniewski.

The menu was not overly extensive but you can get a good deal here if you even want a sandwich. You can also order off the separate bar menu. I ordered the chicken sandwich on baguette along with what appeared to be potato salad and their homemade slaw which I understand changes everyday.

As I was waiting for my food JP invited me to check out the bookstore and the center lounge area that accompanied it. Bookstore will be reviewed separately but basically he told me that it was designed for people of different ethnic groups that have fled from other countries and sought refuge here. I learned that Pittsburgh was one of three cities in the county to offer such a place.

In addition in the lounge area there is a stage where they can host live entertainment. Free WiFi is available and they have a private dining room downstairs which can also be used for events.

While I was browsing the books my waitress Sharon came over and told me my food was ready. It was indeed very good and asked if I wanted to sample some soup made by Maggie Conroy. She is the one who hand makes the slaw I was having so I agreed.  Soup is also one of her specialties. This soup was a chilled cheddar based cream soup and was it ever good! Believe me if I wasn't thinking about dessert I would have ordered a bowl. My sandwich was a nice size and laden with cheese. So good!! 

The desserts are made from scratch by lady whom they refer to as \"Dixie.\" I decided to try something and told them to surprise me. They brought out this delicious cheesecake with strawberries and lemon curd and strawberry glaze. I thought to myself that I could never finish this but it was so good I couldn't let it go to waste. 

Sharon was very attentive to my needs and answered any questions I had. After I was done I walked downstairs in the front to see the private dining area. It is beautifully appointed and can host about 30 people. 

The only difficulty is parking. Located on North Ave near the construction area of the old theater you can obtain if you are lucky an hour of free parking in the permit area on a side street. The walk isn't so bad on a sunny day.

I also learned from JP that they plan to host events for different ethnic minority groups with one being tomorrow. Their executive chef is Susie Conroy.

I love the concept idea of incorporating the City of Asylum bookstore, lounge, entertainment and restaurant into one. Also using farm to table ingredients made from scratch it is hard to go wrong here.In an area of the city that needs revitalization Brugge on North will bring that. It is located in the Mexican War St district and not too far away from the Children's Museum and Federal Galley. This place is a must return for me since I want to try their other offerings especially their made from scratch  soup."}
