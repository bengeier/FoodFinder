{"text":"I came here for lunch and tried the Stir Burger. I asked whether there was cheese and our server said there was so I asked him to hold the cheese. They should really indicate that it's a cheese burger on the menu. Lucky I asked. The burger is served with a grilled steak tip. The piece I got on my burger was like beef jerky. The \"steak tip\" was inedibly dry. I had to pull it off the burger.   The hand-cut fries that came with the burger were pretty good.   I would definitely go back and try some other menu items, but probably not the burger again since it was a bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"Boozehounds beware because you're about to go for broke when you venture into the doors of the brand new STIR Kitchen & Beverage Co in Mississauga. After years of focusing on beer with West 50 Pourhouse and wine with Ten Restaurant & Wine bar, the fellas at HIP Restaurants have upped their game once again and brought together the best of both worlds and added some cocktail excellence to put themselves over the top.  Before we get all saucy over their drink menu, let's chat about the actual space. STIR has completely redone the old Croc Bar/Crocodile Rock, and when I say redone, I mean obliterated all memories of the old places and in its stead released a glorious phoenix from those smoldering ashes. Ok, so I'm feeling a little poetic but realistically in the recent stream of of restaurants going overboard with the reclaimed wood, and exposed fixtures it's nice to see a spot maintaining a level of class while still inviting in a taste of the currently popular elements.   Back to the booze! Aside from an extensive craft and european beer line up, and a lengthy wine list, there are cocktails. Pages upon glorious pages of carefully crafted cocktails. All the classics make an appearance so I won't go through them all, it's up to you to visit and explore it for yourself, but just know - everything is there. One important thing that made me happier than a mouse in a cheese factory was that they offer, not one, but THREE different kinds of Old Fashioneds. BOOM! Take that Mississauga. I went with their classic OF and it was very very good.   The night of my visit was for their grand opening and unfortunately I had to leave before I could try any of the sample bites that were supposed to be going around, but instead I ordered and paid for a menu item to go along with their NY striploin steak steak (served with mash, seasonal veg and a delicious demi glaze). I'm usually not a strip steak fan, I find them tough and usually a poor quality, knowing that I asked for my steak to be on the slightly rare side of medium rare, but it didn't need it. The steak was tender, perfectly cooked and juicy. My mind might be changed when it comes to strip steaks now, and my wallet might be saved not having to buy more expensive cuts of meat.  A fantastic experience overall provided by old staff faves (a collection of the best from both West50 and Ten) and fresh excited newbies.  I'm going to reserve my 5th star for after I've had a chance to explore more of their cocktails, service and food on future visits. Until then...  Eatcrest Out!  Ps - With the patio foot print left by the last restaurant/bar, expect this to be one of Mississauga's Top 5 patios in 2016 (remember who said it first)"}
{"text":"My friends took me out for my birthday and we all chose Stir for their ambiance and great reviews.  Our group was a total of 18 gals.  Yes a big party. We only got one server and he had other tables.  Which meant slow service.  The food was out of this world.  We had the bread basket 5/5 Parmesan fries5/5 Spring rolls 4/5 For appetizers As a main we had the margarita pizza 4/5 The mushroom pizza was the best fish 5/5 And pasta with veggies 4/5 Overall food was great but service slow."}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5. I had heard good things about this place so I thought it was about time we went and checked it out. I made a reservation which was not needed because it was pretty empty. Really just a few after work people hanging out at the bar. The decor in here is beautiful, they really tore it down and rebuilt it to make it upscale from what it was before. Being a avid yelper foodie I came for the food but I am told that  Friday and Saturday nights are the time to come for the nightlife. Not gong to lie it felt weird having waitresses serving dinner in what looks like an upscale place in skimpy black outfits. I get it though, that's how they make the money at night at places like these. It's just an awkward transition when you're there for a meal at 6pm.  Now the food! I got the veggie burger and sweet potato fries. And my boyfriend got the crispy chicken bites. My veggie burger was truly fantastic! What a great patty, they put in just the right amount of ingredients (note - I hate when places overload with black beans, it makes it dry). They had really nice toppings as well and the bun, omg I don't know what kind of bread it was but the bun made the burger. It was almost buttery like. The fries were super crispy and the dipping sauce was great. My meal was definitely a 4.5. The chicken though from what I was told was really lacking, boring and not actual crispy like the name suggests. The drinks on the menu sound amazing but they are priced like downtown Toronto, which is a bit silly.  I think this would be a good place to have a girls night, or a small birthday gathering."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. I've passed this place so many times. I went here for a Christmas party. Had the Stir burger, it was great! Nice atmosphere, nice people. We also had the Salmon salad which was fine as well. Would go there again."}
{"text":"Horrible service, management has attitude problem, Christmas party for my staff people was unfortunately so bad I had promised my team that we would have another party a few weeks later which will cost me more money, all I can say is about another 100 people I've spoken to have said similar or worse things about this place"}
{"text":"All these amazing reviews convinced my bf and I to go to Stir. Unfortunately, we should have saved our money or maybe we should have just gotten subway that was right across from them in the same plaza. Food: 2/5 I ordered linguine carbonara which was extremely bland but loaded with ground black pepper. Sauce had nothing to do with a carbonara. Very thin sauce no flavor and oily not creamy . Bf ordered \"stir burger\" mushroom duxelle was over powering, choice of greens was questionable as it all wilted by the time it got to the table. Fries were tasty though. Also the grilled steak tip was unnecessary and he had to pull it off.  Because I didn't like my carbonara I asked for the schnitzel instead , however the schnitzel was more bland than the carbonara. It was unseasoned pork which was fry and again bland. Breading was poorly executed, maybe the oil wasn't hot enough when frying? Schnitzel is usually fried golden brown mine was pale. Potatoes were undercooked and crunchy. And for some reason they put like 2 cups of uncleaned tasteless and slightly burnt baby carrots on the plate? There was some sort of sauce on the schnitzel which really didn't have any purpose. Again , bland . a theme throughout the evening. Also I've seen photos of their dishes on here and they seem to be quite inconsistent with how the prepare and present their dishes. I got a slice of mushroom on my plate.  Dessert was a chocolate pots de creme. Lovely but not out of this world. More like chocolate pudding rather than a creamy decadent mousse.  I also find drinks were a tad expensive. Our appetizer was a cheese dip which was great. Can't really go wrong with cheese dip I suppose.  Waitress was wonderful and attentive. I give her a 5/5. Atmosphere is beautiful. But won't be going back. For $121 I can definitely get better else where."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised with my experience here. Not that I had bad expectations, but amazed at how good the food was!  My friends and I came here on Good Friday with reservations for 7pm.  The reservations were probably not necessary as the place wasn't too busy.  We were seated promptly and our server arrived in a timely manner.  Our server, Ben was great!  So fun to talk to and really out going.  I ordered the Diablo Chicken Supreme and my friends ordered the Garganelli Beef Bolognese, Seafood Fettuccine and the Brown Butter Ravioli. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  My chicken was thick and juicy and the veggies that came with my meal were just as delicious.  I tried my friend's bolognese and it is probably the best restaurant bolognese I've ever tried!  My friend liked my chicken meal too, that we ended up swapping meals half way through lol.  Not that we didn't enjoy our own, just we both liked the others more.  The friend that had the seafood fettuccine really liked his dish.  Plus they aren't pinch with the seafood, you get a good amount!  The venue is also so pretty.  The booths were cute and the decor was so beautifully put together.  My overall visit was great.  Next time I'll come closer to 10pm as there is a DJ that comes on, on Fridays and Saturdays.  Will definitely return for that bolognese lol."}
{"text":"We went there prior to the Grand opening. Thought the food was really good.  Really wanted to try the Chicken Supreme, but it's a bit spicy and I am oversensitive about Spicy food, so I had the Salmon which was good, but didn't think it was superior than other restaurants.   Although I must say that the Calamari was Amazing, definitely my first choice for Calamari right now.  Price was alright for what you get, but I think it was a bit higher than most comparable restaurants.  Staff was very prompt, friendly and courteous.  The ambiance is Beautiful, open, cozy and nice decor. Nice background music too.  Will definitely return and spread the word.  They are owned by the same chain that owns Ten Restaurant, so I think it should be good. Can't wait to see what the other Yelpers think."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow. Took 17 mins before someone took my drink order.  Had the Bourbon BBQ Chicken Pizza... There was nothing Bourbon or BBQ about this pizza. More tomato flavour than anything. Not quite impressed for the money I paid. My friends pizza wasn't even cooked through. Atmosphere was the only thing going for them that night."}
{"text":"I kinda missed the location on first pass because it was situated alongside pharmacy, medical laboratory and an employment agency. STIR KITCHEN is located along the main road although it is situated at the corner of the building. It is easier to spot the signage than look for the exact address after your GPS takes you to the area.  There is parking in the plaza although parking slots are divided into pocket areas. Come early if you hope to park nearest Stir Kitchen. Believe me, for women in \"killer stilettos\" the distance and walk between the parking lot to the venue matters.   I attended a trunk fashion show in the venue so the lay-out was arranged to accommodate the fashion show. Finding waiters took awhile because the models and guests seemed to blend well with the suited waiter in black and women servers in cocktail  black dress too.  The venue is divided into 2 areas. There is also a bar near the entrance. A small stage can accommodate small performances and bands. The food was fairly ok.   What was impressive tho was the DJ who played reggae music and occasionally takes to the floor for some soulful dancing. His music selection was soft, smooth and perfect for cooling down after a long day.  He is a must watch!"}
