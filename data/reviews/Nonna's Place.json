{"text":"I get the meatball sandwich from this place all the time, for the price it's an awesome value. Good solid sandwich with inexpensively priced extra toppings you don't usually see at a place like this (eg. rapini, grilled zucchini)."}
{"text":"Fantastic, go there as often as I can when eating out. Best veal sandwich I've ever had! Pasta sauce is to die for, and if you like really hot aged peppers in oil, grab a jar. She also makes really good rice balls in tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Yummers! The food, price and service is amazing!   WARNING! Portions are extremely generous and delicious! Yummers! The food, price and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"So delicious, such a generous portion, fresh bread and great pasta sauce for dipping!  You have to eat a sandwich here!!  $5 for a brekkie sandwich that is as big as your head. Ha!"}
{"text":"Noona's Place is as unpretentious as it comes and I like it that way. It serves fresh Italian pasta/meat dishes in a no nonsense way but always with a smile. While there are a few tables this place is basically a takeout lunch operation that caters to people who are really hungry.   I have not tried everything on the limited menu and frankly the meatball sandwich with a can of Brio is one of my faves  after which I need a nap. The fact that it always seems busy at lunch tells you what you need to know. Try it out for a hearty Italian sandwich and a bit of local history.....  From their website.....  \"Nonna's Place started as a dream for an ambitious Italian immigrant couple back in 1964. Rocco and Francesca Zuccaro wanted to create something that would support their young family and reflect their Italian culture. Originally known as Shaw Grocery, the Zuccaro family supplied the Bloor St /Symington area with their daily groceries. As time went on Francesca and Rocco continued by expanding into the soup and sandwich shop business. After 44 years of love, labour and passion, the Zuccaros retired, leaving Shaw Grocery in the hands of their eldest daughter. To keep the family legacy going, Shaw Grocery has been renamed Nonna's Place as a tribute to her parents hard work and dedication. Nonna's Place will continue to serve the community that the Zuccaro family will always cherish.\""}
{"text":"Great angelo/lamb. Very flavourful and a little spicy. The pasta was to die for. Would eat this every day of my life"}
{"text":"I understand this is a local joint and that the prices are extremely fair, but that is no excuse for the the poor quality of food I have experienced.  I have given Nonna's Place two chances. I did not think it was possible to mess up making a simple sandwich, but I couldn't stomach the grilled strip-loin sandwich nor the breakfast sandwich. And as much as I hate wasting food, they both ended up in the garbage with a few bites missing.  I am surprised at the good reviews. Maybe I ordered the only two duds on the menu. But two chances are all I'm willing to give this place. So long, Nonna."}
{"text":"The sandwich is amazing, its gigantic and the service is nice and friendly.  Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a countless number of times and it seems that whenever I did, it was always closed!! Some very strange store hours, only open 9-4 Mon-Fri. But today was the day, I finally happened to be close by on a weekday afternoon!   Really tiny in there, they have 3 tables, a little stool area, some retail merchandise (hard pasta bags, sauce jars, etc.), and the cash is at the back. They also had a TV on so customers staying in to eat would have something to watch.  Service was amazing! The lady was extremely helpful, cracked some jokes, and just made me feel comfortable. When I looked at the menu, I couldn't believe the price, only $6.75 for a full sized chicken parm sandwich!  Thats ammmmaazziinnggg!!! At any other mainstream sandwich place like California Sandwiches or San Francesco's, its about 8 bucks for the sandwich with Noo toppings, so this is definitely a great price! Cheese was a dollar extra (well worth it since they put sooo much) and I also got mushrooms and onions, which were free of charge.  Took maybe 5-10 minutes to make, since its fresh, and then I enjoyed my beautiful sandwich by the window. The sauce tasted like it came straight out if the garden, nice and fresh, and clearly not mass produced hehe. I personally would like a bit more spices and seasonings in the sauce, but still, it's not like I didn't enjoy it. Bun was fresh, huge, and I swear there was at least a breast and a half of chicken in there....very filling to say the least!  If you happen to be in this area during their open hours, it's definitely worth a visit. I just wish they had longer store hours!"}
{"text":"Italian take out joint selling delicious sandwiches. My favourite: Eggplant Parmesan. Simply made with mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushroom and onions. As other reviewers have stated, the portions are large and yummy. Only downside - no washrooms. But, good if you are on the go."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've only ever had the veal sandwich and chicken sandwich here.  It's been 5 years since I started coming here and I have such a hard time deciding between my two fave sandwiches that I haven't ventured any further yet.  The bun is fresh, the chicken/veal is lightly breaded and the sauce is... Nonna worthy. Seating is limited, but they do tons od takeout business and are usually sold out before closing time, so don't come late. The staff are also so friendly"}
{"text":"Nice family vibe restaurant. Closed by 4, short hours. Very good chicken sandwich. Large portion. Didn't feel great afterwards, big bun, breading."}
{"text":"I like this place. Got takeout from here a couple times already and the portions are really big. Highly recommend the meatball sandwich. Price is reasonable and is the same quality as the st Lawrence market ones. U can split a sandwich between two people if u are both not too hungry!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place for lunch on a weekday when I was working from home. The hours are impossibly inflexible for the average 9-5 monkey. Their hours are something like 9-4:30 mon-fri!  Anyway, I got the veal sandwich. It's a big sandwich. comes on a large kaiser bun with a generous helping of schnitzel-style veal cutlets bathed in a tomato marinera sauce. The sauce is very good and tangy - a nice counterpoint to the heaviness of the veal.  Overall a pretty good sandwich, though it doesn't travel too well (due to the large amount of marinera) so eat it fast. Not mind-blowing, but good enough to eat again. I think next time i'll try the eggplant sandwich."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a try after passing this place for years. This is honestly the best review lol I ordered the chicken and veal sandwich at lunch.   Pros:  1. The size, the sandwich is huge.  2. The bun was fresh and huge.  3. The lady server seamed nice and was helpful.  4. The portion of the veal and chicken was big, they don't cheap out on the meat. 5. The sandwiches are not soggy. 6. They cut the sandwiches in half.   Cons: 1. The place has a horrible exhaust fan and you can see the stove. Since the place is so small it honestly stunk and the windows were all foggy. I waited for 15-20min for my sandwiches and my coat STUNK when I left. I literally STUCK like food and so did my car afterwards  :( Girls with thick hair beware lol  2. The Chicken and Veal are breaded with 0 seasoning. I read a few people saying their sandwiches were bland, but holy smoke they were right. It seemed like there was no salt, or anything. The sandwich literally tasted like:  - breaded chicken - 0 seasoning - Plain tomato sauce  -Bread   Literally thats it lol The taste of anything was seriously lacking which disappointed me. BUT if you are one of those people that like their hotdogs or burgers plain you will love this place.   3. There is a line up, which would be okay if it didn't cause me to stink and all that for a bland sandwich.   4. The only free toppings on your sandwich is, onions and mushrooms. Anything else, including Tomatoes is $0.50 -$1 . Its an extra $1 for cheese and who the hell charges for Tomatoes lol  Overall I would not go back, and honestly I wouldn't even tried this place if I knew how much taste was actually lacking. BUT if you want food that tastes like your mom or grandma made you at home, this is a place you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"The best place in the 'hood. EAT THE EGGPLANT SANDWICH. It's got weird hours: M-F lunch only. Make the trip, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way home and we ordered the veal sandwich and an arancini ball. The sandwich was large and delicious, but the arancini ball was dry and lacking in cheese and filling. The wait time was short (under 8 minutes) and the service was friendly and efficient. For under $7 for a filling and tasty sandwich - you can't go wrong here.   Negative: their hours! They are closed weekends and Mondays, and they close before 5pm. In other words, only open for breakfast and lunch on weekdays except for Mondays."}
{"text":"Veal sammy with cheese ($1), mushrooms and onions.  No washrooms, be warned."}
{"text":"Many times i've been tempted to come here...who can withstand Nonna's cooking??  I finally ventured there today and inside is a no frills mostly take out kind of place with a few tables.  Menu is on the wall and consists of about 6 sandwiches ($5.50 or so, rice balls, S ($3.50) and L pasta ($5) along with coffee's and a few other items.   I ordered the meatball sandwich, it was monstrous - the size of my head, meatballs spilling everywhere, but it was delicious!  Home made extra lean ground beef meatballs on your choice of white or whole wheat bun.  Free toppings include mushrooms, sauteed onions or hot peppers (who does this anymore??) along with a few paid ones (cheese, rapini).  Be prepared for food coma afterwards.  Everything there is home made and fresh, the portions are big, the prices good, friendly service, tons of regulars coming in and out. Nonna - ti amo!"}
