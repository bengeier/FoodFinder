{"text":"I ordered for delivery and the food arrived in about an hr and was hot and fresh. It was all very tasty, I didn't enjoy the fried rice as there were a lot of bean sprouts but that's just personal preference. Overall good food for a decent price."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I write this review as a warning to all. My family ordered the combo for 3 which included beef and chicken. We did delivery. After we opened it they gave us two containers of celery with 3 pieces of tiny meat in it each. I called them to see if they would give me what i ordered. They said essentially too bad all of our meat dishes are 80% vegetable. She went on to tell me that i was the one who said i didnt want any onions. As if giving me 2 bowls of celery AND ONIONS would of made up for the fact that there was no chicken in my cashew chicken or beef in my szechuan beef. What a joke. She said every single chef can verify that they counted my pieces of meat. Riiiiiiiight. What a joke. I was totally pissed. 40 bucks and every one in my family went to bed hungry."}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh and smelled sour when it was delivered. You can clearly tell it was reheated - NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for a group of 5 and asked to have it delivered. I was told it would be 1 hour and it arrived in 20 minutes, 1st indication of a problem.  The chicken balls and chicken soo gai were rock hard, as if they had been cooked early in the day and sat in an oven all day. The gravy for the chicken soo gai gravy was white and flavorless.  The hakka noodles were a poor imitation. The only good thing was the beef with broccoli. I will never order from here again, we threw most of it out."}
{"text":"Typical American style Chinese food. If you are looking for a quick, cheap lunch or take-out, this place is a good bet. I definitely prefer the Ajax location to the Scarborough location. My kids love the special golden fingers. Similar to chicken balls but longer and crispier. The egg rolls are excellent in flavour- although a bit greasy- but what type of Chinese food isn't? Calling ahead is always preferred for takeout. If you would prefer no MSG remember to specify when ordering."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is the best option for Chinese food in Ajax.  Not as typical for \"Canadian style\" Chinese food. Service is definitely typical though. Had my 2 young children under the age of 3, diaper bags, booster seats, etc, early lunch hour on a weekday,  The host/ owner? was very rude about the space I took up with our belongings, although there was absolutely NO ONE else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"A great spot. Everything on the menu is exactly what you want. The pork wonton soup is great. Had a few different things from here now and nothing has been disappointing. Great takeout spot. Always ready on time."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food today and decided to give House of Wong a try. I haven't eaten Chinese food in a long time so I made sure I ordered the simplest thing on the menu, a veggie chow mein and 4 veggie spring rolls. This food was absolutely disappointing.   The spring rolls were icy! Literally ICY! I guess they were only partially cooked...Maybe that's a new thing now, barely cooked spring rolls? The chow mein itself was also quite gross. It was soggy and bland.   I can't believe I paid 17 dollars for insipid chow mien and half cooked spring rolls. Way to ruin a craving. I would've been better off just eating a bowl of cereal."}
{"text":"Ordered online from just eat. It was fairly late at night on a Friday but the food came fairly quickly (about just under half an hour).  Service seemed good, they were very friendly when the driver dropped of the food.   The food was okay, I ordered the Szechuan tofu and mushroom fried rice. The tofu could've had a little more flavour in the sauce, and the fried rice could've and more mushrooms. Overall not terrible food, not amazing.   If it's late and night and there aren't too many options around I would order again."}
{"text":"I ordered a few items off the menu for delivery through Just Eat and was told that the maximum waiting time would be 45 minutes. After nearly an hour of waiting, I called the restaurant to ask if our food was on the way and they said \"yes.\" They honestly must have started cooking our food after we called, because the delivery man didn't show up at our door for another 40 minutes.   As for the food itself, it was incredibly bland and perhaps the worst Chinese food I've ever had.   I would not recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out since I had a wicked craving for some jar doo wings.  Figured that maybe this place is pretty good since it's been around for so long.  How do I know they've been around forever?  Well, the phone number on their sign doesn't have the area code.  Then I walked in and that was another confirmation.  Felt like I walked in there through a time machine, but not necessarily in a bad way. Anywho, I just ordered for take-out and ordered some jar doo wings and one of their specials (E) which which was an OCD's nightmare as the sauces were all on top of the dishes.  Yes, I'm one of those \"weirdos\" that don't like their food getting all mixed up.    Jar Doo Wings - Was a little disappointed as I've gotten so used to jar too wings that have been marinated in more soya sauce.  The wings looked like regular wings that was quite bland.  The only burst of flavour was from the drizzled lemon from the lemon wedge.  Maybe I was given the wrong order?  Who knows.  Either way, it still could've been much better.  3/5.  Chicken Fried Rice - Was your typical chicken fried rice.  What I liked about it was that the chunks of chicken was pretty generous.  Flavour was alright so I'd probably order it again. 4/5.  Chicken Balls - I know chicken balls aren't exactly a \"staple\" Chinese dish but I love this shit.  And to be quite honest, these were one of the best ones I've had simply because the ratio of chicken to batter was great.  For once, I had more chicken than dough.  Only con is that the chicken was a little on the dry side.  Now, if they had actually served the sweet and sour sauce on the side, then that would've been much better.  Also the sauce lacked a lot of flavour.  4/5.  Sweet & Sour Sparerib - The sauce was nice but other than that, it was also quite bland.  Was a little too overcooked to my liking so it was a little tough to chew on.  2.5/5."}
{"text":"House of Wong used to be really delicious, now not so much. The wait times have also decreased in productivity. Ordered two Chicken Phad Thai for delivery. Was told 40 minutes maximum. Waited an hour and 15 minutes for my order, and I live in the area. The Phad Thai was really bland, there were no bean sprouts in it eaither. All it was, was noodles that tasted like it was cooked in too much oil. The egg rolls and house plum sauce is really tasty however. I won't  be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty. The staff was super friendly. Had the chicken balls, chicken fried rice, egg rolls and noodles. All delicious!!! The interior is dated and they were slow to bring the food. Despite that, it was a good experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on numerous occasions and I have always gotten decent, tasty food. Portions are always excellent and food it always hot when we got it home.   No complaints."}
{"text":"My take out order included chicken chop suey, chicken balls and egg rolls. The egg rolls were VERY undercooked! The chicken chop suey had 4 pieces of chicken and a clear gelatinous substance could be seen in spots. The batter on the chicken balls was cracked, sometimes did not cover the entire piece of chicken and I sadly got a mouthful of whatever oil they were fried in. I lay here now on my couch with my guts twisting in knots and a case of diarrhea as well other physical ailments. I am never ordering from this NASTY place again! Food poisoning is not fun!   The restaurants reply when I called in with my complaint about the food was to argue and call me a liar! I was shocked as I was willing to bring back the food (this was before I felt sick) for them to see and all I wanted was a refund for the food that was not properly cooked."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend there since we were on the toronto zoo and were looking for a chinese place to eat. I ordered chicken with broccoli, vegetable fried rice and my girlfriend got chicken fried rice, chicken chow mein and egg roll. The vegetable rice was decent. Was the thing I ate the most because the chicken with broccoli was tasteless. Usually, this what I use to decide if ill ever to back somewhere. My girlfriend's food was mostly decent based on what she said but the egg roll was disgusting and smell weird. The place is on a ok location and looks clean. If you are in a hurry for a chinese place and you are near it, go ahead but remember to tell them exactly how you want the food. In my case I would have said add more soy sauce and some extra flavor."}
{"text":"It was my first and last time trying this place. Food was not at all as expected.   The person ordering take-out in front of us was complaining that the last time he ordered the crispy noodle chow mein they weren't crispy at all. I just thought this person isn't aware that most of the noodles get soggy on the way home. But no we got the same thing. I emphasized \"crispy\" noodles beef chow mein. The noodles came completely boiled and there was no sauce either. Looked like water in the container instead of sauce. Strange. Perhaps they misheard me and thought I ordered something else. But I'm not gonna chance it again. I also ordered chicken teriyaki and the chicken tasted bad. Not an enjoyable meal at all, I was just forcing myself to eat it so fill my hunger."}
{"text":"A decent place for Chinese food in the east end of Scarborough.  It can be a bit pricey. The deep fried bbq chicken with rice is a new addition to the menu.  I like the spring rolls over the egg rolls as I have found the sometime the egg rolls are not evenly cooked.    General Tao chicken will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Everything I seem to order has a centimetre of water in the bottom of it. (except the rice) Nothing is very crispy it's all sort of wet.  I've given it a shot a few times and it's the same each time.  I've never ordered Chinese before where it was so well... moist and soft.  I of course haven't tried the full menu just some of the standards but I'm not a fan.  I live close by so I keep giving it a shot because its close."}
{"text":"Good Canadian Chinese Food that's been established for a very long time. My Sister likes the food here as its not spicy ... Unless your like me who loves spicy so I request it.  Homemade Egg Rolls .. Plum and Hot Mustard Sauce ... AMAZING !!  Ok I'm drooling right now ;)"}
{"text":"No issues with food quality or presentation. Love their hot & sour soup.  Chow mien combo with beef , vegetables & soft noodles was quite good & filling. Mango salad side was flavourful but perhaps over spiced with too many onions."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering House of Wong for years, since the Silver Dragon down the street closed in 1999.  We always order the chicken balls, pork fried rice, shang-hi noodles (extra spicy and even then they are not too bad), beef & broccoli, deep fried won tons, sometimes honey garlic ribs. We recently started ordering the Honey Chili Chicken which is also good, as well as General Tao chicken. Spring rolls are also good and pretty authentic although that's just what I've been told if I'm being honest, as I don't know what 'authentic' really means.  We have always found the food very fresh, the chicken always crispy and the food generally excellent. The only problem we have ever had is they have a tendency to forget items when delivering! It's usually the won tons unfortunately, which everyone loves for scooping up rice with.  We never eat there, always take away or delivery. The decor is typical old fashioned Chinese restaurant decor, faded carpet, peeling paper, not the greatest but not the worst.  Always double check your order on the phone by reading your order back or having them read it back to you. Delivery times tend to be long esp on weekends. There is %10 off if you pick up and pay in cash I believe. On holidays like New Years, Christmas Eve, Mothers Day etc call at least 2 hours ahead even if you are picking up.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I won't even spend too much time writing a review on this place, food taste like they put all the right ingredients into a bowl with the meat and microwaved it.   I ordered   Thai green curry (it wasn't green) Beef and black bean sauce( no black bean) Deep fried crispy chicken wings  (The wings were very good)  I called back to complain and they didn't answer the phone. 9 pm"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese delivery I have ever had! Chicken balls were fresh and had a decent amount of chicken inside. Chicken fried rice was fluffy and actually had flavour. General Tso chicken had just enough kick and the veggies were crisp. The ginger beef was very gingery but the ratio was 80% veg  and 20%.   They gave us an order of chicken wings FREE and my expectations were low but seriously, they were delish!"}
{"text":"I come to this place when feeling nostalgic for 70's Chinese Restaurant decor and the typically popular North American version of Chinese food. The staff are great, friendly and professional, always refilling your water glass on a hot day and making sure we ve seen all of the available options. The reliable weekday lunch combos for $6 or dinner meal combos are fine. I have yet to taste anything spectacular from this place, but you know what you ll be getting, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg and they ve got discount for pick up (and lots of seats and magazines to leaf through while you wait). There s a lot of newer restaurants in the area that may be taking away business from this restaurant (it s been here for a long time). Give em a chance!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've had in a longgggg time.  Since I live in Scarborough, there is no shortage of decent Chinese places to choose from and last night, after a botched curry attempt, I decided to order Chinese take out and try out a new place.  We normally order from SS Kitchen which is always good but I thought it may be a good idea to try somewhere new and have a back up delivery joint.  And boy, was that a mistake.    I ordered YangChow Fried Rice, Shrimp with lobster sauce, Chicken Soo Gai and Singapore noodles.  The delivery order came to a little over $42 (which is on the pricey side given the quality and portion sizes).  All the ingredients (shrimp, bbq pork, etc) in fried rice were bland and the rice, not quite \"fried\" enough, leaving chewy lumps of rice packed into a tiny takeout container.  Shrimp with lobster sauce was a mixture of unbalanced black bean sauce wasn't and egg and the sauce tasted bitter in some bites.  Singapore noodles certainly looked the part but had seasoning issues again and last but not least, their chicken Soo Gai clearly reflected the restaurant's attempt to stretch one chicken breast to appear as many pieces, as the chicken pieces were sliced, pounded and dunked in huge amount of batter before being fried in what tasted like old oil.  Funny enough, the thinly sliced and pounded chicken breast pieces were so tough to chew and barely edible in a coating of old-oil-soaked batter, the horrifying reality of the Soo Gai sauce (they call it a mushroom gravy.  Is that even Chinese???) was almost an after thought.    It's amazing how some places can stay in business this way.  I certainly wouldn't be picking up the phone to call them again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this restaurant or food. They have a very spacious dining area, every time I've been here it has never been completely packed. The staff is friendly, they don't speak that much though. It's a nice quiet place to eat. The food is inexpensive, although I find ordering take-out the food takes long, vs dining-in. Though I've recently fallen in love with another Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for many years. Whenever we need Chinese and we are at home, we get house of wong. I also finished some exams, and they fed me through it! Lol   Usually I get the veggie fried rice and general tso. Also I have enjoyed the fried wontons, Singapore noodles. My fam also gets the spare ribs, but not my thing.   Fortune cookies aren't always correct though, so beware."}
