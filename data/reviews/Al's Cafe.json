{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Al's Cafe for the first time on Valentine's Day.  He had a table by the beautiful fire place.  The service was excellent and the food was even better.  We had the sweet and spicy buffalo wings for an appetizer.  They were cooked to perfection - just the right amount of crispiness.  And, the sauce is no doubt the best I have every had.  For my entree, I had the Pasta with Crabmeat Fra Diavolo. This was a very large portion of low calorie deliciousness.  After the appetizer, I could only eat a small portion of it.  But, I can enjoy more of it for lunch.  My boyfriend ordered the Ambrogi Hoagie, which is their grilled cheese steak.  This sandwich was also the best I have ever had.  Yes, I made him give me a bite...  It came on half of a very large bun with piles of steak, peppers, onions, and of course cheese, and served with french fries.  Just superb!  Our server's name was Rose.  She was very attentive, but not too much.  She kept our drinks filled and made sure we had everything we needed during our visit.  I just can't say enough good things about it.  You will just have to try it out for yourself!  :)"}
{"text":"First time there. Had zucchini strips and they were terrible. Tiny little pieces of zucchini  heavlily breaded . Roast beef sandwich was over cooked and dry. The only good thing was  the ice cold beer. In our party of six only one was satisfied. Definitely would not recommend B Stover"}
{"text":"Have been going there for years but food quality has slipped as of late.  Recently went there with my wife and ordered the salmon special.  The salmon was so over cooked it was inedible.  The waitress only showed up once to ask how the food was but was gone in the blink of an eye.  When she did finally stop by and we told her about the food she really didn't seem to care.  Won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive. If you can't find something you like, you're not trying. The chicken parm was delicious and plentiful. I couldn't eat the second chicken breast. And the white chocolate cake was incredible. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss. You can go elsewhere for the same quality and pay less ie outback, bonefish, Olive Garden. The restaurant itself needs redecorated- especially the party rooms. I have also done three parties here in the past. One I was very disappointed because the beef was dry and overcooked. The last two I stuck to Italian and it was good but that's harder to screw up with a large group of people. The menu is too ambitious and must be pared down- that's what's holding this place back. Als needs to pick a cuisine and stick to it."}
{"text":"Finally after four years living in the South Hills, we tried Al's Café on a Friday evening.  My wife, who is gluten free, ordered the perch dinner special.  It came breaded although not so indicated on the menu.  Ok, she should have asked.  The manager said it wasn't supposed to be breaded but the perch wasn't holding together, so the kitchen staff breaded it.  ??  They replaced it with perch broiled.  It tasted so bad my wife couldn't eat it.  The staff was apologetic and we weren't charged for her meal.  I had the standard fried fish dinner (slaw and fries) which was also featured that evening.  I didn't care for the breading but it was ok.  Just a bad experience.  I doubt we will give it another try."}
{"text":"I live right down the street fom Al's, very convenient... The Bar food is excellent and the atmosphere is perfect......They were NONE smoking for a couple of month, WE loved it....Was in there the other day and they went back to smoking,  it STUNK BADLY of cigarette smoke and my clothes stunk, when I got home.....We will never go back again, until it goes back to NONE SMOKING....That's ok..plenty of bars around.....Colin & Pam But like I said GREAT BAR AND GREAT FOOD.. And the bartenders are great people. Just like I said the smoke is very bad and while you're eating your food people light up cigarettes right next to you it sucks"}
{"text":"I still don't know why people like this place. The food is over priced and they do not have a very good menu and it tastes fair.  I was disappointed cause I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment 3 days consecutively and in Sunday, the first day, I ordered a taco salad that came with taco seasoned shredded chicken, clack olives, cheddar cheese, rats and ranch dressing-it was phenomenal. So I went back on Valentine's Day with my mom and sister and order another phenomenal meal of pecan salmon. But today when I went I reordered the taco salad and they gave me a bed of lettuce with onion, cucumber, black olives, tomatoes and no salsa or sour cream and told me that was the way they served their taco salads and I told them that's not what I received on Sunday and I quickly pointed the description out in their regarding both salads and the manager had the audacity to ask if it was at Al's that I got the taco salad like I did it known where I ate. I hope this was just a fluke and they get rid of the insulting manager. And they learn to make what their menu describes."}
{"text":"Great food, however I think the price is a little high. So, I would recommend Al's, but you could get a better quality meal at Atria's for the same price as Al's."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! We are in the bar area and our bartender was very nice and she was always there to get us refills and make sure we were okay. I would recommend Al\"s to my friends and I have because every time I've gone I've left happy!!"}
{"text":"I was there for my buddies rehearsal dinner so we were in an upstairs banquet type room. The food was really good the service was also very good I would recommend having an event like that there again or something of that nature overall Top Notch service, and a great experience"}
{"text":"This place actually makes a good hamburger.  I also noticed they no longer allow smoking at the bar.  I occasionally stop here for a sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The manager is very attentive and the staff knowledgeAble about the extensive menu. Very family friendly. Food is above average bar food. Good drink selection...although could use more craft beers."}
{"text":"Al's by far is one of the most eclectic place I have ever been to.  I have been to Al's many times and still I cannot pin down the dress code.  I have seen people there in dresses, suits, athletic shorts, and hoodies.  I gather from that...anything goes! The menu at Al's is insane.  You name it, in some fashion it is on that menu.  I have never eaten dessert there because I am always so incredibly full after my entree.  I can honestly say I have liked everything that I have tried.  Never a disappointment.  The bar area on a weekend is not the scene for young \"20 somethings\" to hang out.  That is geared for the 40+ crowd.  The atmosphere is set with all of the animals hanging on the walls around you. The wait staff is typically pretty good. I have never had any complaints about their service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times this past year and have never been dissapointed . The place is huge . I have never had to wait . The bar area is very comfortble with plenty of tvs. The service is excellent . The menu is large withamu varieties . The food has always been good . Located in a very safe neighborhood with ample free parking . Great for families , a date or just to grab a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"The food is good. Very salty but tasty. French onion soup, French dip, and French fries are all on the close-to-being-too-salty side, but enough water fixes that :) Unfortunately, the prices are too high for the amount of food you actually get. The food and atmosphere is similar to Friday's but more expensive."}
{"text":"Actually I'm giving a 3.5. This establishment doesn't knock my socks off but gets the job done.   The food is good but just missing a tad of flavor to take to a possible 4 star. The service was perfect but unfortunately I forgot to grab our waitresses name.   It's a nice place and the prices are reasonable. I'd recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Recently dined there for Thanksgiving. Absolutely wonderful! Delicious food and reasonably priced, too. It was 3 courses for around $29.00 a person, and for kids maybe a bit less.  First course was soup/salad, then you could choose ham or turkey for the main entree. This included mashed pots w/gravy, sweet potatoes, green beans, along with a generous portion of your chosen meat. The turkey was tender, moist , and flavorful. The third course was dessert; a choice of dutch apple or pumpkin pie. Seriously, if you are looking for for an option for T-giving and don't want to cook/clean for hours, consider Al's Cafe. It is a much better option than either Ditka's or Buca di Beppo. Both of these were maybe 2 out of 5 stars and more expensive than Al's Cafe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for seafood. My husband got the large fish sandwich. It came with fries and a portion of col slaw. I looked on the lent special menu, and got the shrimp ravioli. It came with either a salad, or soup and fresh warm bread and butter. I had a small garden salad with ranch which was really delicious and fresh. The shrimp ravioli was so good, the alfredo sauce was homemade as I asked the waitress. The shrimp were a little small but I didn't mind because otherwise it would of been too much shrimp flavor with the alfredo. The portion size was decent and was enough to make me feel full and plenty. I used the warm bread to dip in the shrimp ravioli and that was key to a perfect meal. I really enjoyed our time. The shrimp alfredo was $15.00 and wasn't bad for the portion and delicious taste. Definitely will be back soon to try a fish sandwich like my husband tried just to try something else too. The sandwich was two big pieces of fried fish and looked like enough food to feed two grown men. He has some to take home as well. I ate my entire meal at the restaurant! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is our family's \"go to\" restaurant.   It has a very large menu so everyone can find something they like.  My favorite is their Reuben!   It is by far the best Reuben I've ever had.  I've stopped ordering them anywhere else because they don't live up to Al's.  Another family favorite is there pizza!  My boys love the chicken bacon ranch.   Lots of toppings and lots of flavor!    The only thing I've ever been disappointed with was the chicken and shrimp salad...it was tasty but only came with two shrimp.        The staff is very friendly and even when they are busy you don't have to wait very long for your food!         Give Al's a try, I'm sure your family will find some favorites too!  :)"}
{"text":"I go here all the time with my family. Great food, great service, great at taking and keeping reservations!! Love the extensive menu and specials are always delicious too!"}
{"text":"We had a few drinks at the bar. The drinks are pricey for a lower class establishment. The bar smelled like smoke. It's not a bad place it served its purpose."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the service we received last evening from the bar staff, well actually the one female bartender on Wednesday evening. She never greeted us, or brought our drinks over to the table, had to get her attention twice to order another drink after standing up at the bar for five minutes and asking for another drink while her back was toward us until she decide to mosey on over and act disgusted we were there. It wasn't a busy time. She was very unpleasant, and quite frankly will NOT return to a place that doesn't appreciate business.  There are other places to chose from, it won't be Al's Cafe again. Could have gone anywhere else and received better service- makes me mad it ruined our evening."}
{"text":"I wouldnt go out of the way to go to Al's but given that the area doesn't have a ton of options its not bad.  Standard American food in the dining area with reasonable prices.  The food is edible but nothing to write home about and the prices are reasonable.    The decor is confused as to whether it wants to but a family restaurant, corner bar, or hunting lodge.    Service is solid.   The bar area is walled off from the restaurant which enables them to let people smoke, which is strange.    Overall, it's not a fine place to grab a sandwich, but I wouldn't make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time.  Came on short notice...and wow...I've been missing out!   It Was the waitress's first table and this is her first Waitress job.  You couldn't tell...because she was phenomenal!  Great memory and great personality!  Got the shrimp and scallop linguini, and my son got the club sandwich.  Everything was perfectly cooked and flavored!!!   Will come again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Menu is huge. Food is average. Price is fair. Nice place to visit to hang out with friends for the evening. Always able to be seated upon arrival."}
{"text":"I use to go only on occasion. For a bar/café do they have a pretty large menu. But the prices are ridiculously over priced. You'd expect this in the city or in Peters Township but not Bethel Park. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. Just not worth the high price is all.  But Monday night I left the house after the WWE Raw. I wanted to watch the 2nd half of the Pens game and get something to eat. I started off close to home and hit 4 other places before getting to Al's. Everybody else closed their kitchen at 11:00. so I moved on. Despite Al's kitchen not yet being closed I ended up not eating there at all. I was even willing to put up with the high price just to watch the game and eat.  The bartender was across the bar chatting with some customers. I sat down next to some co-workers. I asked them if they know when the kitchen was open till. The guy on the other side of me said Midnight. My coworkers said, \"Yes, you have 10 more minutes.\" I watched the Bartender leave the people he was talking to and go to the register then back to them 3 times. Each time chatting for a bit. They were paying but it shouldn't have taken that long, especially since a new person had walked in. I finally yelled across the bar \"DUDE\". He came over with an attitude towards me now and very rudely asked me \"What is it?\" I told him I wanted to order food before his kitchen closed. He said it closed 10 minutes ago. I said, these people all just told me the kitchen closes at midnight. He waved over to the clock and started making some rude comment about that already having passed when I knew full well it hadn't. I just grabbed my coat and left before I said something I would regret as one thing that pisses me off the most is someone is lying to me. Of course when I got to my car and started it up the clock in side still said 6 minutes to 12.  I asked my coworker today what that jerks name was because I wanted to report him to his manager. He said he is the manager. I said, well the owner then. He said that's him. Well since there is no way I can get any resolution since the owner is a complete and utter jag off I simply will never go back again."}
{"text":"Now I know why I haven't been here since I was a kid.  Advice-dont have a 10 page menu and focus your culinary efforts on something.  Overall this is probably close to one of the worst meals we have ever had.   Server zero knowledge of dining and bar. Asked if they had any craft beers on tap. She told me no, then I walked over to the bar and there is at least dogfish 60, Sam seasonal, and summer shandy.    I unfortunately did not get a beer or two, sorry Al's for not getting that extra $12 out of me.   Appetizers- got calamari, (which fiancé wanted), rubbery.  Stuffed port mushrooms- underwhelming, fake crabmeat  Entrees- mother got prime rib dinner, was about a 5oz cut, overcooked and looked like a chuck dell.   Fiancé got Reuben, it wasn't bad, the frozen fries were probably the best part of the meal. Reuben passable.   Finally I got the chicken a la Pittsburgh, which was an interesting combo of Marsala and crabmeat. I should of know then, to stay clear. Mashed Redskins were hard, and the crabmeat that came with the dish was of course fake and would fit into a teaspoon.   Will never go back."}
{"text":"Was here for a funeral. Had a limited menus. The French Onion soup was awesome. Had glazed salmon and it was average at best. Fish was tough and tasted a tad fishy. Waitress was busting her hump the whole time. Decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Al's has stood the test of time for good reason.  It has good food, timely service and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  You just feel at home at this place.  Try the fish sandwich!  Also, they have BIG beers on tab, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing visit, first and last. The kids ordered the usual grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich, by her account, ok but not great. I had the chicken wrap. The chicken tasted like it was cooked on the Forman grill. Very bland. Add tomatoes and lettuce. Still bland. Fries were crisp but tasteless. Service started well but then our server, who was nice, disappeared.  Too many choices around to go back.  Thanks for trying."}
{"text":"Seems a bit overpriced for the amount and quality of food you get.  My husband & I split an entree, and we were charged an extra $8!!  We were never made aware of the charge ahead of time, so I was very upset.  They refused to remove the charge.    Been there several times to try different things, but the only thing that is consistent are that the portions are small for the amount that you pay."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this place. Love that the kitchen is open late and the beer is always cold, but most importantly, Al's never fails to be our go to, don't want to eat healthy, pack on the calories restaurant. It is close to home and the hearty, filling food late at night is sometimes exactly what is necessary after a long, tough week. It is big enough that we're not normally ever seated by another party and the service has always been prompt. The mac and cheese is extra cheesy and the desserts are almost too decadent to handle. The only thing is that I find it to be overpriced."}
{"text":"Grew up with the place right around the corner and have still frequented it now that I'm older!  Never a bad meal there.  Always a good time!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Al's for dinner after hitting some golf balls.  I was seated immediately.  I had the French onion soup for starters.  It was delicious!  For an entree I chose the Jack Daniels grilled chicken, strawberry and walnut salad.  It was also very good. The menu is huge.  There were so many options that looked so good.   I would definitely recommend Al's!"}
{"text":"New to the area & tried it three times. This place probably used to be decent. Aside from the old & dreary interior, it still boasts a cigarette machine in the bar & a condom machine in the bathroom. The food isn't good bar food. Bland & mediocre. Today was treated to all TVs turned to Fox News & political commentary from some guy drinking vodka at noon. Strange & hostile environment. Never again."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I met halfway between our houses at Al's Cafe recently. While I've been there numerous times in the past, this is my first time reviewing. Please note that this review is based on both the most current AND all prior experiences.  The sandwiches we ordered at the bar were outstanding. He had the Ambrogie's hero and I had the cheese steak. The fries were cooked to perfection and the serving size was more than sufficient - not too much, not too little.   My compatriot also had the wedding soup, which he said was quite good.   The only \"drawback\" to Al's Cafe is the menu. I call it \"paralysis by analysis\", to borrower a phrase from my chess studies. It's simply too big. I know, I know... you never get tired of hearing that, amirite guys? Kidding aside, the menu is massive. That doesn't even factor in the daily specials(!).   I find it best to peruse the menu online before heading out to the restaurant. At least that way, I can narrow it down somewhat when I get there.   The staff is always friendly and helpful. I've never had anything but positive experiences eating at the restaurant.   My favorite part is dining near the fireplace when it's cold outside.   Outside of the big-azz menu, the only other 'negative' I have about the place is the price of (alcoholic) drinks. I ordered two vodka cranberries for lunch (don't judge me) and it was $13.49 after taxes and before tip. I generally like to tip @ $1 per drink ordered, so $15 later, I felt a little down in the wallet.  To make a comparison, my favorite bar close to home in Washington county charges me $4 for the same drink ($3.50 Russian Standard vodka + $0.50 cranberry + Free ice). Yikes.  I highly recommend Al's Cafe to anyone. It's kid-friendly and has a very separate bar / dining area(s). Tell them I sent you. They won't know who I am, but that's okay. You'll still get good service anyway."}
{"text":"Little out dated. Seems to need a boost. Food taste like normal bar food."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for a family get-together, but the food should be better. The steak for my steak salad was processed meat and kinda made for a crappy experience being that i thought i would get some juicy yummy steak. Service was good."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly and attentive service, good value for tasty food: we'll be back."}
{"text":"I want to commend Al\"s on their great food, staff & Manager !!! I booked a party there, last minute...they graciously took my reservation, less than half showed up..I was embarrassed & they dismissed it, like it was nothing....Took care of our guests with fab food & the evening was fantastic....Thank you, Al's !!!!"}
