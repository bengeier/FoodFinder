{"text":"My parents were in town and I took them here to treat them for lunch. We had a great meal! All three of us had the buffet. The butter chicken and the chickpea curry were my favourites. I found the curry selection overall to be diverse and very good. They bring tandoori chicken and Naan to the table. The naan was probably the best I've ever had. The dishes aren't spicy-hot, but I expected that at a buffet and it was good for my dad who is new to Indian food (and very much enjoyed the meal). If you are ordering takeout, you might consider asking for extra spiciness. The restaurant inside is nice and spacious - lots of room for strollers for any local moms. The couple that runs the place are lovely. They served us a delicious spiced tea, made from fresh herbs, which was the perfect complement to the meal.

Overall, an Indian feast of tasty, home-cooked food for $11 per person. What's not to love!"}

uhh...I THINK NOT!!!

If i could give a 0 i would.

My friend and I ordered take out for dinner yesterday. We ordered the Dhal soup, Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, 2 plain naans and pulao. There was only 1 group in the restaurant. 

-food at the buffet was not fresh
-the guy taking our order was rude
-ripped us off! my friend's bill was suppose to come up to max $17, but he charged over $20
-some stuff on the menu wasn't even spelt properly (c'mon...even I know the spelling, jeeze)
-when we ordered the Dhal soup, he took it from the buffet and just warmed it up instead of making it fresh
-$3.99 FOR RICE!?!?!?!?!? WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!?!?!?!? how can that be way more expensive then the veggie samosas!?!?!? C'MON...RICE!?!?!?!!?
-Dhal soup was not even soup! it was SO thick!!
-Saag paneer and mutter paneer was CRAP! paneer was too firm
-the only thing good was the naan
-ohh and get this...when we ordered, he asked us \"would you like it not spicy or indian spicy. we answered....indian spicy...we like our food very spicy....the result....NOT EVEN THE LITTLEST HINT OF SPICINESS!!

-honestly, me and my friend agreed it was like eating BABY FOOD. everything was basically MUSH!

-Bill came up to $35...NOT WORTH IT!!! 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review, it is perfect if:
- you do not really like meat
-like buffet style food

they were friendly and gave free naan bread yummeeee ! and free ice cream scoops
my spouse loved the lamb, i liked one of the chicken dish but another dish did not seem fresh to me(we arrived around 4 pm, starving), i think that was beef, I do not remember, however it is around $11 per person plus tax and tip, so we would like 2 go back again , I think they will have the same selection again, but this time I know what I like and dislike, I remember their butter chicken was not good because it just did not taste like any other b. chick I ve tried so far. 
They have approx 3-4 main courses with meat in the daily buffet to chose from, and 3 kinda side dishes, I liked the potato, and they had spicy chickpeas too, and some rice, also they had dessert gulab jamoon balls, and ice cream
you eat as much you can!

the washroom is not very clean, they had no toilet paper but the rough& thick kitchen towel, did they mean to wipe urself with that ?and then when u flush it the plumber costs more, haha"}
{"text":"Good family run restaurant, food is good and authentic. Service can sometimes take a while if they are busy so make sure you call ahead before you get hungry"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering delivery from here. I must say I was impressed. meat was cooked perfect and very tasty. it arrived before I expected and was nice and hot. Price was on par with the food quality. I will definitely be calling them again."}
{"text":"First visit on January 20th. I ordered few take out dishes for dinner. I've heard great things about this place but  I have to say I was a little disappointed. The butter chicken too sweet, it was spicy and (too) sweet the same time. The Chana Masala wasn't the greatest either. 

But the staff were very friendly and fast. I won't say I will never go there again, maybe yesterday was just an off day."}
{"text":"Well the food was not bad. The food was cold. The service was rotten. When we complained about the temperature of the food, we were told they made the pakoras an hour ago so that's why they are cold and the rest of the food needs to be stirred to get the good hot. We had both stirred the food already before taking it. It was luke-warm at best. The only thing worse than cold buffet, is them not offering to warm your food or fix it any way. We will not return."}
{"text":"We live really close to this place, and it is definitely a jem.  This place is definitely one of the best spots for Indian food in the city.  Tikka masala, korma, butter chicken, vindaloo, and madrassi are all delicious. I am continually looking for places that have better Indian, every where else falls short."}
{"text":"We eat here or order delivery regularly. We usually order off the menu - just ask for it , because the server usually won't offer it. I imagine most of the business they get is the buffet, which we haven't tried. The curries are delicious, especially for the great price.  An unpretentious spot with great food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is PERFECT if you are:

1) Vegetarian (or happy to eat vegetarian)
2) OK with buffets 
3) Looking for something cheap but good

Since I fall in all 3 categories, I couldn't have hoped for something better. Half of the options in the buffet are vegetarian. The quality of the food is good, although not mind-blowing. You get free naan with the meal, and the bill is more than reasonable (for the buffet): 10$ before taxes.

Ordering from their menu is less interesting:  for instance, as someone already mentioned, their rice is absurdly expensive. 

If you go for the buffet and want meat, you will get basic Indian dishes (3-5 options). Nothing original or different, but well worth the price.

Finally, server was very friendly. I didn't experience any of the problems described by the poster below."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Indian food, and are on a budget (~$12/person for dinner buffet), you can't go wrong here. 

We have tried many Indian restaurants in the Toronto area and beyond. All of them charge more than Poonam Delite, and yet many times you don't see the value they deliver in quality of ingredients, selection or portion size.

Yes, the buffet is small \"selection wise\", but all the popular items are available. Butter chicken, another chicken dish, a goat dish, and a number of vegetarian dishes (with chickpeas, spinach etc). I don't know the Indian names for them all. Plus, Naan is included and we even received a couple of pieces of Tandoori Chicken as a bonus.

Arrived around 8:30, so the selection for salad was a bit thin, but we didn't expect to eat salad at an Indian restaurant.

From a spicy heat point of view, all the dishes were spiced for North American tastes. I can see that expats from South East Asia might be disappointed with the degree of spicy heat, but for us, it was perfect.

This is the best economical Indian place we have tried, and if we are in the neighbourhood we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Tried it out with friends while visiting.  Nice spread, great hospitality and good quality for the price.  Best naan bread I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to give this place a shot.. we never see anyone inside that should have been the first red flag. If I knew the butter chicken was too g to be Campbell's tomatoe soup on rice I would have just gone to Sobys and fought a can for a dollar and some rice made it myself. It defiantly lacked all Indian spices. Wasn't terrible but wasn't your ideal indian \"butter chicken\". Will make my own at home next time I wanna spend 30$ on tomatoe soup and rice."}
{"text":"Buffet style Indian. It's fairly inexpensive and the food is decent enough, but don't expect wonders. I wouldn't bring anyone I was trying to impress here, but I go here because it's closer to my place than little India on Gerrard.
They have a weird ice cream rule, where you can only have one bowl of it. This would normally be a huge turn off, but the ice cream is kinda old and freezer burnt. 
Staff were nice, but you pretty much do your own thing. Grab a plate, fill it up and then pay when your done. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is close to my house. It's not as bad as the review I would say. There were times that the taste is not as amazing, but it's decent. I like how creamy their butter paneer or butter chicken. (I don't eat meat but the paneer one is amazing) 

I love their dessert. Gulab jamun and the ice cream. 1 scoop only tho."}
{"text":"Did not even find a table...went straight to the buffet and created the best indian inspired plate.  The selection of curries, vegetarian and some with goat or chicken are tasty and fresh.  I like it spicy, so the mixed pickles were a welcome addition to my meal.  They had the golub jamun but it was served cold.  The fine young woman there ran to the back amd brought me some heated so I left happy and satisfied my indian food craving.  Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here tonight and thought it was really good.  I got the goat curry, tandoori platter and samosa. The tandoori platter had SO MUCH food for $14.95 which can easily feed two people. Hey maybe inside wasn't special but delivery sure was lol. I thought I got my money's worth and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and curry fish are so watery .... and has weird taste. I think I won't come here again."}
{"text":"Service was fast, staff were friendly, portions were large and tasted great!

Not sure why Jenn below is such a grump really

We picked this restaurant after wanting something a bit different - and we ordered through justeat.ca  

The food took about 45 mins to arrive (exactly as it said it would) and we were very impressed!

We liked it so much that we actually dropped into the restaurant the next week to pick something up - the guy who took our order was incredibly friendly and helpful, he even gave us some free pakora while we waited for our food to be prepared.  Once again the food was delicious and everyone was very satisfied!

Thanks a lot guys, keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"There are some pluses to Poonam Delite, but the big negative is the food isn't that tasty.

The positives are that the lunch buffet is 10.99 and the dinner buffet is 12.99 but don't expect anything expansive. You do get what you pay for. We got takeout and the prices are reasonable and the portions are good.

The bad part is the food lacks depth. The butter chicken was more a sweet tomato sauce that lacked the depth of a lot of Indian food. It was very one note, which was sweet, and too sweet. The saag paneer also felt very watered down and lacked punch.

The best I could describe it would be North Americanized Indian food. Someone who likes curries and spices and food with lots of depth and soul should not come here. Other than that it is a fine establishment. I just think they need to tweak their recipes."}
{"text":"Didn't try the buffet (their focus): we ordered from the menu.  Was disappointed by their tandoor shrimp and chicken tikka and their naan; all three were truly sub-par.  The beef bhuna was pretty good.  Liked the service.  Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout. Ordered chicken curry, chicken tandoori, aloo paratha. This is the worst chicken curry I've ever tasted. It was so salty I was unable to finish it. And it tasted more like butter chicken. My chicken tandoori was dry, with burnt spots. Not an enjoyable experience."}
