{"text":"Super staff specially made a wrap - recreating ingredients without the crazy things I am allergic to just from me asking what was in it and saying 'darn I can't eat that' Thank You!"}
{"text":"Great self serve coffee. Good choice of bakery items. I had a sandwich made for me by a very nice gentleman, and I ate it at one of the many tables. This place is in downtown and attracts quite a few people."}
{"text":"Staff super friendly. Got grilled ham and two cheese. It was very good. also got the pumpkin blonde bites and they are my new favorite thing."}
{"text":"I am a soup and sandwich fan year round so this is one of my go-to spots for a tasty, filling  low calorie treat.   Lemonade fans rejoice!   Also, the staff is sweet!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Pretty run of the mill place. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by on Friday afternoon and I thought the place was closed (or closing) at first--there were no customers inside, someone was mopping the floor, and the soup area seemed to be missing a pot. However, nobody said anything to us, so we assumed it was still open.  We both got clam chowder, which was pretty good. I also got a raspberry cheese croissant, and my boyfriend got a cheese danish. Everything was yummy but not exceptional. Overall, Au Bon Pain charges too much for me to go regularly.  They also keep their bathroom locked, presumably to keep non-customers out."}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from a national chain. Better than average soups, salads, and sandwiches. But, the staff here is wonderful. So friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, the layout of the store is horrendous."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The atmosphere is always cool and friendly, love the people!!! I normally order a Chicken Caesar salad with asiago cheese, what can I say other than the best I've had thus far. The broccoli cheddar soup is also a must with the fresh squeezed lemonade. If you're feeling a little daring please try their new lobster salad sandwich, it's to die for."}
{"text":"Visited a second time recently.  The Chicken Caprese on Ciabatta with pesto was great. Fresh bread, fresh cold mozz -- it was great.  The chicken noodle soup was good, too.  While this may be a commonplace chain, I find it very acceptable for lunch.  Maybe a little pricey....."}
{"text":"I always have such a great experience here, mostly because of their excellent staff. Everyone is so sweet, talkative and friendly and it creates such a nice atmosphere for customers. The food is never bad, I really like that they have a selection of healthy snacks and salads as well as a huge selection of daily soups. They all have a calorie count on them which is nice."}
{"text":"Although having family in the hospital is never fun... I really do enjoy the soup and breadsticks here. It is a very small bright spot in an othervise challenging time."}
{"text":"After the first few poor experiences I've had I took a hiatus from this place. The salads are over priced, the employees and service is horrendous, and the soup is never soup, it's either mush or chunky globs of bland cream based porridge.  Today was the last chance I was giving to Au Bon to change my mind, again the employees were terrible. If you hate your job that much please just leave, I give everyone the benefit of the doubt but with this track record it's just inexcusable.  The potato gunk I had today, I can't call it soup it was that thick and revolting, was horrible, imagine a bland very VERY thick cream gravy (almost like jail food - I've never been to jail but I'd imagine this mush is what they could serve) with no seasoning and potatoes that still crunched in your mouth, that was my final experience at this place. I am so looking forward to having something else move into this space."}
{"text":"No more Splenda?! Is this location closing? They don't seem to care about providing what they used to. First the butter pats, now the Splenda. The manager's explanation is that he \"hasn't gotten any in lately.\""}
{"text":"This location is better than some as the line seem to move relatively quickly. I also enjoy adding any sized coffee for 99 cents if you buy a breakfast sandwich. I like stopping in on my way to work for a skinny bagel with avocado and egg whites. It's not to bad, and can sometimes be tasty.  That being said, the food is way overpriced for the quality. The create your own salad at lunchtime option is nice, but for $7.99, it would be nice to have fresh lettuce. The roast beef sandwich with herbed cheese is another go to, and I have never been let down by this sandwich. However, it really is overpriced.  The soup selection is good, however, if you're in the mood for mac and cheese, get there early because it usually runs out at about 12:30."}
{"text":"I think the prices are so outrageous I will not give anymore than 3 stars to Au Bon Pain.  I went into to get some tomato Basil soup unfortunately they were not serving it at this location so I purchased to Asiago cheese bread sticks and promptly exited."}
{"text":"I've frequented Au Bon Pain many times, here in Cleveland and also when traveling.  This is my first visit to this location which is located across the street from where I work.   The place is small but efficient.  My co-worker and I snagged the only open table available, as we walked in the door.   The set-up is a little confusing in regards to placing your order and checking out.   I ordered the Peanut Thai Chicken Wrap which was just ok, nothing spectacular.  The ingredients were fresh and included asian components like wonton strips and a thai peanut sauce, not much chicken.  The wrap was $6.99, which is a little bit pricey, but all-in-all this was ok for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is great. I really love the caprese sandwich. The service is HORRIBLE. I am ignored every time I walk in. No one ever says hello and when I'm asked for my order it is done in a very unprofessional way. The crew talks on their phone in the open and eats while they're working. They're loud and rude and I really hope that something is done about this."}
{"text":"I am a member of their club, so every year I get a coupon for a free sandwich or salad.  Last year I got a fairly unremarkable sandwich, so thought I'd try a salad this year.  I went on a Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. to miss the lunch rush.  The staff outnumbered the patrons.  The staff were milling around, drinking from au bon pain cups, clearly not thrilled to be there in the middle of the afternoon.  I ordered a Avocado Chicken Cobb salad from the one staff person who was cheerful and opted for a chopped salad.  There were no avocado and no tomato  in this salad.  Greens, about a quarter of one hard boiled egg chopped up, a bit of cucumber, and about 2 oz. of chicken drenched with dressing.  It was a lunch entree portion, but not much in it and if I'd paid the nearly $8 I would have been pretty peeved.  I later learned that this salad came with a piece of bread/roll, but no one told me/gave it to me.  I did get a medium fountain drink.  $2.24 folks.  The girl at  the check out was pissed that I didn't tell her I had a coupon, I put it on the top of my salad container.  \"It would have been helpful if I'd known about this when I started ringing this up.\"  I'm quitting Au Bon Pain's little email club because their food isn't very good and even for free, the whole experience is depressing and I'd rather go to another \"fast casual\" place like Chipotle where the food is appreciably better.  Sorry, Au Bon Pain."}
{"text":"Locations....in only the best spots! Customer service. ....always on point! Breakfast, lunch or dinner? Yes, yes snd yrs! Bakery items.....you just have to keep coming back to try a new one! Calorie count....heck yes! I base my choices on them! Seating.....people watching seats! Cost...exactly where they should be.  This place is tried and true!!!! Don't forget to sign up for their E CLUB so you can take advantage of money saving offers!"}
{"text":"A very nice place for our lunch.  The young woman behind the counter was very nice and she prepared two delicious sandwiches for us.  There's not really much more I can say - the location was perfect for us, the service was good, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Slightly better than Panera but just as overpriced."}
{"text":"I had to edit this, based on my recent experiences here. Before I was not too pleased with the food, pricing, etc. But recently everyone has been very kind and I discovered how good their bagels were, only if they were just plain with cream cheese. Start adding extras like eggs, etc. it will be triple the price and 1/3 as desirable.  I no longer suffer from the Sto Mach Pain I used to experience after eating here."}
{"text":"ABP prides itself as being one of the country's healthiest choices for lunch.  But you've still gotta watch out though.  Some of their sandwiches like the chicken pesto can still run you close to 700 calories.    I did opt for their 12 Vegetable soup, which was delicious and if there's one thing I love for lunch, besides hotdogs or a good BLT, it's a good soup.  The grilled chicken on ciabatta bread was good too.  I just wish they had a soup & half a sandwich option."}
{"text":"Typically this location does a better job.  They ran out of rolls.  Fortunately one employee was nice enough to help.  The salad was soggy. Overall over priced for the salad.  Not a very good experience today. It is usually better.  I usually give it a 4. Today a 1."}
{"text":"Lets be honest, it's an Au Bon Pain, and it's the same as all Au Bon Pain locations.  You get what you planned on, and it's just as you remember!   What does make this place lovely are the people that work there.  They are so friendly!  I have a strange order - I enjoy a wheat bagel, toasted dark, with cream cheese and cucumber slices.  Many times when I order this, people repeat it back like I messed up and meant to say something else.  Right, because cucumber rhymes with SO much ...   Not here!  The bagel dude said, \"Oh wow, sounds good!\" and made it with a smile.  They also remember their repeat customers, remember orders, and treat you very well.    Happy camper - Stop in, and grab your morning quick coffee and bagel!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of any Au Bon Pain. Their bagels taste like 'adequate' mid-western bagels. I know we have bunches of them in the city. Anyway, we just grabbed bagels in Pittsburgh to go. My sister got a fancy schmancy wasabi avocado and salmon with cream cheese bagel sandwich. Ok. It was pretty good and price wise it was way cheaper than you would find a bagel with fresh salmon on it in New York. I stuck with a plain jalapeno bagel with cream cheese because I wasn't being fancy and it was an expected chewy, doughy mid-western bagel. She also got a small turkey chili bowl. Because hey, sometimes one craves chili at 9 in the morning, right?! I tried it. It was alright. A little bland.   What else can I say about Au Bon? Their coffee is decent. Sister likes to put about a pound of splenda into it so I couldn't get the full essence but I've partaken in a cup or two when the Au Bon used to be open across the street from my office. Pretty sure one of our Senior Partners on a rare occasion used to bring in the cherry Danish pastries from there which are pretty all right. It was clean. It was moderately priced. It was Au Bon. That is all."}
{"text":"I usually hit up Au Bon once every 6 months... When i do decide on it, it's because im either sick or hungover lol. Any other time i just feel it is a little overpriced for soup and sandwiches, but they are so tasty and fresh! Today at Au Bon i ordered brocolli cheddar soup and a mult-grain baguette. The soup was tasty as always and the bread seemed fresh,. The main reason for the 3 star rating is that its pretty cramped in here (compared to other Au Bon's that Ive been too... even food court style ones seem bigger) I was mostly annoyed here, dodging people and tables just to get some dang soup. The line went fast though.."}
{"text":"Can't decide if you want a sub or a burger?  If you're tired of the everyday lunch offerings of better known chains Au Bon Pain can be a nice change of pace.  Their food is slightly better than regular fast food.  It reminds me of Applebees or Chili's quality.  The price is in the same ballpark as those places as well.  Everyone there was helpful and seemed to be in a good mood.  However, the wait times can be extensive if just a few orders go in at the same time."}
{"text":"Everything you could want from an Au Bon Pain. Fresh coffee. Super friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"In the vein as Panera, Au Bon Pain serves up calorie-laden treats that are pretty good, but hardly worth the impact on the waistline. The soups are good (although, I'm not sure there's actually any lobster in the lobster and corn bisque), and I like their Greek yogurt parfaits from time-to-time. If you're downtown and need a dependable and quick bite, it's not a bad option, but it's rarely my go-to lunch/snack spot.   The plus side is that it's quick, but this location is a little chaotic with the way the sandwich line fills up and interferes with customers' ability to access the soups easily and the cashiers being in the middle of the restaurant. The layout leads to lines everywhere and a lot of, \"excuse me\" and, \"sorry, can I get...I just need to grab...um, thanks...sorry\" interactions from the patrons. Also, the grab-it-yourself approach to the pastries, etc. isn't my favorite, either. For something that I'm not going to heat up, I don't like thinking about the free-for-all of indecisive hands picking up and putting back pastries. The plasticware and napkins are also in a weird location (In the corner, near the lobby-side entrance only). For a chain, I'm surprised by the lack of order, but when you're in a hurry, you're in a hurry, and if you've got the calories to spare, at least you know you'll get a consistent meal at Au Bon Pain."}
{"text":"My mother, a 70 year old woman with slight reliance on a cane loves to lunch here.  She loves the Spinach Croissant.  She said she was fortunate to get the last one yesterday.  She said she even prayed that they would have one left.  She also got 2 hard boiled eggs and they gave her Dijon mustard and mayo so that she was able to sit there and make deviled eggs on the way to Bible school...Lol.  She says she wished they would've had a packet of relish, but they didn't.  She also enjoys the people who eat here.  She said she enjoyed talking to a patron from Rochester, NY, about the french culture. The lady told her that she was taught that it it is juvenile to pose a question which Q'est Que Ce...My mother is taking a french class on Wednesday evenings.  I told her Rosetta Stone offers a great intro for free online, but she is yet to get a MacPro.  She used to use her Acer, but I don't know where she put it since she's moved from North Carolina back to Pittsburgh, PA.  Mom says these items do cost more than anywhere else but she does not mind spending the extra. She enjoys sitting at the wooden tables and chairs. Mom hung out from 9:05 to 11:30 just reading her french lessons.  Mom went in again today. She was trying to see the differences in the sizes of soup. She got the Lentil, Curry, Tomato Sauce, and Rice Soup.  She says it was ok, not special.  She says she likes the lemon poundcake because it is very much like her mother used to make."}
{"text":"Going here stressed me out for some reason and i find the chicken to be dry and the prices on the high side for a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"Love this Au Bon Pain and there's three in a 3 block radius of my work. This is the closest so perhaps my laziness feeds into this review a tad.  This location definitely has its downfalls. It's not always stocked at the times I go and closes relatively early. But the workers are great. They are friendly and funny and make me want to return. I've never dealt with the manager but she does seem to be pushy with them when I've been there. But, they get stuff done so maybe that's good but just calm down in front of customers.   I got a breakfast sandwich for the first time the other day (usually do oatmeal but was feeling indulgent). I got the 2 egg and bacon on ciabatta and MAN was it good. So. Good.   Their reusable coffee cups pay for themselves. And their cold coffee you can put together yourself is cheap and delicious. I have not had a chance to try their coffee bar because usually I'm in a rush to get back to work. Lucky me.   Oh, and the Pumpkin CroisBun? Worth the trip in itself and shareable between three coworkers."}
{"text":"Located inside the Cleveland Clinic. It is crowded and poorly managed. The hot food is not kept hot so you could get food poisoning. Go to the hospital dining room for better food choices."}
{"text":"Sandwich makers are miserably slow during peak lunch times. No hustle. They are polite and considerate. Food is good but a little pricey for serving size."}
{"text":"For fast food, Au Bon Pain isn't a bad deal in terms of nutrition (as long as you don't scarf down a bunch of shortbread cookies with your meal, although those things are delightful) or price. However, this location gets a \"meh\" from me. It's convenient to my office, and to a lot of other downtown workers' offices, which probably partially explains why it's always swamped during the noon to 1 pm rush. They also seem severely understaffed. The people who work here are very nice and seem to work hard but there just aren't enough of them to handle the volume they get when they're busy. That means that you will frequently show up to find all of the soups at their very dregs, sandwich fillings out, long waits for salads, etc. Not a bad place for a quick bite, but I recommend avoiding it right at lunchtime if you can! Go early or late.  Tip: Cookies and baked goodies go on deep discount late in the afternoon, I think around 3 or 4, to clear out the inventory for the next day. Just FYI."}
{"text":"Starting to really love this place. Down under Grant Street, a go to place. Breakfast sandwiches are all good. Coffee, the Breakfast Blend is best, decent."}
{"text":"I work in the EQT building that houses this particular Au Bon Pain, so unfortunately I get coaxed into going because I don't have to venture outside in the cold or rain.  Not sure why I get anything other than coffee and a bagel because frankly this place sucks.  I hate to leave it that simply, but it does.  It's expensive, very expensive for what it is.  Close to ten bucks for watered down soup and a bagel?  Give me a break.  I implore you to try somewhere else for lunch when you're downtown, there are so many local places that will feed you much better than Au Bon ever will and probably will do it for half the price."}
{"text":"Being located right in front of my office I end up for lunch here almost every other day.  I'm a die hard fan of the Southwest Chicken Salad and their Black bean burger. They always customize my salad no matter how many variations. Now that may be a standard practice but since they ask me if it looks good before packing it up, that's what I call service!  And oh, the dark roast coffee. Can't start my day without it."}
{"text":"Ever since my work building's cafe' shut down, I lost the ability to grab a quick soup.  In comes Au Bon Pain, within a couple of blocks to the rescue.  Not only good breakfast choices (spinach croissant, bagel sandwiches and coffees) but yummy savory lunch choices (soups, breadsticks, salads and sandwiches) are available for consumption.  Here are my favorites:  Breakfast:    -Iced French Coffee ($.99 when you buy a sandwich!) -Smoked Salmon Wasabi on Onion Dill Bagel  Lunch:  Beef and potato soup and breadstick - Yes!  Dessert:  -Palmier (shaped like angel wings) -Almond Croissant -Harvest Cookie (nutty mix) -Croisbun -cream cheesy croissant bun hybrid  A favorite place now for me and good to note that they close early at about 4 pm so do not show up at 6 pm looking for dinner."}
{"text":"I feel badly that I previously referred to ABP as my personal hell.   I've worked in the same building as this ABP location for over 10 years, and I rarely eat here, despite it being incredibly convenient. I still think many items are rather overpriced and it CAN get chaotic at times. However, I have to say that the employees at this location are all friendly and do a wonderful job of keeping things orderly. Also, I am starting to discover a few menu items that are really good.   My new favorite is the Chicken, Chickpea and Tomato salad, which is a perfect portioned small salad that is only 200 calories."}
{"text":"I tried the Power Protein Sandwich with high hopes. It looked so good, and was a healthy choice. And, it had 3 things I love: cheese, spinach, and avocado.  I was disappointed. The spinach, spilling out of the sandwich, was wilted (see photo). I was really hungry, and I was out on the plaza, but I packed my stuff, and went inside. There was a line at the sandwich counter, so I just went back outside, threw out the spinach, and ate my lukewarm sandwich, which otherwise was okay. It had cheddar cheese, egg, (2) tomatoes, avocodo, on toasted multigrain bread.  But, beware! It packs a whopping 400 calories, 115% of your daily value of cholesterol, and 16% of your daily sodium value. Also, hold on tight; the avocado makes it slippery, and my egg and tomatoes kept popping out. Though I ran out of napkins because of this, I wasn't going  to pack up again, and go inside to get more.  I probably would try it once more, to be fair, and check it before I left the counter.  I just read a review (thank you so much, Huyen!) about the same ABP. No way. No more. Not when there's cleanliness /health issues at that location (625 Liberty Avenue). I really like the one (a lot closer to the Courthouse) at 301 Grant St. Just take the elevator downstairs,  and walk right in. Or, Hello Bistro (Wood Street), just past the Seven Eleven. They have good, healthy (breakfast, too) sandwiches, salads, burgers. Plus, their coffee, served all day, is only $1( No additional tax), and I can get an Eat N Park Smiley cookie to go with it:)"}
{"text":"We  split a delicious, flaky cheese danish. The light glaze gave it just a hint of crispiness. Even at 2:30, there were enough people (and good tunes) to give it some atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife raved and raved about this place so it was about time I gave it a try.   One really cool feature of Au Bon Pain is the app. Download if you don't have it, you can select your meal, customize it and it's waiting for you when you arrive. I can't wait until every place is like this.   They are great for breakfast and have a wide variety of items. Lots of drinks, bagels, healthy choices, fruit, breakfast sandwiches and much more. So far I just experienced the egg white sandwich with avocado! Holy cow it was awesome and you can customize it anyway you want. I chose a croissant with Swiss cheese. I'm going to hit this place again tomorrow. You'll see my check in. Very cool spot.   Heads up, they are a typical downtown eatery meaning they are closed around 2 or 3pm.  Correction!! They are open until 5pm."}
{"text":"I love the Baked Tomato Mozzarella sandwich! It's soo good, and very fresh! Au Bon Pain is a great place to stop for lunch if you like salads, soups, bread and sandwiches! I recently tried the Fields and Feta wrap which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Yet another horrendous experience at this Au Bon Pain location. I stopped by to pick up a quick salad for lunch and dealt with the world's rudest employee. After witnessing her rudeness to the customer in front of me, she gave me the same treatment when she took my order. Aside from her disrespectful tone, she was rushing to make my salad so it was very careless. She drenched my salad in dressing, and even though I told her it was too much, she ignored my comment and threw the salad at me. Literally tossed it at me. The store supervisors could tell I was visibly upset by her attitude so they didn't charge me for my food. I appreciate their effort to make the situation better, but they should definitely not be hiring employees that are rude and disrespectful to customers. So done with this Au Bon Pain!"}
{"text":"Located inside a business building in a food court is this Au Bon Pain. We came here to get out of the cold and rain, and to warm up with soup.  Good news: They have 8 types of soups. Bad news: if you come at 1:00, the soup pots are either empty or picked over, so you pay for waterly vegetables.  Service here was just ok.  There were 2 guys making sandwiches. The older guy (who must be a manager, owner, or supervisor) was friendly and knew what to do.  The  younger guy must be a rookie or trainee, because he had trouble making my BLTA (bacon lettuce tomato avocado) and he looked like he really wanted to go home.  Its a place to grab a bite, but no more than that."}
{"text":"Another chain created for the office dweller, mall shopper. Overpriced but when the weather is shite with rain there's not much choice. The soups are ok with a side of bread. Eh, it's in the tunnel connecting USX Tower to subway system so it's convenient on days like this."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours, 7 days a week in the Cleveland Clinic. It is a savior. You can find just about anything to eat there any time. Everything I ate was good except for the pre-made hot breakfast sandwiches, they were soggy. I recommend ordering fresh from the counter.  The staff is friendly and hard working. I saw one very hard working woman every morning keeping the dining room clean for everyone, filling the ice water, and emptying the trash. It's a busy place, so not an easy task."}
{"text":"Seems clean enough, but the staff gave off a clueless vibe and there was a rind in my avocado breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"We found this gem while in town for a work conference, ended up doing lunch and breakfast there every day for the rest of the week.  Great selection, taste, and a fair price.  Everything is fresh and delicious. Shout out to eric, adrian, glenn, maurice, christina, and amber!  They went the extra mile to make sure we had a great experience each and every visit."}
{"text":"Au Bon Pain is my go to place at the Philly airport and downtown Pittsburgh.  I love their pre-made salads!  I usually go for the Mediterranean chicken salad. I've heard their soups are tasty but I have yet to venture there.  I've had their breakfast sausage/egg sandwiches on asiago bagel! WOW!! filling and super tasty.  Remember to ask for vegetables and cheese on it.  Try their jalapeno MAYO!! Tasty!!  I would highly recommend this place for lunch and for people on the GO!!"}
{"text":"I wish this location had better hours, but the staff is great.  We placed a small catering order.  The staff had it ready on time (6:45 am), with a smile, and as ordered.  Everything was fresh and tasted delicious.  And you have to love those yummy harvest cookies!"}
