{"text":"Decided to try this out rather than go with my usual go to indian food place. We Ordered Chicken TIkka Masala, Paneer Tikka Masala, Chili Naan and Garlic Naan. The Naan bread was awesome, but there was an issue that me and my buddy at work had. THE MASALA WAS WAY TOO SALTY!!! We both found ourselves picking out just the chicken and the paneer because the sauce had way too much salt. Normally i would give this only 2 stars, but the lady at the counter threw in a free desert. The desert was 2 donut hole looking things in some milky tapioca water, it did not suit my taste buds. I will give it another try in a month or so and see if there are any changes. I did like the atmosphere in the restaurant and the people were really nice. 3 stars."}
{"text":"I want to give them -ve stars but is forced to give them a star. A star for  below average food and utterly poor service.  Lets take food. The food was very much below average. -Garlic Naan had no garlic.  -Rice was definetaly not basmati as the describe. They use some cheap variety of rice. - Food tastes as if some amateur guy has prepared it. It lacks taste and flavor - Food does not look hygeinically prepared. - Buffet items are generally never gets refilled. - Dessert looks as if  they were prepared a month ago.  Finally Lets take service - Service is super slow and pathetic. - The server will not even serve you water and you would have to request the water to be served. And by chance you. - Server will serve you naan generally after your meal is over. - If you are at the lunch buffet, the server will restrict you to use service bowls to be used only for dessert. So you end up mixing curries on your plate along with rice and naan. So you will end up eating siggy naans.  On the bright side, their  billing is right on."}
{"text":"I came here for a family event. The hostess was very friendly. We were seated promptly. They did not get flustered and were able to accommodate even the pickiest of my family.   I'm an Indian and so when I have Indian food I'm very critical. I have to say, all the food here is delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Absolutely love it.  We've been there twice now and plan to go back every week or two.  The \"royal dinners\" are to die for.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"These people were extremely rude and wouldn't sell me naan because I didn't have cash. Certainly won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Decided to try taj for the first time and fell in love with all of the choices the buffet had to offer! Definitely coming back and bringing the rest of the family!"}
{"text":"Their food... was average.  The food was delivered in waves. Naan was delivered to the table at the end of the meal.  Their menu selections were adequate.  Their prices.... were okay.  The prices seemed to be in-line with the quality of their food.  Their service... was slow and steady; food was delivered in a disjointed manner.  The server would not accept an Entertainment Book offer stating, \"the 'owner' told me to not accept this offer.\"  Their denial of a offer to get you in their restaurant was obviously a scam.  The server also made a point to leave a cash tip when we were paying for the meal.  That was a classy touch to end the Taj experience.  Overall.... their food was average, their prices were average, their service was average and their denial to accept their offer was shady.  The overall experience gets one star because I can't select zero stars."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets!  Fresh, hot & full of flavor.  The staff is friendly & very attentive.  We keep coming back because of the cleanliness, foods variety & the best staff.  If you haven't been, you have to go."}
{"text":"The phone number is not working and they are closed here on Monday at 8:05 PM  Not sure what there timing is"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I used to come to this place when it had a different name. The selection is worse and the food is very bland. Many better options in Chandler/Tempe area. Lunch buffet $9 but still not worth it"}
{"text":"Indian food has a huge British influence from the days of the British Empire and being English I've eaten my fair share of Indian food, since moving to Arizona my wife and I have eaten at a few Indian restaurants and I have been pleasantly surprised that it was comparable to the Indian food I'd had in England.  I was craving popadoms and the sauces and mango chutney that usually come with it so I chose this place because of the online ordering since we where getting it to go. I ordered a bunch of stuff including 3 orders of popadoms at $1.99 each and 2 chutneys, I expected at least a couple of popadoms per order at the same price as a nan bread.  We went to collect it and when I arrived the order was only just coming in so we had to wait 20mins, this wasn't really an issue as it was a Sunday night and the game was on for us to watch. Since we where waiting and watching the game my wife ordered a crown and sprite with a lemon, the gentleman poured about 3 shots of crown into a small wine glass followed by a small squirt of sprite and handed it too my wife with a bowl full of lemons, no ice! It was warm and horrid! She's a trooper and just chugged it down in 3 attempts, after squeezing all the lemons into it lol We got our food, I double checked with the guy about chutney and left.  We got back to the hotel and became very disappointed to find that 1 order of popadoms for $1.99 was for a single popadom and there was no mango chutney or sauces. Our 2 orders of chutney was 1 styrofoam cup of carrots and a bit of cauliflower!  My chicken samosas had no potato or anything else in it other than what seemed like ground beef. The garlic nan breads seemed to have no sign of garlic. The rest of the food was extremely bland and the rice was not the basmati rice you usually associate with Indian food.  The usually crispy mounds of onion bhaji were a bunch of soggy onion rings. I've learnt my lesson and will think twice about getting togo from an Indian restaurant that I've never eaten at again."}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS- We came here on 9/18/15 only to find a sign taped to the door stating they are no longer in business."}
{"text":"This place majorly went down hill. They must've gotten a new chef because it used to be very good but now not so much. Everything tastes different compared to how it tasted previously. The chicken tikka misala being the main disappointment. it used to be so good with so much flavor but it now is approaching being bland and is also a different color."}
{"text":"We used to come here when it was India Gate. We noticed it changed names and just haven't been on that side of town until this past fri night we took our young daughters there for their first try at Indian cuisine.  The staff is unbelievable friendly and professional. They are truly happy to have you there and you can feel that. They had Indian music videos playing on the tv which made the atmosphere feel authentic. We came about an hour before they close the buffet and even then all the food was fresh and plentiful.    I asked them to surprise me with an Indian wine, they perfectly matched a sweet white Indian wine that went fantastic with all the options on the buffet.   All in all...its the place to go for excellent cuisine, excellent atmosphere, and excellent owners."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nice selection and it tastes homemade. The lunch buffet is outstanding. They also have a nice beer selection. This is my new go-to Indian restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Based on some the positive reviews on yelp, wife and I decided to try out this place.   Sunday night at around 8 pm, there was not a single customer in the restaurant. No take out orders coming in either.   The server that we had for the night was really an odd case. We couldn't understand what he was saying and perhaps he couldn't understand what we were saying. They had a special offer on yelp for draft beer which we wanted to check in and take advantage of.  The server didn't know what yelp was or the types of beer they had in stock on draft or bottled. We asked him to send someone else to talk to us. Seems like the only other staff in the restaurant was the (only?) cook. He was of no use either. We settled on not having beer and ordered ginger chicken kabob as an appetizer.   The good was decent but not great. It can on a bed of lettuce vs onions as mentioned on the menu. The chicken was tender but lacked flavors. Also, wasn't cooked kabob style per se if you know what I mean.   We decided to not order main course, paid the ticket and got out of there.  Summary: will not go back here.   Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"There are two listings for Taj.  Here and Taj Indian Cuisine & Banquet Hall.  Since there are no reviews here I suggest you look for the others and read before you visit."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. The Tandoori mixed grille appetizer was very flavorful and straight off the grille hot just as it should be. The Samosas were awesome as well and the chicken Biriyani was amazing! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Really great food & service - we did the lunch buffet today - YUM and reasonably priced. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch buffet.  Enough variety, but not a ton.  The butter chicken was delicious.  The chicken vindaloo was good, but could use some more kick.  The paneer tikka masala had that nice tangy flavor.  They had some kind of cauliflower dish that I hadn't seen before and it was delicious.  The desserts were average.  The chicken tikka was pretty dry.  Service was friendly.  The place could use a renovation though."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a family dinner and this has to be one of the best indian restuants i have been to in Arizona. I am indian myself and the food to me was very good. The waiters were attentive and very polite. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I work near the place and wanted to try the lunch buffet. My timing was off as I came on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend when many skip lunch and leave work early. I showed up after 1 PM to find the place empty and the only patron there with the entire buffet all to myself...:) The Tandoori Chicken was dry but the Paneer Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma was ok along with the Keema Matar. Nothing spectacular. I've been to better Indian buffets but willing to give it another try in the future to see if the experience is any better."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly. It's a buffet place filled w eggplant, chicken and cheese dishes in spicy Indian sauce and 2 types of rice. It killed that spicy Indian craving I was having. Beer, wine and liquor available.   Happy hour everyday from 5-7pm  We visited on a Saturday afternoon so  Atmosphere was quite, staff was very attentive buffet was full. The eggplant dish was cold the rest was warm. With just us 2 in the restaurant  it felt very stuffy. Couldn't imagine how it would be with a full house.   Overall it's was good and satisfied my craving for Indian food. My hubby was so full and for $30 bill for all we cud eat and 2 beers I'd have to say it we were pretty content."}
{"text":"Love the buffet, the service, location, and atmosphere. Service is fantastic and the beverages were good"}
