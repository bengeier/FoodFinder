{"text":"Went on a thursday after work, and man did we pick a good spot! There was a good crowd outside enjoying the weather, eating, drinking, and playing the cornhole game.  From that, I could tell this place was going to be an all around good time.   We went inside, and would have to wait 30 mins for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar. My boyfriend was happy because sports were on, but I was happy to order my drink.  I ordered the pink lemonade martini, and it was SO good!! It came in this jar, which made me want to send it back, but after tasting it, I was happy I didnt. Looks have nothing to do with it, and this drink def had me in a great mood!  My boyfriend had a corona, and a beer is a beer to me. We then ordered wings and fries. Bbq for me, and honey-hot wings for the gentleman. My wings were very tasty, and my boyfriend liked his as well.  We then proceeded to wind down a little more by taking a shot of Grey Goose. Man did the bartender give us a huge shot! Thumbs up for her!  The whole place seemed to be filled with workers from uptown who just wanted to grab a few drinks, and some food before the weekend started.  I def recommend this to anyone looking for good food, fast service, nice drinks, and a great atmosphere to loosen up after work."}
{"text":"Just had nachos at Mortimer's Pub. Have had lots better nachos at the movies. Real cheese would have been nice. Real chicken would have been nice. Beer was good and cold, waitstaff seemed a little preoccupied. Not sure what other patrons recommending this pub had to eat, presume they had plenty to drink before eating.  Not much more to say. It was a good $7 lesson - don't order the nachos at Mortimer's."}
{"text":"The presto chicken pesto was decent but the Big Easy sandwich was very poor - there was hardly anything in the sandwich besides turkey. The sandwich was advertised as having avocado (one small piece) and red pepper (another small piece) on French bread (this was surely some sort of insult to France as it was really a larger than average hot dog roll)."}
{"text":"In town for a conference, so this wasn't my first choice of places to eat, but when you're with a group, you make concessions.   Being from California, I know that gluten-free menus are very easy to come by in the Golden State, but in the southeast, gluten-free still gets blank stares at many spots. Mortimer's was a good example of that. The host looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I asked about a gluten-free menu. No matter, I would figure something out.   The server was a little better (and actually, very friendly). She at least knew what gluten free was and knew to check with the cook about certain items (the fries and nachos, for example, are not gluten-free).   A wine list? I didn't expect one, but she gladly brought one over after twenty minutes of looking for it. It had two house wines and five other wines. None of them were good. But that was to be expected.  The real problems came when dealing with my sandwich, which I figured could be made without bread to accommodate the gluten-free. It never came. The rest of the party ordered, got their appetizers, their dinners, their drinks - finished everything, and mine still hadn't arrived.  I inquired and apparently (surprise) it was never made. They made it in about ten minutes and it was okay bar food with roast beef and melted cheese directly on the plate since there was no bread. (Most places that do gluten-free modifications for sandwiches put the meat, etc. on lettuce just to make it more visually appealing if nothing else.)  I debated on two or three stars for this review. The rest of my party wasn't that impressed with their food, so I went with the lower rating of two stars, even though the server had a very friendly smile and seemed somewhat apologetic over the lack of their ability to accommodate my dining needs.   Being a bar, it's probably not in their best interest to develop a full gluten-free menu. That's not their real clientele. However, with the Convention Center so close and lots of  hotels around with guests, it might make sense for them to at least educate the staff on what gluten is so that they can easily modify existing menu items to fit those needs.  UPDATE: I've heard from the manager at Mortimer's and I was impressed with her response. She's indicated that the employees have been given more information on special diet needs just so that they're able to be accurate with guests. I appreciate the extra training for them and also that she took the time to respond to my review in such a professional manner. I'd be glad to try them again if I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really wasn't too excited to eat here from the looks of the place. Then I saw the menu... The place was awesome. They have things on the menu that aren't crazy but aren't things you see at your everyday restaurant. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The draft beer was cold and reasonably priced.  The food, however, was completely unappetizing.  We started off with the tortilla chips with 3 dipping sauces. What were we thinking!  The chips were stale and the 3 dipping sauces covered the range from bad, to worse, to worst. According to the menu, the Tassy's Beef on Weck sandwich comes recommended by Grover Cleveland; it may very well have been the last thing he ate.  The Hall of Fame Philly sandwich had all of the ingredients of Philly cheese steak but somehow tasted nothing like one.  It was more like a warm slice of salt block on a bun.  Other than that, the ambience was ideal, if you like music and sports blaring at the same time.  Fortunately, there was a CVS nearby, so we were able buy and toss down a pack of Nutter Butter cookies to quickly kill the aftertaste.  While I feel sorry for the workers at Mortimer's, the establishment would do everyone a big favor by closing its doors."}
{"text":"Door guy and bar manager were both amazingly friendly. Blonde bartender didn't know how to pour a full shot. As a former bartender, she ABSOLUTELY did not pour a full shot in either of our drinks. Super short...WASTE OF MONEY!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a pub for people too stupid to understand what a pub is.  The beer is great if you like warm piss.  The food is good if you like stale dog poop....,which is actually better than the stuff they call food. The waitresses were not too terrible, I overtipped her by giving her 10 cents on a $25 bill....and I usually give 25% tip. I actually wanted a refund.  The bouncer looked like he was late to his prison reunion.  In fact I think he was just released for a charge of grand larceny of life of the bar patrons."}
{"text":"Really nice joint in the Epicentre....stumbled upon this little gem on a Saturday night. Exciting bartenders, cool atmosphere, and feels really low key. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"Was there the night of the pub crawl before st. pattys.  The street and bar were packed.  We got a table outside and did some great people watching.  Menu was simple. Waitress sat down and had a great conversation with us when she wasn't so busy.  Bounces all around weren't muscle heads looking to kick someone's ass.  It was fun to watch the shirtless dancing fat guy try to persuade them to let him stay. Food was great.  I had a BBQ paini sandwich which was very tasty.  Just drinking the green beer so can't tell you much else.  I would try this place again.  It was a good time."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, quick & delicious food. Their beer selection was decent but small but there seems to be something for everyone. Their Panini's are outstanding"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price. The staff was extremely polite and professional. Nichole the manager came by a couple of times to make sure everything was up to par. She gave us some great drink recommendations.  I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Went with three friends to Mortimer's last night as it was our first time to the Epicentre and we were going to grab something to eat before starting our pub crawl.  The location was cute and they seemed to have a good beer selection.  We proceeded to order three appetizers: a single order of fries, quesadillas and their nachos.   We should have left at that point.  The fries were great, hot and lightly salted.  The quesadilla was hot with good cheese, jalape√±os and black beans.  Both the first two appetizers were enough to share between the four of us.  However the nachos left no room for kudos.  The serving size was quite small, the nachos had cold Velveeta cheese or cheese whiz on them and what we thought was finely shredded white cheese on top was finely shredded lettuce.   But they were cold.  No taste. N    The hostess was friendly but the waitress needed some customer service skills.  She asked me and my husband what we would like to drink, failed to acknowledge our friends who were waiting to order their second drink and she just walked away. When she returned and my friends ordered their drinks, the waitress seemed ambivalent about it.  It seems she was more interested in joining her coworkers folding napkins and tableware than waiting on her customers, which is odd because the tableware we got was a sole plastic fork.    I'm guessing this place leans more towards after work or college crowds that want a quick beer and don't care about the quality of the food but only they it is cheap. It is too bad but it is a cute welcoming place.  But to serve cold non cheese nachos, sadly disappointed.  The two stars are for good fries and a cute place.  But the rest of it just didn't appeal to us and we won't be back.  We went to BlackFinn after and had the most amazing spinach queso dip and they gave us extra pita chips."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a reviewer in the last month gave this great place 2 stars based off of his awkwardly skewed perception of the staff at this pub.  After reading his reviews of other restaurants in the area, I find that most of them are based more off of his judgement of people and not the restaurant itself.  I'm glad I gave this little pub tucked away in the Epicentre a chance regardless of his negative review.  In my opinion, the atmosphere was just perfect.  I loved how the waitstaff spent time with customers, including myself.  I heard employees calling several customers by name when they came in, which made this pub in the big ol' Epicentre feel even more inviting.  The food was amazing!  I ordered the Big Diaw with macaroni salad and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who goes here.  The best version of the French dip I've ever had!  Overall, this was definitely a great pick for a night out (even on the week night that I went) and I will absolutely be back in the very near future!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a mid day drink.  $2.50 pints are always great.  Server was great to talk sports with.  I recommend stopping in for sure."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Mortimer's for lunch, and was not disappointed. The service was great and it wasn't too busy, especially for it being the Epicenter during lunchtime on a Tuesday. The sandwich I had was awesome and they even had a special for 25% off when you show them a Northern ID and they accepted my Passport that said I was born in New York.  Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and good beer!    I had a grilled panini with jalape√±os that I ate more of than I had intended!"}
{"text":"Got in here just before the cover charge for the band. Very fast seating and friendly service. Decent bar food...had the Asian Chicken Wrap and the Pretzel Bite app..Bites were good-would recommend more honey mustard rather than nacho cheese. Wrap was fine and I loved that the sauce came on the side rather than drenched inside it. The waitress recommended an excellent beer -  Copper from a local brewery."}
{"text":"Mortimors is a nice break from the rest of the epicentre ridiculousness. Patio is great for amazing people watching as they stumble by in their heels on the cobble sidewalk after too many cherry bombs. Only thing I'd change is the music. For a place that calls themselves a \"pub\" they sure act like a club. Crazy loud even on the patio. Love the scene here though. Def a good stop anytime I'm out at the epicentre."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and service is horrible.  We were one of two tables at the restaurant and the server could not find the time to check on us not even once. Really disappointing, never coming back....don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This bar participated in Pokecrawl 2016 in Charlotte.  As a part of the event, you visit multiple venues in the area and collect \"pokecards\".  They refused to provide the card without making a purchase.  They were the only venue in the crawl (12 bars) doing this.  Outside of crawl participants, the place was dead.  Rude staff, extorting participants of an event that they are a part of.  Will never spend a dime here, and the event organizers will be made aware."}
{"text":"I guess this bartender bro wanted to slowly eat a chicken tender and look at me instead of getting me a drink. Maybe it's because I didn't have a fake rack or a fedora on. Maybe it's because I'm a guy. Maybe it's because I was well behaved. I guess I should've spit on him and quoted a line from \"The Hangover\". On a saturday night, when someone stands at a bar with a credit card in their hand and tries to make eye contact with the nearest bartender, it's because they need a drink. The female bartenders were helpful, though. The Epicentre is like a special ed class on steroids. I shouldn't have even bothered stating the obvious here..... sorry."}
{"text":"Nice vibe and friendly staff. Had a the famous French Dip and really enjoyed their take on it. They add cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce which I wish I had ordered on the side. It was delicious, but the chipotle made it hotter than I usually enjoy. The side Cesar salad was simple but also quite tasty. The turkey soup came in a huge bowl and was meh. My only complaint was plastic tableware which kind of under cuts the overall experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Mortimer's many times before for drinks and food. Honestly, they have OK drinks and typically live music on the weekends that is excellent.   The reason for the one star? Life is too short to not show others kindness, love, and grace. We are all humans with feelings and emotions and supporting and bringing each other up makes this life worth living. The lack of kindness that I received last night at the hands  of the bartender was so off-putting that I started crying. Life is way too short for that and I think my life is too short to ever step foot in Mortimer's again."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection (North Carolina brews are on the up).  Lots of clever sandwiches.  Split a couple with my buddy and would order both types again.  Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I work in uptown, and have visited Mortimer's several times... all of those trips ending in disappointment.  This is just a dirty and dingy bar with people who are wayyyyyyy over-served.  what makes me write this review is my most recent visit:  My wife and I stopped in for a quick drink and some food before our movie started next door.  When we arrived and sat down at the bar, there were SEVERAL (about 7 people) who were all so hammered that you could not understand what they were saying.  I do know that they all worked at the Tin Roof in the epicenter, and all of them said they had not been to sleep yet from the night before (this was on New Years day)....  the bartenders kept serving them shot after shot after shot after shot.  It was a very uncomfortable experience.   ALSO, do NOT order the nachos.... that was the biggest waste of $13 I have ever spent.... AWFUL.  just do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"One of my uptown favorites. Their food is great and the bartenders are fun and friendly. There's always good music whether it's one of the playlists (usually with accompanying music videos) or a live band. Love the vibe here."}
{"text":"In an effort to walk off our disgustingly large valentines day dinner we decided to head over to the Epicenter and try out a few bars.   Our first stop was Mortimer's.   The atmosphere is great. The live band that night was absolutely phenomenal, good selection of drinks and beers on tap. Not too busy. A younger professional crowd which is ideal for me. Mortimer's was a pleasant experience unless interaction is necessary with the bartenders. So there is an implied value that you will pay 11 dollars for a drink which is totally cool, but the service is an absolute nightmare. Maybe it was a off night, but if I want to close my tab and it's such a daunting task that you have to sigh and roll your eyes... It's beyond me. Aside from that I would definitely give Mortimer's another go in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside, mediocre food and drinks but I would go back for a low key lunch on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"I thought this place had a very stellar atmosphere for watching the initial rounds of the NCAA tournament.  I actually went there twice in the same day and was very pleased with the food, drinks, service and overall experience.  I will be stopping by there again when I am in Charlotte for business."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton and wanted to grab a quick drink. So we decided on this place based upon its reviews. Glad we did. Great service and atmosphere. So much for a \"quick\" drink, six beers later.  :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here before going to a game at the BOA stadium.  It's a typical pub but they had a ton of sandwich/burger/wrap options on the menu.  Even the pickiest eater could find something they like.  I got the Kalil California sandwich and it was great.  They partnered with Boars Head meats and cheeses so the quality of the sandwich was good.  Their fries are good (skinny fries) and came out hot.  Service was good and everything came out right and quickly.  Overall I had a good time and would stop by again if in the Epicenter."}
{"text":"Always stoked to try a place that offers a BOGO coupon in the Citipass book. I went here today for lunch, it's a pretty unsuspecting place on the \"slower\" side of the EpiCentre. Funny that Tim G said it was too small because I was surprised at how big the inside was. But I guess lunch time and nightlife wise you're looking at things from a different perspective.  I loved the selection of items they offer(a few items smothered in brown gravy, will have to investigate further into how that tastes) and I had a hard time selecting a sandwich since they all looked like interesting combinations of flavors. I went with the WWIII which was out of this world. My friend got the nachos, normally, I never have a negative thing to say about nachos (since it's kinda difficult to mess them up) but these were less than stellar. The chips had a funky taste to them and covered in Velveeta like cheese sauce. I love Velveeta as much as the next person  but it was more along the lines of not fully melted and hard (yet not lumpy), ick. Very rarely do I have nachos that don't meet my low standards on the nacho scale but these were at the bottom of the totem pole in my book. Prices are reasonable and service was attentive and quick but for some reason, I'm sitting on three stars for now as opposed to four.  They have cutesie names for a number of items, they are a pub and have some Rat Pack memorabilia on the walls so I am still scratching my head with what their theme is? . However, the randomness that is Mortimer's could bring me back. A solid spot for lunch, I would definitely check this place out again for lunch in a pinch."}
{"text":"They cater to our building every Tuesday and I must say I can't wait for my club wrap. Delicious! Wheat wrap packed with ham, turkey, lettuce, cheese and honey mustard. I am not a honey mustard fan at all but I love the taste on this wrap ... A bit sweet!   Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good bar food. We were from out of town and chose this place based on yelpers. I had the Presto Chicken Pesto. It was very yummy. Just sandwiches and salads. A huge panini selection ."}
{"text":"$2.00 charge for one ice cube in my scotch.   Nothing says \"corporate America\" like $2 per .25 fl ounce of water.   PS: bottle of Dasani - $1 per 10 fl ounces"}
{"text":"Bleh!  Visited Mortimer's during happy hour and I realize it is a bar and I expected good drinks and mediocre food but the food....gross.  The quesadilla I ordered had decent flavor but the cheese wasn't melted and it was barely warm.  The salsa was not tasty in my opinion.  My hubby ordered the reuben which was thin on the meat.  A good thing since it was chewy anyway.  There was a fun atmosphere as everyone seemed to be having fun but I would only recommend this place for drinks."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Mortimer's. It is on the quieter side of the Epicenter, across from Coldstone, and its appearance is unassuming. In fact, nothing about the restaurant really jumps out, but it is always a good place for a late night snack. The music is great (lots of stuff I remember from the late 90s, early 00s) and not as loud as it used to be. Maybe they listened to Yelp on that one ;-). The food is consistently good, and the drink specials are ridonculously cheap. $2 beer in a place that doesn't smell like frat-boy urine? Yes please!"}
{"text":"This was one of the only places in the epicenter open late on a Sunday. The bartender was super nice and one of the best bartenders I have ever had(I'm not sure of her name but she had really short hair). The rest of the staff was nice too! The food was delicious I had a buffalo chicken wrap but the caesar side salad was not that good. The drinks were amazing!!! I love that the place has an outside area to sit."}
{"text":"Big fan of Mortimers. Went here the day after Thanksgiving. Enjoying a nice PBR to start and some OMB on tap to finish. The staff is friendly and the owners are involved in the success of the place! The menu is creative and good. Went with a recommendation and one of their signature sandwiches; the Diaw. Roast Beef panini with swiss and au jus on the side. So flavorful...highly recommend. A true pub feel in the heart of the young & dumb environment of the other bars in the Epicentre. I'll be back for sure and so should you :)"}
{"text":"Mortimers is one of my favorite hangouts and the food and drinks are always superb. Its our go-to place because we know we will have a great time, enjoy great food and a casual, upbeat atmosphere. My favorite item on the menu is the North Brunswick. Ask for it on a panini and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our server was great, she answered all of my menu questions. We were both pleased with our sandwiches. They tasted fresh and came out super quick. The smell of the restaurant was... different. But overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Pretzel bites not bad, beer is good, love Stella on draft, good band"}
{"text":"I'm starting to like Mortimer's more and more. I usually will stop by here after work to meet with friends and have a few beers. I have only eaten once but what I did eat was very good. Their menu is surprisingly large and has a great selection.. it didn't look like your typical bar menu. The bartenders are friendly and introduce themselves to you. It seems like a good portion of the clientele here are  semi-regulars, which says A LOT about a place in the Epicentre. Mortimer's is much smaller than all of the bigger bars, like Black Finn, but it makes it much more enjoyable. There is a small roped-off patio section right out front in the cobble stones of the Epicentre where you can do some pretty amazing people-watching. They also have some pretty solid drink specials here. Heads up: I am pretty sure that they get very busy for happy hour and prime time Epicentre times, so the atmosphere could be very different in those times compared to other down times.. but they are both fun!"}
{"text":"Aside from it being in the EpiCenter, this is a cool place to hang out. Haven't tried their bar food but it is a medium sized space with plenty of seating and good drink selection."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. It's never disappoints. I have always received a warm welcome and been helped very quickly. I have only ever been to the bar. The staff always seems to be smiling and happy. Very important to me. The food is delicious and the music is great! I always recommend others to go here. I love it!!"}
{"text":"So honestly, pub food isn't my thing.  But I was with a group of friends and they all decided to go to Mortimer's.  The hostess had to break-up are group into two tables (we were a large group), but was later able to combine us closer together.  Various appetizers were passed around the tables and everyone seemed to enjoy them (I don't like fried pickles).  Ordered the six-piece of Weesie's Wings in bbq and buffalo sauce.  The wings were not drenched in sauce, which is good; making it easier to use my patent one-hand wing eating style on them.  Overall, they were good though a tad on the high end for just six wings.  But what really brought the house down for my friends were the County Fair Funnel Straws, which were amazingly good... never had funnel cake in straw form.  Overall, I give it three stars.  The wait time was a bit longer than expected, the service was a little slow in the refill area, and the TVs were not calibrated making them VERY BRIGHT in a dimly light area.  The food was good, but not amazing (except the funnel straws)."}
{"text":"Solid food options and a convenient uptown location. They have a definite lunch rush, but it moves around quickly so you won't have to wait long for a table. Limited vegetarian options, but they're pretty good so I didn't mind. Looks like they have a good bar area and TVs for watching games -- I'd love to come back for a happy hour or to try more of their lunch options!"}
{"text":"After hearing one of my co-workers rave about this place and it's Beef on Weck for a week or two, I figured I'd give it a try (if for no other reason than to figure out WHAT the heck \"Weck\" was -- apparently it's short for kummelweck, which is the type of roll used). I arrived with every intention to get the Beef on Weck, but after some deliberation and no small amount of waffling between all of the delicious-looking sandwiches, I went with the Coach Magazu BBQ Chick (it's almost impossible for me to resist a sandwich with \"bacon\" and \"BBQ\" in the description).   I took it to go, which was pretty quick...no complaints about the service from a carry-out perspective. The hostess and waitress were very friendly while I waited, and soon enough I was back home, taking my first bite...and my expectations were exceeded! Yes, it sounded delicious...but I think we all know that you can't necessary judge food by it's description. This, however, was delicious in every particular...the chicken, sliced deli-style, the cheese, the BBQ-sauce....so. good. yum.   All in all, the couple experiences I've had with Mortimers (all carry-out) have been great...and who knows, maybe someday I'll even get around to trying the sandwich that prompted my trek to Mortimer's in the first place!"}
{"text":"Great booze, ambiance, decent food and great advice from the bar tenders of what to do in Charlotte (thanks again!)"}
{"text":"This was the perfect pub after a long day of travel.  It was a little heavy on the suit and tie happy hour crowd, but I found a spot at the bar with no problems.  I had an excellent sandwich and a cold beer and felt so much more relaxed after an exhausting day.  It was also within walking distance of my hotel so I got to walk a bit in Charlotte's pleasant weather and take in some of the downtown atmosphere.  I'm rating this place high because they had the trifecta, good food, good service, good environment."}
{"text":"This past weekend, Tim's college roommate  was in town for a visit and had never been to Charlotte before so we took him down to the Epicenter to get a little taste of Charlotte. This little visit was on Saturday from around 2-4. We sat outside and enjoyed people watching and chatting.  We decided to order a couple of beers and some tasty appetizers. We were totally bad and ordered fries, fried mac & cheese, parmesan encrusted mozzarella cheese sticks, and chicken parm sliders. Yikes... not the best food choices! And on top of that, there was a ton of food! Everything was good... but I would have to say chicken parm sliders & fried mac & cheese bites were my favorites.  Since we were outdoors, our service was a bit slow, but not terrible. All in all we had a good time and enjoyed the food & bevvies. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings and fries - both were served cold and stale, the sauce (whatever the heck it was) didn't even taste good.   Service wasn't good neither.   Not sure how this place has gotten 3.5 out of 5 stars, but I'll probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"Only had the Bloody Mary's, but unanimous 4-star rating from our group of 5.  First batch was actually 4-1/2 stars, 2nd batch = 4 stars.   Still not a bad average!  Decent pub atmosphere.  Around a dozen beers on tap."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the Epicenter but if I'm going there this is the place you will find me at.  Mortimer's is a great place to grab some drinks and a bite before a movie or event close by.  They have a few tables you can grab to sit on the patio outside where you will enjoy some great people watching.  The bartenders are always friendly and you never have to wait an hour to grab a drink like some of the other bars at the Epicenter.  The crowd is diverse between the young,  the old, and the in between.    The food is what you would expect from a bar nothing to brag about but decent and the drink prices are just right!"}
{"text":"Great location in the Epicentre. Good atmosphere, both interior and outdoor seating. Initially had a pretty crummy impression of this place after walking through during some crawl a while back. Just awful service at the time. Figured I'd give them another shot due to circumstance of possibly being overloaded by the crawl crowd.   So I stand corrected. Now given this was a Sunday night so I still have yet to see how they operate during a standard Friday or Saturday night, but I was impressed with service and correspondence thusfar. Still have yet to try their food.    Suppose it's always good when your CM vouches for management too."}
{"text":"Great pub! Knowledgable bartenders, great selection Of beer and food, friendly staff. Great place for acoustic music!"}
{"text":"Great pub tucked away. We started our St. Patty's Day celebration here just to grab a quick bite. Then ended up staying half the night because it was so fun. I wish I lived closer to uptown to make this a go-to pub."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch spot in the Epicentre.   Large variety of sandwich, wrap, etc, choices.  Prices are reasonably and the service is friendly.  They run a LivingSocial instant sometimes, so if you can get that, I would suggest you go."}
{"text":"I had a dragonberry punch of some sort in a mason jar and the boyfriend ordered Blue Moon. Also ordered a salad and nachos.  I feel like both the drink selection and food could be better but the prices are reasonable for what they do have.  Atmosphere is great though, packed on a Thursday night with music videos playing on big TV screens.  Solidly a three star bar."}
{"text":"Great place... good people, fun atmosphere, fair prices, yummy drinks, and live entertainment! Other than that, I don't have much to say since we only came here for drinks."}
{"text":"My buddies and I were in town for our fraternity convention last weekend and Mortimers was our most frequent stop. Mortimers had a great atmosphere, with live music at night and a very relaxed vibe when we stopped back for an early lunch.   The food was great, as everyone tried a different sandwich there and everyone loved what they got. The drinks were just as good; their pitcher selection could have been a bit more expansive but the price was right and the beer was good. The service was good and I would definitely recommend it to anyone stopping through the Charlotte Epicentre."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour while in town with a friend. They were out of my first beer choice. Stuck with 420 after trying a local beer. Decent beer selection. I ordered the roast beef sliders and they were excellent. My friend had the wings and she seemed to like them. Overall a solid place."}
{"text":"My partner and I just wanted to go sit down somewhere outside to talk shop a bit and gather our game plan. We were greeted with a very nice waitress who was prompt and polite, I ordered the revolutionary roast beef roll and I must say I was actually impressed with this roll. The flavors hit your mouth in perfect order....it wasn't loose and it wasn't tight...I feel like Goldie locks when I say it was just right.  I think one of the best things about our experience is that the waitress asked if we were doing well at all the right times, unlike other places where they ask you as your trying to choke down your last bite to answer...NOTE TO SERVERS....people hate that....if someone has food in their mouth all you have to do in show you came by lol...anyway this was a perfect place mid day to have an intermitten meeting ...thank you mortimers...you never disappoint"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Mortimer's Cafe & Pub at the Epicenter over the weekend. Not bad at all. The sandwiches were very tasty, and very reasonably priced especially nice since we were downtown where everything is more expensive. The service was good (not Great). I had a french dip type paninni  thingie and it was very fresh and yummy. Hubby enjoyed his pulled pork. Most of the sandwiches were between 8-10 bucks. Margarita's were good too."}
{"text":"Cute little spot for being located in a mall. It was pretty quiet inside for a Sunday night, not many around. Their draft beer menu was not up to date. When I asked for a bottled beer menu the waitress pointed to a shelf across the bar with bottles displayed on it... (I am brand centric and have amazing eyesight, but that's not the point). We ordered, after she dropped the drinks, we gave her a credit card and asked to start a tab. She ran the card and dropped the check on the table. Never asked how we were, if we wanted anything else, no thank you, nothing. It's a shame because we might have gotten another round, and she would have made more money. But instead we left and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sandwich I had here.  Considering the location, the price is pretty reasonable (for lunch, at least).  It's very packed during lunch, so that tells you about the popularity."}
{"text":"It's loud in here. Loud. Did I mention it's loud? 'Cause it's loud. Now, I admit I may be gauging this on the idea that I hit this place on the equivalent of Super Bowl Sunday around here: race weekend in the Epicentre? Locals would know better, I didn't. But at the very least, I can say I ventured into the belly of the beast for what turned out to be a couple of beers and a BLT.  I've since come to understand a couple of what appear to be semi-universal CLT truisms: if it's race week here, expect things to be crowded and loud. And if you're in the Epicentre on race week, expect to be in the middle of loads of corresponding activity. That said, the arrangement here is fine: lots of wrap-around bar, cafe tables and a small outside patio area (so as to take in the festivities). They're doing things by-the-book with the flat screens and some unchallenging menu items, and my guess is that the regulars who stop in are looking for something a little predictable. And predictable would have been fine. If standard was more along the lines of what I was craving."}
{"text":"Even though this establishment is in the Epicentre it feels like it's in its own space. I enjoyed the two appetizers that I had (pretzels and pulled pork sliders) and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed my experience so much that after walking around Charlotte for a few hours, I ended up spending the rest of my evening back at Mortimers. I will definately go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good chill bar. Go every time  I am in Charlotte.  Close to everything in downtown - restaurants, hotels, etc."}
{"text":"Fried pickles, North Brunswick panini, and Slammin' Sammi....say no more. Best place in the Epicenter for sure...not filled with DBags or Dballs..."}
{"text":"I really like everything about this place.  The setting is great.  Sitting outside where you feel like you are in alley while being able to people watch is awesome.  I had a beer and the Pete Rose in Cancun panini.  Mortimer's knows how to make a good panini. The panini was an awesome combo of steak sandwich, nacho cheese, jalapeno, and au jus sauce.  The taste blended together so well that after this review im probably going to get another one.  The costs was $9 which isn't that bad.  Our server was great and its a great place to stop at if you are near epicenter."}
{"text":"My friends and I were browsing around the epicenter to find a decent place to eat without a long wait on a busy Saturday night (7:30pm). Luckily, we were seated within 15 minutes at Mortimers and greeted by our super friendly server, Brittastic (I'm just quoting the receipt).   The menu here is huge and unfortunately, there weren't too many recommendations on Yelp (I guess people come here more for the social drinking, which I can attest to the fact that it is a nice place to do such a thing). We started off with a disco fries (a.k.a. poutine) as an appetizer. It was tasty but could have used more cheese! Also, the fries... well let's just say they were reminiscent of McDonalds. For my entree, I ordered the chicken BBQ panini with a caesar salad (~$9) and a pink lemonade martini. When you order your sandwich/panini, don't forget to ask for a pickle on the side! It's free and although it's hardly a specialty there, it goes well with sandwiches. The panini was nice and toasty on the outside and successfully cured my craving for barbecue sauce.  The caesar salad was your typical--not good, not bad, tasted like how it was supposed to. My friends also recommend the Beef on Weck. I must have misread the martini on yelp but when I ordered it they were able to make something ($5 shot of citron on Saturdays + $2 fee for martini). It was tasty and not too strong. They also have $3 beers on Saturday (and various other drink deals every other day of the week). Serving sizes are a bit larger than a single meal, I barely finished. The food wasn't amazing, but I guess it's good bar food without going gourmet.   Overall, bring friends and an appetite. The crowd here is mixed--bachelorette party,  people off work, loud rambunctious folks, and more. It's an interesting place to be and a nice place to kick back."}
{"text":"A colleague and I had a lovely business lunch at Mortimer's. Pub feel with lots of TVs and a casual atmosphere. I would have loved a drink but, alas, I was working. The chicken giro pita was yummy and came with a side of hummus and pita points that were yummy. Service was quick and efficient. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Like really good, especially food-wise. Came here on a Thursday night (rainy at that) and it still had a pretty decent crowd. I would say that the vibe of this place is casual but there were tons of guys here just getting off work that had the preppy look down (no offense...). My bf and I ordered appetizers and drinks. I got the Mac and cheese bites and he got the chicken parm sliders and we shared a side of Fries. Easily some of the best appetizers we've had, full of flavor and served fresh and hot. The drinks on the other hand were just OK, which is why I deduct a star. Mine was so sweet I couldn't finish it because it started to hurt my stomach so bad (it was just a tequila sunrise). Bf got one of their whiskey speciality drinks which he said was okay but nothing special. Food was spectacular though. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"OK so this place is cool and very nice.  It is a 3 star place I feel, but I threw on the extra star because they use Boar's Head deli meats in all their sandwiches.  This makes a huge difference.  I am very picky and do not like slimy turkey and the like so this really made a big difference and very noticeable if you eat at other sports bar type places, not just in Charlotte, but anywhere.    Everyone was very friendly and felt like could be at home in here.  I feel like I would come here with friends for an informal dinner as it's truly a pub.  I wound not bring the grandparents for a 'nice' dinner here if you know what I mean.  I tried the chili here too and I have to say I liked the chili better across the street at Carolina's Ale House.  It was just a little to watery for me, but not horrible.  I got a panini and it was very good.  Menu is very large with so many specialty sandwiches and panini's.  I very much look forward to going back and trying more items."}
{"text":"I didn't really want to go here but was overruled. Beer wasn't cold enough. Awful music and way too loud. Got the pizza panini.  It was okay. The side Caesar very bland. While I know it was bar food I have had much better. Left with a headache from the terrible loud grinding music. And this was in the afternoon...."}
{"text":"came in here a few times during NCAA Tourney.  really like the vibe and decor.  good beer/liquor choices and service was good across the board.  food menu was varied and a step up from normal bar food.  only thing I would change is they are losing so much space due to the bar being like 4 feet in width.  bartenders have trouble hearing you, handing you your beers, and placing your food close to you, etc...  they did a great job of changing channels for all the games which was nice.  check this place out for sure if you are walking around the epicenter."}
{"text":"Best bar we went to in Charlotte! The service was awesome and the food was delicious! What more can you ask for? We will certainly come back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Epicenter is a four-letter word in my household.  Seriously, I make the cat sit in the corner if she even meows it under her breath.  Make her THINK about what she said (my mom would add, \"you cannot take things back that you say.  it's like trying to put toothpaste back in a tube\").  But my buddy, Travi the Rabbi, and I venture down to the Epicenter to visit Mortimer's every now and again for lunch.  As it IS the Epicenter, the help is usually clad in tight bar logo'ed tank tops and jean shorts which is a nice break from corporate casual.  Although, last time, two out of the three waitresses were preggers, giving them three huge tank top protrusions instead of two.  Something in the water?  It is usually crowded there for lunch and a few times we have been banished to the two tops attached to the wall on the opposite side of the bar.  The artwork isn't bad with the smatterings of drunken WC Fields quotes on the walls (my favorite WC Fields quote isn't represented though: \"a woman drove me to drink and i never had the chance to thank her\").  The food.  Carter's Honey Turkey with bacon isn't too bad.  The standard center loaded deli sandwich with some good flavor.  Jeremiah's Bell Tower leaves me in search of solid chicken salad, but it is an okay sandwich.  Nothing amazing flavor-wise.  The Chicken Nacho Wrap is just weird.  Call it a burrito with tortilla chips smashed inside and be done with it.  And its messy (Dry-clean only means this shirt is dirty - Mitch Hedberg.  This pertains to a lot of my work shirts and I don't want to run the risk of a stain).  The Big Easy is a pretty solid wrap with good flavors.  The sides leave a little to be desired with heavy mayo based pasta salad, potato salad, or fruit salad that all come in little jello shot cups.  So get the chips.  To sum it up, the menu has enough options to keep me coming back on the periodic basis that I do and the service doesn't irritate me.  Now, if you catch me there AFTER work, smack me and send me to the corner with the cat...."}
{"text":"I love everything about Mortimer's, each time I visit Charlotte I love to go here. They have excellent food and the atmosphere is great. Depending on the night you go it can be chill with live music or very very crowded. I recommend their wraps and also their fried pickles.  The staff is very nice and helpful, I was here one night with a girlfriend of mine and we had a few guys who wouldn't take no for an answer. One of the guys who worked there came over pretending to know us and got them to leave. Good group of people."}
{"text":"This is definitely the sort of place you go to people watch, rather than to eat. Drinks were relatively cheap but the food was not anything to write home about. In fact, the cheese that came with the nachos came out cold. Most of the waitresses were drunk as well."}
{"text":"Staying at the Epicentre during the October race weekend, my buddy and I decided to come in here after the race. Sunday night, this was the only place that wasn't crowded so we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar.  The place was really small so I can see how this place could get crowded but there was nothing going on as the other reviewers have posted such as live music or other entertainment. There was the one drunk feller and his buddy next to us who were REALLY loud so I guess that could pass for entertainment.  I thought because of the layout that this was supposed to be an Irish bar. It might not be, just an assumption on my part. I was hoping to get a Guinness or a Smithwick but unless I missed it, they pretty much carried the local brews and a couple of macros on tap.   The major problem I had with this place was the lighting. So dark sitting at the bar, I had to use my phone to see the menu. I wonder, if it was this dark at the bar, it must've really been dark at the tables. We ordered some fried pickles and I had a club sandwich. I've had better pickles but the club was decent.  The bartender was cool as most are and a decent enough place to visit but I probably won't be back. More of a college crowd and business traveler type patrons."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Walking in, I felt transported to an older America....great decor. The staff are all super friendly and helpful, and the sandwiches rock. The chicken Parmesan sub was delicious and huge. The boyfriend really dug their New Brunswick sandwich. The fries are freaking amazing. I really like this place and look forward to going back, bringing friends and family."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  I went on a Wednesday, around 9.  Great (late) after-work crowd...it was packed.  The staff was quick & courteous. The environment was pleasant. Half sports bar, half old-school euro-pub.  Appetizer: The Veggie Quesadilla was awesome! - fresh peppers and jalapenos made it kick. Main: I had the Chicken Pesto panini - added Jalapenos and removed the provolone in favor of the pepper jack... YUM - amazing.  My side salad with Buffalo vinaigrette was good too. Give it a shot. You might be surprised."}
{"text":"Came here with few co-workers during lunch break on Friday. I ordered the Sugar Creek Witbier beer, sooo good. Crisp and refreshing. I also ordered the buffalo chicken panini with a side of fries. Panini was so spicy, but good. The fries were delicious but they were really salty. i would probably go back again."}
{"text":"Meh it's basically canned soup, warm lunch meat & whatever you can cook yourself at home, but it's a decent place to grab something while in the Epicenter. Service is nothing special & yet not bad, atmosphere is the same. Not a whole lot to review, but a reminder for when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not your regular bar fare. .(no burgers, chicken tenders, .)  Sandwiches are awesome.  Waitress very good and attentive. . Here on a Saturday night @ 9pm.  Will definitely come back. . More sandwiches to try."}
{"text":"Stopped in mortimer's for lunch while in Charlotte for a meeting.  We were greeted immediately and seated at the bar since dining room had a short wait.  The service at the bar was impeccable.  Our food and drink refills served promptly.  The atmosphere is extremely friendly and relaxed.  Mortimer's is a great place to stop in for food or drink."}
{"text":"I love going to Mortimer's. The service has always been good and it is one of the few bars downtown that don't charge a cover on weekend nights!  The drink selection is pretty good, they have all the Macro beers and several micros, including some local brews.  The food has always been good, typical bar fare. I would really recommend the fried pickles. They are of the chip variety, but that's what I prefer."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. Waitress was friendly and my salad was very good. Affordable pricing for what it is."}
{"text":"Great experience. Great service and food was delicious. We went to have a few appetizers and drinks before a Charlotte Bobcats game. The BBQ sliders were fantastic."}
{"text":"Thanks Mortimer's for the FREE drinks and fried snacks Tues. afternoon during the DNC!  After getting our tickets for the Daily Show, we stopped in for our first visit to Mortimer's after one of the employees was flagging people down earlier promoting this special.  It was no lie.  A couple of drink tickets in exchange for a business card (or similar information), including the beers on tap (Olde Meck Cap'n Jack) and well drinks.  The place was filled with dignitaries and visitors from around the country, who were also having a great time, shared their stories and discussed views, while inquiring about ours and our fair city."}
{"text":"I know it would be wrongheaded to expect a great burrito from a bar and maybe I should not have ordered it.  The burrito was not good.  It was more of a vegetable wrap.  My date didn't take the burrito detour and ordered a wrap directly.  It was a lonely little thing in a plastic basket.  She described it as \"good, not great.\"  But these facts alone do not earn this restaurants two stars.  Mortimer's gets this rating because they served dinner, on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and knives provided.    The food quality, the cramped quarters, and yes, the plastic silverware all gave me the impression that I was dining on an airplane."}
{"text":"Went over to Mortimer's on a Friday night for a couple drinks with friends. The live music is awesome; no cover makes it even better. I feel more inclined to tip the band with no cover. Traditional pub feel with a large U bar and a handful of tables. A few outdoor tables as well.   It took me almost 15 minutes to get a rum and coke. It wasn't busy, the bartender kept forgetting my drink. 3 separate times the same bartender came over and asked what I would like, only to forget about it a few seconds afterward. I finally got a hold of a different bartender and was able to get a drink.   I'll be back for the live music and atmosphere. Hopefully next time the service is a bit quicker."}
{"text":"This is an average bar. They have the run of the mill drinks everything else there. The service wasn't bad..but it didn't impress me. I do like the fact that they have good local brews on tap. Other than that....you can find a better bar in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Mortimer's is perfect for a bar stop rather it be for a great drink from the bar or top notch wraps and sandwiches. Great atmosphere, TV's everywhere, and great music. The service is excellent and carries local beers on tap. Perfection bar food."}
{"text":"This is my FAV after work place!!!  Even late nights the crowd is a little older and wiser than your typical fresh-faced Bfinn Bud Light drinkers.  I was worried about the service but over the last couple of months they seemed to have figured it out.  The food is fantastic - I love the Midway and the Tricky Chicky Parm, very reasonably priced at $9 bucks.  Great beer selections and daily specials."}
{"text":"I ate the tassy beef sandwich which was very good with a Caesar salad side. Quick and easy and a cool atmosphere. Will go back when in town."}
{"text":"Great food!  The big diaw is absolutely fantastic, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Definite hot spot for after work it appears.  Staff was great here and super attentive even given the fact we had a medium sized group outside on the \"patio\", basically it's the walkway outside but roped off for tables and seating.  I've never eaten here but heard the food is pretty good as well.  The one thing that stands out most is PBR's for $3 (tall boys).  Not bad, and it does get pretty crowded so come early grab some good real estate and let the people watching commence!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I'm in town visiting and my friend suggested we meet her here for some drinks.  We sat at the bar and Sammi (www.sammijo.com) came bouncing over and asked if we wanted something to drink.  My bar mate asked for a beer, and I wasn't sure so I stated, \"Um...\" and she quipped, \"Sorry, we're all out of that\".  Of course I smiled, because clearly we had a bartender who knew what she was doing.  I finally ordered a drink.  What else more can I say?  Sammi was a great bartender, had a lot of personality, and made sure every one at the bar was engaged in conversation and having a good time. There was a pretty rad cover band playing that night too, so all in all it was a great night!!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the menu was extensive. The food was great, but they charged $1 extra to choose fries as your side with a sandwich?? Not special fries..... Just regular ol, fries. The worst part is that the beer on tap was warm...really warm. We had multiple people order beer on tap, different beers, and they were all warm. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped there with some friends for some drinks and food and both were great! Both the food and the drinks were creative and delicious and the employees were a pleasure to talk to. This place has a really cool vibe as well... One of the best in epicenter!"}
{"text":"Mortimer's is a great Restaurant/Pub located in the alley between The Aloft Hotel and The Epicentre...one of those places when you walk in for the first time and you just feel comfortable...venue is just the right size...not too small ; but not massive either and the majority of the space is dominated by a wrap-around bar in the middle..my initial positive response to Mortimer's increased greatly when I saw the two quotes above the bar...\"When I read about the evils of drinking,I gave up reading\" from Henny Youngman and\" Once,during Prohibition,I was forced to live for days on nothing but food and water\" by W.C Fields...I thought to myself I've found my place in Charlotte..it was a great spot to watch all the games and get boozed up for the ACC Championship Game that evening, which was going to be played on a dreary cold night...plenty of flat screens everywhere to watch the early games and on a couple TV's they were playing some great 80's Music Video's also ..drinks were flowing easily and they had a great selection of Craft Beers on Draft with a lot of local ones from Old Mecklenburg Brewery, and I did my best to try them all....the food was surprisingly good as well...had some Chicken Parmesan Sliders early in the day and later in the day got their House Specialty The Big Diaw, which is a French Dip made Panini Style and it had roast beef..swiss cheese..and cajun mayonnaise in it..I highly recommend it....I have to give a shout out to our waitress Natena..as our table grew steadily during the day from 4 to 8 to 10 to 15 she somehow kept track of who ordered what and was always quick with the food and drinks even though by mid-afternoon the place was completely packed with Nole Fans..kudos to Mortimers during the day for playing The Warchant over the stereo system several times which got the whole place in a frenzy..even had a bunch of UNC People come up and say to us you FSU People really know how to have fun and of course they all said Beat Duke....the hatred of Duke is strong in Charlotte!!..definitely had a blast at Mortimer's and will be back in December to get ready for FSU'S destruction of The 2014 ACC Coastal Sacrificial Lamb on our way to Back To Back National Championships"}
{"text":"Out of sheer desperation and at risk for alchohol-induced starvation, we stumbled into Mortimers after an epic Pearl Jam concert.  It was Wednesday night (mid week in banking town) and hard to find a place that would serve food after midnight in Uptown.  After failed attempts at Ri Ra, and some other (already forgotten) bar/grill establishments, one of our group's smart phones led the way to Mortimers.  The late night menu was limited, but that didn't stop us. We ordered and crushed nachos, wings, chicken strips, and some other nondescript bar food.  The waitress kept our glasses full and did her best to bring out the food quickly, even if it took a heckuva long time after we ordered.  But i'm not complaining.  I'm grateful that Mortimers was there to save the day, and may even find myself back there for another late-night stumble."}
{"text":"Basic food (had a salad, it was fine), middling drink choices -- par for the course for a pub, so fine.  But, and I know to some this is nitpicking, but really? Plastic silverware. I'm a business traveler, so, does downtown Charlotte fear the power of people with metal butter knives? Or is it policy to do everything within their power to put more plastic into the environment?  It was a perfectly fine pub experience until I got the silverware, and then it felt like I was on an airplane.  It sets a tone...that's all I'm saying.  Otherwise, food & service were fine.  Neither outstanding nor abysmal...what you expect from a pub."}
{"text":"Good places for drinks and watching a game. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Yet to have food there but have seen lots of people there for lunch."}
{"text":"This classic American pub in the EpiCenter offers good service, great sandwiches and a solid selection of local brews. The Big Diaw is one of the best French Dips I've ever tasted, and the Triple Decker sandwich is almost too big to eat. Their Buffalo Chicken salad, however, was a little TOO spicy, so be careful before you commit. My only complaint is the noise level, which can make it hard to carry on a conversation. But if you're looking for the quintessential pub in Uptown Charlotte, you find a better location than Mortimer's."}
{"text":"If you're anything like me, after a big a big night out on the town, you want something more than some hors d'oeuvres. I'd say go for the real food- protein-rich, light meal.   Roast beef, melted Swiss cheese, and fresh ciabatta roll? YUP. I had the Big Diaw and it didn't really leave a lasting impression, also you're drunk, so basically everything could be impressive at this point.   Daily specials: Mon:$2.50 Miller Lite Pints .$4 Mason Jar Cocktails. Tue: $3 Miller Lt. Btls . $6 Vodka Redbull. Wed: $3 Yuengling Btls. $5 Crown Royale. Thur: $3 Coors Light Btls. $4 House Wine - Bourbon and Blues. Fri: $3 Miller Lite Btls. $5 Jameson - No cover. Sat: $3 Coors Lite Btls. $5 Absolut - Live music. Sun: $3 Miller Lt. Pints. $5 Absolut Peppar Bloody Mary's. Sat & Sun: Breakfast 10a-12p  Three Yelps."}
{"text":"Mortimer's is great! -- The food quality is always above average, and staff are welcoming. It is a bar, so expect bar food, but they elevate the balance between a bar and restaurant. We've been coming here for years, and will continue to return as they keep their consistency. There are occasions where the music might be a notch louder than it needs to be. Other than that, you should definitely give this place a shot. It is by far the best bar in the Epicenter.   Tip: Betsy's Buffalo Chicken Panini, mouth watering. (replace the blue cheese with their homemade ranch)."}
{"text":"So it was time for a drink downtown and Mortimer's came to mind.  The place was packed and not enough bar seats.  The bartender ( I wanna say Summer, but I cannot remember) whatever her name was, she was great...attentive...a little sassy.  I asked for an IPA, which they had in a bottle (I'm not a fan of draft).  A few drinks and this is still one of the best bars in the city."}
{"text":"relaxed atmosphere.... lots of TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  great people watching out on the front patio late night on the weekends"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's going away party, and to drink... but I am curious about their menu and will try to come back at some point to try their food.  This place is pretty cozy.... but for a Thursday night it was a good size... I can't even begin to imagine what it is like on the weekends with huge crowds.  The bartenders were very nice and prompt.  I'll be back... and armed with an appetite for some food!... and some more drinks."}
{"text":"Good beer/liquor selection- friendly atmosphere and bartenders.  I'd rather drink here than Whisky River any night of the week.  One of the best small bars in Uptown Charlotte, don't overlook it just because its at the Epicenter."}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to come back here...  If they turn on the ventilation system.  I know I'm being overly particular, but fry oil haze coating my entire being as soon as I walk in isn't for me.  I had to keep pulling my shirt over my mouth & nose to try to filter it...  but that's just me.  Overall though...very friendly staff, tv's, great music (blues & bourbon on Thursdays), so I will go back, but maybe sit outside if I can."}
{"text":"great service! had the pizza panini and it was phenomenal! stopped in before a hornets game, was pretty packed!"}
{"text":"Vibrant, fun and young but not so youthful that you feel like your are surrounded by 20 year olds with fake ID's. Located in the EpiCentre in Uptown Charlotte, across from the Time Warner Cable Arena.  Good eats, a decent selection of local beers and deals on cheapo's like Coors Light. Try a pickle back? Why not... Have a great time at Morty's"}
{"text":"Great place for both drinks and food! The pretzel bite appetizer and brisket sliders were fantastic. Service at the bar was friendly and fast, even though the place was packed for todays Panthers game. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I promise this review will not be 4 pages long.  Very impressed by Mortimer's.  The servers were very friendly (I know they work for tips) but it was refreshing to see them having a good time.  Nothing I ordered took more than about 5 minutes to shoot of the kitchen.  Their wings are about the best I have ever had.  Sorry that place that rhymes with DW3 - these guys have you beat hands down with their wings.  I ordered a sandwich, drink, and appetizer and STILL didn't spend $20 until I added in the generous tip.  \"I'll be back\"  Oh.  And I went to Mortimer's specifically because of the Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Mortimer's is a spot I've been to and enjoyed before, and so that saves this rating from being lower. However, the reuben is awful and one of the worst I've ever had.  I was looking forward to getting a reuben at Mortimer's as I continued my journey around Charlotte to try them all, but I was very severely disappointed by what was put on the plate in front of me. The menu boasted flash fried corned beef (sounded delicious), but the corned beef on the sandwich lacked any flavor and the person I was with thought it was mushy. The bread was the worst part of the sandwich - it tasted bad. Like maybe it was moldy and had been sitting around for too long kind of bad. It left this awful flavor in your mouth that really ruins your dinner experience. The rest of the ingredients on the reuben were average with decent (probably just normal store-bought) kraut and OK swiss. The proportions were fine, but that doesn't help much when the ingredients aren't very good to start.  This is one of the worst reubens I've tried in Charlotte and I'd highly recommend avoiding it. I've had a couple other things on their menu and their far and away better, so if you stop in for food make sure to pick something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food and good music.  Tuesday open mike night is a great time.  Friendly bartenders.  If you sit at the bar long enough you will get fed"}
{"text":"Lunchity lunch lunch in Uptown...Mortimer's most certainly fits the bill for a super tasty lunch. So, that being said, this review focuses on Mortimer's as a day time eating and drinking establishment, not a late night stop (although I'm sure that would be delightful, too - I just haven't experience it as of yet). So, yes, 4+ stars for a low key and affordable lunch in Uptown. Here's why...  I've been in a few times, but recently Mortimer's changed their menu and now offers a variety of sandwiches, paninis, salads, starters and sides. Prices are right on the money - expect to pay $7-$10 for a sammie plus a side. It's important to note that many of the items here are made in house, like their tasty, light and flavorful chicken salad. No heavy doses of mayo mixed in with that bird salad. Hooray! Oh and I must mention the service. Every single server has been on the money here - friendly, chatty and helpful.   I've tried the Big Easy wrap which is slammin' with a kick. But, my favorite thus far was had yesterday when I bellied up at the bar for a panini - I chose Jess' Sausalito Turkey. De-freakin'-licious. Picture manageable ciabatta with melty cheese, thin slices of spiced turkey, paper thin shards of green pepper and red onion with some delectable sauce. It was seriously good. Side wise, I've only had fruit...even thought I've coveted the macaroni salad. Next time, Mortimer's, next time indeed."}
{"text":"Only been here once so far, but I'll come back. Good local brew on tap. Enjoyed the music and impromptu dance party I got to be a part of. The sandwich we had was tasty and the service was great. Enjoyed the wait staff in their Oktoberfest gear as well :)"}
{"text":"Oh, Sunday nights in Charlotte - when the streets are rolled up by 9pm promptly.  What is one to do if the confines of the house become too much?  I thought for sure the Epicenter would still be alive - especially given that it was Halloween weekend.  I was much mistaken: the only figment of Halloween to be found was the eerie zombie-movie-like desolation, few people out and even the wind blowing a newspaper across the ground while the background music still blared.  But tucked in a corner on the first floor was Mortimer's, an oasis in that barren Sunday desert.  I was very surprised by the small, cozy interior that was everything you would expect a good bar to be: dark wood tables and counters, plenty of things on the walls and TVs showing the Panthers losing.  I didn't order any food, but the bar service was quick and attentive, and the prices were reasonable too.  The bartenders know what they are doing (a rarity in Charlotte).  There are plenty of spirits to mix your heart out and I was happy to see they have Olde Meck on tap.  It was a casual, fun atmosphere.  Mind you, I'm not one to go out of my way to do anything at the Epicenter, but I'll certainly be inclined to steal away into Mortimer's again next time I'm Uptown."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was good, the Big Diaw was recommended by the waitress, Natina and it was a huge hit. I will have it again when I come back. The food was reasonable in price and the atmosphere was King!  We were a group of eight......my wife and I and 6 adult children......we all had fun."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I'd have to agree that Mortimer's is A-OK.  Brought my parents here for a lunchy lunch in the big city, and the lunch food was great - decent portions, decent price, decent service.  Luckily we made it early before it got crowded with the button-up-shirt brigade.  Came here once for an after-work drink with some girlfriends, too.  Bartender was very nice, and aside from some annoying Flyers fans (ptooey!), atmosphere was chill.  Solid 3 stars. Nothing special, but nothing super terrible."}
{"text":"So apparently between 3-4 PM in uptown most places think I should not eat. My friend and I decided to wander around uptown on Sunday to get some food and see what went on during the day on a Sunday (spoiler alert: nothing). We wandered around and found out that a lot of places do not like to feed people during that time, so we found ourselves at the Epicenter due to poor planning, and then at Mortimers.   We got wings and fried mac-and-cheese bites for appetizers, I ordered a wrap with no tomatoes. The appetizers were great, and we had high hopes for our meal. I got my sandwich and..wait, I didn't order a sandwich. I ordered a wrap and that sandwich has tomatoes. They apologize, then bring out my wrap. It had tomatoes. No big deal, I'll just take them out. Except the wrap was grilled, like put on a panini press grilled, so the tomato is all up in there and I decide that I just don't want to eat that wrap anymore. I tell our very sweet waitress what happened and she is very apologetic. I asked my friend how their sandwich was, it wasn't very good, so instead I ate the side salad and the rest of those mac-and-cheese bites and called it a day.   As a side note I'm not sure why I try things at the Epicenter at all really, it's never very good. Also the Epicenter weirds me out because I have no idea what people are supposed to do there except get hammered."}
{"text":"Ever been to an Irish/English pub type of place?  Then you've been to Mortimer's."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, good crowd, live music, sports channels running...what else can u ask for??? good times"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday around 3 to get a bite and drink with a friend. We were sat promptly and ordered drinks..beer and a margarita. The margarita was so sweet my friend didn't even finish it! A beer is a beer so I had no complaints there. We tried the fried mac and cheese bites and they were much better than expected! I would definitely suggest getting them. When we left around 5 the place was beginning to fill up with an after-work crowd. I would definitely go back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Food was cold and 100% microwaved. Service was meh at best. Ordered a drink and it came with aristocrat (took one sip) so I asked for titos. Ended up being charged for both because \"it wasn't her fault\". Will never come back or recommend anyone to.   Side note: it smelled weird, probably due to poor ventilation."}
{"text":"Such a cool post work spot uptown. I visited here for happy hour on a random Thursday with a friend. I had bacon cheese fries and wine. The wine was fine for $4 and the bacon cheese fries were generously coated with cheese and bacon. While there was a lot of the topping, it was on top of a pile of fries, and I think they could make it even better by layering the bacon and cheese throughout the fries. The fries were smaller, like McDonald's, and served fresh. Service was good and the bar tenders were attentive. A nice post work crowd to chat it up with as well. There were signs that indicated there was live music some nights, but given the layout of the space, I can't imaging where someone set up to play. I guess if I go back at night, I'll find out.   The downside here is parking because you have to park at the Epicenter, which was $10 this day and often greater. I called to see if they validate parking because it would have been worth returning to the restaurant, but after several calls and a busy signal, it appeared that the number did not work."}
{"text":"Great bar! Always love the atmosphere when I come here. I like how this is a smaller bar and a lot of regulars come in so it gives you that homey Cheers feel. Love their macaroni appetizer. The best time to go is Thursday night for their blues night. Great spot in the epicenter!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my good friend this past weekend, and we decided to stop by the Epicenter for lunch on a Saturday. I wanted  to try a place that I wouldn't be able to eat at in Chapel Hill, so we both decided that Mortimer's looked like it might be a neat place. My friend had never eaten there either, so we were both looking forward to trying something new. Our waitress was pretty nice (nothing spectacular, but not bad) and we received pretty good service. I ordered Hannah's Wrap (I think that is what it was called), which was okay, but I don't think I would order it again. Very standard, some fruit, turkey and lettuce. They do have a very extensive menu if you are looking for a sandwich, but I noticed  that most of their wraps were the exact same as their salads, just wrapped up in a tortilla and given a different name. I always appreciate restaurants with creative menus, and I felt less than wow-ed by their wrap and salad selection.   My friend ordered a veggie wrap and specifically asked for no pepper jack cheese (or cheese whatsoever). When her wrap came out, it, of course, had pepper-jack cheese on it. I would have sent the wrap back, but my friend is a lot lower maintenance than I am. However, I was a little surprised when the waitress stopped by our table to refill our drinks, noticed my friend picking off the cheese, and didn't say anything...like \"oh no they put cheese on it!\" or even \"is your food okay?\" Maybe she wasn't very observant, but my friend plopping slices of cheese on her plate, I feel like, is a pretty obvious thing.   I did really like the atmosphere of the place (if you're there, look up. The ceiling is awesome!). There are lots of pictures, cool quotes, and just an overall \"pub\" feel about the place that made me feel like I was truly in a restaurant unlike any other restaurant I've been in before. I liked that. Maybe I would have liked the place better if I was there for dinner/drinks instead...however, the last thing on my mind at 12 pm on Saturday after a night out was ordering a mixed drink.   I liked Mortimer's okay, but I don't think I would go back there to eat again. Just not very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch! They have a wide variety of options from apps to wraps to salads to sandwiches and paninis. I enjoyed the pesto chicken panini. It was just right-nice amount of chicken, not too much pesto, mixed greens and roasted red peppers. I enjoyed the fries as my side. They were closer to shoe string style fries and were yummy! The service was excellent-I'm sure this would be a great spot to go for a beer!"}
{"text":"slow service on a slow night. bbq sliders were dry and over cooked - absolutely terrible. there's so many other options at the epicenter that I will never return here."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Our waitress was great. Chili cheese dip was good. Ruben was excellent and the Big Easy wrap was really ood but a little on the small size. Great atmosphere. We would definately go again."}
{"text":"Slow service and waitresses are rude!!  It took us 40 minutes to get our check, and 20 minutes for me to get silverware to eat when the food finally did come. Food is okay, nothing to write your momma about,"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night. Happy Hour! wooo!  - $6 redbull vodkas! FO SHO! - Great place to hang out, pre-game!  - Friendly and fast service.  - Different Happy hour drinks each day."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the old cobble stone street alley of the Epicentre - Mortimer's!  This was one of the first places I ventured into when I first showed up on the Charlotte scene years ago and it really set the tone right. It has kind of a traditional touristy feel to it but subtle touches of originality at the same time.  I would love to comment on the food but I have only abided by the liquid diet each time I have gone.   Mort's has a real nice size wrap around bar that is very spacious and inviting.  The staff is very \"dive\" and really down to earth sweet.  The on-tap selection is a little lacking but they have a ton of local bottles to roll the dice on.  They do pour an excellent Guinness!  Stop in and give this place a try.  Then keep walking around the Epicentre for more!  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Eh.  I've had better food and service at a lot of places; I had to ask twice for them to panini my sandwich, but they were nice about it.  Decent beer selection.  It was packed for a Sunday night.  Lots of locals for the Epicentre.  At least they had the Braves game on."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place has some good things going for it, but it's wayyyyyyyyyy toooooooo smmaaalllllll.   I swung by on a saturday night to grab a few beer's and watch the game. They had a guitarist come in to play a show. Despite being pretty talented, he sucked because the sub was just about in your face.   Kevin N. hit it on the head. It's pretty loud.  They have some good beers on tap and the wait staff is pretty helpful. If you go, utilize the little outdoor seating area. You will save yourself from going deaf and looking like a fool walking around the epicenter screaming.  1 love"}
{"text":"A must-do at the Epicenter. A cozy bar with a hometown atmosphere in the middle of the Epicentre madness. Great beer. Great food. Awesome staff. If you haven't been there yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Best small at the epicenter.  Great lunch and dinner spot. Solid specials. No gimmicks.  No skanky bartenders. Small but perfect."}
{"text":"We are from Oregon and needed a spot to kill some time. This ended up being a pleasant spot that we were not at all expecting. The atmosphere/environment in there was so welcoming and cool. We wish we had one back home. The only complaint I have is I bought a super cute shirt to take home as a souvenir and realized once I got to the airport I had left it on the bar top! Super bummed!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Charlotte for a few years and I heard great things about Mortimer's but walking into the place made me think it was a bit more of bar then a restaurant and it has a less clean feel like a bar would. Well I stand corrected. I had a chicken gyro that was seasoned perfectly, hubby had the Wilber and said it was delicious, my daughter had the nacho wrap and loved it. We ordered the steak and cheese nachos and could have passed on them. They have a great beer and spirit selection. Our waitress was adorable and spot on. I am so glad we made it one of our last places to visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The servers were awesome and never went without a full beer. I didn't get to try the food we were just hopping from place to place but the burgers looked amazing. I would definitely go back if I was in the area again. Oh and they had these super cute shirts with funny sayings that you were able to buy."}
{"text":"The big diaw sandwich was amazing! Great atmosphere! Neat place, and great service.  pretty affordable - and lots of selection :)"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. We were staying at a downtown hotel and wanted a light dinner before retiring for the evening. This place was a short walk right across the street so we gave it a try. We were greeted by a friendly staff and seated right away. Our server was extremely helpful and also very friendly and engaging. We went vegetarian for the evening and had the veggie wrap and the \"hug a tree-a-dilla\" along with a few brews. We find it challenging sometimes to find good vegetarian food when traveling (he's a vegetarian, I'm a true omnivore but also enjoy a meatless meal sometimes). These were two very delicious choices!  The place has a local neighborhood joint kind of feel to it. Lots of TVs for sports fans. It's lively but not overly noisy. I'm a fan, would go back any time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good drink specials. Stopped for a meal during Alive after Five. Service was good. It was still early dinner time and the lights were a little too low to even see our food which wasn't great, but otherwise a good experience. Wraps are delicious!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great and the decorations are even better.  You feel like you are in a cozy European pub.  The selection of beer is good, as well as hard cider.  They have a scotch menu as well.  The food was good, but typical pub food, sandwiches, chips, salad.  I had the Hawaiian chicken pannani and my husband had chicken pesto pannani.  Both were served promptly and were very good as well as filling.  There are televisions all around and the atmosphere is great for watching spirts!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group from work to watch a hockey and basketball game.  Started out great until the 2 piece band began to play.  Unfortunately had to eat and run because our ears were ringing which was too bad as we wanted to stay.  Food, beer and service were all good."}
{"text":"Just came in for a bite of food for lunch.  The place was okay. Nothing wrong with it other than one weird patron at the bar trying to blast a youtube video for 20 mins.    Probably a good place for drinking, but the food was just okay.  Not that big/filling and didn't hit my tastebuds right.  Not sure what didn't jive with me on it, I just wasn't impressed.  Maybe I need to be drunk next time."}
{"text":"Went to Mortimer's first time the other day. The beer selection was good, but the food was mediocre for the prices. The nacho appetizer was dry - it had jalape√±os, lettuce, and beans on top but no cheese, salsa, or guacamole. Potato soup was okay. The sandwich (beef on weck) was pretty good. Overall okay food but nothing great. If I come back it would be for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"I was here for the evening (tagging along on a work trip) and wanted a fast meal (not fast food) with a beer and looking for something chill.   Sat at the bar (by myself) and the bartenders were really attentive, had an awesome Antipasto Salad, and a beer. My meal was very good and the menu looked appetizing with lots of options.  It was a somewhat noisy bar, but that is expected given the crowd, the multiple TV screens and vibe of this place. I would come back with friends and also eat here again. All in all I couldn't have asked for more that evening."}
{"text":"Located in the Epicenter near the convention center, we ate here most days after the show.   Good selection of wraps and paninis  Jamacian Jerk Wrap is tasty Grilled cheese bites app is awesome Pretzel bites app is epic"}
{"text":"The rents were in town this weekend, and after giving them a tour of Charlotte we were getting a bit famished. My father is a picky eater, so when I saw Mortimer's Menu is made up of tons of fresh sandwiches, I knew it would be a safe bet to grab some lunch. Mortimer's didn't only impress the rents but it also made me quite the happy camper.  Located in the Epicenter, Mortimer's looks like a sports bar/ pub, but the menu is that of a high-end cafe/ deli. There were a few outdoor tables, but we decided to eat inside to escape the heat for a bit. There are some half booths and high top tables (as well as the bar), and we were greeted and seated at one of the high tops. Unlike other bar-esque restaurants I've eaten in, these high top chairs were not only easily accessible but were also surprisingly comfy. After ordering drinks we took in the ambiance of the place which consisted of TVs and silly pro-booze signs and quotes along the wall.  As I already mentioned, the menu is more extensive than I expected. There are tons of different sandwiches ranging from simple cold cuts to grilled chicken. There were regular sandwiches, wraps and paninis, as well as some salads to help round out the menu. The prices ranged from $8-10 per sandwich which isn't too shabby for the high-quality sandwich and side you get.  I went with the Roast Beef on Weck, which is kind of like a French Dip roast beef sandwich but on a special caraway seed bun instead of the hoagie roll. The roast beef was pretty high quality and came on the bun all warmed up from a hot bath in au jus. The sandwich also came with a generous portion of au jus for dipping, and the container was actually large enough to accommodate the sandwich. The au jus was divine and really made the sandwich...it was full of rich, beefy goodness. The caraway seed bread was sopped up the au jus perfectly and made for an all around great sandwich. I got the fruit salad as a side and it was a large portion of  FRESH cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple and strawberries. All in all, it was a great lunch.  The miss' had the Presto Chicken Pesto which had grilled chicken with roasted peppers and pesto. Now I didn't think I liked pesto, but I did try a dollop of hers, and then went ahead and stole a few other tastes. It was pretty darn tasty, and now I'm bugging her to make some fresh pesto so I can get the full pasta experience. My mom had the Veggie Pita which was just a bunch of veggies in a pita.I need some meat with my meal so this wasn't my cup of tea, but my mom was pretty happy.   My dad, being his boring self, went with the \"Your Grinder\", which is just a \"make your own plain sandwich.\" He got turkey, added some veggies and mayo and that was it. I shook my head in disappointment as he had this incredibly diverse menu of gourmet sammies to choose from and he went with the most basic of all. Still, he was raving about his sandwich in the end so more power to him and his bland  palate I suppose.   The sandwiches were all really good, the menu was extensive, the staff was friendly and the prices were down-right affordable for the quality. I don't know how it would be on a busy weekend night, but for a quick and tasty lunch downtown, it's the way to go. If it's lunch time and I'm in the area with a hankering for some meat on bread, this is the place I'd go. It's definitely my favorite sandwich joint  down here so far."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  The food was yummy, the service was great and fast!  Great drink selections!!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly crowded on arrival. Live sports radio broadcast event.  Was seated in area near bar and told could order from bartender. Others that came in after us managed to get tables and wait staff.  Surprisingly bartenders never offered any service.  Eventually we found a menu on our own and wrote down our order and carried it to whom I guess was the manager on duty. Food came out promptly.  I had the Big Diaw (Roast Beef and Swiss Panini) with kettle chips. I enjoyed the sandwich, Cajun mayonnaise had a bit more spice than expected. Kettle chips tasted as if they came from a bag rather than freshly prepared as expected.  Other members of my party had the Philly Cheesesteak also with kettle chips (they made the same comment) and Nachos. The nachos were larger than expected.  I'm not sure I would go back with so many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while visiting Charlotte, fresh from the airport and checked into the aLoft.  The atmosphere is a traditional pub setting, and they play lots of loud 80's music.  Luckily, I happen to like 80's music!  I had the French Dip sandwich (can't remember the exact name of it).  I can honestly say that it was probably the best French Dip I have ever had.  The bread was good, the beef was rare, and the au jus had just a hint of spiciness to it.  The sandwich was served with kettle chips, but you have your choice of other sides like potato salad as well.  Very good lunch, nothing too fancy, just right!"}
{"text":"Beware deceptive pricing on liquor offerings.  Standard brands are listed along with booze that costs $35 for a shot and there are no prices listed.  Bartenders seemed to have rather been at the dentist"}
{"text":"Best non-epicenteresque bar in the epicenter. Great food for a bar, the pretzel and mac and cheese bites FTW. Good service and a nice patio."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for dinner during a late night at the office. They have an expansive sandwich/wrap/panini menu with Boar's Head meats (which I love). I ordered the Hawaiian Chicken panini because I'll eat anything with pineapple on it (well, almost anything).  The panini was good but nothing to write home about. Then again, the whole idea of writing home is pretty antiquated...but I digress. Anyway, the pineapple was ample and the cheese was generous as well. However, there could've been a little more meat.  The panini comes with one side and I ordered the mac salad. It was pretty small and very underwhelming. Small as it was, I didn't even bother finishing it.  I would give the panini four stars and the mac salad only two, for an average of three. Seems like a better spot for lunch than dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the first time and had a blast here...server was awesome and had plenty of info on the night life here! Food was typical bar and pub style but good nonetheless. But great people with a nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Me, Ben & James stopped in on Friday during the Coca Cola 600 weekend. They shut down all of Uptown to celebrate those left hand turns over at Charlotte Motor Speedway.  We were looking for a place to sit outside and enjoy the weather but every place was full. The last place we tried was here and we decided to go inside and wait for an outside table.  We were served by Aaron from Lenoir, an Air Force Veteran who has worked there for several years. A friendly fellow though he admitted his allegiance to the Redskins.  He noticed my hat and being Memorial Weekend, invited me to sign their Veteran wall.  We decided to forget about the outside table and talked Panther and Redskin football with Aaron instead."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, but the pretzel bites are outstanding. I like coming here when all the other Epicenter locations are too crowded, or listen to their live music (always an acoustic jammy feel). Overall it has a great \"off the path\" pub feel while still being at the heart of uptown Charlotte. Come early if you want a seat for Happy hour!"}
