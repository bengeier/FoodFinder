{"text":"Rod and Elizabeth maybe run the most under rated mom and pop shop in Calgary, whether you're ordering take out or eating in, the food is always delicious and the prices always reasonable. Best part is the service. Elizabeth is always great to our young sons and greets them both with a hug. After the hug she makes sure they get crispy fries with plenty of ketchup, before the rest of the meal is served, so that two young boys arent kept waiting for food.Our boys love this place, as do we. Do yourself a favor and take the family."}
{"text":"I am only rating this a 5 based on the pizza served at Vina Pizza. I have not tried any other items on the menu.... But the pizza ...... OH the pizza is amazing!! It is made in the same vein as the Greek- owned pizza places in Calgary.... But I don't know if the owners are Greek or not.  I am not comparing it to Punchinella types of pizza this is good old pepperoni, hawaiian, house special kind of place. The crust is perfection, the toppings ample and the cheese golden. And what makes this place really good is the PRICE of the pizza. You could go a few blocks up the road to Nicks on Crowchild, and pay a significant amount more for a substandard pizza. Vina is a small cozy little place, clean and unpretentious. Make a reservation if you want to dine in. The place is always packed at dinner time."}
{"text":"Vina pizza is some of the best I've ever had and they deliver! The crust was crisp, thick (but not too thick) and delicious and the tomato sauce tastes homemade. The pizza is always cooked to perfection and arrives steaming hot. I sometimes opt to pick up the pizza myself just because the owners are so friendly."}
{"text":"We just flew into Calgary and stumbled on this restaurant.  Not knowing what to expect, we decided to take a chance.  Wow, was this worth the risk.  We were treated warmly and the food was great.  I had the chicken souvlaki and it was cooked to perfection with a great tzatziki  on the side.  My wife loved the Alfredo and my daughter, a notoriously picky eater, wolfed down the spaghetti in pomodoro sauce.  The service was great and the people were very friendly.  This place was quite the find and worth a return."}
{"text":"This is a nice local family owned restaurant. 
The food is solid and they make a great pizza. 
Friendly atmosphere and staff. 
I recommend this place if you like a good thick crust pizza as well saucy pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Expectations were high based on other reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. Vina lived up to my hopes. The Pizza (we had the Sicilian) was excellent. The large slice of tomato atop the pizza were perfect. It is easy to kill the tomato by overcooking it. Not here they were just right. The same is true of the green pepper cooked right, still firm and right with taste and texture. The onions were rich and full of flavour without over powering the other toppings. The cheese just the right thickness keeping all the toppings together and providing a great mix.

Like the toppings the pizza itself was excellent. It provided such a great platform for all the tastes. It was light yet firm without being chewy or doughy. The crust was as it should be - more firm but not tough and definitely not dry. It was moist and just a bit fluffy.

The prices were great and the service was very quick and cheerful. It was clean and bright and well worth the trip even if you are a pizza connoisseur. 

Even with the addition of a couple of beers the price was still right. (FYI They had Kilkeny though it was not on the menu so be sure to ask)"}
{"text":"You know what? I have changed my mind about this place. I think it's a treat to have this in my neighbourhood, and you really can't beat the cozy, homey feeling of this family run business. This place is always busy, and that is a sign that there is something about this place that just keeps the folks coming back. The staff are super friendly, frequently asking how things are without being annoying. I think Jill W. hit the nail on the head when she said it was \"unpretentious\". 

I had baked spaghetti, and it was just what I was craving. Classic comfort food, accompanied by fluffy garlic toast. The food is what it is, but I kind of like that about this place. It's not trying to pretend it's something that it's not, and they are choosing to make classic pizza and pasta, and doing it well. When I was there, most people were eating pizza - and I stand by what I said in my previous review about the toppings - BUT I don't know that I think that is such a problem anymore, this place seems to be able to make it work.

Oh, I'll be back. Can't wait to come in here on a cold winter day and tuck into some piping hot eats."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it's a great place to go. friendly, clean, quiet, and great prices!
Definitely check it out sometime !"}
{"text":"Vina is one of the best pizza places in Calgary. I was so sad to hear that they have sold their business and will be closing this month!"}
{"text":"You are made to feel like royalty when you walk in the door. Wonderful personalized and attentive service
The baked penne was a generous portion with a nice crust on top the penne was al dente but I found the sauce a bit thin. I enjoyed my meal but nothing special. However, the pizzas looked great
Garlic toast needed some more garlic"}
{"text":"Came based on consistent reviews on yelp and US. 

Ordered a Caesar salad and a Greek pizza. 

Salad was made with very fresh lettuce. The dressing was great, creamy, full of garlic with a slight citrus finish. Croutons - from a box. Booooo! Salad was good never the less. 

Pizza was awesome. Nice thick crust. Very crispsy. Not greasy. Sauce is homemade. LOTS of garlic. The pizza was well cooked, the cheese on the top was crisped in a way I've never seen before. Finished with fresh tomatoes.

Four stars! I'd be back."}
{"text":"Husband and I were craving a good baked lasagna.  We went on Yelp and chose this place based on it's reviews.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back.  Nice, friendly atmosphere and thank god not a chain!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We've been going for years and we have never had a bad meal. Pizza is fantastic, the fries are the best in the Calgary and  so is the garden salad I always get to assuage my guilt over the fries. Try the burger as well - so good! Wherever you live in Calgary, it's worth the trek to get there and it's in trendy West Hillhurst - what could be better than that?"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best pizza/pasta places in Kensington.  Don't be alarmed by the relative shady looking exterior, or the very diner-esque interior.  The food here is fantastic.  I have enjoyed both the pizza and pasta here and fell in love with their lasagna.  It's seriously amongst the best lasagna I've ever had (sorry mom).

Vina has apparently been around for a long time.  I discovered it only because a friend who lives and work nearby swears by it.  Naturally, when watching a hockey game, he would order from Vina whenever we needed pizza.  I started ordering from them whenever I hung out with him.  Hurts the wallet, but makes the stomach feel good!

Vina is not expensive though, unless you order from them often (which I had started to do).  They also offer discounts when you pay certain ways and if you pick up instead of getting delivery.  Cash will obviously get you the biggest discount.  I would say I've probably eaten their food about 50 times, and it was always prepared perfectly.

The people who work there are also great.  They have always been courteous and they have built quite the clientele of regulars as a result.  I've never eaten in, but I've often seen the same people during my regular pick-ups.  They also have a good following of Calgary's finest, so if you have any warrants out for your arrest, I would choose another establishment!"}
{"text":"We just moved here around the corner. Came here on a friends recommendation. Everything she said was spot on. Great food and ambiance. It's like your neighborhood family gathering place. Had the NY steak, with perfect peppery season and seasonal veg. Friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was teetering between giving Vina 3 or 4 stars, so consider this rating a 3.5.

The pizza is good, only problem is, just a little on the pricey side. Not terrible, but for what it is, it could be cheaper.
Nice crispy crust while still \"fluffy\" pizza.

There are, however, two problems with the pizza that are very common to the Canadian pizza industry in general:
Pepbologna & Bolami.
You know what I'm talking about. The disappointing processed product that seems to be common in so many pizza places. 
When you order \"pepperoni\" or \"salami,\" it is actually neither of those that come on your pie, but rather, a uniform, tasteless, \"bologna-like\" product. So disappointing.

Decor is ... hmm ... interesting. Feels like a classic small-town restaurant.

Service was really good. Very friendly.

All in all, a pretty good pizza joint, I'm just not sure how soon I would think of them when craving pizza."}
