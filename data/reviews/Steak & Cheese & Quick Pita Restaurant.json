{"text":"The falafel wrap I ordered was actually so bad (dry, cheap ingredients), that I couldn't even finish it.   The first meal I've ever ordered in Toronto that deserved spitting out."}
{"text":"Loved their chicken shawarma! It had taste---like tandoori chicken like someone mentioned earlier! If you don't like the lettuce, you can tell them to reduce it and they give more chicken."}
{"text":"This space was empty when I dropped by to get a late afternoon snack around 4:30pm but quickly got busier as I finished up my meal.  I thought this place was OK. I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich, which came out hot and fresh. There were flavorful pieces of what appeared to be tandoori-spiced chicken which combined well with the hot sauce, tomato, and onion. Lettuce could've been a bit fresher, but still not a bad deal for $5 + tax.  I think I still prefer the pita that's crisp and freshly toasted before serving at Anoush on Simcoe and Dundas, but this place can easily deliver if in a bind."}
{"text":"The people working at this place are really nice but the food after 6pm is just awful! Everything is old and I think they are just selling week old leftovers at night!"}
{"text":"UofT staple, price is ok, food is meh. Service is a hit or miss. If you're not working on a final just go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced for the quality of food. I ordered a shawarma plate and the shawarma was too dry and didn't taste fresh. The salad included was too small that it felt like I had next to none, and it did not taste fresh either. Customer service is slow and should be more efficient. I was not satisfied for spending $10 (including tax) for it."}
{"text":"Really cheap food near U of T and one of my to-go lunch places. I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN BRIYANI AND CHICKEN SHAWRMA AND BUTTER CHICKEN!! I haven't really gotten anything else, I think I got their plates once upon a time, but their chicken briyani is definitely more filling than their chicken shawrma plate. The only thing drawback here is that if you use debit, they'll charge you more and the owners will most likely NOT tell you. So be sure to ask right before you pay. Also, they might have questionable kitchen standards it's really delicious food for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Extreme budget student food. I tried their steak and cheese, their shawarmas, and their biryanis. I didn't really like any of them.  I think the only reason the place runs is because how cheap it is. You can often get a decent meal for $5 or less. That is amazing for a student.   However, I rather opt for pizza, subway or the pay a bit more and get The SAJ wrap from next door."}
{"text":"This is not meant to be a 5* experience. this is some decent food, HUGE variety, and great pricing. You can get a plate of biryani for 1.5x the price of a starbucks coffee. think about that"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch in between classes. Got a chicken shawarma wrap. Service is really quick.  Nicely stuffed. Garlic sauce and hummus are both good. Chicken is well cooked, for the most part, but a little inconsistent. Very decent price, $5 plus tax, especially for all of us students.  Owners look like cool people."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and had a gyro pita. It was passable, but much to small to make a decent lunch for me. After the reviews on here, I was skeptical, but I thought I would give it another try.  I decided to head back today for the falafel special. The falafel was delicious! I'm no expert, but all I know is that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Came for a steak and cheese sub for $6.5. Was smaller than expected with mushrooms and onions and very salty, but decent for the price. Quick service, waited around 5 minutes, and the place was completely empty. I'd only be returning out of convenience though."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place doesn't deserve me spending time writing a review about it... just DON'T GO THERE and hopefully something better will appear there soon. Man I feel like an ass, I apologize to the owners who are very nice people but COME ON, serve some proper food!!  Everything tastes bad, but it's super cheap especially on their daily specials (usually prices $3-4). I've never had such bland, tasteless food in my life."}
{"text":"had the gyro across the street from uoft. I placed my order and somehow this Caucasian girl who ordered a gyro after me got her order before mines when the store owner can clearly see that I was waiting a lot earlier than she was.   Ive never had a gyro before so take this review with a grain of salt. The meal didnt look anything like it did on the google images and the meat was very salty and had the consistency of rubber. So I guess you can say i was eating salty rubber.  The rice wasnt good quality, neither was the salad. I couldnt finish this meal even though I was hungry when I came.   I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Considering your options in the area, it's not that bad. My shawarma sandwich was pretty good and fairly priced. The Philly cheese steak sandwich was all right too, maybe not quite as good as my shawarma.  This isn't the kind of place you go to for any sort of dining experience. It's fast food, and as far as fast food goes, it's OK."}
{"text":"I stopped by here quickly looking for some butter chicken that wasn't $13+, which almost seems to be the norm these days. I was happy to see that theirs was only $6.99. I soon found out why. The order came with only six tiny pieces of chicken. The taste was quite good, the sauce being a bit lighter in colour than what I'm used to, but decently spiced. The snack-sized order though was just not large enough to constitute a meal or relieve my hunger."}
{"text":"Positive: very tasty and home made food (I tried sheesh kabab plater - thus, no idea about their wraps or shawarmas), which is thus different than the good but Americanized and standardized Ali baba food. Staff is nice!  Negative: store and seatings do not look very appealing... price for a combo platers are relatively high for a fast food place."}
{"text":"I am sorry, I tried. At least three times.  It's been awhile since I've been here, so I don't want to condemn them without a retrial, but I was left deeply dissatisfied with what I got every single time, back when they moved into this area. As I mentioned with Queenslice, I find their lack of focus represented in the signage- \"Toronto's #1 shawarma house!\"/\"the original philly style sandwich!\"/\"juice bar!\" to be indicative of greater problems in the kitchen. But, it has managed to stick around for probably close to two years, so you never know.  All I know:  -the falafel balls were dry, bordering on stale, -the shawarma was gristly, with too many of those *hard* chunks that never fail to disturb me, -i was charged extra for tabouli and pickles...I think the only included toppings were the straight, base veggies of everyplace (tomatoes, lettuce, onion). This was probably what bothered me the most. Not cool, guys."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try. The gyros were horrible the first time so I tried the falafels this time. Big mistake. Bland and stale seem to be the main ingredients for this place. It also took more than 10 minutes for them to make it too. I thought it was a fast food type place, not a sit-down type place judging by the name but I guess I was wrong. It's a shame because the owner seems quite nice. I just can't bring myself to give this place more than 1 star because the food is just so bad."}
{"text":"I FREAKING LOVE THE CHEESE & STEAK 8-INCH SUB!! AND IT'S 5.99 ONLY AFTER TAX!  I rarely eat out, but the cheese & steak sub is definitely the best food in downtown. They are very generous with the meat portion and the meat is tasty as hell. Could've done with more cheese tho. Nevertheless, this a great go-to place when you're hungry. I wish I'm still hungry so that I can eat 2nd offering :("}
{"text":"This place is amazing for steak and cheese. Go there every time I want a sub, never disappointed.   Though I've never tried their other things."}
