{"text":"Food Heaven! Don't miss out
This place works as a grocery store and a cafe.. And believe me when I say the have amazing food here..
The Mana'eesh are amazing, so is the Shawarma! I don't think you can go wrong here.
I had the Shawarma it was out of this world good.. The pita alone is so fresh, so tender.. Just delicious.
Also the prices here are pretty good"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"Pitaland serves my favorite hummus and Lebanese food! I especially love their roasted red pepper and walnut spread. I also love their dried lentils and grains that you can buy in bulk."}
{"text":"Had their grape leaves and gyro at the farmers market yesterday and it was soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal I love Pitaland I always have when I was a kid on the way home from school id buy a bag of small pitas for .99 cents and walks down The BLVD eating fresh plain pita. As I got older I started to indulge more into Lebanese and similar kinds of food. Pitaland's hummus is great along with the tabouli and olives and anything else you buy there. The best thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die for that you can't get just anywhere! Gyros and the Chicken Shawarma are my favorites if you have been to Pitaland you know how great it is and if you haven't been to Pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life. Pitaland is excellent all around from products to staff to cleanliness I can't say a bad thing about Pitaland it's a neighborhood staple and hope I never see it leave. So I hope if you haven't gone yet you go now because you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love it!  The new cafe is beautiful and the food great.  Traditional gyros still great plus good selection of new sandwiches/dishes.  And as always, great hummus and greek and lebanese salads.  
Also, definitely THE place to shop for mediterranean cooking ingredients."}
{"text":"Descubrí Pitaland casualmente y recomiendo encarecidamente visitarlo y probar sus productos. Todo en la tienda está muy bien organizado y limpio. Tiene buenos precios y su comida es riquísima. Los dulces son un auténtico placer. El personal muy amable y te hacen muy cómoda la visita."}
{"text":"Was there today--after the recommendation of many locals, took a relative to check it out. Great selection of fresh food in the market and amazing cafe food that came quickly. Pastries are also wonderful. They really need another location in the city so I can visit weekly!!"}
{"text":"Pitaland is the best run business in Brookline (with las palmas a close second).  The café is well staffed and the food is delicious.  I love the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch.  In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the Boulevard, Pitaland is a savior for us locals.  Support them with your business!"}
{"text":"Best gyros and shawarma in Pittsburgh!
Greg and his staff know how to cook. Lebanese house salad is awsome. The best in Brookline and the best gyro EVER! Keep up the good work. The specials may make you eat way more than anticipated..."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Brookline this is the place to go.  

Good place to grab a sandwich and fries.  Everything is very fresh!  

Spinach pies are to die for.  The pepperoni rolls are amazing and the price is rite.  

The staff is pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Pita Land, olive you.

I don't know why I don't come here everyday.

It's a great little market, where you can get delicious Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh made hummus, dips, pita bread,  you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) 

Best of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn delicious and cheap to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french fries with rosemary dip, flat breads are all excellent and won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Finally we found a great Mediterranean breakfast with Lebanese hospitality. The price was so cheap and great taste. We always come her for grocery shopping and lunch food. Yummy"}
{"text":"New pita café is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming"}
{"text":"Absofrigginamazeballs!  This place is the bomb!  Great food, friendly service and a little grocery in the side. Who could ask for more!?!  The falafel pita will astound. Yummers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their bread!!! Delicious, soft pitas made fresh in store, plus many other kinds of middle eastern flatbreads. I bought delicious Lebanese olive oil here, tasty baklava, lots of cheap legumes. Definitely a place that made me wish I had lived in Brookline!

I almost forgot about their spinach pies and cheese pies... soooooo good."}
{"text":"This is a real 5 star review from someone not affiliated with Pitaland. I've been going to this place since it was next door to Party Cake Shop and called Chahines. Good luck finding better pita bread or spinach pies. I live out of state now, but when I go home, I load up on the spinach pies. Seriously, it's worth a drive from across town. And the hummus which I am eating now is likely the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Such a great grocery store and restaurant to have in Pittsburgh. I love to get gyros from the Cafe. It's great to be able to buy hummus and pita bread when you're craving it and have it for lunch at work. They sell foods you can't find at Giant Eagle and everything is authentic."}
{"text":"Best pitas at the best prices, hands down. We keep a bunch in the freezer at all times; pull a few out and make pita pizzas. We've used them with dozens of different topping combinations. Friendly, helpful staff. Homemade, fresh prepared foods. Pitaland is always a great, healthy choice. We love it!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Everything I've had from their cafe menu has been fantastic. I just finished scarfing down the Lebanese House Salad with Gyro meat added, and it was so delicious that I felt compelled to finally leave a review. The salad is so fresh and packed to the brim with toppings and meat, plus it came with ample pita pieces. Well worth the price. Of course, I also scooped up a couple pieces of Baklava - their's is the best I've ever had. On top of the delicious food, the service is always so friendly. I also love perusing amongst the grocery items while I wait for my food. My only complaint, and it's really not that big of a deal, is that I wish they were open a little bit later. However, I understand the desire to close up and get some work/life balance. This place is not only a Brookline gem, but a Pittsburgh gem. Make the trip! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken and lamb gyros in Pittsburgh. Both are cut fresh of a spit, the taste is wonderful and is super fresh. The lamb burger is great as well, if your in the the area this place is a must try."}
{"text":"CAME FOR TACOS DOWN THE STREET BUT I WAS COMPELLED TO THE FALAFEL!

It was soooo hot this weekend! I biked with \"Newspaper Photographer\" and was looking for a tasty eat that wouldn't be heavy on my stomach. We drove up looking for tacos but than I saw the sign for Pitaland! I've bought their pitas in local grocery stores before and I'm a fan. And I gravitate to day to day eating in the vegetarian realm (to keep looking HOT course!) so I was pulled to this place! 

Lucky surprise they have a lunch counter and a great menu. I have the falafel plate and it was perfect and guilt free! Filled with fresh veggies, pita and pickles! Just what I wanted.

If I am ever back in that neck of the woods I will definitely return!

Muah! Love You!"}
{"text":"An awesome place to stop for lunch, dinner or even a quick grocery trip. After we moved to Brookline I stopped in to see what this place was all about. It smelled delicious and I could not  wait to come back for dinner. If you need any fresh produce or bread they have it all. We  finally went back for dinner this past week and I ordered the small size falafel wrap and my boyfriend got the dinner sized gyro (huge portions). The workers could not have been nicer and helped us with the menu items.  We also got hummus and pita (not on menu)-they gave us a full container of the roasted red pepper hummus with pita which was very delicious. My falafel wrap, even though the smaller order,  was huge and plenty for dinner.  Came filled with lots of fresh veggies including some pickled veggies. I asked for the tzatziki sauce which was yummy and I highly recommend.  Save room for dessert as they have many cookies and baklava. Forgot one of the best parts, the prices are very reasonable and they have a small seating area inside."}
{"text":"I tried both the beef shawarma and the falafel sandwiches at this place. It's both a food counter and a middle eastern style deli/grocery. The service at the food counter was slow and impersonal, but about what you'd expect from such a place I guess. 

I wasn't super impressed with the shawarma. The beef was tough and it felt more like a gyro with tahini sauce instead of tzatziki sauce.

I enjoyed the falafel sandwich much more. The falafel is freshly fried and while not the best texture was very flavorful with a nice crunch. The pickles on it were actually pretty good even though I'm not a pickle fan... Definitely house made and not soggy. The other veggies as a lot of flavor, although the overall veggie to falafel ratio is a bit off. Still a very tasty sandwich, though."}
{"text":"Great gyros and produce. The boulevard has definitely changed in the past couple years, but Pitaland has stayed the same. The gyro's are always fresh and they have a vast assortment of produce. If you're in the area definitely stop here, as Brookline is on the rise!"}
{"text":"Awesome gem in Brookline. If you like Lebanese food, this is a great market to swing by for fresh (still warm!) pitas, and maybe grab a spinach & feta pie to heat up later for an easy dinner.  The baba ganouj and hummus are fabulous. 

Pitaland stocks authentic ingredients at reasonable prices. I've also heard good things about using Pitaland for catering events such as grad parties, etc."}
{"text":"Oh ma goodness! The falafel pita sandwich is ah-maz-ing. I won't be able to resist coming back. Staff is very pleasant and friendly as well. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Pitaland has my heart. Upon entering the first time, I walked over to the viewing window to admire the pillows of pita going by on the conveyor belt. Seconds later I am invited in, given a hot pita, and practically a mini tour with invitation to bring my kids next time. This family business is amazing. This is a gem in this city. 

The food is simply addicting. Fresh, flavorful, and all at very reasonable prices. We always get a bag or two of pitas, spinach feta pies, stuffed grape leaves, tabbouleh, cucumber yogurt, and more. One of our greatest discoveries is that you can get sliced gyro meat in their freezer case! 

The cafe inside is probably one of the best kept secrets around. The falafel plate is a steal and they make our favorite falafel in Pittsburgh. 

Trips to Pitaland are pretty much a weekly thing since that first visit. You will not be sorry for stopping in! What should you try? One of everything!

Editing to add that they have the best French fries!!"}
{"text":"I never been to your place but Every Tuesday after 3pm your table is set up w delicious goodies. Id like to order things the lady said call you in am on tuesday and I can get them at farmers market. I haven't had any of these since my Sitoo died. She made best stuffed grape leaves she grew in her garden& Fatoosh! I woll call next Tuesday am and hope I can get foods Sitoo made,"}
{"text":"We've always been fans of Pita Land as a great Mediterranean grocery and the best joint in Pittsburgh to get freshly made pitas of all varieties and hummus.  When we heard they were putting in a cafe, I knew it would be good.

Gyros, baked flat breads, pizzas, burgers, and all kinds of Mediterranean fare do not disappoint.  Much to our own demise (wayyy too much to eat), we ordered a meat flat bread (thinking it would be small), a Gyro Doner (larger than normal), and a Lamb Burger.

The Lamb Burger, hands down, is one of the best burgers I've actually had in Pittsburgh.  Super juicy.  Cooked to order.  Feta cheese, pickled onions, etc.  I highly recommend.

Do yourself a favor and get a piece of baklava from the counter on your way out as well!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love the baklava, gyro and chicken shawarma. My boyfriend likes their pepperoni roll but I haven't tried it myself."}
{"text":"much nicer inside after they renovated this former Foodland space ...
the cafe is interesting but the food is crazy expensive for what you end up with, in my opinion...the beef schwarma is tasty as is their hummus / kibbee balls / etc.
i usually end up getting tacos at Las Palmas, a few doors up since it's a much better bargain but fans of middle eastern food ought to check this joint out ."}
{"text":"Way to go Brookline! This area is turning into a pretty good lunch destination, with some great ethnic food being represented. I have shopped at Pitaland for olives and sundries in the past, but today was the first time I had lunch at the café. Not only is this a great retail store to buy Middle Eastern items you might not be able to find elsewhere, the prepared food is delicious. 

The menu features lots of Middle Eastern staples, such as falafel, hummus,  babghanouj and the other items that make up traditional mezze. A lamb burger and sandwiches made with their pita bread are also offered, as well as salads and platters. I had the falafel platter, which was wonderful. Their falafel is the best I've had anywhere, and I eat a lot of this stuff. The accompaniments on the plate were fresh and pickled vegetables with a side of tahini and their pita bread. All great. My husband offered to share his fries with me, as they give you a huge portion, and my hand kept sneaking over to his basket for more. These are perfectly fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika...I'm not sure, but it was really nice. When I checked out with my olives and groceries, the guy behind the counter gave me a yummy fig on the house. He also sang as he rang up my order, and thanked me for coming in. The guy who took our order at the café also came over to ask us how everything was while we were eating. This would be de rigueur at a full service place, but was notable at a place with counter service. Really nice people and excellent food. I may have to give breakfast a try soon."}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast here this morning.  The breakfast table, foul, and pastries were all amazing.  Very friendly staff.  Picked up some olives, feta, and pita to go.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"The cashier looks a lot like Enrique Iglesias, I almost asked if he would sing for us. No but seriously, thank you Yelpers for helping me find this great bakery and restaurant. I'm new to Lebanese food, haven't had much exposure yet, but we tried and we loved! Had the Beef Shwarma, was delicious. My only regret is not ordering the full plate, will definitely be stopping here regularly."}
{"text":"Their hummus is so good!!! Not expensive and very fresh! Also have very fresh produce and very good gyros"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, the food was excellent! We also got hummus, pita and tabuli to go. The staff were really friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Middle-Eastern food around.  I have tried most of the menu, my fav always been fattoush with chicken however, I tried the breakfast today and OMG the Shanklish : with eggs was awesome!!! Loved it!!!! Great job to Greg and his team at the café ! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Very awesome place. Lamb burger was amazing. Schwarma was so-so. Look forward to trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place to grab Mediterranean food. They have a grill running just about all day which you can order off the menu right then & there, items that are freshly made-to-order however way you like it (just be sure to specify prefs when placing your order). This place also doubles as an essential supermarket that sells just about anything you'd look for. Would highly recommend the pita bread, gyros, falafel (very good), though honestly just about anything is pretty good & fair game. Prices are extremely reasonable & this place looks a whole lot better after the remodel. A pretty gem of a place in the Brookline neighborhood ... props to such an establishment."}
{"text":"Good pitas and good people. They gave my son a fresh warm pita from the conveyor and gave us a tour. 

I had a falafel sandwich. The falafel was very good but, as someone stated previously, the falafel to veggie ratio is a bit off. Still tasty but not the best I ever had."}
{"text":"If you live in Brookline, look no further, this is your one stop shop for Mediterranean/Middle Eastern quisine. You can eat in or take home some groceries. Iv had their falafel gyro and regular gyro. The falafel one was very good with a healthy dose of both falafel and fresh veggies. The regular gyro fell short of my expectations however, the lamb being mushy and slightly gritty. I plan on trying more items on their menu and possibly grab some groceries, but if you just want a good ol gyro, Sams Sun Sandwich in Carrick or Original Gyro on 88 are better options"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed.  I was recently in need of some tahini and in the past I knew that there was just about one place to get it in the city.  Now, I know differently.  

This place is constantly busy, the employees are swarming about like worker bees.  They never seem to slow down for one second.  While I was browsing the shelves for what I needed I could tell the employees were watching me to see if I found what I needed.  Like a sixth sense and employee smoothly asked and pointed me in the right direction.

If it wasn't for that, the smells would keep me coming back over and over again.  It was a garlic heavy smell.  One that makes you feel warm and think about all the delicious food you have eaten in the past with the help of garlic.  

There is a small seating area if you want to eat what you have bought, and it looks as though they have outdoor seating for the warmer months."}
{"text":"I been here few times and tried different things. Food is okey. One of the guys that works there suggested the beef shawarma but it wasn't as I expected, the beef was chewy. Chicken shawarma was good, but you have to buy a side it doesn't come with fries or anything. Falafel are ok, a little dry. The lemonade that they make is 85% water you can barely taste the lemon. Some of the things like the feta spinach of meat pies I find a little pricey, $4 and it's as big as the palm of the hand. The place is fairly clean. I like the baklava and pastries there. I also tried the stuffed grape leaves which I liked. I absolutely love the bread here, always fresh."}
{"text":"This place was such a revelation! They had me with the sheer variety of options, both in their grocery store and on the cafe menu! I ordered way more than I could eat.. and most dishes were pretty good. They have lots of vegetarian options. I'd recommend the Halloumi, the stuffed grape leaves and the Muhammara dip. I liked my falafal wrap, but I have to admit it wasn't the best I've eaten. The crispy cauliflower although flavorful was soggy and resting in a puddle of oil. The biggest disappointment though was the cold hard pita. I've heard SO much about this place and couldn't wait to try this apparently amazing and fresh pita that seems to be the USP of Pitaland, but it wasn't to be this time. I'll go back though one more time and try again. The service was ok. Don't miss the Arabic coffee when you're there.. oh and their dips are all pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I needed some supples for the holidays.  We have been here a few times but it is always an experience.  Yesterday they had live music and the bread was being made when we walked in. They brought fresh bread to the kids.  The staff was very helpful.  We got a gyro and a Lebanese pita pizza for a snack. Both were outstanding.  When we got home I opened the hummus which is always the next.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't been into the store since the remodel. It is beautiful. The pitas are world class, all of the store made food is excellent
The hummus, the desserts all of it is outstanding!
Now! They have a small walk up cafe serving all sorts of mid-east food. They even have breakfast.
If you haven't been there in a while, go back, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic Lebanese food. Delish beef schwarma and falafel pitas. Every ingredient was fresh. Quite a bargain at $5 a pop!"}
{"text":"We decided to take a ride back to our old neighborhood. Pitaland was a stop we had to make, it's been so long since we've had delicious freshly made pitas. We also tried the homemade Baklava.... Wow!!!!! It's worth the 30 minute drive alone. Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The hummus is great, the people are great. The lamb pies are absolutely incredible. This place will teach you anything you want to know about middle eastern food! A good friend of mine is Egyptian and moved here a few years ago and this place is the closest he said he's come to home. Have to respect that!"}
{"text":"I love that this market is in walking distance to my house and has all the middle eastern spices that I need. But on top of that their lamb burgers are AMAZING. I'm here all the time getting one for lunch or dinner. I may start having the lamb burger for bother lunch and dinner haha."}
{"text":"Pitaland is unbelievable. The cafe serves a great Turkish coffee, and the beef shawarma can't be beat. The grocery store has a good selection of produce, dry and frozen goods, and prepared foods (hummus, taboulleh, kibbee, baba ghanoush, etc.) You won't go home hungry!"}
{"text":"They make their own Pita breads here, and they make them delicious and cheap. This would be enough reason to go here, as it's hard to find tasty and fresh pitas (most of the time, the bags still have steam in them because they're so fresh) for a good price, and this is it.

On top of that, they have frozen raw gyros meat and home made tzatsiki sauce, so you can throw together a gyros sandwich. They have hummus and different kinds of olives by the pound, and a huge selection of turkish and arab foods. Some of their more interesting specialty items do get pricier, but mostly the cost is reasonable, and you can at least understand why a little box of food bought in sub-bulk from a random country in the Middle East is more expensive. 

Diverse, well stocked non-perishables and cheap, delicious pitas and prepared food accompaniments."}
{"text":"Love Pitaland!  I have shopped there for years.....the remodel is beautiful.  Such a friendly staff. The pita bread is always so fresh.  The last time I was there I tried the Muhammara, it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Gem! 

I sent my husband here to pick up a to-go order once we were done at the car dealer on 51. He said the place was cute and had a bunch of middle eastern groceries/olives/etc. I won't  review on the actual place since I wasn't actually in there, but the food! The food was inexpensive and surpassed my expectations. 

5 stars because nothing we had was less than awesome. The pita (10 pack for $2.50) was warm, soft, and chewy. The chicken schwarma was tasty, the gyro was huge and flavorful, the baba was Smokey, lemony, and creamy, and the hummus! Ugh delicious! 

Will most definitely be back for the delicious guilt free food and the bargain prices!"}
{"text":"I left a few reviews for lunch menu's in this area because my coworkers and I like to try new and local comestibles once in a while.

First thing, they need to change the font on their menu. We could barely read it! 
One of us ordered two Kibbee Footballs and didn't know that they only got one in one order. That was the only bother with this order.
We had their Falafel sandwich, Baba Ghannouj, Beef Shawarma sandwich, Stuffed grape-leaves, Muhammara; everything was delicious. 

They also had Baklava to sample at the register and all I can say is that I've ever taste Baklava this fresh!

Not to mention the store itself; I haven't seen it in years and they have since fixed it up and added a Café. What a pleasing ambience!"}
{"text":"My chicken gyro had a little bit too much of a smoky flavor, but the lamb gyro I tried was excellent - the pita itself is heaven - they make them here (hence \"Pitaland\"!) And I must say the Rosemary Fries with Lemon Aioli dipping sauce are a welcome treat! I will definitely be back!!! Next time I plan on trying the Lamb Burger!"}
{"text":"Score ethnic food! I will say that I love their hummus. It's very tasty as well as their pitas (which appear to be sold all over the city). The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"My new go to place for hummus, pita, and all sorts of Lebanese food. The Cafe is new and I'm dying to try some of the delicious offerings. Wide selection of dried legumes, olive station, pastas, grains, and pantry staples at a decent price. Huge variety of Greek olive oils too."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.

For my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with \"pita\" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.

The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While my chicken shwarma ended up being somewhat of a disappointment to me I think that this place has potential and I would like to give it another try."}
{"text":"I came here as this was the First (and best!) Stop in the Pittsburgh Food Tour that I had booked. Y'all it's a Mecca (pun intended) and if you are a Pittsburgh local and a foodie, you absolutely owe it to yourself to come and check this magical store in person.

I think what surprised me most about the space was how efficient it was and also it was full of unexpected surprises. Behind that unassuming facade is an actual Pita bakery, a butchers, an industrial kitchen space and a grocery store. I was privileged to be given a look behind the scenes, thanks to the tour otherwise I reckon most folks walking in would only see the store + butchers and a glimpse of the fresh in-house Pita making, behind the glass windows.

There was tons of Middle Eastern grocery stuff, mostly focused on Lebanese brands as that where the owner is originally from but there was so much other grocery stuff on the shelves that I didn't recognize. 

Also, the sheer variety of olives was amazing - There was one from Greek that actually tasted sweet!! We sampled lovely freshly made hummus and feta which tasted gorgeous- the only thing they didn't have was camel-milk chocolate, but who knows that might be coming soon.

Absolutely recommend coming here - it's a feast for the senses!!

Yelp Review 40/2017"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. They have lunch, breakfast, dinner, groceries, deserts. I don't know where to begin. 

They are always super friendly. Their Lebanese breakfast dish, Foul (f?l) is to die for, my mouth was watering as they were simmering the chickpeas and fava beans in garlic and lemon. 

For lunch, I've had their falafel - amazing. They have a garlic sauce called Toom that I literally put on everything, it's strong and spicy. 

Their baklava and desert items are fresh and delicious. They also have an olive bar, and you can watch the fresh pita being made through a giant window to the kitchen areas.  

They have a lot of Middle Eastern grocery items that you can't find any where else in the area. And as I said, they are so friendly and welcoming, they make me want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"We live in NJ and every time we visit our daughter we always have to stop at pita land! Fresh pita, feta, etc.  We take as much home as we can!"}
{"text":"This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  My wife ordered a falafel plate.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I felt the same about my Gyro.  The fries were great.  They're seasoned with something I couldn't identify and served with tartar.  Awesome.  I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  Miriam helped me out and I did finish them.  They were too good to waste.  I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best I have ever had anywhere.  This place is a treasure.  If I lived near here, I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Whether you are buying groceries or buying fresh cooked meals, this is the best Lebanese food in the Burgh. They make their pitas on site and you can see them being made. They have an olive bar that has a great selection of olives. They have fresh hummus, yogurt, babaganoush, and stuffed grape leaves. I love their gyros and the chicken shawarma.  For \"sauce\" on the shawarma they take pure garlic and whip it until it becomes a paste. It is SO good but leaves a slow burn. You can get Tahini sauce to cut the burn. 
Everything's fresh and delicious. Love!! Love!! Love!!"}
{"text":"I adore this place.  Everything here is good including the service.  I've eaten there and have used their catering service.  Both were fabulous."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Pitaland! I love this place everyone is friendly who works here and very knowledgeable about products. They even offer tips on any dishes or how to prepare something. The bakery department is wonderful I love love LOVE there pistachio baklava!! To me personally I think it deserves a award because it's the best in Pittsburgh area hands down! They even have a small little olive bar area where you can take some home. They have tons of dry food and cold/frozen food as well. I always recommend this place to people looking for that hidden gem!"}
{"text":"What an absolute gem to find in Brookline. Had a bit of time to grab lunch in Brookline today. This particular neighborhood is one I don't get to much, so since business brought me here I figured I'd come early and grab breakfast/lunch. Not many choices for breakfast along Brookline Blvd. made PitaLand the easy choice. Once I walked through the door I was shocked to see a stocked market, bakery, and industrial pita machine in the back! PitaLand has classic Mediterranean dishes including Falafel, gyro, shawarma, and lamb. It's so rare that I see shawarma, I had to order the chicken version. Well seasoned, just crispy enough, cool pickles, lettuce, onion, and dressing. Perfect amount of food, done well. I had to hold back ordering another. $8.56 with a soda is one heck of a deal for quality food like this. I will be back."}
{"text":"We rode down Brookline Boulevard today and discovered that a street food war is apparently underway; Pitaland is now selling hot food outside, 2 doors down from Las Palmas Carniceria's taco tand. I saw a vertical spit with what appeared to be shawarma (?) on it. The Boulevard is becoming all the more curious..."}
{"text":"Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  

The pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.  

Good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.

They also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. 

I brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.

They also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food around. Both groceries and hot foods are incredible and authentic. 

Having grown up in a Lebanese household, I know what middle eastern food should look and taste like, so believe me when I say Pitaland gets it right. 

Their pita bread is the best I've ever had. Their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are always in my fridge in case I want a quick lunch. Their labneh is incredibly addicting. 

Their cafe offers gyros, which are very good. They also have fattoush salad and it's my favorite thing on the menu. I get it with chicken. 

The staff is mostly made up of middle eastern individuals, so they know what they're doing. They're very friendly as well and make relationships with the customers. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed when me and my boyfriend got take out from here! Great prices and the food is huge. The employee that assisted me was extremely friendly and greated me right away. I ordered pita and humus, a falafel, and a gyro and they were amazing! The interior is clean and very nice. They have seating in their cafe. I will certainly be back!! Pitaland is an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"P I T A L A N D! Exceptional Pitas baked daily HOT HOT HOT & Fresh!
Whole wheat & White
This place has everything under the sun :)"}
{"text":"There is something odd about this store and this whole neighborhood.  But still they do have homemade pitas, a huge olive bar and pistachio baklava.  Not as much fun as shopping at Whole Foods or East End Food Coop.  But definitely more genuine."}
{"text":"Great place for your Mediterranean needs. Best gyros ever.  Everything is fresh. The employees are wonderful and will go out of the way to help you. 
Anything that I have ever got there has been delicious."}
{"text":"Heaven.... I was in heaven while strolling through this place. Run by a lovely family who enjoys providing quality food and working with each other. It is contagious and it's what I think of as a happy place because the vibe is good.

I met the owner on a food tour calls Bits and Bites, which I also highly recommend, and he explained the store's history. He is the American dream come true. The pita machine was imported and it was breathtaking. Hot delicious pita is made right there on site and then you can buy an assortment of dips to make your treat complete. They have all the middle eastern staples you could want to make your own authentic food at home if you wish.

They also have a counter where you can prepared food. On my list is the fried cauliflower with hummus. Talk about a power food! So, yeah, make a trip and take it all in. You can get some delicious food, groceries for your pantry and some delicious desserts to go."}
{"text":"Simply excellent.  Amazing food.  Amazing people.  Lamb burger is beyond words.  That grilled halloumi  makes you wonder what you did to deserve it.  I have never had anything bad here...  prepared food, service, or food from the grocery."}
{"text":"I come here for supplies when making tabbouli. And of course I stock up on pitas. They're absolutely amazing and made in-house so you know you're not only getting freshness but authenticity as well.
They carry a lot of fresh, made in-house items like hummus, baba ganoush, desserts and more.
I love that it's also a cafe where you can pop in for brekkie or lunch or shop and eat in one trip."}
{"text":"I just had the best lamb burger in Pittsburgh. I'm not usually fond of too many places that make lamb because I think lamb is tough to make. It's also an acquired taste. The lamb burger here tastes very fresh and I had it made medium since I've never been here before but mine came out a little medium rare, which is actually my favorite way of having a burger. It was very juicy, flavorful and topped with some feta cheese. My mom had the chicken shwarma which was marinated with 100% flavor. If you like your food bland and you're afraid of delicious and strong garlic taste in your food, stay away :) I had a bite and it was very tasty. I will definitely come back again some time for other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Destination grocery shopping at its finest. Order a fresh cooked lunch at the counter and then browse around the store while you wait. After you eat, you can go back and gather all the produce, olives, spices, pickle jars, frozen cheese, bulk grains, party dips, and salads you can carry.  There is always something new to discover and the staff is super friendly. Pitaland will bring a smile to your face!"}
{"text":"I want to live in Pita Land.  I'm thinking of applying for dual citizenship so I can give their fantastic food permanent residence in my happy belly.

I don't know what to recommend more highly, their fluffy glorious gyros (which were the best I've ever had in a city of good gyros), their juicy feta lamb burger, their fresh baked pizza flat breads, their home made baba ganooj and hummus, their massive Mediterranean grocery supply, or their fresh baked pita's which you can watch coming off a conveyer belt carrying them fresh risen out of the oven!

Low prices, big portions, and delicious, perfectly prepared, home made fresh fare.  Go to Pita Land and treat your taste buds to a magical journey to Lebanon's finest!"}
{"text":"Their bread is amazing but they need to work on all the rest. Tried this place three times and every time I said I'm not coming back. It's a bakery, grocery store and a restaurant with some bar style seats. At the beginning, I was excited to try Pitaland because it's the main middle eastern bakery in Pittsburgh area.  It supplies the city with awesome fresh tasty thin pita bread. And they have a brick oven to bake fresh pastries. So you expect they make good wraps, pastries and meals like the rest of the bakeries in other cities. If it's only for the bread, I would give it five stars. Their pita bread is flawless! However, falafels, chicken shawarma, freshly baked cheese and beef pies/sfeehas were all below average. Falafels were very bland and just not right.  The pies (or mana'eesh) were thick and lackluster too. So the food quality on three occasions was 1/5. First experience, I said maybe the cooks had a bad day but it can't be that they had a bad day everyday. I think the most successful restaurant owner is the one who tries their food frequently before serving it. It's really not difficult to make a delicious falafel or chicken sandwich. If you watch a YouTube video about how to make a chicken shawarma wrap, you'll have nicer results. I hate to give negative reviews unless it's for improvement. Service and staff here are slow and not the friendliest. I want this place to be much better and I believe they can."}
{"text":"The BEST PITA made on location ( you can watch it being made through the big picture windows... The new café seating is very inviting... and the gyro's are pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"I use to live in Brookline and this place is awesome. They have great pitas as the name suggests and have several other offerings that are pretty good as well. They also have good Hummes which had become a staple in our house. 

They have a pretty good selection of Mediterranean/italian type groceries and they sell Hookahs and Shisha which is cool. 

If you like good pita's and hummes this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! This gorgeous little Mediterranean grocery has a bakery and a cafe inside. You can find pretty much anything from all over the Mediterranean and Middle East. I highly recommend this place! The service is outstanding."}
