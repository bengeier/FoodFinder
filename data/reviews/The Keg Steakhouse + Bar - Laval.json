{"text":"meilleur repas que j'ai eu de ma vie tout etais exelent le service le cocktail le steak"}
{"text":"Great steaks and good service. I hate playing dress up so I won't go here too often. Menu is expensive but the food is well worth the price and the meat is very well prepared."}
{"text":"Très bon service menu avec beaucoup de choix bon choix de vin pour ce qui est de la cuisson du steak le mien j'ai demander médium saignant mais reçu saignant bleu pour le reste de mon assiette elle était parfaite les légumes bonne cuisson et ce qui est du dessert juste un mot wow meilleur gâteau au carotte que j'ai jamais manger si ma cuisson aurai été fait à mon goût j'aurais donné un 5 étoiles sur de revenir pour un autre essai"}
{"text":"Nice place , good food brut the girls should change clothing too much to show too much in an inappropriate place"}
{"text":"AMAZING  BEST steaks in Laval, amazing service   The food is always great at the Keg, beautiful restaurant great modern decor, bar is great fast service even when it's super busy friendly staff.  In summer it's the best place to be on the roof top bar  u can eat relax and enjoy Ur food.  Great hangout place for the summer."}
{"text":"La première fois que je suis allé dans un Keg, c'est dans les montagnes de la Colombie-Britanique, dans la ville de Kamloops, c'était vraiment beau et féerique...  Bref, la gastronomie dans l'ouest, a part des millions de sushis..., la gastronomie est fade et décevante!  Heureusement que j'ai découvert le Keg!!!  Chaque fois que je devais aller sur la Cote Ouest, il fallait absolument que j'arrête au Keg à Kamloops!  Moi qui a fait quelques Steak House dans tout l'Amérique du Nord...  Le Keg est difficile à battre! Tout est géniale dans le menu et lorsque je rentre dans le Keg à Laval..., cela me fait revivre les images splendides de la Colombie-Britanique...., les Glaciers, les Séquoias..., les rivières..., les montagnes..."}
{"text":"Impeccable food,  great ambiance.  Our first time here, definitely not the last.  If you happen to get Samuel for a waiter... you have got it made!!!  Don't hesitate to make your reservation!!!"}

{"text":"Excellent!  12oz Top Sirloin was cooked perfect medium, salad and sides were great too!  Service very good."}
{"text":"My first trip to the Keg was a pleasant experience. The place was very clean and the service was fast. I went around 4 pm a few days before Christmas, reservation was not needed.   Steak was cooked to perfection and very juicy, the twice baked potato was delicious. The billy miner pie is basically mocha ice cream topped with chocolate and caramel sauce, but it is really good.   My only regret is the carrot cake. For such a measly slice, it was way overpriced (around 10$) and nothing special. I usually never get carrot cake at restaurants, but I wanted to try it and compare it to homemade. I didn't complain, because the rest of my meal was perfect.   Go for the steak and billy miner pie!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant on a Monday night. I ordered the Manhattan , I'm not a big meat eater and I ordered it med well. The lobster meat on the plate was five pieces but very tasty and the meat..well it was good but I'm not a fan . Few asparagus and tasty garlic mash. Topped off the meal with a mocha pie ice cream and I was over filled. I should of ordered the bite sized dessert but alas my husband wanted to try the pie. Service was attentive and decor was nice. All said and done, good but I probably would not go back. My husband enjoyed his meal therefore he would but not with me."}
{"text":"I stopped in here twice in the last three weeks with some coworkers and both times had a pleasant experience.  The service was professional and friendly and the food was excellent.  we were initially told there would be a 45 minute wait but there we weren't in a rush so this wasn't an issue.  While we were in the waiting area, a waitress quickly came over and took drink orders which was a pleasant surprise.  after we got our drinks we were seated in only 15 minutes.  The first time I ordered the small filet-mignon and the second time I was less hungry so I ordered the salmon.  The filet was cooked medium rare exactly the way I wanted it, and the salmon was very good as well.  The service was great and our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful.  we had a few general steak questions and his answers and descriptions of where each cut of meat came from were above and beyond what we were looking for.  On our second trip we mentioned to the waitress that there was a birthday at the table and she quickly brought over a large slice of coffee ice cream cake.  We all shared it and it was delicious.  Overall I would gladly return anytime I'm looking for a good steak."}
{"text":"We loved this spot even though it was a chain. The keg is such a trendy restaurant with great menu options. We ordered a bottle of Canadian red wine to share with our meal too. Our waitress was great and friendly.  For starters, we had the tuna Tatar and escargot. The tuna tartar was tasty and fresh. The escargot had a nice Indian spice to it. I also got a house salad and bacon wrapped scallops. The house salad was a nice big size, with lots of fresh veggies. The bacon wrapped scallops were delicious, tender, and juicy- but much smaller than I imagined.   Overall, our first dinner experience in French Canada was great. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was quite cool too. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Went alone while on a business trip. Very busy but quickly seated at the bar by request.  Great service by the bar team (3 of them handling the area). Respectable beer selection, I got a local beer and the prime rib. Very good!  Their horseradish was the hottest I've ever had...excellent with the meat.   I'll def go back."}
{"text":"Ok, c'est un steakhouse faque on fait pas le saut quand on vois les prix, s'il vous plait. Service excellent, bonne ambiance, la bouffe était délicieuse, voilà!"}
{"text":"Le keg, un grand classique !  Celui de Laval ne fait pas exception au reste de la chaîne, la qualité est vraiment dans l'assiette. Le steak est toujours délicieux et le service impeccable, au bar comme aux tables.  N'hésitez pas à réserver même pour deux car c'est difficile d'avoir une place, surtout la fin de semaine. Surtout lorsque la terrasse en haut est fermée. Parlant de cette terrasse, je vous recommande un bon souper en plein air lorsqu'il fait beau, c'est une expérience en soi.  Malgré le temps d'attente très long (sans réservation), le personnel est toujours 100% compétent et fait plus que demandé pour vous rendre heureux. On aime ça !  ps : bloody Keg extra fèves !!!"}
{"text":"Usually this is one of my favorite restaurents (I always go to Place Ville Marie usually). But this time I was pretty dissapointed.  I know the specialty is steak but I always take that so this time I got the ribs. They were very bad. TINY portion, over cooked and boring sauce. Nothing special. What a waste of money...  Ive learned my lesson... always get the steaks."}
{"text":"Came to try it tonight & was very disappointed! There's many steakhouses I would recommend in Montreal before this one! Beautiful decor, but bad food! Its doesn't help that you pay a fortune too! For the price they charge, they should give better quality and modernize their menu."}
{"text":"The lounge was a great place to sit BUT,unfortunately the Caesar salad and the grill on the steak did not match my expectations of Keg standards. Will probably go back but I will expect the Keg I am used to."}
{"text":"Premièrement je dois avouer que je ne suis pas fan des restaurants \"annexés\" à un centre commercial, mais je crois que le choix est logique pour Laval puisque beaucoup de choses semblent graviter autour de ce centre commercial.   La déco m'a semblé plutôt froide et masculine, quoique, encore là, il s'agit d'un choix logique pour attirer le mâle mangeur de viande ;), et il était difficile de s'installer confortablement à notre table.  Et finalement la nourriture, parce que c'est quand même pour ça que j'y allais, ne m'a pas déçue. Je connaissais déjà la chaîne pour y être aller dans le Vieux-Montréal à quelques reprises et j'étais déjà fan.  Bref, l'expérience fut plaisante, mais je préfère clairement l'ambiance de la succursale du Vieux-Montréal qui s'approche plus du type \"resto chic\" que l'ambiance \"bar class\" de Laval."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. Definitely more beautiful than you would expect for something attached to a mall.  Sandy escargot, slow, non-communicative service and an hour and a half wait for a table. In terms of the food, other than the disappointment of the sandy escargot it was OK. Shared the prime rib which was juicy and cooked perfectly. Hubs had the Keg Burger which was, in his words, meh. The coleslaw that came with the burger did have cilantro in it, which is odd. While it is very refreshing to those who like cilantro, my hubs is not one of those people and it put him off the rest of his meal. The Billy Miner Pie that they gave my Mom for her birthday was amazing. Even the bill was a challenge to process. Applied gift card to the wrong cheque. Server disappeared without explaining what happened. 10 minutes passed before he returned with the manager to do some creative accounting to fix the issue.  TL;DR - service was awful, food was just OK."}
{"text":"Had a great supper at the Keg.  Great menu selection for both food and beverages.   Nice atmosphere, music, and comfortable seating.   I had started with the Wedge salad - excellent choice, had bacon bits and dressing!   for the main course, i had the Prime Rib... the 10oz size was a nice size, with nice trimmings garlic mash potatoes and veggies.     I would definately go back here, and looking forward to the new one opening up at Fairview Pointe-Claire."}
{"text":"I am a customer regular of the keg,I thought this keg in Laval is very chic,I like so much the washroom here....hahahaha!the service was ok.,not wow!!!"}
{"text":"The last time I reviewed this restaurant was 3 years ago. I am sad to say that the service has not changed at all.  Slow service - all 5 of us at the table commented on how long it took to get the food and in fact, one person at our table asked the waitress if we could expect our food anytime soon.  Taste-  Everything was very bland. We ordered fried calamari and in our calamari we got fried sweet potatoes and french fries, meaning they use the same oil for everything! The lobster tacos I had tasted like calamari and french fries as well. That oil badly needs to be changed.  My husband hated his plate. He had bacon wrapped chicken and everything went back. It just wasn't good.  The other two guests had steak and they didn't have any complaints on the taste of their food (but they are super healthy so they didn't want oil, butter, sauce, etc.... its hard to screw up grilling a steak...at a steak house).  The Keg is just an over priced venue in Laval. Their name keeps attracting new clients but I don't think they get too much repeat business."}
{"text":"Just went there for a New Year Eve's dinner.  It was quite packed even at 5:45 pm.  Since we didn't have a reservation we had to wait about 40 minutes.  Luckily, we weren't that hungry at the time.  I guess a lot of people go there for dinner after shopping at the mall.  Surprisingly, quite a few parties brought their kids but no crying or screaming.  Thank God.  The decor of the restaurant looks chic and upscale.  Ambiance nice and relaxed.  Food was excellent.  Overall a good dining experience.  No mishaps.  Except maybe the restrooms.  At first glance, you couldn't tell which one is for women and which one for men."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying this place when I was in Montreal for a wedding. Went on a Friday night with four ladies. We expected a lengthy wait because it was bustling but we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately at a spacious booth with a view of the bar. The waitress was a doll and made several recommendations and joined in the humorous banter among cousins. The steak is what you come for but since two of us weren't feeling red meat we each tried the salmon. Both preps were outstanding. The rest of the girls got various steaks and each came out the way it was requested so absolutely no complaints. We all had variations of potatoes as sides (baked, fried, mashed and twice baked). Again no complaints there. I started with a mixed greens salad with a champagne vinaigrette which was light and delicious. The table started with calamari which was also excellent. The server brought of hot baked bread and butter for all and offered to replenish. No skimping here. Ordered a bottle of wine to he shared by all. And a birthday dessert also recommended by the waitress.   After dinner the waitress had the bar manager walk us to the rooftop bar which was too cold and rainy to enjoy but good to know existed for future visits!   We also got to enjoy a variety of cocktails at the bar. Televisions surrounded showing replays of hockey (what else)Overall an excellent experience. For fellow yelpers out there looking for an amazing meal with a cool hip atmosphere: This is the place."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar on a business trip. Was greeted and take to the bar. This place is popping busy with a great atmosphere. The bar tender was super fast. Orders the stake and lobster. The food came out extremely fast and perfectly cooked. Delicious. Great looking waitresses. Creem Brullete was home made.  Great place."}
{"text":"I was seriously impressed how nice this place was when I walked in. Lots of room to move around, a really high ceiling, a huge bar, two floors with everything looking sleek n' modern and aesthetically pleasing. Breathtaking!  I was here for a work Christmas dinner and we were provided the VIP dinner room in the back area of the 2nd floor. Beautiful long table, comfortable chairs and beautiful decorations. On top of that a huge foyer that enhanced the whole vibe.  Now the grub :  - I had the Caesar salad and it was sublime. It was a real treat and possibly the best Caesar salad I've eaten in a long time.  - I went with their top sirloin that came with a baked potato and an extra stick of shrimp. I usually don't like to order my meat medium-rare in restos as most places get it wrong and go for a more safe medium but since this place is a well-known steakhouse... so I rolled the dice.... AND GREAT SUCCESS! I actually got it medium-rare!!! And more importantly... it was FANTASTIC!!!! Juicy, flavorful and succulent this slab of meat was the highlight of my evening.   \"Oh red meat, how I missed thee!\"  - The shrimp were also really good as well and I'll furthermore state it was a perfectly baked potato as well.  - For desert, I went with the strawberry cheesecake and while it wasn't the best I've had it was still pretty decent.  The service was attentive and on point. I have nothing to say here other than kudos Keg staff on doing a great job all night long..  Normally, I'll also mention the price-tag but hey.. my employer paid for the meal.... soo.....LIFE IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.  All in all, the place was a huge success for us and I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Dans la section bar c'est plus relax.  Une bonne bouteille de blanc avec des entrées . Donc on commande une entrée de calamares frits qui etait bien présentée, croustillants et pas huileux. Le tartare de thon aussi etait très bien avec un fond d'avocat très frais.  Les frites aussi bonnes malgré qu'elles sont congelées.  Le service dans la section bar a été fait efficacement par 3 différentes personnes.  Grand stationnement extérieur. Belle ambiance de steak house."}
{"text":"Terrific steakhouse.    Great attentive service, nice decor, comfortable seating -- very nice for a business meal or night out.    All the steaks at our table were outstanding.    This place does not have good signage.   It is in the back of a large shopping mall.  We had some difficulty finding it, but I am glad we did.   It was the best meal of our short trip."}
{"text":"Décor élégant et luxueux. La lumière est tamisée donc un endroit parfait pour un dîner en amoureux.  Service professionnel; le serveur a bien pris la peine de nous expliquer les spéciaux, le menu et nous faire des suggestions.   J'ai commandé la queue de homard de l'Atlantique avec purée de pomme de terres. Mon copain a commandé le Crabe royal de l'Alaska.  Les deux sont absolument délicieux.  Le homard est bien tendre et présentée afin de pouvoir le manger facilement. Nous avons dévoré les deux plats qui étaient immenses et tellement savoureux.   Ce qui est génial à Laval, ce qui n'y avait pas de file d'attente comme au Vieux Port de Montréal.  C'est assez dispendieux comme soirée mais il n'y a aucun regret par la suite!"}
{"text":"The minute I walked in I was impressed, with the high ceilings and nice decor with lots of room to move around. Was immediately greeted and shown to our seat. Nice looking place clean and again lots of room so you don't feel squeezed. The waiter was great took our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. He was very helpful and knew the menu he answered all of our questions without hesitation. We ordered calamari for our appetizer which where very good and also the only reason I gave this place 4 stars was because the woman who brought them out to our table (not our waiter) gave the hot plate to me in my hands rather than make room and place it in the middle of our table. Unacceptable!  As for the main dishes we tried sirloin steak, strip loin steak, and filet mignon. All cooked to perfection & very tasty. All the sides mashed potatoes and Asiago rice were delicious. Over all great experience but the runners helping the waiters should know better. Will go back simply for the great steaks they serve."}
{"text":"When a co-worker told me that there was a steakhouse next to the P. F. Chang I figured I would give it a try. I got home from my meetings, put on my blue jeans and a T-Shirt and made my way to what I thought was going to be a basic steak and bar restaurant. I found that I was very much under dressed. The Keg Steakhouse and Bar isn't you standard slab of meat and a beer kind of place, if you aren't wearing a button up shirt and probably a tie you are going to feel very out of place.  The interior was amazingly well maintained and clean. The service was polite and fast. As expected the prices were high, but it was clear that a great deal of care was put into the meal. My only real complaint was the portions. You can pick how big you want your cut of meat (so you can't complain about that) but the sides were a little on the skimpy side. About half of my plate was empty space. Now I am not accustom to dining in such places, but to me it was a little off. The steak was nice and juicy and the sides were great. I would come back, but I would wear a nicer shirt next time."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Laval, the Keg is a resto with lots of fun vibes. It's a chain in Canada.  The decor is amazing, the staff is very professional. The food is amazing you have a variety of different steaks & fish. The entrées are as delicious.  This particular location is one of the best & my favorite. They also have a good variety of good wines. Overall a very satisfying experience. For the quality of food the prices are decent. It's not my first experience & definitely not the last"}
{"text":"Very good food! Didn't have to wait a long time to receive our food and it was amazing ! The wait time was around 1:00-1:30 hours, however, there's couches and space on the second floor where you can rest ! No waiting outside . The desert is really good as well. Would come again !"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes flavorful and delicious. The service was great and the decor at the place impressive. Great spot and definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Wow, the design and decor of this new Keg in Laval is just breathtaking!    The Keg is known for Steak or Prime Rib!  Prices are typically higher than your Ponderosa Steakhouse but quality is usually a bit less than a Ruth's Chris or Morton's.  None the less it's very good quality!    To start of the meal as always the wonderful 2010 J. Lohr Cab Sav which was excellent as always!  Then we ordered the Calamari and some type of smoky cream dip which was enjoyed by our group of 5.    For my meal I ordered the Petit Oscar.  A fillet with shrimp/scallops with some asparagus and a nice bernaise sauce to boot!  I use to eat my beef medium well.  Then I graduated to medium rare.  Now I move to rare as it's so much more tender! A co-worker ordered the short ribs and others ordered different steak.    All in all we were really satisfied on a good meal during a stormy night!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar went there after shopping few days before Christmas me and my girlfriend paid 150 with tips for two but the service wasn't top notch though and food not enough!!!"}
{"text":"I genuinely like The Keg but I'm giving this location 3 stars based on 2 visits. One was fantastic and the other one left a lot to be desired.  I won't spend much time on my first visit, the food and service were amazing as you would expect. I would give it 4 stars; somehow, I always think The  Keg is overpriced.   My 2nd visit would be 2 stars. The food was great but the service was terrible. 1st offence: we waited 25 minutes before getting noticed by our waitress. Mind you, we already had cocktails in our hands but I find 25 minutes without stopping by to ask us anything quite long. We had to flag her down and her excuse was she thought we were waiting on someone. Fair enough but she could have at least stop at some point and ask.   2nd offence: my mother and I were drinking sparkling water and my father was sipping his Dry Martini. All served in similar glasses(the man requires and old-fashioned like glass). The waitress comes around and fills up our glasses with tap water! All three of them, that includes the martini! Call me pretentious but when you can't notice the very visible bottle of sparkling water(right by one of the glasses she filled up with tap water) and can't remember that your patron was sipping a cocktail that is just some weak service.   3rd offence: my mother suffers from coeliac disease and was offered a gluten-free menu but no special services. The Keg is usually pretty good at avoiding cross-contamination and they're always helpful at helping you pick out a meal that will meet your allergy requirements. 9/10 times the manager will come and make sure that what you're ordering is okay. Not this time around!  We didn't mind at first as she knows the menu very well;however, my mother was sick all night long from cross-contamination. It is the waiter's job to inform the kitchen and people with allergies have to trust and rely on them. If the waiter doesn't communicate well with the kitchen then you end up bring sick.   The service at this location simply is uneven. You might have a great experience or a terrible one!  The food and decor are on par and the wine list is a tad short and repetitive."}
{"text":"I have been here quite often and not once was I disappointed. One of the b st steakhouses I have been too. Always cooked to your liking. Great staff, and wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"oui fans de viandes c'est la place j adore le steak et tout ce qui viens avec pour mettre ca   simple  saaaavvvvoooouuurrreeeeuuuxxxxxx le service souriant des serveurs la place le choix est votre il y as aucun mauvais choix pas besoin d énuméré laissé vos papilles saliver je recommande des réservations et l été la terrasse as essayé aussi bien le bar quelque soit l endroit vous allez adoré .....ici le plaisir est pour toi....."}
{"text":"This was across the street from my hotel and I just popped in for a beer and a burger.  Steak place... How bad could their burgers be?  They were out!  Out of burgers, unbelievable"}
{"text":"All our plates came wrong . 3 chicken plates came completely burned, steak was well done instead of medium. The manager on the floor was a complete liar, said to redo chicken will be 26 mins, i said i will never wait this long (i was starving...literally) , then came back said it will be done in 6 minutes. After 30 mins he brought the plate when the whole table finished eating. I refused the whole plate, and this whole Keg experience. As a matter of fact, he could have at least offer to cover my drinks. I dine at Keg up to 3 times a week, and service like this is unacceptable. I hope the chef who was there never works another day. Manager should get changed too incompetent for big steakhouse chain like Keg. They got good location, but bad team. Change things up , before its too late.. and I will never step my feet inside again at Keg Laval. McDonald's probably will serve you more efficiently and with better customer service."}
{"text":"Dang!  Who knew The Keg was so swanky?  I remember the days when it was more of a casual family eatery.  The Laval location is located in the massive shopping mall Carrefour Laval and is huge inside spanning two floors and featuring a rooftop terrasse.  Everything looks so modern and elegant.  It makes you feel so fancy.  I was here for an early dinner on a Tuesday and the restaurant was surprisingly busy for a week night so I would highly recommend a reservation.  Now let's talk about the most important part of the experience: the food.  The Keg's claim to fame is steak so it made sense to order that.  I'm not the biggest steak eater around but I really enjoyed the one that I had here.  The cut was a sirloin and I ordered it medium rare.  They got the cook just right so the inside was so juicy while the outside had a proper grilled taste to it.    For dessert they offer mini versions of some of their dessert menu items.  This is a great idea because I really wanted dessert but I couldn't handle a full one all to myself because the regular portions were rather large.  I ended up ordering a mini brownie and I enjoyed it a lot.  It was ver dense and chocolatey and it was very warm when they still served it to me.   The service could have been a little better but it wasn't terrible either.  It was just a bit slow at times.  I have definitely experienced much worse though.  If you're looking for a budget meal The Keg is definitely not the place to visit because the price tag can be steep.  You can definitely justify treating yourself once in a while because this is one of those places worth the occasional splurge.  Despite not being a massive steak fan I really enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"Was there Saturday, I had prime rib and wife had steak. Both were great, the service was fantastic. Nice job and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food Great staff  I'm a regular customer. I tried almost everything on the menu and it's all amazing.  Amazing staff and service   Summer time is a blast on the terrasse at the keg laval"}
{"text":"I thought I left a review here a week ago but so sick luck.  So without further ado.    The place has a great vibe to it and they are very accommodating.  In fact, I tried to book another restaurant in the area for my party of 12 and it was not possible.  The keg gladly accepted and despite an appearance of being full, they found us a private dining room upstairs. Awesome!    The steaks, wine, appetizers, deserts and ambiance were perfect.    Will definitely be back.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arrived with 4 co-workers and was told it was a 1 hour wait. I said fine, we will go elsewhere for dinner. Suddenly the manager arrives and locates a table off to the side which was remote, but we were there for a great steak and a couple of drinks. We had filet mignon, New York, Rib Eye and a generic steak. All great, as to be expected. Drinks were acceptable. Service was on par for a Keg, but not awesome.  Our only complaint was the 69 minute wait between apps and mains. We had to search out our server to speed it up. Will return for the great steaks of course."}
{"text":"I had not gone to the keg for years and really never liked it til now. I ordered steak with mushrooms and it was just awesome. We went there for my sons b-day and this was his choice.  I would have given 5 stars but the waiter just refused to speak to me in English. I would have paid 20% tip but paid 15 and gave 4 stars for that.  In my business I speak to the chinese in chinese. It's called service. But its just a Quebec thing. XENOPHOBIC!!!!"}
{"text":"Depuis mon régime cerogene (keto), il m'est difficile de manger à l'extérieur en respectant mes macros. The keg est un des rares restaurants permettant de voir en ligne tout les information nutritionnel clair et précis pour chaque repas. Ce restaurant m'offre plusieurs choix de plats qui entre dans mes macros.  J'ai essayé le steak baseball et le filet mignon. Bien sur j'ai préféré le filet mignon, mais beaucoup. Le baseball était bon aussi mais il comportait trop de nerf ou de gras, chose que je n'aime pas sur la viande. Mais les suces et accompagnement était tous très bon, la viande cuite parfaitement. Ma compagne a bien aimé aussi ses multiples choix.  Par contre, il faut s'attendre à payer le prix pour une tel qualité de viande. J'ai trouvé par contre le service pas super, ce qui explique l'étoile en moins. C'était très long de prendre ma commande et de revenir prendre les assiettes un coup terminé, sans compter l'attente pour la facture et le paiement de cette dernière."}
