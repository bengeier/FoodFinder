{"text":"I really love this place!! Great food, very clean, super friendly staff. I definitely recommend for all. My favorite is their pad Thai! The only recommendation I would suggest is having more options when it comes to drinks, of course when dining in. Over all I love it and I am glad to have another vegetarian/vegan place to have here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Not only is the food really good and perfect for anyone looking for a tasty vegetarian/vegan meal, the staff is amazing.  Every time I order I get the food perfectly made, it is not thrown together, and in my opinion that happens almost every where especially if the staff is in a rush but not at Veggie Village.  I recommend the stir fry, pot stickers, and burger.  I still have to try to rest of the menu and since it is close to my work, I probably will make it a habit to go in for lunch weekly.  Even if you are not a meat eater, I strongly suggest giving Veggie Village a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"best vegetarian in AZ..you need to try! very healthy, yummy and good service! try their bento..come with nice salad and healthy soup!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how good the food at Veggie Village really is. I absolutely love being able to order anything on the menu without worrying about hidden meat or stock of some sort. Veggie Village is the best for Chinese food night. We always have a ton of leftovers that still taste amazing a day or two later (they usually don't last that long though!)"}
{"text":"Been a while since we've been here due to work/newborn, but this place is the real deal. Amazing for vegan/vegetarians and the food is worth rewarding yourself for/taking your SO to dinner. We always get the sesame chicken (v chicken) and general tso(v chicken). We always split it and leave full but when we get home I'm ready to eat more lol. Their egg rolls are good and the pot stickers are the mvp for appetizer."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back! Best vegan meal we have had in a long time! Miso soup, rainbow salad and Kung Pao V-chicken"}
{"text":"The Orange Peel veggie-Chicken was superb. Another in the party said the same about the General Tso veggie-Chicken. The facilities are pleasant and clean. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here after seeing it often and reading the yelp reviews. I was so pleased with my experience. It's a walk up counter, but the decor is hip and the restaurant is meticulously clean. I had the veggie curry with white rice and it was delicious. I ordered mine to-go and it was ready for me to take it in less than 7 minutes. The woman taking my order was helpful and friendly, and gave recommendations without pressuring me to order more. The pictures of the food and the presentation is beautiful! I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"I've been eating off this Japanese noodle/ Kung Pao chicken to go order since yesterday. That's a lie... I ate all of the chicken last night. I couldn't stop. The cashier was friendly and the whole restaurant had such a good vibe. The fake shrimp in the noodle dish freaked me out at first in all their jiggly glory, but they are pretty good. I'm already thinking about my next order of that \"chicken\". I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I love when new veggie restaurants open up in the valley...and this one is on point :) The pot stickers, yum...but the orange peel V-Chicken, DELISH! I can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Just simply delicious...we had the Kung Pao and Orange chicken  (which was tofu )
Almost taste better than chicken....I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Place was greeeeaaaaat!  We will be back for shizzle. Great food.  Inexpensive.  Amazing flavors.  All vegetarian.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Veggie Village just opened near my apartment and I'm so thankful. The food is delicious! This will be a regular spot for my girlfriend and I!"}
{"text":"Quick stop on the road, really didnt want the usual chain restaurant fare. OMG, the food was awesome! Fresh, quick, tasty, healthy, and inexpensive, doesnt get any better!"}
{"text":"Delightful find, pleasant inside and food is delicious. So glad to have this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is bland, boring, no taste. Ordered the Orange  veggie chicken and Kung Pao veggie chicken. They both just lacked overall taste. Something just isn't quite right about the recipe but the flavors just aren't there. Ordered the pot stickers which were pretty tasty surprisingly. Other than that the service is pretty bad the server spent her time either eating behind the register or somewhere in the back. I had to stand up n ask to get my water refilled twice. This place just needs to figure it out I don't know what else to say definitely not worth it. Try some other place"}
{"text":"It's like my prayers to have a veg Asian restaurant 2 minutes from my house have been answered! I've tried a few things on the menu, but ever since I first tried the jap chae noodles that's all I order. They're Korean glass noodles in a savory sauce and I seriously crave them all the time.. it's an addiction. My boyfriend, who is not vegan, is just as excited about Veggie Village as I am, and he loves all of the \"chicken\" dishes made with fried mushrooms. Everything on the menu can be made vegan, which is a huge plus for me. Also, the two ladies who answer the phone for takeout and man the register are always super sweet and polite! I've seen the place packed wall-to-wall around dinnertime, so go a little early if you like a quieter atmosphere."}
{"text":"We finally got a vegan restaurant in our neck of the woods!  Everything we've had was delicious and the owners are the nicest people. The menu is almost all vegan with one exception of an appetizer that contains cream cheese. We've tried the sesame chicken (the chicken in this dish is breaded fried mushrooms), orange chicken, general tso chicken, sweet and sour chicken, Tim yam fish, roti prata, fried enoki, lettuce wraps - everything is fresh and delicious. They've only been open a week or two and we've been 4 times. They only have iced water to drink right now but once their cooler is working they may offer some bottled drinks. Oh and they're closed Saturdays. We will do our part to support such a great place because we want them to succeed and stay right here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! I lived in Los Angeles for 17 years and recently moved to Phoenix. Seriously this place offers very tasty but not oily food. I had been to so many other Asian vegetarian restaurants in CA in the past. There are some great restaurants with a huge variety of vegan and vegetarian food. And this place definitely can compete with those restaurants in LA when it comes to the taste and quality. It is a sort of small restaurant, but if you have never tried Asian style vegetarian food. You MUST try their food here at least once and you will be the judge. I am just so pleased with the fact that they are so close to where I live. I do not need to go all the way to Chandler or Mesa to get some ok Asian food (especially vegetarian food). Thank you!"}
{"text":"Potstickers are excellent! Enjoyed everything I ordered. Great service-- attentive and helpful! Able to accommodate bigger party last minute graciously without compromising on quality of experience. Would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Just ate here on their first day open.  So excited to have them in the neighborhood.  An original spin on vegetarian dining.  They have a great menu with many options, mostly Chinese restaurant classics.  

I had the Sesame \"Chicken\" which was actually mushrooms that were battered, fried, and covered in a delicious sauce.  My sweetie had the rainbow salad and chose the plum dressing, light and sweet. Jicama!!! I do wish they had gluten free options (lots of soy sauce here), they said they were looking into it.

The place looks great inside, very clean, big booths, new floor, tinted windows.  The staff is awesome, everyone friendly.  They are a family business.  They played some newer American pop music on the radio.  While not my taste in tunes, it did seem to fit the mood of the place nicely and I wasn't bothered by it.

All in all I'm glad they're here, and I'll be back to try every single item on the menu."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time recently - did not realise this was mainly Asian cuisine.  However, we did enjoy our meal.   Vegetable curry very tasty though I did not enjoy what I think were Shitake mushrooms.  My husband had the orange chicken which he enjoyed.   Food presented quickly and good sized portions, and good value.   Think I will try spring rolls next time though."}
{"text":"It is a great place for Vegetarian. I love the food here, so delicious and health. It a new restaurant in LA, but the awesome one!"}
{"text":"Loved my dinner here. What an oasis for vegans and vegetarians. I will definitely be coming back multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Great place for Vegan and Vegetarian. Food is delicious and the place is clean and cozy. Chef and the waiter (probably owners) are nice. The price is reasonable compared to other Vegans place. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"EXPERIENCE: This has been a great experience. My girlfriend and I just left what felt like a community dining experience. The front man was very friendly. He followed up with us on our orders since it was our first time in and had some small talk about the roti pratta we tried since my gf introduced this to me, I was not disappointed. 

FOOD: as appetizers we ordered potstickers and roti pratta. I have never tried rp before and it was amaze-balls. The bread was moist and fluffy, and I loved the curry sauce with it. While the girl ordered pad thai, I went with the Singapore noodles. That was quite a treat too. Very colorful and tasteful with their spices. A recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great food! Even better for being vegetarian! Very clean and sleek, light ambience, and very reasonable prices.  The choices are nice and the folks are super friendly"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place based on the four to five star reviews & I was excited that I was able to stumble upon a place that caters to vegetarians & Vegans which is a plus. Now about what I ordered...

Tonight I ordered the orange chicken & burger to go. When I try a new place, I always order two dishes just in case one is not so great. The total meal cost a little over $14.00

The orange chicken was pretty bland and unfortunately soggy; which was sad because I only had a 9 minute drive back to my destination. Plus there was not much of the orange sauce on the chicken or in the container which would have been nice to mix with the white rice .

The burger was pretty tasty, it comes with fries. I didn't feel a need to add any additional toppings to it when I arrived home. I would definitely order this again.

The final verdict: the orange chicken was a bust, but the burger saved the night!! Four stars overall.

There are other options that look good, so I will give this place another chance to see if I'll stick with my current rating. Maybe next time I'll dine in to see if my experience is different.."}
{"text":"I love the food here and will return again and again until I've sample the entire menu. 

....however...

I recommend that you don't go there if you are going to arrive more than an hour before they close. In fact, if it's getting late you may want to call ahead and ask how late they are actually willing to serve. 

We arrived at 8:30 pm Friday evening. Closing time posted on the door was at 9:00 - even though the hours on yelp and their website say 9:30. We were rushed to order, appetizers arrived and the entrees showed up about 4 minutes later so we had a huge jam of plates and bowls on the table. At 10 minutes after 9:00 one of the employees (maybe the owner / manager?) stood and glared at us. It was very uncomfortable. 

We were a party of 4, ordered appetizers, beverages and entrees and we tip well - but didn't feel very welcome during our stay. 

Maybe they just need to adjust their hours and say they close at 8:00 pm?"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or a meat eater you will love it! You have to get the lettuce wraps and dumplings! I had the Pad Thai and it was super flavorful- I made adjustments to make it vegan. My meat eating boyfriend had a noodle dish and loved it as well!"}
{"text":"First time here. Brought a friend who is vegetarian and my son who just about lives at McDonalds. Absolutely the best vegetarian/vegan dishes around. Every dish was perfect. My son ordered the Sweet and Sour V-chicken. Sauce to die for, mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, pineapple, cleaned his plate. I had Singapore noodles, not one noodle left. My friend had the vegetable dish and purred the whole time.
All of us will be back numerous times. This is not fast food, it's food done well."}
{"text":"Love this place for when me and the Mrs start to try to dry out a bit from meat . Such flavorful and filling vegetarian and vegan food ! A lot of times when we try to cook veg/vegan at home we aren't able to find fullness or are hungry again in a few hours. This place does plant based non soy proteins right. Absolutely love it. Great service at the bar always (our favorite place to sit.)"}
{"text":"The food was good and beautiful. We enjoyed the variety of options and the friendly service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Reasonably priced. Very clean. Nice decor. Fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Jewel in this strip mall."}
{"text":"I love this place it's total vegan the miso soup is soooo good if you're vegan you should really go here"}
{"text":"Was very yummy! Me and my boyfriend shared two appatizers (nan bread and curry sauce and veggie dumplings) and we got the village fried rice. The servings are huge and was plently food. We enjoyed the meal very much. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Not vegan, but I wanted to try it after driving past a couple days ago. I had the lettuce wraps, orange chicken and spiced salt fish - everything was awesome and just the right amount of food for two people."}
{"text":"I LOVE their menu options. They have a little bit of everything for everyone. The hot and sour soup was delicious and their vegan chicken had a good texture and flavor. It's good to know that you have to specify if the dish is vegan or not because they do have some dairy they use, which I wish they would not. Overall great atmosphere, decent pricing for the portions and friendly service. Will definitely be back to explore the menu time and time again."}
{"text":"This was a total surprise!!
Who knew you could have such delicious food, great service, kind staff, and healthy options all at the same place? The gluten-free options are good as well. We highly recommend the Vietnamese Rolls, The Hawaiian fried rice, and the Kung Pao chicken. Herbaceous cuisine that has us full and in a healthy manner. Also try the chia seed honeydew juice. 
What a gift to your palette! We certainly suggest that you treat yourself to this excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, staff, cleanliness, service and I'm totally obsessed with their menu. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I've been Vegan for a short time and this place was just amazing. Several styles of Asian fare, and of family of four was all happy with what they got. They can prepare anything on the menu vegan at your request.  Portions were generous and prices seemed right on."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here several times for lunch and gotten a few different things and have never been disappointed. So happy to have more vegan restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! We got our food to go but everything was really good!! Got all vegan options. The sesame v-chicken was my favorite!!! Ginger chicken was too intense for me. Cream cheese wontons were perfect! Ordering was quick and easy, food was ready in 15 minutes, and nice service!"}
{"text":"Yummm!  As a new vegetarian who travels alot, I really appreciate a good vegetarian spot. Service was great but the dish I ordered was bomb!  Orange \"chicken\" with brown rice.  I asked for it spicy. It had just enough heat and I swear I was eating chicken!  I wish they had a location in Tucson!!!"}
{"text":"Super good vegan Chinese food! The orange chicken tasted just like chicken but entirely vegan. Pricing was super reasonable as well, with a dinner entree being less than 10 bucks. Menus a bit limited currently with no dessert options, however I look forward to seeing what they have in the next few years!"}
{"text":"From out of town: I cannot say enough about how much I loved this place. I'm really sad that I won't be able to come here after today. I highly recommend this place if you want flavor and diversity."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. After a long hike we decided to grab some lunch. I was looking for something light but yummy. I love vegan food and have a lot of respect for vegan's so I decided today I want to try out a vegan restaurant in the area. My husband knows of vegan meat meat but his first choice would be fast food. Before bringing it up to him that I already had I mind where I wanted to go I yelp searched vegan and up popped Veggie Village. It had good reviews and it's Asian inspired which is a plus because my husband loves orange chicken. So I convinced him and we headed our way.

As we walked in we were immediately greeted with menus and seated. Staff was friendly and made accommodations to my meal. I ordered the lettuce wraps and my husband order the orange chicken lunch special. As we waited for our food I kept hoping he would like the food the last thing I would want to do is make him hate vegan meat. Our food came out pretty quickly although we were the only ones there at the time. As he took the first couple of bites I waited and asked \"how is it?\" He said \"this is really good!\" My heart felt so happy! And my lettuce wraps were yummy too! We will be back. And to top it off we got full off the plates which is a plus! All very affordable as well."}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect from this place. But oh my gosh, if you are considering visiting Veggie Village, do it!! 

Great variety of dishes, really tasty food, obviously we will had to go back for more!  SOON

Great value for money, very clean, and staff were so friendly."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! Lots of different Asian inspired meals including Malaysian, Vietnamese, Indian.  Small restaurant but really kind owners and menu is expanding soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.
Had the king pao chicken and pad Thai noodles.
It's was very delicious, thought I was actually eating chicken and shrimp.
Very tasty and very filling.
Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I'm his place is amazing! The lunch combo is a great value and the food is fantastic. Love this place and will return often."}
{"text":"Like this place! I love the Hawaiian rice! My wife loves the orange chicken! I like the fact they ask if we're vegan because my wife is but I'm not. Very friendly people!"}
{"text":"I can't even tell you guys how much we love this place. My non-vegan boyfriend is obsessed and we always get to go orders for all of our friends who couldn't make it & we drive all the way from Surprise to come here. If you haven't had it, please do yourself a favor and come here. Im a vegan and their super vegan friendly. I always get the seaweed salad and I love their sesame chicken made with mushrooms. 

Anyways. Come here & your life will change. Thank you Veggie Village for existing. We love you!"}
{"text":"Very good spot downtown if you are looking for a fresh and healthy change from the regular drag of grease and heaviness that has previously run this area. Super glad they opened up! Got the kung pow and it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"4/5 for food and 3/5 for service. Cheap, yummy, and a good deal overall.

Food: We got the Vietnamese Rolls and House Spring Rolls to start with. Both were very good, but I preferred the fresher, lighter Vietnamese rolls to the fried spring rolls, if I had to pick one for next time. The vegetarian ham was interesting, and yummy! For entrees, we got the Xu-yiang Eggplant and the Orange \"Chicken\". The chicken was good, and the addition of orange peel was unexpected and appreciated. The eggplant was amazing, and we loved the sauce it came in. It reminded me of Thai Basil's eggplant. Overall, we'd come back for the food. It was unique, well-seasoned, and set itself apart from the usual Asian fusion.

Service: Ordering was pretty easy, but the waitress was uncommunicative and not at all helpful at communicating to us what the most popular items were. She didn't say anything to us when she brought our food or water, and we didn't get any drink refills while we were there, even though we were the only people in the whole restaurant (it's not that big, and we went for an early weekday dinner, so this wasn't a red flag or anything). 

Overall, very good food and pretty strange service. If you can look past the service, this place is a go-to for vegan and vegetarian at a really good price."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors. I'm in town for work and saw the ratings so I thought I'd give it a try. New to the vegetarian world and this place lives up to its ratings."}
{"text":"It's good vegan food and a nice place to take a family. The staff is friendly and the facilities are clean and comfortable with minimal frills.

I recommend the sweet-and-sour, general tso's and sesame chicken. They're battered and fried mushrooms. The miso soup is also some of the best I've tried."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest.... It is definitely junk food vegan/vegetarian. Fried and heavily sauced. Bit of a disappointment to be honest. Meh."}
{"text":"It has good authentic family food  and prepared with kind and care. It is delicious Veggie foods. Indian style Parota freshly made with Gravy!!. I tried lettuce wrap, oatmeal tofu, Hawaiian fried rice  and couple of them. All are delicious and healthy. Good hospitality and nice family friendly ambiance."}
{"text":"This place has just be remolded. The inside looks new and have a modern vibe to it. Everything from the lighting to the background music gave the place a good atmosphere. 

I never had vegetarian food before. But the food was tasty. I ordered their Yu Xiang Egg-Plant and the Kung Fu Noodle for my father and I. The food was very good. It look good and was season just right. We completely finished everything on our plates. For less than $25 dollars with tips included, this is a very good spot to get your feet wet into vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and loved it!  I used the Happy Cow app to find vegan friendly restaurants.  I had the veggie delight and a vegan pumpkin soup - everything was amazing and full of flavor.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Our dishes were super tasty!! I watched all the dishes come out and I want to try the entire menu. So happy to have a delicious vegan restaurant for our eating pleasure! Will return soon."}
{"text":"I had the Lettuce Wraps and House Spring Rolls. Fast, delicious, vegetarian and good value. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  I am not vegan my daughter is and my hubby and I enjoyed the food. Nice atmosphere and pleasant employee."}
{"text":"We ordered the salt and pepper fried fish. Super awesome! My mom, husband and I loved it. My mom is a vegetarian so she was all raving how delicious this tasted, as good as the real stuff. We also got the eggplant tofu sauté. Flavorful sauce! It's a little pricey but I think that is usually how it goes for vegetarian food. All the fancy prep that goes into it for taste and texture. Will definitely come back for sure to try more!"}
{"text":"I ate there with my friend Mark. I ordered the orange peel chicken. It was pretty good and had an awesome strong orange sauce. Sadly due to my acid reflux I couldn't handle much of it. I'll go again but order something without citrus, spicy or too much salt. I think I'll try the eggplant next time. Oh and the vegan cream cheese wontons were great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I had the Vietnamese Roll, Kung Pao Chicken and General Tso Chicken!  Everything was perfect!  Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"My tastebuds are exploding with all the vegan delights available here! From the lettuce wraps to the salty spicy shrimp to the sesame \"chicken\" and Vietnamese spring rolls!! Why why WHY can't we have this quality and delicious food in Tucson? Well it is worth a trip to Phoenix!
Not to mention the amazing service and the owner is so polite and courteous too. Thank you for reminding me what good food should be eating out as a vegan!"}
{"text":"OMG, try the fried enoki mushrooms!!!!! They are light, crispy and simply perfect.
The vegetable curry and jab chae are also good picks."}
{"text":"When I stopped eating any animal products, I knew I was going to miss the deep fried, savory/sweet wonder that is sweet and sour chicken. Veggie Village's rendition blows me away! The mushrooms are wonderful, and the batter is crunchy and thick. I don't know how they do it, but it's great. Other favorites are the sesame \"chicken\" and hot and sour soup. All vegan, all amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant! The interior is very clean and nicely laid out with comfortable booths as well as regular tables. The décor is simple but very much emphasizes the vegetarian and Asian theme of the establishment. The menu lists a variety of popular favorites one would find in a typical Asian restaurant (sweet-and sour dishes, pad thai and other noodles, etc.) but there is no meat in any of the dishes. 

I tried their spicy salted v (for \"vegetarian\") fish; each piece had a very pleasantly crunchy exterior and the vegetarian \"fish\" within had the flavor of a mild, tender white fish - perhaps not the exact texture of actual fish but it was very tasty nonetheless. To go with that, I ordered a bowl of miso soup, which turned out to be a much bigger bowl than I had expected; I'm used to getting a tiny bowl when I order that soup in other places. The soup was good: just the right degree of saltiness and miso flavor, with decent portions of tofu, seaweed, and mushroom. 

On another occasion I ordered Vietnamese rolls and General Tso Chicken. The rolls were excellent: a refreshing mix of purple basil, lettuce, vegetarian ham, and roasted rice wrapped in the requisite rice paper wrapper and served with a rich, dense peanut sauce. The \"chicken\" in the General Tso dish was actually whole mushrooms dipped in batter, deep-fried, and coated with a sauce that had a good balance of sweet and sour - really flavorful; blanched broccoli came with the \"chicken\" pieces. 

Very pleasant casual atmosphere, phenomenal food at good prices (the dishes are inexpensive - they cost pretty much the same as their counterparts in a regular Chinese restaurant), and great service all make this place a must-try destination. You'll be hooked ... I am, even though I'm not a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that vegan cuisine could be so good. Food was fresh and full of flavor. I will visit again."}
{"text":"I had the V-ginger chicken lunch special FYI this is a vegetarian restaurant so keep that in mind. Food was bland and pretty tasteless, don't get me wrong food is clean and fresh very nice new little place. My wife had the sesame \"chicken\" she didn't like it. I think if you are a serious vegan not many choices this is a place for you."}
{"text":"For starters, a big thanks to Tigra C for putting on a great UYE at this CenPho spot.

Talk about an unexpected find.  About a block east of 12th Street & Northern on the south side of the street you'll see a lengthy old strip center.  I grew up less than 10 minutes drive from this area and must've passed this strip center thousands of times in my life and never once stopped at any of the businesses.  That was of course until about a year ago when I had dinner at Thirteenorth Grille just a few doors down from tonight's big find.  Much like Thirteenorth, Veggie Village doesn't seem like much from the outside.  I've eaten at other vegeterian and vegan spots in town but almost all were stand alone structures that grabbed your attention even before you walked in.  Here however, its whats on the inside that counts.

We arrived not too many days removed from Veggie Village's big expansion.  I say big in jest as the original restaurant only seats maybe 20.  But the newly expanded seating area brings the capacity closer to about 60 now.  Here you order at the front register and grab a seat wherever.  They do take reservations for big groups and were kind enough to reserve a table for us in the newly expanded portion of the restaurant.  The interior is quite nice and was exceptionally clean when we arrived.  Options for chair and booth seating are available throughout and the wood trim on the table and floors is quite beautiful.

After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I noticed they don't have any dessert options.  A little strange as almost every place I've dined at (even vegetarian ones) has dessert options.  No matter.  I made up the difference by having my own app and an entree.  For the app I went with the cream cheese wantons.  I've had the real crab version of these at Asian restaurants my whole life and I can't get enough of them.  And I can happily say the fake crab meat version was equally addictive.  Cream cheese, celery, and mayo with the imitation crab meat with red dipping sauce.  Just like the real thing.  Put simply, I Hoover'd these things (sorry if I weirded out anyone at the table).  For the main course I was craving noodles so I went with the  classic Pad Thai.  Tofu, ground peanut, lettuce, peppers, lime, faux shrimp, bean sprout and faux fish sauce.  The portion was impressive as I was totally full when all was said and done.  It's not the best Pad Thai I've ever had as I've had more flavorful versions elsewhere.  But this one can certainly hold its own.

Total cost for the Wanton app, Pad Thai entree, water and tax came to about $15.  From a value standpoint, the prices here really can't be beat.  Most could come here and be totally full and happy with just $10 or less.  As our Yelp group tonight were true foodies, our whole group pretty much went nuts with almost everyone ordering and sharing several dishes.  I sampled some of the other dishes including the Spiced Salt Fish and Orange Chicken and they were both excellent.  And the staff here was phenomenal as they conversed with us about their recipes and their business frequently during our meal.  Next time I'm here I'll probably opt for one of the chicken or curry menu items.  And again, no meat anywhere on this menu.  So fear not fellow carnivores and take it from me.  The meatless menu at Veggie Village is legit."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and very fast service. Huge portion of soup. Amazing variety of Asian dishes. So glad to have eaten here!"}
{"text":"This was amazing!  I loved every bite of my sweet and sour \"chicken.\"   It tasted perfect, and it's a bit hard to find a vegan version of this dish. 

The service was fast, the waitress friendly, and the owner/cook came to my table to ask me how my food was.  

I highly recommend Veggie Village."}
{"text":"Great place.. good food... For vegetarian Orange chicken (mushrooms)... Great flavor .. i can not wait to try other dishes... for vegetarian's lovers .. great place.. only Gluten.. but we can't ask for perfection... ;-)"}
{"text":"It's a nice place if you like fried food -- kinda salty.  I love it that they use mushrooms in place of meat.  It's a great place to go if you are missing salty and fried asian style fast food"}
{"text":"It's like it's own little world inside. You can see their passion in the restaurant, they're very dedicated to making delicious quality food. WIDE variety to choose from, vegan/vegetarian. The prices are moderate, definitely $-$$ (for more than one person) but they are wonderful, friendly people. Even if I wasn't vegan, I'd still come here instead of some other place like Panda Express. I'm HOOKED."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the reviews for this place and decided to stop in. Although it wasn't the best vegan place we've been to, it was still really good and a great price. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good vegan that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Veggie Village is relatively new to our neighborhood and I already have their number saved in my phone contacts. Their food is delicious, while feeling light and healthy. Often, I'll order a few sides for some variety. Pot stickers, roti prata, springs rolls- it's all good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and chose the lettuce wraps.  Not a 5, because all I had was the lettuce wraps, but they were were quite tasty, couldn't tell it wasn't meat, but that is the point.  I will come back and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Came in with 2 friends for dinner. It was our first time here. My two companions got the orange chicken (mock meat), and I got the sesame chicken (mushrooms). Also got edamame, and iced teas. This place is AMAZING. I keep finding myself crave those sesame mushrooms. My friends also loved their meal. The service is great, food is fresh and yummy, and the atmosphere is awesome. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We are vegan and they have made a night out to dinner easy and delish!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something healthy when I landed in Phoenix and rented a car just to show how serious my quest was, as I didn't want to default automatically to the hotel restaurant and find an inadvertent wad of French fries in my mouth. Yeah, like those fries would have gotten in my mouth without my full consent. I just happened upon this sparsely decorated eatery on the Yelp app and noticed a lot of approving reviews from what looked like the skinnier Yelpers in the Valley. I don't know Phoenix at all but found myself in what they call the North-Central area of town and there it was in a quiet strip mall.

Steamed chicken aficionado that I am, the funny thing was that I had been wanting Hainan chicken which would have put my vegetarian aspirations on the back burner. I have a thing for steamed poultry I can't quite explain except I must be part Singaporean or channeling someone's grandmother up the Yangtze River. As fate would have it, this place was serving as its daily special the $9.95 Mock Hainan Chicken Rice. Such joyous rapture I felt for the prospect of such a culinary creation that I didn't hesitate to order it. It was surprisingly satisfying with the faux-poultry pinch-hitting quite nicely with the cucumber slices, dipping sauces, and infused rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcE75g).

I also tried the delicious $5.95 Lettuce Wraps, which mixed together sauteed and finely chopped vegan 'meat', mushrooms, water chestnuts, shredded carrot, cilantro leaves, and fried rice noodles into an appetizing filling for the generously sized iceberg lettuce leaves (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcUwXJ). In this case, it was truly indistinguishable from its carnivorous counterpart. Other dishes looked quite tempting as they passed by my table like the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Rainbow Salad. Given what a modest operation it appears to be, I have to say this was a great veggie find in Phoenix and well worth finding on your GPS.

FOOD - 5 stars...great execution of vegan dishes you would not suspect would be so tasty
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean and modest-looking in its decor
SERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly and helpful in explaining the genesis of their dishes
TOTAL - 5 stars...nice to find a healthy dining experience as good as this that won't empty your wallet"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything on the menu can be veganized! And everything is vegetarian. And I think they've made improvements over time, their food has gotten better and it's sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"The veggie scene in AZ is finally growing, with VV as the latest addition. As with many veg places it has \"Asian\" food, with a few hints on Indian. The menu is actually influenced by Singapore.

We started the meal with the letuce wraps. I really liked the texture contrast from the \"meat\" with the fried noodle bits.

For the main items we had general tso mushrooms. They are basically the best fried mushrooms you will ever have with a bit of sauce and some peppers and rice. The great chillie oil they have made it even better. Be sure to eat this ASAP before the sauce can make the breading soggy.

The other dish was a rice noodle dish, other than the fun of veggie shrimp it was nothing too special other than it made a great vehicle for the chillie oil. 

I must go back and try more."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner and so I have been here a few times when I didn't feel like cooking. The egg rolls were tasty, the noodles flavorful and I loved the vegan ham. The burger was just okay, but the noodle entrees I would try more of. Great vegetarian/vegan place to try out !"}
{"text":"Amazing! The inside looks great and the people working there are super nice. I'm not vegetarian, but really enjoyed the salted vegetarian 'fish'. I will definitely go back soon. I also tried the sweet & sour 'chicken', my only recommendation is that it would be nice if it could be more crispy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! We were 5 of us and everything we ordered was delicious. The best though has to be the Paratha!!. Only drawback, they are lacking in dessert department."}
{"text":"This was excellent.  Though I've only been here once, everything about it was exceptional.  Vegetarian/vegan or not, this is a tasty option (none of us in my party were).  Basically it's like a Thai restaurant that does only vegetarian and vegan meals.

The service was very friendly from beginning to end.  Everything came out quickly.  I had a tofu curry soup which was excellent.  There was some kind of crispy layered tofu in it that was really good.  Their fried tofu satay was really great; everyone had that and loved it.  The cream cheese puffs (vegetarian crab puffs) were also very good, and different from most others.  Their shell is a bit thicker and very crispy, with a very good flavor.

When the cook heard that I like extra spicy, they made up a special sauce that was a very nice addition to my curry.  Also, the portions on everything were quite huge.  

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food.  I did not see fake food on the menu... For the chicken dishes, they use whole mushrooms that are coated in a batter and lightly fried.  The side veggies appeared to be steamed.  Great flavors and nice service!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was working in the area and decided to try this restaurant out for lunch. I ended up ordering the Hawaiian Fried Rice. It came with white rice, mixed veggies, pineapple and imitation pork. The portion size was pretty good too. Maybe not $9 worth but I don't mind paying more for healthier food options. 

It was good but kind of bland. I feel like it was missing a sauce or something. I ordered to go and forgot to ask for soy sauce or like a sweet and sour and there was none in the bag so I ended up having the rice straight up. 

I walked in during lunch and ordered to go and the process was quick and easy. Took 5 min max to receive my order after placing it. Restaurant was small but decorated nice. Staff was friendly and parking is plentiful and free. 

Maybe next time I'll try something different."}
{"text":"My son like the Kung Pao chicken so much, he ordered a second dish after we had finished the meal. We also enjoyed the Hawaiian fried rice, veggie delight, and wide noodles with vegetables. The spring rolls were a great appetizer as well. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Overall the experience was outstanding and we will be back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! Delicious food! Great prices! Clean and simple atmosphere with attentive and friendly staff. Will be making this a regular dinner destination l."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food!!! Order here about twice a week!!! Try there orange chicken, kung pow chicken, and there pad Thai"}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions, and fast service--what's not to Love?!?

The only thing that's less than perfect is that some of their menu choices are only vegetarian (instead of vegan), and I don't think they were labeled as such on the menu?  That's important as many believe that dairy products are evil.  Raping cows, to make them pregnant, to then steal their babies (for veal), and then to steal their milk for us, is a gross moral perversion.  So being vegan is important and mixing the menu options with non-vegan items should be corrected soon.

Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and great service -- the spiced salt fish was sooo tasty!  I really enjoy their variety of faux meat dishes.  Can't wait to come back here and try something else!"}
{"text":"Great \"new\" find for vegans and those who are okay without animal based protein. Excellent service and food presentation.  Wide assortment with options for all."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite vegan place. I like ginger chicken with fried rice and I tried almost every time I came here. I highly recommend this place if you are vegan."}
{"text":"Good food, rather get food to go, staff can be distracted a lot, for example, not taking water to our table or taking too long to give us the bill. Also took some friends to eat one day at 3 pm in summer and it was so hot! I don't know if the ac was working or not they didn't seem to care, that's why I usually order to go as their food is bomb.com"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch right after it opened.  Love the cleanliness and friendly family who operate the restaurant.  Great food for vegans and vegetarians alike and anyone else who loves good food!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Its been atleast a year since I've been here...... They opened it up so more seating..... They have added some special diahes for friday and sunday...... I am soooo happy to be back. The staff is the same sweet happy people...... I love thia place!!!"}
{"text":"Would rate 3.5*s.

Ordered 
orange chicken - Never tasted chicken so, I call it well tried imitation. Quantity was decent for the price. Not very impressive taste though.

Stic Potter - just fried dumplings with veggies stuffed in. Decent taste and quantity for the price.

Best of all  mint cucumber lemonade. I totally recommend this beverage."}
{"text":"Wow - this place has it all and taste service and VEGAN - love it I wished I lived around here . I had the vegan wantons and a veggi bowl and some Bo ass tea"}
{"text":"I had vegan Vietnamese rolls, Singapore noodles and roti prata, everything was so fresh and delicious !!! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Veggie Village today to try them out. The inside is nicely remodeled. The restaurant is very clean, contemporary, casual and inviting, with comfortable booths.

We got their bento box lunch specials, which are just $8. The specials come jam-packed with an entree, rice, a fried springroll, salad and soup! Super combo ftw! Everything on the menu is vegan with the exception of the cream cheese wontons. 

We opted for the Tom Yam fish and the sesame v chicken. Tom Yam fish was spicy and very flavorful. 

The v chicken were tasty and unique! They use mushrooms battered and fried for the sesame \"chicken\". Really enjoyed them! The sesame sauce was thick & sweet, as is traditional for that sauce. I'd probably get the sauce on the side next time just so that it's not so overwhelming, but that's the case for just about any sesame or orange sauce style dish.

They also have other vegan chicken that use a more traditional soy-chicken style and some other mock meats. Looking forward to trying out the other items on the menu!

Suggestions for the owner:
Use vegan cream cheese in your wontons to go 100% vegan!
Serve the soup a bit hotter (temperature).
Take the corn off the cob in the soup.
Offer vegan desserts!"}
{"text":"The fucking wizards in the kitchen! And there making the best damn vegetarian Asian food in the whole damn universe. Pot stickers.. FIRE. Lo Mein noodles.. FIRE. The Singapore fried rice noodles transcended my taste buds into a whole new realm of existence of flavors."}
{"text":"I spent a year outside the USA and most of it was in Asia. This is the only place I've been to in the states that actually tastes like I'm in Asia. The quality of the ingredients are outstanding and the taste is spectacular. I've ordered 10 things on the menu in my visits here and every item is a 10 out of 10! But my most favorite thing on the menu is the Mutton Curry. Vegetarian and meat eaters here all the time and love this place. You have to come check it out :-)"}
{"text":"Best veggie cuisine I've had, and I love that it's a combination of my two favorites - Thai and Vietnamese. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian but I find this type of food very delicious and satisfying, and I love that I'm getting in my days nutrition with their colorful veg and herbs! Even meat lovers have told me they enjoyed the food from this place. 

Highly recommend the satay tofu, Vietnamese rolls and rainbow salad with sesame dressing. The village fried rice is great too. I want to keep trying more things!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Waitress was very conscientious to ask whether each person was vegan or vegetarian so that they got what they wanted. Very clean. Great staff. I had the vegetable curry and am just in heaven."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!!! Every single thing I've had is amazing and fresh. The flavors that come out in their dishes are truly unmatched at any vegetarian/vegan restaurant. My mother-in-law who is the furthest from vegan as anyone can get (she is an avid Atkins fan) loved the leftovers I brought her to try of the Sesame \"Chicken\". This doesn't feel like a restaurant trying to make \"regular\" dishes vegan, it is in a category of its own and I will continue to be a regular here. Love it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegetarian food of all time!! Cream cheese wontons and spiced salt fish with extra ginger sauce on the side is a must!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place, as they moved to the neighborhood not too long ago.  They remodeled what used to be a donut shop, and did a marvelous job I must say.  They redid the floors in bamboo tiles, added nice light fixtures, painted, and added comfy booths.  The atmosphere is very cozy and comforting.  The staff greeted me immediately and were knowledgeable about their menu.  I ordered the potstickers which were pan-fried, so delicious, and came with a tasty dipping sauce.  I also ordered the General Tso's chicken which is made with mushroom and had bell pepper and broccoli smothered in sauce.  Everything was excellent and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good variety, fresh ingredients and fast service. Excellent selection. Will come again!"}
{"text":"It was really good. The portion sizes can be a bit bigger though. At least for the Kung Pao. Overall good experience. Decent food. Very friendly staff and don't take forever to serve like other places."}
{"text":"I got the Vietnamese Spring Rolls and edamame for dinner and it was perfect and filling! The peanut sauce was sooo yummy!! It totaled up to be very cheap (I think $7) and I ordered for pick up. I left my house about 8 min after I called and when I got there it was ready. I'm so happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on Yelp, honestly didn't know what to expect but the food was awesome so delicious I got Vietnamese spring rolls and general tso's \"chicken\" with white rice (mushrooms included). The only thing I didn't like so much was I felt rushed by the staff a little but overall I would 100% come back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always excited to see more vegetarian/vegan places around the valley. Great service and food, beautifully remodeled!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that new vegan and vegetarian restaurants are appearing in greater Phoenix area! Veggie Village serves nicely prepared and presented Asian fusion, Asian, and some novel entrees and appetizers. Spices, herbs and (amount of) salt are well-balanced. Portion sizes are somewhat generous (yet, I fail to have leftovers). Interesting and delicious variety of \"meat\" substitutes are available; but, dishes that use mushrooms as v-chicken are definitely recommended. The venue is modest from outside, but has a positive energy and pleasant atmosphere on the inside. This restaurant is definitely on our regular-stop list!"}
{"text":"Vegan Singapore Rice Noodles is delicious and wouldn't even know the cream cheese and crab wontons are vegan. Nice job!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I checked out this fairly new restaurant for lunch today. I'm vegan and she is not. We both ordered lunch combos which included: house spring roll, choice of soup, a small salad, your choice of vegan chicken, vegan curry, vegan chicken, vegan fish, or vegetable entree.  (lots to choose from!. We both agreed the food was excellent! Nicely decorated, clean and airy. Family owned and operated and conveniently located in central Phoenix with lots of parking. I will definitely be back to eat here with another friend we my husband! ;-)"}
{"text":"First night of what should be a monthly Vegan dinner club UYE. This was about the first or second week after their expansion. Based on the customers on a week night It was a good thing they added the extra seating. Everybody working there was nice to deal with. The people taking orders at the counter had answers to all the dietary questions for Vegetarian and Vegan. The food was very tasty and priced well."}
{"text":"Great food, every menu option can be made vegan and lovely people providing the service. We love coming here. It is quick, affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful gem of a restaurant in central phoenix! I was so pleased with everything ordered, and the service was personable and friendly. The Market Salad was phenomenal, I can't stop thinking about it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Some of my family members are vegan and sometimes that kind of food is not so good. And then there's Veggie Village with excellent vegetarian and vegan food. Everything I've tried is great and very reasonably priced. I was happy to see they recently expanded into the suite next door."}
{"text":"Many choices--basically a vegan Chinese restaurant. Very friendly staff. The salad was very good. Suggest they don't serve soup in bento box and serve on the side. In place in box, serve dumplings or steamed veggies or fresh spring roll. Suggest improving taste/flavor and adding more veggies. Go or try to increase more vegetarian options in the Valley. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Found yet another gem! It's pretty far from me but after seeing all the great pictures and 5 star review I HAD to come check it out! You don't expect it to be a small establishment so when you walk in its kind of a surprise, but don't let the size fool you!

It is very nice and clean on the inside and I love the paragraph on the wall to remind veg heads why they live the lifestyle they do and to educate meat eaters who don't understand! I went around lunch time so it was a few groups of people already inside eating. The lady who took my order was very friendly and she helped me decide if I should go for the Spiced Salt Fish bento box or just get the entree by itself. She educated me on what I would get on either decision and so I went with the bento box because it's a dollar less and you get more things with it!

I dined in and sat down and she brought me a water without me even asking, very good customer service in my opinion because who doesn't like water (if you don't you're weird!)? It only took about 5 minutes for my food to be ready and put on my table. I was a little skeptical with the soup and the egg roll that I got because I've never been fond of egg rolls, but the lady promised the soup was really good! The mock fish was soooo good it's unreal! I don't necessarily like spicy foods but I was eating everything even the jalapenos (I know, not really spicy at all)! And the egg roll and soup were tasty as well!

Overall I had a great experience with this place and will definitely take the trip from Tempe to North Phoenix again just to eat there. I would love to try something else from the menu but what I had was so good I feel like I won't want to try anything else! Now I know why this place has a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Local place for us and I saw the great reviews on Yelp, so wanted to try it out. Nice, clean place. We're not vegetarian or vegan, but trying to eat healthier.  Everything here looked healthy.  We had the vegetable pot stickers, pad thai, kung pao chicken, and 2 teas. First of all, very inexpensive at $20. Food came out quickly and was very tasty. We had enough for leftovers. Service was awesome too! Definitely a great option when we want healthy and Asian, which is often."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant! Super tasty and very fresh ingredients. I had Kung Pao chick'n, and it was great!"}
{"text":"Just visited again for the third time. I just can't get over how great the food is here. We tried the Hot & Sour soup and the Singapore Fried Rice Noodle dish. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Food is very good!! Even my picky children enjoyed the delicious food.  Place is very nice and clean and the service was great!! So glad they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have now been to this restaurant two times.  I am addicted to the veggie curry.  My family loves the \"chicken\" burger.  The place is spotless.  The food is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here every Friday evening. We have no problem making the trip all the way from Ahwatukee... it's one of the top vegetarian spots in town. Service is amazing. The Salt and Pepper \"shrimp\" will blow your minds. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good ambience, really good vegan/vegetarian food. We tried roti prata, kung Pao chicken , Tom yum fried rice, potstickers and pad thai. Kung Pao was outstanding. All dishes were yum and this was shared with 4 people. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be good.....I love vegetarian places. But the food we ordered was greasy and/or tasted fake or \"off\" somehow. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the flavors kind of tasted like they just bought off the rack spice packets at the market and used those instead of fresh ingredients. We aren't going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Veggie Village tonight for the second time and ordered some appetizers and an entree. We got the cream cheese wontons, lettuce wraps and orange chicken. We had the lettuce wraps the first time we went and really liked them but also wanted to try some new things. When we ordered we made sure to say vegan multiple times because they have a vegetarian and vegan option for every menu item so If you are vegan be cautious of that when ordering. I took a bite of the wontons and was skeptical, but I haven't had cream cheese in almost 6 years so I was unsure of what I was tasting. I told my boyfriend to try them and he could tell something was weird. He went up to the counter and asked them again to make sure the won tons were vegan and the two women said yes. A few moments later the cook was at our table telling us they're vegetarian not vegan. She asked if we wanted her to make us the vegan won tons but we were both done eating at that point. All of the employees apologized multiple times and took care of our bill which was really nice but unfortunately we both feel sick and bummed, to say the least. It's really unfortunate that they didn't take us seriously when we specifically ordered vegan everything. The cook told us that our server didn't specify that on our order. It's safe to say we won't be returning to Veggie Village."}
{"text":"Had the lettuce wrap and burger. They were both cooked very well. I will definitely be going back here to try other things. The service was nice, and they asked if I was vegetarian or vegan? Thats probably because not everything is vegan."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I am in love! Such delicious vegan food, and it is so nice inside. Nice seating and tables, great service, and the food is made fresh and it is so good! We ordered rolls for appetizers, and two noodle dishes. Definitely coming back and making this place a regular stop. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Veggie Village reminds me of some of the traditional Chinese vegetarian restaurants I've been to in Hong Kong. They use interesting mock meats and seafood - some that are almost too close to real (to the point that there have been online debates on if the mutton is really vegan - hashtag \"dramamutton\"). They also use a lot of mushrooms, but no onion or garlic. It's probably not the first vegan/vegetarian restaurant I'd take people to in town if they wanted to try vegan food. I've overheard too many diners being confused about what they were eating. But for those initiated into the world of mock meats, it's a real treat!
The restaurant is 100% vegetarian, and everything can be made vegan. Just make sure you say which way you want it when you order. There are a wide variety of starters like you would find at any Asian restaurant. Our favorites are the lettuce wraps and dumplings. The miso soup is also very good. For entrees, we've enjoyed the Kung Pao, General Tso and Sesame \"Chicken.\" You can get any of the \"chicken\" dishes with mock chicken or fried mushroom. We also liked the Village Tofu. My only recommendation on the food is that they add more vegetable-focused dishes. And less mushroom (I hate mushrooms, so it limits what I can order here).
The service is always friendly, but can get a little slow if they're busy. There's usually only one or two people serving."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times and really love their food. The hot and sour soup is EXCELLENT. The mutton curry dish is also very good. Every other dish has been quite tasty. They are expanding their seating area into a neighboring space. Great food, like $8-10 a plate."}
{"text":"The night we went, there was a vegan/vegetarian meet-up - and we got there right after they had all ordered.  We understood that the service would be slow because of the group - the owners gave us free edamame for the wait, which was nice.  Its great to see a vegan/vegetarian restaurant packed!

The food was really good - I liked that most of the entrees did not feature fake meats, but used mushrooms in place of the meat.  We ordered the miso soup - one is enough to share, the fried wontons, tom yam fish and the tom yam fried rice - all very good.

One area of confusion - we asked what was not vegan on the menu and was told the burger and one of the soups.  We had the fried wontons, then read a review on here that said they were not vegan.   I will be back to this restaurant, there are so many options I would like to try, but may avoid the wontons until I know for sure."}
{"text":"Really good vegan options. Hot and sour soup is amazing! Affordable prices. Can dine in or order to go."}
{"text":"Apprehensive at first when hearing where I was going for lunch but boy did that change when I ordered the vegan sesame chicken. Never have I tasted mushrooms this good! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service was great! The food was hot and crispy! And let's not forget, delicious! I had the General Tso with the vegan chicken"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! Enjoyed an amazing Vegan dinner with my sissy.
 Vietnamese Vegan Tofu Roll
Salt n Pepper Calamari (made with mushrooms)
Tom Yam Fish (soy wrapped in seaweed)
1st time trying it and definitely going back!"}
{"text":"First time customer here but will be continued as a regular customer. We all love the food here, services and the cleanness. Never expect the vegetarian food can be so delicious. We would highly recommend if anyone looking for vegetarian Chinese food."}
{"text":"Legit Delish. We had the pad thai, the dumplings, salad, and miso soup. Get the dumplings. They are little pillows of yummy, juicy vegetables. The wonderful woman who works here remembered my family and surprised us all by bringing out a water container my son had left the last time we visited two months ago! If I lived in Arizona I would be a regular here. Everything was so good and I can't resist supporting smaller businesses with nice owners."}
{"text":"Yum! A friend came in town to visit and she wanted to try this place, since she's vegetarian. It's a cozy spot located off of Northern, not too far from the 51. I scoped out their menu before I came to familiarize myself and to make my decision easier.

I arrived early and got water as I waited for my friends. When got settled and were ready to order, we went to the front and did that. I ordered the hot and sour soup and Kung pao chicken with white rice. The soup was delicious and came out in a big bowl. I was excited for it because the soup I used to order from other restaurants had chicken in it and this was the veggie version. Loved the tofu and broth, I finished it at the restaurant so I wouldn't have to take it home. Also because it was good.

My entree was really good, similar to the real dish I've had in the past. The flavors worked well together and the faux chicken was spot on. It wasn't very spicy so I'll say that could be improved, but I also didn't eat the chili peppers (too dry). My friend ordered the salted fish which I've seen rave reviews about, and it tasted just like fish. My friend enjoyed it. 

I'd love to come back and try some other menu items! Affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"A really great vegetarian/vegan restaurant! Love love coming here. Appetizers I've had the potstickers which were alright, but I really love the roti and curry. Their orange chicken is delicious as is their sweet and sour. And their noodle dishes are very yummy as well. Definitely recommend this joint! Meat lovers will enjoy too."}
{"text":"Their menu says, \"Eat Healthy, Be Happy,\" but we're happy even if we don't eat healthy here. 

All portion sizes are big and the food is cooked and flavored well and presented nicely. The Hot and Sour soup is thick and loaded with veggies and v-meat and is filling so it's more of a meal than a side. The Vegetable Curry, Kung Pao Chicken, and Kung Fu Noodle are all good, but they are heavy. The Kung Fu Noodle was so greasy I dumped it in a metal strainer and rinsed it with hot water - it was still good. Their v-meat is a lot like what Loving Hut uses and is a little too close to the real thing for some people so if you don't like shrimp, don't get their v-shrimp. There are a ton of options so as we eat our way through their menu I will update my review.

I appreciate that they confirm (they actually ask) if your order is vegan versus vegetarian. Almost everything can be made vegan, but they do use dairy in some things and need to substitute nut milk."}
{"text":"Very delicious restaurant! Ordered the lemongrass fish, general tso, and spicy noodles! Would definitely go again. Flavorful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Count me amongst the converted. When I saw the 5 star rating I too was skeptical, even cynical. Well this evening I had a  Mutton Curry conversion to the growing mass of adoring fans. The food is outstanding and I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dinner! We just got into Phoenix and I was craving some healthy food. Saw the great reviews on Yelp and asked our Lyft driver to take us to Veggie Village. It's located in an unassuming strip mall and the prices are super super reasonable especially since they give you huge portions. People that work here are so nice. I felt a really great welcome to Phoenix. 
I wish they had a location in Oakland, California!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I don't think I have ever tasted vegan food as good as this. Thank you guys for being so close to where I was staying at, You saved me from eating unhealthy fast food."}
{"text":"I was very hungry. The vegetarian restaurant, Chennai Chettinad was closed after lunch time. I searched in Yelp and landed at this place after a long drive. The drive was really worth it  because it was a  very good place and offered very good tasty food. Staff were very courteous. I will visit this place again. It is a heaven for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Update:  we wanted to go back to this place for dinner the night before we flew home.  Sadly, Veggie Village is CLOSED SATURDAYS.  Vegetarians/Vegans need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Just tried this vegatarian restaurant for the first time and absolutely loved it! Customer service was very friendly and attentive. The food has so much flavor, it is mouth watering even thinking about it. So glad we found this gem, will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Yey! I found a new vegetarian gem in the valley. I used to live in this area. Too bad I moved! Highly recommended especially for lunch!If you have limited time, you will find the service to be quick and efficient. The vegan and vegetarian choices are good and well priced. Great lunch special which comes with egg roll, soup, salad, rice, and entree.   I got the alternative fish (tofu) filled with flavorful sauces, and it was very tasty,"}
{"text":"Really great place to come, so many vegan options for me and my girlfriend. I had the sesame soy chicken and i felt as though i was in heaven. We will definitely be coming back for some more and I'll have to try another of the many options."}
{"text":"Good Choice for Lunch

Most of the menu options are meat-free, with about one half dozen meat dishes on the last page.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals, the service was good, and the prices were reasonable.  However, there is really nothing here that makes it a five-star experience."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Veggie Village. The food was fresh and delicious! Serving sizes were ample and the menu is extensive. The Tom Yam Fish was a sour and spicy treat! If I had to make one complaint, it would be that everything is not vegan, but the server was very helpful in identifying what was and wasn't. When visiting the area again, I would love to visit and try more of the delicious sounding menu options."}
{"text":"Never been here before but saw it was opening up awhile back. Checked out the menu and went here IMMEDIATELY. I am tired of wasting my money on NON-Vegan/Vegetarian friendly restaurants that don't understand the movement/cause of what it means to eat healthy and cruelty free but I digress. 

Veggie Village's food was amazing!!. I brought my carnivore friend and he said he was definitely coming back. 

The food:
Appetizer was the Hakka Tofu which came out differently (visually) than I had seen from other reviews but was still amazing. Fried tofu with house sauce and slices of carrot and cucumber was good and tasted very fresh. 

I ordered the KUNG PAO CHICKEN (v) with the mock chicken, I believe you can also do breaded mushroom as an alternative. White or Brown rice was included but I opted for the upgrade to fried rice for an extra $1.50. 
It looked great visually and came out super hot. The taste was fresh and snap peas were not soggy or overcooked. The portion was enough for me (200lbs and can eat a bunch) big rectangle plate with rice served in an one cup portion bowl.  The fried rice was also good and also hot. They don't use egg and fried rice was not overly salty or oily. 

My meat eating friend ordered the aGeneral Tso Chicken which was really breaded mushrooms. I tried a couple and they were also great. Breading was crunchy and just right, sauces were not overly salted and balanced. He also got the fried rice. 

After we enjoyed and devoured our meals and finished the appetizer we sat back and did not feel heavy like other Asian style food restaurants. 

Definitely recommended for others looking for a healthy cruelty free place.   Pics below"}
{"text":"If you are contemplating... just go! The only problem will be... you will want to come back every night to try all the food!!! Whenever I am in town for work I eat here, it's clean, everyone is friendly, and the food is like nothing I've had before. Please consider branching out into Temecula California :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for lunch here when we were in Phoenix.   Everything was delicious, the service was very good, and the restaurant was super clean!  We will definitely be back when we are in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This place was really delicious! The service was good and fast. Good option for those who don't eat too much meat or who are vegetarians"}
{"text":"this is a jewel founded in the desert!!!

if you like vegan food you will love vegan food after your first visit.
than you,lord for this blessing.
everything we order was super delicious.
i highly recommend it to everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Northern this little neighborhood spot is worth checking out.. cute modern interior.. can accommodate small groups.. we ordered and food came out quickly.

Plenty of options.. something for everyone.. we started with the fried enoki mushroom ($5.95.. perfectly fried) such a pretty dish.. very good. I had the pad Thai with faux shrimp and tofu ($8.95) big enough to share.. flavors were very good. 

My bf had the village fried rice ($7.95) it was good, kind of a smoky dish. And the General Tso was fried mushroom, bell peppers and broccoli with brown rice on the side.. the fried mushroom is amazing ($8.95)!! You don't miss the meat in this dish.. if you love mushroom you'll love this .. 

We will definitely be back to try some of the other options. Prices are very reasonable for fresh quality food."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch. The quality of the food is top notch. Many of the entrees included fried mushrooms as the main course. These were crazy good. Had the general tso and sweet and sour both with fried mushrooms in light sauce. Came with homemade soups, noodles that were amazing, had some kind of smoky flavor to them. I am not a vegan or vegetarian nor do u need to be to eat here. Way better and more reasonable than loving hut. Better than most other Asian restaurants in the area as well."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place and I'm not even vegan or vegetarian! I just love a meatless meal every once in a while. I live right around the corner and decided to try it out since it has raving reviews. I totally understand why! The place is super clean and tidy, definitely something I appreciate and something that is hard to find. I ordered the pad Thai, my mother in law ordered the v-chicken curry. Both dishes were AMAZING - the flavor, heat, everything was perfect. Super friendly staff too! I can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Wow! This is in my neighborhood?! Wow! The food is so good! Just got the vegetable lamb curry and the vegetable sesame chicken... Amazing! Can't wait to dive in more to this place.  We will surely be regulars!"}
{"text":"Omg! I can't put into words how delicious.. No. Scrumptious this food is. We had Sesame Chx, Orange Chx, veggie curry, and pad Thai. Oh, and two apps, chix lettuce wraps and potstickers. I know, we were pigs! It was so good. My fave was the sesame chx. You must try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Veggie Village is so appetizing, it's got my ignorant, proudly carnivorous associates wanting to give it a try.

Like seriously, just bait someone into saying veg food is stupid, then show them my photo. They'll feel stupid because this is amazing. 

Some dishes here try to vaguely imitate meat. My sesame \"chicken\" was surprisingly made with lightly fried mushrooms as opposed to some soy substitute. I also sampled some grilled tofu with a rich, spicy peanut sauce that I'd love to have over some brown rice and vegetables sometime. 

My only complaint is I think they could survive toning it down a bit on the salt. It's definitely overboard and I would have enjoyed my meal just as much had it contained less. I subtract no stars, as I was practically licking my plate! 

Overall, this menu is expansive without sacrificing quality, and surprisingly affordable and accessible. If you're in central Phoenix already, most definitely consider going a bit far up north to check out what Veggie Village has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I tried the General Tso's Chicken on my first visit and I must say it was some of the best I've had. The food quality is great the staff is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"YUM! So far I have only had the \"sesame chicken\" but it was delicious! Loved it and appreciated that they don't charge extra for brown rice like most places do.  I will be back! The place looks nice too."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! The food is delicious. The server was really nice. The price is awesome for the quantity of food you receive. The miso soup is great and huge and I totally recommend it!! I also ordered a sea food dish (I can't remember what it was called) which was really good!! 
I will definitely return and I recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is seriously such a delicious place to eat. Everyone should eat here. Don't let the strip mall location fool you this place is wonderful. The restaurant is clean the staff is very friendly and the food is always hot and delicious. Many great choices for vegetarians and vegans alike and would also be great for those nonveg as well. Dont hesitate to stop in!!"}
{"text":"First time here, with my friend who is vegan.  I'm not vegan, but am open to trying new things.

She had yellow curry, I had a noodle dish, and asked for it to be spicier.  We ordered a vegetable soup, to split.

Perfect portions, and we left full.  Our entrees were very reasonable, at $8.95.  Soup was $2.95.

Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My whole family is vegetarian. They're from SF where veg food is pretty much everywhere and totally accessible. This is the first and only place so far since moving to Arizona have I ever tried and said to myself \"Geez, I need to bring my mom and dad here when they come to visit.\" 

We had the potstickers, hot and sour soup, General Tso's Chicken, and the pad thai. It was definitely way too much food for two, but we were happy with our leftovers! Everything was delicious! It took a few tries with the mushroom \"meat\" but I really began to enjoy it. Amazing what they can do with mushrooms!! And that's coming from someone that doesn't really like mushrooms to begin with!! 

There's so many other things that we'd love to try on the menu. I really can't wait for return to this place!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, this place blows me away!  I think this is one of the best restaurants for the money in Phoenix, and I'm not even a vegetarian!  The place unfortunately has zero curb appeal from the outside, but don't let that fool you.  The asian-inspired dishes here are wonderful, and the environment is friendly, clean and comfortable.  I highly recommend the fried enoki mushroom appetizer and the faux mutton stew, but in my experience you can't go wrong here no matter what you order.  Even the side of brown rice they served on my last visit tasted unusually flavorful.  Whoever owns this place really knows what they're doing.  Good vegetarian food requires alot of creativity, and this place has it nailed!"}
{"text":"Tonight the Jolly Diners returned to Veggie Village. We had such a good experience the last time we dined here, that we decided to try it again. My mom had the sweet and sour V chicken with a side of fried rice, and my sister and I both had orange V chicken on top of flat noodles(our own creation). For appetizers we enjoyed spring rolls and pot stickers. Everything here is vegan, everything is delicious, there's no worries about what you're eating. Veggie Village is a wonderful place to have a well prepared, well presented, and well served meal at a very reasonable price. I would recommend it to anyone, and the Jolly Diners once again give Veggie Village 5 out of 5 stars. We hope you enjoy it as well.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the potsticker (8) total, my 4 year old at 7 of them. We had the Hawaiian Fried Rice, it was good but next time I'll order it with more pineapple & veggies.  The Orange Peel Chicken was yummy! I Ice Kacang I didn't like at all. I guess my taste buds were expecting something like Ché. 
Anyway, I WILL be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great staff. Love everything about this place. 
This is a great addition to the area specifically that plaza is becoming a culinary force in North Central Phoenix

Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian you should check this place out"}
{"text":"Had so much fun trying this place since I am a dedicated \"meat-a-vore\" but one with an open mind to try different cuisines/foods out. I've only had vegan food once, and it was kind of disastrous [if you play Cards Against Humanity, its the epitomy of #DisappointingSalad]. So I came into Veggie Village with a bit of timidity. Tigra calmed that down telling me how awesome this place is... and she was right!

Totally non-discrep great find in north Phoenix that I probably would've passed a million times if I lived in the area. When I dined they were just a few days past expansion [holy moly was their original spot TINY!]. The menu is just long and expansive with lots of options... some of which weren't [yet] on the menu. The manager let us/Tigra [mostly hah!] test a few new items out and asked for our thoughts on the combos. 

I enjoyed sharing some bites around with my fellow dining companions, come to find out I really like sesame mushrooms [\"chicken\"] and their version of shrimp with my Pad Thai! I'm kind of timid with spice so luckily for me the Pad Thai wasn't crazy spicy. The sauce was a little salty for me, but really flavorful otherwise. Their Salt Fish was crazy good too - something that really surprised me!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food!!! Pot stickers are the chain! Lemonade with mint another winner.  Great price and service."}
{"text":"This place has great vegetarian lunch options.  Service is friendly and effiecient.  Prices are fair.  The kung pao is very tasty...  You won't even know that its meat free.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was searching for vegan restaurants and found Veggie Village.  I'm so glad they are here making delicious vegan and vegetarian dishes. My husband and I shared Kung pao, Singapore noodles, lettuce wraps.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I can hardly wait for the next visit on a date night.   Oh we also had the shaved ice... yummy!  Go try I know you will love this place."}
{"text":"My daughter took me there for lunch. It's a very nice quiet place. Food is delicious and prices very affordable. I would expect it to be more pricey considering it's a vegan/ healthy food restaurant. 
I don't remember how real shrimp taste ( have a shellfish allergy) but being able to eat \"shrimps\" it was amazing, texture is perfect. I would definitely go back ,I liked it more than regular Chinese food. And now we have place on my side of town to go for food with my daughter, who is fully vegan."}
{"text":"We have come here once a week. Everything is delicious.  Not a single entree has ever disappointed. We try something different each time."}
{"text":"Customer service for our gluten allergy and vegan diet were unmatched.  The employees made sure everything we ate was safe.  Super delicious specialty drinks.  The inside is clean and uncluttered.  The restaurant seemed like a well oiled machine.  The food came out quickly and was very fresh. 
-smx2"}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't get enough of their burger, is my favorite thing on the menu. The spring rolls are pretty bomb as well! I've recently tried their Korean Japchae noodles they're so goood! Going to keep trying different items from the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Love the Food here ! Had the pineapple fried rice and they made sure it was Gluten free also !   

  We loved it and we will return :)"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!!  Nice, simple, good tasting food at a reasonable price.  This isn't a fancy place but it is great value!  I will go back next time in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the 2nd time & enjoyed our meal. I had vegan Kung Pao chicken which was awesome & my partner had a shrimp dish which he also enjoyed. We like having a choice of rice. The portions are just right & filling. The prices are reasonable for specialty food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"If I was blindfolded I wouldn't have known what I was eating were vegetable matter. I'm a carnivore by nature but my experience with veggie village today changed my position on vegetarian eating. It was filling and clean going down. Will definitely come back for more next time peace out!"}
{"text":"Very friendly people, good service and the food came out quickly. The water was flavored with lime which was a nice touch. I was pleased that the music was at an acceptable volume."}
{"text":"Ya know, sometimes you look at a place with all 5-star reviews and kinda just roll your eyes, like, really? They can't be perfect. There is no way that they're THAT good. Well, honey child, let me tell you something... They were PERFECTO! 

We arrived at exactly 11am on a Friday and they were open and ready to serve.  The place is small (not too small), charming, and very warm (the aura, not the room temperature). I'm a booth girl (love me a booth) and I totally love their cute little booth spaces. We ordered at the counter and the employee brought our drinks and meals to the table.

I ordered the Spiced Salt Fish and the Tom Yam Fish (minus cucumbers). Both dishes came with your choice of white or brown rice. 

The Tom Yam dish was very tasty. It's a saucy dish, with a nice little spicy kick to it. 

That SPICED SALT FISH though!  My, my, my, mymymymy... I'm one of those people who typically add salt, pepper, sauces, etc to my dishes to give them more flavor. Not this dish. It was absolutely flawless just the way it came. (I almost asked my dish if it woke up like this!) The vegan fish was so perfectly fried in a light, yet very crispy batter, and seasoned beyond perfection. The jalapeños and garnishes were equally savory, creating an essential winning combination. I was blown away by the excellence. (Keep in mind, I LOVE salty foods. If you have high-blood pressure or any issues with salt, this is not the dish for you.) It's a dry dish, so I didn't really need the accompanying rice, but I ate it simply to prolong the joyful experience. 

My cousin also got the Spiced Salt Fish dish (which was great because I wasn't sharing), and in addition, she tried the Eggplant dish, which came with tofu.  She liked both, but agreed that the Spiced Salt Fish was the shining star.

The employees were very nice and attentive.  My water cup remained full and she brought us to go boxes when she saw us, in all of our gluttony, getting lethargic.  The employees that day got an extra gold star for patience. There was a patron sitting behind us who was very...challenging. He refused to order at the counter like everyone else and his God-like complex was truly baffling. So KUDOS to them for remaining professional, calm, and genuinely nice throughout his charade. 

Excellent food. Good portions for a fair price. I am slightly concerned that their location won't yield the business that it deserves, but hopefully, word of mouth will not only keep them afloat, but allow them to expand even.  Be sure to specify if you are vegan as they are not 100% vegan; however, non-vegan items are 100% vegetarian."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Phoenix from the DC area and a top priority was to get some great vegetarian food! Veggie Village was highly rated and was wonderful. We had tofu appetizer that was si much better than the normal pile of fried tofu and a dish if sauce. The tofu was underneath layers of fabulous fresh veggies like jicama, bean sprouts and carrots with peanuts and delicious sauce drizzled on top. It was so good i could eat it as a meal! The Kung Pao vegan chicken was fabulous. Instead of tofu, which can be overused in vegetarian recipes, the \"v-chicken\" was marinated mushroom coated and quick fried to give them a wonderful crispy exterior. The sauces for everything were spot on perfect!"}
{"text":"I met a couple friends at veggie village after seeing all of the positive reviews. I was excited to try food but was a little disappointed that they use a lot of fake meats instead of just using straight up tofu and veggies. I ordered wide noodles and just asked them to put in fried tofu and veggies and hold all the fake meats...they did this for me no problem. The noodles were super tasty! I also tried the potstickers, which were surprisingly good (most veggie potstickers are so sad). The prices were reasonable with most dishes costing around 10$. I'm not a vegetarian, but I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I thought they had really good variety and the staff were super nice and seemed accommodating to vegans. They asked us if we were vegan and were really to modify if needed. The only downfall is that a lot of the menu options are made out of soy....but overall a really good experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I where in town to make a trip to the Grand Canyon. And me as a vegan could not find any vegan options, until I found this place on yelp. We BOTH Loved it! Yes, even my meat loving husband loved his place. The to-fu pad Thai was great! And very savory.(I got mine non-spicy) we also ordered pot stickers and hose where also so amazing. Just on those alone I was feeling full. And that lead to my next comment about the amount of food you are served it was very much worth what you are paying for a good hearty amount! We really loved this place and wish it was in San Antonio Texas. But until then we
Will just have to wait till we are in Phoenix next time. There service was great to. Love supporting local business that are run by hard working families. So do not hesitate to give this place a try. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices. Don't miss the wrap or curry appetizers. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Be sure to let them know you are vegan, if you are."}
{"text":"I got the tofu satay and pad Thai, my husband got sweet and sour chicken and we both absolutely loved the food. The service was so friendly and fast too. I strongly advise anyone (vegan/vegetarian or not) to eat here, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Omg! The food was so good! The food was so good it caught me by surprise. It was fresh, delicious, and the portions were perfect. Best vegan food I have had in a while. The food satisfied that savory craving I had. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"me and my friend went here for lunch. the place itself is hipped but the food needs some improvement. we ordered the pad thai, hot and sour soup and the tofu satay. the food needs more flavor i must say...might not come back."}
{"text":"As a newly minted whole-food, plant-based diet person, I genuinely never thought I'd find vegan food at levels of this delish. The \"fish\" is actually vegetable and lightly fried to perfection. The sauce is scrumptious. EVERYTHING on the menu can be made vegan. Wtf. My new guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. It's obvious that the employees care a lot about your experience and want you to come back. Other businesses should take notes."}
{"text":"I am beyond satisfied! I had the Singapore noodles and I swear I meant to leave some on my plate (for pictures)..... Friendly staff, location is easy to find. Not a very big establishment, but not crowded. Also- it didn't take a bunch of time to get your food. Perfect place for vegetarians/ vegans/ pescartarians!"}
{"text":"Their orange chicken was awesome and I LOVED their honeydew/coconut milk/chia seed drink!  can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Owner responded with clarification on the menu and offered that they are improving their menu to be even MORE vegan friendly because so many of us are coming in, so revised to 5 stars."}
{"text":"One dish and I'm sold on the new vegan restaurant. I ordered the vegan eggplant & tofu dish with brown rice for lunch today, and I was so blown away by how pretty and delicious this dish was. The rice was cooked perfectly. There was plenty of tofu, and the eggplant was so fresh. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes from this establishment. Keep up the good work peeps. 
Follow me @brooklyn409 for more delicious food posts."}
{"text":"I could become a vegetarian if all vegetarian food wad this good! Our family of 4 all ordered something diffetent and every dish was excellent.  We have tried several vegi restaurants and never really liked them.  We could eat here every night!"}
