{"text":"Was on break from work and a heated sub was exactly what I needed. Was the only customer at the time I walked in, but both girls were very attentive and informative as I had never been here before. I ordered my food to eat in and a few customers came after me, but the lady that had took my order followed up with me and asked how it was tasting. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Best subs in az,  Homemade bread daily. Great specials. My favorite is the experience. There is something on the menu for everyone to enjoy"}
{"text":"Wasn't super impressed, I wanted to try after finding the restaurant on Dosh. In comparison to other sub shops I've frequented, it didn't seem too fresh. I also thought it was a bit overpriced at nearly $11 for a half size sub meal. Staff was very sweet, however!"}
{"text":"I ordered two sandwiches from here. One was just okay, but the cheese steak was the worst cheese steak I've ever had. I couldn't even finish half of the sub. I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the quality of my sub (Buffalo Chicken). The staff was super friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! Fresh bread, really flavorful meats, and generous portions. I had the Experience and my husband had the roast beef. Both were great. P.S. the chipotle sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here after shooting my bow at indoor range in the area.   I will say the food was excellent.  I had a ham sandwhich.  It was good.  The bread they served was fantastic.  I was really impressed with how good it was.  I will defiantly stop by here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time at planet sub and I must say I am very impressed. The vegetarian options they have available are to be commended. Very flavorful and filling. I had the tempeh Parmesan and added all the veggies I will return"}
{"text":"This is the second Planet Sub location I've tried and this time I took the Wife to see how she liked it. Well long story short, the sandwich's in Mesa are just as good as the location in Chandler....and the wife loved it as much as I do. The only difference is that they serve beer at the Mesa location. The server was great, very patient as the wife figured out what she wanted. We grabbed our drinks, sat down and before we knew it our food was at our table. Everything was fresh and hot. The prices are good and the food is excellent. Nice to have one close to work and close to home. Will be visiting both locations on a regular basis when we're hungry for a good hot sandwich."}
{"text":"I wanted a salad, husband wanted a burger. So we compromised on a sandwich shop. We stopped in because it was next to the movie theater. Kayla and Tiana made a recommendation and then helped to customize my order based on my wants. Husband loved the sub they recommended. They smiled all the way through my special instructions and offered to cut up the meats and cheeses for my salad. I would return based on the awesome customer service I got from these girls.  And the sub was pretty spectacular. He got The Experience toasted sub and I got the Hero Sub but as a a salad instead."}
{"text":"First time there today and had thr Green Turkey sub. Mind blown! The bread is AMAZING and the sub was absolutely delicious! The half is a good size plenty big enough to fill me up. I will say they are a tad pricey but have great quality."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was planning on meeting a friend at the AMC Theater to see the 12:30 showing of Spider-Man.  I was looking for some place nearby to meet for lunch that offered some healthy menu selections.  After looking at the Planet Sub menu online, I knew this was the place.  Being the miser that I am, I looked online for coupons and ended up purchasing a GroupOn deal for $9 to get $15 worth of food.  I ordered the Greek Chicken Wrap and asked that they serve that as a Romaine Wrap.  My friend ordered a half sub; we both got regular sized drinks.  Our total bill came to about $18 so we had to pay just $3.00.  The food was delicious!  The unsweetened iced tea was a bit weak but nonetheless good.  The service was exceptional . . . a very enthusiastic team who acknowledged us the moment we walked in and bid us a fond farewell. I definitely will go back.  In fact, if they were closer to my house I would have gone there for lunch today."}
{"text":"We used Planet Subs for one of our recent Employee Engagement Activities (over 300 people) and the food and service was AMAZING! Lynette is wonderful and truly cares about her customers and the quality of their food! We will definitely be using them again!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken sub was good, The tea was good as well.  My buddy got the Planet Sub and his had plenty of meat.  It was tasty and well prepared, you might like, give it a try.  Originally, I had an issue with my sandwich, but the gal doing sales behind the counter graciously walked around the the lobby asking how everyone's food is. I let her know my concern, I wasn't mad or jerky about so she let her manager know. A few minutes later she came out and asked if I would accept another sandwich free of charge. I was a little shocked, and don't like taking freebies, but I accepted. The replacement sandwich was amazing.  I highly recommend this place, food made well with great flavor and great employees & manager.  I will return, how could I not?"}
{"text":"Had the Cheesesteak and it was amazing! Added on some things to make it my way and they were more then happy to help me make my decisions. Hands down best sandwich I have had in a long time! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a \"pastrami melt\" and it was delicious!!!! My husband had an \"experience\" and loved his too!! Definitely going back there. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is it. I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur and a highly trained expert. I have to say that by far this is the best sandwich that I have ever had. Do yourselves a favor and eat at planet sub. You will not be disappointed. I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't quite have the same experience that the previous Yelpers had.  I did have an Experience, which was what the sandwich was called, but it wasn't quite the experience I was hoping for.  The ingredients sounded great on the menu, but it pretty much became a cream cheese sandwich.  Every single bite was filled with cream cheese...so much that I really didn't taste any other ingredients.  If deciding to go with that sandwich, I would definitely say light on the cream cheese.  In addition to that, my daughter ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, but received a bbq chicken sandwich.  She decided just to eat it because that was her second choice anyway.  She ended up not really caring for it either.  She said the bbq sauce tasted like McDonald's.  The hubby ordered a wrap and while he said it was just okay, he probably enjoyed it more than we enjoyed ours.  Service was good though.  The girl at the front counter was very friendly, asked if we had been there before, and explained how their menu works.  Overall, it wasn't the best experience and with so many other sandwich shops around, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from Planet Sub, on recommendation of a friend, a few weeks ago. I was stuck at work, but they are listed on UberEats, so I gave them a shot.   I chose the chicken parmesan sub and it was very good! The chicken was nice and warm, with melty cheese and not too much marinara sauce. I ordered the 12 inch sub and it was enough for me to take home that night! The price was just right, around $9 for a hot sub, delivered. Tasted way better than the usual sub places. Will order again!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic toasted subs, and they bake their own bread daily. They even have fresh baked gluten-free bread every day, and it actually tastes delicious! The people that work there are very accommodating, and they seem to take customer service as their first priority. Super friendly, great service, great subs!"}
{"text":"I have to say this sub shop is worth parking and walking across the parking lot in the blistering Arizona sun for. First they have great specials daily, free kids meal Monday is the best! And then the staff is so friendly and helpful, it's like they really enjoy their job. The food is also quality and they have a good size menu."}
