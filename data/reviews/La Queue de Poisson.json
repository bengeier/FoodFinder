{"text":"J'ai voulu tester ce nouveau restaurant. J'ai pris un fish and chips et des frites et à mon grand regret beaucoup trop gras j'ai été malade moins d'un quart d'heure après."}
{"text":"Delicious! Especially the haddock, and the key lime pie."}
{"text":"Vraiment trop gras et indigeste le fish ans chips. nous avons aussi essayé les calmars...même constat navrant : c'est gouteux mais bien trop gras. nous sommes allés cherché de la soupe de poisson congelée ... Nous avons été mal reçus, comme si on dérangeait...c'est bien dommage ! On avait le gout de les encourager mais ça ne marche pas..."}
{"text":"I got take-out and part of the fish was undercooked. Also I asked for tartar sauce but got garlic sauce. I went there a couple of weeks ago and it was nice, but food should never be undercooked, end of story."}
{"text":"A really nice hidden gem! I was walking around wellington with my girlfriend and saw this nice cozy place that sells everything you can think about seafood and fish. We started with a nice PopCorn Shrimp. Very tasty... With a perfect combination with the red ognion... And the mayo. Nice way to start.   After... My girlfriend ordered the fish and chip with salmon and I got the grilled salmon. Both came with a nice and fresh salad. It was a great combination with the homemade fries.   To top it all... We had each a beer with a great variety that they have.   I am giving it a 5 star and definitely will go again. The only thing is that even though it was a Monday and I am guessing it is usually not busy, I noticed that the guy in the cash was also the waiter and had to run around a little bit. Either way, good service.   Dont miss out on this precious gem in verdun!"}
{"text":"Service pourri pour les livraisons jamais correct toujours des probleme je ne conseille a personne de commander la 1h30 d'attente pour avoir une commande incomplete a chaque fois 1 seul etoile mes c vraiment parce que je suis obliger dans mettre une pour rediger cette evaluation"}
{"text":"Voici un bon restaurant de poissons dans le coin de Verdun ! Son petit plus ..? C'est aussi une poissonnerie ! Vous passez prendre votre poisson, voir même vous les appelez avant d'arriver et votre commande est prête pour cuisiner à la maison ! Tout est frais et selon arrivage.  Leur saumon fumé est excellent et fait maison ! Très bon coin à découvrir pour changer de l'éternelle viande/burger !!"}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant for the first time a little while back.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service.  Had the fish (haddock) and chips.  Food was hot and tasty.  Worth the trip... was so good, went back again later that week!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened in Verdun and I finally got to try it out. First off. Be ready for a small venue. I mean VERY small. Two tables only, and a small bar-looking table with 5 places on it. When the sun is out the terrasse is very nice, but on a rainy day, better to take out. The food was great, ordered a salmon fish n chip and it was delicious, it came with fries and on second thought, should've go with a salad. The greatest thing about this place is their fish selection to go. They take order by the phone for you to pick up and they can try to get some rarer fish if you're willing to wait."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup. Un des meilleurs endroits pour le fish and chips accompagné de frites et légumes grillés avec sauce cajun  Mais ne vous contentez pas des fishs and chips, goûtez également aux calmars, gravlax et saumon fumé.  Mou coup de coeur reste tout de même l'esturgeon fumé maison  Les prix sont raisonnables, l'ambiance sympathique, le service courtois."}
{"text":"Ordered some delivery fish & chips from this spot it and it was pretty good. Fish was nice and flaky and the fries endured the drive down to my workplace. Can't remember what kind of sauce I got but it was alright."}
{"text":"C'était vraiment bon. C'est exactement cela qu'on cherchait depuis longtemps, un resto où nous pouvons manger des produits de la mer, où les produits sont frais et sans être extrêmement chers. Un resto sans prétention, très convivial. Les spaghettis aux fruits de mer étaient excellent, le tartare de saumon bien épicé, parfait ... et la chaudrée de palourdes tellement réconfortante. On y retourne assurément."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré la grillade de maquereau. Elle est servie avec salade et légumes ou frites. Très bon service. Petite trouvaille dans Verdun. Je vais y retourner c'est sure."}
{"text":"I ordered a few items for delivery. Everything arrived cold. The shrimp, scallop, calamari medley included the smallest bits of seafood I have ever seen. Haddock fish and chips portion was tiny. Crab cakes had no crab. 65$ for three items all substandard. Will not order or visit again."}
{"text":"This really happened - a Bostonian walks into a Fish n Chips/Seafood Market and asks for the owner in a noticeable (and proclaimed) Cape Cod accent. I'm cool with that, I've got roots close to there too. He was excited that there was finally a purveyor of fresh seafood (Fish n Chips shop) in his neighborhood. Three generations of one of the owners' family come to meet him and offer samples of their home smoked Gravlax style and peppered Salmon, moist (yet salty) Monk fish, and salmon pâté were all served up on a cold platter with toothpicks. We both tasted away.   What a way to warm up the gullet, for the much anticipated heaping platter of 2 hefty pieces of beer battered Haddock, a virtual boat load of moist fries, cucumber covered mixed salad and some light yet tasty whipped tartar sauce. The batter was crispy and not lathered on too thickly. The fries had a nice taste without ketchup (as I found none handy), and just a splash of malt vinegar and ground pepper. The salad was fresh and healthy, but lacked any real dressing that I could detect (perhaps meant that way). I did manage to eat every last drop of food (despite being stuffed 2/3's of the way through).   I also tasted their very unique velvety, almost a purée of clam chowder \"chaudrée de palourdes\" (not New England style, much to our Bostonian friends chagrin), which was distinguished nonetheless. I detected some kind of sherry like liquor and even a chunk of squash (I could be wrong about either). It also disappeared down the hatch. My new late lunch friend tried the fried calamari and was quite pleased with the batter.  There were many other items on the large chalkboard food and drink menu (above a large wooden communal table), including popcorn shrimp, house made butters and sauces i.e hot ketchup and Cajun mayo. I saw some people drinking beer with their meals (and before 5pm, nice).  The interesting thing about this shop is that is not only has a Fish n Chips menu, but they sell fresh fish/seafood and you can get it cooked for an extra $7.00 (now that sounds like a welcome dinner plan). Another notable - there was nary a smell of fish, which is rare in a shop selling fresh fish.   Before leaving I washed my hands in the small yet clean washroom, and then checked out the frozen foods for take out, such as seafood lasagna and lobster bisque. Next to the freezer section is the live lobster tank (priced to market, so take a look when you are there), and on the opposite walls are sushi making supplies, other accompanying ingredients and spices for sale.  They will probably garner that 5th star upon a second visit, as there was too much to try and not enough room in my stomach.   I'm also glad they've opened up shop, but I'd better start saving up because I'll want to try it all - being the seafood lover I am."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Great food, great service at a reasonable price. Really lucky to have stumbled upon this gem in Verdun and will for sure go back in the near future."}
{"text":"I was on my way to another spot when I happened to be walking by and saw someone enjoying a lobster roll. I immediately changed my mind and came here instead and was very glad I did.  They have an outdoor terrace during the summer months and the inside also serves food along with being a fish monger. Surprisingly, it's a testament to how fresh the fish and seafood here is because it has absolutely no fishy smell. That's a big plus for me, as a kid I was dragged to another legendary fish market in Montreal, Waldman's, and the smell traumatized me, even to this day so I'm quite sensitive to these things.  I saw oysters on the offering, popcorn shrimp, lobster rolls, lobster salad, grilled octopus. I imagine their chalkboard menu changes often due to seasonal availability. June in Montreal means lobster season so I ordered the lobster roll. It came with fries and salad but seriously I practically inhaled the whole thing. Super friendly service, I plan on coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place and I'm glad I did. We all had the fish and chips (haddock). We asked the waitress about the sauces and since it was our first time she brought all of them over. The portions are huge, and I probably could have shared with my friend. So if you don't have a huge appetite definitely consider sharing. The fries were A-MA-ZING!!!!! The decor was also very on point, creating a fun and cozy atmosphere. It's a very small place, and we were there on a Saturday afternoon so it was very quiet. I don't know how busy it gets at night, but judging by the limited amount of seating it must get crowded. My only complaint is that I thought it was a tad pricey. Despite this, I'll definitely be back to try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent salmon. Purchased for dinner. I'll be back! In a convenient location and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Très beau décor et bonne nourriture, mais un service très pauvre pour un restaurant pourtant pas tant achalandé :( Nous avions l'impression de déranger. Dommage"}
{"text":"Ma première fois au Restaurant La Queue de Poisson à Verdun et j'ai adore ça   Arrivée vers 19:30 choix de place dehors sur la terrasse ou à l'intérieur à l'air climatisé. Nous on s décidé d'aller à l'intérieur du que s'était humide dehors   Table avec chaise ordinaire ou chaise en bois sur  Une bouteille d'eau froide et servis avec chaque table   2 verres de vin blanc et 1 coke comme breuvage    Le menu et vraiment juste sur le poissons et fruits de mer pas de viande dans le menu   Nous avons pris l'entrée à partager Le Marin qui est de Crevettes popcorn. Pétoncles popcorn. Et calmar frit et servis avec 5 sauces (paprika. Cumin. Cajun. Mayonnaise.
