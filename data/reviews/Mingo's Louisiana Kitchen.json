{"text":"Wow, great service, great food!!! The best fish sandwich I've ever had. Highly recommend for any occasion. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Mingo's truck came to our offices for lunch today. I had the catfish po' boy and seasoned fries (Old Bay seasoning-yum!), and it was fantastic. The fish was breaded and cooked perfectly. Along with the lettuce, tomato, pickles, and remoulade sauce, it made for one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.

Also, ordering was quick, easy, and friendly. Looking forward to seeing them come back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the food truck for a year or two and would even track it down to see where in the valley they were parked for the day to get my shrimp Po boy fix. Now I don't have to track them down any longer as they have opened a restaurant at 35th Ave and Southern on the Northeast corner.  The restaurant has a New Orleans feel and with fun music playing over the sound system.  I've always had great food from the food truck and today is no different. So happy to have a place to get some Louisiana cooking without the travel to the big easy!"}
{"text":"Thank you lord for putting this place here. Very delicious food and service was amazing. Considering the options we have in Laveen this is the best. Thank you and welcome"}
{"text":"Husband and I tried this place after seeing all the rave reviews. It definitely lives up to the hype! The hot chicken po'boy was delicious! The jambalaya was so good! My husband had the catfish and shrimp combo, and he said it was really good! The staff was equally as great. They were very nice and courteous. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Friday special 6/22 amazing! They have different daily specials and I'm so glad I stopped. True story: I was driving home and falling asleep and thought let me pull over and grab something to eat. I woke right up as soon as I got my bag because I couldn't wait to go home and eat. This is the best I've had in Arizona and I've had my fair share. If you can't give it a try today definitely stop in another day. 

My only dislike was the coleslaw was warm and wilted. (I like mine crunchy) still giving 5 stars cause that tarter sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Laveen.  Best po'boys, red beans and rice is amazing but the best is the prime rib special on Thursdays.  The prime rib is cooked to perfection, served with potatoes and vegetables, I can't get enough of it!!!  Salmon is on special sometimes and that's amazing too...you seriously can't go wrong here.  Oh and let's not forget about Sunday brunch with the bloody Mary bar....  Cory and his crew are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Wowwww! The food is off the hook. The food truck was in my location today and I have \"the privilege\", of having the Catfish PoBoy. It was a great portion and the catfish was cook to golden perfection. The meal also came with with deliciously seasons fries (not soggy). You must also try their homemade hot sauce, you can see the seasonings and the spice is the right amount. I honestly thought it was gonna be watered down due to the texture but it was perfect. Two thumbs up for me!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere easy going clean and relaxed. 
Food was only ok. I really should have tried something other than prime rib. My wife got sausage red beans and rice. It was good. I was a little surprised that the special was 25 bucks for prime rib with no au ju. Dinner was $45. 
I will try again but stick with a po boy. I'm sure this has promise but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is great...have been several times and the food is wonderful! Just wish they had more chocolate desserts not really a red velvet cake fan."}
{"text":"You've never had a shrimp po'boy until you've had Chef Cory's Shrimp Po'Boy!  The shrimp is perfectly deep fried in a light cornmeal breading, the homemade remoulade sauce is to die for and the bread is fresh and perfectly proportioned to the shrimp.  The cajun fries are so good too!  I highly recommend following his posts on FB and stop in at the truck whenever you can!  ok..now I'm hungry - going to search for him now!"}
{"text":"Wow, some of the best catfish I have tasted. Very good customer service and nice people..."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back here, wish it was closer to my area...What a great spot.  Best Shrimp Po Boy I've ever had today.  Great feel good vibe.  Met some really cool folks in there today that I had great conversation with, hope to see them again, my kind of straight up genuine peeps.  So anxious to go back here and get me some Shrimp N Grits etc, etc, etc.  A rare find in the Valley of the sun that does it this well."}
{"text":"Imagine my surprise at finding this fantastic truck at work today!  I ordeted the catfish po' boy and it was really yummy.  The fish was perfectly breaded and cooked.  The bread and toppings were also fresh and tasty.  Best of all, it came with some delicious fries that really hit the spot.

I am a fan ot supporting these local businesses and it makes it easy when the food is this good-give these guys a try, you won't be the least bit sorry!"}
{"text":"Had catfish sandwich and it did NOT disappoint at Las Sendas Food Truck Friday. Food was great as was the service and conversation with the chef. I can't wait until the next food truck Friday."}
{"text":"You definitely have to check this place out! The food is great and the portions are plentiful. I probably come here once a week. There's a standard set of menu items to choose from, but there are also daily specials. I'm never disappointed when I leave here. My favorites are the shrimp and grits (Friday special), shrimp po' boy,  and red beans and rice (a must have). The catfish is really good too, especially with their remoulade sauce. The customer service is awesome and it has a really comfortable \"at home\" type of feel."}
{"text":"The Nola menu, unusual preparation and quality of their food is just fabulous.  Fried catfish and the BEST hush puppies.  And daiquiris to die for!!"}
{"text":"I must have been living under a rock because I hadn't heard of Mingos food truck! Now they have a base location right in Laveen. So excited to have another amazing food spot in Laveen! We tried Mingo's and weren't disappointed! I had the shrimp po boy which was fantastic. Hubby had catfish po boy which was also amazing! Highly recommend Mingos!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the catfish and shrimp platter no slaw. Good portions. The catfish could be cooked a bit longer, It's too brittle. The shrimp was a little too tender also and suffered from the breading not sticking to it. I liked the flavor of the catfish but again it was too brittle due to undercooking. Less seasoning on the french fry's as they were a bit too over seasoned. The restaurant wasn't very busy so the food was done quick. I would go back it's a nice spot and clean overall. I wanna try the Catfish Po-Boy. Plus I like to support the local mom and pop businesses."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Mingo's for dinner. It was amazing. I have rarely said that of Cajun food out side of Louisiana but this place deserves it. I had the Shrimp po'boy and my girlfriend had the bad ass burger. My po'boy was bursting with flavor and every bite had shrimp. The bad ass burger was 2 patties with bacon on both the top and middle. The house made hot sauce really pushed it over the top for me. It is slightly sweet with good heat and just the right amount of vingery taste. I love this place and will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"So I am updating my review because I actually got to taste the food this time. It was the best fried shrimp and catfish I ever had. It was hot, crispy and seasoned well. Can't wait to get it again."}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant! Oh my goodness, absolutely amazed by the food. I'm from Texas and lived in Louisiana for many years. When a new Creole restaurant opened in Phoenix, I had to give it a go to see how authentic it was. Folks let me tell you, this is the real deal. Extremely fresh and rich in flavor seafood. The poboys are delicious and the bread is the perfect amount of thickness, and light at the same time. Where you can enjoy all of the flavor of meats in the sandwich. The Creole fries are a must, and the homeade hot sauce, needs to be marketed, it's the best I've ever had. Everyone must try this restaurant, you would be overly satisfied with how great this food is. Also it's very reasonable, you would not regret this experience. Kudos to the owner for opening this establishment up, because it was definitely needed. Put it on your bucket list folks!!! :^)"}
{"text":"The Mingo's food truck came to my office and being from the south I was craving some comfort food with big flavors. They definitely delivered. This food tastes like it's made with love, just how we do it in the south. Nothing fancy but good quality products and bold flavor."}
{"text":"First and LAST time giving the neighborhood's new restaurant a try. I had high hopes, based on the reviews, but this has to be the WORST food I've had in a very long time. All three meals were trash. Period, point blank. Two of the meals were thrown away, not even half eaten and the third meal was only eaten because my poor boyfriend was starving from working 12 hours today with no break. He literally had to drench his food in KETCHUP to stomach it. Waste of $45! For what it's worth, we had the shrimp plate, the shrimp and catfish combo plate, and the shrimp and catfish combo poboy. The consensus is that the batter used for the shrimp and fish lacked flavor and the shrimp barely even had breading on it. Some pieces of shrimp had none. The bread on the poboy was soggy. Gross. I didn't try the hush puppies, but nobody raved about them. Honestly, I want my money back. I'm low key irritated that I could've saved $25 and gone to Chipotle."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much Louisiana cuisine, so when I heard they were coming to my work I was excited. I decided to try the shrimp po' boy and fries. 

I am impressed! Great shrimp, battered and fried to just the right crispiness. A good fluffy bread, not too much lettuce and tomato, and terrific fries to go with. Very tasty. 

If you get the chance, check them out! I definitely look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Truly delicious when it comes to a food truck! I had the shrimp po boy - crusted deep fried shrimp on a french roll with lettuce, tomato and their special sauce, hot sauce on the side gave it a special KICK! Also - Cajun fries are spicy, tangy amazing! Really a great food truck concept - loved it!"}
{"text":"Went to Las Sendas food truck frenzy.  Mingo's cat fish was absolutely outstanding.  Best I have had since visiting Mississippi.  Our friend who dislikes fish even agreed that it was fabulous.  He even has a great
QUIET Honda generator which makes ordering very easy
Trying to find where he is today, so we can go back today"}
{"text":"Great food.  Ordered the Jambalaya,  3 different Po'Boys. All very good!  Will be back to try different things."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat
 The food is great.I have been there twice and will be will be back soon
All the food is very good."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good shrimp poboy for sometime and found this little gem.  First time here and the taste of the shrimp po boy was on point. The hot sauce they have available is so good I can drink it. 

Update: went back and tried the shrimp and catfish combo. The hush puppies are very good. The fish was decent but this combo is kinda pricey at $16 and change. Docking a star off for value. Taste is good but kinda high on price."}
{"text":"I just finished a heaping portion of short ribs over french fries and it was fantastic.  The cook was very friendly and my food came up quick.  It was a very reasonable price for the portion I was given.  I shared half my plate with a co-worker.  Next time I'll have to try the shrimp po boy.  It was a tough choice between that and the fries, but the fries were great!"}
{"text":"Always had great experiences with the food truck.  Not so great with my first visit at the restaurant.  I asked not one but twice for my oysters to be fried hard.  Why, because I do not care to eat soft oysters.  I also turned around and went back in to ask for remoulade sauce and was assured it was in the bag.  Get all the way home to find no sauce and mushy oysters.  Not to mention the staff was not warm and welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Want there with my family a few weeks ago. The food was amazing and so was the service. So glad to have this new addition to our community!"}
{"text":"Great flavor in the fish and the hot chicken sandwich was amazing. Love this place. Excited to have a regular go to spot in my area"}
{"text":"I had the bbq short rib fries & they were AMAZING! The service was quick & professional! Definitely A++++ 
I'll definitely have this again!"}
{"text":"Got the red beans and rice and sliders for my daughters! Great service, great food, will return to try some of their other items like shrimp and grits and their po boys.

I hope they stay around it's good to have some Louisiana food in the area! I'm a seafood and gumbo lover! I hope they can find a way to add gumbo to the menu"}
{"text":"They now have a permanent building. 35th Avenue and southern. Excellent food and good prices. 
Had the jambalaya and the sausage is fantastic. 
Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Mingo's is a new and fantastic restaurant; we deserve and need this caliber of food in the South Phoenix/Laveen area. The food is Cajun and mostly seafood, though they also have jambalaya and red beans and rice. I had the catfish and shrimp plate. The breading was light and crunchy and beautifully spiced. It was nearly perfect fried seafood. And the fries were great, doused with Old Bay seasoning, which is the only way I want to eat fries from now on.

My wife had the shrimp po boy, and that seems to be their speciality. She describes it as \"perfect\" and would not let me have a bite. 

The only way this place could be better is if they had beignets or were open Sundays."}
{"text":"Second visit, food is excellent but tough to get in touch with them. Phone number on website is to their food truck and recording gives number to restaurant but if that number is busy recording says mailbox is full. Also menu on website is not current so you have to ask what is available when you call. Will be back!  This area is starving for a real restaurant so this is a great addition. Shrimp poboy is great, crispy shrimp and awesome bread."}
{"text":"Stopped in hoping to find some food that matched what I could get back home. It did not disappoint! I got jambalaya and the portion was large enough to make a hearty lunch meal. I'm hoping these guys become regulars near work."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place is on point! I can't complain and the Shrimp Po'Bos were great. The next time I'm in Arizona I will be back."}
{"text":"Thanks Chef Cory for a great lunch. I had the shrimp po-boy along with seasoned fries. The flavor was right on point and the shrimp were fried expertly. Nice and tender. Now all we need in this Valley is the same type of French bread that po-boys are made with in New Orleans. 
I'll be looking forward to another great meal of yours soon."}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun food outside of New Orleans! The Jambalaya and red beans and rice are fantastic. The catfish is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something new here in Laveen and wasn't disappointed at all!!! I ordered the shrimp po' boy since I heard so many people ordering it and it was amazing. My sandwich was overflowing with large shrimp, and the sauce was delicious and creamy. The hot sauce they make here is one of a kind! It's a perfect balance of heat and vinegar, don't miss out on trying it! French fries were crispy and the seasoning on them was perfect! Will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"This food truck is awesome. The food and the service are great! The fish and shrimp are perfect and fresh every time. The prices are reasonable and great for the amount you receive. We are frequent customers. They are now opening a new restaurant which we can't wait to go to. It will be great to have a new quality restaurant to go to!!!! Blessings.."}
{"text":"Love going there! From amazing Prime Rib to delicious salads.  The owner is always on site and he's kind as are all the staff!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm awesome Cajun food :-) highly recommend the catfish :-) . I have had some Cajun food in the past that did not meet my standards Mingos did :-)"}
{"text":"So I my first experience with Mingo was at the Queen Creek festival. I tried the catfish po boy and I fell in love today I finally came into the restaurant.  I ordered the catfish dinner, of course it was awesome!! Loved everything will definitely be back!!! Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was not seasoned well but very fresh. I had the combo catfish and shrimp. I didn't care for the bus puppies."}
{"text":"Mingos now has a brick and mortar! So excited I don't have to chase the truck anymore!"}
{"text":"I got the jambalaya and old bay fried and couldn't be happier.  The price was incredibly affordable and it came with a ton of food.   I ate...maybe...half, and I'm a big guy. The music is the best and the staff was helpful. Come support this gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great, tasty food, big portions and friendly service. I tried their shrimp and grits and it was delicious. Their po boys and catfish dishes are great too. They serve beer now, and have a Bloody Mary bar on Sundays for brunch."}
{"text":"I had seen people comment on this restaurant on the local Facebook page and I happened to be nearby at around dinner time. Here are the key points: 

The place is clean and smells good. The menu appears to be written in chalk which leads me to assume it's always changing which I think adds to the excitement of eating somewhere that you might choose to frequent. 

The staff was nice and polite. I think the owner saw me ordering and he was kind enough to offer me a beer. While I was waiting for my Togo order to be filled he stepped out of the kitchen to ask if everyone else was ok and if they needed anything. 

I had a Shrimp po' boy and my wife asked me to order her jambalaya. We also split a red velvet cake. Everything was very tasty. The bun was the perfect amount of chewy. The pickle was mild and the breading on the shrimp was crispy.  

I think this is a place that wants to do well and wants to make good food. I will be back because I appreciate a place that cares about the food and the customer. I'm grateful they are doing it in Laveen. 

P.s: I forgot to take pictures but I will next time, I promise."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their fried shrimp and fries, then you haven't lived.  Best food ever!  High quality and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I love this food truck! It has the best catfish sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. Their fries that come with the sandwich are also very tasty, especially with the cajun spices on top. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just had a great early dinner at Mingo's. I had the bbq braised beef short ribs over fries, and my husband had a shrimp and catfish po-boy. But we're really good. The team working there is great, and we got to meet Cory, the owner. Next trip - either the Jambayla or one of the Cajun seafood platters. It's a bit of a trek for us - we live in N. Central Phoenix - but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"For those saying this food isn't authentic, I have to disagree. My wife and I tried the oyster/shrimp po boy, the Catfish po boy, and the red beans and rice. I was born in NOLA, and spent the first 25 years of my life 15 minutes from downtown. I've literally eaten hundreds of Louisiana po boys. This is the closest to authentic that I can find in the valley. Authentic po boys rely heavily on the right bread, and while the bread at Mingo's isn't exactly like Louisiana po boy bread, it's pretty close. It's really tough to get authentic po boy bread to AZ...I've tried. The breading on the seafood is a cornmeal breading, and is terrific. One other small detail that Mingo's gets right that most others don't, is that they use iceberg lettuce. ROMAINE LETTUCE IS NOT SERVED ON PO BOYS IN NEW ORLEANS. The menu is limited to sandwiches, red beans, and jambalaya, but the brick and mortar location has only been open for 2 months. I'm looking forward to an expanded menu. This NOLA family will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I have ate a lot of cajun food and the spices here just were not spot on. The jambalaya was not great because it was super spiced with someone strange."}
{"text":"So this is a great place to eat! It is a food truck that came to my work place this week. I ordered the BBQ Braised Short Rib Over Fries. And MANNNNN, it was delicious! And plentious!!!
My coworker ordered the Catfish basket, and loved it
The workers are friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Very Good! Finally a restaurant with some flavor - we really enjoyed it. We had the spicy chicken po boy - delish!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Old Bay Fries and Catfish Po'Boy and both were out of this world!! Highly recommend anyone try this truck, the owner was super friendly and we had a great time chatting with him. Thanks for a lovely afternoon and delicious food too!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not impressed. The batter on my catfish fell off with the fist bite; surprisingly this was the only thing without extra salt. I was extremely excited that somewhere close to me had red beans and rice but I couldn't eat them because someone apparently dropped the bottle of salt in them and they still served them. The french fries were salted and then old bay added (over seasoned) so I would not eat them. They garnished the plates with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles which was a waste of product. If I'd wanted that, I'd ordered the po boy sandwich, it just wet my catfish. I guess the only difference between the sandwich and the plate is less the bread. I had high hopes but very disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here once and the food is great just a little bit spicy for me. The catfish was good. Loved the sausage in the jambalaya but the rice was good but spicy. Will have to go back and try to find something else that I can eat."}
{"text":"A great setup and great food with great customer service. Loved meeting Corey and his mom when they just had the Food Truck. Proud to see him take it to the next level and open up a restaurant. More food for more people and he created more jobs in Phoenix. 

My favorite is the Catfish Platter, Catfish Po'Boy, Shrimp Po'Boy, and the Red Beans and Rice. The Hush Puppies are official as well. 

The Old Bay Fries are delicious and always fresh. 

I also have had the Bad Ass Burger and it's good juts was a bit more than I expected. 

Weekly dessert options are good as well. 

Give them a try and tell him J. Jones from My Radio PHX sent you."}
{"text":"This place SUCKED now hear me out I bet the food was grate but I didn't even get the time of day the guy was giving me a hard time about ordering from the kidd menu because I didn't have a kid I stated I had a small appetite and he rolled his eyes making me super uncomfortable and told me the meals were designed for kids and I said YES I KNOW it's made smaller that why I want it and he had asked irritatedly why I wanted two. Know one was in the restaurant like he lost customers because he was questioning my eating habits like does McDonalds tell adults they can't have happy meals no I didn't think so! Skroo that guy we left good luck with your business buddy"}
{"text":"Best food truck around.  Great value for the price!"}
{"text":"We decided to do our Galentine's Day celebration at Mingo's. It's a little small, but there is plenty of seating for the size that it is. The bathroom doesn't have a changing table, so that's a downside if you have a baby. The food was great! It's nice to taste the river water in your catfish. Hush puppies were a little dry but the fries were great! Staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Yum! And my son gave it 2 thumbs up. Shrimp po boy. Red beans and rice. Hush puppies. Coleslaw! And their fries. Can't wait try the shrimp n grits. Ohhhh and can't wait for the patio opening!"}
{"text":"Great place with real Cajun food. Friendly staff and owner.  Amazing hot sauce. Love this gem."}
{"text":"Delicisous Scratch cooking! It doesn't get any better than that. 

Local Family that uses locally sourced ingredients when possible. They are an asset to the community and I hope to see their business continue to grow!"}
