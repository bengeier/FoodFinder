{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  The address to the complex where I'm at also starts with the building number I am in 1228.  After arguing for 5 minutes to try and explain how the building number IS 1228 they just hung up on me in mid-sentence.  I had to call back and AGAIN after arguing with the person they finally conceded to me being right.  They were trying to tell me I don't know what my own building number is that I live in.  Did not appreciate the tone or being hung up on and it was an hour and 15 minutes just to get the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Frank's.  I had seen them on Eat24, but since picking up an order from them involves a 9 mile roundtrip, I hadn't gotten around to trying them until tonight.  My overall impression:  just OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and the crust had a dense, pillowy texture that I didn't much care for.  The sauce, cheese and pepperoni on top of the crust were actually pretty tasty, though.  Inexplicably, there was a small section on my pizza that was completely devoid of cheese and pepperoni.  Ordering with Eat24 was easy, although I should point out that there isn't an option for extra cheese on the menu.  I left my house within five minutes of ordering, and when I arrived at the restaurant my pizza had about two minutes to go, so the speed of service was fine.  The quality of service, however, was a bit lacking -- much of which I attribute to the fact that the counter guy was young and probably didn't have a lot of experience.  As for the value...honestly, it wasn't great.  Without the $2 online coupon I used, the medium 12 inch one-topping pizza I ordered would have cost $13.53, which is higher than what the pizza joints in my neighborhood charge for a comparable or higher quality product.  (Overpriced, average pizza could be one of the reasons I was the only customer inside the place at 7PM on a Saturday night...)  Would I return?  Probably not.  Frank's is just too far of a drive for me when better and cheaper pizza is available closer to home.  But, as always, individual results may vary.  If you're in the neighborhood, you should give them a try at least once and decide for yourselves."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  Promised around 9pm.  Did not arrive until 10pm.  When calling, they don't have a clue as to the location of the drivers.  Worst service ever.  WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! I can't say enough good things! The people are so sweet and wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a 20\" pie and some cheesy bread, my order got here in a timely manner and I must say it was amazing pizza. Will be ordering franks again that's for sure."}
{"text":"TL; DR version: Large portions, really good prices, great for feeding the entire family. Ample topping sizes for pizza's. Decent, average size wings and they don't skimp on the sauce. Definitely not gourmet, so don't order expecting over-the-top Gyro's and succulent seasoned  fancies. Fast delivery, best for those who appreciate fast street foods.    Actual review: We're from El Paso, TX, where there are hardly any home-style delivery options. Most options are commercial (PapaJohns, Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc); and I'm not really a pizza fan, but if I'm hungry enough I'll go deep into anything delicious. I decided to go with Frank's A) because we're new here and it's in the hood, and B) the prices are good, and C) I have teenagers who love anything that even remotely resembles pizza. I purchased the 2 Large 1 topping and 40 wing family pack (comes with 4 ranch). Total feeding was 4; total price not including tip was $40.00. Like I said, we're used to stuff like PapaJohns where you can easily drop $50 bucks for a 2 large pizza, drink and bread knot combo, so ordering from Frankies was def more appealing. Once you tally in delivery, tax and tip, you average out at about $50.   I, for one, enjoyed and preferred the Frank's deal because it felt like we were actually getting our money's worth and surely this food will last all day. The pizza was good, not too much marinara just how I like it, and the toppings were a hearty size. Cheese covered the entire pizza and the crust was soft. Like I said, I'm not a huge pizza fan, but this was a good pizza and the price works.   Wings come in 3 flavors with 3 spice variants: BBQ, Honey BBQ, and Buffalo (Hot, Medium & Light). We opted for half Honey BBQ and half Medium. I'm not a big hot wings fan either (I know, what kind of American am I, right?). I find most pizza places usually over cook their wings and tend to carry limited flavor options, so I didn't go in expecting the world. These wings were okay and the flavor was good. Frankie's definitely didn't skimp on the sauce and there was no weird chicken taste. I mean they're made in bulk and served in large quantities so don't expect gourmet. They're not too fancy but taste good, ranch was ample and they're a good deal, so I'd definitely order them again.  Overall this place was okay and I'd stop by for lunch anytime while browsing the neighborhood. I gave it 3 stars because it's not a favorite, but if they serve beer then I'd definitely grab by for a slice with friends. I think this place did great filling up my teenage kids so that's what matters most. Anything beats ordering the same generic PapaJohns service, so I'm glad Frank's is just around the corner.     ***Best part: Delivery was IMPECCABLY fast!***"}
{"text":"The pizza, cheese bread, calzone are all great. The crew are usually dbags, so I order through grub hub.  I would recommend this place, just use one of the other ordering methods."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok but the service was terrible. I stopped in for a quick lunch and got the slice special but it ended up taking an hour after waiting several minutes for someone at the front counter and then again for the slices. The place was empty other than myself, yet I couldn't get any help/service."}
{"text":"Bomb sauce!!! Haha literally!  This is my first time ordering from here.  I will be back for sure.. i ordered the garlic cheese bread..... so good,  a nice blend of flavors and not to garlicky like some... i also got the ravioli in marinara sauce, its amazing! It even came with a piece of bread lol. The turkey club for 6.99 i figured i would get a sandwich on regular bread,  you know nothing special. .. its a 12in sub!!!! For wat i paid i got my money's worth!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Frank's Pizza on Indian School. I placed my order today 3/18/2012 online at 3:15 for pick up. When I arrived 40 minutes later I was informed that their system was down so they never got the order. Got my money but not my order. I figured ok, things happen, I reordered in person this time and requested they deliver, and was told I would have to wait another 40 minutes. 60 minutes later I called and was placed on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up, called back and was told the driver had the order. 20 minutes later (i live 5 min away), I go to Frank's pizza and demand my money back. I witnessed the delivery guy return and noted he was not carrying my order. Hmmm. So on top of really poor service I had been lied to as well. While I was waiting there (both times)  i watched a really incompetent staff handling the food with bare hands, the place seems also to be in the midst of remodeling (no longer carrying the ice cream). Poor service. Lied to, incompetent staff, mishandling of the food. I'm calling Mamma Mia's from now on, a little longer wait but worth the wait without the aggravation."}
{"text":"This food is awful and will not be ordering again!  The sausage parmaigana sandwich is made with polish sausage!  Who does that?  The wings are so salty they are unedible!"}
{"text":"Let me first say, I like Frank's food. They have a wide selection of food and everything at least USED TO BE great. Seems to be a few months ago something changed... Delivery now takes forever, orders are wrong, customer service is nonexistent, the wings contain little meat now, and no managers to be found.   The way they've changed their business makes me regret that I had my whole office ordering from them. Granted if you order a cheese steak sandwich, it could be confused with cheese sticks. That's why an order taker should repeat your order back to you.   Last time I had a problem with them was the first time I've ever had a problem. I was hoping it was a one time thing. The manager at the time rectified it with fixing my order and offering me 20% off my next order. Good deal. Even though I had to wait 2+ hours to receive the wrong order, I try to be understanding.   This time there was no rectification, not even a call returned. I had to wait over an hour for my food when I was quoted 30 minutes. When I called to find out where it was, I was told they were busy. When the delivery driver had to inform me they were out of something (the reason I ordered from them in the first place) AND the order was wrong, I was hungry and cranky to say the least. I called back in to speak to the manager because they gave me an appetizer instead of a sandwich, he was conveniently not there. The order-taker offered to make me a sandwich and deliver it to me personally. I was satisfied with that. To my dissatisfaction, he called me five minutes later with another excuse that it was the end of the night and they had turned off the machines. It's obvious lack of management when a business is open for 15 more minutes and should be taking orders in that time to maintain profitability. So lazy employees decide to take off early.   Hopefully they will change back to the way things used to be and I can order in confidence once more. Until then, if you order from them - pick it up so you know if it's wrong right away and you don't have to wait at least twice of the quoted time. If you order delivery, I suggest ordering the exact opposite of what you want. This way, they might get something right.   Why, Frank's? Why did you have to break my pizza loving heart?"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have every had in my life.  Honestly, I don't know how they are still in business.  We were having a few kids sleep over and everyone voted for pizza.  Our regular restaurant usually takes over an hour on a saturday night so we decided to go with Franks- quicker and closer.  Well, when my husband an my 4 year old went to pick it up, they said that they never got the online order.  After looking for another minute- they found it and rushed to the back to make it up.  Oh yeah- they were out of wings.  (Frank's Pizza and *Wings* were out of wings...)  And they couldn't refund us the money because online ordering is through a third party.  Fine- we chose $12 worth of other appetizers.  People came and went picking up their orders so it was clear that they could actually produce food from the kitchen.  After 45 minutes, still no food.  I even called from home saying we just wanted to cancel our order.  Couldn't do it... again because we ordered through a third party.  Never complain about food before it comes out of the kitchen.  An hour later they produce our food.  (Remember that our 4 year old is still waiting there.)  They forgot the salad.    We honestly should have thrown that thing in the trash on the way out because not only was the cheese pizza thin as paper, but it was burnt.  The boys on the sleepover rolled their pizza from the tip in towards the crust for fun and it was still no thicker than a roll of nickels.  We also got an \"adult\" pizza with meat and veggies.  My husband wouldn't eat it because he was so put off by the whole experience.  I had one piece and couldn't stomach any more.   It just tasted funky.  I'm trying to fight my paranoia a week later, but my stomach hasn't been the same since.    After doing some searches, there are more violations on this restaurant than should be legal.  How are they in business??  Please either boycott this restaurant or the health department should shut it down.  Truly awful."}
{"text":"I've never been to the actual restaurant, but this is my #1 pizza delivery joint!  We probably get Frank's close to once a week. Delicious pizza and wings every time!"}
{"text":"the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  We have lots of kids and it was delivered promptly and so very very good! We will definitely be ordering from here again!! We eat lots of pizza by far the best we have had yet :) We had the calazone  and it was so stuffed and yummy. Cheese sticks were way more then we expected and the turkey  sandwich was to die for :) and pizza was devoured! Definitely will recommend to anyone and everyone I know :)"}
{"text":"I hope I happened to stop by on an \"off\" day.... Ordered a meat lovers pizza over the phone and was quoted a 20min wait. I showed up after only 15 because I was near by, but then had to wait another 25 min before my pizza was ready. When I got home with my pizza, the crust was so thick and the whole thing was under cooked (I'm not sure what was cooking for the 40min I waited for this thing!) Even after throwing slices into my own oven to try to crisp them up, they were still mush. The flavor wasn't anything to write home about.... It was just \"eh\"."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza to be sent to my wife for her birthday and asked for it to be delivered at a specific time, they were right on the dot! I cannot thank them enough for making my wife's birthday memorable!!!! She said the pizza was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"5 Star wings! Absolutely delicious hot wings. But only 3 Star pizza... Not the best crust, but it's still good for the price. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided we'd stop in for a quick bite one day after I bought my very first type writer from the place next door.  Actually we got their cookies and cream Thrifty's ice cream that day and decided we must come back for a slice of pizza another.  So the day finally arrived and I was enamored with the black and white tile inside; always gives me that happy feeling.  Anywho onto the product.  The slice of pizza was made in a timely manner and was also huge and delishious and totally worth the couple of bucks with the drink that came along.  I really cannot wait to go back and try their fish and chips."}
{"text":"Bottom line: best pizza at the best price. My boyfriend and I stop in and get their lunch special (2 pieces of pizza w/ a drink for $3.99). I like that the slices for the lunch special are larger than the slices you get if you just order a whole pizza from them (although their whole pizzas are a great deal too). So basically you're getting 4 slices when you get 2 for the lunch special. All for $8 for the two of us.  As far as dining-in, I don't usually like to. The place is run-down and not so cute. But I love supporting local businesses and this is a great one. Beats Domino's or the recently stingy Papa John's any day."}
{"text":"After placing an order online, the delivery driver brought it to the wrong address and fought my elderly father on the miscommunication. After seeing my father being visibly shaken by the confrontation, I called Franks to express the concern. The manager I spoke with was immediately on edge with me and shouted \"YOU HAVE A NICE DAY!\" before slamming the phone and ending the call before we could even resolve the matter.  We were long term customers of Franks, but not anymore. We will be sure to dissuade anyone from using Franks for their pizza delivery. Too bad, was a pretty good pie."}
{"text":"Awesome! Kind of a divey place and not good for eat in but this is your neighborhood take-out pizza joint! Some reviews complain about bland crust, I disagree (most because I always get enough ranch and wing sauce to dip my crust in anyway). Have also had the wings (delicious, and sauce is so good) and the chicken strip salad which is also great! The guys who work here are really busting their butts on Friday nights too, they do a great job making sure your order is ready on time (you can order on their website, grubhub or yelp). Currently they are running a special on their website for 10% off your order, not sure for how much longer but it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Not really that impressed with this place. I ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle BBQ wings.  The wings were disappointing - the sauce, which I was hoping would at least be interesting, was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much flavor.  They forgot to cut the pizza, which was kind of annoying. I tried a few toppings, half sausage and roasted red peppers, and half ham and olives. The sausage was pretty much just sliced hot dogs, and the rest of the toppings were not noteworthy. The rest of the pizza was equally not noteworthy.  Overall, just overpriced and not that great."}
{"text":"Family owned business. Good pizza, good specials, decent menu. I personally like the pizza and wing special."}
{"text":"Tried this place out recently for dinner and was not very impressed.  Delivery, however, was very quick and they were very friendly on the phone.  Prices are decent, but the pizza was extremely bland.  The wings weren't very tasty either and the fried zucchini/mozzarella was equally as bland.  I would not go so far as to say I would recommend them to a friend."}
{"text":"Food was good. We order Italian subs and fries. Ingredients were fresh! The person working was very friendly, BUT it absolutely took forever to get our food. After a long morning of hiking we may have been a little famished, so I tried not to exaggerate, but after waiting over 40 minutes for a sandwich we were justified in feeling a bit frustrated. We were the only people there and there were three people working. Overall I saw one or two people stopping for pizza pick-up so maybe that's the way to go?"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and some of the best wings in town. Friendly fast service. Great prices.  Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. However the pizza was like cardboard with burned cheese, and bland. I ordered a 2 liter soda pop online, and was told by the delivery driver that they were out and would give me a credit for next time i ordered from them. That was unacceptable, as i am never ordering from them again. The delivery driver did not understand my frustration with that and was rude and condescending when i complained."}
{"text":"I called ahead for a postponed delivery; the pizza arrived 20 minutes later than scheduled. I ordered thin/crispy crust; it was thin, but it definitely wasn't crispy.  Minus a couple hiccups, their pepperoni and sausage pie was delicious.  I'll use Frank's again, but I won't call ahead for a scheduled delivery and I'll repeat the crispy request several times."}
{"text":"lets just say i lost sleep thinking about eating my leftover slice from here.. but i maintained and was resilient in making myself wait for morning, rather than giving in to the inner glutton and going on an all night binge snack bender. im glad i waited, though. i appreciated it a little more the second time around. ill be going back to frank's. the slices, they haunt me"}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza! I had 2 slices and a pop for $3.99 and they weren't just huge they were so good best pizza I've had so far!"}
{"text":"Definitely adding this to my lunch rotation!  The pizza was fresh and hot and delicious!  The service was outstanding and the place was clean.  My only complaint is that I can't get the 2 slices and a soda special delivered."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good and so were the wings but without good ranch, it just kills the entire meal.  I'll never understand how pizza and wing places can have basic ranch that tastes out of a packet."}
{"text":"We were stuck for something to grab to eat. Nothing marks this place out: yet another pizza place in yet another strip mall. But the pizza was actually quite good."}
{"text":"we order food for delivery all the time and thought we would try Frank's out. we placed the order at 11:30 and the soonest they could deliver was 12:40 pm. 12:40 came and went and still no pizza. When we called the restaurant to ask about where our food was at 1:05pm, they didn't ask for a name as to see what order it was just told us that the driver just left and should be there any minute, then hung up on us. I don't care if this is the best pizza I've ever eaten I WILL NOT order from them again. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza and wing joint around Phoenix. Place has been renovated and has new owners managers and employees. Ordered pizza and wings it was delicious."}
{"text":"We were in town to take my daughter to Phoenix Children's Hospital. Instead of ordering from the nearest corporate chain I decided to try one of the local pizza places. We ordered an extra large with pepperoni, mushrooms and black olive. We placed the order through Yelp/Eat24 and paid by cash. The pizza came early to our hotel, 2 miles away, and was delicious. They are a good, basic pizza place. They have a tasty, salty mozzarella they use. My wife liked it too. We will order from here again when we are in town."}
{"text":"4 stars bc it's excellent value pizza. Getting pizza by the slice is the best way to order here. Great place for a 6-7 dollar lunch.  It's not a high end fancy place, just a great quick pizza place.  Service is great!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a little nervous going to this place.  I've driven by the center literally hundreds of times over the years, and have never noticed the pizza shop.  It was only just recently that I noticed them, based on their sign on the street advertising the lunch special of two slices and a soda for $3.99.  Fast forward to a few weeks later when I was sitting at my desk pondering where to go, but being unable to decide.  My memory bank finally remembered Frank's and away I went.  I gotta admit, I was extremely nervous going in.  Here it was, right in prime lunch hour and there was nary a soul to be seen, other than the guy working there who was in the back (maybe it was Frank!).  Anywho, takes me order, and goes back to make the pie and I sat down and waited.  And waited a little bit more.  Then a guy came in and 'Frank' came out and chatted with him as they appeared to know each other.  Then a little more waiting happened.  I thought it was taking way too long as this point, seems at any other 'slice' joint I go to (Ray's/NYPD/etc.), it's just a few minutes.  Finally, 'Frank' brings my slices out and apologies to me that they were in the oven too long and would I like him to make new ones.  Well...I looked at that pizza, and all I saw was golden brown delicious cheese staring at me.  Which to me, is great when you have nice golden brown cheese.  So I told him no need, it looked great to me, and I started to chow down.  While the temperature was hot, and I kind of burned my mouth a bit (stupid lack of self control to wait for it to cool), the pizza was terrific.  I mentioned the cheese before, but the crust was also very good, being nice and crispy on the bottom.  And then, when I got to the thick part, not only was the crust nice and chewy, the bottom was still crispy.    Overall, a good couple slices of pie.  I'm likely to go back!"}
{"text":"The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point, it's just overpriced greasy food. Bummer."}
{"text":"Stopped into Franks for lunch Saturday after I had dropped off some items for consignment next door.  Couldnt decide what to get, either the 2 slice special or the gyro combo.  So I asked the guy at the register taking my order to choose for me.    What I got was a gyro with fries combo.  The fries were nice and crispy.  And well the gyro was not terrible, but I could tell the meat was probably something you could purchase from a store and then reheat.  It was not from sliced fresh from a gyro loaf like I've gotten from other places.  The slices were too uniform.  Don't get me wrong, it was not all that bad though.  However, to the guy that makes the food....go a little lighter handed with the tzatziki sauce.     Next time I'm at the store next door around lunchtime, I'll give the Frank's Pizza a go."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars! This place has the worse service and even more terrible delivery service! Waited for an hour and a half for delivery called 7 times to cancel the order for them to hang up once and then tell me they can't give me my money back! They were extremely rude and not helpful at all!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I have never had a worse experience in my life. Absolutely horrible service. My recommendation is to never go here."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place ever.  Completely got my order wrong; couldn't find it when I called in.  After 5 minutes on hold, finally got to a person who couldn't then my order.  I was then put on hold to talk with a \"manager\".  I am not sure what he manages, but customer service is definitely not in his skill set as a manager.  The pizza was entirely wrong, the manager was rude, refused to help, and then told me \"do whatever the hell you want to do\" and hung up.  Yeah, great service from this establishment!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Frank's on the Eat24 app.  Order initially placed at 9:18.   At 10:20, still nothing so I called.  They said, \"you never gave us the hotel room number and the driver is looking for you\".  Um, I generally don't give my hotel room out, you could have called from the house phone for me to come down and you also had my cell phone.  All that being considered, I gave the person my room number and got the pizza.  Pizza was *meh*.  Crust was really dry and pizza was stuck to the paper at that point.  You figure the story ends there... But no!  At 1:45, I'm awoken by my phone ringing and pounding on my door shortly there after.  A look through the peep hole reveals a dude with a pizza in hand... \"Have your pizza delivery\".  Really?  I'm all set pal, go away.  Perhaps the folks at Frank's would like to give me their home address so I can come on over and pound on their door in the middle of the night.  Lousy delivery service, bad pizza.  Stay away."}
{"text":"My friends and I had pizza delivered. It tasted decent.  I was impressed with how quick it was delivered and the pizza was still very hot."}
{"text":"I got the 2 slice medium drink combo. The flavor of the pizza was good but very thin. I put the slices on each other and it barely made the thickness of a normal slice. But for 4 dollars its def worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery. Was quoted 45-60 minutes. Pizza showed up at the 75 minute marker. No apology, and pizza was rubbery from sitting in the warmer too long. What a waste of time and money. There are MANY better options out there for pizza than Frank's."}
{"text":"Good pizza for sure. Slice and a drink for lunch won't break your pocket. Just a divey, neighborhood pizza spot but worth a try. They have more than just pizza but I've yet try anything..."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and Raviolis. I usually pick up and it's always 20min or less to be ready.  4 cheese pizza is amazing  will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Pizza. Pizza never changes.  Frank's used to provide pizza to my high school cafeteria 10 years ago. I thought I'd give em another chance now that I live in the neighborhood.  The pizza was alright then and it's still alright.  The delivery was not good. The person was nice enough but forgot my two liter and then came back with a regular and not a diet (I can't drink regular for health reasons) and made no offer to fix it. I wouldn't have taken him up on it, but just the consideration would be nice. He was super apologetic, but, that doesn't make up for the $3 two liter that will sit in my fridge until I have a party and need a mixer.  It also took sixty minutes which is absurd for a pizza I order at 11 AM."}
{"text":"The food at franks is terrible the worst value for the dollar I wouldnt feed their food to my dog... franks sucks hands down terrible"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not those damn tiny teeny 1 person pizzas for $20 like most places in downtown Phoenix! HUGE big slice delicious greasy heaven. And yes, the price is right. The establishment itself screams classic. Mostly bare, couple rag tag tables, minimal decor, lots of focus on just eating good pizza. Haven't tried the wings yet, but I am looking forward to it. Thanks Franks!"}
