{"text":"i'm glad to find the restaurant hidden away from the busyness of the city. I took my bf there for his birthday and it looked like he enjoyed it! the view was beautiful at night, but it's not a huge deal if you live DT The seats were comfortable and surrounding is elegant. service was timely and attentive.  appetizer:  Truffled Gnocchi Parisienne - smelt so good, asian flavour on the dish. lots of ingredients... i would give this a solid 4/5  Duck Pastrami - bf enjoyed it, i tried one piece, liked it more than mine, it felt high class, like something you'd serve to president obama (or ex-p??) (from master chef...) 4.5/5  main: Halibut - i was disappointed in this dish, though bf said that was what he expected. i found the fish to be dry and lack of flavour. i was expecting it to be in some sort of soup/sauce to make it more moist. - 3/5  Grilled Sea Bass - i absolutely loved it! it was so juicy, and also the garnish were very well seasoned and they perfectly complimented the dish. - 4.5/5  desert:  the famous coconut cream pie!!! we shared one and the restaurant was nice enough to write 'happy birthday' on the dish and there was a also candle! a nice surprise. we both loved the pie even though bf isn't fond of dessert as i am. half point taken because i didn't like the weird hard/crunchy coconut bits... 4.5/5  red wine - no rating, bf said it smelt like our 2-yr old cheddar cheese... tasted like anything from lcbo.  total cost is about $200 for two. it's a decent meal and was worth it but don't think i can do this everyday. took us 2.5 hours to finish the whole meal, and i saw lots of older people there.... the ones who have both money and time. good place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"My lovely boyfriend took me here for our Anniversary dinner. I'm reading all these reviews about Lobsterlicious - which I'm sad we missed!  Regardless, this restaurant encompasses why we pay more to eat at a fancy restaurant. The service is impeccable (5 stars).  It's unfortunate i can't seem to remember what the appetizer I ordered was called but it was amazing. It was off-menu/special of the day. It was a light pasta with pesto and tomato and onions and mushrooms, etc. My main was the Patridge - which was mediocre as I felt the meat was really bland/flavourless. Regardless, I still loved this restaurant!  My boyfriend ordered the soup of the day and the Lamb. He loved it! Oh and for desserts we got the Coconut Creme Pie and Creme Brulee - amazing!   The view is nice added touch too :)."}
{"text":"After reading all those reviews saying \"worth every penny\", \"perfect experience\", etc., my expectations were quite high - but, with high-end restaurants you are threading at that dangerous slope of the cost/return ratio where a giant leap in price does not necessarily translates into a giant leap in food/service.   Scaramouche did some things quite well, such as a surprisingly flavourful and well balanced amuse-bouche and a really good lamb. Some other dishes were merely OK, like our dessert. But then it failed in very basic things, like missing the cooking point of my wife's fillet mignon. This is unacceptable. To make matters worse, the waiter did not come to our table to ask about how our food was - in fact he barely took time servicing our table or going through the menu options.  I would leave a 4 stars review had our dinner been \"just OK\", but those rookie mistakes are hard to forgive."}
{"text":"Food - excellent, service - excellent, ambiance - excellent. Scaramouche deserves no less than 5 stars and justifies its position in Toronto's top restaurants.   The food is perfectly executed from beginning to end and there's not much to fault in any of the dishes. You can taste the layers in the sauces and the effort that was put into every plate.   Notable highlights: (apps) grilled octopus and duck gnocchi; (entrees) lamb, partridge and venison; (desserts) coconut cream pie, rhubarb and cream puff. Note the menu does change from time to time, but the restaurant favourites - lamb, filet mignon and coconut pie (and potentially others) - should be always on the menu.   The service is on point and the view that you have of the Toronto skyline is a treat for those who may be coming in from out of town.   If you're looking for a special restaurant to spend your evening with spectacular food, come to Scaramouche. The food, service and view of the city well make up for the 'interesting' basement location.   Food - 10/10 Service - 9/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Value - 9/10 Overall - 9.5/10"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to have a romantic date. Terrific views of the Toronto Skyline from the north looking south. Don't forget the Creme Brulee! To die for. I have been a couple of times now and the service was 5 stars each time."}
{"text":"Tried some unique dishes here tonight.  Appetizers were tempura squash blossoms stuffed with king crab and foie gras terrine.  Tried two mains - Muskovy duck (a first for me) and partridge breast stuffed with chanterelles and wrapped in bacon - both delicious, moist and tender.  Raspberry tart was a perfect ending to the meal.  Service was attentive and five star.  The panoramic view of Yonge and Bloor was a spectacular backdrop to the restaurant which was the last thing you expect in the lower of a condo.  Free valet parking made this very accessible.  For more details on the meal, visit my blog at foodsparks.blogspot.ca."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect, highly recommended. We came here for our anniversary.   To start, they brought warm bread and butter which was a great app!   The food is gorgeous and the only way to describe the chef's special is to say you're eating something smooth, creamy, crunchy all at once!  We ordered the scallops and the crab cake to start. Both were absolutely perfect! I would strongly recommend the scallop! YUmmmmmm  For main we ordered the lamb and I had the steak. Just mouth watery awesomeness is all I can say about them both, go get yourself some!  Location was very strange and hard to find lol but otherwise everything else was perfect.  For dessert share a coconut cream pie! But also had a creme brulee too ! : )  You will not be disappointed, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend, and was definitely worth it. Started off with complimentary valet parking and coat check. My wife and I had the lobster appetizer (can't recall the name but refer to my photo). For main course I had the grilled filet mignon, one of the greatest steak dishes I ever had. Wife had the scallop dish, she loved it... I had a taste and it cooked nicely. Desert was coconut cream cake, was delicious, plenty to share for two . Great experience, and great city view"}
{"text":"Food: A+ Service: A+ Food presentation: A+ Atmosphere: A+ Prices: worth every penny! Recommended?:  Yes  Scaramouche is arguably the best high end restaurant in Toronto. I'm super picky about everything but I like everything about Scaramouche: 1. Location, location, location! Not really in the midst of crazy downtown but not really uptown either. It's in a pretty quite, in a little side street off Avenue Rd, in an area hidden from the rest of the city with a spectacular view of downtown Toronto.  2. Food is amazing. And forget the menu... you tell them what you want and how you want it and chances are they'll make it for you, and it will be better than what you had imagined. I had a lobster tail to start and then moved to a rack of lamb. Both fantastic!  3. Service, awesome! Very attentive, and quick even on a busy night, and as I mentioned they make what you want.   Yes, it is a bit on the expensive side but I'm not going to complain. It's worth every penny.  Bottom line, I highly recommend Scaramouche! 5 and a half star!"}
{"text":"This place takes the cake on having the most bizarre location ever. Situated at the bottom of an old apartment building, it's the last place you'd think a high-class restaurant would be. That being said, the restaurant has an amazing view of the city!  We came here with really high expectations. Unfortunately, I didn't think the food was phenomenal given how pricey it is. On top of that, our waiter was absolutely clueless when it came to giving us recommendations on wines. At the very least, he could have asked another staff member to help us. We have never felt so lost looking at a wine list!  Quebec Duck (foie gras terrine/duck pastrami/fig confit/pickled wild leeks/grapes/maple cider jelly/sourdough toast/vincotto) - This dish is on the heavier side. I could only eat a bit of the foie gras terrine. However, the grapes and jelly are a nice touch as they help lighten the dish up. Buffalo Mozzarella (avocado/asparagus/gem lettuces/lemon/green herb mayonnaise/lovage cress/toasted bread crumbs) - This was the best dish of the evening. Very light and the combination of lettuce with the mozzarella worked very well. Highly recommend. Lamb (roasted rack/salsa verde crust/whipped chickpeas/artichoke heart/rapini/meyer lemon/pine nuts) - Originally, we were going to order the partridge but got this dish instead on the recommendation of the waiter. This was nothing to write home about and I wouldn't get it again. Venison (bacon wrapped loin/sour cream spaetzle/candy cane beets/leeks/forelle pear/walnuts/watercress pesto/red wine jus/triple crunch mustard cream) - We were told that this would be cooked medium rare but it came out more as medium. Otherwise, I liked the bacon wrap because it was very thin and quite tasty! Coconut Cream Pie (white chocolate shavings/dark chocolate sauce) - We got this to go and it tasted great the next day. The best coconut dessert I've ever had (it helps that I'm a huge fan of white chocolate!). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went here for her birthday. Scaramouche was absolutely fabulous. This restaurant's food is scrumptious filled from start to finish. The appetizer, main and dessert were all very flavourful. We had the Ricotta Ravioli and Duck Pastrami for appetizer, both were delightful with sublime sauces. For our mains we had the Lamb and the Veal meals. The meats were exceptional; we could not choose between the two for our favourite because they were both beyond compare. We felt it took a bit long but once we tasted them, we realized that it was certainly worth the wait. Finally, for dessert, we had the ice-cream (house made rum-honeycomb) and the coconut cream pie. The cream pie came highly recommended and we were not disappointed, it lived up to our expectation and was definitely not too sweet. The ice-cream was one of the best I've ever had. The staff we interacted with (from the valet parking to the waiter) were extremely professional, welcoming and kind. The atmosphere (though not as great as some of the fancier downtown restaurants) was really pleasant and everyone seemed whisked away in a world of great flavour, dining and conversation. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at this majestic restaurant. Dinner for two was $220 (after taxes and tips, no alcohol)."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!!! What more can I say...yum lol"}
{"text":"Well we have to disagree with almost all the other reviewers. My husband and i were there for our anniversary and were totally disappointed.   First I had asked for a table with a view due to the anniversary and was instead led to a table on \"the dark side\" of the pasta bar right in the middle with no view at all.  When I asked the maitre d to move us, he said there were large parties in the \"bright\" room and we wouldn't be comfortable there. Well they weren't so large (6 people) and it would have been much better.  As for the food - utterly BORING and bland. Too conservative for us.  We had eaten the night before at a well reviewed restaurant on College and loved the creative food. The bread there was 3 types of artisanal bread fresh from their oven served with their own homemade tapenade.  At Scaramouche we got Hummus!  I have that in my fridge. At the other place there was a fabulous amuse bouche as well and truffles came with our bill. Finally, we were given 2 free glasses of champagne!  None of these extra touches appeared here, making it a forgettable instead of memorable experience. The bill at both places was identical!  A note about the food -  we ordered a side of mashed potatoes ($7) - I asked first if they had flavour, ie whipped garlicky - the server said they had a little parmesan in them.  My husband and I each took one bite and said we cannot eat this - tasted like paste, ie no taste at all.  We sent it back. The server had steered me towards ordering the haddock instead of seabass as it was more \"flavourful.\" I wonder what the seabass must be like as the haddock was no more flavourful than hospital food.  As for the coconut cream pie - it was good but so is the one we buy at Longo's. It's just coconut cream pie. (other place had a plum tatin with a red wine sauce - get the picture?).  Overall we felt we were eating at a senior's residence.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a foodie dream come true. It is true you get what you pay for. This restaurant will have your taste buds in a extraordinary adventure of pure pleasure. I have been to Scaramouche dinner restaurant twice and it was an incredible culinary experience. Thank you again Scaramouche for providing Toronto with such a delight! Also for dessert order the coconut cream pie ;)."}
{"text":"4.5 - experience, service and food  I came here as a surprise for my anniversary with my boyfriend, everybody was friendly, and genuine it felt. Our server was awesome, very laid back - but it felt like they were kind of pushing me to drink wine. Which I was not in the mood for. My boyfriend says the cocktails are very mediocre - flavoured vodka? really? It's easy to make your own infused vodkas or any other type of liquor...   Anyway, server assistant was AWESOME, she made me feel extra at ease - this was my first time fine dinning, and these aren't the types of places my boyfriend and I usually go to. I obviously felt out of place and awkward, but it got better as I was there.   FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! We got the raw tuna, truffled gnocchi, lobster salad, lamb, foie gras dish (forget what it's called) and the malpec oysters... they were HUGE and delicious! 12 of them racked up to 50 bucks, btw. Anyway, we ate our heart out and were SOOOO FULL and satisfied after our meal, we came home to keep telling each other how full we were. I still remember my experience there, and it was so great.   Also, my boyfriend got the coconut cream pie, and loved it. I tried it and didn't feel any way about it, it was just cream IMO. but that's just me, I know it's very famous for it's coconut cream pie, my bf was about to buy the whole pie.   Great food, great service, definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Just had my Bday dinner there at it was amazing, fantastic service, great menu selection and tasty food with attention to details"}
{"text":"Scaramouche is housed on a hill with a wall of windows along the south side showcasing a beautiful view of the city; in summer we time our reservation so that we can watch the sunset, unfortunately in the winter months that's a wee bit early for dinner.  The décor is understated and contemporary; crisp white tablecloths accented by grey velvet chairs and banquettes, allowing the focus to remain on chef Kith Froggett's beautiful food.  We were there a couple Friday's ago with a girlfriend of mine (just getting around to the review now).  We took two bottles from our cellar; the first a 2007 Williams Selyam Zinfandel and the second a 2003 Chateau D'Arche Sauternes to share with dessert.  Our meal opened with an amuse bouche of Kabocha Squash soup with candied hazelnuts, delicious.  I love the amuse bouche, it's like a little hello, welcome and thank you for dining with us from the chef.  My girlfriend started with the Quebec Duck, recommended by our server since she couldn't quite make up her mind; such is the case when everything on the menu makes your mouth water.  Hubby and I both chose the Dungeness Crab Ravioli to begin.  The duck plating was deconstructed and elegant with foie gras terrine, duck breast pastrami, pickled wild leeks, griotte cherries, brioche toast, port jelly, pomegranate molasses and French walnuts, it was exquisite.  Our crab ravioli was served with a pan seared scallop, mustard greens, bok choy, radish and an uni butter sauce; there was one ravioli but it was huge and there was no shortage of crab stuffing, excellent.  I followed with the Fresh Partidge; I like to try something different, that I can't get, or wouldn't order anywhere else when I'm at a good restaurant.  The other mains looked wonderful but for me this was unquestionably the standout.  The partridge was served with the roasted breast and a cripy leg confit precut (both were so succulent and tender they just fell apart), a large serving of pan-seared foie gras sat over a perfectly thin potato pancake all atop wild mushrooms, peal onions, fois gras jus and huckleberries.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I savoured every bite and would have licked the plate clean if there hadn't been a room full of other diners!  Hubby had the grilled Nova Scotia Lobster with Asian greens, shitake and honey mushrooms, coconut hurricane broth and ginger sesame mayonnaise; the lobster is served in it's tail but shelled so that you don't have to do any messy work, it was cooked to perfection.  The Steelhead Salmon was my girlfriends main choice, with toasted Nori tempura crust, sesame seeds, snap peas, Japanese eggplant, soya-braised shitake, scallions, coriander, soya-lime beurre blanc and fresh chillies; the salmon was flaky and juicy and although she says she doesn't usually finish her entrée her plate was left empty as well.  After all this we were certainly satisfied, but you don't go to Scaramouche and not have dessert....well I don't go to any good restaurant and not have dessert.  I'm also not a fan of sharing dessert, which I made clear to my husband very early in our relationship, within the first week or two maybe.  I had my heart set on the dessert that Scaramouche is famous for, the in house, from scratch Coconut Cream Pie!  This pie is so good that my husband bought a whole one for my birthday party a couple years ago.  Yes, you can pre-order them for take away; that's how popular this pie is.  As legend has it they attempted to take it off the menu many years ago but there was a revolt from the regular customers, and so to them I give my sincere gratitude.  The other desserts on the menu looked divine as well, the Honeycrisp Apple Kougin Amann in caramelized puff pastry with prune and Armagnac ice cream and apple cider reduction spoke to me, but I knew I would have dessert envy if I didn't have my coconut cream pie.  And so it was, in all it's glory, the coconut cream like whipped clouds piled several inches high on the lightest flakiest crust that you'd swear it was puff pastry all topped with a generous portion of shaved white chocolate.  Luscious, scrumptious, HEAVEN!  It was only my girlfriend that strayed from the pie, choosing the Manjari Chocolate Cremeux on top a chocolate macaron with coffee ice cream and a chocolate tuile which was so tasty hubby said he would likely order this next time.  Usually we ask our servers name, but we seemed to neglect this last night, which was too bad because she was excellent.  I would like to be seated in her section again.  She was warm, attentive, and had a good sense of humor; we like to have fun when we go for dinner so we tend to joke around with the servers a bit.  We find too often that people who go out to nicer restaurants are stuffy and treat the staff sort of secondary, but we like to make our servers part of our experience, that's part of the fun for us and I think that's why we always get fantastic service.  5 Starts Excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to be only giving 3 stars as I wanted to find 'the' restaurant to have our anniversary dinners.   We shared an appetizer and it was okay.  We both ordered the partridge: With which we found to be very dry. The breast was almost not edible.  The vegetables on the side were too salted.  The redemption was the dessert. Their menu changes so we always order the chocolate dessert with ice cream. Shout outs to the pastry chef as it was excellent: Burst in your mouth experience.   Maybe it was a busy night? We had to wait 20 mins to get our mains and the server switched on us but we didn't know so we kept flagging down the wrong person.   It was an enjoyable night but we wouldn't be back as the quality of their food seems to be inconsistent.   The ambiance is very old shool although well kept. The food scene in Toronto has gotten a lot better over the past 2 years.   I definatly have many other options for the amount of money I'm paying to dine here."}
{"text":"Incredible service, beautiful food. Simple decor.   Our meals were awesome... we had the pasta appetizer (amazing!) and the lobster..and partridge (just ok) and mother had the halibut (fabulous!)...   I do have to say though, the coconut cream pie I felt was a little overrated. My mother ordered the mango almond tart and quite frankly that was more impressive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Always a big winner in my books!  Sitting at the bar and eating with a friend is one of my favourite pastimes.   Can't recommend this place enough. Just be prepared to pay more than usual. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The room is quietly understated. All the better to focus on your guests and food. The service is friendly yet unobtrusive. The food pure heaven. A very high level of French style in its discipline but with great flavours from around the world. Simply, a great place."}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant for a special occasion. I have had the pleasure of dining here twice and this is by far the best all round for food, service and view.  Scaramouche is tucked away in a residential area of forest hill located in the lower level of an apartment building. There is complimentry valet and coat check as well. The staff is always polite friendly and it doesn't feel like a \"stuffy\" environment. I would recommend getting a table by the window if you are celebrating a special occasion -you get a nice view of the Toronto sky line.  The seafood is outstanding and dessert is a must. The coconut cream pie has a wonderful crust and light coconut cream with dark chocolate drizzle. Also tried the chocolate dessert and both were winners. I can't sing enough praises about this restaurant and will definatly be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The decor is a bit dated, but the gorgeous view of the city stole my attention. This restaurant is the perfect place to impress a date or even a client. It's quite pricey, but it's definitely well worth it.  I had the Yellowfin Tuna to start and it was absolutely delicious and full of flavour. For my main I had the steelhead salmon that came with the crispiest, most delicious skin I have ever had. For dessert I had the Honeycrisp Apple Kouign Aman, which was the perfect way to end the meal. It was crispy and buttery, and not too sweet. This was definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten. No morsel went to waste. I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Toronto.  Have not had a bad meal here. I prefer the casual vibe of the pasta bar and I love the Peppercorn Fettucine pasta and the seafood dish.  The staff is very accommodating so even if you are sitting in the past bar but request something from the more formai dinning room menu they will not refuse - like the spicy steak tartar or the sea scallops.    I love this place! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Known to be one of the best restaurants in Toronto, this was a very good spot for a business dinner. I could also see it as a good romantic dinner place too.    Food was very good, but I feel I am spoiled in San Francisco with fine dining, especially if this is one of the best Toronto has to offer.   Location was the most interesting part. From the outside, the building looks like a college dormitory. Once inside the door, a nicely contemporary restaurant reveals itself with a view of the city."}
{"text":"Located in an older apartment building, I was surprised that Google Maps took us here, since it seemed like an odd place for an upscale restaurant! And when we were led down a set of stairs to the dining room, again I was surprised since I knew Scaramouche had a spectacular view of the city (but she was leading us DOWN the stairs!). This place is just full of surprises!  The restaurant was really busy, which wasn't surprising given it was a Saturday night. However, it was a bit louder than I expected in the dining room which sort of took away a bit from the romantic atmosphere.  When we made a reservation, I requested a table with a view. We weren't seated right next to the window, but one table away. We noticed that the couple next to us with the window view were regulars, since they ordered the \"usual\" and the gentleman had pre-ordered something. They definitely got the special treatment this evening. Oh well!  Anyways onto the food...I started with the spicy steak tartare - hand-cut filet mignon/garlic crostini/watercress ($18). Not very spicy, but really delicious! Some of the best steak tartare I've had. It was so flavourful I really didn't need any of the sauce surrounding it.  My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli - cauliflower/spinach/honey mushrooms/double smoked bacon white wine sauce ($22). This dish came with one large stuffed ravioli. Again, another fantastic appetizer. So far, so good!  For my main, I ordered the duck - roasted breast/confit leg/grilled sausage/mustard greens apple whipped parsnip/red wine reduction/Meyer lemon chutney ($39). I enjoyed the confit leg the best. The skin was nice and crisp while the meat was tender and moist. The only thing I didn't finish on my plate was the grilled sausage, which had a very off-putting taste to it, which I can't pinpoint. Not a fan.  My boyfriend's main was the red wine braised beef shortribs - ricotta gnocchi/Brussels sprout leaves/baby white turnip hedgehog mushrooms/whipped fresh horseradish ($37). The shortribs were really tender and tasty. The gnocchi were extremely cheesy if you like them that way... me, not so much.  We ended with their famous coconut cream pie. Even for a person who doesn't like coconut, I really enjoyed this! For those of you interested, I noticed on the menu that they also sell whole cream pies for take-out!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most expensive and most precious dining plate for us to digest in a while. There's complimentary valet parking, and you go down-stairs to get seated. We were a party of 6. I noted to the maitre'd that it was a special bday for my gf a few days prior, and would think that the server would be informed, but to my letdown, he wasn't aware, til I hinted once in the beginning and once in the end of our meal...A little disappointed in the execution there...  We started with two apps, two mains, two drinks, and one dessert...  Tempura Squash Blossoms ($25)- Filled with King crab, lemon and buffalo ricotta, edamame puree, zucchini and small herbs. - For TWO pieces the size of your index finger, along with some bit of sauce, and bit of garnish. Tasted a bit of crab, but not too filling as they've mentioned. Plating is nice though.  Spicy Steak Tartare ($22)- Hand cut tenderloin with spicy caper, mustard and egg dressing. Garlic crostini and watercress garnish. - This in my opinion is the better app, however, portion are still quite small, but its fine dining. I didn't taste that much spice though, its quite mild.  Lamb ($48)- rack with crispy mustard crust, swiss chard, pickled curry cherry tomatoes and carrot puree. Spicy eggplant relish and toasted walnut bread crumbs on natural jus. - This is nicely cooked spot on. About 5 to 6oz worth of meat. Nicely plated. Flavour is good. This is probably one of their signature dishes!  Grilled Seafood ($49)- Half tail lobster, grilled octopus, two scallops, mussels w/o shells, tuscan style white beans braised with saffron, herbs, and fine olive oil. Fennel, tomato, and grilled chili. - I like some of the seafood. It was cooked nicely. The octopus was a bit chewy. The lobster was alright, the scallops were cooked the best among the seafood. I didn't really care for the white beans, its a cheap product used to fill you a bit. The sauce base tasted a bit strong on the lemon or lime side.  Dessert (Raspberry Tart-$14)- vanilla ganache, raspberry lychee sorbet, pistacchio brittle. - My gf didn't really like it that much. I thought it was okay.  So...To re-iterate about reminders on bday. I mentioned in the beginning to the Server, make this special bday lady a nice cocktail that the bartender can come up with, something fruity and not too strong on the alcohol...'Sex on the beach'! FAILED  I recall the maitre'd mentioned about bday they would provide complimentary dessert of some regard, but the server again was oblivious, and had I known, I would have ordered their popular dessert. Nevertheless, I pre-ordered their 'coconut pie' $50+ and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Service is great, b/c they have assistance throughout the service, providing bread, water refill, plate change, cutlery change. This is the usual standard for higher fine dine experience. This is definitely a splurgy experience $300 for two ppl. They don't split bill for parties...  I would come back just for something else next time, and the view is nice by the window, however, only on a very special occasion.  P/S: I heard their washroom is quite nice...=P"}
{"text":"It's a little overrated. Good service, but the food was only OK. Scallop was great, steak was average, and the fries was just terrible..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself there. Dishes I ordered are: foie gras - I love to eat foie gras and this one is good. but it is a little bit too much. I finished the foie gras and felt full after this first course. duck - I generally like it but not that special coconut cream pie - it has been recommended by so many people and is actually the one that I expected most. maybe because i am already very full after the main course or because of the high expectation, the coconut flavor and the crispy pie is appeealing but I just didn't finish it.  there is a beautiful view of the outside, especially if you sit near the window. and yes it becomes a little bit noisy from around 7pm."}

{"text":"Fabulous food, presentation & service, lovely view, superb winelist....what more can I say? My boyfriend took me there on my birthday.  The lobster appetizer had sold out but that was no problem because everythig on the menu was appealing.   I decided on 2 appetizers instead of a main.  We enjoyed a wonderful 2005 burgundy which is not easy  to come by!   The dessert menu is fun to read...and I am sure all their desserts are devine.....but i don't eat dessert!"}
{"text":"By far, the best filet mignon I've ever had. It is truly in a league of its own. I made my girlfriend try a bite and she instantly regretted ordering the pasta (don't get the pasta btw) I can't stop promoting this restaurant. I also highly recommend the homemade coconut cream pie. A perfect ending to a perfect meal"}
{"text":"Although the restaurant doesn't look nearly as fancy as some of the other fine dining establishments in the city, the food and service is definitely worthy of praise.   Standouts for me were the yellowfin tuna sashimi and the halibut.  Wonderful flavours and beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend takes me to this place on special occasions and it has quickly become my all-time favourite (that is saying a lot, since I have eaten at many places)  The outside of this place looks like a joke, but the valet service is always great, and when you go inside you get a view of downtown Toronto from the windows, and is very quiet and classy.   Food....can I just get to the food? A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Hands down, worth every penny. I have tried several dishes there and every bite left me speechless. Service is superb, and it they change the menu here and there with daily specials so you can always try something different.   If you are looking for a full-course meal here with drinks, you are looking to spend around $350 for two people."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin to say how much I enjoy this restaurant.  It is by far one of the best spots to eat in the world.  Service is fantastic, very attentive and yet not in your face.   Food is sublime, and the location is very unique.  Viewing the city is fantastic from this vantage point.  The condo building it is in, is an older building in the city which has been retrofitted very tastefully inside, it reminds me of an older Manhattan building, but done with much taste."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is as good as it gets in Toronto. Amazing ambience, wonderful view and a perfect menu. The scallops are my goto. Just done to perfection and simply unrivaled in Toronto. Even the price considering the quality and location is very reasonable. And finally the service is great, our waitress went totally out of her way to explain the whole menu and really go through what Scaramouche had to offer."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best fine dining restaurant in Toronto. For this type of dining, prices are not crazy, and the food is amazing. They even have people come by to scrape crumbs off your table which at first is completely uncomfortable... but after you realize you're spending 100$+ a person it is easy to settle into a posh mindset and enjoy the fact that someone's whole job is to scrape crumbs off your table.  For vegetarians, this place does not sacrifice. I can not explain enough how frustrating it is that with so many fine dining establishments, they all do a risotto as their vegetarian dish... so sick of JUST having risotto as an option! Depending on what version of the menu they are serving during the year, their are a few really well thought out dishes. There is a veggie menu you can request at the restaurant that is not online by the way.  Last I went, I had a potato dish that was layered with goat cheese, and a mushroom/truffle pasta. Both were exceptional. Lots of good drinks and cocktails as well. To end it off, had to try the coconut cream pie, it was heaven and I can see why they sell it by the pie.  All in all amazing food and service. I have not been to the Pasta Bar, only the restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for the food, and the coconut cream pie!  The pasta bar offers a few different dishes than the regular dining menu. Both menus are great, it depends on what you prefer. You can always check out their updated menus on their website before you head to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even more amazing service.   Went to Scaramouche to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I got the Lobsterlicious prix fixe meal, while he got the Quebec Duck as a starter and the Elk as the entree. The dishes were delicious and we especially enjoyed the foie gras that was part of the Quebec Duck dish. For an additional $5, we were able to \"upgrade\" the dessert (included as part of the prix fixe menu) to the coconut cream pie. Scaramouche's coconut cream pie was heavenly, with just the right balance of coconut, custard, and cream. The shaved white chocolate on top was DIVINE.  I must mention that our waiter, upon hearing me mention that it was my boyfriend's birthday, went out of his way to ask the kitchen to add a special \"Happy Birthday\" message on the edge of the dessert plate. The coconut cream pie was served with the birthday message, which was written using chocolate sauce, along with a lit up birthday candle. Simply AMAZING service - the small gesture made us feel very special and well taken care of."}
{"text":"By far, the best coconut cream pie i have ever had in my life....and I have had a lot of coconut cream pie! It is pretty upscale with a beautiful view of the CN tower. The crowd is a bit \"older\", meaning age 70+. It is located at the bottom of the seniors home. The service was excellent and the food was one of the best."}
{"text":"1 word. Lobsterlicious.   If you missed it this year, be sure to go make reservations next year. I was treated to dinner here for my birthday and it happened to fall during their Lobsterlicious special. We made a reservation in the dining room by the window (too bad we were in the middle of a snow storm, couldn't see too much). The atmosphere was nice and cozy and the fact that there's no strictly enforced dress code was great (not that you want to go dressed as a slob but a nice pair of jeans and a dressy top is very passable).   On to the food! Of course, my boyfriend (G) and I both ordered off the Lobsterlicious prix fix menu. I adore lobster, my boyfriend, not so much but he was willing to try it. I ordered the scallop & lobster risotto, poached lobster with garlic mushroom polenta and had their famous coconut cream pie for dessert. G had the spicy lobster bisque, steamed lobster with potato gnocchi and creme brulee. Oh and a glass of white each.  The lobster risotto and the lobster bisque... to die for. I'm not sure which one I would order the next time we go back. They were both really well prepared and delicious.   We both really liked our entrees, except I think we would have swapped our choices. The polenta was really on the filling side for me, especially after the risotto starter. The 1 & 1/4 pound lobster was de-shelled and cooked extremely well... soft and flavourful. The polenta was really rich and yummy, but I needed some help from G to finish it off.   And dessert? The coconut cream pie was 3 inches high and the slice was nearly the size of my head. Okay, slight exaggeration but huge nonetheless. And coconutty! Again, needed G's help to finish that off too.   Great upscale restaurant, great service, and amazing food. Absolutely no complaints and a delectably satisfied tummy afterward. Fantastic way to celebrate a birthday!"}
{"text":"Been here for the lobsterlicious menu. Absolutely delicious and good amount of lobster in all dishes. Service was excellent. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Upon my most recent visit I noticed the management has removed the florescent lighting which I had found so egregious. As I said in my original review, This was an extraordinary restaurant with the one large shortcoming. Well now this is simply an extraordinary restaurant and I've updated my rating to five stars to reflect such.     The cuisine crafted here is truly cerebral and well planned. I'm always astonished how each element or component on the plate - and often they are  plentiful- all work so well off each other. Many of the pairings and combinations are classical, but some are truly inspired. Everyone nowadays accuses older chefs of \"overthinking\" their food, but I don't think it's possible. This kind of careful cooking shows so richly in the final product. Truly, la cuisine soignee.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The food here is extraordinary. I've been to - what in my opinion are the only other restaurants in the city that rival Scaramouche's cuisine and I would still say it's not possible to find this caliber of food anywhere else in Toronto. The quality of the food in both concept and execution is comparable to a one star Michelin restaurant. I've eaten here several dozen times, with different people and its always a safe bet for food.   As amazing as the food is, the decor is not. For the most part the center of the dining room is fine and along the window optimal. However there is the most sickening, stomach churning florescent lighting along the back wall. If you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH that foul lighting....well it's tremendously unpleasant. I don't know who's genius idea it was to put florescent lighting in a fine dining establishment. Furthermore I truly can't  comprehend why anyone would then decide to place tables directly underneath that lighting! Florescent lighting belongs in the back of the house, if anywhere. To reiterate, florescent lighting should NEVER be in a formal dining room! Can I stress this point anymore? Perhaps, if it wasn't for this shortcoming, I would have given the restaurant five stars.   Now that I'm done ranting, I'd like to add that the service is good, not to Michelin or classical french standards, but none the less very good. I will continue to dine here every time I'm in town and quite possibly every night I'm in town, providing I'm seated away from the offensive lighting. Ultimately this is a truly excellent restaurant with one big shortcoming."}
{"text":"Great service go for pasta bar downstairs as similar amazing food at lower prices! Great salads Beef Sago awesome and filling Salmon is great Coconut cream pie best ever. Valet parking a nice touch!"}
{"text":"It was definitely a superb experience.  I went there in Oct with my husband for my birthday. The food's taste and quality were definitely of top-notch. The server was very professional and friendly.  we were seated by the window and the view overseeing downtown enhanced the dining experience even more. By dessert time, we wree so full already after the 2 courses. Given the infamous coconut pie of this place, I still had to order it and no regrets.  I think might be the best coconut pie I have ever had -- fraiche creme, the coconut shreds....omg. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to the hype - however, it is a bit of an older, stuffier crowd. Doesn't help it is attached to an 'old folks home'. If you are looking for young and hip - do not go - but if you are trying to impress your girlfriend's parents, boom!"}
{"text":"I was having trouble deciding what to rate this place.  I'll start with the positives:  1) Incredible service I'm not usually one to comment on service, but at a place like this you can't help but comment on it. They make you feel like royalty surrounded by loyal servants who know their job well and perform it with dignity and grace  2) Solid food You get the feeling they have been making the same dishes forever and have perfected everything, but sometimes forget to step back and review each dish as if for the first time.  First they brought an amuse-bouche of sardines that was one of the best parts of the meal. I don't usually like sardines, but the merging of flavours was impeccable.  For an appetizer we shared the yellow fin tuna tartar. Subtle flavours with very fresh tuna.  For mains we had the filet mignon and the venison. My venison was cooked very well, although I found the mustard was used a little too liberally on the plate. It overwhelmed the other subtle tastes at times.  Finally, we got the infamous coconut cream pie for dessert. It was the best I've ever had, bar none.  3) Great view Most tables can look south through the floor-to-ceiling windows towards the downtown core. Beautiful as the sun sets.   There aren't really any specific negatives, except a nagging feeling that I could have spent this amount of money on another restaurant and gotten something more unique. Maybe it's just my desire for more modern fare, but I left the restaurant wondering if they could be doing more.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion with a very safe meal that will be exactly as good as you expect."}
{"text":"I'm a hugh fan of the Pasta Bar..sit at the bar watching the boys and girls cooking away...fun fun..the views behind you are great as are the ones in from....eat drink and be merry...OH and for god sakes  eat the coconut cream pie.YUM YUM YUM"}
{"text":"From the amuse bouche through dessert everything is flawless. Friendly, attentive staff. Perfectly executed food. There isn't a miss on the menu - you can't go wrong no matter what you order. There is a reason Kates has named it the city's best 3 years running. Be warned though - reservations are a must and well in advance. Try to get a seat near the widow!"}
{"text":"Called in advance to secure a quiet table and received a great one on arrival, with an amazing view of the skyline at night, we even got lucky enough to see some fireworks at the end. The ambience and decor here are incredible.  I'm a sucker for a great amuse-bouche, and they delivered with a great piece of salmon.  For apps we did the calamari and steak tartare, calamari just being \"ok\" but the steak tartare was a standout and I highly recommend it.  They offered an off the menu cavatelli pasta app which they split for us which was also very good. I was extremely excited for the swordfish special I ordered but it could have been more moist on the inside and I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with it. I tried some of the veal sirloin which was wonderfully cooked.   On to dessert!! Coconut cream pie, wow. and The dark chocolate mousse double wow! They were definitely a few more places in Toronto I wanted to try but with only 3 days I couldn't do it all, so overall I'd say this was my best dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food, nice atmosphere. Scallops was delicious. Valet parking. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the view was beautiful.  Service, impeccable.  All in all, expensive but good value for the money."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Simply the best food and service I've ever experienced.    As soon as you step into the restaurant, you are greeted with a friendly hostess.  Was here during the lobster deal but I also ordered fois gras to start, followed with a steak.    While we waited for our food, we were served with complimentary salad that was very well presented and very refreshing.  The fois gras is toasted to perfection and very delicious to say the least.  The steak was not the best I have had but definitely top notch.    The waiter was very courteous and helpful when it came to wine selections.  Made sure our table was clean, cups are filled, and served the courses accordingly and timely.  Hats off to the restaurant for hiring such professional staffs who are not just pretty faces.  The furnitures and decor are a little dated but provided a very comfortable setting.  You won't feel pretentious and patrons seem to be really relaxed without the snobby feeling you would find at other restaurants that tries to be high class.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone couple that are celebrating something but making frequent visits could be a little too rich for many's blood.  Either way, you will not be disappointed.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant I have ever been to in Toronto. All dishes that I had there were simply fabulous, nothing short of spectacular in terms of both taste and presentation. Service was impeccable, as all waiters were very professional and attentive which made it a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"One food critic recently speculated that if Michelin rated Toronto restaurants, Scaramouche would get at least one if not more stars.  I've recently had a chance to dine in a well known 3-star French restaurant in Napa Valley, and although the meal was truly spectacular, I have to say that the one I recently had at Scaramouche was more satisfying.  (At a third of the price.)  French cuisine is about perfect technique, not pushing boundaries, so don't expect mind-blowing originality or French/Sechuan fusion.  You won't be served octopus foam and nothing will be frozen in liquid nitrogen. What you will get is impeccable quality, a lot of thought put into each dish and a touch of that \"je ne sais quoi\".Take a humble tomato salad.  Served on an oblong plate, it starts with a little pear-shaped tomato on one end, then a larger green one and a succession of different varieties, sliced this way and that, all sprinkled with toasted almond crumbs.  In the middle of the plate sits a puck of Manchego cheese-flavoured panna cotta.  Then you continue your journey to the other end of the plate where, waiting for you, is another green tomato and a little one shaped like a pear.  A perfect story arc, except that the story is told in tomatoes.  Their steak tartar has a wonderful (chopped, not ground) texture and a perfect flavour. Lamb is served in two preparations: as boneless rack and leg, on a trendy smear of potatoes (whipped, not mashed).  The partridge came out crisp and juicy, both dark and white meat.  Whole paragraphs have been written here about Scaramouche's coconut cream pie, which the restaurant has been serving for the last 28 years, so it doesn't need me to sing its praises.  I found it not too sweet (the way I like desserts) and actually refreshing, which you don't expect from coconut, or cream, or pie.  The restaurant has an 80s ambiance, but it doesn't feel tacky or dated.  It shows that  when it was first built, no expense was spared to make it classy and timeless.    Scaramouche isn't a family restaurant and it isn't perfect for a casual Friday night with friends. (Unless your friends are rich and you book well in advance.)  Located all by itself, in a residential neighbourhood, it attracts diners with a purpose.  Perfect for a small celebration, or just a celebration of French cuisine, it's one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving poor reviews but I just don't get it with this place.  The service is outstanding but the food is bland.  I had the peppercorn fettuccini and it fell flat.  Their coconut cream pie is also dissapointing and bland.  For that price head over to Mistura or Morton's."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great staff, reasonable prices I recommend to try Filet Mignon with lil red wine Chateau Margaux Classe goes very good"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restos in the City. Flawless execution of dishes and exemplary service.  Every dinner there is special. They deliver consistently every single time. I have eaten there 6-10 times, and I always leave wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great except the other restaurant guest. I have never eaten somewhere & felt so uncomfortable with all the staring & whispering going on. I am from Florida & maybe there is such a thing as Southern Hospitality. The servers were very kind & friendly as well as knowledgable. The food was delicious! We had the lobster bisque soup. The gnocchi app & we each had the lobster as our main course which was wonderful. Of course, thanks to all the reviews about the coconut pie we had that too & it was all that people have made it out to be & more! Save room for the pie people! I can't fault the restaurant for their rude guest therefore this place gets 5 stars. I walked out with a full & happy stomach but an uncomfortable vibe!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant. The food is amazing and the service is fantastic. I loved their quails and it was my most favourite dish but they have recently removed that :(  The only bad experience i had was a couple of years ago when we decided to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday there. I called ahead of time and brought them a bottle of rare wine we had brought with us from South Africa so they could open it and let it breath prior to dinner. I personally spoke to the sommelier and discussed it with him. But when we got there for dinner I noticed they hadn't opened our bottle that they so insisted I bring hours prior to dinner. But all in all it is a fantastic restaurant with great food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was a great place to take my fiancé for birthday dinner. She's a big fan of Italian, but I wanted to treat her to something different by introducing her to french cuisine.   The atmosphere was pleasant - perfect for a romantic night out. The view from the dining room was phenomenal, a great topic of discussion and a nice place to take a picture in front of.   The waiting staff was polite, present, and open to requests.  The wine list was extensive - a broad range of grapes varying in prices from affordable to a little pricier.   The best part of all was the food. Perfect portions and great attention to detail. We loved the truffle fries dessert!   I would definitely go back for a special occasion - not something for everyday outings. Unless you're ballin like that.   Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 - 4 stars for the food 5+ stars for the service.  I visited Toronto for my girlfriend's birthday and had her birthday dinner here. I had asked for a window table and also told them it was her birthday and the restaurant executed this perfectly. I was impressed by the service and in my opinion top notch. The only fault is that it doesn't quite compare to the quality of food in NYC."}
{"text":"They lay it down right at the 'Mouche.   I have been here three times in about three years. Everytime I love the decor (which is like a magical time capsule to a land where Mordecai Richler and Patrick Bateman might both be at home), and the service (which is friendly but more polished than it is warm).   What I really love is the food, though. The 80's decor might be the beginning of the trip, but the food...that's like...the end of the trip."}
{"text":"This is a stalwart of the Toronto fine dining community. It's been around for thirty years and has a solid reputation among the professional and middle aged well-heeled crowd. Joanne Kates, food critic at the Globe and Mail consistently names this place as number 1 in Toronto.   So needless to say, I've only been here with my parents. The coconut cream pie was OK and the filet mignon was simple yet delicious. Cleaned my plate.  The decor is a bit dated and the view was blocked by trees. But it's cosy and small. Service was super attentive and a bit amusing to watch the young waiter put on his best sophisticated waiter act."}
{"text":"View is awesome and the food is even better! Had the trio of goat cheese (one of which felt like a pillow in my mouth) sea bass (portion large enough to split), coconut cream pie (heaven) and pistachio meringue (AWESOME!). Wine list was great and satisfied my Italian friend.  This place is a definite must!"}
{"text":"The view was very nice and romantic! The best thing we both had was the mushroom soup. The lamb was good but the spicy/pickled eggplant threw me off. The service was also good, we were served on time and water was refreshed."}
{"text":"Reasonable food in a beautifully decorated restaurant. Service could be better but this place does get very busy at lunch times!"}
{"text":"Forget flowers and chocolate, show her how much you care by ordering her a giant slice of coconut cream pie the size of her head.  I wish my boyfriend read my Yelp reviews. Do you see this review? Hint?  Pie? Me?  Anyways, I bought myself pie and I'll buy it again. Now that I've already talked about dessert, I should start from the beginning.  I had a hard time finding the entrance of this restaurant.  I saw a sign on Avenue Road but you have to access the restaurant from the small residential street. It's bizarre that the restaurant is basically attached to an apartment building. They have valet parking? Really? Because I parked on the street.  The decor is pleasant, simple, but conservative.  I also found the vibe a bit stuffy and older.  There were a few groups having business dinners here...or older people that like to wear suits and have dinner.  Surprisingly, not as many people on dates as expected -- except one older gent with a hired lady friend.  There is a great view of the city (request a seat by the window), but it's not the most romantic place I've been.  But give me more pie and martinis and I might change my mind.  To start I had the foie gras terraine ($28).  The chilled foie was served with toasty bread.  I'll be honest, I've had better.  I found the sourdough toast over-crunchy and the foie was stiff and slightly too cold and wasn't overly flavorful.  It was garnished nicely with sweet maple cider jelly and fig confit..  I ordered the scallops and shortribs Bourguignonne ($41).  It was a creative entree deconstructed, the scallops were perfectly seared and juicy, the de-boned short ribs were fall apart soft.  The smoked bacon gnocci was good, but the sauce overpowered any bacon flavours.    I'm going to talk about dessert a second time.. just because it's THAT good. I ordered the coconut cream pie ($13) that everyone talks about. Layers and layers of light, fluffy cream, with a bit of coconut, crispy buttery bottom.  Everyone at the table was full. Most people left some pie on the plate. ...I sure didn't!   One of the top 10 things I've put in my mouth. ...And, you can actually buy full pies to take home.  The food was excellent. The service was super excellent. Overall, I had a wonderful dinner here and I'll be back. =D"}
{"text":"I came here twice in 2 weeks. I tried half butter poached lobster ( the sauce is absolutely delicious), foie gras, foie gras terrine (a beautiful presented appetizer) and Quebec venison, sturgeon, duck breast and lobster. I found the portion is rather big for each dish. Every dish was delicious! Scaramouche is now one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. The vibe is not too serious. And they have the best coconut cream pie I've ever tried! I love finishing the meal with a nice piece of pie and some coffee. It's simply heaven. Oh, plus, the view is amazing."}
{"text":"I decided to try Scaramouche for our anniversary and I couldn't be happier. We arrived at 6:30 and the place was pretty empty, but I made a reservation just in case and they gave us a nice table by the window(make sure you ask for it when you call). 1. View: you'll be surprised, because the restaurant is at the lower level of the building, and you can see all of downtown and the CN Tower. 2. Interior: The restaurant is really nice.  It was a little dim and not so loud which was a great plus for me. It's subjective to measure how romantic a restaurant is, but in that aspect I think it could have been a little better. 3.Service was on the level and really professional. The wait staff was polite and always there if you need them. I feel like that's how service should be in any restaurant. 4. I can really talk a lot about the food. The lobsterlicious menu is a great option and if you like lobster you should definitely take it. We ordered one plus I got the Roasted Sea Bass. I heard good things about the fish and wasn't let down. The Poached Lobster in particular was so delicious. I got pretty full from all the food and for dessert we just shared one coconut cream pie which is exactly as everyone says: amazing! They give you three kinds of bread with butter. Each kind has it's own unique taste. I really liked the dark bread. Should mention that the butter was fresh out of the fridge and a little hard.  I'd give it  solid 4.5 stars, because I just expected a little bit more from the interior, and for the price, which means It's not your everyday restaurant. On the other hand the food was so good I'm really tempted to go back again."}
{"text":"We went for a firm dinner and I was a little annoyed that it was so out of the way from downtown Toronto.. but now. Worth the trip.   The location is absolutely great. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a group of condos which makes it a great destination spot. There's a fantastic view of downtown Toronto.   The courses were amazing a surprisingly very filling. My filet mignon came with three cuts, and I was very, very full after the meal. The sides (mushrooms and potatoes) were also very outstanding."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Scaramousche and decided to try it.  What a big disappointment!!!  It was pricy, so-so food, terrible service!  It puzzles me how this restaurant has 4stars rating.  I personally would never go back there.  If you are looking for a good restaurant, try Splendido."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time. Highly flavourful which was the best part.  I'm often disappointed when I can't find vegetarian options, but I was not disappointed here. Was so impressed that I am definitely booking a return visit. It is fairly pricey at somewhere around $80-$90 per person,  but is good for a visit on and location.   They have a great view of downtown Toronto. The ambience is very nice and the presentation of the food was also pleasing."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  My husband took me here for my Birthday dinner and we loved every moment of it.  I was a little concerned given the location - which seems unusual, but what a hidden gem!  The view is spectacular, the food and service were amazing and although it is pricey, I definitely feel as if it was worth the cost (which isn't always the case as you know)."}
{"text":"Had my mother's 60th birthday dinner here. Amazing view, great service and the food was spectacular. Venison was duper tender, it melted in your mouth. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the wait staff were very attentive. Great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, one of the best in town! We had foie gras and daily soup to start. We were offered the amuse for appetizer as well. Loved my venison dish so much, the meat was very juicy and tender! My friend ordered the partridge, was awesome as well! Definitely had an amazing experience here!"}
{"text":"Two words- blown away. The food, the staff, the ambience... You pay for the experience here.  We came on a Friday night (surprised there was still availabilities left last minute). Service was a bit slow, but reasonable considering it was a Friday night and the place was packed. Every dish we ordered was amazing. I loved the venison; my bf loved the lamb. Highly recommend those dishes.  The star of the show however was the coconut cream pie. They aren't kidding when they say it's one of the best desserts in the city!  Perfect spot for a date, if you're willing to splurge a night. Tip: ask to be seating near the window. The view of Toronto is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying a meal with two friends at Scaramouche pasta bar during my last trip to Toronto.   Scaramouche has consistently been ranked as one of top restaurants in Toronto, so I had high expectations.   The service was impeccable. Friendly, timely and professional.   The food was delicious. I had oysters, followed by a veal burger (no bun) with frites. So good!!  To complete our meal my friends and I shared a cheese plate.   The cocktails were delicious and the wine menu was good.   So far it'd be a 4/5, but then there's the view. The best!!! The full Toronto skyline is in view from the dining room. Amazing. It is the service & view that really make this a standout restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Disappointing requested a window table for our 25th wedding anniversary.  We were told they were all reserved.  1.5 hour dinner and watched two window tables go empty for the evening."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. although somewhat noisy.  First we were served an amuse bouche of smoked salmon concoction which was delicious. Our group of three had foie gras terrine and oysters for appetizer, and they were excellent. The oysters were flavorful, and although I prefer fresh foie gras,  the terrine together with the garnish and sauce and brioche was uniquely satisfying.  The main courses we had were baked Atlantic cod, tuna, and lamb.  The fish was delicately done, and cooked just right, as was the lamb which was succulent and flavorful and rare as I had ordered.  The desserts of creme brulee  and ice cream were also excellent.  The service was outstanding, and the wine by the glass recommended by the waiter to accompany the lamb was just right.  Overall, a memorable experience and we will certainly come back here our next trip to Toronto (or even once more during this stay), Located in a residential area, our probably inexperienced taxi driver had some trouble finding the place."}
{"text":"Maybe more of a 4.2   I don't really have any complaints to be honest. I took my bestfriend here for an early dinner on a Friday night. Service was super (almost not used to it) attentive. We had the veal, filet mignon and Parmesan fries to share. The amuse-bouche was wild smoked salmon and it a really nice start to the meal. The cheese in the veal dish was super complimentary and made the whole dish a lot better. We kinda felt like the filet mignon tasted more like brisket though. My favourite thing hands down was the super cheesy Parmesan fries. I wasn't disappointed with their food at all, I thought the cost was justified with the view, the service, and the meal. However, was my mind blown with how good the food was?  No it really wasn't, it was definitely good but like another reviewer had said, nothing is really innovative, and it was more on the mediocre side. Still, I think it's worth coming here for dates or special occasions."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to finally try Scaramouche mostly because of its odd location. Everything from the valet, coat check, server and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with possibly the best pasta for the price on the planet while enjoying some of the best view of the city. the service is equally outstanding. parking is somewhat challenging here so probably best to arrive by cab if you can, although it is also doable to take the subway and get on/off at summerhill. I will be back to this restaurant over and over again."}
{"text":"Came here for my b-day last year for Lobsterlicious and it was fab.  The 3 course fix menu was amazing.  The place itself was kinda tricky to find at first as it is in the lower floor of this building that looks to be a residential building, I wouldn't be surpise if it was as I show people on their balcony just hanging out.  The view at Scarmouche is amazing as you can get a clear view of the CN tower.  The service was good and came to check up on you."}
{"text":"As one of Toronto's best restaurants, my experience was nothing short of exceptional. Every course was strong by fine dining standards, with each possessing elegance, superlative taste, and finesse. I think it necessary to give special recognition to the desserts, which transcended all of my fine dining experiences in the past. Desserts are usually where fine dining restaurants come short, as it is difficult to triumph the delectable simplicities of regular desserts with one that is both delicious and innovatively complex at the same time. My dessert played with a variety of textures, temperatures, and acidities. The wow factor was the pop rocks, which were incorporated into the dessert and gave me a pleasant yet delicate surprise. Service was also excellent and there was free valet parking. Further, the view from the restaurant, which gazes upon Toronto's financial district, was also pleasing. I will definitely return to Scaramouche in the future."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Scaramouche then run, don't walk to the nearest phone and make your reservation. The food is fantastic and, though the prices are steep for most of us, do what I do with friends and treat yourself to a wonderful meal once or twice (or ?? as often as you can afford) a year. The decor is an elegant, albeit retro, look which I personally appreciate but, make no mistake, the food is anything but retro!  The view of the Toronto skyline at night from inside is simply an added bonus. Again, don't walk, run to the closest phone and make a reservation! Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that this Toronto-born person took so long to dine at Scaramouche! It certainly won't be the last!  From the start--where I handed my car keys for the complimentary valet service (please don't forget to tip them!)--to being greeted and seated by the friendly hostess to a table with a phenomenal view of the city to the delicious food: I had the lobster bisque, seared foie gras--which was a special and not on the menu--for my appetizers and then my main was the melt-in-your-mouth venison and for dessert, Scaramouche's infamous Coconut Cream pie, definitely one of the best I've ever tasted, not too sweet, which I prefer, and very 'coconutty'.  But for me what made my dining experience rate 5 stars were the staff, especially my server, Marcus W., who was knowledgeable, friendly and courteous without being too obtrusive, giving great recommendations for a couple of wine pairings.   There's a reason why people keep dining at Scaramouche and I'm going to be one of them now. Simply fantastic."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It is exactly between an A OK and Im a fan. Went there on a cold winter night recently. It was a surprise dinner from hubby for a good review at work. We had the nicest table at the restaurant and the view was beautiful. They had a lobster special called lobsterlicious on that night and being crazy fans of the decadent critter we gladly succumbed.  I ordered a nice bubbly cocktail and it was a sublime feeling. The atmosphere is very retro and subtle.   Food was impeccable - my SO had the scallops as an appetizer and they were probably the best we have tasted in a while. We had a lot of lobster and it was all great and the portions were perfect (not microscopic) and we really enjoyed the meal . It was a beautiful, quiet evening with great food and a wonderful view.  The only thing that kept me from bestowing 5 stars was the attention to detail or the lack of it. I don't like cold bread and definitely expect the butter to be at room temperature so I don't have to hack at it. I expect the server to keep an eye on my drink for a second or third or (hic) fourth round.... For a place that is known for its subtle indulgences, maybe they need to focus on details. Thats what makes it a \"wohoooo\" experience and this fell a little short."}
{"text":"4 stars with a 5-star view  I thought the cab driver was crazy when he pulled up to an old condo / apartment but the restaurant is actually in the basement of the building. We ate in the dining room and the view of the Toronto skyline is incredible.  Service was exceptional the whole evening. The restaurant had a cool casual vibe despite the \"upscale\" pricing. The decor was oddly simple and plain.   Food was excellent - the highlights:  - The Yellow Fin sashimi starter was exceptional - easily one of the top 2 sashimi dishes ever. Each piece served with light sea salt, soy glaze and various vinaigrette's - simply perfect!!  - Excellent selection of fresh oysters - 2 kinds from the west coast. Shucked perfectly and super fresh.  - The Fillet Minion was amazing and cooked perfectly medium rare. A delicious bordelaise sauce was served over the steak. This was easily one of the best steak dishes I ever ate. Spectacular dish!  - The only miss for me was the Halibut main course. It was served on a bed of lemon saffron nage, potatoes and cherry tomatoes. The Halibut was fresh and yummy but I didn't enjoy the nage broth at all.  - Had to try the coconut cream pie given all the excellent reviews. Although I'm not generally a fan of cream pie's, I have to admit this pie is damn good. Bursting with real coconut flavor. Perfect for sharing.  Great wine selection but only two - three bottled beers :(   Pricing is on the high end - starters between $20 - $30 and mains between $40 - $50.   The incredible view combined with delicious food = a return visit for me...  BK"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience all around! I had never heard of this restaurant and now I feel like im the only one as everyone I share my experience with says they know or have been to this restaurant..... Service was exceptional, couldn't ask for anything more... These guys know what you want before you do and they are awsome! Food was also very very very very good! Loved every dish, wine pairing was also a great suggestion by our server! I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back!"}
{"text":"In the spirit of full disclosure I should admit that I know I have little to add to the acolades about Scaramouche. Great food, great service, great setting.  Tucked away behind Avenue road you feel like you are in a magical place hovering above the troubles of city life.    I completely understand why their fiercely loyal clientele protest changes in the menu.  My experience of classics like the fettuccine with steak and the coconut cream pie have made me a loyal fan as well. Alas, I cannot afford to be one of the regulars.   So this review is really for those of you that might think Scaramouche would be a good place to take a special someone, celebrate that family member accomplishment or impress that out of town visitor.  A definite no, for the special someone, a possible yes for the family member, and a yes for the out-of-towner if you don't need to talk about anything important.   I hesitate for the special someone because it is too loud and crowded for any kind of intimacy. It might be better early in the week,  but definitely not toward the weekend. The place was jammed at 7 pm.   Your family is probably going to be loud anyway (you're celebrating!), so they'll fit right in.   Your out of town guest will be impressed and blown away by the menu, food and service, but she or he isn't going to want to shout about business so it's best saved for a sealing-the-deal blowout (you're celebrating!).  Reservations definitely needed. And friends with more money."}
{"text":"I've only been to one restaurant on the planet better than this and it was in Paris. Simply as good as it gets, and the view of the city at night was spectacular. Nobody should be allowed to open a fine dining restaurant without first coming here to see how perfection is done lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary.  We requested a table with a view, which we received and were quite pleased with it. Although the wine list looked extensive, we had brought our own wine which we were saving for a special occasion. However we did start with a glass of cremant de Bourgogne rose and oysters. The sparkling was great! But who doesn't love Bourgogne? We tried a few different kinds of oysters and they were all fresh and delicious! For our mains, my husband got the partridge which was excellent, juicy with nice crispy skin,  I got the venison which was cooked perfectly (rare) and served with a veggie puree and walnuts.  The flavors complemented each other so well, and the plating was creative and beautiful. At the end of our meal we got 2 cups of goood espresso and a dessert.  The dessert was so satisfying; a chocolate peanut butter torte with home made pop rocks on it.  It sounds weird but it was a delight to eat!   Last but definitely not least, the service was excellent.  Our server, was friendly, attentive, really knowledgeable on the wine and food, and made our night very special.   She even removed the label from our wine so we could have it as a keep sake, and got the kitchen to write happy anniversary on our dessert.  Great food, excellent service and beautiful ambiance.  I would definitely recommend Scaramouche for that special night!"}
{"text":"This is no wonder as to why Scaramouche has been long-considered one of Toronto's finest. We celebrated our anniversary there tonight and, from start to finish, we were impressed by the high-level of service and excellent food. Our wait-staff were attentive, friendly, and offered superb recommendations (only when asked) on pairing wine with our selections. My partner chose an Ontario tomato salad & a scallop & gnocci dish, while I had grilled octopus & a sea bass. Coffee was excellent and the desserts were delicious but formidable. Thank you so much, Scaramouche - you helped make our day that much more special."}
{"text":"I should have written a review sooner. I have been to Scaramouche many times (note there is a difference between the restaurant and pasta bar. I have been to both, but am reviewing the restaurant. The food and service have always been great.   The location is very nice because you overlook the city when you are eating. So, make sure to get a seat next to the window.  The food has always been excellent. For appetizers, the last time I ordered the grilled which octopus is done perfectly. For the main course, I either get the lamb (one of the best I have had) or scallops. Dessert, I am not a dessert person, but their coconut creme pie with white chocolate shavings is good. The dishes come out at a good pace.  There is an extensive wine list and the sommelier is always there to help. He doesn't always recommend the most expensive wine - he just recommends what is good.  In terms of service, the staff are always attentive. Most importantly, wine glass is always full."}
{"text":"Had Scaramouche The Restaurant and I absolutely enjoyed the food. They have really perfected every single flavour. The service is very friendly and attentive also. Constant plate/utensil refreshment, food came fast  and tasted amazing.   We ordered the Shrimp Salad which was made with shrimps and lobster in a creamy sauce, the lobster roll without the roll topped with crunchy potato crisps.   Yellow Tuna Crudo which had capers, grape fruit, olive oil and sea salts ! To die for !  Pea Pecorino Ravioli ! The lemon saffron beurre fondue really made the dish! As it's all in the sauce right ?  Our main dishes was the Halibut and Lamb.  They managed to make sweet/ savoury/ spicy/ all in one on every dish to perfection. There wasn't one thing that was questionable in taste or gave me a bad reaction lol.   Lamb was marinated and cooked so well that there wasn't any Gamey taste at all. It was soft and melted in your mouth.   The halibut was beautiful and cooked to perfection as well, perfect moisture level maintained without any drying of the fish.   Please go to Scaramouche because it is the bomb !"}
{"text":"I booked the reservation one month in advance in order to get a window seas. The restaurant has a phenomenon view to see Toronto and CN tower. Make sure you make reservation to a later time in summer so you can see all the beautiful lights in the dark.   The food here will not disappoint you! Personally , I enjoyed Scaramouche much more than George. You could tell that the chef really put lots of attention to details in each dishes including the garnish. Every single item in the plate was flavorful.   Appetizer- we ordered grilled octopus and yellow tuna sashimi.  Scallop were taken down from the menu for the season and replaced by the grilled octopus. I was amazed by the octopus. Texture and flavor were balance perfectly.  I love the bacon bits at the side. Tuna sashimi was fresh and delicious as well.  Main- We ordered the seafood plate, which was the special of the day. It included half lobster tail, scallop and octopus. Lobster was cooked and seasoned beautifully. The other main we ordered was the signature rack of lamb. It was not grilled. I believe it was baked with crispy crunch outside of the lamb rack.They didn't ask how well I would like it to be. But I believe it was cooked b/t medium rare to medium. My boyfriend loved it so much. However it was not my cup of tea since I loved grill lamb rack better.   Coconut cream pie was our dessert option. You can feel the coconuts bits inside the pie. It was very traditional and delicious dessert. Since I am not a big fan of pie or coconut, I will give it a OKAY. It was too creamy for us, so we could not finish it. However, I did see the two ladies besides us finished the entire plate including the chocolate sauce for decoration. I could tell they were very satisfied about it.   In my opinion, this is the best French restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"The mains I tried were good but didn't blow me away (granted we mostly stuck to the pastas and seafood bouillabaisse).   It was the desserts, wines, service and Toronto views that won me over big time.  Depending on the occasion, next time I would try some of the richer dishes or dabble more with the apps (my partner's mom says that she often enjoys the yellowfin tuna tartare with radish and jicama with a nice white)   Highlight: As expected the famous coconut cream pie is a standout. Even more than this dessert, though, I kept on going back to the Wildflower Honey Vanilla Mousse Ontario (hot house rhubarb, blood oranges, oat crumble and rhubarb foam) and the lemon pot au creme."}
{"text":"I had a reservation with a group of people at 5.30pm and showed up 15 minutes early.   The restaurant does open until 5.30 and they refused to even open the door prior to such time.  So I am standing in the snow waiting to be allowed in. Will revise review after the meal, but service is already at an impossible low."}
{"text":"The lobster and shrimp pappardelle was my one of the best pastas that I have eaten. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the  Alfredo sauce was light and there was a balance of spinach which added color, texture and taste to this tasty pasta dish. The ambiance was romantic with a spectacular view of the Toronto skyline. I would recommend this restaurant for any special occasion."}
{"text":"food: 3.7 - decent in toronto but below par in the international scene of french cuisine Service: 4.0 - If only my main server could give me a bit more smiles   An intimate spot tucked away in the old residence of South Hills offering window views of the CN tower cityscape glistening in a distance.   The gnocchi was a pleasant surprise- airy and lightly toasted, its fluffiness juxtaposed with the crunchy texture of walnuts.  Warm Lobster was accentuated with delicate balance between the refreshing ginger sesame mayonnaise and lobster broth.    Partridge could be slightly less dry and more flavorful. Immaculate service overall from the knowledgeable waiters.  Valet parking upon arrival."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food here is fantastic. By far one of THE best restaurants in the province. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The presentation of the food was just extraordinary, and the taste...simply unforgettable. The ambiance is great, and it suits just about any occasion. The view is also breathtaking. I'm just gushing over this restaurant because despite its steep price it's simply perfect. It deserves every cent it charges. Also do the desert, get the spiced apple cake. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My family celebrated hubby's birthday here and what a decadent experience it was!  I had read many reviews and perused photos and decided we would give the #1 rated restaurant in Toronto (as per TripAdvisor) a try.  We were not at all disappointed!    Appearance is a bit deceiving as it looks like you'll pulling up to a condo instead of a classy restaurant.  There is complimentary valet parking, a nice touch.  You can check in your coat at the front.  Once inside, the restaurant is pretty spacious with a great view of the Toronto skyline; never can guess based on where it's situated!    Our table sampled a variety from the menu - I myself enjoyed the chef's complimentary amuse-bouche (wished I remembered the name, some smoked salmon bite), grilled octopus, grilled filet mignon and valrhona dark chocolate cremeux.  Made sure to order the classically recommended coconut cream pie for hubby as well.  All we could say was WOW!  Every course was mind-blowing; so deliciously moist, artfully plated and luxuriously pleasing to the palate.  Truly a treat the night was!  Service was also top notch.  We received the right amount of attention; detail-oriented and never rushed.  We were really allowed to have a leisurely and relaxed evening.    Overall, a definite splurge but highly recommended, especially if you are looking to celebrate!"}
{"text":"AMAZING would be an understatement if this place. I was beyond impressed. The ambience was very delightful, the service was impeccable and food, lord, the food was wonderful. It was very tasty and delicious, definitely the best meal I've had in years."}
{"text":"The ambience is elegant and serene at this quietly cloistered gem and despite arriving with very high expectations, I was completely blown away by the new and delicious flavors that I experienced. We began with the beet salad and moved on to our main courses, the filet and the seafood dish; both of which were eye-opening and enlightening. We finished off with the milk and honey and a pair of cheeses that did not disappoint. Would absolutely recommend Scaramouche without reservation."}
{"text":"Great service! Classy french restaurant for special occasions. Famous for their coconut cream pie. Everything was delicious, high quality & well presented. You pay for what you get here."}
{"text":"Okay this was my second fine-dining experience. Just a regular checking out a nice restaurant in the city!   So first off, I'd like to comment on our waiter who was very professional. At one point, I actually caught him looking at how I incorrectly held my knife heheh. Anyways, there were a team of them actually who never let our glass of water become empty. Someone was always wiping the crumbs on our table.   The decor--- who cares lol. The view of the city was what it was all about. It's so romantic. I came here with my hubby and it was so romantic that it made me happy and in love hahaha.   The food!!!!!! I will never forget my filet mignon!!!! Omg... I was actually just craving a well-done filet mignon so I was expecting it to be a little chewy, but it was not. It was still nice and tender. The cubed potatoes were good along with the crunchy green beans and mushrooms. And finally to end the meal, the coconut cream pie was a nice ending. A must!"}
{"text":"Read many reviews before making reservations, all were excellent. The service in the restaurant is excellent, the view of the city was also excellent.  Unfortunately my entrée, the lamb described with crispy mustard crust was not crispy and the overall flavor was just average. The parmesan frites described as something to share was actually a small order not for sharing and had very little flavor. Not sure if they were cooked in duck fat or not. The daily soup was excellent and would highly recommend it.  Unfortunately overall experience was just average and not as expected based on past reviews."}
{"text":"After the valet parking, the coat check, there is the stairs to the waiting space.  It was my second time in six years and it still impresses with an awesome view, a great menu, delicious main courses and the BEST creme brulee.  Won't break your wallet either. My dish is pulled rabbit.  Gnocchi, rapini, and rabbit...  Your taste buds never had it so good. My girl's Ollie's dish; calf liver, mash potatoes, and onion rings.  Not your average fare.  Delicious. I highly recommend this spot as a romantic restaurant (dining room), or a BD celebration place.  Great wait staff as well.  Finagle a window seat with at lest two hours of dining time.  Scaramouch has its prized regulars."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant with impeccable service! My boyfriend surprised me with this special place on our anniversary. Always have heard amazing reviews and was very happy to finally try the place out. Must order: Their coconut cream pie was on my list of must try desserts in Toronto. First off, i am not a huge fan of coconut but this pie blew my mind! Portion is huge and definitely can be shared with another person. The texture of the cream was so smooth and the white chocolate shaving on top gives it such a good kick! The crust of the pie is buttery but delicious. Definitely a must order if you're going to Scaramouche."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service with a view to match. Definitely ask for a wine pairing with every possible course, our server was very knowledgeable and each pairing was spot on.  I will definitely be returning to Scaramouche"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly one of Toronto's finest restaurants !! The entire experience starting from the complimentary valet to the food service is amazing. The view of the Toronto skyline and the lights in the evening is charming !!   Words won't do justice to the food. I had the Zucchini flower appetizer with asparagus, that was light and delicious. The lamb main course was perfectly cooked and had a plethora of flavours on the plate. And their coconut pie is just a must have for the perfect ending !!! Wife had the Buffalo mozzarella salad which I have to say was delicious, and so was the trout for main course.    To top it off we bumped into Jim Treliving (Boston Pizza/Dragon's Den fame)."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my two favourite restaurants in the Greater Toronto Area, and it definitely takes the cake (or, rather, the coconut cream pie) if we're talking ambiance, service, and food quality. I don't think it's possible to comprehensively summarize the wealth of good experiences I've had here, but I'll do my best.   Location and Size: Scaramouche is tucked away high on Avenue Road, just on the outskirts of downtown. The restaurant is in a nice, quiet area, and sits under a relatively luxurious condominium at 1 Benvenuto Place. Immediately upon entering, one is greeted by a coat-check, and can then make one's way down the stairs into the restaurant. The lighting, views, and elegance are second to none: white walls and warm, dark wood, candle light, and a view of Toronto from afar, framed by trees. I always feel serene and prone to optimistic dreaming as soon as I enter, and leave feeling relaxed, all because of the environment! Everyone we've taken here has been captivated by the atmosphere. The restaurant is also spacious, accommodating parties of six or more, I believe. You will, however, have to book in advance for larger groups, as they do tend to be consistently largely full!  Staff: The gentleman who appears to be the maître d' is always absolutely a pleasure; he's quirkily entertaining, personable, and knows his wining and dining well. He was also extremely gracious when we once had to leave prematurely due to a health problem; despite the fact that I was afraid we had inconvenienced him, he only expressed sympathies, and was very welcoming and understanding. In fact, every staff member we've had the pleasure of meeting thus far has been great! I haven't ever had to wait long for courses, which are very well-timed, nor have I had to navigate too many dishes on the table at once. I also sincerely appreciate the fact that the kitchen and front-of-house are always willing to accommodate peculiar allergies and food preferences: some of my family members eat halaal (and thus also avoid alcohol), and I myself am both unable to digest mushrooms, avocado, and mango, and occasionally follow a vegetarian diet. The staff have always gone out of their way to make sure we are content despite our more unusual requirements while tactfully but honestly remarking if a dish's flavor were to be skewed by our needs, and I appreciate that immensely.  Prices: Sure, Scaramouche isn't inexpensive, but I'd say it's well worth the money. For two or more considerably hungry people, the bill can go as high as $200+, independent of wine. But rest assured, you won't be disappointed!  Food: Ah, the best part! I like the fact that the menu changes every so often, independent of the season - it makes for something new to take a look at every time! Thus far, we've had the yellowfin tuna sashimi, ricotta ravioli, a series of lobster-oriented dishes (a temporary installment), pacific white sturgeon, grilled calamari, an assortment of salads (including beet and wild carrot salads) and soups (a particularly nice one involved chilled pea and asparagus), crême brûlée, Parmesan frites, and, of course, the coconut cream pie! The fish is always succulent and very well-paired with the accompanying sauces, and the coconut cream pie had our whole workplace ooh-ing and aah-ing. A lot of attention goes into synchronizing fresh ingredients; while the combinations created aren't always as diverse, everything is consistently amazingly well-done, and I even find it nice to try different pairings of similar ingredients - I almost feel like there's sometimes a theme going on, and I like that! I also absolutely love their fresh-baked pecan bread - wish I could make that at home. The amuse-bouche they provide at the beginning of every meal has never been disappointing, either!  Additional Notes:  1) Their website just had a pretty nice revamp - definitely conveys their essence more now! 2) Book in advance if you're a bigger group - they fill up.  3) Let them know it's your birthday, or that you're celebrating something, and they'll gladly add a candle and a congratulatory note to your dessert! 4) I can't comment in too much depth about their meats, given that I haven't tried them, but their fish and vegetarian dishes are spectacular. 5) You can get full pies for take-away! Do it!  Seriously, give this one a go! Many of our special occasions (and many more everyday triumphs) have been celebrated here, and for due cause!"}
{"text":"1 of new favorite restaurants  Amazing views of the city. Impeccable service, great ambiance and of course the fooood. Great date place, its cozy and romantic. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was sure we were in the wrong location when the Uber dropped us off--what is this condo complex? But I started to believe their location was intentional after we dined there.   Riding an obvious high of being newly engaged aside, everything at Scaramouche seemed fascinating, even the (much older) crowd. Champagne and oysters to start was probably an immature choice at a restaurant with a reputation like Scaramouche, but I don't care.   The food, much like the atmosphere and decor, did not venture into bizarre, boisterous, or experimental territories. They wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to more traditional dishes, done exceptionally well.   We had the octopus which was the best I've ever had in my life, seriously. This is non-negotiable. Then we shared the scallops, he ordered the filet, and I the halibut. Die die die. Our glasses were never empty; the waiter was prompt and friendly, the busboys were on top of it all, the view truly outstanding. And still, the view is second to the food.   Without any prompting, the waiter brought us a little congratulations dessert saying he sensed we were celebrating an engagement. So sweet, thanks Scaramouche."}
{"text":"I had the potato soup and pork entrée. The soup was the star of my meal, it was a simple item but tasted better than my girlfriend's foie gras appetizer. My entire didn't wow me but it was well cooked and the veggies that came with it were the star of the dish, as my girlfriend loved the mushrooms. The dessert was one Chocolate Cremeux which may suit a coffee lover more as it had a very espresso taste, but I liked the pear that accompanied it. At about $80 per person person, you get a wonderful classy restaurant experience and the food is pretty good. I just chose a dessert that didn't suit my taste. One thing that was annoying was after I parked in a clearly public area a guy ran up asking if I was going to the restaurant, saying that valet parking was required, though there weren't signs, so I was sceptical about handing over my keys after I parked myself. And I didn't need him to drive my car up to me compared to the 20-30 ft I needed to walk myself. They should buy a sign that there is valet service and why is it required? I may have considered using it if parking wasn't already so close and abundantly available."}
{"text":"Nothing prepared me for the view. I read the reviews and I've been around enough to not get blown away by things much. Well. I was knocked over.  Honestly go for just the view. It's worth the $$$$.  The food is classic Canadian fine dining, that weird half way point between french and Italian. The ambiance is like a high end gallery, corporate but not in a cold way.   Anyway, the Fois Gras was heavenly, simple and clean. Beautiful seasonal veggies and a simple crisp potato latke. Followed with a Chinook salmon special that was exceptionally prepared, raw at the center and crisped edges, my mouth is watering. The sauce was a citrus cream that was so delicate and sublime it erases bad child hood memories.  Not really a cocktail place. Stick to their menu, it's pretty well flushed out but I'd love to see some tequila cocktail on there. The wine list is very well rounded as well, though I was expecting a little more Italian repping.   I took away one star bc the service, while excellent from the entire staff, was exceedingly slow at times from our main server, never returning to see how the meal was, not really checking in and I had to wait a fair length of time to be able to ask for a drink.  That being said, he may have been over worked as the place was busy.   Cannot wait to visit again and again."}
{"text":"My lovely husband decided to take me to Scaramouche for V Day this year.  I think we need to find reasons to go every month!  The place:  Classy, not too noisy, fantastic view...definitely request a window seat in the main restaurant!   Service: We had a fantastic server. Attentive and knowledgeable. Service was spectacular!   The Eats and the drinks: Kir Scaramouche - delicious...their take on Kir Royale.   I opted for the Quebec duck starter while my OH had blue cheese soufflé. The souffle was light and perfect. My starter was just wow....foie gras terrine and smoked duck pastrami. Decadent and delicious.   Mains; smoked bacon wrapped venison was my choice...perfectly cooked rare with a fantastic jus reduction. Served with a sprout and hazelnut salad, roasted parsnips. Melt in the mouth amazing. So many flavours and textures.  My OH had the partridge...fried foie gras....enough said!  For dessert I opted for the famous coconut cream pie. I had a \"When Harry met Sally moment\"...each mouthful is basically an oral orgasm! The earth moved! What I can only describe as a cannoli-esque crust, filled with sweet creamy coconut, topped with light fluffy cream and white chocolate curls.  You can purchase a whole pie for $48...8 huge slices in that. I decided against this for fear of eating myself in to a sugar coma.  Wild horses could not keep me away from this place; I am in love!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and they don't disappoint, ok well the hostess did. They ignored us and took forever to seat us and I had made a reservation. Side note, I also looked fantastic so I'm not sure why the snob reaction!  Shout out to our server Max. He was excellent. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly... did I mention super cute? He's from Germany and has the cutest accent, sadly though, married to the pastry chef. Zut. The other blonde waitress needs a few more lessons, she just dropped plates down without even a word. At these prices, you should take the time to introduce the menu.  We started with the oysters. I wasn't going to but they were Washington Kumamotos and we know how I feel about the small shelled oysters. The shuckers were not professional... Evident by the fact that there were bits of shell in my oyster. Yuck.  Then came the duck. The duck meat was ok. A little tough but I loved loved loved the pâté on a toasted piece of bread... Speaking of bread, I would go back just to eat the free bread. They have this raisin and pecan house bread that you cannot stop eating... I'm not lying when I said I had 4 pieces... The butter though needed to be thawed a little. It was as hard as ice. The baguette was pretty rocking too.  Then we had the 3 types of goat cheeses. My favourite was the log cheese on a toasted crustini from the Loire valley. Yummmmmmm.  For the main we had the partridge. The artichoke purée is of a Jerusalem variety so it had a very potato-y flavour to it...healthy mashed potatoes! Although it probably had more than a dollop of cream fraiche. It came with the breast of the bird - cooked in a vacuum bag and then pan fried for crispness. The leg, which was confit (cooked in its own fat) and the there was a huge (size of my palm) duck fois gras... The gravy sauce was a bit of a let down but the porcini mushrooms, beets and leeks were oh la la!  We finished with the blonde chocolate. It had a white chocolate, burnt so it had a woody caramel flavour to it. There was apricot fruit gravitas (chunky snow cone) sprinkled with dried honeycomb and chocolate bits. And since it was my birthday, they wrote happy birthday and put a candle in my dessert for me... Sweet.  They are famous for their coconut cream pie. We had ordered it but they had forgotten so Max was so lovely and packed me a piece to go. Now, coconut cream pie... Why would that be a specialty... a specialty they have had for 30 years and you can order a whole one to go... Because it is the greatest thing ever. Very generous portions of real coconut... Perfect sweetness to the cream and such a thin crust... It really is a must!  Scaramouche. It has taken me so long to get to you... I mean, you are in the basement of a condo building but true to their word, a lovely view of the Toronto skyline and valet parking. The valet parking guys were amazing. Great memory and quick to action.  Only downside to the experience, it took me 3 days to digest 8000 calories... I'm not kidding. I think my body is still trying to recover after a month."}
{"text":"What we loved: -Valet service, helped us be on time for our reservation -The service - our waiter seemed very knowledgeable and well read, and went out of his way to bring dishes in a certain order, refill our coffee 3 times, and recommend dishes that would complement each other.  -The steak tartare first course was like nothing I've had before and was savoury and delicious. -We ordered filet mignon and lamb for second courses, which were both tender, juicy and savoury. The filet mignon was one of the best steaks I've ever had! -The coffee! It was Reunion Island coffee and went down very smoothly. -The view - definitely ask for a seat by the window. -The ambience was a good balance of casual and formal, and felt romantic with all the couples around us.  What we liked (not loved) -The sashimi first course - the flavours, to me, masked the sashimi too much. But it was an interesting dish. -The coconut cream pie and lemon mousse were good desserts but not sweet/rich enough for my sweet tooth!  Overall, this was one of my best restaurant experiences and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends for Lobsterlicious special.  Great food and great service.  The Coconut Cream Pie is the best you can find in the city!!!"}
{"text":"A bite from our full review -  Making the parallels with the French opera' title character, the restaurant was a hero in disguise. Unnoticeable, tucked away under a residential building out of the beaten path, but packed with energy to surprise and attack your senses with flavour. A great special occasion spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great view. We came here for our anniversary. The restaurant added some personal touches that made our dinner feel special. 5 stars for excellent value to $ spent."}
{"text":"When food is $40 + I have two requirements in my book: 1) The presentation must be phenomenal and 2) the food must give me an orgasm in my mouth. Unfortunately, my Elk entree fell short of these two expectations.   Though, the elk was cooked to medium-rare perfection and it was wrapped in a flavorful bacon crust, it was not $46 spectacular. It was more like $25 spectacular.  I enjoyed my meal - but it did not tantalize my senses which I think at these steep prices, is a necessary requirement.   My boyfriend had the filet Mignon. He said it was probably the best Filet Mignon he ever had.   HOWEVER, the Coconut Cream pie was to die for. Light and creamy topped with white chocolate shavings. It was the show stopper of the entire evening.   The view is very nice but the decor is dated. I liked its hidden location but I feel like Scaramouche needs a renovation that would reflect both price and culinary creativity. Though, the service was impeccable.   A restaurant of this caliber has so much potential. But, it needs to be demonstrated in all aspects of the dining experience. Instead of listing martini's made with Absolut vodka upgrade them to Grey Goose. Instead of a main-stream fine dining presentation, go above and beyond. Perhaps, channel some molecular gastronomy tactics to give it some pizzazz.   The hype attracted me but the overall experience + food did not exceed my expectations therefore I will not be returning. At $46 I want innovation not main-stream boredom."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a great view of the city.   Went here for an anniversary dinner. Our waiter was very attentive, and helpful. We started with the daily soup and sea scallop appetizers both of which were fantastic. For the main I had the lamb which was cooked to perfection; perfectly complemented by the wine suggested by our waiter.  We had to try the coconut cream pie for desert, and true to the reputation it was probably one of the best deserts I've had.  Must try restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Scaramouche for my birthday dinner in January. It's good to see that a restaurant that has been around for this long is worth the hype!   Our waiter was extremely professional. Service here is top-notch and they are quick to fill water glasses and change cutlery, as well as appropriate in their timing when offering you another glass of wine. He was friendly and courteous, without hovering.  The view here is amazing! I honestly couldn't capture it properly on my phone, so I won't even bothering including a photo. (In fact, all my photos didn't turn out so well because it is so dark in there, but also because my phone just doesn't perform well in dark spaces.) You just have to see it for yourself. What was really surprising, is that this restaurant is actually located on the lower level of a condo building. And yet the other side of the building opens up to one of the most spectacular views of the city that I have ever seen.   They started us off with an amuse bouche, which was a nice surprise. We ordered two starters and two mains and shared them both. For our starters, we had the fois gras terrine and the butter-poached lobster. The fois gras terrine was served with sea salt brioche, pickled grapes, maple jelly and sour cherry glaze. This plate was almost too pretty to eat! Every single component here complimented the others perfectly. The butter-poached half-lobster with warm artichoke barigoule, salad of shaved fennel, blood orange, capers and watercress was amazing! Perfectly cooked, and they managed to add so many elements which worked so well together.   One of the mains we ordered was the Quebec venison, which was a red wine braised, bacon-wrapped, and roasted loin, served with potato gnocchi, roasted root vegetables and brussel sprouts, venison red wine jus and English mustard cream. This dish was so good! This venison rivals all other venison dishes I have ever had in my life. We also ordered the Rack of lamb with crispy mustard crust, Swiss chard, pickled curry cherry tomatoes and carrot purée, spicy eggplant relish and toasted walnut breadcrumbs. I think this turned out to be one of my favourite dishes of the night! The mustard crust on the lamb made the dish; I am not sure how they got the crust so crispy, but it was amazing.   My husband surprised me with the famous coconut cream pie for dessert, and let me tell you. THE HYPE IS REAL, PEOPLE. I have NEVER had a cream pie of ANY sort that is SO light and fluffy. I am not sure how they do it, but it is not to be missed.  Scaramouche is one of those places that you can tell puts thought into every single thing on the plate. Nothing is an afterthought. I had an amazing birthday dinner and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my anniversary dinner, and it was a great experience. This place is a little difficult to find (at least for us out-of-towners) but the building is beautiful and you get a wonderful view of Toronto's skyline. Complimentary valet parking as well!   I had the truffled gnocchi as an appetizer, and it was beyond wonderful. What's funny is that I found the greens and the fried scallions that accompanied the gnocchi was as good or even better than the gnocchi itself! Still, it was a great explosion of different tastes in my mouth. My boyfriend had the soup of the day, which was a creamy leek and potato soup with creme fraiche and he really enjoyed it. ALso ordered a Snapdragon, which is one of their most popular cocktails. Thumbs up!  For mains, I had the duck, which was stuffed with wild mushrooms and accompanied with a salad. Hands down the best duck i've had to date. The duck was cooked perfectly pink, and the salad that came with it was AWESOME. My boyfriend had the lamb, which he really really liked.   For dessert, we had the coconut cream pie, as everyone raved about it on their own reviews. I personally think it lives up to the standard that everyone has said; its absolutely delicious! The crust is amazing and the cream is not too sweet and worked extremely well with the coconut.   At a cost of almost $200 between the both of us, it is not a place to go everyday! But for a special occasion, it sure is a place to keep in mind. Service was great, knowledgeable, and very professional. Be sure to dress nice for this place and review some proper table manners! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"i think Splendido,and jacobs were my only fav high end restaurants in toronto but i think i have a new fav!  I had the Lobster set menu- was delicious.. everything.. appetizer scallops, grilled lobster for main and dessert(apple and very boozy ice cream)  the restaurant is def not modern but the view from the window was beautiful, service A+, wine selection was A+.."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this restaurant out for months! Came here for my birthday and it was amazing from service to food. I tried almost everything on the menu and was not disappointed with any of it. In the end you must try the coconut cream pie, its delish! --take out if you're too full."}
{"text":"It's been probably my 7th or 8th time going to this restaurant over the past few years and it remains my favourite restaurant in the city of Toronto.  This place is simply an institution and a restaurant Toronto should be very proud of.   2008 showed up with the recession and many restaurants got hurt, the whole culinary industry in the city, all industries in North America!.... and it was very sad to have to see some great restaurants disappear or downsize/\"downgrade\"... good bye Perigee, Susur (of Susur Lee), the \"original\" Splendido (not to say the new one is not good - just different and a different \"scale\") .... But Scaramouche stood there SOLID!   The past few times I have been fortunate enough to get a seat by the window and enjoy the amazing view.  But just as wonderful is the service by the waiter in that section -Andrew-.  He simply knows everything there is to know about food, about the restaurant and its history, about each dish.  He is likely the same person someone called \"a mind reader\" and how could he not  be when he's been with the restaurant for over a decade if not close to two!.    \"This restaurant has witnessed newly weds celebrating their honey moon or proposing and 25 years later celebrating their silver anniversary\" he told us proudly as he served the wine!.  And the food, well, every time is magnificently crafted and delicious, I can never get anything than pan seared foie gras as appetizer, had the lamb for my main and shared the coconut pie for dessert, pure indulgence! all delicious.  We have many excellent restaurants in this city and we should be proud of our diversity and culinary richness but I also hope a few more restaurants emerge that be at par with the level of food and service Scaramouche offers (don't get me wrong, I appreciate them and love them all .... but.... - Scaramouche is...JUST ONE STEP ABOVE THE REST)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and place. I am really in love of this place the staff since the valet parking to the manager was very kind and helpful, all our waiters were amazing with their service and the food can be compare with the most delicious food in all the Town and since Gordon Ramsey's  Steak house in Vegas We never had a food as delicious as this We highly recommend this place because we celebrated our wedding anniversary and they wrote it in chocolate in our dessert and the manager personally brought it to our table wishing us a happy anniversary too."}
{"text":"Great view of the city. Food is excellent and the service is good. Beer selection no good but Riesling is nice. Reserve early for seats by the window it's surprisingly busy in there. Also average age is 106."}
{"text":"When entering the dining room looks dated but the food is impeccable which us all that matters. The service is a 10/10 to match the food. Our first course if lobster an crab were on point. The filet mignon and lamb were better than I have had before."}
{"text":"I tried foie gras for the first time here and man, it was GOOOOD....  Perfectly seared with a slightly cold center.  The food is excellent and romantic.  Service is incredible.  Ate here with my aunt and uncle who's wallets are pretty deep - you can get one of the best meals in Toronto here.  Great wine list.  Free valet (at least when I went) which is convenient because parking isn't great in this area."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at Scaramouche tonight. As other Yelpers have mentioned, do not let the unexpected location on the bottom floor of a condo building fool you. This lovely restaurant is built onto a hill and has a very nice view of downtown. It is cozy inside as well.  Our food was excellent. Rather than going into experimental territory, the menu sticks to classic dishes prepared really well. I enjoyed my halibut, and my husband really liked his duck. The coconut cream pie was also delicious--very creamy but not too sweet.  To top it off, the service was excellent. Our waiter had worked at Scaramouche for many years and clearly enjoyed his job. We would definitely come back on our next Toronto trip!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for Lobsterlicious a couple of years ago.  There were some good dishes: + butter-poached lobster: cauliflower puree with puntarelle and shaved fennel, smoked bacon butter sauce + lobster bisque + crème brûlée: flavored with bourbon madagascar vanilla beans, raspberry sorbet and langue de chat biscuits  There were some bad dishes: - lobster and farfalle rigate: leeks, spinach and chard, with lobster tarragon sauce - pan-roasted sea scallop (too salty, too much lemon zest) - frozen hazelnut parfait with brown butter snap cookies (not frozen enough, too nutty)  And then there was a really terrible one: venison loin. It's supposed to be one of their best dishes, but it was waaaaaaaay too salty.  Really great waiters/waitresses though - or maybe that's just Canada (people here are ridiculously nice and friendly)! I'll probably be back to give Scaramouche another try."}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth it. The staff are on another level. The food is top notch. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time I am thoroughly impressed.  It is no wonder that Scaramouche has been ranked one of Toronto's best restaurants for so many years.  From their 5 star service, impressive and lengthly wine selection, and mouth-watering, beautifully presented food.  I have never been disappointed coming here, and although its location is hidden, it presents a beautiful view of the city.  I'll cheers to that!"}
{"text":"When it comes to the caliber and quality of food and service Scaramouche is Fantastic.  However when you see the lack of attention to detail in the men's room, I am truly shocked!  This is not what I expect.  Fresh flowers in the mens room, but the hand towels should be in a quality basket along with the tissues should be covered with a quality basket cover.  This in the end disappoints.  Luxury is always about attention to detail.  This needs to be fixed before I can increase my rating.  What a silly way to loose a coveted star!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here every year for my anniversary. Great views, consistent food, incredible service, and great price!  The first time we ate in the dining room. Food was delicious and perfectly cooked.  But honestly my real love is the pasta bar and grill!! There's a lot more variety in there and they have my favourite - peppercorn fettuccine.  This is easily the best pasta I've ever had. Hand-made pasta sits in a peppery cream-based sauce. It's topped with a variety of mushrooms, pine nuts, bread crumbs, and the most perfect medium rare pieces of steak. I usually can't finish it, but that's okay, more left overs for me!  I have tried the Seafood Ragu. First time was delicious, tons of perfectly cooked melty fish. Second time I had it it was alot less seafood than I remember and some of the pieces were tough and had bones :S.   The calamari app was really good as was the bufala mozza salad (which I'm not sure is still on the menu).  Service is always impeccable and friendly. I don't know how they do it but they always show up at my table at the right time. Neither overbearing nor scarce. The last time I was there the waiter remembered us and when told it was our anniversary brought us out some Port and a complimentary dessert. Creme Brulee was good. The coconut cream pie is rich, decadent and amazing - if a little heavy. I would just get it to go for a little late night snack/  The restaurant is surprisingly casual and down-to-earth, the food is always consistently good, and the price isn't extravagant. These things alone make it a five-star worthy restaurant.   Would I return? Every year, as usual."}
{"text":"Bar none- the best service, food and wine in the city that I've been to. There are two restaurants with totally different styles. The Pasta Bar is upscale bistro and The Dining Room is French Fine Dining.  The wine list is extensive with regional breakdowns and Sommeliers' Selections.  You will love the Filet Mignon- done traditionally by Executive Chef Keith Frogget as well as the Coconut Cream Pie, Liver and calamari... to name just a select few from each menu.  Beautiful city views as well! You wouldn't believe it, but Scaramouche offers a stunning view of the city atop the crest of Avenue Road, south of St. Clair.  An experience not to be missed. Dinner for two can range from $200- $500 depending on the wine. Service is unparalleled.  Go there!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale restaurant with an amazing view of the city and the staff fawn over you.  However, the 2-star docking is on the grounds that the restaurant is stupidly expensive.  When I went in August 2010, I found the food decent but not amazing.  I could fit the main course into the palm of my hand.  6 of us ate there for over $800 and I still left hungry!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Toronto and was back in town to visit as a tourist. Living in San Francisco had set me up with high expectations of fine dining since we have such a wide selection of Michelin star restaurants in our neighborhood.   The asparagus soup was delicious to start. The scallop appetizer was also on point. We had the lamb and the veal for our mains. I personally enjoyed the lamb dish more and the spicy eggplant relish was great to balance the dish.  Scaramouche definitely delivered that experience I have come to expect in the creativity of the dishes (plating and flavors) as well as service."}
{"text":"What makes this place is the view and the service. Nestled in the Casa Loma area, toucan be a challenge to spot this hidden restaurant, however once found it's quite an exquisite and romantic place. Overlooking the city skyline from your table Scaranouche prides itself on culinary perfection. I had the opportunity to take Jen here for her bday and we were both amazed, the view, the service, food and ambiance gives this place uniqueness.  **For starters we shared their Fois Gras, beautifully presented on a bed of greens.  **Mains I had their St Canut Pork, two beautiful cuts with the bone attached, presentation was lovely, packed with a melody of flavors.  **Dessert I had their coconut cream pie, it was quite the slice, beautiful, sweet and savoury.  Overall a great meal to compliment a great evening. Everything about this place is beautiful...to top it off they've also got complimentary valet parking...obviously if you're spending an arm and leg it better be comp LOL."}
{"text":"We came here for my friends bday dinner and was blown away with the service and food quality..I would have never guessed that this old condo building had a hidden gem underneath it with valet parking as well as delicious food, impeccable service..  We were a party of 4, ended up ordering approximately 3 appys, 4 entrees and I got a cake from Nadege. We ordered the fois gras, ravioli, lobster and shrimp salad as appys...  The fois gras with sea salt brioche was delicious, my friend is usually not a foie gras fan but she did try it and was also surprised by the quality...much better than whatever you find at Whole Foods or Pusateri. It tasted like the foie gras I purchased in France....  Ravioli was an \"A-Ok\", there was like 4 pieces and the taste was not outstanding, I would not recommend to order that as it was not worth its price..  The Nova Scotia lobster and Shrimp salad was purely delicious...the lobster and shrimp chopped and placed into a rectangle. The size of the lobster and shrimp was not being compromised due to the small pieces. I was still able to taste the freshness in both. Nothing overpowered each other...  Main courses, we ordered Lamb, Steak, Halibut and Veal. I personally am not a lamb fan becuz it has a weird smell, IMO, but I gave this a shot as my other friend ordered it...I was quite surprised that it didn't smell and the meat was very tender...my halibut was cooked perfectly...everything was just purely amazing...  Throughout the night, we had a total of 4 people serving us, our main server, table cleaner, beverage person and the manager semi served us.  From being seated, plating, service to the last step that we left. We were all amazed with everything.  Your only concern may be price as it's definitely a high end place..  Do come on special occasions, its well worth it!"}
{"text":"Upscale upscale upscale.   From the valet parking, to the staff, this place is top notch. You get what you pay for.   The service was very welcoming and everyone is on top of everything. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. Polite and hard working.   The food was simply out standing. So simple, yet full of flavor. Fresh, savory, and super delicious.   The menu does always change, so I would check online first before going.   Ordered both seafood and lamb, and both were outstanding.   The coconut cream pie, along with their other desserts are a perfect ending to a beautiful meal. Even the regular brewed coffee was made perfectly.   The ambiance was both casual and upscale, so of it's a special occasion or just a regular meal, this is the place to go.   Be prepared to spend a good amount of money per person, at least $70 without alcohol, but it's well worth it.   Valet parking is prompt and such a great addition to the experience especially when dining in downtown T.O.   Definitely will visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I went here for my office Xmas dinner (party of 8). The  food was outstanding! We had ordered some appetizers to share, oysters from the UK were large, fresh and delicious! the smoked salmon was fresh and packed full of taste, the goat cheese platter was yummy, especially the pesto sauce.  They also serve fresh bread (white & whole wheat) with butter. i had the filet mignon which came with green beans and whipped mashed potatoes!  I have no complaints! The majority of the party had their special of the day which was a georgian bay fish with lobster. Service was exceptional! Our waiter was always on top of things and they have staff constantly refilling ur wine or water. The view is spectacular! I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu!  If you want it all? Come to this place! Not only great for a romantic evening but great for group functions!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, will not be going back  It was my 25th birthday and my boyfriend wanted me to try the coconut cream pie at Scaramouche after our dinner at Centro.  Our navi took us to an apartment building roundabout that had an illuminated sign that said \"Scaramouche\". We got out, and saw a person seated on a chair in front of us.  We asked him if he was the valet and he just replied 'yes'. We asked him if we could get valet service and if he wanted us to pay now for it and still seated he replied 'its tip'. My boyfriend assumed he was having a bad day for his hesitant service and decided to park on the street in front of us.   Then we walked down the stairs and saw the hostess, busy talking to two customers leaving, and a Maitre D looking out to a wall. We awkwardly waited without being greeted (there was no one else in front or behind us) for about five minutes before I went up to the Maitre D and asked if they were still open for service.  She then proceeded to seat us at a table in the pasta bar.   The waiter came after a few minutes and asked us \"You guys having dinner or not?\".  We said we weren't sure and asked for the dessert menu to peruse as well (my bf wanted to try the steak tartare).    Then, he disappeared!  We randomly got a new waiter. My bf noted that it might be because we're not having a full dinner that he passed us on to a lower-ranked waiter.  Needless to say the 2nd waiter  was amazing, so sweet and attentive. It was just odd that eating at The Keg, TGIF, Milestones or even Kelseys the waiters tell you if they're leaving a shift or if someone else is going to take care of us. Is it because we weren't spending enough to warrant his time?  I found this unacceptable for an establishment such as Scaramouche.  It gets worse.  That same disappearing water was serving the table right next to us, with three wonderful ladies that were just finished having a lovely dinner. The waiter brought them dessert on the house. I heard one of the ladies say \"he's such a darling, he's definitely getting extra tip\". Then they got the bill and fought for it before agreeing to go dutch. They took out their iphones to calculate 20% tip from the before tax price of the meal.    They closed the bill and the waiter took it away, only TO COME BACK FIVE MINUTES LATER. He said exactly \"I'm sorry to say this but, I think you guys made a mistake on the bill, I'm really sorry but you might want to check the total again\" and left. He pretty much ASKED FOR MORE TIP. The ladies were so apologetic and were startled that they would make such a mistake. I saw them count, and recount, and found THEY MADE NO MISTAKE AND DID GIVE HIM 20%.  The ladies were arguably upset. I'm just surprised that this one waiter, could ruin both our evening and the evening of four ladies. The coconut cream pie was good. The coffee was old.  I wanted to write them a letter but they don't have an email posted on their website."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  I took my girlfriend here for her birthday.  The food was delicious and was only outdone by the shining service we recieved.  Our waiter was awesome.  I had a few dietery restrictions and he was very patient and seemed to not mind at all.  I look forward to going back. I can't forget to mention, the view of Toronto was beautiful. I definitely look forward to doing back... :)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here.  Great food and great service.  Always spot on.  A Toronto classic since the 80's.  Wonderful view.  $$$$$ but worth it!"}
{"text":"A top notch restaurant overlooking the city skyline. Scaramouche lives up to its reputation, providing excellent service with a menu to match. A must-go for special occasions. Try out the pasta bar at Scaramouche if you are looking for top-tier food at more affordable prices. A truly gourmet foodie experience."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time at Scaramouche. My bf took me here for my birthday :) There's complimentary valet parking, which is nice because it's located near a residential area.. not sure where to park haha  The view was amazing from where we were seated so that added to the nice ambiance.   I'd recommend: King Crab Ravioli - the crab was very fresh, you can taste the individual chunks of crab meat.  Butter poached Nova Scotia lobster - This was amazinggg... all the flavours were soaked into the lobster. Soo good!  Partridge - The meat was juicy and the foie gras was pan-seared nicely. Crispy on the sides and soft in the middle.  DESSERTS: Valrhona Araguani Chocolate Delice GODLY GOOD :D needless to say... I'll definitely order this again!   Service was excellent. Will come back to try other things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Michelin star reviewer, hello????   An amazing meal, amazing service, incredibly plated dishes and amazing view of Toronto.  What else does this restaurant need to do for a star?  It has it all and more in my humble opinion.  Ok, maybe you take a point off for the curbside appeal of driving up to a residential building. But, once inside, the experience is first class starting from the maitre'd who was incredibly friendly and welcoming. A 6pm reservation was honored early with a window table facing the beautiful skyline of Toronto.  Immediately we were offered drinks from a great selection of wines and liquor. After a basket of 3 different delicious breads. A wonderful amous bouche on the house of smoked salmon on top of a smear of squid ink was then served- a creative and wonderful taste of the sea.  For appetizers we went with the Blood Orange salad and the Yellow Fin tuna sashimi. Salad was refreshing with beautiful orange beets and large shave slices of ricotta with perfectly matched pieces of avocado to balance the dish.  The yellow fin tuna sashimi was fresh and served with thin curled cucumber, toasted sesame seeds and a light lemongrass vinaigrette.  Both dishes were artistically plated.  On to the main course. For me- lamb chops based on all the great fellow yelper reviews.  Two succulent lamb chops with the meaty portion medium rare and slightly separated from the bone. I'm going to say this may have been the best lamb chop I have ever eaten. Again- plating was so creative with a lovely carrot purée at the base and Swiss char as well as the caramelized onions on top- out of this world!    My guest had a classic Canadian Pickering filet with white asparagus and somewhere in the dish was a hint of bacon, so good!  Dessert- their famous coconut cream pie was a must try and did not disappoint.  White chocolate shavings on top and a chocolate swirl underneath makes this cake boss worthy!  My guest had a rhubarb dessert that although I'm not a fan of rhubarb, it was beautiful to look at and by the time I looked up to grab a taste, all gone and rave reviews.  Summary- from start to finish a perfect 5 star experience. Hey, mister Michelin guy- go eat there and give these guys a star!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited as many years as I have before finally trying a restaurant that has consistently appeared in the Toronto Top 10 list annually.  This place is hidden in a condominium with a view from the Avenue Rd. hilltop that gives a surprising and spectacular view of the city skyline from the north.  The ambiance is classy late seventies, early eighties, with velvet upholstered booths and mirrors throughout-  all well maintained.  It reminded me of what going out for a fancy dinner was like with my parents when I was a kid.  The wine list is excellent, with an accompanying sommelier for assistance.  Our table tried many of the appetizers including the Spec, Oysters and Shrimp Salad.  All as expected, with fresh local ingredients.  For entrees, I had the veal with came atop a homemade sour cream spätzle.  The veal was tender and pink, the spätzle stole the show.  Others had the filet and the presentation was outstanding.  They were out of the European Sea Bass.   We all split a gorgeous piece of homemade coconut cream pie for dessert.  What you pay for here is the experience:  the service, view, wine list, and presentation.  We were there to celebrate our daughter's graduation, and will return for similar special occasions."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Toronto!  Scaramouche has an amazing service and an amazing food. It's true that it is relatively pricey but it is very well worth it. It's definitely a place to go to on special occasions. the restaurant is very nice, it has a good view to downtown Toronto, great ambience and of course a high class level food and service. This is a place I'd recommend to anyone to try at least once!"}
{"text":"Great food quality and services. The staff are attentive and the dish presentation are beautiful."}
{"text":"Everything was prepared perfectly.  Everything was delicious.  Service was flawless.  A rare 10/10 at the high end.  Only problem *could* be that they don't change the fundamentals of their menu often enough.  If they changed their menu more often I'd go there more. Or if they made it clearer what the specials would be.  Everything is great, but I'd love to see more variety."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in the city , the food is always amazing , the service is fantastic . I always recommend this place for any special occasion or just a great dinner ! The view is breathtaking ,"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated my big 30th birthday at Scaramouche last weekend.  I would agree with other Yelpers that the food were all classic gourmet dishes, prepared well, and presented nicely, but missing that outstanding wow factor. That said, the signature coconut cream pie was probably the best I've ever had, and I am usually not a fan of coconut! For starters, we tried the raw oysters from Northern Canada and New Zealand, the shrimp and lobster salad crepe, and the pea pecorino ravioli - surprisingly very light yet still flavorful. For entrees, the lamb rack chops and the St. Canut pork were meaty and served with a nice variety of accompaniments. Portion to price value was fine. The cocktails were a bit weak but I didn't mind since I'm a lightweight.  Service was professional and knowledgeable as expected. We arrived late for our reservation (due to our Uber driver and detours), but it was no problem at all. We requested seating by the window and enjoyed the lovely view of the city skyline. They also remembered to add a candle to my dessert! All in all, this is a nice fancy restaurant choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We came here for our 1st anniversary. During reservation, we asked for a table by the window but didn't get it; a bit disappointed.  Food: bread was cold but it's ok. we shared a tartare, a bit fishy. but my main course the partridge was sooooo good :D crispy skin with soft meat... every thing else on the side just complemented so well. Coconut cream pie is good but not as good as expected.  Environment: pretty standard, white cloth table, comfy sofa. but nothing fancy.  Next time will try on the pasta bar side..."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome view of the Toronto skyline.  We had the beet salad, grilled octopus, seafood entree (in a really delicious broth) and banana and oats desert. Everything was delicious. Cleaned the plate for every course."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. When we pulled up I had minimal expectations for this place. Even after looking at the menu i was skeptical of what we would get. The menu was limited to about 8 entrees. But once we ordered and the food came I was highly impressed. The flavors on the plate were amazing and highly unique. I would eat here in a heartbeat. The deserts were delicious as well"}
{"text":"Solid upscale joint.  Service was extremely attentive, although the waitress seemed more snooty than friendly.    Had the Quebec Duck to start and the Venison as an entree.  The waitress provided a good red to pair with the venison.  The flavor of the duck was good and the venison was excellently cooked.  For all of the hype though, the restaurant didn't do anything to stand out at this price point."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and ambience!  This past Saturday, I celebrated my birthday at Scaramouche Restaurant. We were seated near the windows that had a nice view of the city. They started us off with a basket of bread and a complimentary amuse-bouche, which was a smoked salmon puff pastry. We each ordered a glass of Murphy-Goode Cabernet Sauvignon ($15) which went perfectly with our meals.  For our appetizers, we ordered:   Yellowfin Tuna Tartare ($24) - The tuna was light in flavour and not overpowered by the soy marinade. The radish, jicama, coriander and finger lime added a refreshing touch. The avocado purée and crème frâiche were both light and creamy with distinct flavours. And the squid ink tempura crumbs balanced the dish out with a delicious, crunchy texture.   Cavatelli ($22) - The appetizer was a part of their specials of the day which included cavatelli pasta and an assortment of vegetables. The pasta and vegetables were cooked al dente and had light and tangy flavours from the sauce. I personally enjoyed this dish while Kevin wasn't a fan because there were too many vegetables and no meat (haha).  For our mains, we ordered:  Lamb ($48) - My bf ordered the lamb and I was able to try some. The lamb was delicious and juicy, with quite a strong curry flavour on the crust.   Grilled Filet Mignon ($49) - I ordered the Filet Mignon cooked medium rare which came out pre-sliced into three pieces. The steak was cooked beautifully and was very tender. The Bordelaise sauce was smooth and rich in flavour, which went perfectly with the steak.  Since we had movie reservations later on in the night, we decided to go for dessert near the theatre. Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience at Scaramouche, from their fantastic service to their aesthetically pleasing dishes. I would love to go back again and try other delicious menu items!"}
{"text":"Why go anywhere else for a special occasion? Just took my brother here for his 50th. The service, food and view are spectacular. Year over year I have never been disappointed - from cocktails on. Best restaurant in the city. Skip the trendy spots that are so often overrated and go here. It is always not a good experience but truly excellent. My favourite."}
{"text":"My husband brought me to Scaramouche for my birthday dinner, and I am so glad that he did. Everything in this restaurant is amazing from view to service to food.  In appetizers we ordered Shrimp salad to share. As soon as I took the first bite it felt like the explosion of amazing and fresh flavours in my mouth. This was one of the best appetizers dish I've ever had. For the mains I ordered Duck and my husband ordered St. Canut Pork on our servers recommendation. We also ordered a side of whipped potatoes, which were mind blowing. Both the dishes were cooked to perfection. All the little components in the Duck dish like Jerusalem artichokes, pistachios, wild mushrooms and natural jus went very well with the dish and took it to a next level. My husband's dish skin was cooked very nicely and had the perfect crisp. All the flavours of this dish blended in very well. We are a huge mash potato fan and this was the first time when we were scared that we will almost forget to eat our potatoes because both the dishes were absolutely stunning and stole potatoes thunder  My suggestion is do yourself a favour and do visit this place and enjoy a lovely dinner with a beautiful view."}
{"text":"There is a reason why Scaramouche has been around forever!!!!!!!!!!  Although the location is a bit bizarre, the food is probably TOPS for any restaurant in Toronto (it really is hard to find a restaurant in Toronto that will blow your socks off! What's wrong with Toronto!?!).    There are two restaurants in Scaramouche -- a more casual bar area and a fancier dining room.  I've always been lucky enough to eat in the dining room, and it has never disappointed!!!!!  Make sure you try the home-made tagliatele. They usually have some derivative of the home-made pasta available on their menu...the best is when they pair it with their wild mushrooms.....to DIE for!!!!!  But, really, anything on the menu ends up being amazing...I still crave a steak tartar dish they had on the menu last year but never brought back. It was amazing!!!!  Their signature banana cream pie is the BEST in the city!!!! Last time I had it, the crust was a bit tough...but usually this is the reason why we keep coming back.  It hasn't changed over the years -- just pure, creamy, decadent yumminess!!!!!!  Yay, Scaramouche -- you have made me a believer that there is actually a wonderful restaurant in Toronto!!!! I hear you may be moving as your lease is up...just make sure you keep the high standard of food, wherever you end up!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a window seat, but we sat on a corner seating and was very comfortable and had decide view of the city.  Food was good, many complex flavours but well balance  Would recommend the lamb and coconut dessert and shrimp salads   Was a bit disappointed In the non- alcohol cocktail drinks. So minus 1 star.  Would highly recommend this restaurant and server was great!"}
{"text":"Scaramouche is another solid place. The service is always excellent. Drinks are great and the food is lovely. This place deserves international recognition."}
{"text":"I never would have guessed that the first level of a common looking apartment building housed a spectacular restaurant, but one inside you are transformed to just that. High overlooking Toronto, its picture windows presented a pretty view even on a rainy evening.   The service throughout the dinner was impeccable with a team attending to every need yet not obtrusive. The specials of the evening included a mushroom bisque (which we did have) and a tuna entree which we didn't try. The mushroom soup was possibly the best we've had!  Also for an appetizer we had the foie gras terrine which was a pate of buttery consistency accompanies by a brioche and pickled grapes, maple jelly and sour cherry glaze. The contrasting tastes were delicious.   For entrees we has the rack of lamb and the sea scallops. Both were excellent and made more so by the paired vegetables that were on the plates. These standard menu selections seem fine-tuned to perfection.   Yes, we managed to squeeze in desert, their rightly famous coconut cream pie and a lemon pot de cream, both great. We had cocktails and wine by the glass, all which were well appreciated.   Certainly a special occasion venue unless you are ultra-wealthy, but met and exceeded all expectations."}
{"text":"Scaramouche continues to be our \"go-to\" restaurant for the annual anniversary dinner. I would rank as a 4.5 but trending high -- hence the 5 star rating.  The service here is always wonderful.  Best in the city (IMHO).  What we ate: - Colville oysters and the grilled octopus salad to start - the duck breast (with mushroom and foie gras stuffing) and the filet mignon as mains - the coconut cream pie and the Valrhona chocolate mousse  The appetizers and mains were fantastic.   For me their coconut cream pie is \"da bomb\", but I have to say that the Valrhona mousse by comparison looked tiny.  My husband said it was good, but that he needed a magnifying glass to see it (joking of course) -- and since the coconut cream pie is a generous offering -- well I shared!  :)  Service was wonderful, and they gave us a table by the window as requested. Thanks to the management for a wonderful meal!  Note: all parking is Valet, but there is no additional fee to park (other than please tip those valet attendants!)."}
{"text":"We went for my husband's birthday. They have free valet parking which is nice. I loved my fish soup which was just as good as the ones I had in Provence. I also like the sea bass (branzino) and thought the portions of the mains were very generous so go lightly on bread. My husband ordered a dungeon crab ravioli topped with uni and the venison which were delicious. We went with the coconut cream pie for dessert which was good and fresh, I personally do not really like coconut desserts but I recommend it for those who do. The execution of the food was perfect. The atmosphere is conservative but very comfortable. The service has been impeccable. I have a nice view if the city from here. Of course it is a higher price point. I would not say it's a must try but it is a pleasant and tasty experience."}
{"text":"The First time I was ever in Scaramouche was in the late 80s, early 90s when I friend of mine (who lived in the building that Scaramouche uses) shared a drink at the bar. At the time,  I was blown away with the decor and thought to myself then that I would only take that ONE special someone in my life. Fast-Forward to over 20 years later when that Special Someone is now my wife. It was her birthday when I decided that this would be the night 20 years in the making. It was worth the wait.The restaurant reserved us a great table by the window which has the most amazing views of the city skyine. There was complementary Valet and Coat check to add to the over alll great service. We ordered from the Lobsterlicious menu and we were not disappointment in the slightest. I have to say that although all the dish where great my wife's dishes of Soft Spring Roll with lobster, shrimp,avocado, chili, coriander & green mango as an appetizer and Butter Lobsterserved with broad lemon noodle,cauliflower, swiss chard, mushrooms & bacon butter sauce were both absolutely amazing!!! But I won the dessert pick. If you ever come here you have to try the signature dessert of Coconut Cream Pie. It is just the best I've ever had. The service was great and the entire staff was pleasant and professional. The entire night could not have gone better. My wife and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Scaramouche is exceptional and the food was just incredible. Each dish was delicate and savory. Might be the best meal we've ever had. The Service was great from arrival to departure, and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Very expensive restaurant for a young couple date. The crowd was mostly seniors and is located as part of a condo near Yorkville.   The staff were very formal and welcoming. This is definitely a place you should dress up for, however on a weekday, expect senior citizens just hanging out.   My husband had halibut and I had scallops (that's all e could afford without breaking our wallets). The scallops were seared to perfection and covered with cream and butter. The halibut was very tender as if you cut through it like butter.   Do work up an appetite and high budget when you go to this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant boasts unbeatable views, a solid kitchen and impeccable service. It's a reliably wonderful splurge place. The Pasta Bar is the slightly more affordable, slightly more casual arm of a very upmarket venue. Many of Toronto's most noteworthy chefs have worked in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Incredible service, food, and view. We have had many family birthday dinners and here and it has been consistently amazing over the years. You cannot go wrong with the peppercorn fettuccine and, of course, their famous coconut cream pie."}
{"text":"I'm usually not super crazy about fine dining because I would rather buy expensive shoes than expensive food :P My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and you definitely have to be in your best attire and behavior! I usually prefer a more laid-back atmosphere, but this is definitely one of few fine dining experiences that I found top notch, memorable and absolutely worth the money. No complaints really, except the interior decor is kind of bland, but the food makes up for it with the quality and layers of flavors!"}
{"text":"First, I just want to say how difficult it is to get reservations on Valentine's Day. I called more than 2 weeks in advance and the earliest time I could squeeze myself in was at 9:30pm. I figured better later than never though :) Luckily, when they called to confirm my reservation there was a cancellation at 6:30pm (but it wasn't by the window).   Tip:   Plan a month ahead or more for Valentine's Day reservations especially if you want a window seat with view.   With that said, this place is phenomenal and I'm not saying it lightly. I've been to other upscale dining where the presentation is impeccable but the food was not to par. The food here is so amazing I want to say its mind blowing amazing. Vivian Y., you're so right, anything you order here is an excellent choice.   Now to the food. We had the raw oysters for the appetizer. Yum yum yum.   My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with foie gras. I've never liked liver in my life but this liver was so rich, buttery, and delicate it literally melted in your mouth just like the filet mignon. The filet was so tender I didn't even think I was eating meat. Wow just incredible!   I was really sad I was missing the Lobsterlicious special (Monday - Thursday for a limited time) so I recreated my own Lobersterlicious meal by ordering the Lobster Bisque, Pan Roasted Sea Scallops and Butter Poached Lobster, and Coconut Cream Pie. All great choices again. The scallops was huge and the lobster was scrumptious! The Coconut Cream Pie just topped everything off in a good way.   One thing I want to mention is though the portion sizes aren't that big as it is with most fine dining restaurants. I realized though when you eat really good food you don't need quantity because your taste buds are instantly satisfied. The bill with wine indeed was high but we left feeling good and that is really all that matters :)"}
{"text":"Amazing view + perfect service + delicious food = five stars.  I honestly couldn't figure out how this place was going to have a good view.  I mean, everyone's complaining about it being in an apartment building.  But, there it was.  A gorgeous, panoramic view of the Toronto skyline.  Then we met our waiter.  He was delightful.  Charming.  A mind-reader.  And he gave us some excellent culinary tips for our impending meals in Montreal (thank you for recommending the bar seating at Garde Manger!).  Bufala mozzarella - melt in your mouth, just the way bufala should be.  Good texture contrast as well.  Ravioli - al dente. Light. Creamy. Tangy.  There may or may not have been a minor scuffle over who would get the last one (there were only 5 raviolis, about an inch square).  Filet - perfect in every way.  Medium rare, easily cut with my butter knife.  Perfectly whipped potatoes, al dente green beans (everything we got was perfectly cooked), complex, savory bordelaise sauce.  Venison - quality.  Again, medium rare, didn't even have a hint of game-y taste to it.  I actually really liked this dish and didn't think I would.  Coconut cream pie - I, personally, think this dish is overrated.  There is a lot of shaved coconut in the pie and I can't stand the texture of coconut.  However, my dining companion loved it.  To each his own.  Valrhona dark chocolate delice - they had me at dark chocolate. And at peanut butter. And at salted carmel.  Holy heck, it's like they made this dessert for me.  Hands down, best desert I had on the entire trip to Toronto and Montreal.  There wasn't a single thing I didn't absolutely love about it.  So, hopefully you and your dining companion have disparate desert views so you can have the delice all to your (chocolate-loving) self."}
{"text":"This place really really needs a renovation.  Feels like stepping back in time.  The food was good...not amazing.  Felt overly complicated but not complex in flavours.  Service was good.  Would not recommend anyone under 50 to go here."}
{"text":"It was great to eat here again with a great group.  Had a lobsterlicious menu - nothing that made me go WOW - stuck with the steak tartar - perfect combination of sweet and savoury - a nice start - others at the table had the persimmon salad, lobster bisque, tuna - all received well.    Found a great Bordeaux on the wine menu from 2005 that was a perfect bold yet not over-powering addition to all the meals - Great compliments on this choice and affordable vintage ($55/bottle).    Lamb was a popular choice around the table - perfect Quebec lamb, not gamy moist and perfect.  Detached from the ribs, so it was like have 4 portions verses two.    The signature Coconut cream pie, another popular choice at the table for dessert.  Huge portion and obviously made in house - best I've had since my dearly departed Grandmother Turnbull's (a pastry chef and old farm girl).  Service was much better then on a previous visit, non-intrusive and efficient.  This is always important for me when eating out in Toronto.  Service sells and brings me back.    It was odd that they had no truffles in the house for several dishes, but we were informed of this a the start of the meal.  The waiter worked both ends of the table of 8, so no need to try to strain to hear what was being said at one end or the other.  Seeing improvements.  But consistency is important."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great view and an amazing dinner this place is for you.  The Cavatelli was soooo good, the fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, skins crispy but fish flaky!   The peppercorn fettuccini might be the best fettuccini I've ever had, fresh noodles and amazing tenderloin. I'm drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for a special occasion.  French/Italian-inspired dishes with delicious sauces that bring all the items on the plate together. It could improve in some areas though.  It's quite pricey--a table of six with apps and main (no dessert), plus a bottle of wine was almost $600 including taxes and gratuity.  They have valet service and coat check, for which you can also leave tips.  The service in general was good but the restaurant itself didn't really have much character. It's in a very ritzy area attached to a condo in the Yorkville area. I read really good reviews of the service, but our waitress didn't seem that friendly.  She did her job and was professional, but wasn't personable and we didn't really get a \"friendly\" vibe.  The atmosphere was nice, fairly quiet, not crowded.   Food was great.  The flavours around the plate made my halibut dish taste very delicious.  I tasted the lamb that someone got and it was very good as well.  Oyster appetizer was great, octopus was also delicious and flavourful with crispy potatoes underneath. The pork was okay--the skin wasn't crispy at all and kind of chewy. I didn't taste the duck, but apparently it was amazing.  Presentation of the food was spectacular.  Other reviewers mentioned that the crowd is typically older which is generally the case, but I did see a family of four with kids as well.  Again, good place for a special occasion, but probably wouldn't go again anytime soon as it's quite pricey and there are other fine dining restaurants around the city that I'd want to try them first before returning."}
{"text":"What to say that hasn't already been said. Sure the decor is frozen in time and the waiters' uniforms could use a splash of colour, but the view is beautiful! The food is excellent, everything is prepared with the freshest and best ingredients, and with the utmost care. The staff is incredibly attentive; we brought our toddler with us and she was treated like an adult! This is certainly one of the best restaurants in the city. We really enjoyed our experience and hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"I went for a firm dinner and, since I went with Samantha W., I was also a little annoyed about how far away it was from the downtown core. It took about 30 minutes to get there by Uber, and our Uber bill ended up being $35.   Regardless, it was worth the trek - it was by far one of the nicest places I have been to and I really liked the simplicity of the food there. There was nothing offensive or over-the-top, it was just great food. The view out of the restaurant was amazing as well, especially since it was from the basement of this random apartment building in a part of town that I can never afford to live in. Anyhow, everyone there is dressed in business casual - if you are like me and hate dressing up for meals, this place might just be worth putting on a dress shirt for (no tie needed).  But before I share my experience about the food, I need to talk about the waiter. One of the people with me accidentally made a motion to shoo the waiter away as the waiter showed him the bottle of wine he ordered. He later apologized for it, not knowing that his action could have been construed as rude. When he apologized to the waiter, the waiter profusely apologized for his tardiness with the wine and for his \"poor service\" for about 2 full minutes. WOW - I have never had such courteous service at a restaurant before. I have been to \"fine dining\" places in Paris and this was far superior.   The food that I had were: the Beef Carpaccio, the Daily Special (Seared Yellowfin Tuna), and I also had some of the coconut pie. They also did not skimp on the portions at all. I wont go into depth about any of the items because they were all just amazing. I was actually given a piece of filet mignon by a colleague and my god, it was as soft as the tuna. Last time I remembered, fish was supposed to be softer than beef - so I am at a loss for words.  If I were to have a restaurant cater for my wedding (and if I had all the money in the world) I would pick this place.  My only gripe is that I ordered a Moscow Mule (how dare I order such a unrefined drink at this place). The Moscow Mule did not come in a copper mug. As such, I did not drink it - I didn't complain about this but I'm sure if I did they would have apologized profusely. Anyways, who cares about that - the place is fantastic."}
{"text":"The street that I live on is sandwiched between two main drags in the city - one is mostly condominiums and apartments and the other is full of shops and restaurants.    Scaramouche - snuck its way into one of the high-rises on the non-retail side of the sandwich in the early nineties - according to its décor - and has not moved, or changed since.  This upscale, frozen in time restaurant, whose patrons seem to have aged (perhaps having undergone a few more facelifts than Scaramouche itself) with the establishment, has quality on its side.  The food is expensive but wonderful and the crowd is classic (and by that I mean old) Toronto snobbery at its best.  If you are young, yearning to spend money on excellent food and seeking to stick your nose up at those who are classically trained in proboscis promotion, then Scaramouche gives you that rare but lovely chance."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant experience I've ever had in Toronto.   Where else in this city can you eat fantastic, complex, creative food, enjoy a great reasonably priced wine list and incredible cocktails all served by competent, informed, intelligent, entertaining and respectful servers? The answer is nowhere. Scaramouche is the complete package.  The only negatives quickly turn into positives once the restaurant's charms take over. The dining room is VERY 80s, and not on purpose, that just happens to be when it was designed. Somehow, it begins to suit the place once you settle in. Scaramouche hasn't changed to match trends, it is confident in what it is and for good reason. In addition, some of their cocktail names were a bit corny (innocent innuendo) and included \"saucy\" descriptors (sensual, etc), but were so damn good, all was forgiven at first sip.  The view of the city is second to none. The feel is relaxing, lots of couples, wealthy families, people celebrating important events. Definitely a special occasions-type place.  Crab ravioli, oysters and mushroom pasta to start. Tuna special and scallops as mains. Coconut cream  pie for desert. The ONLY complaint was that the pie crust was a bit tough, but that is, literally, my only complaint.   Dinner for 2 all in was 350 bucks, but honestly, you get what you pay for here. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been in here over 6-10 times always great service. The coconut pie is a must. Pasta was very good and Bison steak."}
{"text":"I've been to many different restaurant, and have tried many different foods. But this just might be the best meal I ever had. Very expensive, but very worth it. The explosion of flavors in the dressing/sauces, the succulent meats, the perfectly prepared vegetables, literally everything about this place was outstanding."}
{"text":"We were frankly underwhelmed by both the service and quality of food. I am not sure whether we went in with high expectations or just did not order the right stuff from the menu. The place was packed on a weeknight even though it is located smack in a quiet residential neighborhood. I ordered the lobsterlicious menu and was very disappointed with the quality of the 3 course meal. My wife had the ala carte options - scallops and halibut which were the saving graces of the night. Take my advice - do not order the scallop dish with lobster reduction from the lobsterlicious menu, instead order the regular scallops appetizer and you will conclusively pick a winner. The main lobster course was a hotchpotch of flavors that did not jive well. The portion sizes were justified given the high price on the entrees. The halibut was beautifully seared but there was a bitter component on the plate that left a lingering foul taste. For dessert we had the pistachio meringue which was interesting. We found the service to be inconsistent since the servers were simply putting the plates in front of us without explaining the components of the dish. The table next to us were celebrating a special occasion and they got the full detail on the dishes they ordered.  When we asked the server to call a cab for us, he informed us it would take 10 minutes to arrive but never bothered checking back with us on whether or not it actually arrived. We ultimately had to figure out the cab situation ourselves and ended up getting a ride that was meant to be for a different person :)"}
{"text":"The following is my menu at Scaramouche:  Amuse (sorry can't remember but it was very good)  Foie gras terrine, duck breast pastrami, French figs, pickled grapes, sea salt brioche, sour cherry syrup, maple jelly  Lobster special (1 1/4 lb removed from shell), gnocchi, white asparagus  Lemon cream, yogurt sorbet, blood orange segments, elderflower jelly  Very much enjoyed my dinner at Scaramouche, but in comparison to my other meals (both lunch and dinner), it was the \"safest\" of my meals. Service was very nice and attentive. Water glass was refilled every time it reached the halfway mark. Food was executed extremely well. Flavors were excellent for the foie gras and lobster. I found the dessert a bit weak. I know I should have ordered the coconut cream pie, but I've never been much of a fan of any cream pies."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and loved it. The food wasn't full of mouth exploding flavored, hence the 4 stars, but the view, service, atmosphere, and strength of the cocktails were phenomenal. This place has an amazing view of the city and allows you to bring out those expensive heels that you wouldn't generally wear. The service is top notch, very attentive and not rushed. For apps we got the scallops and they were so delicious but next time I probably won't split it. I got the partridge, it was very filling and perfect for fall. My boyfriend got the halibut it was a light dish and the sauce was great. For dessert we had to get the coconut cream pie everyone was raving about, I wasn't crazy about it. The technique and finesse are award winning but the not something I'd get again. Another big win,LISTEN UP AMERICANS, if you pay in American dollars they will adjust it for their currency so rather than paying more just because you have dollars you pay what you would pay in America."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Toronto. I've been too this restaurant many times and only the the last time I went was I slightly disappointed but still deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business with a colleague and had the opportunity to return to Scaramouche. Believe or not the last time I dined at the restaurant was in 1988! We were unable to plan in advance so we did not have reservations. We sat in a less formal area they call the Pasta Bar.   Dinner was EXCELLENT.  I had an amazingly fresh pasta dish that was corn and cremini mushroom filled ravioli topped with bacon, fresh shell beans and fresh corn. I had the cod for my main dish.   Food was a great value. Toronto is expensive! The house NV French champagne was excellent.  Service was excellent at the outset but became very flaky (she disappeared) after the main course was served. Getting a dessert menu and the check was a struggle with patience.   Without the above drop in what otherwise was perfect service and meal, I would give this restaurant and unqualified five stars. Instead I would drop it to 4.5 were it possible."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of, if not the, best meals I've had in Toronto.  My wife and I went there for our two year anniversary.   Between the amazing view, professional staff, incredible wine selection,  outstanding food and to-die-for desert we had a perfect evening.   There is no need in my opinion to try to explain how good it is but to simply say to anyone reading this that you must try this restaurant out!  Shout-out to the chef and pastry chef!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been to Scaramouche twice in my life, and both times, I've been underwhelmed.   This is a Toronto institution with a lot of history, attracting a lot of Old Toronto as well. There's elegant charm with the interior, the view, being the first restaurant in a condo, etc.   Where the place falls short for me personally is the food. The menu is really somewhat dated. There's a lack of creativity, and the focus really is perfection. As a result, you're getting ambiance, you're getting service, but there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to food. For example, I will agree that the coconut cream pie is good but not life changing as some indicate. It's not elegant, it really is just a slice of cream pie. Caviar, while at an excellent price point, is served effectively on salty deep fried chips with all the traditional accompaniments on top like it were nachos - it's a really failed attempt at trying to modernize the wrong dish. The seafood entree, get's lost in itself with too many competing flavours.   There's definitely a need, in  my opinion, to take a risk and get a little more creative.   A solid 3.5 however. The service and atmosphere elements are on point."}
{"text":"Probably the best pasta bar in Toronto. Great coconut pie as dessert. I've been here multiple times and tried most of pastas on the menu, I really do recommended all of their pasta. Other stuff aren't that impressive, salad, appetizers are not as good as their restaurant. But for the price, I would definitely go back for pasta."}
{"text":"VIBE  Well, what can we say about this institution that has been in the industry for over 30 years that hasn't really already been said? First of all it really is all about its location. Benvenuto Place is the place of mythical Toronto. You don't believe it exists until you go and once you go, you're at a condo building. A restaurant in a condo building? Yes.  But what a genius idea because that view is phenomenal.  The secret -- it's down the street from the high school Del La Salle. Who knew?   If you want to see the CN Tower and the Toronto skyline in all of its glory, this is the place you go. It's where you're brokering that deal; making that proposal (or accepting it; or not accepting it) and celebrating some momentous occasions. And yes, there is a balcony. I wish I went out on it but I felt a little bit like a kid on Christmas Day excited to see the view I had not yet seen of my beloved city and didn't want to break through the door. So I stayed as mature as I could.   It is the one of the few old school, classic white linen type of restaurants left in Toronto but I will say that the pasta bar section has bit of a relaxed attitude. And the decor accents are modern. Another note: the seating is very comfortable.   And yes, the restaurant has two sections 1. The Pasta Bar 2. The regular restaurant.  But let's not confuse \"pasta bar\" with all-you-can-eat and pick-your-own-sauce styles a la Tucker's Marketplace (one reason I love Tucker's Marketplace; I digress).  It's just the more \"relaxed\" side of the restaurant with a few more pasta options than the fancier fare of the other section.  You get a traditional menu and all.   Service is A Plus. The servers are professional and articulate without being stuffy, though at times I felt there were a few more hands than needed clearing off the table. (I get it: teamwork).   WE ATE  We came on a mission for coconut cream pie and coconut cream pie we ate. Soft, white delicious, creamy stuffing with just the right amount of coconut flavouring you'd feel like you were in a Beach Boys video (anyone? Kokomo?). It is the Messiah of all desserts and we were glad we came for the quest. We ate the ginormous pie (three of us shared one dessert) and we savored and appreciated it down to its crust for what it was. It really does deserve punctuation for the end of each word. Coconut. Cream. Pie.   But of course, with our bunch of food lovers, we got distracted by the main menu and decided to go all out. Two friends had the Yellow Fin Tuna, which seemed light and refreshing; my friend had the Eggplant Caponata --garlic crostini/whipped buffalo ricotta/fine olive oil/Maldon sea salt. I was lucky to have a little taste and the power of flavour in this dish was strong and memorable. If I go back, I'd have this.   My dish was:  Fresh Maltagliati Pasta -- wild mushrooms/spinach/leeks/toasted bread crumbs/Parmesan porcini sauce. The pasta was a wide noodle and was easy to sop off all the sauce. I really liked the texture of the dish; the creaminess of the sauce, leeks and spinach that complimented the crunchiness of the bread crumbs. And it smelled so delicious. But though it did have flavour, I wanted to put more pepper on it. It was just missing that hint. It was a solid dish but I would try something else next time.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  One of those places you can't not visit if you live in Toronto. A true classic in a sea of more casual, modern restaurants in the city and an absolutely spectacular view. There's a reason that Frogget's customers rallied for him when the condo owners were trying to raise his rent and push him out of the building.  A Note: the famous Lobsterlicious is back from January 9, 2012 for $62. Sounds amazing! http://www.scaramoucherestaurant.com/menus-recipes/lobsterlicious"}
{"text":"The food is not bad. I would give 3.5 stars for the food. But I would give a 5 star to their service.  Free valet parking btw. The dinner comes with a lil amuse bouche which was pretty good."}
{"text":"What can I write about Scaramouche that's not already been written?  It's in the basement of a nondescript apartment building. Everything else is anything but nondescript.  The view of downtown Toronto is gorgeous.  The food is simple and simply delicious.   The service is excellent: attentive without being overly fussy and truly makes the customer feel like a king. The servers never rushed us, and seemed happy to wait on us. Other restaurants could take a page out of Scaramouche's service book. Canoe I am looking at you. --------------  Our party of 4 was seated beside the windows, so we basked in the visual of the skyline coming to life as the sun set.  I greatly enjoyed my Yellow Fin sashimi appetiser : thick slabs of buttery, top grade fish perfectly garnished with vinaigrettes and soya sauce. The crab cakes, steak tartare and soup ordered by the rest of the crew received vigorous thumbs up.  I relished my rack of lamb.It was cooked to medium rare perfection (without my asking). Loved the crispy crust and the spicy eggplant relish.   Since they hadn't asked us how we wanted the lamb cooked, one of our party found the medium rare cut not to her liking at all. Our server immediately and apologetically took back the dish and brought it back cooked to perfection. Fully cooked yet juicy and not leathery.  My other friends greatly enjoyed their halibut (with perfectly charred skin and served on a bed of salad) and buttery scallop mains (the latter, a bit stingy in portion size).  For desert we ordered coconut cream pies all around! The pies live up to their hype: excellently smooth, not overpoweringly coconutty and very generously sized. None of us could finish our pies and doggy bagged them home.  The decor, the food, the service : everything was earnest and unpretentious. Scaramouche is secure in the knowledged that by getting the fundamentals right it  stands out and is head and shoulders above 99.9% of the younger lot that trips over itself trying to be molecular/gastronomic/insert-complicated-and fancy-word-of-choice-here.  P.S. We bumped into Eugene Levy on our way in and out, which topped off the evening for one of my friends!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine included Scaramouche in his list of possible Michelin Star contenders in Toronto, alongside the likes of Alo and Chabrol. My expectations were set pretty high, and they didn't come close.  I'm giving four stars simply because I feel it's unfair to give any decent fine dining establishment a three-star rating. With that said, I wouldn't recommend it, nor was I blown away by the food or service.    The venue and atmosphere, however, were impressive. It's in a very unassuming old condo building, so when you walk into the actual restaurant you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Our server was, frankly, very poor. My sister asked to try wine that he recommended and he declined. I am flour free (not gluten free) and asked if there was a substitute for a specific part a dish, and he recommended another dish. He eventually made accommodations, but took awhile to understand. We also waited extensively to take our orders, and we weren't asked once how our meal was. He kept trying to up-sell us wine, and it just became awkward. Perhaps he was new, but these are the little things you expect at a fine dining establishment.  We had the lobster, the scallops, and the filet mignon. The lobster was a bit cold and not super flavourful, the scallops were nice but not extraordinary, the filet mignon was good. The potatoes with the filet mignon were outstanding, as was the sauce and beans.   I'm aware I'm being very critical, but if I was the owner I'd want to hear about these experiences, and do whatever I could to improve them."}
{"text":"Amazing gin & tonic made with specialty, hard to get tonic water. Great service. Delicious food. I'll be back for sure!!.. even if only for the gin & tonic."}
{"text":"I was worried I had found another fine dining restaurant in Toronto that charges NYC prices for Kansas City quality. Although the prices here are on the higher end I feel they are totally justified. My mind wasn't blown by some Avant Garde cuisine but the portions and consistency warrant them. Scaramouche is classic and classy. Everything was delicious and elegant but like I said it wasn't mind blowing."}
{"text":"Scaramouche specializes in modern French/Italian fusion cuisine with a Canadian twist. I Located in the ritzy Yorkville neighborhood, the city view is quite impressive! The food was exquisite, with a few standouts;  For my appetizer, I ordered the butter poached lobster. This was the standout out of all the appetizers. The lobster was cooked perfectly but that lobster sabayon was extraordinary. The texture was that of velvet and tasted like a magical potion of distilled shellfish essence! The fresh shaved fennel and orange salad were a nice contrast to the rich lobster.  Whenever I see venison on the menu, I just have to order it! I personally love the taste but it's an uncommon red meat on menus. The bacon wrapped loin was served rare and tender. The red wine braised neck, however, was stringy. I would have liked to see more brussel sprouts than just a stingy few pieces of outer leaves. The duo of sauces was redundant, just the presence of the red wine venison jus would have been sufficient.  Scaramouche's signature dessert is the coconut cream pie, and with good reason. Layers of luscious custard topped with coconut cream, toasted shredded coconut meat, and a crisp shortcrust pastry bottom. I liked that the pie wasn't overly sweet. The portion was very generous too, as you can easily split it among two people.   Scaramouche made my 23rd birthday celebration very enjoyable and I look forward coming back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 2 year anniversary.  She's was stuck in Toronto on training since November, so I had to find a suitable place in unfamiliar territory.  I couldn't ask her for a recommendation since it was going to be a surprise.  I talked to a few of her friends and did some research online, and this was one of the recommended places to go for a romantic dinner date.    Reservations were highly recommended, but when I went online to make a reservation, no slots for 7pm were available.  I waited until the next morning and called the restaurant directly.  I informed them that I was celebrating my anniversary in Toronto, and Scaramouche HAD to be the restaurant we celebrated at.  The charm seem to work since they said they would accommodate us and ensured that we'd have an unforgettable evening.  We were staying downtown, so we just cabbed it to the restaurant.  It does look like valet is the way to go.  I didn't even notice any parking directly outside the restaurant.    After coat check, they escorted us to our seats.  There is a dining room and a pasta bar/grill.  These are two different dining experience, so make sure you choose correctly.  Both areas have different menus.  Dress code in the dining room is more dressy and the pasta bar is more business cashual/trendy.  We went w/ the dining room since we were celebrating an occasion.    They sat us right next to the window, so we got a great view of the Toronto Skyline.  If you reserve in advance, be sure to ask for a window seat.  Since I was drinking alone, I just went w/ some mixed cocktails, but it looks like wine is the way to go.  The wine menu was about 4+ pages long.   Our drinks came out within minutes w/ bread and butter.  The first course menu looked appealing.  We were initially going to go w/ the mixed lettuce salad, but that was before the server mentioned the specials.  The wife ended up getting the warm chick pea soup, and I ended up getting lobster cakes off of the specials menu.  The soup came garnished w/ tomatoes, capers, and quail eggs.  The wife isn't too adventurous, so she requested that they hold the quail eggs.    As we were waiting, the server came back to check if I ate quail eggs (which I did).  A few minutes later, he came back w/ a mixed green salad w/ quail eggs and real bacon bits.  This was a very considerate gesture since by purchasing the soup, a good % of the $ you are spending for the soup is going to the quail eggs.  The petite salad itself was great.  Not sure if you can order this straight up.  Might want to check w/ the server if you are interested.  I didn't try the soup, but the wife said she was pleased w/ it.  The lobster cakes were outstanding.  It was served w/ a house guacamole and remoulade sauce.  Perfectly crisp on the outside and nice and lumpy on the inside.  I could've eaten the cakes as an entree.    My wife's dinner selection was easy since she doesn't each much red meat or seafood.  She ended up going w/ the breast of free range chicken.  It was either that or a veggie pasta dish for her.  I was torn between the roasted lamb and the filet mingon, but ended up going w/ the filet.  No regrets whatsoever about my selection.  The steak was cooked to order and came in a Bordelaise sauce.  It was served on top of a bed of whipped potatoes and was accompanied w/ green beans and grilled onion.  Definitely one of the better tasting filets I've ever eaten.  The wife's chicken was also superb.  She gave me a sample and I feel I could've ordered that as my dish.  It came w/ a nice creamy gorgonzola sauce that you'll want to swim in.    Even though we were both stuffed @ this point, the server convinced us to get a dessert since it was a special night.  We went w/ his recommendation which was the Baked Chocolate Mousse.  The wife is more of a dessert buff than I am, but we both really enjoyed the dessert.  It is served warm with crisp coffee semifreddo, caramel sauce and a chocolate tuile.   What made this extra special is they wrote \"happy anniversary\" with the sauce on the serving plate w/ out me even asking.  This might be cheesy to some, but the wife loved it so it scored points for me :-).    We wrapped up dessert and then took care of the check.  This is not a cheap dining experience, so bring plenty of cash or plastic.  Remember to account for valet and gratuity for coat check.    The restaurant entrance itself is not off a main street.  This combined w/ the fact that was snowing on the night we went was going to make it difficult to call a cab.  I asked one of the gentlemen whats the best way to catch a cab, and he told us to just wait by the front door and he'll call one for us.  I just wanted to point out this nice gesture from the staff.  Summary: Overall a great dining experience.  Key notes:  ~ a great restaurant for a romantic dinner in Toronto.   ~ great personable service ~ great food"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this restaurant. The view of downtown Toronto is gorgeous and service was great, which makes for a great \"date spot\" restaurant. However, for the price paid, the food was just mediocre, tasty and well executed yes, but still mediocre. I feel it lacks the \"surprise\" or \"presentation wow factor\" or \"innovative\" element to be considered one of the absolute top restaurants in Toronto. Nevertheless the top quality raw products, cooked traditionally and properly, did taste delicious, as they should.   Finally, I agree with other yelpers that the coconut cream pie is a must have. The portion size is huge and the taste is hard to describe to give it justice. Imagine the lightest coconut mousse combined with the most decadent custard cream layer, topped with coconut whipped cream and copious amounts of white chocolate shards and toasted coconut.... absolute delight to eat. I almost want to come here and just get that to go, nothing else.   Anyways, if you want to have a more dressy dinner and great ambience for a special occasion with non-picky eaters (ie you parents or maybe that business executive you hate) you really can't go wrong with this restaurant. But if you and fellow foodies friends are coming to critique it's food... prepared to be underwhelmed, except for that coconut pie:)"}
{"text":"Everything was so perfect, by the time we arrived and were greeted by the valet parking staff to the service received at the table, food, and ambiance.  We enjoyed all the drinks and dishes - lobster salad, special grilled salmon first course, lamb, partridge and Fois gras, and of course the famous Coconut Cream Pie. Actually the coffee was very good too.   Special thanks to the restaurant to arrange the window seats for us, so that we had a very memorable Anniversary celebration.   Highly recommend to celebrate your special days there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Varied, imaginative menu. Adequate wine list. Food on part with what you'd expect from a top restaurant. Didn't distinguish itself. Ambiance was stuffy. Views of skyline were nice, but only really enjoyable from select window-side tables. Service was top notch, world class. Portions were appropriate. Meal was overpriced. Wine list was fairly priced. Worth a go. Not my favorite."}
{"text":"This review is for the Lobsterlicious event which ran as the same time as Winterlicious. Was $72/head for lobster based apps and main, and dessert.  I knew this was one of the top ranked restos in Toronto but didnt realize it was that...formal. My dining companion felt awkward about not wearing a dinner jacket. I was wearing enough loud make-up to look like I'd tried ...luckily.   We had a lobster salad crepe and a bisque to start. Both very very good but my pick was the bisque. For mains we got grilled and poached lobster each. Gorgeous. And came removed from the shell for ease of eating.   Capped off with a creme brule and ice cream dessert.  Special occasion worthy. Just bring a jacket."}
{"text":"\"Scaramouche, Scaramouche can you do the Fandango? Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening for me\".-Bohemian Rapshody  Yup we went here on a stormy night ...and no regrets...  Tucked amongst a crowded condominium corridor, the restaurant is situated in the basement of a condo high rise...very misleading, the interior decor isn't as modern or artsy as many high end eateries in the city.  This place is hard to reserve on weekends and in particular for dinner times- a few days in advance is recommended to do the reservation.  Scaramouche is rated highly by both Yelp and TripAdvisor reviewers. It has been a top rated restaurant in Toronto for years. Actually rated number 1 recently and we can see why.   The restaurant is divided into two restaurants: fine dining and pasta, bar and grill style ( which is a bit more affordable). The latter still hard to reserve too.  Great selection of wine! Better bang for your buck to order a bottle or half of one since a glass of wine (6 oz at most) is costly.  We came here on a birthday celebration. We tried each other's choices. Try their popular duck and vineson dinners. Add their coconut cake with a glass of Porto and Capuccino.  The service was impeccable from our  very knowledgeable waiter to the bus boys who cleaned and put away our finished meals and made sure that our wine and water were filled.  Depending the time of your  dinner, Scaramouche gives it's patrons either wholesome wheat or Rye bread or a salmon tar tar to start with and is given for free.  Due to its location, it is hard to find parking but there is a complimentary valet parking ( just give a tip) $$$$ easy."}
{"text":"Tried 3 different dishes and was SUPER impressed.  A pretty penny but totally worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 Nice staff, nice view on TO, but pretty noisy when packed (you will have to shout to talk with friends on the other edge of your table if you are seated in the comfy \"couches\"). very well done meals, tasty, fresh, perfectly cooked, in quite generous amounts (you will leave full as opposed to some such other classy places like this one), including for lobster! Why not five...? I do not know... I missed the wooed factor, perhaps would I have been happier with more sauce on the meals (or at least the option to get more). Or perhaps because the service was quite long that busy day I went there. Would I come back? probably/surely, for a select dinner."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner at Scaramouche.  That is, the food was amazing. The service was sub par. I was actually shocked at the lack of attention provided by the staff - along with the management. I couldn't even tell you who our server was, as no one introduced themselves, including the management.  We sat for about 15 minutes before a drink order was even taken.  The food was exceptional - but the atmosphere and service is severely lacking for a restaurant that is ranked so highly. We left very disappointed."}
{"text":"After reading countless reviews of Scaramouche on Yelp and other, not-so-popular sites that claimed Scaramouche to be #1 restaurant of Toronto, I HAD to try! On a whim, I made a reservation a few hours in advance of our desired time and fortunately there was availability.   This is a very high-end restaurant for special locations. The service here is impeccable, 5 star service all night long.   I would describe the food as French inspired but not true French cuisine. For dinner, we had a four course meal. Started out with the BEST foie gras terrine - it is served with a buttery croissant and sprinkled with sea salt. The foie melts in your mouth and it was perfectly executed.  There was also a daily oyster special and we happily obliged the half-dozen fresh oysters. The oysters are served with ground horseradish instead of traditional cocktail sauce.  The main course was black sea bass and suckling pig. Both dishes like the appetizers were stunning and full of flavors. Ended the meal with a strawberry shortcake and chocolate mousse.  I only had one minor issue - I requested iced tea without knowing that they individually brew cups of tea. The wait time for the tea was longer than expected and so my second glass arrived with dessert; be sure to flag down your server for more tea when you have 5 minutes or so of food remaining.   Highly recommend Scaramouche to anybody travelling to Toronto. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed. Server was knowledgeable and fun and the food and ambience was spectacular.   Highlights: the duck, the lamb, the foie gras, the coconut cream pie and the service"}
{"text":"Great food, very poor service, had to wait almost half an hour for someone to take our order. Only filled our water glasses twice over 2.5 hrs. Waiter did not ask if I wanted more wine. Everything extremely slow despite the restaurant clearing out toward end of the night."}
{"text":"I get the whole traditional/classic thing, but I'm going to have to side more with Erin on this one than the rest of the reviews. The food and service was good, but I wasn't blown away.  If I was, maybe I wouldn't even have noticed the white tablecloth, outdated look.  I'd heard a lot about this place and wanted to try it for a while so I was expecting a lot. We went there for a business dinner this week and I can't say it lived up to the hype.   On the good side, the servers and wine were superb.  The food was in the middle; good, but not as good as expected. I had the steak tartar, lamb, and coconut cream pie (the latter two signature dishes recommended by the server). I should mention one of my colleagues ordered off the lobsterfest menu and was thrilled.   And then there's the classic ambience, or should I say the excuse not to renovate. No reason a restaurant of this stature shouldn't update itself a little. A shame really, cause with that amazing back window and view they could really do something spectacular here with a small investment.  So all in all, would I go there again? Sure, probably one of the first places I'll think of when my parents are in town and I take them to dinner. But other than that, not likely. At least not for another 20 years, or maybe if a significant other insisted."}
{"text":"A hidden star, Scarmouche delivers flavor and service to an upscale Forest hill clientele. The ambiance is a but outdated but the food is excellent and I feel like a king. Voted as best restaurant out of 100 by Joanna Kate's in 2011, I tend to prefer the more trendy establishments as it suits my age an therefor disagree personally with her list.  We ate the appetizer pasta, steak tartar, lamb, partirage and Ontario rhubarb."}
{"text":"I doubt I can say anything that hasn't been said about Scaramouche already.  The food is outstanding: from perfectly crusted scallops to delicate, delicious sauces, everything was at a stellar level of quality and flavour.  The quality of the food we ate was among the highest I've had in the city.  The service was gracious and perfectly timed.    It's a perfect special occasion restaurant, and the perfect place to experience the meticulous rigor and pride involved in French cuisine."}
{"text":"I went to both The Grill and the Pasta Bar. At the grill, I got the octopus which is one of the best I've ever head, around the world. For main course, I got the halibut that was also very delicious. My friend got the lamb which I tried that was also good but I didn't think it was that special. For dessert, I tried the famous coconut cream pie and it really was spectacular.  At the Pasta bar, I was thinking of getting prosciutto as an appetizer but when I heard that the dish is literally only a few pieces of meat, I decided not to (I wish they brought some cheese or something else with it, then I would have definitely ordered it). Instead, we ordered pappardelle and fettuccine. Pappardelle specifically was super delicious! We got the honey & milk dessert that was for me too sugary.  Overall, great food but you need to pick the right dishes. Good service and cool ambience!"}
{"text":"Scaramouche lies in the corner of a residential building. So unless you know about it, you won't be able to spot it on your own. The interior of the restaurant was nice, the decorations were exquisite but a little dark, very little. If you get a chance you can sit next to the window which has the view of downtown.

{"text":"Went to Scaramouche, treated by a friend as a birthday gift. I'm lucky to have such amazing friends! I have recently been disappointed by some highly-rated restaurants and was afraid that Scaramouche would fall short. It didn't.    Entering into the restaurant, closer inspection under bright lights would reveal a slightly dated decor, but we weren't there for modern furniture or innovative lighting - we were there to enjoy one of the most storied and well-reviewed restaurants in the city, if not the nation. Besides, the view of the city skyline from our table more than made up for it.   The dining room was casually elegant. The air on a thursday night was light, conversational, and as not hushed or reserved as I would have expected.   We decided to share our three courses. Or it was decided for me. I can't recall. Either way, we decided each of the three courses democratically, picking our top two dishes and splitting them 50/50.   For an appetizer, we ordered the Nova Scotia lobster and the Quebec duck plate. These two appetizers balanced each other well; the duck plate was closer to a charcuterie plate. Although the fois gras terrine was the advertised highlight of the plate, we both agreed that the duck breast pastrami could be eaten all day, every day. The lobster dish had the same result - the lobster was perfectly cooked, but the outstanding item (for me) was the feather-light gnocchi.   For our main courses, we chose the roast partridge and the blue sea bass. The partridge was perfect, especially the leg which was cooked confit. The sea bass seemed a bit overcooked, but not a being frequent orderer of fish makes me a bit hesitant to knock a star or two off the rating! Otherwise the sea bass dish was delicious, especially the saffron white wine herb nage which bathed the fish and squid.   By the time we made it to dessert, a single order of coconut cream pie was all we could fit into our extremely satiated bellies. As advertised, the coconut cream pie cannot be missed. Not only was it tasty, but the serving size was gargantuan.   A great wine list complimented the incredible food and we enjoyed a glass of Pinot Bianco and a Malbec, each a part of a wine list which was fairly priced, much to my surprise.   Service-wise, we were very well looked without being overshadowed. From the coat check to the water refills and the table side manner, service is familiar, attentive, and professional without pretension.   Bottom line - based on my visit to Scaramouche and that of every friend who I've talked to about their visits there, I can say that it was a near-perfect meal. The entire experience - food, drink, service, view, and company - made it one of the most memorable meals of my life."}
{"text":"I went there because they said it's the number one recommended restaurant in Toronto. The view of the city is beautiful, and luckily we got the windows seat. The service and food is great. Personally, I think the wait for the food is kind of long, but I understand it's French cuisine. I like to eat my food without a gap, so that's just me. Also, the soup I ordered was cold(I didn't pay attention to the menu), even though I was expecting warm soup, but it was surprisingly delicious and flavorful. The way they prepare food is contemporary, unique, and delicious. I would go back again when I visit Toronto again. Also, the valet service is prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Since I couldn't find any michelin star restaurants in Toronto, I figured Sacramouche would be as close as I could get to fine dining. Unfortunately I was extreme disappointed with my experience. It's pretty expensive here and the food is mediocre at best. Service was excruciatingly slow as well.   We started off with free bread- pretty standard. Next came the amuse bouche- a quail egg with bacon bits. This was pretty tasty. For the appetizer we ordered the tuna special with fried chicken. The chicken was very good, but the tuna was too salty for me. I expected way better given the dish was basically $25 for 2 tiny pieces of tuna and 3 small pieces of chicken.   Next came the huge and unbelievable 45-ish minute wait to get our main entrees. I've never had to wait this long in my life at any fine dining restaurant for food. When the entrees finally came out they were a pretty big let down. The lobster and halibut fish was so tough to eat that my boyfriend said his teeth hurt from all the chewing. This never happens with seafood since it's not supposed to be hard to chew. The sauce was too strong in this dish for our liking as well. The other bass special that we got was much better, but nothing stood out.   Overall pricey and super slow service. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"WOW. I think marriage proposals happen here....  First, let me say that I do not experience fine dining very much. But when I do, I enjoy fine dining restaurants who go above and beyond to provide us with the whole experience--the etiquette, the timing, the pairings with wine, the service, a brief description of what I'm supposed to taste before eating each dish, and of course, the Chef's Prefixed menu full of amazing delectable surprises with a whole lot of TLC.   Second, this was my first time visiting Toronto (from California!) to see a very special friend of mine and he enjoys experiencing these kinds of experiences with an equally appreciative food connoisseur.  So the most fun thing about a Prefixed Chef's menu is that there are so many elements of surprise. I LOVE not knowing what I'm going to get in addition to trying dishes that I would possibly never have ordered before. This option is meant for foodies who love eating with an open mind :)  And OMG--the next set of dishes that came out on our particular night was AH-MAZING!  Why don't we start off with the mini teaser which was a rich poached quail egg with light bits of bacon and an out-of-this-world sauce that came on a cute, porcelain soup spoon. I actually do not like quail eggs, so this was a HUGE surprise to me.   Then why don't we get into the SHAVED TRUFFLE fennel salad?! This was the first time I've actually seen SHAVED truffle and now I feel absolutely spoiled to have experienced that. A beautiful balance of truffle oil, truffles, and a nice crunch from the fennel.   Since I experienced this restaurant in March, I am unsure what the order of dishes was from here on out. But I do know that the other dishes were: - A fresh and nicely-portioned tuna tartar - Perfectly prepared and flavorful swordfish - A nice portion of partridge  - OMG, the best Foie Gras I have ever had--beautifully rich, but not overpowering. I still have dreams about it! - And homemade rhubbard ice cream garnished with poached rubbard--tangy more than sweet.  Throughout this heavenly ordeal, we also had a different glass of wine paired with each dish! I believe this option is an additional $75/person.  Since it was a treat for a special occasion, I was not allowed to ask the price of this whole experience...but according to my  fine-dining veteran, the experience far outweighed the cost of the meal.   I've also experienced fine dining restaurants where I feel the price of the food does not match the quality of the service nor the food itself. So this was definitely an experience to write home about.  Oh, and a table reserved near the water for an amazing view was also beautiful....but it failed in comparison to the FOOD!!  Highly recommended for that special occasion or date you REALLY want to impress."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a preshow dinner here recently to partly celebrate my birthday, and an evening away from the kids.  I had heard of it but was pushing for Canoe. And for French, my go to is normally La Palette, but I haven't been to that since it moved from Augusta St.  Let me say I was happy to be overruled. The view from the Avenue Road hill was great, and the neighbourhood is long familiar to me. We had a good table in the pasta bar side.  I ordered the oysters, which I had been told are well worth ordering, and I was not disappointed.  Huge, chilled and fresh, very tasty, and accompanied by a great, chunky, firey seafood sauce.  Madam had the Romaine heart salad which had a great Caesar dressing.   For mains I ordered sea bass, which was cooked and presented perfectly. The garnish was also tasty, including something made from capers - can't go wrong with that pairing.  My company had roast chicken, dressed properly for a fine restaurant and cooked to perfection.  We splurged on dessert, taking the renowned and monstrous coconut cream pie, and a delicious creme brulee. But, I also couldn't resist the fine selection of Quebec cheese on offer and had a trio of sumptuous morsels which I washed down with a tawny port.  The bill was epic to fit the meal. The staff were fun and we will certainly make a return visit when our bank account has sufficiently revovered."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly fast and attentive. The food was like nothing we have every tasted and so delicious. We got the filet mignon, and the lamb they were both divine. The filet mignon was so juicy and tender, it melted in your mouth. The potatoes that came with it were amazing, my favourite potatoes I probably every had. The lamb was cooked to perfection and loved the sauce it came in. We also got the chocolate moouse with apricot sorbets. The sorbet was delicious, very acidic and fresh."}
{"text":"I chose Scaramouche for my Valentine's Day celebration for two reasons. Firstly, one of my friends always raves about their coconut cream pie, and I wanted to see if it lived up to all that hype. And secondly, restaurant was running a $62 three-course Lobsterlicious special and I just can't seem to resist these prix fixe menus.   Three types of bread were served, and I had one of each. One small complaint was that the butter was really hard to spread onto the bread.  The bread basket was quickly followed by a complimentary amuse bouche: prosciutto with winter lettuce, toasted pine nuts, tarragon relish and Meyer lemon aioli. Everything tasted pretty good together, but it didn't wow me.  Here are my picks for the Lobsterlicious menu:  My choice of starter was the Dungeness crab ravioli with mustard greens, bok choy, radish and a uni butter sauce. The bok choy made the overall dish feel very Asian. The single raviolo was packed with crab meat, and the uni butter sauce was absolutely scrumptious. After demolishing everything else on the plate, I soaked up all the remaining sauce with bread.   For my main, I opted for lobster gnocchi. Oddly enough, I loved everything in my lobster gnocchi that was not lobster- the snap peas, carrots, pearl onions, beet, and herb gnocchi! The vegetables were bright and vibrant, and I especially enjoyed the sweet beets. On top of that, the gnocchi was absolutely lovely, as light as a pillow. I also thought that the presentation was stunning with all the colourful veggies.   My gnocchi was accompanied with a Parisienne lobster thermidor sauce, topped with toasted bread crumbs and gruyère cheese. On paper, this was everything that I should love- rich, cheesy lobster sauce topped with bread crumbs and cheese. Every spoonful contained large chunks of lobster meat. I couldn't believe that I could ever have too much lobster, but this was the case for me! Everything was so rich.  For desserts, I went with the Araguani chocolate mousse with earl grey ice cream, lemon curd, honey tangerines and blood orange reduction. Clearly, I don't know my chocolate well, because Araguani is a 72% cocoa dark chocolate bar made by Valrhona, one of best chocolatiers in the world. I think the \"mousse\" was a misnomer, because it was more like a dark chocolate bar filled with chocolate mousse. As expected, it was too dark for my liking, although the earl grey ice cream was amazing!  Here's what my bf ordered:  Lobster bisque to start. The soup was topped with armagnac cream and chives. For me, the soup was intensely rich, and the armagnac on top of that was overwhelming. I was slightly put off by so much alcohol in the soup.  8 oz filet mignon with porcini whipped potatoes, wild mushrooms, French green beans and Bordelaise sauce. I particularly loved the whipped potatoes, which packed an incredible punch of mushroom flavour. The steak was also executed very well.   For desserts, he ordered Scaramouche's famous coconut cream pie with white chocolate shavings and dark chocolate sauce. This was like heaven in a slice of pie! Even though it was impossibly decadent and rich, I just couldn't stop taking more and more bites! The white chocolate and coconut were such a great pairing, and the pie crust was perfectly flaky and delicate. Not great for the waistline, but it was so phenomenal that it was almost worth every calorie!  Who says you can't get full from fine dining? I was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal! It was definitely a memorable experience, but I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. After all, it was one of the most expensive meals that I've ever eaten, and I can't justify the price despite the generally positive experience. That said, I certainly wouldn't mind coming back for a slice of coconut cream pie! It was truly to die for!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good experience. We were running seriously late, but they still held our table, which was amazing. Our table ordered the filet mignon, which was one of the best anyone had eaten...ever! All of the fish ones were strictly above average ( sea bass, halibut). Service was great! You felt attended to. Biggest complaint- we had told them we had a birthday in our group, but no effort was made to put a candle in that persons dessert or make any other special attempt. Very disappointed in that. Also we requested a view, which we did not get. Understandable, given that we were late. Overall, above average food, good service and an overall fun experience."}
{"text":"This is the third time I came here, this time was different than other times, because it's a date. After traveling from uptown to downtown during the busy traffic hour, when you pull up in front of the restaurant, someone will run and open your door for you, that's service! We are seated near the window, I got all the view and my date is facing the trees so her view is only me or the tree. Anyways, we order two glass of wine, the foie gras, yes the foie gras never disappoint... I was definitely focus more on the foie gras than my date. The shrimp salad was surprisingly great,it has more shrimp than greens, it was light yet delicious. My entre was the tenderloin, so juicy so tender.  But my other focus here was there famous coconut cream pie, a to-die-for, nobody can make a creampie better than them. Irregardless of what happen after dinner, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My husband treated me to a date to Scaramouche for Valentine's Day. The view from our table was excellent. This has got to be the best food in Toronto. The chef's passion for cooking reflects in every dish.   I had the Foie Gras for my first course and my husband had a sampling of goat cheeses. I had filet mignon for my second course and my husband had the halibut. The halibut was a special that day so you won't see it on their menu. It was perfectly cooked, topped with lobster and it was definitely the best dish of the night.   We had the coconut pie for dessert and it was definitely big enough to share.   Definitely recommend this restaurant for your next special occasion. The food was delicious and very refined."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife and we were absolutely impressed! Food was in just the right proportion with different layers of flavors. Definitely a delight place."}
{"text":"For me, this is the best restaurant in Toronto. The ingredients are best of class. For example, rather than worrying about your choice of oysters, the chef simply offers one exceptional type. The vegetables that accompany the meat or fish are perfectly paired, not just added on. The waitstaff are very helpful when it comes to the extensive wine list. The price is high but the experience is worth it,"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come Scaramouche for Lobsterlicious and I finally got the chance this past Wednesday. During the month of February (Mon-Thurs. only) they run a three course prix menu for $62 show casing Lobster as the main. Finding the restaurant was a little tricky as it's attached to condo complex. Luckily valet was readily available on this snowy night and I didn't have to worry about finding parking.  Reservations are a definite must! I was surprised to see that midweek at 8pm on a snowy cold day the dining room was quite full. We weren't lucky enough to snag a window seat table however we had a clear view of floor to ceiling windows that run right around the back half of the restaurant.  Our waiter was very professional but down to earth at the same time. As I had work the next morning I passed on the alcoholic beverages and he was kind enough to bring over a menu selection of non-alcoholic cocktails. I chose the lemon spritzer which was very refreshing.  Next he went over the menus highlighting the lobsterlicious specials and then left us with a basket of assorted breads. It included a fruit/nut bread (my fav), sesame seed , and french bread. Like others we also had a hard time spreading the butter on the bread as it came straight out of the refrigerator.   After the bread came the Amuse Gueule which was smoked salmon in a cherry tomato with creme fresh. The smoked salmon had a really deep smokey flavour which I quite enjoyed and was balanced nicely by the creme fresh.  For appetizers  Pan Seared Sea Scallops - winter lettuces/blood oranges/lobster reduction Wow what a gorgeous looking dish! So colourful adorned with edible flower petals it was quite a feast for the eyes. The scallops were to die for! Cooked perfectly tender sweet meat and the lobster reduction was the perfect accompaniment to soak every morsel in!  My fiance chose the Lobster Bisque - chopped lobster/ armagnac cream Of course I got to steal a bite. It was really rich a creamy with mellow lobster flavour.  For mains we both went with the same dish  Lobster Tian - crushed fingerling potatoes/ butternut squash/kale/bacon/crispy shallots/smoked paprika buerre blanc Again another stunning presentation! I loved the combination of crushed potatoes paired with bacon and onions with sweetness from the squash and I was able to top every bite with a plump piece of lobster and dip it into the buerre blanc. I savored every spoonful! I loved every component of this dish!  For Desserts  I decided to upgrade to scaramouche's famous coconut cream pie for $5 extra to see if it really does live up to it's hype.  Coconut Cream Pie - white chocolate shavings / dark chocolate sauce Totally blows any other coconut cream pie out of the water! Luscious creamy decadent on a flaky pastry crust with the warm chocolate sauce. Ooo man was that good! Definitely lives up to it's hype!  I made my fiance choose the chocolate dessert from the prix fix menu (simply so I could indulge it two desserts)  Single Plantation \"Madirofolo\" Chocolate Ganache - brown butter ice cream/cocoa nib macarons/salted chocolate snow A total chocolate lover's fantasy! The ganache was silky and creamy with a deep chocolate flavour, loved \"snow\" and the cute little chocolate macarons. Another fantastic dessert!  Overall a spectacular meal from start to finish! From the beautiful views, courteous and professional service and the stunningly beautiful dishes that were equally delicious it was definitely a memorable dining experience!"}
