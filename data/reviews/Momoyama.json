{"text":"Fresh, Fast, Friendly  The food is great and always fresh. The service is fast. The staff is friendly. What's more is the prices are very reasonable and the place has been recently renovated. And you'll always get complementary crunchy soup, miso soup, fresh salad, and sometimes even a scoop of ice cream at the end.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service , decent food quality.  Reasonable price.   Highly recommend.   We ordered sashimi lunches.  They gave us free small soup noodle, soy bean and extra sashimi."}
{"text":"I usually don't use Yelp to write reviews (i am more of a reader) but the service that my friends and I just received from Momoyama was very disappointing, which has led me to write my very first review!  1. My friend ordered a 'special' unagi roll... (Very special indeed) ... Made it extra special by adding a strap of a plastic wrap underneath the unagi topping. (I wish I had a picture of it). A family member of mine also owns a restaurant and I am usually very understanding when it comes to such 'mistakes' that happen in the kitchen... But when we called the server to let him know of the plastic wrap, he looked at it without any apologies and just took the dish away to show it to the chef. It looked like the chef said something along the line of... \"Meh. not a big deal. Just a plastic wrap\". The server, (who looked like he was having the worst day of his life since we walked into the resto) just handed it back to us (plastic wrap removed) and told us that \"its not a big deal. It just got in there when we were rolling the roll\". And when I tried to tell him the consequences of accidentally swallowing a plastic strap that is approx 14cm long in length... He just looked at me and walked away without saying anything.  2. At the end when we asked for the bill, the server overcharged us by putting a more expensive dish for one of our dishes. Another unfortunate mistake.   I am giving ONE star for the freshness of their fish pieces. I had a bowl of Chrashi sushi - fish pieces were fresh and large in size. Rice portion was too small though.   I definitely won't be coming back to this restaurant in the future..... Bad Bad BAD experience."}
{"text":"This place was not like before.  So sad that chef Harry left! My husband and I were very loyal to this place until chef Harry left a few months ago. Before we were there almost every week. The portions were big and fresh whether you ordered sushi or sashimi. Tempura was really nice and light (just like Zen Japanese restaurant). We gave it a try a couple times after the chef left but we were disappointed everytime we went. Not just the quality and quantity have been changed, Tempura were greasy and dry. We are so lost now. Do not know where to go next time when we are craving for good quality of Japanese food with reasonable price. woowoo...."}
{"text":"Found this place by surprise. Had unique sounding rolls in the menu. Ordered the Legend Dragon Roll, Momo Yami Maki, and Spicy Samon. Originally thought prices were above average for location but was pleasantly surprised to receive complimentary edame, miso/ramen soup and salad with a non-ginger/orange dressing. The rolls were fantastic, not too much rice, presentation, quality and taste get a *thumbs up*."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in the City!  If you aren't going for All-You-Can-Eat, this is the place to eat! Great fresh quality, interesting rolls that are stuffed to the gills, and the service is friendly and remembers you. The food is absolutely fantastic! Most of my friends and family eat here and they find the food to be amazing! As well, You don't have to worry about getting a table, their hours are great and they are open late for a Thornhill restaurant!  Highly recommend Momo Yama for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I've shamefully not tried a majority of sushi places in Toronto, but I've been to enough that I can say Momoyama is great! When it comes to special occasions with the wife, Momoyama is our choice more times than not.  When we go, we'll order a 3-4 person mixed sashimi/sushi boat and always comes away very happy. Quality is great, service is great. The prices while not cheap, are reasonable for the quality you are getting.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not surprised to see another Korean run Japanese restaurant in this area. This one, however, is severely understaffed or was when I came in for dinner on Saturday. We sat there waiting for the menu for over 15 minutes, there were customers impatiently waiting for the bill and their food (there seems to be only one sushi chef behind the bar and one very stressed out waitress).  I ordered the Chirashi dinner ($17.95) - The presentation was nice but the sashimi pieces were dry. The rice were a bit overcooked and there was way too much radish to make the plate look fuller.   We also tried the Legend Dragon Roll ($14.95) and it was pretty good!  I really like the combo of soft shell crab, unagi and deep fries kani. I wished I tried out more specialty makis instead of my Chirashi but the sushi here is on the pricier side.   If the sashimi was fresh, I might come back.. But unfortunately the service did not impress either."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  Food portions are generous for the price.  Friendly service.  My favourite is the spicy salmon roll sushi, lots of salmon wrapped with a thin layer of rice.  The set lunch and dinners are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place is the bestttt!! Ever since I discovered this place by accident, I've been extremely surprised at the quality and freshness of their fish since. I have recommended many friends and brought many new people here and they all love it. They have a great lunch menu, dinner is a little pricier but well worth the money. Their best and one of the most memorable is the garlic butter fish sashimi.. This is a must try as the fish just MELTS in your mouth with delicious garlic flavor. It's like nothing I've ever tried before in terms of sashimi. Their rolls are amazing too.. They got a lobster tempura roll.... Hot lobster tempura in a roll..mmm Daaaaamnnn. The service is also ace. Korean waiters/waitresses are kind and efficient. Innovation, food, quality, and just that extra something special makes this place a 5 star A+ restaurant to me.  This is one of those hidden gems in Toronto waiting to be discovered by more."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm visiting Toronto from Boston I make it a point to get at least one meal here.  The sushi here is excellent, and they have a good selection of maki rolls as well.  The tempura is very light and tasty.  For a restaurant in a strip mall the prices aren't cheap, but  the quality is high and they've recently done a renovation.  They are very accomodating with replacing things for vegetarians.  Meals always come with a complimentary bowl of crunch soup, and the last couple of times for lunch they've also given us free edamame and an offer of free dessert.  The turnover of restaurants in this plaza (across from Centrepoint Mall) is high, but Momoyama has been a stable location for many years."}
{"text":"We misread the Yelp review and came in here really hungry expecting AYCE.  Apparently hunger makes me dyslexic.  We settled on the bento boxes (combination dinners with soup salad, bento box and dessert).  They're expensive at $19.95-$20.95 but the portions were larger than expected and the food quality pretty decent.  They only filled our tea cup when we first got there.  We ask for more tea after finishing our bento boxes and the waiter comes back holding the pot of tea in one hand and says, \"This is the last pot of tea,\" while patting the pot with his other hand before pouring the tea.  He then goes through the same routine with the table beside us.  We're absolutely bewildered.  It's only 10:15 and they're open until 11:00.  Whatever...maybe the city shut off their water since they couldn't pay the bills with only the four other small groups that we saw there that Friday night?  He comes around five minutes later with the bill and asks if it's ok if we pay first.  After paying, he still hasn't brought around the dessert so we ask him about it and get this answer: \"Well...normally we do provide dessert but we ran out.\"  But isn't it included in our meal?  It's included in the combination dinner.  \"Well actually it's not.\"  It's on the menu.  We paid for it.  He goes to the back and we hear him talking to someone else, presumably the owner.  Two minutes later, he comes back out with green tea ice cream.  Oh look at that, you didn't actually run out of dessert, did you?!  This restaurant certainly delivers a unique experience."}
{"text":"Amazing rolls and nabe udon. Phenomenal service that's not easily seen at a sushi restaurant. A-must-go place in Thornhill. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"one word. tempura.  The BEST i have had in a longgg time! I came here for lunch and had the salmon and tempura bento box.  It came with salad, soup, rice, and two california rolls.  The salmon portion is a bit small but it doesn't even matter because the tempura made up for it.  They give you ALOT and the batter was perfect :) My friend ordered bulgogi which was also good and also the chirashi portion is really big for lunch and super fresh."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and was greeted with live music which made it unbearably loud at first (not any fault of the restaurant - there was a private function that booked a corner of the restaurant that had hired a saxophonist). We were seated at the table promptly and given menus and table settings.   This is where I'll dock them a star, their service while good, was too prompt and fast. It felt almost as if they wanted to rush us out of the place.   They will however earn high marks on food. We were given the usual fare of miso soup which was too salty, and salad which was different from the typical green salad at Japanese restaurants. It had a strong peppery taste and I couldn't figure out what made the base of the dressing which was very tangy. Also as an accompaniment to these two appetizer dishes there was a warm noodle cup with crunchy tempura bits that was very tasty. As far as the main courses, I ordered a sashimi entrée and my girlfriend ordered a maki set. We got the sashimi entrée fairly quickly but had to wait significantly longer for the maki set, I'm not sure why. While we waited they brought us Edamame beans and kimchi(I assume the kimchi was to appease our wait). Several minutes later the maki arrived.   The presentation of the maki was very lack luster as the rolls were made poorly, not fully wrapped, weak structure and form. The reason they got high marks for their food was because it was really tasty. The maki were made with quality fresh ingredients. It was probably some of the best sashimi I've had in Toronto in a long time, all the cuts of sashimi were moderate in size, not the thinnest but not overly thick. They were soft and almost seemed to melt in my mouth.   After we finished with our food, the older lady came and cleaned the table while we were still sitting there (bad form old lady), which goes along with my earlier comment about the speed of their servers and the rush we felt.   Overall I would definitely go back here as a la carte places are more my thing than the usual ayce that people enjoy going to (usually not as high quality - quantity over quality - they mostly taste the same) which isn't the case here. Expect to spend $20+ per person pre-tip."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant at least 10 times in the last few years.  Everyone has raved about it in their reviews, but I've had 2-3 bad experiences here.   One time the chicken terriyaki was clearly undercooked with blood coming out of it - clearly not edible.  When we sent it back, the waitress told us that the chef said it was fine to eat and that the \"chicken had large veins.\"  On another occasion, I was alone, and was served by an inexperienced waitress.  Usually everyone gets a complimentary crunchy noodle soup and sometimes ice cream.  I got neither - even though I saw all other tables getting these two complimentary items, and almost felt unwelcome.  I can understand if a restaurant is packed, I'd go somewhere else or I'd eat faster, because I know the restaurant industry is tough.  But this restaurant is never packed.    On a good day, this restaurant is 4 stars, but based on these experiences, I will not go back.  I'd rather go to Seoul House (in the adjacent plaza), which is almost as good, cheaper, and more consistent.  If you choose to come here, I think the lunch bento boxes are better than the sushi."}
{"text":"I only came here twice for lunch and ordered the surpreme bento box both times which includes salad, chicken teriyaki, tempura, rice, miso soup & like 6-8 proper slices of sashimi. I have to say, that it is the best bento box I've ever had so far; it is kind of expensive at $20 but the portion is quite big. the sushi is pretty fresh. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"There is a lot of restaurants to choose from in this plaza, read some great reviews and decided to try it... Was not impressed.  Prices: the bento boxes were upwards of $20 each, the specialty rolls were $12 and up and was nothing special when it came. I've had a better spider roll from an ayce than here, I could not see the soft shell crab or taste it for that matter.   The bento box has rice, salad, Kalbi, tempura, and 6pcs of sushi. The salad is very sour, with maybe 3 pcs of lettuce, the tempura has some weird combinations, fried onion, beans etc, the yam was under cooked, but the pumpkin was perfectly cooked and not too oily. The sushi was nice and soft with a good amount of rice, but it's not like it's the freshest or the best I have had. I'm so used to the awesome bento boxes at akane that I feel ripped off by the prices here.   The service is nothing special, never came once to refill my tea, which I completely finished, was so quick to come and clear our plates and hand over the bill, did not give the ice cream until we asked for it, it was included in the bento box! And it's the smallest half scoop ever."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some pretty terrific lunch combos that are plentiful and tasty! I had the beef and tempura bento box. I was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of vegetable tempura. The onion one was gigantic and very enjoyable! Beef was cooked to my liking and service was good, considering it was quite busy. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is mediocre. I expected the rolls to be tasty but they were so bland and I've had much fresher sashimi at AYCE restaurants which is just sad. The starters were great and complimentary. But truly I'd never return here it just didn't cut it for me. I hope they can turn things around."}
{"text":"This place is a clear example of \"Don't Judge a Book By it's Cover\". I was skeptical about this place  because of the exterior, but as soon as I stepped in, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and the high quality of service provided when we arrived there.  It was cool and that was great because it was a hot day when we went. We ordered and right off the bat we were given complimentary food with our order so we definitely did not go hungry. I'm not saying that you are ensured complimentary food there. But it is something I experienced as well and as a foodie I love the idea of it because it causes me to eat new things that are brought before me.  Over all we got:  2 Miso Soups 2 Noodle Soups 1 Seaweed Salad 1 Order of the Vegetarian Gyoza Dumplings 2 California Rolls 1 Salmon Roll 1 Salad 1 Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box 2 Sodas 2 Scoops of Ice Cream  All for around $40 (Not including Tax and Tip)  For what it was worth the food was really good (even without the free stuff). It was actually so much that I had a full lunch for work the next day. Our waitress was phenomenal and was able to make sure our food was done and served correctly and took care of any questions we had while we were there.  This is definitely a place I will look forward to going to in the future to try the different foods they have on their menu."}
{"text":"The best sushi place on Steeles. I've been there twice and both times have been awesome. We got so much complimentary stuff. Soup, salad, spring rolls, and ice cream.   It may be a bit more expensive than some places, but with all the freebies, it balances out. Great quality fish as well."}
{"text":"I originally bought family here for the special lunches but we ended up getting three special rolls and a tempura order to share.   The rolls were very well done, nice presentation and generous use of fresh ingredients. You can definitely tell the difference from AYCE rolls.   The tempura were very nicely battered and fried. I really loved the string beans and broccoli tempura but wished there were more shrimp ones (there were only two and my little brother devoured both) :/  The service was pretty awesome as well. We were promptly sat, brought tea and complimentary soup and salad (great quality freebies!), and were given a great recommendation when asked. The owner looking lady also came by to refill our tea and had the friendliest smile I have seen during a tea refill!   I wouldn't say this place is the cheapest but we didn't go away feeling ripped off either so I guess it's a fair trade. Will come back to try lunch special again!"}
{"text":"I been eyeing Momoyama for the longest time. It looks really traditional outside, when I walked in, I was so pleasantly surprise. The inside is nicely decorated, modern and minimalistic, with a nice hue of green..  Lunch Specials here is till 4:00 PM, great to drop by for a late lunch or as an afternoon tea.  Sushi B ($9.95) - Tempura bits/noodles Soup and Salad which has really light dressing were A-OK - The fish here are fresh and better quality and variety compare to a lot of other restaurants I been to at this price point - The Shari rice was nicely vinegared, round, firm and has a great bite - California rolls oh with a nice balance of cucumber and avocado.. perfectly rolled into large bite size!  Services here is fast and friendly... Korean sushi chefs and wait staffs are all really friendly.  Lunch specials does have a wide variety of bento boxes and combos with cooked food. There are also great selections of maki.   I think I would definitely be back to try out some other items in the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was a mixed bag. We got one of the smaller sushi boats to share. The salmon and butterfish sushi were good, and so was the california roll. On the other hand, the tuna was chewy and not fresh. I also didn't like that they put in those cheapy sushi that no one likes such as the very-thin-piece-of-shrimp sushi and squid sushi. I did like that they included salad, miso soup, and some noodle soup. The miso soup had an interesting, thick flavour that was pretty different from most miso soups I've had and the noodle soup was nice as well. The salad wasn't great but it was edible. The interior is pretty nice, and the servers were quick and friendly."}
