We ordered Mongolian beef and pad Thai for take out.
This was the worst Chinese food we have ever experienced.
The meat was a slimy mass of tough covered with overlooked onions and day old brown sauce. 
The pad Thai was mooshy, noodle fall apart and no meat.
We ate 2 bites and couldn't take anymore
So bad our dog turned up his nose and gave us a look like what the hell!"}
{"text":"We went there based on reviews we read, and it was all that, and more. There were so many choices, so it took us a while to decide. I had the hot and sour soup and the General Tso's chicken. My date had the sweet and sour chicken. It was all delicious. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We are frequent customers, as everything we've ever gotten has been just wonderful! Such fast delivery too!"}
{"text":"Pan Asia is fast and they have great customer service. Never disappointed with the food. Way better than Panda Express. We'd recommend the sesame chicken and the vegetable lo mein."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for my traditional birthday lunch. The owner greeted my husband and i and immediately showed us to a table. Sadly because of all the recent rain there was an odor that really made you want to turn around and just leave. We decided to give it a chance, my husband ordered general taos chicken and i had my fav sweet and sour combo with fried rice. The food was excellent as usual, the owner made sure our table service was great.overall good food, just an odor of a damp building making you want to leave. Next time it's a take out order but definitely will eat the good food from here again"}
{"text":"The combonation fried rice and combination lo mein were great.  Seasoned very well. The veggies were well sauteed.  Lot of meat in both dishes. I originally wanted General Tso Chicken but it came with white rice."}
{"text":"We have got takeout and eaten in this restaurant! Such a diamond in the rough! Fantastic food, service & sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Stopped here for dinner while traveling for work. Had the vegetable teriyaki and a spicy tuna roll. Service was very fast, so I'd recommend it if you want decent Chinese/Japanese in a hurry."}
{"text":"We actually live just around the corner from here but we never tried it.  One day some friends invited me to go and i t was very quiet and relaxing.  

I must say that everyone(party of 9) seemed to really enjoy their meals.  We all shared edamame for an appetizer.  Some others had the soup, too. No one had any complaints there either...  Personally, I got the Kung Pao Shrimp (extra spicy, please) and it was superb.  Sometimes shrimp tends to get overcooked in stir-fry dishes but this was very tender and flavorful.  There was plenty left to take home and I had a delish lunch the next day.  Also I tried my friend's sushi (can't tell you what is was as I'm not familiar with different types) but it was tasty.   She said she usually gets the sushi there and it's always good.

 Also, the dishes had wonderful eye appeal... rose garnishes made of carrots and that sort of thing. 

The service was very friendly and timely, too.  I'd highly recommend trying this place.  It was a real treat."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I added photos.

I came here because the reviews were okay, and it was the closest place with sushi. However, after ordering from here, I wish I would have stayed away. 

It was lunch time, so I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki with California Rolls luncheon special for takeout. Also, I judge a place by how their prepare their Spicy Salmon Maki, so I ordered that as well.

The main lunch was terrible. The chicken was flavorless, despite being drenched by this watery soy sauce that was passed off as Teriyaki. Also the chicken wasn't cut up into pieces like it's supposed to be on a grill; it looked like it belonged on a McDonald's bun for their grilled chicken. I threw most of it out. 

The California roll was actually worse. There was way too much cucumber, it was maybe 60% cucumber. In fact, it was falling apart because of all the cucumber loosely packed. Then you had about 35% avocado. The final 5% was the fake crab, which is the smallest fake crab I've ever seen. It literally was the size of a thumbnail--SHAMEFUL!

Now on to what I was excited for, the Spicy Salmon. Um, what is this mayonaise goo plopped on top? Spicy it was not, and neither was it fresh. This was filled with even more cucumber, but at least I could see the salmon without a microscope. I ended up scraping off the mayo concoction, only to realize that this sushi tasted and looked worse than those pre-boxed sushi rolls that you can find at the grocery store.

I can't believe I paid $12 for this crappy meal. I want a refund."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place to go.  Their chicken is amazing.  They put just the right amount of breading on the outside and cook it to a light crisp.  Sometimes I wonder what other Chinese places are selling, cause it sure doesn't seem like chicken to me.  Not Pan Asia - there is real chicken breast in the middle,.  Their non breaded chicken (ex hunan chicken) was head and shoulders above similar dishes around the area.  I have not personally tried the sushi, but I have heard good things.  Don't discount their non sushi food like one of the other reviews say."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that's so bad you tell tales about how bad it is later.  The food was just absolutely terrible and nowhere near worth the money we paid for it.  The decor is dated and dingy.  I would never return.  (note:  we did not eat the sushi; we ordered off the menu of chinese dinners)"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this place. They have all there rewards posted up on the outside but the inside is dated and service was horrible. We walked and were greeted by the hosted/waitress. She's a multi tasked that's for sure. I looked like there were only 2 other people working. Granted the place wasn't that busy. Red flag there. To start Bryan ordered sushi. Not sure what but he really liked it. I ordered moo shu pork and shared with the little man. The plum sauce was very good. I don't like really sweet plum sauce and this was just perfect. However I do wish the vegtables were cooked just a bit more. Now the service. I ordered water which I always I didn't get a straw and we also had to ask for another set of silverware. My son had a lemonade and I put it at the end if the table along with my empty water glass and waited about 15 for a refil. That is such a big pet peve of mine when eating out. I hate when empty glasses just sit there untouched. So over all the food was pretty good but the service was pretty bad. This place seems like it might be past it's prime."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a week for lunch.  Japanese food is excellent.  The Salmon lunch box is outstanding.  Comes with Miso soup, salad, and California rolls.  I also get two pieces of yellow tail.  Fish is always fresh.  The owner is there for lunch and dinner 7 days a week.  He is dedicated to customer satisfaction and is always helpful when placing orders.  This place is the most underrated restaurant in the South Hills!!  I have not had a bad meal here in 3 years."}
{"text":"There's a good chance you might pass by Pan Asia and never go in. Everytime I have driven past here, it always looks closed. Fear not, they are still alive and kicking despite the lack of customers. Hubs and I stopped by on a recent Saturday night to give it a shot. We were one of three tables. A woman was also picking up a to go order. And, I overheard our server mention to the table next to us that they deliver. I decided on the three cup chicken. Hubs went with the sushi. Despite decent reviews for sushi, I couldn't bring myself to try it. Within a very short amount of time, our entrees were served. Just looking at hubs' sushi I could tell that it wasn't the freshest fish. After tasting it, he agreed. Nowhere near as good as our south hills staple, Little Tokyo, which could explain the lack of a crowd. My chinese dish was served in a sizzling hot pot. Chicken, veggies and three different sauces combined hence the name, three cup chicken. I was really hoping for a little spice and some great flavors, that's why I ordered the three cup. Three sauces has to be better than one. Eh, not really. It was generally just OK. No real spice. No really distinct flavors except for soy sauce. The chicken was fine. The string beans and peppers were tasty. But, I decided to not take the left overs home. Overall, Pan Asia did not impress me. Because we have many other chinese/japanese options close by that are on the same level or better, we probably won't head back to Pan Asia."}
{"text":"Whoa. A Chinese restaurant. On Rt 51. That serves sushi. WHY on earth did I even give this place a shot? Somehow my moment of insanity paid off, because the sushi here was really, really good.

Gyoza, mediocre, but the two maki I got were so shockingly excellent. I had the Crazy Eel (crunchy spicy tuna topped with bbq eel and tobiko), which was tasty, and the signature Pan Asia (salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with tobiko), which had maybe the largest cuts of fish EVER. I swear there was like a whole salmon in there. Totally worth the $14 that I initially rolled my eyes at.

Now that I'm working in West Mifflin and it's more difficult for me to get out to Sushi Tomo in the North Hills, I can definitely see this being my sushi staple in Pittsburgh. Next time I get Chinese, I might have to give Pan Asia a try, too."}
{"text":"Stick to the sushi, which is very good for the area. The Alaska roll(salmon, avocado, cucumber) was six pieces for about five dollars Went on a Monday afternoon just in time for lunch, and the menu was very well priced and the lunch portions are good(they won't stuff you, but it's enough). The chinese food, however, was lacking. The ma-po tofu was essentially tofu, a frozen pea-carrot mix, and some mushrooms in a not-so-sweet general tso's sauce. I'm not sure if I was served the wrong dish, but by my and the rest of the world's definition it was not ma po tofu. The amazing chicken my brother got was just an orange chicken, the sauce looked over-reduced and very sticky(like caramel).

I would easily come back for the sushi, which is probably the best in the south hills, and I think the prices are good."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are never many people eating here because I have always had great meals!  Try it out, I think you'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"Along the strip of junk that is Route 51, among the strip malls and bad chain restaurants and worse non-chain restaurants, is this hidden gem.

Actually, it's tough to miss.  It's large, with a huge parking lot and lots of neon.  It just doesn't look like it would be all that good.

But you would be oh so wrong to think that.  You enter this odd 50s-look building to see a gleaming, well-maintained interior that's quite at odds with your initial impression.  The classy, attractive menu heightens your sense of anticipation.

The menu is unconventional, with several unusual dishes I had never seen before.  Prices were somewhat higher than normal, but considering the larger portion size, well in line with P F Chang's and other competitors.  

I had a sampler with their General Tso's chicken, Lemon Chicken and white-sauce chicken (the exact name of which slips my mind).  The various flavours were excellent, and complimented each other well, particularly the General Tso's.

Their Two Cup Chicken was also top grade, with first-rate ingredients prepared exceptionally well.

Egg rolls were easily the best I've had in the city, with a crispy shell and quality ingredients inside.

The dining experience was likewise excellent.  They had unobtrusive but friendly service, but the people were friendly when I wanted to talk.

It's a distinct pleasure to review a Pittsburgh restaurant I actually like.  This is easily the best dining experience I've had in over a year of living in this town full of awful restaurants.  It gains my highest recommedation - which is tough to get.

[Update: I occasionally visit Pittsburgh from my home in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I can report that as of November 2011, the food is still first-rate.  The beef portion of the \"Black and White\" dish is the best I've had, anywhere, with a perfect amount of spiciness.  So far everything I've had on the menu has been delicious.  This place continues to earn my highest recommendation.]"}
{"text":"We love the quick service and delivery. My kids love their food. You know what to expect. Dependable for a good meal."}
{"text":"My parents finally came through, albeit belatedly, with my birthday dinner (there was too much going on during the past few weekends for the family to get together) tonight. I had been wanting to try Pan Asia for some time as its been around for quite a while, but Sis was still under the weather...so we got take-out. 

Yes, Japanese take-out. I even had sushi. I didn't even know that was possible, let alone gastronomically correct, but hey, they offer Chinese also, so it can't be that much of a sin. 

We had ourselves a feast of feasts, so a list is in order: Shrimp Egg Rolls, Fried Pork Dumplings, Beef Skewers, Beef Fried Rice, Chilean Sea Bass (for Dad), Singapore Mee Fun (for Mum), Sesame Chicken (for Sis), Gyoza, Volcano Roll (I think there were 6 total), and Seafood Yaki Udon. By the way, the last 3 were my picks, but we all sampled and shared, like family should. 

\"What you doing?\" My family were perplexed at my picture-taking. 

\"Yelp, guys. Yelp!\" My mother's eyes rolled, my father groaned, my sister laughed. 

Mom asks, \"That isn't why you wanted take-out from Pan Asia for your birthday, is it?\" 

\"Ummm...\"

\"He reviews EVERYTHING on that goofy site,\" Dad adds, shaking his head. 

Not all of what we ordered was dynamite, but nothing was inedible. The gyoza (seafood dumplings according to the menu) were tasty enough but were also lacking in culinary character or distinctiveness (just what was the 'seafood' anyway?), and the Beef Skewers were somewhat dry, but that's where my very minor criticism ends. Everything else, from usual Chinese fare like the Sesame Chicken, the Beef Fried Rice, and the Pork Dumplings to less-traveled (for me at least) Japanese offerings like the Seafood Yaki Udon won the evening. The Yaki Udon noodles were as bulky as bullrope yet soft as butter and were utterly crowded by shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, and a colorful array of fresh vegetables. The sushi rolls were tremendous and along with all else we brought home, held up well. Sushi has been getting a backlash like cupcakes currently are; they're trendy, flashy, but damn it, sushi's pretty damn toothsome, not to mention filling. The Volcano Rolls had salmon, avocado, a burningly arcane \"hot\" sauce, and capelin roe (masago) all wrapped up in a rich, heavy wad of supple white rice. 

I don't know if any of this is authentic. I don't care if any of it's authentic. It was just stomach-stuffing excellence. 

And while were on this tack, take my father's Chilean Sea Bass. An alchemistic,  nectarous sauce as sytgian as demon's blood coats a swollen filet of that which rivals lobster, the fearsome looking Patagonian toothfish, and with your first luscious, fall-apart bite, you have found Zion. I was envious of my father, but alas, there was too much for him to eat alone and too much else for him to try, so barter we all did, just so we could try what appears to be Pan Asia's optimum dish. Every one of Pan Asia's detractors need to try this dish. 

As far was the remainder goes, the pork dumplings were yet another great example of that staple of appetizers, the Sesame Chicken was triumphantly tender and candied, the beef fried rice was quite tasty with its generous chunks of meat and ideal rice, and Dear Mother's Singapore Mee Fun was a titillatingly tangled mess of Oriental goodness. So, out of 10 dishes, there were 8 winners, and 2 also-rans that were not at all dreadful. How could I not give them a 5?

Going back to the take-out aspect, each menu item we ordered was packed expertly, all of it fitting tidily in a box and arriving at the correct temperature. I often take this part of dining experiences for granted but will no more. 

If Pan Asia's take-out was of this high quality, eating in must be extraordinary. That can only mean one thing: Chef Wen Chun Yu is a true champion of the kitchen and deserves your dollars. This area is no wasteland. Ignore anyone who tells you differently. If and when I visit the restaurant, I shall shake Mr. Yu's hand and thank him personally for the grand smorgasbord he made for my family and I."}
{"text":"I actually have not been there since they got rid of the buffet several years ago.
I wish they would bring it back.  The place used to be hopping in the good old days.  Sit down order off the menu is too risky that it is not something you like
At least with a buffet you see what you are getting."}
{"text":"About the best asian food I've had in the area with nice service. The personable owner is a renowned chef and this is evident from the quality imagination of the food. This place frequently wins awards in local newspaper surveys.

The Chinese is lighter and much healthier than the mystery food at the all-you-can eat places. The General Tso's is very good and the portions are generous. Rarely busy, this place is a nice place to relax and enjoy your meal.

They have Japanese and Sushi with many specialty rolls and often things like live sea urchin. They also have udon soup bowls which are very filling for $12.

The bento boxes for lunch and dinner include an entree, soup, salad, rice, california rolls, etc. for a reasonable fixed price. They also have some nice dinner for two options (about $33 total) which can be either sushi or chinese food and is a nice way of enjoying sushi without  paying through the nose for it.

All-in-all, a very nice place."}
{"text":"Not a fan. the place is kinda dingy and the food is average asian at best. However you do pay a premium price. If you are looking for a special night out with someone this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Never had anything I didn't love. The crab Rangoon and steamed pork dumplings are sooo good better than any other place I've ever been. We go here all the time. I've introduced so many people to it and everyone loves it. The sushi is so fresh!!! Friendly wait staff. Highly recommended!!"}
