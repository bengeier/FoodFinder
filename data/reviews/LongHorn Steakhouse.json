{"text":"Longhorn has great food but I do think they are a little pricey!! Seems like their prices keep going up but I enjoy the food and atmosphere and the people are generally friendly!"}
{"text":"We came here for a full dinner but left after our drinks so this review does not grade the steak but the lackluster service. 

From the moment you walk in, you are (or should be) tempted to leave. The \"hostess\" doesn't smile or greet you, but hastily takes you to a table. Then the waitress comes with the same attitude and lack of knowledge of the food, wine or beer. She couldn't answer even what beers they had or what was different about them. After saying we were ready to place our order she disappeared. After a long duration she returned, at which time we decided we had enough. 

I may give Longhorn another try, but not at this location."}
{"text":"Ill give two stars but ONLY, because our server was awesome. Other than that save yourself at least $20 and go across the street to the Texas Roadhouse.
It was a Saturday night, so we did have to wait, but I would say it wasnt any longer than 10 minutes.  the staff was nice, and friendly, and as I stated before our server was great!
The food however was not we ordered the Parmesan Crusted Asparagus for an appetizer which was ok but lacked any real flavor. My boyfriend got a a 6 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes a chopped salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms and grilled shrimp. I opted for the Napa Chicken with the corkscrew mac n cheese w/bacon. 
The highlight of our meal had to be the shrimp. It was cooked perfectly, and who can go wrong with lemon and melted butter.  The rest was just not very good, the steak was overcooked, and the sauteed mushrooms were not fresh, they were undoubtly from a can
The chicken was cooked well but definitely needed salt, and pepper. The chicken came topped with artichoke hearts roasted tomatos and Portobello mushrooms. The tomato and mushroom were fresh, but the artichokes were pickled and it threw the taste of the dish off. The mashed potaotes and mac and cheese were the same as the asparagus and were mediocre at best, and the salad, well it was definitely from a bag and I wouldn't be surprised if the dressing was as well. 
After tip the bill was close to $70. Not worth it by a long shot. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had the best service! The food was amazing! Wings was just perfect. We both had the outlaw stake mmmmm the prices were a bit high but all in all we loved everything we orderd which was a lot! The key lime pie is soo yummy!"}
{"text":"Bad experience at Rocky River Longhorn.  Ordered a salmon salad to go and was told it would be 20 minutes.  I thought that was a bit long for a salad, but decided to do it.  I got there 20 minutes later, waited in a long line at the hostess stand, to be told to go to the bar area.  I went to the bar...no one was there to help.  After about 10 minutes someone asked what I needed.  I told them about my salad that I had ordered now 30 minutes ago.  They went to check on it..I then had to wait another 20 minutes to get it!  When I got it home, the salmon was tough on the edges like it was either freezer-burned or cooked too long.  I just hope I don't get sick from it!  This location needs better quality control and time management!"}
{"text":"First time here and honestly get the Porterhouse for 2 with their homemade sauce. Best steak I've ever had, better than Mannys...that night anyway.  Loaded mashed potatoes were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Week night dinner date! Great service during our visit. I ordered the Napa Chicken. My guest ordered the filet with shrimp. The chicken is made in a creamy sauce with artichoke and tomatoes. It comes with a side and a salad. Plenty of food. Warm bread arrives at the table when you are seated."}
{"text":"My wife I love coming here.  The service is amazing,  the food is great, we have zero complaints.  We always try to get the same waitress and we usually do.  Her name is Christina and she is by far the best.  Our drinks never get low, she is very friendly and always takes care of us.  The manager chad is also very friendly and attentive he always comes and talks to us every time were here.  We feel like family here as good as they treat us.  I strongly recommend that you eat here you want be disappointed."}
{"text":"04/11/2016 3:30ish. Copperfield Blvd, Concord, NC.   I love Longhorn Steakhouse.  Today made me think I'll find another location.  My mother is 87 yrs old.  Blind.  Wheelchair bound.  It's a treat when she goes to a restaurant, and I treated her to her favorite jalapeno poppers and wild west shrimp today.  The appetizers were delish, as usual.  And the waitress (Kiara, Kiana?) was attentive and polite.  I tipped her $5 for a $16 tab.  No complaints whatsoever about the appetizers or wait staff.  Tops!

My mother and I are leaving.  Two women are chatting it up at the hostess station.  The restaurant isn't busy.  No one waiting.  The doors are not handicapped friendly, so I'm trying to hold the doors open (two), and push the wheelchair through without the door hitting my mother.  These women continue their chat as if we were not even there, muchless struggling with the doors.  I pushed my mother outside and returned to remind them that there will be a day when they, too, are old and in need of assistance, and that they should be ashamed of themselves.  I can't tell you what they were talking about that was more important than an elderly customer because they were speaking spanish, but I can tell you that my mother and I will find another place the next time we venture out from 'the home' for a treat.  Shame on Longhorn Steakhouse for employing such inconsiderate, uncaring, inattentive hostesses.  Last visit for us. .. and we've been going there since 2005. Shameful.

P.S.  Please install automatic doors to accommodate handicapped people because your hostess(es) is/are too busy babbling with one another to help an 87 yr old, wheelchair bound lady and her daughter.  You folks will be old and incapacitated one day, too.  Shameful.

I posted a 5 star review of this restaurant in 2013.  The quality of the food has not wavered, but the quality of the service staff has greatly declined.  Maybe they are just too young and dumb, or don't speak english well enough to understand that courtesy is part of the job! You don't let your customers struggle while you stand babbling with your buddy.  I am completely Disgusted. You won't see us again."}
{"text":"My fiance had decided to take me here for fathers day and I was a little doubtful at first because I feel too many places mess up a good steak. We were started off with a few pieces of bread with butter, it was good, nothing to go crazy about but a good start. Even though it was Father's Day and completely jam packed, our food did not take long to arrive. I ordered a plate with a filet and lobster tail. The filet was absolutley amazing, tender, juicy, cooked so perfectly! The lobster tail on the other hand may as well have been a crawdad tail beacuse it was so small with no meat in it. Our server was a pretty cool guy, can't remember his name but he didn't rush us nor push too hard to make it obvious he wants tips lol I will be back when  I have steak money!"}
{"text":"Passed by their many different locations and never stopped in.  We finally gave it a try today, had a steak and a side of mac & cheese.  Was just blah, steak was undercooked,mac & cheese must of used water from the Dead Sea to boil it in.  Doubt that we will give it another shot but prices where reasonable."}
{"text":"We like eating here . The prime rib is awsome along with many other items.  Nice relaxing and a great staff.  ."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my mother. It's beautiful inside! The server gave excellent service.  The food was fresh and full of flavor! Yum!! I will come back soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"First timer, lunch with two friends. Server was friendly. My steak was sent back three times as it was too pink. Not once was I made to feel like that was a hassle or inconvenience. Was snacking on Firecracker Chicken app which got free from joining their Club on my phone. My NEWFAVE awesome app!!!! Steak was good. Nice female manager insisted I take home dessert for the inconvenience. So she bagged up a massive dessert which I will try tonight. Impeccable customer service. You just don't get that these days. Will be back for sure. Thanks for a great visit."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday lunch based on reports that they had a good lunch menu.  When we got there we discovered that you can only order from their dinner menu Sundays. The good news is that the staff is very friendly. Otherwise, the meal was a disaster.  The food came out faster than an automatic rifle. The t'onions consisted of a flavorless, cloche coating with a very tiny piece of onion. The salad was way over dressed. The sirloin was so heavily seasoned with a spicy coating that after three bites we couldn't eat anymore. it was better suited for a fajita!  The baked potato was delicious however. Thanks to the manager for taking care of the meal for us but it didn't change the experience. Hope they can manage the kitchen a little better.   We came because we wanted to go to somewhere different-  I guess that's what we got!"}
{"text":"Quality steaks and appetizers. I've never tried anything else so I can't say if it's good or not. If I. Going to a place with the word \"steak house\" in it then I would recommend trying a steak. Good place."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went there as part of my birthday celebration. It was our first time and the LAST time we will ever go there. First of all we went to the bar to order cocktails received the worst service ever. We had to wait forever because the server was busy talking. When she came she was not friendly at all.  The area at the  bar we were sitting at needed to be cleaned off. When she came she took the dishware and utensils. Took our order  but didn't wipe the area off and left two used  straws there. So we WAITED on our cocktails. Finally when we got our drinks I asked if she would wipe the area off because there was a sticky substance on it. The server gave me a funny look and said sure.  So she gave us our drinks but didn't give us napkins. Which you usually get when you order comes you get napkins. But we didn't. So I got the  server's attention and asked if she could bring us napkins. When I asked for the napkins I got the impression that I was agitating  the server based upon  the look and tone that I received from her. So as we waited for the napkins our buzzer went off. It took so long for us to get the napkins that the seater came looking for us. So I left and my friend stayed to  pay our tab. Which it took her forever to do. While she was there she the server gave her an attitude because she asked for her change back and then goes on to say how much our tab was because she  assumed that just because we got our cocktails that she was getting a tip. So when she brings  the change she  throws it down in my friends hand. Now, I don't know about anyone else but to me you don't get a tip for doing your job. You get a tip based upon the level of customer service you provide. And if you are deserving you will at least get the minimum. And if it's good I will tip extra.  And if you are rude you will get 0. So when we finally our table we asked to see the manager because that tip issue was the last straw. Management made it seem like she was sooooo sorry and that she  was gonna  take care of us when we got our bill. Needless to say nothing was taken off. But I  wasn't suprised. The service from our table server  was excellent and I tipped him based around the  level of  customer service I received so it was extra.   
Clearly there is an issue with the bar service because I read a previous review regarding the bar servers. I will not go back to dine there."}
{"text":"(9:00 pm) They were out of prime rib, so I settled for rib eye steak (12oz). First one was tough, so  the waiter brought another. It was not much better. 
Asparagus was steamed and small stalks. They were good, but needed something to boost the flavor.
Waiter was good and worth the tip.
Suggestion: Prime Rib order early evening, Rib eye, don't order. It's a crap shoot at longhorn steak. Asparagus if you like it. Also, order it early evening, they run out of lemon sauce for it.
Longhorn is now trying to compete with Outback for the worst steaks."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a while but our experience was very good. Both food and service.  Our server Kati was excellent. We had to be at the movie in an hour.  She took care of us .  We had the steakhouse burger and Flat iron steak cooked perfectly and very flavorful too."}
{"text":"Poor service. got the bill wrong twice and made us wait forever. The food is also mediocre."}
{"text":"Visiting Surprise AZ, we saw this place and wanted to try it out. Though there are none in Ca at the time we visited, I already knew it would be a little bit pricey but for good reason. Their steaks were of superior quality along with a custom made sauce for each steak. To me this was certainly worth it and the portions were big. It is a treat to go there."}
{"text":"Not impressed...my wife always wants to go to longhorn and I can think of two better steak places but I am open to trying something again. Called ahead and still waited 20 mins before sitting at the bar. Waited an hour for an overcooked steak and canned mushrooms. After we left my wife told me her steak was horrible. What a waste of a cow...respect the beef and go to roadhouse"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. I ordered the lamb chops and was very pleased with how good they tasted, although I wish they had bigger servings. Also wish they offered a rack of lamb on their menu. Highly likely to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Very good service, every time we come here., if something isn't ok with the food they are more than happy to fix the problem .. Always plenty of refills on drinks.. We had a real sweet waitress a Crystal Barr, she even boxed up my sons food for us, instead of like some places they just drop you off the boxes and go about their business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that we were not informed that our gift card did not include alcohol when we checked in at first and asked specifically if our card was legitimate. We won't be back even though your food and beer/wine was fine. Just another steak place."}
{"text":"We had been waiting and wondering just how the dining experience was here. We went in on a Wednesday at 4:15 PM......and even though there were MANY empty tables we were told our wait would be 10 minutes. Our wait time turned into an hour...not 10 minutes I ordered sirloin steak and my wife ordered a baked potato, along with French onion soup. My choice came with a side salad and I optioned for the French onion soup also.
     Our orders arrived in decent time....but my wife's baked potato was cold, although her soup was very hot. My soup was hot as well....but my salad was very mediocre at best. My piece of steak looked good when it arrived.....but wreaked of salt upon tasting! I could not even finish the meat because of the taste. To top things off......the bill came to just shy of $40......and we had no alcoholic drinks....just ice tea and Coke. No desserts either!
     Needless to say, we won't be going back.....and I don't really think this restaurant will be around long, because there are too many GOOD places to eat in Surprise....and all very easy to get to!"}
{"text":"My friend & I have been here often the last three years. We have had a good experience. My favorite is the Outlaw Ribeye medium~well, baked potato, salad w/house Italian.
Sometimes we split this 18oz Ribeye and order extra side dishes. Service has met our expectations, a couple servers were more on top of timing visits to our table, which is appreciated.  Looking forward to returning tomorrow for my birthday.  
Highly recommend, suggest you visit late lunch/early dinner if you don't wish to wait for a table. Always enjoy our visits to the Rocky River Longhorn Restaurant."}
{"text":"After waiting 10 minutes we finally got served our water. 10 more minutes after just taking our order I finally got served the kids drink. the other tables being serviced by another server had drinks bread and refills by this time. the asshole server scoffed and said \" wait a minute\" when I asked if we could have bread. I immediately got up and left after telling the other server why I was leaving. I'll never return to this location!!!!! What an asshole!"}
{"text":"Well, the logical place to begin would be with the moment I entered the door. We were a party of 8, two of which are 8+ month pregnant ladies, with no reservation at about 5pm on a Saturday night. We were estimated a 45min wait, which seemed reasonable based on the time and crowd present.

45min had passed and soon turned to an hour as we saw another party our size who arrived after us being seated. After complaining two times we were seated after just shy of 2 hours! Needless to say we were all quite frustrated already.

The waitress then brought us our bread and a stack of plates, half of which were dirty with a red substance dried on the rim. When we requested she bring clean ones she laughed and said she did not see anything. After assuring her that we were indeed serious she obliged.

We then ordered and to top of the perfect (I use the word perfect extremely loosely here) dinner night I was brought the wrong type of steak. Although she had offered to bring the correct steak I had had enough at this point and ate it anyways in an effort to leave ASAP. 

This is the second time we dined at this particular restaurant and the first time was nothing to brag about either. I've never written a review for anything in my life but was so disgusted by my experience tonight that I felt the need to warn others."}
{"text":"This longhorn is so bad. Not just one bad experience, but THREE.  The food is atrocious.  Fries have way too much seasoning and salt.  The \"filet\" was the most disgusting piece of meat I've ever seen. stay far far away!"}
{"text":"The food was good. But he gave us a buzzer and there was tables wide open for us to eat at. Then it took a half hour before we ordered our food.we ordered appetizers and they didn't even get there until our food was there. And then it took a while for food to get there."}
{"text":"The service was fine and responsive to our needs.  The shrimp with peppers was good and had some kick due to the peppers.  The filet was good but not great and the loaded potato was also tasty.  I would eat here again and recommend but the meat quality is not top shelf."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  I'm still seating here with my son and the only reason we tried this place for lunch was because I was given a gift card for Christmas.  I will never be back.  We came here at 2 and waited 30 mins for a table and only about 1/3 of the tables were full.  I ordered an app and wanted chips instead of bread, bread came out.  My son had a burger well done, it was pretty close to burnt on the outside he could only eat less than half of it.  But my biggest complaint is the French onion soup I had with my meal, it was so sweet I couldn't eat it.  Jeremy our server asked if he could bring out another and I said only if it will taste different, the next one that came out was the same, very sweet I couldn't eat it.  Jeremy apologized but never offered a manager or another option or to take it off my bill, just said sorry that's how the soup is.  So I paid for something I couldn't even eat.  Never ever coming back here again especially with the other options right next door."}
{"text":"The food quality here is consistently good.  

The Texas Tonion is my favorite \"onion\" at all the Steakhouse chains and the Firecracker Chicken Wraps are my favorite appetizer.   

The Filet is always tender and cooked to perfection.  Whenever I don't get the Filet, I get the Renegade Sirloin.  Love the seasoning on the Renegade."}
{"text":"My sister is in town and since this place is 5 minutes from my house, she insisted we eat there. I've already had one bad experience here so I suggested Patron or even the juice bar at LA Fitness since I had no desire to come back. But she's my only sister so I went.

It took a few minutes to get greeted and sat which was weird since there was no additional people at the vestibule area. It was messy. Several unbussed tables. I stopped counting at 6 as we were led to our table. Gross.

Server was a bit of precocious jerk. Juliane or something equally obnoxious. She had an arrogant way about her and I immediately lost interest in whatever recommendation she had. She kept annoying us during our meal, too. No sweetheart, I don't care about you moving cross country to New Mexico or Colorado or where the fuck ever it is. Gurl you take that high school education elsewhere, not at my table sweet cheeks. 

We ordered an appetizer that came quickly but wasn't cooked through so we had to send it back. Then our meals arrived. And almost at the end our appetizer made it back. Disappointing to say the least. 

My ribeye was horribly under seasoned and over cooked. My sister was fine with her filet even though they over cooked that, too. At that point it was just easier to eat it than to complain. Some female manager seemed bothered by another table and from her body language I felt if sent these steaks back then we'd get judged. Or worse. It's like no one liked working that shift or something. Not a lot of smiles when greeted. 

And I wish people would teach servers that this is just a business transaction, I don't care about your personal lives.

My sister paid so I guess it's not really my loss. I'll be back when someone else is picking up the tab but only then."}
{"text":"Food was amazing...had prime rib and it melted in your mouth. Service was good even as busy as they were."}
{"text":"A decent steak for a chain restaurant. We went there 12-2012. I had the ribeye, it was very good except that their idea of medium, is actually med-well. Service was average and fairly slow...but it was quite busy.  My one huge turnoff was when walking through the front doors, 3 guys were outside smoking and we had to walk through a disgusting tunnel of smoke. Not cool. Get those smokers away from the FRONT DOORS."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to longhorn steakhouse and the meal was excellent.. Grilled chicken Parmesan cooked to perfection.. Juicy chicken wonderfully seasoned. Fully loaded Idaho potato baked just rght.. Fresh garden salad and hot tea to help warm me on ths cold evening.. My server very nice and welcoming.."}
{"text":"I so love this place. The atmosphere is great, but most of all the staff is excellent!  Lord the food is the best, I feel in love with their sweet tea! Thanks for caring about your  customers."}
{"text":"i came here to eat with my wife, i was craving a porterhouse steak and my wife was craving a filet mignon with lobster tail. when i came out to your table i didnt recieve my porterhouse instead they gave me a T-bone steak. i was very disappointed weather they dont know their steaks or they ran out of porter and gave me a look a like.  my steak only came with 2 peices of meat instead of its usual 3 that makes the porter house. my wifes filet mignon was a weak sirloin and the lobster tail was disappointing. first time here and im never going back. texas road house will continue to be my steak house. longhorn steakhouse was a great disappointment."}
{"text":"A steakhouse but kind of upscale.  Lots of variety on the menu; good combos; portion size decent; wonderful homemade bread; delicious steak, soup, salad, and dessert.  Great location.  We've gone a few times and will again.  Highly recommend.  Even vegetarians can find nice options, as can pescatarians."}
{"text":"Update to the previous review:  Went back a few weeks ago with my mom and an out of town friend.  The server mentioned in the first review was our server again and recognized us after a whole year!  He apologized for the poor service the last time and said it was his first night on the job and we were his first customers.  He really went out of his way to make up for the last visit!  Outstanding service, even complimentary dessert and walked us out and held the door for my handicapped mom!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Came here with girlfriend for late lunch today for the first time.   Being an ex bartender and server I am very easy going when it comes to service.  Everyday people dont understand the stress of the food service industry.   But even so I felt the need to write this review.   Ill keep it simple it took our server 10 mins to greet us at table.  45 mins for food to come out!   Our server stopped by table just once in the 45 minutes.   Not once did i see floor manager.   Our burgers came out luke warm and fries were cold.  I honestly and full heartly can say this was worst dining experience Ive ever had.  Will not return obviously!"}
{"text":"Experience was fine until dinner came. I uploaded a picture of my $7.99 upgrade to filet. As any butler can tell. This was not a filet. The manager attempted to tell us they use different sizes base on what temperature you order. So as far as steak house goes. It's apparent no one knows what they are talking about. Patrick our server was great in a positive note."}
{"text":"During the dinner hours the food is normally great.  I haven't gone there many times for lunch.  I have noticed that the service has gone downhill a lot since they opened.  We went there with a party of eight recently and were there for over two hours!"}
{"text":"Best steak - Flo's Filet done mid-rare!!! 
Service is terrific and always helpful! We go here for our special dinners and are never disappointed. 
One time my steak had a line of gristle through it-the server immediately replaced it. This is the BEST steakhouse in Pittsburgh!! ... okay maybe Ruth's Chris is up there but parking there is atrocious-"}
{"text":"First time I ever had salmon that was  not cooked all the way. If I wanted sushi, would of done Japanese. Last time going there."}
{"text":"First of all,  service was great. 

Ordered the renegade sirloin, 8oz.  I wish I would have taken a picture.  I swear to you the steak was no more than 3/8\" thick and about 3\"x3.5\". I requested my steak medium and you can't cook a steak that thin to any level of deliciousness.  I couldn't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak.  Let alone an 8oz renegade sirloin.  The fries had certainly been around for a while.  Sent the dish back. I'll stick to the outback."}
{"text":"This is Christmas Eve and we decided to go out for dinner the line was extremely long even though I called and made a reservation it still took 40 minutes to get in but I'll tell you what it was well worth the wait the waitress was very pleasant and easy to talk to we had prime rib which came out dry as a bone so we sent it back and got ribeye steaks oh what a difference the flavor was awesome and come to find out the manager bought my meal I will definitely come back and recommend highly to anybody the food is awesome here a little expensive but so delicious well worth the money and the time to wait"}
{"text":"The steaks were cooked just perfect. Less of their heavy seasoning which was great. The salads and dressing were just right. Had the new brisket nacho. I didn't care for the cheese on them but the boys liked them. Sam Adams beer was awesome"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in we were greeted by a hostess. We were seated a waiter by the name of Shawn came over, he asked us for our drinks then proceeded to ask did we want to start off with an appetizer we both said no. I asked for a sweet tea my boyfriend asked for a bud light and a water. There were only two coasters on the table so he turned to get another off the pile the servers use and slung it on our table yes such force it moved the other two coasters. My boyfriend and I looked at each other In disbelief, i then said well maybe he's had a bad day. We were sitting about two minutes we observed Shawn talking to the table behind us then coming back out with a glass of water still no drinks for us. The second table he was waiting on needed a bag to put their leftover containers in he went to go get it. Still no drinks. After about five minutes still no drinks, acknowledgments or anything. We got up to leave."}
{"text":"Just ate at Longhorn Steakhouse - worst service - EVER. Took over an hour to get food. Everyone's baked potato was ice cold. Waiter brought hot ones after 10 minutes, then meat was cold. Talked to 2 different managers who refused to offer ANYTHING. Will never go there again. Way too many good places to eat who care if people return."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite resturants to visit, we go about 1-2 times a month. Food is great and the prices are good as well. Service is awesome too."}
{"text":"I just went there for my sisters graduation lunch. She had called ahead about two hours. We went in with a party of 9. The restaurant was empty but yet we had to wait for 20 mins. When we finally got to our table the waiter did get our drinks quickly but the worst part was that when we finally ordered the food took about 45 mins to get there. We didnt have anymore drinks and the manager would pass by and not even acknowledge that we needed needed help. Not once did he stop by to ask how we were doing. I would have totally gone across the street to Texas Roadhouse instead. I didnt like the food or the service. Not very many options to choose from.. I will never be back. First and last time."}
{"text":"Great meal. We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and hey we're AWESOME! I had the ribeye which was done to perfection. My mom had the filet which she enjoyed throughly enjoyed also. Our waiter Eric was great when we wanted to wait in between courses he gave us our time. We didn't need to ask for anything. It was like he read our minds. Thanks Eric!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location. Service is not professionally trained and the manager isn't engaged with her restaurant.  Tables are left dirty and the kitchen is out of stock on many items.  I visited at 8 PM JAN 1st 2014. Darned usually runs a better restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times in the 2 months I have lived in Surprise. Great food, great staff and great atmosphere. So far its my favorite eatery in town. 
I have had both Ribeye and the Strip. All good choices."}
{"text":"The restaurant and corporate did follow up with me. They sent a letter of apology, refunded the overcharge, and gave us a decent gift card to give them another chance. My wife and I were hesitant to use the gift card at this location, but that's what we ended up doing. That visit was definitely better than the previous one. For the response to my complaint, I thank the management and corporate office for their sincere concern and willingness to make the situation better. They did all this within a month of that first fateful visit. I know this was a year ago, but I thought it would only be fair to them to post a follow-up to my scathing review.

Based on the second visit, it may not be the best steak house in the area, but we would go back again if we hadn't moved out of the area."}
{"text":"Worst steakhouse I've been 2.   Very clean inside but my food was subpage.   Ice cold fried.   Rubbery burger.    Wouldn't go here ever again"}
{"text":"If this was my first time there, I would not return. We were seated at 6, ordered at 6:15; food arrived at 7:15.   Very poor service. The food was not up to their standards and service was horrible. May never go back.   The place is going downhill. Kay S"}
{"text":"What stands out is that the professionalism of the staff needs to take it up a big notch. We waited a solid four minutes before we were greeted at the door to be seated which I can understand if it's really busy, but as we were leaving there were three hostesses or servers standing at the hostess desk chatting....all three of them were too busy to say thank you for coming in or goodbye. I was shocked because they all saw us leave and didn't say anything. 

In regards to the food I had the shrimp... It was good but not good enough to order again. I didn't care for the rice that was paired with the shrimp. I will say though that the mashed potatoes were delicious... My guess is because they were covered in butter (not healthy but tasty). If you order a margarita they will give you a generous portion so that is good too."}
{"text":"Good food, as long as you don't need your steak cooked how you want it. Manager seems very nice but had no follow through. Mediocre experience that cost ~$40 per person and was not great"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Really great food, I had the steak and shrimp, it was so good. The asparagus appetizer is so good too, I love fried pickles but the fried asparagus may make me change my ways.  With a party of 10 we didn't wait long to be seated,  but because it was busy we did wait a really long to get served our entrees. The appetizers did cone quickly though."}
{"text":"We come to longhorn occasionally, They always cook the steak how we order it, the wait staff is always friendly! sometimes i think under the tables is a little dirty but other than that the food and service are great."}
{"text":"This restaurant was disappointing..  The place is new and looked OK but lacked ambiance.  The help was courteous but seemed inexperienced.  The steak was sub-par in tenderness and very diffcult on the digestive system.  VERY spicy.  I like spicy food but this steak went over the top to the point of making one nauseous.  Both husbands felt the same way.  One of the wives had a lobster and she thought it one of the best from a steakhouse chain.  The other wife had a chicken salad which we also very good.  Maybe I'll go back for the lobster but never for steak."}
{"text":"Dirty. Poorly managed. We tried to get a table, half the restaurant was open, but we were told it would be 30\" min. Grimy, sticky floors. DO NOT GO!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was awful , she fails to come and check on us . We waited 30 minutes to finally see her again."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened to the longhorn? Just another victim of the economy? 2 cold steaks and a cold lobster tail that the\"manager\" microwaved for us when we sent it back- whatever happened to cooking a steak the way you ordered it and fixing it by cooking a new one when you did the first one wrong ? The \"manager\" needs to spend less time chit -chatting with friends (15 minutes!) and more time making things right for the other patrons. I'm sorry Longhorn, but I don't think we can see each other anymore. :("}
{"text":"Absolutely Devine! The steak just melted in my mouth.  I didn't give  5 stars because I like it when your server has a big personality. It would have made more of an impact.  Service is always key to return guests. Whom ever cooks the steak you did awesome! ! If you put A1 on your steak you should get smacked by the Chef.. Because that would be an insult."}
{"text":"Avoid this place, go next door to Texas Road House. Service much better food come out in a timely manner. Decided to give this place a try on Fathers Day we never got our food. When we asked to speak to the manager the server never went to get the manager. The restaurant was very unprepared for volume of people. Food was taking hours to come out. We had to ask two servers and a host  before the manager came over."}
{"text":"I got there around 5 and was one of the only ppl in the restaurant. I wanted something to go so the hostess (very politely) sent me to the bar. The guy took my order and promptly brought me my beer and check and never spoke to me again. 20ish minutes later I saw someone bring a bag out and set it on the bar. I figured it was someone else's food since the bartender (who was engrossed in conversation) didn't bring it to me. After several minutes the bartender broke from his conversation and brought me the awaiting bag. All in all it was about 30 minutes from ordering to giving the food to me (in a mostly empty restaurant). When I got the steak home and cut into it, it was mostly brown with a hint of red in the very middle. I ordered it medium rare which the menu said would be mostly red with a hint of pink. 

I guess the moral of the story is to not order food at the bar and/or cut into your steak before you take it away because it may be WAY over done. And honestly if you're gonna order $20 something dollars worth of steak, what's the point in cooking out all the deliciousness?!"}
{"text":"Love the firecracker chicken wraps as an appetizer, wish there were a few more of those things! I ordered the parm, crusted chicken dish and it was wonderful. service is very friendly and they really aim to please! I liked them on facebook and used the free app coupon and would come back for more coupons. thanks!"}
{"text":"I liked so much, they have perfect steak I have never tasted before, in my opinion I have ordered a deal for two persons with two salad and two sides, I have the option to choose any type of steak, I ordered T-bone cooked medium well, it was really delicious and which was a good price around 50 dollars. 
I tried cheese onion soup twice, I liked the thick roasted cheese on it."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was unpleasant. Take my advise, try somewhere else. Sorry Longhorn, but you might want to mystery shop this location. 
One star for this cowboy themed dud."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in Pittsburgh for the last four years and have given this location several tries over this time frame,sadly hoping that management or ownership will change and improve the service.

We have traveled enough to know a good Steakhouse in the Middle Market and this is not one of them. All it would take is a Texas Roadhouse to open up nearby and this place was closed its doors.

There is no service, no customer appreciation, no attention to expediency. You will arrive and be greeted by neglectful teenagers, on their phones with friends hanging around the hostess stand slurping soda and talking on their phones, not paying attention. We were even told one time by one of the teenage hostesses go somewhere else if you don't like it here, I don't care...

Management is completely non-existent, Tables by the dozens lay in wait of service, dirty tables in droves unbussed while customers wait for hours for a table, it's unreal! 

We tried again tonight, same experience; the only reason we go back - we are looking for a good, medium price steak and Pittsburgh is lacking in the city, you can go out to the suburbs and find service. We finally walked out and went over to Rock Bottom and there you will find a restaurant running Top Notch! Go there before this place at all costs!

 The owner should lose his shirt with this location,but as long as this Steakhouse is the only location in the area they will continue to operate at substandard service and people continue to accept the abuse, it's sad..."}
{"text":"For a steak house they sure over cooked my steak! Ordered medium rare ( warm pink center) only thing pink at that time was my sweater!  Service so so.  The butternut risotto was to die for!  Kudos to the chef on that one! Pomegranate margarita very sweet even after I was told is was not.  A good bar tender should know the house special cocktails.  Bad visit in that area."}
{"text":"I used to go to lunch here a lot.  I think for the amonth of food its a good deal. 
But the service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"To be fair, the only reason this gets 1 star is because our waiter was really good and friendly. Typically, GREAT service will overcome lower quality food, but unfortunately for our waiter, the food was NOT at all what I expected. My wife's sirloin was overcooked, my daughter's hamburger had no flavor. $9 for this burger!!! I could have purchased 3 cheesburgers from Rod's Cafe for this price and the burgers at Rod's Cafe are MUCH tastier (I need to make an official visit there and write a review). Her french fries must have been frozen. McDonalds....show them how to make fries, please. My ribeye, which was cooked as I like ALSO had NO flavor. And the menu lists this as the cut of meat with the MOST flavor. WOW, I would hate to taste the other cuts. It was a good thing I waited until this morning to write this review, because I woke up at 3am with acid reflux, most likely due to the steak I ate. I guess my money is used to maintain the BEAUTIFUL decor. NEVER again will I visit this place again."}
{"text":"Wait was a bit longer than we were told. Food was good for the most part except for the seven pepper salad that had the over cooked steak buried in it. If the server would have checked after service it would not have been as bad. We had to get up and find the manager to find that he wasn't all oriented toward customer service. Seven pepper steak salad did not seem to be as good as in the past."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of this place I was a little worried, but my parents chose this place when I offered to treat them to dinner. For appetizers we ordered the sweet chili calamari and the crab artichoke dip. Both appetizers were tasty. My Fiance and I ordered the porterhouse for 2, with a side of broccoli and the sweet potato. We ordered the porterhouse in-between medium and medium rare. I was worried because other reviews have said their steaks were over cooked and some said it was under cooked. So I was hoping they would get it right. When our steak came, the porterhouse was resting on the 2 knives, so the knives were covered in oil. I had to request another knife because my hand was getting greasy. As predicted, the steak was overcooked. The strip steak side was well done and the filet side was closer to medium. The steak didn't have much flavor. The broccoli was a little over cooked (unless your prefer your broccoli soggy). I was not impressed by this place. However, service was good."}
{"text":"Here is the issue. My party and I arrived at dinner time on Friday night. We didn't mind waiting. Our table was nice and the food was good. However, the server, and occasionally other random servers, clearly wanted our table turned as quickly as possible and tried to achieve this by clearing plates away before we were finished eating. Our server came over and tried to take our plates, we said no, we were still eating, and asked for more bread. Then another server tried to clear our plates less than five minutes later, then another after that. The bread never came so again, a server came and tried clearing the plates we were not done with, and we asked for bread yet again. Now we had requests in with two different employees for bread, but it never came. Finally, one of the three servers who seemed to be tag teaming our table, came by and asked AGAIN if he could take my plate (let me eat for goodness sakes) and I said no, but asked for bread a 3rd time. We finally received the bread, and barely touched it before one of the 3 rotating servers grabbed the basked and tried to take it away. I had to take it back out of his hands. So we tucked the bread toward the back of the table and within five minutes, one of the rotating servers asked me to hand it to him. Again, we had to tell him no. This was seriously annoying and ridiculous. Someone in my party ordered 2 meals to go for those who couldn't join us, and our main server got down on his knee like he was telling her a big secret, and told her she should hurry with her decision about which meals she would be ordering to-go because they were 'backing up in the kitchen.' The only goal any of these servers tried to achieve, was to get us out so they could turn the table. Beware of this strategy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on 10/13/2011 around 12:30pm. Had 1/2 prime rib sandwich, and lobster chowder soup. Soup turned out to be OK, nothing to write home about. I pick up my sandwich and just as I was about to take a bite...I saw a BLACK CURLY HAIR on my sandwich!!! I immediately sent it back and asked for a manager. 

The managing partner came out right away. He seemed very sincere and apologetic for what had happened.  Not only did he comp my meal, he also comped my girlfriend's meal, AND gave me a $15 gift card to use at another time.  

In my opinion, he handled this situation exactly the way it should of been handled!   Even though I had a bad experience here, I will return and give them another chance!  The managing partner was going above and beyond in order to keep my business.  I appreciate his attitude and his customer service skills!  Thanks to him, I will return to give the Champaign Longhorn a second chance!"}
{"text":"Food: They definitely make great ribs and ribeye steaks. They cook it exactly the way I like and there's a lot of flavor! The complimentary bread and butter is average. 

Service: Excellent service. Our server was very friendly and funny but not try hard funny. 

Ambience: It was a casual dine in. It wasn't very busy when we went, but it was also a weekday and late at night.

Parking: They have a small lot that they share, but if wasn't difficult to find parking. 

Overall, great experience and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse.  Only one issue the whole meal.  Our appetizer came out cold.  Waiter John did an awesome job and made it right .  Definitely would go again.  Steak cooked to perfection.  Drinks were kept full!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in last night for a late supper.  Our waitress was great and very friendly.  Everything we ordered came out quickly and was very tasty.  We've dined at this location at least a handful of times over the past few years and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Delicious, great service,huge portions,took bae for his bday and he was pleased,next time well take the family"}
{"text":"I love steak and I would love to write a good review here. But I won't. The steaks here are decent at best, I expect that from the company that owns this chain though. Last time I went it was with my family, my brother had chewed gum stuck to his plate, they were out of two dishes my family wanted to order, and my mother found a shrimp tail in her ice cream. Very gross. For some reason the burger I got had a weird taste/smell on the bun. I'd recommend one if the many better streak places in Strongsville or one of the hibachis."}
{"text":"Three stars is still ok.  Got dinner at the bar.  Food was good, service was good, but I ordered dessert to go.  Big mistake as I would have sent it back.  I was looking forward to  a nice slice of Banana Cream Pie.  Big disappointment!  Got home and it was microscopic!  There is no way any employee should have served this.  There were zero, wait ZERO, wait NO BANANAS in the pie.  Nor was it more than three bites!  It ruined all the points they scored.  Dessert (profit) will never be ordered again. I was looking forward to this.  Might be back but dessert is definitely off the agenda.  Seriously, three bites, nada mas.....Sorry."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding service. My wife and I went here for her birthday and they treated us like family! Food was terrific all around, our mussels were fresh, our hand chopped salads crisp and flavorful and the steaks were mouth watering. The manager Abraham Orozco was incredibly professional and helpful. The server Maureen was so nice and she took the time to chat with us and was super friendly to our 14 month old daughter! I highly recommend this steak house!"}
{"text":"Just finished Sunday lunch at this Longhorn, which we have visited many times in the past.  This was not a stellar experience.  We stood at the hostess station for several minutes before someone even noticed us.  The person who seated us turned out to be our waiter.  He immediately asked our beverage choice, and returned with those relatively quickly, and took our appetizer order.  Shortly after that was delivered...by someone else...our waiter took our entree order.  I ordered soup instead of salad, and my husband had double sides instead of soup or salad.  After finishing my soup, we waited for quite a long time for our meal...our waiter was passing our table repeatedly, but never cleared our appetizer plate or my soup bowl.  Finally he appeared with our entrees and apologized for the long wait.  What were supposed to be roasted carrots...my side and my husband's double side...looked sad and rather overcooked, as though they had been sitting for a while, and were lukewarm at best.  The waiter never returned to our table to inquire how our food was, or we would have commented that the carrots were cold and lackluster.  He also had difficulty keeping my husband's Coke refilled, and at one point I was close to getting up and taking a pitcher from a nearby table and refilling my own water glass.  Finally, at the end, after we had finished, he returned and asked how everything was.  When my husband told him the carrots were cold, he scooped up the still half full plate and carried it off.  A few minutes later someone else...we later learned it was the manager...returned with the carrots and said \"here are your reheated carrots.\"  We never asked for them to be reheated, and we certainly weren't going to eat them then, when we already had our credit card out.  The manager took our bill, subtracted the carrots, and then returned to our table and proceeded to profusely apologize.  We told him we had been there many times, but this was definitely not a good day.  He acknowledged that he knew that, and apologized again.  I think the corker came when my husband was signing the credit slip and the waiter returned, arms laden with dirty dishes from other tables, and asked if he could clear our table as well, which would have required his reaching over the two of us.  I had visions of who knows what landing In our laps.  There were not that many tables with diners, although there was one very large table.  I don't know if it was a function of too few staff scheduled or what, but this was definitely not a great experience.  We'll go back, in all likelihood, as their food is definitely good, but I hope it's on a better service day."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful experience this evening.  The Porterhouse was amazing, cooked to perfection, service was superior, and the management and the server both were very kind.  When we go back, we are going to try the lobster tails our neighbors ordered for some variety.  We are creatures of habit when it comes to ordering.  If I had family, business, or any event where you want an enjoyable atmosphere, I would go here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to any LongHorse Steakhouse and my wife and I were impressed with both the food and the service. 

It should be noted that we did arrive during a slow period between lunch and dinner so we did have a server mostly to ourselves, and were only sharing the restaurant with a half-dozen other parties.

Our waiter was attentive, but not oppresively so.  We had our drinks and he didn't ask us if we wanted refills until we were almost through.  He knew the menu and the sides by heart and didn't try to push desert.

The atmosphere was well-lit but cozy, the decorations were observable.  I'll go back there again, but this review will stand unless something is really wrong.  Thank you, LongHorn Steakhouse."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this restaurant is was just right the food the service everything was great! I just went there to eat this past Monday and it was the complete opposite of my first visit. The service was terrible I guess my server had too many tables and was unable to put in my order for appetizers 5 minutes before my food arrived. And to top it off my daughter had hair in her mashed potatoes! Yuck! Oh one more thing... This place was very nasty and dirty.. The carpets were covered in food and there menu's had all kind of BBQ sauce wiped and smeared across them very uncomfortable very! I will never return to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place at all! 
Decent prices, nice enough staff, clean surroundings.
  I had a perfectly prepared t bone with mushrooms and onions that must have come from Gods garden, they were that good! 
  The sweet potato side is always a treat... I get mine with a little butter only...you don't need the cinnamon sugar. The salad and bread are nothing special, but not at all terrible. 
  I also had a Bacardi and coke that was not skimpy on the rum, it was skimpy on the coke and thats a good thing."}
{"text":"I've been to Longhorn a few times, but the last couple times in this location were not impressive. Most recently, my wife and I were sat quickly, but it took fifteen minutes to be greeted. The Texes Tunion app was nearly chilled by the time we got it, and unenjoyable. We finished our drinks and were never brought new ones, even after asking. The dinner took forever, was only half right and over cooked. Then, wanting only to leave, we waited dreadfully for another twenty minutes to get the check. We only had a card, and waited another twenty to have it brought back. After two hours and ten minutes, we couldnt wait to get out of there. Bad experience. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"I get the chicken parm hubby gets a steak. the rice and baked potatoes are wonderful. The ceasar salad when it's fresh is wonderful! you really must go there."}
{"text":"THis is a new location, hasn't been open very long. Def gotta go. The servers and staff were all very nice and the food was great!"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive. Food prices are reasonable. I've had excellent steak except for one and they comp the problem for me.  Can't ask for a better place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a decent place in Champaign for steak. The service is always good. Steaks are the same every time. You can rely on the reliability of this restaurant. Good cocktail choices."}
{"text":"Here for our first time. Excellent service from start to finish. We had the rib eye steaks which were cooked to perfection, and our waitress Rachel was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this afternoon with a friend of mine...  The service was quick and the food was relatively good.  It took awhile for the server to drop off the check, but we were chatting and hadn't requested it.  All said, I was impressed that longhorn is still around and has made itself relevant for lunch.  I did notice that most of the dining room was over 60, but that says it was a weekday afternoon when most would be at work."}
{"text":"This restaurant only has a 3-star rating. That's because of poor service and an overall lack of a good management skills.  We experienced 90 min. of slow service and lack of attention (clearing dirty plates, slow delivery & refilling of drinks). 
The tipping point for our party of 4:  1 individual received their meal while the other 3 waited 5-7 min longer for theirs to arrive. Very awkward.  When the  filet steak finally arrived, it was COLD. Person (not our waitress) who delivered meals did not clear away empty salad bowls and did not linger. No immediate follow up by our waitress. Consequently, the cold steak was eaten. Finally when waitress came back, we expressed dissatisfaction with cold steak. Manager came later. Expressed same opinion again. No apology or acknowledgement received from the manager except to provide another steak.  Really?  We were already 90 min in the chair. Instead, her attitude was defensive. This is too bad. An apology with an explanation can go a long way with a customer. \"Sorry, we're short staffed tonight\" or whatever. Instead the check was delivered to us without explanation. Found steak removed from total bill. Which we were glad of, but the manner in which this was done was completely unprofessional and did nothing to encourage these diners to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First And last Time.
1. Appetizers. The onion was cold,the calamari was like rubber they made me another and it was the same. what a disappointment
2. Full rack of Baby back Ribs  COLD the only thing hot on my plat was the squash.
3 wife had prime rib same thing COLD very fatty and the flavor not worth the price"}
{"text":"Lunch service is terrible. The bartender is old and slow. We were having to wait long periods of time for refills, and our lunch(2burgers and a kids chicken finger) took an hour and a half to get to the table!!!! I counted the guests in the building- there were 6 people!!! The booths are way to far from the tables, my toddler kept slipping off her chair trying to reach her food. Worst part of my lunch was when I reached down to pick up my purse off the floor and seen the pile of old garbage and silverware that had piled up on the sides of the booths by the walls, how can a manager let servers leave at night without cleaning that up?! It was 2 inches high!!! I did talk to a manager and she was nice, in fact she was the only good part about lunch today."}
{"text":"I love going to this Longhorn. Every time we show up they give us great service and the food is always cooked exactly how we order it. Manager Chad is awesome and always comes around to greet guests. Our regular server is AJ and he provides excellent service along with friendly conversation."}
{"text":"Omgoodness! Went with the other reviews and tried Genaro's. This was some of the best food ever and we eat out a lot, everywhere and all cuisines. The rotisserie chicken held up to the reviews as the BEST we've  ever had! The sauces were crazy fantastic too. From the Aguadito soup to the plantains to the cilantro rice to the most awesome Tres Leches. Wow. If you're in the area or anywhere  near Pineville, NC definitely recommend. Service and recommendations  from Luis were greatly appreciated  as well. 5 stars. We are bookmarking  this one and are so happy it's only 1/2 hour away:-)"}
{"text":"They have a brindle steer. Not every Longhorn can boast they have one. The food and drinks are good.  The staff is good. The steer makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"Food and service were horrible. It was a Monday evening so they were not busy at all. No excuse for constantly having to flag down the waitress for more drinks and water. 

I could tell the filet was tough immediately when I tried to cut it. Unbelievable that their best cut of meat could be this tough. It was done properly but just chewed like it was rubber. Gave up after two or three bites. My friend had the same thing and agreed his was bad also. Asparagus was stringy and cold. Will never go again."}
{"text":"The food was great. We got Smokehouse wings as a starter and they had lots of flavor and were delicious. The only thing I have to complain about is the wait. Our 30 minute wait turned into an hour and a half wait because the hostess erased our name on the computer twice. Our buzzer never went off and our name was never called. But unless you get as unlucky as we did your time would be great."}
{"text":"The price is pretty high considering the mediocre steak. Seems to be in good business, perhaps because it is beside the theater."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would... they need to burn the place down and start over. The place was filthy as soon a we walked in, so many tables needed bused and stilled needed it when we finally left. Service was awful, took forever for drink orders.. salads took 20 minutes to come out.. followed quickly by our food. Steak was completely inedible, slathered in whatever seasoning they used, it didn't even taste like steak, just a salty mess. Manager told me next time to order light seasoning... I shouldn't have to, you're a steak house, you should know how to cook steak. All around terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food and service were great! You can tell it's a new environment-beginners ya know but everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! These white ladies came in after us yet the guy waiter in the front desk ask for the white ladies to sit first! FYI, It wasn't busy in the dining room at all. Waited 1 hour to be seated. Everyone just stared at me and my family (asian). Totally zero stars if it was an option. I ordered medium outlaw ribeye but got rare. Asked the server about my ribeye and he said \"okay, I'll fix right for you, heating it.\" Came back and seemed like they put it inside the microwave. Still did not look medium cooked."}
{"text":"We ended up waiting more than an hour after our salads for our food to come out. After about 55 minutes of waiting with no waiter, a manager finally came up to us and explained that they had just changed kitchen slip printers and did not bother looking at the old printer for the last order on it, so our receipt was just sitting there and no one noticed (or cared that we were sitting in their restaurant not eating for so long).

There were people who came more than a half hour after us who had FINISHED eating before we got our food.

The parmesan crusted chicken was at least a bit tasty so it received another star for that."}
{"text":"Most terrible experience I've ever had at a restaurant. First it was a 15 minute wait and it was 30 minutes then when we got to our table we had to wait another 40 minutes to get our salad then we also had to wait an additional 10 minutes to get our main meals which my wife had  10-ounce filet mignon and I had a T-bone steak. My T-bone steak was at room  temperature when I got it and it was a bit on the salty side my wife's filet mignon was cooked correctly but it had so much seasoning and salt on it that it completely overpowered the steak. So all-in-all I'll never go to this place again for the terrible food and service anybody reading this should never go there whether it be for the first time or as a regular customer."}
{"text":"Worst dinner experience in a while. Call ahead seating failed. Checking in failed. 40 minute wait announced. Took an hour and half till drinks were served. Service was very slow considering the restaurant had many empty tables which further begs the reason for the long wait to get seated. Salad and dinner served at the same time. SLOW SERVICE. By the way the steak was cold and no offer to compensate the horrible experience. Won't be back. The last visit wasn't as bad but two in a row, not going for three."}
{"text":"This place sucks. We waited at least 30 minutes past our quote time and then a long time for our drinks and bread when we were starving!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went to longhorn steakhouse this evening and was severed by Colton. His attention to service and exceeding the guest experience was incredible. My drinks were never empty and his personality was very welcoming, this is where amazing service creates loyalty."}
{"text":"This is going the way of so many chains lately where the quality of the ingredients and even sometimes the prep/cook is poor. We had two nicer cuts of steak,both had been over-cooked to the point of difficult to cut. They tasted like cheap cuts of meat. The drink I ordered was a mess, basically straight sour mix mixed with alcohol poured over ice  for 10 dollars. And they didn't salt the rim of the glass - it's a margarita - who forgets that? Not an experienced bartender.The one bright side was attentive service, which unfortunately can't make it ok when the quality of the ingredients and preparation in bar and kitchen are so poor."}
{"text":"Like we said on our check in this place was by far one of our favorites food was very delicious and full of taste. Our server Elizabeth made it even more of an amazing experience definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and meeting up friends.  Must try the Primetime Margarita it's 2 for the price of 1."}
{"text":"Had dinner with two other couples several months ago.  The food came out cold for all of us.  It took forever for the waitress to finally come back to our table.  We complained about the food being cold.  She had the manager come over and we were told their steaks are always cold to keep them at medium rare.  I vowed I would never return.  A few weeks ago I had company from out of town and they wanted a steak.  Since getting into the Texas Roadhouse was nearly impossible I took them to Longhorn.  I again ordered steak medium rare and it came out perfect.  The food was warm and we all enjoyed the meal.  I did find the prices to be higher and the portions smaller so I will probably go elsewhere for steak but I was glad that a return visit is no longer out of the question."}
{"text":"Woody is a great waiter and the food was outstanding
Cedric the asst manger stopped by twice so the food matched the service"}
{"text":"I love this place! 
When we went there our server was so sweet! We had never been there before and she went over everything with us.. as we had to pay attention to ingredients do to my partner's health.. she even went back to the kitchen several times to make sure of the ingredients she wasn't sure of.. our steaks were perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were good too! Not a fan of the Mac and cheese! But I would go back again"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!! Bought a gift card a week ago. Supposed to be a father son treat with my 7 yr old. Picked up the pager when I arrived. Pager went off - we were told to wait. Meantime another couple who had arrived later - there pager went off - while we were waiting - and they were seated first?!! I asked to speak to the manager - I am generally not one to complain. A woman came out - then a man - Scott C. It was like talking to a piece of drywall. Really! While I was talking ANOTHER couples pager went off and they were seated! I asked Scott - he lied and said that we didn't want to eat there??!!! I then asked to have my gift card cashed - he said no. So I offered my $50 card for $40 to the remaining people who were waiting just to get the heck out of there! I really do think they hate kids at this Longhorn so if you have to go - go at your own risk. And if your lucky Scott C won't be there the night that you go. And if you have kids - trust me - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We recently found this place and we can't stop coming back.  I always get the ribeye steak. It's always delicious I finished the whole steak each time. The servers are always friendly, we never have to wait long to be seated or for our food. This is our new favorite place! Oh and don't forget to try the spiked orange ale, so refreshing :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to go here for dinner tonight - 11/17/2012 with another couple.  My friend called to get call ahead seating.  She was put on hold.   It took us 15 minutes from the time she was put on hold until we arrived at the place and walked in.   When the hostess asked how many, etc - my friend said I'm still on hold for call ahead seating.  The hostess turned around, saw the phone blinking and said I forgot, we're busy.  When we walked in, no customers were at the hostess stand and she was talking to another girl that was standing there with her.  We probably would've stayed if it wasn't for the attitude of the hostess.  We left and found somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"We had chicken,  steak and prime rib. The onion appetizer was great as our waitress said it would be. Everyone's  entree was delectable.  I  am glad we used the call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Well as I sit here waiting on my food to be delivered I thought I would go ahead and start my review since I have plenty of time to spare... 

So it started off slow, we had already reviewed the menu and picked out what we wanted to eat by the time the waitress came to the table. My wife's meal came with a side salad which she said was OK. 

Food's here!

Wife said the filet was good but dry. I got the Chicken and Strawberry salad. It was good, but they drowned it in raspberry vinaigrette. It was so strong it would curl your lips... Recommend dressing on the side. The salad also had a lot of stems in it. 

Started off slow but the waitress was nice and upbeat. And the manager was going around checking on everyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We used to frequent TX Roadhouse but I like the quieter more upscale atmosphere here much better for our date nights. Steaks are always cooked exactly how we ask, and we've consistently had excellent servers who don't make us feel rushed."}
{"text":"0 star. What a terrible experience we had. I took my wife out for a Friday night date. They brought her main dish without the chicken. When they brought it, it was raw. It took 5 minutes for the waitress to come to check if it was right. By them the evening was ruined. The worst experience. We'll not go back there again. Terrible, awful service, they didn't even try to fix it. There attitude was like if they didn't care."}
{"text":"Originally we had decided to go to texas roadhouse for dinner but as we arrived we had a change of mind and decided to try out this steakhouse which is right next door.  Our biggest issue was the waitress , she was rude and pushy. Idk what her deal was but every question we had she answered it with an attitude  .I  wanted a refill on my drink and i literally considered walking up to the hostess to ask for the waitress because she was no where to be seen. She finally comes back and i say can i get a refill and she swipes my cup away doesnt ask my girlfriend if she wants a refill on her water.  Food wasent all that great either , ceasar salad was gross ate only 1/4 of it and left it to the side. Steak are ok nothing special , talked to the manager about the waitress and her customer service .  Terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Longhorn restaurant in a very long time, but I have to say that I am mildly impressed.  I liked the decor a lot. The food and drinks were on par and the service was timely, friendly and efficient. The menu had lot of variety with well prepared items. Pricing was fair with drinks and dessert. I give Longhorns 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go. Worst service. Waiting times. After waiting  one hour and forty five minutes food arrives but no more drinks.  to bad this is a new location not planing to go back any time soon ..."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken bites is not spicy and not as good as other dishes.

Highly recommend Chedar burger and the salmon in the farm salad!"}
{"text":"Been staying down the road for the past few weeks for work, and have eaten here several times during my stays. All I can say is that when Dino is not behind the bar, service takes a major dive off a cliff. Male bartender tonight (finally got my check, his name is Michael) was short, not rude but short, and disappeared to a table in the corner of what may be his buddies most of the time while there this evening. Steak was overdone and barely any butter with my baked potato, but after over 5 minutes of waiting to let him know i just went ahead and ate it. I realize tonight is the potential clincher for the Indians, but if you didn't want to be at work you should've gotten someone to cover for you, bud. 4+ stars on experience when Dino is here, not so much when he's not."}
{"text":"When I want a good steak, I always go to LongHorn Steakhouse, the sirloin is my favorite, but the Filet is excellent as well. I usually get the mac and cheese but also love a good baked potato with my steak sometimes and you can't go wrong with either choice, both are a great compliment to the delicious piece of beef. There are times when the service can be a little slow, usually because they are so busy, but all in all
a good place to get a great steak and the mac and cheese is worth
the trip all by itself, with prices that won't break the bank, definitely
worth a look see if your a fan of a good steak."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful and hospitable throughout our dinner. The food was amazing. I definitely recommend a blue cheese crusted outlaw ribeye. It's absolutely to die for. We went on a Monday around four thirty. We didn't have to wait for a table and our server came up to us right away."}
{"text":"A fire destroyed this location in Gastonia, we watched them knock it down yesterday. We hope they will rebuild ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was inviting and well done and the noise level as appropriate for conversation. The wine list was excellent but by the glass was a little short for prices. The food was cooked as ordered and portions generous. The Key Lime pie was made with real Key Limes and was best we've had in the valley. Will repeat although a little bit of a drive  for us."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner saturday night with a party of five. We called ahead an got on the wait list (they don't do reservations, but you can call ahead and be put on the wait list up to 30 mins before you arrive) we were seated within 10mins of arriving. We were promptly greeted by the server. Drinks and appetizers also came out quickly. Dinner followed as expected. Service was great, food was also good, everyone was completely satisfied.

One item to point out - I had the rib eye, it was cooked fine and completely ok for me,  but they do use a generous amount of seasoning salt, next time I will ask for light seasoning."}
{"text":"I enjoy going back because of Tim. I wish he was there during the week. I keep coming back only on weekends because of Tim. He makes me feel comfortable, he is easy to talk to and he makes me feel like a part of the Longhorn Family. I want 8 - 10 of those steak knives too. Thanks for always making me feel welcome. You're a keeper. Tell them I need you during the week too, just a suggestion. You're the top reason I come back and recommend you to others"}
{"text":"we had a great time celebrating birthdays with family!
Jeff (the manager) was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"very disappointed in the service the the staff is very disoriented the management lacks leadership it looks like they just hired anyone to hurry up and open the place"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday night at 10:30 and the manager told me were closed when in the window it clearly say closed at 11:00 pm when I confronted him about it he called the cops on me wanting to intimidate me I said call the just waist my tax payers money on stupid stuff that u cannot take care of your self 1030 and the guy would not serve me I was going to pay and give them a good tip because of the hour he call the cops on me so I'm not planing on going to that place again may another on just not that restaurant he's just a manager fix my dinner I pay I leave simple transaction what so hard about that I bet the owner of the establishment would not like to be these comment about the guy he has in charge of he's restaurant..."}
{"text":"Can't Comment on the food yet. Called ahead and had an approved reservation for 5:30 for a group that could have sat at 2 two tables. Have watched 10 other groups with no reservations be seated as well as a group of 17 with a reservation for 6pm. We have now waited for almost an hour for our \"reserved table\"."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to be fantastic! No matter what mood you are in (food wise) ;) they have everything you could want and it's AWESOME! Flo's Filet is my favorite! Last night however I had the Parmesan crusted chicken-cheesy GREATNESS! The asparagus is great! Good sized side salads! Fabulous stuffed mushrooms :) great staff and atmosphere! Yee-haw!"}
{"text":"Eat here somewhat regularly.  

Food is normally very good. 

Service varies between pretty good and very good. 

We had dinner here last night.  Good service. Most of the food was great.  Unfortunately, my steak was a bit on the tough side.  Didn't complain, cause it was seasoned perfectly and their steaks are usually very tender.  

One downside - there we're a couple of screaming kids present for most of our meal.  No one from the restaurant said anything to the parents. I realize this can be an awkward situation for the restaurant management, but I think everyone deserves a pleasant dining experience (not just parents). 

It 'seems' parents are often content to sit and let their kids scream at the top of their lungs.  ...sigh..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat here once a week. Great food staff and the place is clean. 5 star because there is nothing negative that you can say."}
{"text":"Delicious! First time here and can't wait to go back.  I had the ribeye with mashed potatoes.  It was cooked a perfect medium and melted in my mouth!  If I wasn't in public, I would have licked my plate!"}
{"text":"First time trying after my husband had tried one at another location for a lunch meeting. He was bummed to find out you can't order the lunch for dinner. Even though they serve sandwiches for dinner and lunch. 
My burger (should have been simple) was rare when it came out. Now i'm not a picky eatter but when my burger is nothing but Red-Pinkish on the inside, I'm n Not what I ordered at all. They took it back and while my husband ate dinner I sat there, so it didn't get cold. When he was done my burger came back - same one, cooked a little better. But there's just something about getting the same one and seeing it rare that you aren't hungry anymore. I picked the good pieces off of it. And I ate while my husband sat and watched me. 
Manager even was making his rounds and saw me waiting - just asked if I had something coming out. 
Waiter was nice and efficient but my frustration was we didn't get ANYTHING for the inconvenience. Not half off or a coupon for an appetizer next time. No free dessert. Not even $2 off. Something would have been a nice gesture to get us to walk thru that door again."}
{"text":"Steak was over cooked and dry!  I could not eat it.  Husband and son liked their meals (all steak) but I think for the cost you could save bucks and go to Texas Roadhouse down the road.  It is a beautiful restaurant and our server was excellent.  I think it is too expensive for the area.  After tip it was about $80 for 3 for lunch/early dinner.  Probably will not go back because I can get just as good for less elsewhere.  Go if you want atmosphere."}
{"text":"Erica our server was very awesome and attentive. She is so far the only waitress we have ever had that was able to keep up with my husbands water intake. The manager walked around to the tables and really talked and cared about what the people had to say. We got their 2 for 25 deal with calamari, sirloin with mashed potatoes, Parmesan chicken with Mac and cheese and the apple goldrush for dessert. Everything was outstanding! The steak was prepared correctly and extremely tender for a sirloin. Just a warning everything is pretty salty which I like but maybe you don't."}
{"text":"get the 12.99 deal. watch out for crazy people. sat down with me on way out, looking for a date?"}
{"text":"Shrimp appetizer is great. French Onion Soup yummy. Salads looked and tasted wonderful. 
Chili is a big disappointment. 
Nine girls out for a birthday lunch. Fun. 
Our wait staff were awesome"}
{"text":"There are some significant changes since my last review of Longhorn.  Although their food quality is still very good ( fresh meat & vegetables ) I recognize the PORTIONS HAVE GOTTEN NOTICEABLY SMALLER.  We used to have left overs for doggie bags for next day lunch and possibly dinner.  Also, entree prices have slightly increased.  Smaller portions + higher prices certainly affect VALUE.  

Whereas before I considered Longhorn a great value . . . NOW ITS A SPLURGE.  We used to dine at LH 5-6 a month; lately its down to 1-2 a month because of VALUE.

* * * 3 1/2 STARS * * *"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Never going back ever. Rude and disrespectful bartender.  One star is more than generous."}
{"text":"We went here because my wife and I were craving surf and turf. Service was excellent. Short 10 minute wait. Cocktails were a bit pricey. We both had fillet mignon and lobster. Fillet was excellent, lobster was a bit small and and gooey. That's why I gave a 4 star rating. Price of meal was $28/ea. which was reasonable for what we had. I would definitely eat here again, but would skip the lobster."}
{"text":"It was busier than I thought it would be for a Sunday morning, but we never felt neglected.  Our server, Damon, was very good and the food was top notch."}
{"text":"I was there last Wednesday, and it was awesome!  My date and I ordered the salmon for her and prime rib for me.  Both were cooked perfectly.  Mike, our waiter, was very attentive and upbeat.  He treated us like we were in a 5 star restaurant, and we got 5 star food to match the service.  My date was a little picky with the order, but Mike made sure everything was timely and right.  Great place to take anyone, but perfect price and quality combo for a date!"}
{"text":"My friend placed an order for us around 9:30 for pickup. Considering they were scheduled to close at 10:00, I was surprised they took our order,  but the man that took it was very curt, telling us we would \"be there at 10:00\". We sped to get there in time and arrived at 10:01, but the man locking the door did let us in. We waited about 5 minutes, the bartender made my friend a drink and then we left. Once we arrived home, my friend was disappointed to find that:
1) he had received a very small portion of parmesan crusted asparagus-maybe 7 stalks total, 
2)he were told we were ordering 6 oz steaks; they appeared closer to 4 oz than 6 oz, and
3)we requested chicken bites and cheese fries, both of these items were spicy-too spicy for my boyfriend to eat. 
These were a bit irritating, but the three of us ignored it as the food was still delicious. However, when I grab the butter and sour cream I requested,
4)I found that they put sour cream in the same to go container as one of the butter containers, which they gave me three for one baked potato.
In short, it was good food, but terrible service. I'd suggest a different location."}
{"text":"GROSS. WASTE OF MONEY. It's worth it to pay a little more and go to arrowhead grill or Flemmings. I ordered the parmesan chicken. My chicken was undercooked and smothered in thick pasty sauce. I didn't want to be dying on the toilet the next day, so after one look at my plate and 2 bites, I gave up and bailed. My husband ordered the steak, and he said it was one of the worst he has ever had. All the side dishes were nasty. $50.00 bill for disgusting food that we couldn't even muster enough courage to eat. We left with our plates full of food."}
{"text":"Dont come!!! Waiter made several mistakes. Waited a long time even it's after 830. The worst of all is the steak itself...."}
{"text":"Great steaks, service, decor, ambiance, and large servings at a reasonable price!!  Love it there!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this location on Saturday 3/7/2015. I wasn't planning on spending 15 dollars for lunch but my friend ordered a steak so I did. I had a great lunch tender great flavor salad dressing was good and the service was great. Will go back and will tell people.

{"text":"What a great meal! The steak was juicy and tender, cooked just right (MED RARE).  Our server Tracy was pleasant, professional and attentive.  We will certainly. come back."}
{"text":"Usually the steaks are prepared correctly. When they are they're delicious.

A lot depends on the server you get. Whenever we visit we ask for LeeAnn.  She's friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. When she suggests an item to try, try it.  When she's our server our experience is always good."}
{"text":"I have been coming here at least 3 times a week since July and always order at the bar. The staff is excellent and Never disappoints. I do not remember  all the Wonderful lady server however I do remember  Dominic. This gentlerman's service with a smile warrants a second visit by itself!!"}
{"text":"It was yummy! Had the ribeye, gratin potatoes, apple cider ribs, sweet potato and the brownie desert. Loved it!

Ask for Stephanie's section if you have kids. She was great with our 5yo son. (And with us too). Thanks Stephanie!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to impress me, so when I say don't walk, run to the LongHorn, I mean it! Great food and fabulous service."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was extremely slow. My friend and I arrived at 5:40 with our children. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. We waited 5-10 minutes before a server came to our table to take our drink order. The server that took our drink order informed us that our server was very busy and he was helping him out. We also gave an appetizer order to this server when he returned with our drinks. At 6:15 our appetizer finally arrived and was delivered by our actual server (who didn't even bother to introduce himself or apologize for not being at our table earlier). We ordered our food and it was delivered by another server. Our server eventually checked in to see how our food was. The manager checked in with our table and we mistakenly said everything was fine (giving our server the benefit of the doubt that he was busy). We finished our meals and wait at least 10 minutes before flagging down another server for a box and our check. Our server finally showed up and gave us our check. We requested a coupon be taken off the check and our checks split - th is process seemed to take awhile. Finally we had our checks and we're ready to pay, suddenly our server was right on top of things ready to accept our payment (at this point the restaurant was actually busy).  Asked to see the manager on the way out to share our experience.  Began my conversation wi th him by saying \"I really should have said some thing to you earlier when you stopped by our table\".  He half apologized, made a point to say \"you should have said something earlier) and said he would talk to the server.  Overall I was very disappointed in the service and the managers response."}

{"text":"This is the all new Longhorn rebuilt from the fire that destroyed the original building.  Honestly I think it was the best thing that ever happened to this location.  The atmosphere is top notch and more modern - much better than before.  I think I'll be visiting this Longhorn more now since it's been redone and it's more customer friendly.  The staff was very friendly and helpful as we were there for my dad's birthday and they were happy to bring us additional plates and silverware for the cake.  Go visit their \"new\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Easily accommodated our large group of 15 including three children. We were seated immediately. They have a large round table, that can seat about 10. We had a few too many so had a few regular tables joined with a smaller round table. 

The kids menu includes a steak option and parents can substitute fruit or veggies instead of fries. Serving size for the kids meals are rather large. 

Adult beverages are a good size, depending on the drink, you can refill from the shaker. The price seems reasonable and generally fall into the range $6-9.

Food was good and good portion sizes.

They service was a bit uncoordinated and food came out staggered. I received my salad after everyone else had finished theirs. One person did not get their meal; it was taken off of the check. It was a little ones birthday and we had to ask for their birthday sundae three times. The servers were pleasant, but they missed a few things."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this restaurant We waited an hour for an appetizer to come out,  what's really embarrassing is that no manager came over to offer an apology or explanation we had to ask twice to speak with somebody. The manager explained that several of the kitchen staff had quit in the middle of a shift and there's basically nobody back there to do anything. 

gave this place another shot yesterday, grabbed a seat at the bar, no good beer however The steak was awesome, but The desserts were freezer burnt. I would be extremely embarrassed to be the manager of this establishment."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this restaurant during dinner hours the parking lot is full and until now, I have not had a chance to eat here for dinner since it opened. I had already reviewed the menu online and had a good sense of what was offered and the selection I would make. Since the restaurant is so busy in the evenings the call ahead wait list for seating turned out to be very useful and my wife and I only had to wait about a minute before we were seated.

Once seated we were greeted by our server who was welcoming and quick to get drink orders along with bringing the complimentary bread and whipped butter. I ordered the New York Strip meal which came with one side, and a small dinner salad. The steak was cooked as I requested and was seared nicely. I was happy enough with the side order which was their loaded baked potato. My wife ordered the sirloin steak that comes with two grilled shrimp skewers, a side and salad. She was pleased with her steak and I was able to try the shrimp which were grilled nicely and tasted great.

After nearly finishing our meal, the manager came by our table to ask us about our dinner experience. We appreciate that the manager took the time and takes an active role in ensuring the satisfaction of the restaurant's customers.

We plan on trying again in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here for over half an hour for a bowl of soup. Two very large tables also here waiting to be served. Bread is delicious but not what I wanted for dinner. 

Poor form.

One and a half hours later...
Soup is hot and good. 
Steak at table is hot, a little fatty, but good. Mushrooms ordered did not come out and broccoli was cold. 

Sticking with one star. I hope this was a one time thing for these guys. The waitress was kind."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and from the minute we walked in I liked it. The hostess was friendly and pleasant, the decor was desirable and we got seated right away (Monday evening). We ordered the Cheese stuffed mushrooms which were delish (which says a lot since I'm not a huge fan of cheese) the Outlaw Ribeye medium-well, baked potato and a salad for sides and the were all absolutely perfect. Now the reason for only giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5. I'm not sure if our waiter (a young man) was having a bad day but when he approached our table he never mentioned his name, which I've never experienced from a server. He was not very personable and acted like we weren't the type of diners he really wanted to be bothered with. When we were done with our meal he never offered dessert and just bought us a \"to go\" container and the check. I really wanted dessert but didn't say anything and just paid and left. We'll be back but I have to admit that if he is going to be our server again I'm going to have to ask for a different table/server."}
{"text":"The food is great however when picking up to go, it's kind of a pain. You have to go to the bar which is usually busy and wait until you can get someone's attention. When I came I finally got someone's attention after 5 min only to be told someone else does the to go orders and she will go find him. Took over 5 more min for him to come however he served the people sitting at the bar before me. Not sure we will order to go again."}
{"text":"This is the best place to have a steak!!!! It's been years since I've had a steak I could brag about. I can't wait to come here again the service was awesome too."}
{"text":"Longhorn for Steak burgers and great conversation with friends.  Wait time for the food is about 20 minutes during the lunch period. My husband had a Steak & Bacon Melt with garlic fries.  All of the food was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!
Dining room was full, so we went to the bar, which is normal for us.  Bartender ignored us for a while, never smiled, and NEVER wiped the bar down, and we sat down right after another couple just vacated!
Finally asked us what we wanted to drink. Gave him the order and requested menus.
He brought both, so decided we bet ter order while we had his attention!

Wine glasses arrived, then salads...so we quickly asked for a bar rag...he brought one and wiped \"around\" our food.....ICK!

Caesar salads were good. Wine fine. 
Broccoli, baker loaded all fine.  
Ribs, although tender, had mediocre flavor, too many bone chards, mediocre sauce.  Skewered shrimp were sooo salty, and husband likes salt...but these were OVER salted!

This bartender was so preoccupied with the cash drawer, he had little time for anything else.  Occasionally another male server and female server would come to see what was up and they discussed...? Why not handle that AFTER HOURS, NOT peak dinner hour?

This chain needs SERIOUS ATTENTIVE MANAGEMENT!  Attention to detail on menu and at each location regarding better service.
Mediocre food and service will just not .make it in the long run

We won't return."}
{"text":"When you arrive, ask for Ms Ashton, a server there. 
The interior was very \"western\"!  The hostess was very pleasant.   

The place was full of meat-eating predictors!  Good company. 

I ordered 16oz Prime Rib w/baked potato and side salad.  Wife ordered 6oz Sirloin w French onion soup, rice pilaf and side salad.    The fresh bread served tasted good.  

In short, no complaints with the food-very satisfied!

Our server Ashton was patient and never sounded rushed.  My wife is small with an accent and Ashton kneeled down near her to listen attentively.  I was touched by this. 

I gave her a 20% tip-she rated it.   She said she had worked there for over 2 years.  Since e were from out of town, we asked her for sightseeing suggestions and she was a great help.  

Next time we come to Phoenix, we're going again. 

Enjoy!"}

The waiting was reasonable for a Friday night 25 min
The kids menu was creative in which I did not notice any voice from my kids they were busy with it that is awsum
The steak come with side and salad and the price is perfect for such combination with such quality that you get 
It was cooked as I want med well with pink line in the middle 
There was no more space for any dessert, otherwise I would try the pumpkin spice lava cake.
The kids enjoy there dinner too and we all were so happy with our servant"}

We will be back soon."}

{"text":"I got a gift card for Christmas for this place. Never even heard of it before but I also don't eat at a lot of chain restaurants either. I went New Year's Eve to try it out. I am a single guy and the place was super busy so I chose a seat at the bar. The bar was busy but started to clear as soon as I sat down. It became very apparent very quickly that there was a single person working the bar. She was also the one making drinks for the rest of the restaurant. New Year's Eve is typically a drinking holiday so the short staffing was perplexing. After my area was cleared she asked for my drink order and I requested a menu. It was close to 10 minutes before the bartender asked for my order. I order the filet and lobster tail.  About 10 minutes later, a young lady delivered my entree to me; however, I had not received my salad yet. I sent it back and my salad was delivered about 2 minutes later. I was never offered bread so I asked a young man cleaning glasses at the bar if I could have some bread. He quickly returned with a loaf. The bleu cheese dressing is too sweet and was really heavy on the salad. When the entree arrived it looked fine but I did ask the server if it was a fresh meal or left over from the first delivery. The filet was very good, the risotto was fine, and the lobster tail was cooked fine too. It is a little small and the seasoning on it could be left off. Overall the meal was average to decent but the service was horrible. I never was asked how the meal tasted or apologized to for the mishap. I understand the busy-ness that was going on, but it had died down quite a bit by the time I sat down. As a single person who also doesn't drink alcohol, I am accustomed to not always getting doted on by servers since my tab may not always generate the biggest tips. But even just a little acknowledgment to me would've gone a long way. Then to my surprise, as I looked at my bill, I was discounted 25%. I am assuming it was for the messed up order?? But no one said anything to me about that either. Well, I am grateful for the attempt to make up for it, but not sure I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Needs improvement.  The food was pretty good but it's clearly a new store.  We called ahead for reservations that morning, when we arrived we were told it would be 30 minutes, but we waited 55 minutes, the same as those without a reservation.  When they did seat our group of nine, they asked to put us in a booth that wasn't made to fit a group our size.  Shorted silverware, not given plates for bread, the onion chips had skin on them, found large sharp piece of plastic in ice cream.  Server was kind and attentive.  Oh, and the booth we sat in had huuuuge lumps or uneven sections, I felt like I was riding a wooden camel."}
{"text":"After making this post the GM of the LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant  as well as a district manger from Darden both contacted me,they both said they were aware of and were working on the problem,as I spoke to them I could tell they were both sincerely upset about my problems at this location..At this point I believe their is a true concern to improve the service and that the location is going through growing pains (only 5ish months old)...I believe they deserve another chance and will give the location a try in several weeks.

The General Manager Claudia struck me as a straight shooter (said today was the first time she was made aware of my issue) that is truly committed to making her restaurant a first class,service first establishment,and for that she and the restaurant deserve a second chance...



****************************************************************************************
First Review::::::::::

The wait staff was condescending and just plain RUDE,on a party of 9 we had 2 waitresses and not one order came correct ,4:30 on Sunday only 3 or 4 tables in the whole house filled and they couldn't get right,what happens when they get rushed.
The worst part of the service was they made us feel like the problems with the food was our fault and when they replaced the items (which in a couple of cases were still wrong) they almost threw them at you with no apology..
BY FAR THE WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE BEEN IN IN MY LIFE!!!

Also talked to the Manager on duty the next day (cooled off about service by then) to let them know what happened.He was very nice and said he would have the General Manager contact me about the problems I've not heard a word,(almost 2 weeks now) .

With service like this at the prices they charge I would expect this location to be an empty building soon. 

Restaurants like this one give the Darden Brand a very bad reputation and the Corporate headquarters need to get these rouges under control to save their Brand"}
{"text":"So, a friend from Ohio told me that the beef here was pretty good, and I made the dreadful mistake of actually believing him. 

Despite it being a Saturday night, we were seated without any wait time, which should have told me something :/

My friend is born and raised in Ohio, whereas I am from California. In any case, we were discussing just how awesome California is when our server arrived at our table to take our orders. He overhears our discussion of California and proceeds to chime in: \"I don't like California. Too many Spanish people.\" Hmmm...

BIGOT MUCH???

Anyway, I ordered a prime rib, cooked MEDIUM (pink on the inside). These ethnocentric oafs must have thought I was an idiot Asian who has never eaten steak, because they ended up bringing me an OUTSIDE CUT, cooked MEDIUM WELL. EPIC FAIL.

My dining experience here was appalling on all levels, and I am in utter disgust over the quality of their food, their blatant disregard for the customer, and more importantly, the ethnocentrism. THIS PLACE SUCKS. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"LongHorn is probably my favorite Steakhouse in the area!   I have gone there many times and have always had a nice experience.  The restaurant is clean and the staff has always been friendly.  Everyone I have ever gone with has been very satisfied with the food and the prices are very reasonable.  Also, if you like margaritas, I personally think they make the best in the area.  They are very tasty and you basically get two for the price of one : )"}
{"text":"I thought it was a decent place. for the food and high wait time for serving food ,  prices were high  .service was decent . The person greeting us at the front did not look like the most pleasant person , maybe he was having a bad day. Cant say that I would like to go there again . if I don't have any place else better I may go there."}
{"text":"Okay I don't understand why so many people have to review this place so low. First of all, this is the Westside of Madison so we of course got the best service ever. My girlfriend and I also got some really good food. Probably the best food we have had in a long time and those steaks were so juicy. The cooks really know what they are doing when it comes to steak. It's like it melts in your mouth. Who would ever go there to order a burger there anyways?! It's a steakhouse! I wish I could give it more stars! Well-done(no pun intended), Thank You Longhorn Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and a great atmosphere. The waiters were delightful, and prompt."}
{"text":"The place is great. I had the fillet and was a great choice because tasted so delicious. The waiter was awesome and very polite. Service was fast and no long tame waiting. I will defined come back to this place. We where seated with in 5 min and everyone provided good service."}
{"text":"I recommend giving this place another try.  There are a number of negative reviews, and I am not sure why.  The food was great and the service was tremendous. My wife had the harvest mushroom filet which was cooked perfectly and very tender.   I had the prime rib which was again perfectly medium rare and well seasoned.   We also had the sampler appetizer which was better than average."}
{"text":"I have given this place three chances now and I don't plan on coming back. 

First trip, one my father in law found a hair in his food. Thankfully, they comped his meal.
Second trip, service was terrible! It took 30 minutes for them to bring our salads, none of which had the right dressings and another 45 minutes for our food, that was also not correct. The manager gave us all 50% off of our bill.
Third trip, service was extremely poor and the food was not good."}
{"text":"Have eaten there numerous times and do not like the way they cook their steaks. They taste like they have been baked in the oven, No grill marks, no char and dry on the inside. Asked the waitress how they were cooked and she said they were cooked on a flat grill to keep the juice in and if you wanted them cooked on a open flame it was by request. With the meat not being seared on the outside the juice and the flavor are lost. Will probably not have steak there again but I do like the salmon. It is really good."}
{"text":"If you like your meat smothered in salt you will like this place. 

If you REALLY like your meat smothered in salt you will REALLY like this place.

If you send your meal back because it is too salty, don't be surprised if it re-emerges only slightly less salty.

Recommendations:

 If corporate policy is to salt the bejeebers out everything, warn customers up front and give them the option.

 If something is sent back to the kitchen because it is too salty TAKE THE HINT. Lay off completely and let the customer season his/her food.

 Lastly, seasoning salt is for amateurs. If I want seasoning salt on my fries I will go over to Outback. I had much higher expectations of Longhorn."}
{"text":"Really love Charles.  We've been coming here for over 10 years!  The food is good and service is as expected!"}
{"text":"Called ahead, was told that I could put my name on a call ahead list.  Was quoted a 20 minute wait time.  Arrived 15 minutes later, only to be told it would be another 35-45 minute wait... They had a large number of people arrive.  I smell a scam....."}
{"text":"Really long wait!!! Finally the waiter came and tried to make up for it, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. First time. New building. Very nice. Modern and tasteful while not being too cheezy cowboy like so many steakhouses. Not crowded at all.
Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She did everything right -- Kept drinks full without asking, asked us how our food was shorty after serving, kept the bread basket full.

We were served in a reasonable amount of time. I had the sirloin. It was cooked to perfection with a nice sear and exactly medium doneness. It was tender and flavorful. My wife had the chicken salad. She liked the dressing which seemed hand made. Lots of ingredients.

Everything was perfect until we got the check which seemed more than we expected. It was for someone else's order! She was gracious and apologetic and remade the check. No harm no fowl.

Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this restaurant. Three staff is professional, friendly  without being over bearing.  The steak is superb, always cook to perfection.  I would highly recommend  this place to everyone.  Even the chicken wings is great.  Highest rating from me."}
{"text":"Went for dinner awhile back. Everything great. Went for lunch yesterday. Dismal. Nice people but no one at hosts desk when we came In or when we left. Couldnt get take out. No one there. Anyway appetizers were good: corn cakes ...fried asparagus...chicken planks. Good fresh bread. Lunch plate had a few chips that were ok. The chowder (shrimp & lobster) was more a bland potato soup. My hamburger was burnt--took it to my dog--my kids wouldn't eat it. The bourbon pecan pie was good but mostly like plain old pecan pie. Think i'm finished with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his 35th Birthday. We ordered Calamari for an appetizer we were completely disappointed, it was rubbery and the sauce was overpowering with sweetness and made everything mushy. It was obviously frozen. Their Ginger Alcoholic beverage was disgusting, too much ginger. One thing I can positively say is that the Prime Rib was out of this world!!! I highly recommend the Prime Rib to anyone who's looking for a good quality dinner!"}
{"text":"Service was great from the moment we walked in the door.  Food was great.  Everyone was friendly and really made us feel welcome. Jonathan is an excellent server. 

Great experience overall. :)"}
{"text":"The way all restaurants should be! Top notch, excellent food and AMAZING service.       This might be my favorite ever.  I love the atmosphere and I adore the way the waiting staff is so kind and friendly and respectful.   I'm serious they are so nice.    

Yes it's a bit pricey but it's so worth it. The food is amazing .  Great steaks and sides.     Couldn't recommend this more.     

I always feel happy when I come here.  Love the setup love the general feel and always look forward to next visit.   And this is very rare for me.    I would give six stars if I could.      I've never seen such polite waiters before in my life.   Theyre not passive aggressive and visibly annoyed like most.    

Other restaurants could learn from their professionalism.    I would go here over outback or texasroadhouse any day!  No comparison."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Monroe.  Great food and even better service.

Every time we go there we are greeted warmly at the front door.  Then every server we've had is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  Love the \"peak seasons\" part of the menu that changes with the seasons."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Longhorn Steakhouse.  We had about a 30 minute wait but were able to get drinks in the bar while visiting with two very funny and friendly bartenders.  Our server, Manuel G., was very professional, polite, attentive, and friendly!  The fried green tomatoes were also a first, delicious!  Our steaks (ribeye & porterhouse) were cooked as requested and very yummy. Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"We went on a sunday evening and were seated in about 5 minutes.  Hostess and waitress were nice and friendly. We atarted out with wings for our appetizer. They were meaty with a tasty mild seasoning along with a side of buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese. For our main dish, our party ordered two burgers with fries and a chopped steak with baked sweet potato. 

Everything was cooked perfectly! Even the fries and bread were nice and hot when they were served.  Our waitress was attentive the entire evening. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Steaks over cooked. Fish drowning in butter. Out of French fries and we were here for a kids birthday. Waited for check longer than needed. Don't come here. Zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"My family and I used to love Longhorn. However at our recent visit on February 24.2012 the service, drinks and food were awful! We should have left within the first 15 minutes when our drinks and order were not taken...and the restaurant was NOT busy for a Friday night at 7:00. My husband and I ordered the chicken with stuffed portabello...needless to say the chicken was not cooked fully and the portabello was the size of a quarter. We will NOT go back. This was the second time we have visited and the chicken was not cooked properly. This restaurant needs to close it's doors."}
{"text":"Love Long Horn in other locations----this Waterfront location is AWFUL and has gone DOWNHILL !!!! After our most recent visit while doing some X-mas shopping, I can assure you that I will continue to visit their N. Hills location but the Waterfront needs a clean sweep of their awful cooks who can't season a steak properly....Their ignorant and rude people at the hostess desk, and possibly the worst service I've ever received in a restaurant.....So let me say this again, Love Long Horn----But not this God Awful location, which Mgt is obviously to blame"}
{"text":"Ate there today....very dissatisfied... had the porterhouse not cooked correctly 2 times TWO TIMES....I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse...the \"waiter\" brought the drinks to our table with them underneath his armpit...2 of the drinks that we consequently didn't touch because of so....the waiter also took it upon himself to hit on my wife right in front of me...this was supposed to be a special time...anniversary and it was absolutely dreadful. We will never return to this business ever again"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while, probably around 10 visits in the last 6 months and we have yet to have a bad experience. First tip, ask for Denise, she is the best server we have ever had. She recognized us from our previous visit because my girlfriend had gotten up to hold a door for an elderly gentleman as he was leaving. Since then she has stopped by just to talk to us and ask how we were doing ( even when she isn't our server ). Food is always great, I've had a few small issues like an over cooked steak (my order is a little tough to get right) but they always take care of it and make sure it's perfect. No complaints at all, great place and it's our go-to when we don't feel like trying something new."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her mom,  and I ate at LongHorn in Champaign tonight.  Our server, Adam was awesome! Best service we've experienced in quite some time."}
{"text":"I really love this place! The food is very good, atmosphere is upbeat, and always great service! Visited tonight and our serve, Jordan, did a fantastic job! She was very friendly and didn't make us feel rushed. She was always really nice to our 14mo daughter. The salmon was delicious and the warm cinnamon carrot cake might be the best dessert I've ever had! We will definitely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"The food was great, but it took forever for it to come out! We waited 30 minutes for it from the time or server took our order to the time the food came out. We watched an older couple leave because their food was taking so long and we almost left but as soon as we all agreed to leave our food came out.  She also took a long time to give us our check. She was very rude too. She asked my brother if he wanted his water refilled and he said no and she acted like he was a complete idiot until he agreed to have a refill and she said \"you can always dump it on your head.\" I mean, who the he'll says that to a customer amd treats them that way?! She also kept commenting about my service dog even though he was behaving perfectly. She also made comments on our order when we were ordering our food. Definitely not planning on coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"What a TERRIBLE experience we decided to try Longhorn instead of our favorite TEXAS ROADHOUSE and the service was terrible the steak was hard as a rock they attempted to re cook another one for me and 20 minutes later it comes out after the others had finished their meal the MANAGER offered apologies then never came back to check on me until it was too late WILL NEVER BE BACK 
It would be nice if the MANAGER would have taken care of entire bill instead of $10 off coupons for my next visit !!! Really coupons ??? How about CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! Stay away from this place overpriced overlooked"}
{"text":"Great food & the servers were so friendly. Pleasure to dine there."}
{"text":"Delicious, wings. None better anywhere. Perfectly cooked prime rib with creamy and amazing crusted mac and cheese. Parmesan crusted chicken was to die for...you better love cheese. Their house bread and butter is warm and soft. No complaints and we will drive 120 miles again, just for this. Kristina is a phenomenal server and everything she suggested was a huge winner."}
{"text":"Good food. The steak is usually cooked how you ask for it.  I dont like that you have to go to the bar to get take out food."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter went on Valentine's Day night it was super busy but the wait was worth it I had the filet and my daughter had the the ribeye and both were cooked to perfection and the staff was really good I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"For this place being a chain restaurant I'm really surprised.  We go here every chance we possibly can (1 - 3x per month) since we have never been disappointed. I have a 3 month old that is breastfed and of course sometimes children are unpredictable and in the middle of dinner they seem to always want to eat. I am not one of those mothers that will feed at a dinner table and was very leary on taking her to the bathroom to feed. But since I didn't have much more of a choice I went to the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and also had a chair in the family changing/handy-cap bathroom, which was definitely a added bonus to the great food!"}
{"text":"Over recent years,  I've had good luck with the Longhorn chain. Not so, of late. When traveling frequently, it's a comfort to know some restaurants will be, day in and day out, a place to get a good meal. Longhorn is becoming more and more hit and miss. This was a miss. I had only 45 minutes for a mid-afternoon lunch. Although service was attentive and friendly, the steak was 50% tough or just plain gristle. The waitress offered a replacement, but I'd run out of time. Fortunately, I'd eaten enough of the excellent rolls and iceberg lettuce salad to hold me until supper."}
{"text":"Food was great. 
Service was excellent. Marco was more than accommodating to our table and keep our drinks full. 
Ambiance was pleasantly mellow for a family establishment. 
Cost is worth what you are paying for. Remember this is not RuthChris, but a good substitute if you don't want that RuthChris Bill."}
{"text":"I have to say I like this place.  I have been there a couple times and once sat at a table, although there was a little wait it was enjoyable and food was really good.  The staff was great and friendly.  Another time I circumvented the wait and sat at the bar.  My meal was again good and this particular bartender (Sam) was great.  She was very personable and fun.  I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday dinner last night and the service was not as expected. We wanted to linger over an appetizer and drinks before ordering but our waitress insisted that we order our meals at the same time as the app. She came back three times to get our dinner order so we ordered but asked her not to bring out our meals until we had finished the shared appetizer. As we were eating the appetizer you guessed it. Our salads arrived and in a couple of minutes the steak and salmon entries were brought out. Our meals were cold. All in all we felt hurried and didn't enjoy the visit."}
{"text":"Not a good way to have a first visit go. We were seated and waited. It was finally the manager our drink and food order. We were never told who our server was. Ordered a medium steak and it was rare so I sent it back.  It came back a little better still never found out who server was manager had his name on ticket let him know this was our first and probably last time in. Such a shame since we need a good steak house in the area"}
{"text":"LongHorn is always consistent wherever you go. Just as good here as in Nashville! Flo's filet is such a great lean cut steak, the Rib Eye can't be beat for a chain restaurant. 

Staff was good but not anything over the top. Layout of the restaurant was very pleasant. Overall a really nice meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Best rib eye I've had in a very long time. Perfectly cooked medium rare and remembered to ask for no seasoning. Very flavorful. Hubby had filet and lobster tail with the special corn on the cob also perfectly cooked.  Service was outstanding without being intrusive. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"What a excellent place. Beautiful inside. We were sat immediately. Aaron W was waiter and was very helpful. The steaks were amazing. The manager Cedric stopped by to see how things were. He was funny and very talkative. We will be coming back and was told I can call ahead."}
{"text":"We went there last weekend. A party of 6 at 1pm. The restaurant was slow, but we had to wait almost 15 minutes for a table. When finally seated, it took our server forever to meet, greet and get our drink orders to us. They were severely short handed, but you shouldn't make it a guest problem to deal with.

My order came out wrong the first time. I ordered a soup and 1/2 roast beef sandwich. My first bite of the tiny sandwich was nothing but horseradish. I opened it up, and there was only 1 piece of beef on it. We spent just shy of 2 hours there for lunch. The service was entirely too slow.

Everyone else with my party enjoyed their meals, but the service time was too long. There's no excuse for that.

I probably will come back, and I hope that aspect improves."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. Went last night for dinner with friends. Picked Longhorns because of location and to do something casual after entertaining the family mob for Thanksgiving.

The place was packed with families thinking the same thing. Some really large parties, which looked to be overwhelming the wait staff. This was my third visit, but first time for dinner. First two visits were for lunch.

Bottom line on the steaks that both my wife and I ordered: Incredibly salty, almost to the point of being indelible. I absolutely hate that all these chain style restaurants over salt everything. I don't think this was a one off event. My lunch visits resulted in much the same, but to the same ridiculous level of saltiness.

Server was sweet, but won't be back."}
{"text":"I am giving them a 2 star only because I really enjoyed our first visit but last night we went for my birthday ( Which is today ) and it was horrible. I wanted to leave before our steaks even got there.

So we walk in, I called ahead ( Around 3 that afternoon) to let them know that we would be there around 7. She is walking us through the dinning room. I had asked to be sat at a booth. We walk by one booth.....two booths...and she takes us to this little booth in the back that is in between two large parties with kids. One party ( of 10 ) was literary less than 2 feet away, and they were both very loud. We should have asked to move but by the talk we had talked about it our \"waiter\" was already at our table. He starts by bringing us old ass bread THEN TELLS US HE KNOWS IT IS!! Its like...why the HELL would you bring out the bread knowing that we weren't going to eat it....it wasn't eatable....very hard. When He comes back with the bread and our drinks ( Soda ) We order our food. We got the Sweet Chili Calamari as an app. I got the filet and lobster tail with Mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the rib eye and fries. We had decided that we wanted to order drinks....Our app comes ( no sign of our waiter ) it is very very sweet ( just taste like honey also at this time my boyfriend needs a soda ) and had way too much sauce on it...we didn't eat it....15 mins later our salads come ( ceaser salad, very good) I have at this point seen our waiter walking around going to other tables and even look at me and making eye contact and STILL not coming to our table....20 MINS after we FINISH our salads our food decides to come out.After our food comes out our waiter decides to ask us how things are. My boyfriends says he needs a soda and we are too pissed off to care to order drinks. My steak and lobster tail were what you can expect. Cooked correct and tasted alright....I will say that they do need to cut back on the cheese in their mac and cheese because it is way to strong and there is way to much. My boyfriend said that his food was good. Well at this point we are eating and the staff there decides this is the perfect time for them to clean up the table and area that was less then 2 feet from us.....It awesome to have someone vacuuming a foot away from you with their ass in your face while you are trying to eat.....soooo we were ready to go...my boyfriend got a to go box for his steak and paid the bill and we left....we will not be going back and we will be calling to complain. Thanks for ruining my birthday dinner longhorn."}
{"text":"Wonderful filet, so tender I could have cut it with a butter knife. Fiance thought his bone in ribeye was amazing. Our favorite steak place by far"}
{"text":"Salad was very fresh, steaks were savory, staff was courteous  and attentive.  Overall a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"My first visit turned out very nice. I had steak and lobster. I asked for no seasoning on my steak and that was done. It was juicy and cooked perfectly. 
I truly enjoyed the quiet surroundings.  That other steakhouse is just to loud for me. We never felt rushed or bothered. 
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I recently had an excellent experience here!
I went here with my husband, my cousin and his wife.
The restaurant had a Western Theme.
They had a good selection of steaks. The cook prepared our steaks exactly how we ordered them.
Our waitress was very polite. I liked that she hit a good balance of keeping our glasses of
 drinks full but not being pushy. 
It was a good place to have great conversation and decent food!
I definitely liked the service that we received. Everybody from the hostess, the waitress, and any other employees who we met were very positive and helpful people!
We definitely chose the right restaurant when we chose this one!
Overall it was a very positive experience!
I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. I called in about 3 hours before and they said I could do a call ahead, assuming they would reserve a spot for me I wasn't too sure what it was but they took my name and time down. When I got there it was PACKED and the host told me it would be an hour wait, despite my call ahead? So I just stood there and then another hostess told me it would be 30-45 min. Fine whatever I would wait, I didn't mind too much I was just confused because they even pulled up my call ahead that was at 6:30. They give me a buzzer and I wait. 

10 min. later maybe less, they call me to my table!! Amazing service. Maybe it was by luck but I was very impressed. Our server was great too we loved her! I think her name was Alison or Alina or Alysha? Something with an A. (Pretty gal, Medium length light brown hair) 

Anyways! Service was amazing. Food was good. I'd be back"}
{"text":"Salad gave me food poisoning and when called them to notify them, they blew it off.  Haven't been there since."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great dinner, I had the surf and turf prime rib with lobster tail the steak and lobster were cooked to perfection, My wife had the The red rock grilled shrimp over rice, there were three skewers consisting of four shrimp per skewer for a total of 12 shrimp much too much for her, brought the rest home and also was cooked to perfection and tasted great.
Asten P and her server in training were just the friendliest people you can meet. It was our 53th anniversary and were surprised to get molten lava cake with a scoop of ice cream for free."}
{"text":"They have good food and have showed a big improvement since they opened. They have appetizers that I like. At first the service was very slow, but since they opened this has vastly improved. They seemed to have retrained everyone. The price is a little higher than other restaurants in the area, but they have items on the menu that other steak houses don't have. If you have not tried them, give it a shot, you may like it. I will be back again."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night.  Wait staff friendly and my steak was the best I have had in years.  We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I'll admit I was not a fan of Longhorn before this place opened.  I had visited other Longhorns, and it was always kind of a yawn.
My wife and I have been to this location several times now, though, and with one exception, the food and service has been spot-on.
The one exception was the prime rib sandwich, which I will never order again.  Full of fatty, grisly meat.  Yuck.
The bread, soups, and burgers are great, though."}
{"text":"I've heard people knock this place and I just don't get it. They have great food and great management that is always in the floor helping and greeting customers. Here's my advice if you want a good time here...

When you get in place you reservation for how many people. If you have say two or four then try to find a spot at the bar to sit and wait. This really makes the time fly by. If bigger go outside and wait. You'll be miserable sitting in their little waiting area. 

When you sit down order steak! It's a steakhouse so let them feed you what they serve best. If you're a drinker order a short glass of beer. It's cold but I feel their tall beers I can never finish because they get warm. Bread is excellent and sides are delicious. Steak is always phenomenal. 

I think people come here expecting a fancy top notch steakhouse but you can't expect that from here. But I am very pleased, and full when I got there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in what used to be a great place to dine.
Their portions have dwindled from very large portions to at times, 1/3 of what they used to be and their meat now appears to be of a lesser quality but their prices have remained the same. LongHorn Steakhouse used to have some of the most tasty lamb chops and ribs but the last two visits proved to be very disappointing. 
We hope that their attempt to save money by passing on lower quality food and service will soon be turned around as we used to very much enjoy dining here.
Thank you..."}
{"text":"Good food , good ambience.  Waiter was very polite  . Excellent service. Salmon was awesome well cooked. We will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"We've been to a few steakhouses in the area, and this place beat them all hands down. Granted, it's a chain. The décor is what one would expect from a Texan steak joint. Tables are a generous size, which is helpful. Our waitress was pleasant, speedy, without being obtrusive.

The steaks were to die for and were prepared exactly as ordered. My Renegade was very tasty. Our whole party was very pleased, especially since the prices are comparable to other places with mediocre food. I especially enjoyed the Montana Mule (like the Moscow Mule, but with Jack). Won't be bothering to give the Outback any more attempts to win me over. This will be the go to place for steaks at a mid level price point."}
{"text":"Wednesday. 11:25 am.

We were seated immediately as we were one of the first to arrive. Their greeter was very pleasant. Our server, Tara, was very friendly and knowledgeable. We were served their honey wheat loaf which was warm from the oven and very tasty. The Caesar's Salad was a bit soggy and lacked the desired crunchiness. We ordered the shrimp lobster chowder which was so delicious and creamy and having a little spicy was to it. We then dug into the Medium 14 oz New York Strip Steak which was heavily seasoned and grilled perfectly. We dared not diminish the steak's flavor by using steak sauce and such. Overall, a pleasant dining experience. Thanks Tara."}
{"text":"I wasn't prepared for this! The food was really good ( had the Napa grilled chicken- delicious!!), the service was fast ( it was a Wednesday night) and we had a good time with the waitress who was really friendly and had us crack in' up!"}
{"text":"Went with friends for dinner. Swordfish was very good according to my friend. My guy had the chopped sirloin which he said was good. I had the small sirloin. It was cooked as I asked, medium rare but it was on the tough side"}
{"text":"Total meh-fest... 

Never really heard much about longhorn so I decided to give it a try for our date night on Friday night (1/2/15). 

The service was OK. They never brought bread out to our table. My wife ordered the broil and I ordered the NY Strip, both medium rare. The server warned us ahead that they tend to \"overseason\" their steaks, we were both fine with that. Steaks came out, both over-cooked, and not seasoned at all. Not too big of an issue, however, for the $20 I'm paying for a NY Strip, I'd imagine it cooked a little similar to an ACTUAL steakhouse. These steaks tasted like the exact type of quality I can get at Denny's, where the expectation of quality is a lot less. When I dine at a place that calls themselves a steakhouse, my expectation is that the quality closely resembles that. 

I could have purchased the same cuts from a butcher, and cooked myself, for around $15-$20 dollars and would have tasted a lot better. I understand I'm paying for labor, but it seemed like very unskilled labor I payed premium pricing for. I am very experienced in this field and would have offered to go in the kitchen and teach the cook how to REALLY cook a steak, but it was close to closing and I'm sure they wanted to leave. Although, I AM available to teach some tips and techniques if they ever need. 

To be honest, I probably won't come back. The service was OK. Average. Nothing that blew my socks off. But the quality of the steaks versus the price I paid for them was not worth it. I'd rather pay a higher premium and know I'm getting top quality product by a chef who's experienced and knows how to cook them."}
{"text":"I just had the sweet corn fritters, strawberry and pecan salad, baked sweet potato and 6 oz filet. The steak was like cutting through butter. The service was great too. This place has been consistently good every time we've been here."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I wrote a review regarding a very negative experience my husband and I had at this establishment.  I was contacted by Richard and he was extremely courteous and pleasant to speak with.  We went over what had happened and he said he would love to invite us back and send us a gift certificate via postal service.  I gave him my work address to ensure someone could sign for it.  About 40 minutes later I was asked for at the front desk.  Mr. Richard took the time out of his day to hand deliver the envelope to me. While I do not work far from the restaurant,  I am highly impressed.  When a business shows an interest in their client,  no matter how big or small they will thrive, and I am more than willing to give my business to one such as this.   I am looking forward to my next visit in the near future."}
{"text":"We stayed in the area this past August weekend. After the drive and checking into the hotel we popped in here for a late lunch. To our collective memories we were unable to recall ever eating at a Longhorn until Friday 8/21. 

Neither of had steak. I had the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the combo was. Four nice-sized slices resting on a bed of mixed greens. A nice combo all around.

For the main meal I has the beefsteak tomato salad and chicken tortilla soup. Not much chicken or tortilla in the soup, but still tasty. The salad was delish, and those than know me are aware of that I am a meat dude, but left very satisfied today."}
{"text":"The server made my rate go up but the host was awful.
She had no clue what she was doing at the stand and when we asked to be placed not in front of the kitchen (surround by open tables) she really didn't want to.
The server was so nice"}
{"text":"Their onion soup and prime rib was a-ok. For a chain steakhouse it's decent."}
{"text":"I made an order over the phone for a 40 oz. steak for 2 and was told 15 to 20 minutes for pickup. went to the restaurant at the time I hung up the phone. I sat in the restaurant for about 25 minutes in an area where I could see inside the kitchen and watched the manager bag an order and sit it on top of the ice machine and did not say anything to the barkeep about it being there. I looked at my cell phone clock at that time and it was 3:20 P.M. I noticed 5 different customers getting served their to go orders that came in about 20 minutes behind me. Asking the barkeep what was taking so long I was told my order would be coming up next. It is at that time 3:35 P.M. When the barkeep asked where my order was at she was told on top of the ice machine. Seeing what I saw I referred to the time it sat there and knowing how long it would take me to get home the food would be too cold to eat. Asked what I would like for them to do I asked to redo the order. Here comes the manager now asking me what was wrong. I told her then she said she would take care of it. Here comes the cook now refusing to redo my order and telling me blatantly that he had just taken the steak off the grill and it did not sit for any time at all. I told him I did not appreciate being called a liar and showed him the video of the transaction I had recorded on my cellphone and he then denied that was his kitchen. I asked for a refund then and he didn't want to do that either. I finally got my refund and left the restaurant not happy at all. UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I have had bad experience with phone orders in the past 3 months but this one takes the cake. Longhorn now has to suffer another dissatisfied ex customer who has been spending at least $100.00 a month at this location. I don't normaly post bad reviews because I am a business owner myself and know how they can hurt the business but this had to be posted. BTW I tried calling district manager who never returned my call and there is no place on longhorn website to complain or call the corporate office to complain. BAD BUSINESS and BAD MANAGEMENT when the cook is allowed to make the final decision to satisfy a customer"}
{"text":"I have tried several steaks at all different restaurants and no one has been able to make a better steak than Longhorns. I have been there multiple times thinking Oki they did a good job once but will it taste the same again. It never fails. It's amazing every time. Such delicious flavor. Their steaks are the best."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to dinner this past friday with our Gami (grandmother), and we were very satisfied. I can not remember our servers name, but she was nice and on top of the service. We all had a petite top sirloin one cooked med, and two cooked med rare. All three of us were pleased with the way our steaks had come out. While we were waiting for our food we were given the fresh warm loaf of bread that was tasty. The manager Cedric (sp?) had walked passed with two plates of their southweatern shrimp tacos and had asked if we liked shrimp. We replied with a yes and he gave us one of the plates of their southwestern shrimp tacos. My sister and I were extremely excited to try these tacos because they looked delicous and we had never had them before. Let me tell you.... \"they are our favorite!''  My sister and I noticed the tacos were part of their happy hour menue and now are planning for our next visit, just for the shrimp tacos alone. We followed our meal with the brownie sundae, which the managaer Cedrick suggested we get the candied pecans spinkled on top....great idea. the brownie was tasty, however my sister and I are ice cream lovers and wished there was a little more ice cream with the dish. Overall we left talking about how yummy it was and making plans to come back, so, I'd say our experience was a success and can't wait to come back. :)"}
{"text":"We went to this resturant with a group of our friends. The waitress did not seem in the mood for waiting! Anyway, the stake, mashed potato, salad and mushroom were quite tasty. We will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"My sister and I go there at least once a month. There service is good and food great. They make a wonderful Pittsburgh style Ribeye. That is what we always order, but last week we decided to try something different.  The server ask how was everthing, we said that we didn't care for what we ordered. She sent Manager over and ask us what was the problem,  we said we where sorry we hadn't order our usual that the order was a disappointment.  He offered to let us change our order. We excepted!  
Ended up a great meal and left happy and will definitely go back for our Ribeye Pittsburgh Style!"}
{"text":"We went out for a late lunch yesterday to the Longhorn Steakhouse on E Cactus Rd. The food and service was awesome. I ordered the Shaved Prime Rib Half Sandwich and had a cup of French Onion Soup. My husband had the Steak and Bacon Cheddar Melt with an order of fries. The food is Delicious. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Not s lot of space for large tables. Had to wait over 45  mins for a table for 8. Food is good and they were friendly"}
{"text":"Food is always very good, but the service is terrible!  We went today and we had the worst service ever out of any restaurant I have been to in over 10 years. They need to hire many more servers, because they all have too many tables and are not able to provide adequate service.  I should not have to wait 20 minutes to receive the bill after I ask for it."}
{"text":"Have never had bad food there. If it's busy service can be a little bit slow but isn't that to be expected anywhere?  Their medium rare is more on the rare side but that is explained on the menu.  Bread is good.  I am so glad to see them in Surprise. And they do have call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Slow and inattentive staff not making you feel as a welcomed guest.  Cookie cutter menu meeting basic expectations.  Watch out for the new garlic fries..... Make sure you grab a handful of mints."}
{"text":"First time here and I liked it. My husband and I both got the ribeye. Mine was slightly undercooked but it was still very good. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"So highly disappointed  with the experience we had. My boyfriend and I went out for his birthday, the waiter  was great, however there were so many things that made this experience  awful for one we ordered a couple drinks from the bar, they took about 15 minutes to get to us the restaurant  was only 1/4 of the way full and 4 people sitting at the bar there is no excuse for that. The appetizers  came it was delicious we had the chicken wraps I would definitely recommend  them then the \"manager\" came by with our entrée without asking set the plates down in front of us and walked away didn't care that she placed the plates wrong and didn't care to ask if we needed any condiments which we did. Then the ribeye which was ordered  medium rare was COMPLETELY RAW I almost threw up my boyfriend unfortunately  just wanted to enjoy his birthday. But he ended up eating two bites and having to box it up due to being too embarrassed  to complain. It completely  ruined his night. I am so disgusted especially after paying $56 then a tip for this meal I will never dine at longhorn steakhouse again. Not quite sure why it's okay to serve a RAW not rare RAW steak to someone.

UPDATE APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE MANAGER ITS OKAY TO SERVE A STEAK WITH SKIN STILL ON IT I WILL NEVER BRING BUSINESS TO LONG HORN AGAIN DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"This is a total \"take-back\" of my former review.  First, super thanks to the manager of Longhorn for taking my complaint seriously.  He said I should rightfully have gotten my steaks the way they were ordered, and he was very sorry.  He would send a gift card for my inconvenience.  Tried again last weekend.  EVERYTHING WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!  2 steaks--MR and M--perfect!  Salads--different then last time--perfect!  In my last review, I failed to mention that my potato was not cooked through.  This time--perfect!  I have no idea why these changes were so dramatic--new manager?  New head chef?  Additionally, I had a friend who said she was recently there and saw a major improvement from her last visit.  Whatever is going on, kudos to Copperfield Longhorn!  My special occasions are yours!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"From entry to exit, one terrible experience.
Came in with my 12 year old son and they try to seat us at the bar!!! Hello!
Next we are seated in a section with a 12 person party. After close to ten minutes of being ignored we ask to be moved where we can be waited on. Move again. We order two burgers, medium. In the meantime, people who came in after us are getting bread, drinks, etc before us by the same waitress. 
I flagged down a manager, female, did not get her name. She assures me we are not being shunned for having too small of a check. She promises it will get better and that she will \"personally supervise your order\". Forty more minutes go by and she comes over saying it's almost ready. Arrives well done and black, hard and burnt. I asked waitress to bring manager back. I tell her we are leaving. She tries another pitch like the first time but I am wiser this time. We leave well over one hour later, deciding where to go and eat. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin. It took us 1 hour to seat a party of 6. When we get to the back the seating area was wide open. The waiters were just siting around and talking. The waiter was really sarcastic. The manager was even worse. Took another 30-45 minutes for us to get food. DO NOT COME HERE!   The absolute worse service ever"}
{"text":"Update ... place has gone down hill, sorry to report.
Second time we were seated and learned upon ordering they were out of prime rib.
INFORM THE PATRONS BEFORE YOU SEAT THEM!
Service is mediocre at best and takes forever.
Many other good steak places in the immediate area that are much better.
Will not be coming back to Longhorn.
Too bad ... it started off so well."}
{"text":"This place I have been hoping and waiting for since I started seening their commercials on TV, now that they are here they are my new regular place to go, my parents are coming into town this weekend from California and they want to go as they have seen the commercials in California too. So we are going to dinner tonight."}
{"text":"My mom brought me here for dinner during Mom's weekend (when restaurants are PACKED!).  We only had a short wait, even though we didn't have a reservation and it was prime dinner hour.

Our waiter was very helpful and attentive, he  offered good suggestions. Our salads came out quickly and were delicious.    We did wait a long time to get our entrees; our waiter apologized several times for the long wait.  He ended up offering us a free dessert of our choice to compensate for the long wait time.  

That is excellent customer service.  And the food was quite good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok this was on a Sunday. The hostess told us our wait would be 15 minutes or less. Almost a half hour later we we're still waiting even know the place was half empty. 
       I think they actually sat down a whole family that arrived after us without a reservation. As we sat waiting I had a chance to read the reviews about how small the portion sizes are and how horrible the food is. The food in the pictures didn't look good. 
          The whole point of eating out is to try food that you normally wouldn't have at home. I mean I've gotten better microwaveable meals from wholesale chains like Costco than they appear to offer from their kitchen. 
       So we returned our coaster pager, and left. We ended up at a really good mediterranean restaurant down the street. The middle eastern platter was amazing. Surprisingly the place was empty.
         Its to bad the locals would rather waste money on these generic chain places for bad service and crappy food than support a local mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I are great fans of Longhorns and have been returning customers for a long time. Steaks are always seasoned perfectly, the service could not be better and every dish we have ever tried has been placed on our favorite list! The last time we were there, the steak I had was not a very good piece so I brought it to the attention of the server. Immediately, the manager was over doing everything he could to make it right. I ended up with a whole new dinner, even though I had eaten most of it before the issue with the steak. The manager waited until I signaled that everything was perfect before he left our table and he still came back several more times to make sure we were all satisfied. Very impressive and this was up and above their regular excellent service! I wanted to take the time to extend major kudos to the manager and serving staff! Thank you so much for your consideration and true customer service!"}
{"text":"Great steaks here! Always consistent and typically good service.  I get the cowboy ribeye which is delicious and seasoned right.  The calamari with sweet chili sauce is an excellent appetizer. Only 4 stars due to the prices a little on the high side. A solid meal that will leave you satisfied"}
{"text":"I am a food and drink snob. I took my niece and nephew there in Phoenix. It appears they have renovated these restaurants and are much more palatable than 6 years ago. Food was a 7 out of 10. I did not dislike our dinner."}
{"text":"We had the perfect meal and experience today! We started off our lunch hungry and ordered the jalapeño shooters and spicy calamari. I could have ordered a second round of those because they were that delicious. I also want to mention that the presentation of the jalapeño shooters was nice as they had them dipped in sauce inside a shooter glass. Fantastic job on cooking the calamari perfectly. I've definitely had calamari over cooked but this was on point. We then each ordered the ribeye. I had mine medium rare and my husband had his medium. They nailed the temperature on the steaks perfectly. I have seen some other reviewers mention the temperature to be off, but who ever cooks at lunch time is awesome! The seasoning on the steaks was also very balanced. You can't go wrong with their teas and lemonades either! 

We also enjoyed our server who we had on a prior visit (both times were great service). She remembered us which is always nice as it makes you feel welcomed. 

As Strongsville locals, this is definitely one of our spots!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night at 7:00pm and there is a 25 minute wait for a table? I count 18 open tables...
I am not sure if it is because they don't have enough servers or they're trying to alienate the locals. 
Note to management: not good business"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic hands down. Went at lunch on a Wednesday. Ordered the 6 oz sirloin medium rare w/ a side of mashed potatoes and butter. The steak was slightly charred on the outside but upon opening it revealed a perfect medium rare throughout. This can only be done with lots of experience. The mashed potatoes were are like close to homemade. The service was great at the bar even though it was busy. The outside of the steak seasoned perfectly.  This was by far the best dining experience I've had in months."}
{"text":"Went on Friday and as many know restaurants on bell rd on Fridays are busy. There was an hour wait, so we had a glass of wine while we waited. When we got our table service was pretty fast. We placed our order, I order the stuffed cheese and bacon filet. My husband got the prime rib. Your order comes with one side and a salad. I ordered Mac and cheese which cost extra, my husband got loaded baked potato. I had regular salad and my husband had Cesar salad. My salad was good, the Cesar salad was good but not enough dressing.  I order my filet medium and it came out medium well. Not good considering we had waited about 30 minutes after our salads came out to get our steaks. I told the server about my steak and he told me he would get another one out to me. So my husband at his meal and about 1#. Minutes I finally received my medium steak it was good, but I would not order it again. Cheese was hard and not enough. My husband was already done with his food, so he had to wait for me to eat. Also his loaded bake potato was not loaded and was really dry, we did order more of the loaded to add. Overall, I will not be back! I spent about 2 1/2 hours there and was not impressed. If the food was really good, I would not have minded the slow service. It was just OK. Texas Roadhouse is much better!"}
{"text":"The service was good hence the one star. My girlfriend ordered mashed potatoes with brown gravy and what they brought out was mashed potatoes with BBQ SAUCE!!!! What the hell were they thinking?!?? Won't be coming back to this Long Horn. Oh and my steak was well done not medium like I requested."}
{"text":"One star for service, another star for the mushroom truffle soup. 

The rest of the food was basically inedible. 

Since this is a big company, i really expect that they provide adequate training to their kitchen staff; unfortunately there were just too many careless, basic mistakes from the kitchen for me to give them a second chance. 

1. Risotto was out in less than 5 minutes after i ordered and lukewarm. It was mushy and watery on the plate and uncooked inside the rice. I wonder if they took out a frozen pack and microwaved it. Also there was NO porcini in a dish called porcini risotto. Liars.   

2. Burger was thick and DRY. As in, one side of the burger was completely black it was like chewing on cardboard. The bun was dry and flavorless. I hate ketchup but i had to keep spreading ketchup on every bite in order o add some moisture so i can swallow. It was just terrible. 

3. The pork chop came in two strips (???). I asked for medium which i confirmed should be warm pink in the center. Well one strip was completely cooked, dry, chewy, while the other strip was RAW. By raw i mean pink slimy transparent meat in the center. 

FAIL. Will not return. :("}
{"text":"Had a xmas family gathering here and loved it. Food was wonderful (try the pork chops. Yum!), service was top notch (ask to sit with Michele) and everything was just about as good as you would expect. My only observation is that the prices of the menu items seem a couple dollars higher than they should be (given what all you get) but that's a minor issue. Our party had the parmesan chicken, the shaved prime rib sandwich, the primetime burger and the pork chops.They were all delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times now. The service is usually pretty good except for one other occasion, but today when I went for lunch with my boyfriend, the service was outstanding. Salena was amazing, very friendly and attentive. The food was great too! I had the chopped salad and chicken wraps and my boyfriend had the filet with rice! I highly recommend this location to anyone who is looking for an amazing steak and if Salena is working I definitely advise you to request her section. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and it was amazing both times!  Even though this a steak place, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken.  It was so juicy and delicious.  I had a loaded baked potato and mac & cheese for the sides.  I'm pretty sure it was the most delicious mac & cheese I've ever had!  Definitely home made.  
The service was excellent and the restaurant is very clean & spacious.
I can't wait to go back! 
P.S. ~ If you leave room for desert, You won't be disappointed with the chocolate lava cake."}
{"text":"I went last night with my sister and a cousin and we had a very enjoyable dinner.  I had the salmon with rice and a Caesar salad.  The salmon was tasty and sides were equally good.  My sister had the prime rib, medium rare and it looked delicious.  She ate it all and was quiet all through dinner, so it must have been good otherwise she would have been a lot more \"chatty.\"  My cousin's steak was ordered medium but was a little too rare for her.  Our server, Carly, was very friendly and a great waitress.  The service was quick and our drinks (Sangria and a margarita) were very tasty.  The atmosphere was pleasant and you can actually have a conversation without yelling.   I can't wait to go back and try the prime rib!"}
{"text":"Expected more from this place. The steak (ribeye) failed to sway me. It was cooked right but had little flavor. The sides were alright. The appetizers were good. The service was somewhat suspect and overdone. When asked for a specific request, the staff took their time. I would go elsewhere for a steak."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday and did not wait longer than 15 minutes.  I had the parmesan crusted sirloin which was the best.  My daughter had the bacon wrapped fillet and my husband had the rib eye.  The meat was juicy, tender, and very well seasoned.  I normally don't order sirloin, but it was the best I have ever had. The bread is warm and delicious.  My daughter did order her steak well done and it was medium rare. We did have to send it back and when it came back it was perfect. The manager was very apologetic and took her meal off our bill plus gave her a free dessert. The decor and atmosphere are nice.  The waitress was wonderful very attentive.  I will definitely will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Came in the other night, visiting the old stomping grounds, and had Kristi as a waitress. She was OUTSTANDING!

Super engaged/engaging, very friendly and attentive. She was hilarious, too!

everyone's food was cooked perfectly - but i feel like that goes without saying. I don't see much point in reviewing the food at a chain restaraunt because everyone knows exactly what they're getting in terms of food quality as soon as they go there - that's the point of going to a chain. but Kristi was just great. I'm not sure if i had a crush on her because she was so darn awesome, or if it was just because she brought me food. Both are equally plausible."}
{"text":"I like longhorn. The food and service is usually good. But not so much this time. Our order wasn't difficult. 2 iced teas, one white peach, one blackberry. 1 appetizer sampler (the server commented it was a good choice) and 2 strawberry chicken salads. First I put my straw in the peach iced tea and took a sip and WOW I was shocked by a mouth full of warm peach flavored syrup. Yuck. After mixing it a bit I tried again and it was still way too sweet. The bread came three pieces for two people. Ok, we can share, no problem. No plates came with the bread. So we ate over the table 
It was awhile before any food came out and it was our salads. We had to ask for our appetizer. The order was never put in so it came out when we were about half way done. And again, no small plates with the appetizer. We had to ask for them. Oh, then we were asked if we wanted more bread. No thanks, we are more than half way through the meal now. I asked for a glass of plain unsweetened iced tea and cut my peach tea so it was drinkable. 
The appetiZers were good.  The service was not so good."}
{"text":"If you like waitresses who argue with you regarding whether your steak is a T bone or Ribeye, a total lack of accountability around a totally messed up order and 1 of a party of 4 eating a full 30 minutes after the rest of the table, this is the place for you. 
I mean, you would think someone who works in a steakhouse could tell the difference between a TBone and a Ribeye.  Then when the mistake was pointed out (and as a server you watch your guests fix the messed up potato order at the table) the gracious and judicious thing to do is to acknowledge it, apologize, offer to discount the steak at the table or to replace it and bring the table dessert without asking.  Instead, we came up against attitude from both the waitress and the management, the steak and baked potato thrown into the garbage resulting in a 30 minute wait for the correct steak while everyone else ate.  When the Tbone finally arrived it was served with mashed potatoes because they threw the previous baked potato away and were then out. No one ordered or wanted mashed potatoes. Do you think they could have admitted their lack of judgment in throwing away a perfectly good baked potato and ask if we wanted mashed potatoes before just throwing then on the plate? Meanwhile we got a lame apology, no discount, and a good dose of inconvenience and rudeness.  
In tough economic times, people have a choice of where to spend their hard earned money and a little less attitude and a lot more accommodation would certainly improve the chance of return customers.  They would have two stars but we re-plated the potatoes to match the people who ordered them, and the entire staff actually could have cared less about their mistakes.  The 3 fillets ordered at the table were not cooked to order, or if they were, didn't manage to be served to the person who ordered them.  My medium fillet had been butterflied, was more well than medium and tough though well seasoned.  My cousin's fillet also ordered medium, was closer to rare than medium.  
My advice is find a good local restaurant and skip the chain or if you're local, fire up the grill and spend the money on a good steak to cook at home.  It's obvious they don't care if you come back, and even if your grilling skills are lacking, it's going to be better than what you would get at this facility."}
{"text":"Average all around. I prefer outback if I'm wanting steak from a chain restaurant. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This is one of the few, better places to eat in Gastonia. They are almost always consistent with quality, presentation and service. It's a nice dining atmosphere. Very clean establishment. Worth the wait. They are however,sometimes off their A-game when it's busy, or rushed, otherwise can't complain. 
I gotta say, I love a ribeye as good as the next person, but they have perfected their Renegade Sirloin. Try it Parmesan crusted with sweet potato and steamed broccoli for only about $14, yummy!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat with an upscale atmosphere.  Fast service and a varied menu. Delicious food and nice presentation.  The surroundings are western and tastefully done. One of the best steak houses in Surprise."}
{"text":"I took my Mom there for her birthday we had a nice time. We arrived about 12;30 pm we had the dinner for 2. It was really good. 
There was a lady's group playing cards at one of the large middle tables and it was fun watching them.  
I hope next time I go the food is just as good. Hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"Last week I went to LongHorn for the first time in a long time, I went with my mom mostly because she had never been to LongHorn before and we usually like to try someplace new when we go out together. When we first got in we were told we'd have to wait 15-20 minutes because a big party had shown up before us and they wanted to give the chef's time to catch up, glad they were at least honest with us. 

We ended up waiting the latter time but when we were seated the menu had many savory things on it. I'm not much of a steak person so I got the Raspberry Balsamic vinaigrette chicken, my mom got the pepper crusted steak. It took a good thirty five minutes for our meal to come out to us, but it was well worth the wait. Both our meals were outstanding, hot tender and flavorful. I tried some of my mom's steak and convinced me next time to order it. my chicken was very good with the sauce it came with. However the food is pricey, our bill for two people came to sixty dollars.

So I give this LongHorn four stars, the service was good as one can expect, the food gets a five star rating but the overpricing was the only thing preventing a perfect rating. But we will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"I try to avoid chain restaurants because the service can be hit or miss. Team mates wanted steak, so we went. We arrived at 11:45 and got our check just before 1:30. They were extremely backed up. My steak was served cold. I ordered it medium and received medium well and it was extremely chewy. Someone did come over and offer us a free dessert because we waited so long for our steaks but we could not extend our lunch time any longer."}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife and I went to the Longhorn off W.T. Harris and old Mallard Creek.  The service was very good.  My wife and I had the $9.00 lunch special steak burgers.  The bread and butter was great.  Fresh baked rolls with real butter.  The salad was awesome.  We both love the bleau cheese dressing there.  The burgers were delicious on a homemade bun and served with real cheddar cheese.

Maybe the best burgers we have ever had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday today and my daughter brought me to the restaurant. We ordered and it took 30 minutes to get the food and not only that the food had NO seasoning. I was not impressed. My daughter paid her hard earned money to be dissatisfied for not only me, but herself as well. Oh, and by the way this was our first time here. We will not be returning. 
Worst birthday dinner :-("}
{"text":"Waiter took our order and ignored us for over 35 minutes, did not bring salads, bread or even bother to say what was going on in the kitchen. We were totally ignored. Left $10.00 for our sodas and left. Extremely poor service. Very disappointed!! Drove about a mile up the road and had delicious meal at Texas Roadhouse with great service, wasn't there 5 minutes and we had drinks, rolls and our salads. Don't think this location will be in business in 6 months if not before."}
{"text":"I'm not big on steak. I only get Flo's filet . I've never gotten a lousy meal here. The only complaint I had has been too much salad dressing on my salad & sometimes the food comes out too fast. I wised up & get the dressing on the side now. The stuffed mushroom app is my favorite. Steaks are always cooked as ordered. Luv the rib dinner,oh so tender! May be too tender for some rib lovers. Service has always been good. Reasonably priced good food its hard to beat LHSH. I'm craving a filet right now !!"}
{"text":"The other day, my family (6 people) and I came into Longhorn for dinner. Our server was Michael and he did an outstanding job. Our drinks were always filled, he gave us a few loaves of bread at a time which was excellent! We all got steak or fish and each bite was absolutely delicious. There wasn't a bite left on our plates. The service was great, food was even better and we will continue to come back for many years. AMAZING steak. I get mine well done and the cook managed to get my meat tender and fully cooked which is hard to do. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was trying to grab a quick dinner. Came in and sat at the bar. They were not crowded so I thought I was going to get in and out. However, the three guys working the bar were too busy talking about how hot 2 of the waitresses are to take my order. I had to ask 2 different staff for a menu. Then, I had to ask they wipe the bar in front of me as it was filthy. They wiped it with a rag that was dirtier than the bar and smelled like spoiled fish.  I asked for a glass of water at this point; but never got it. I then sat there for 15 minutes (I looked at my phone so it was 15 minutes) as the staff stood around and talked. I finally walked out. I mentioned what happened to the hostess, but she was too busy looking at her phone. 

What a bunch of amateurs."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drinks. Good price. Good service. Good place to eat. Come to longhorn. Tell them Monte sent you."}
{"text":"I love Longhorn. We went here for a family outing with my Mom. I love their selection of goods.

We only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was friendly but not as timely. She was pretty attentive to my sons peanut allergy and took an extra few minutes to ensure that the bread only had oats in it. 

I ordered their parmsean crusted chicken with a sweet potatoe with sugar and cinnamon and  a salad. I ordered my son Mac and cheese and   fries.

While waiting quite some time for our food, the manager came out and thanked us for our patience because they had a large party in front of us and told us that the food would be out shortly. It did come out soon after but wasn't the best. My sons fries were cold. My husband did not receive his side of mac, my mom asparagus was not cooked well done as she requested and the waitress told her that he put them in the microwave twice . My chicken lacked the usual amount of topping and when I asked for more she said $1.50. The waitress rarely checked on us, so eventually we boxed up everything and asked for the check in which the manger gave us boxes and my husband had to walk the check to a station.

Overall, the experience this time was not the best and the food was OK but I would definitely go back because they do have wonderful food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but to be honest the service was subpar. I don't know if it was a bad night, maybe it was, but it defiantly tarnished my experience here a bit. To be totally honest, it was either here or Texas Roadhouse, should have gone to the roadhouse. I don't know, I might give it another chance."}
{"text":"My husband and my favorite restaurant for dinner. We love the salads and steaks. Since it is usually soooo busy about a 40 minute wait everytime we go. We sit and eat at the bar since it's just the two of us. We actually love sitting at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and fast service. I really wouldn't want to sit anywhere else. I'll be back again! Thanks."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the best dinner last night!  Everything was delicious! He ordered the t-bone and I had the filet. Absolutely the best steak house!"}
{"text":"We came in, tired, but I don't think we were rude in any way. However, I guess the hostess didn't like us. She sat about 6 or 7 parties before us, even though they clearly came in after us. I asked how much longer, she said we were next, and then we got a seat. I asked if there was a call ahead system, and there is, but the party before us didn't use it, and they got seated before us. Been here several times before and it's been good, but tonight, the hostess just totally ruined it for us."}
{"text":"When we decided to go here it was on a whim while shopping. Given the fact it's a chain we really didn't expect a whole lot maybe an average steak.  I as always went T bone and my wife had there special I think an outlaw with a bacon stuffed middle. Staff was great and courteous service was prompt and prices completely acceptable especially after eating!  We were both extremely happy with all courses of the meal. The overall setting was very nice as well. We have gone back numerous times only to experience the same end result."}
{"text":"We have visited this location twice & the food was very good.  On our second visit, There was a problem with our order in the kitchen and didn't get our food in a timely manner.  The manager was very apologetic and made certain that we were served within 5 minutes of becoming aware of the situation. He is very efficient and is concerned that his customers have a good experience. The wait staff is very pleasant & attentive.  We will definitely be dining at this location."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place is delicious!!! Bread they first served just melts in your mouth. The steak is soo juicy. The servers seem to love their job. This is my favorite steakhouse!"}
{"text":"On Friday 2/17/17 we visited LongHorns steak house in handler.  My family an I have been dining there since their opening.  We have always been pleased and happy with the great steaks and value for the meals.  Unfortunately last nights. Is it was not as good.  We ordered wine that is usually on Happy Hour prices, we were told the company discontinued Happy Hour.  Disappointment began there and didn't stop. There were five of us with me celebrating my birthday.  Three of us ordered steak for our entree, one Filet Minion, one child's sirloin steak and myself ordering a Ribeye 18oz.  The child's steak was so tough it was not able to be cut with a steak knife.  My friends Filet was much smaller then the intended order and my 18 oz Ribeye was extremely small and tough .  Judging from many dining experiences in this very restaurant, I'd consider something suspicious. Could this company be in trouble?  I will consider another restaurant in the near future.  I no longer will recommend this place as it has become undependable."}
{"text":"Went here cause we had a gift card. I had the mussels in octoberfest beer with broth.. it was SO good. I had Strawberry pecan salad, yum . Hubs had steak..good and minion had chicken fingers. It was good food. However. ...everyone around us had issues with how they're steak was cooked. Everyone.  Hubs said his was fine, he ate the whole thing.  I'll believe that people possibly don't know how to order their steaks....I'm not a steak fan, which is why I did the mussels. .DAMN...good!!"}
{"text":"I just visited this restaurant and I'm very disappointed. Today is my son's birthday and he's a big fan of steak, so we decided to take him to this restaurant. First, we were sat down and taken drink orders. Server brought back my husband and I our drinks but not our son's drink and never received our bread. I was confused and thought maybe bread is extra and we have to order it. Next thing I see is a different server bringing bread to his table. Looked around and found that everyone had bread but us. Tried to track down our server and he was nowhere to be found. Other employees/managers walked by but didn't care to ask if we needed anything and it's been 15 minutes by now. Finally, we find our server. He walks past us and went on to take care of other tables. I said, okay he'll get to our table soon but he never did. By this point, I had to flag down our server. I asked if we can get some bread and my son's drink. He didn't even care to apologize for not having them, instead he made an excuse of the bread not being ready and no reasoning for not bringing my son's drink. If that was the case of the bread, then why not kindly let us know that the bread should be on it's way instead of walking past our table and not letting us know? And if that was also the case then why did we have to see other tables being brought bread? We finally get our dinner, the same time we get our bread and my son's drink. Dinner was great! Food was good, no complaints there. Server is also aware that it is our son's birthday so he does end up bringing our son an ice cream. The ice cream has a candle but the server said he didn't have anything to light it with. My son turned 3, so he gets very excited over little things like blowing out his candles. AND again after he finishes his ice cream we see yet another table with a birthday that also received ice cream BUT their candle was lit AND they sang to them. AGAIN, very upsetting. Obviously, our server didn't care or try hard enough to get it lit for my son. I'm just very disappointed that we didn't receive the same treatment as other tables. I felt like we weren't good enough to get good service or important enough to be taken care of. I usually don't get upset about things like this but the fact that we wanted it to be special for our son is what really upset me. Customer service here was HORRIBLE! We will never return to this restaurant after our disappointing night we had tonight."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. We went here on Saturday, simply because we had a gift card. We aren't usually chain restaurant people, but someone in my family gave us a gift card.

We each ordered a glass of wine and decided to split the 11 oz sirloin steak with loaded potatoe. I'm so glad we split it. Definitely enough for two people (and my husband is an eater too!). Good steak, well seasoned. Side was good too. Nothing special but good.

Just some things I noted that were kinda off:
-We didn't say anything about this cause in the end, we didn't care that much. However, they seated us at the booth that shares the wall with the kitchen/server station area. It was pretty loud.....and there were servers standing like 3 feet from us chatting....and dishes banging. At one point, someone in the kitchen dropped a crap ton of silverwear. It was so loud, I jumped out of my seat haha. Pretty distracting. I mentioned to my husband that if we were a couple that never went out very often and we were going out for a special meal, I would be pretty upset, cause we could barely hear each other. We got there at like 5:30 and there were plenty of other seats in the place.....I would only use that table to seat people as a last resort. 
-Our waitress was kinda non-existent. Basically, she brought us a menu, initial drinks, food, and check. Which is kinda odd considering the serving station was a mere 5 feet from us! My water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled. Not a huge issue cause I did have my wine :)
-Lastly, I don't know if I even have the right to mention this. I mean we did split a meal and that isn't how most couples do it. However, they brought out one salad and one meal. Like no extra dishes, no splitting anything, etc. I mean we are super laid back people so we never said anything and just dug in and ate. However, afterwards, both of us mentioned it to each other. The salad was so big. They could have easily split the amount of lettuce and dressing and just put it in two bowls so we werent reaching across the table. It would have just created one extra dish to clean...big deal.

It's little things like the above that can make or break an experience....especially when there are soooooooo many restuarants in the area. Unless someone happens to give us another gift card, we probably won't return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with some coworkers.  First off, our table was off kilter and constantly rocked back forth...super annoying. Our service was good but my steak was not as tender as I hoped it would be. I asked for medium rare but it was on the tough side. My sweet potato was quite small, but pretty tasty. Would I go back? Probably not due to the quality of steak I was served."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, left sitting for 10 minutes without anyone coming to table to serve. Got up and left a young girls just smiled and said sorry!! What help is that. Then called to ask about to go order and a girl named Jasmine (attitude problem) was not helpful at all about a request to have chicken tenders cut in pieces and done in the spicy chicken sauce. Said it was to much work for cook to cut up!! Apparently she's never cut a chicken strip. I enjoy Longhorns across the country but will never go to this one."}
{"text":"Great food at a recent lunch visit, steak and fish were superbly prepared with fresh ingredients. 

Service slow and unengaged--not overly busy, just didn't seem to know how to anticipate needs--or care.  Never checked to see if steak was done properly--fortunately for her, it was.

 Host needs a Valium-seriously.  Or change restaurant name to Barnum and Bailey. (there's enthusiasm and then there's having a manic episode)

Pretty decor and expansive menu--ample parking

Would have been 4 stars with better service!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is great! If you haven't eaten here yet.... You need too! I had the ribeye and it was perfect! Every bite only made me want the next. The loaded mashed potatoes were great and the Mac and cheese was the best!"}
{"text":"As always a great meal. This is my wife and my 5th visit at this restaurant and always pleased."}
{"text":"Said service won't take a reservation! They said they will start in July! I laughed and said all the snowbirds will gone by then and you won't need a reservation! CorpAmerica!!!"}
{"text":"First you must ask for Christine, Woody or Michael for the best service in my opinion.  The calamari doesn't disappoint with sauce on the side if the heat is too much for you. In my opinion best chop steak on the West Side and just love the Shrimp chowder."}
{"text":"We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of us,but there's lots of other places to spend that money-"}
{"text":"My first 2 times here were so good, both food and service. I got the Renegade Sirloin, and I usually get medium well, and it was cooked perfect for me and not bloody or anything. The meat was quality no gristle or fat, just a great couple times. This being late 2013 for both visits. This place is getting a generous 2 stars from me because I'm remember how good it use to be.....

Then my 2 or 3 visits this year were just downhill.....

One of the times the waitress added herself a nice $10 tip to my debit card, as I didn't give one on the credit card receipt because I left an already generous CASH tip with my card receipt since I happened to have cash and figured it'd be nice for her to be able to take the tip this night. I was pretty effing mad when I saw the charge and talked to my husband about it and he verified exactly what I said about leaving cash.....but it was a busy time for me right after holidays and I didn't end up calling them or anything like that. Still wish I would have though because it's the audacity of the act and feeling violated, not about the measly $10.

Even after this incident, I got convinced to go back there. Got some nasty burnt, black, dry steaks and just lame service. First couple times we went service was so good along with food, then with the thieving waitress and then disappearing wait staff (when it's not even busy) besides low quality food I can honestly say I won't waste my time or money here ever again. Thinking of trying a local place next time and hoping it is better.

My best tip would be if you go there, don't use a credit or debit card, use cash. And I guess order your steak less cooked than you like it since it seems to come out more cooked than what you order."}
{"text":"Went to Longhorn the other night and as always was very pleased. Our server Denea was absolutely amazing. Very friendly and attentive and gave us an overall enjoyable experience. The food was awesome! We love the calamari appetizer and the lava cake.....they are the main reasons we come. Always a great time at longhorn. Be sure to ask for Matt or Denea they are by far the best servers."}
{"text":"The last few times we came here we have been disappointed! Raised the prices a lot and the quality has gone downhill! Very disappointed! This was the last time me and my family will go here!"}
{"text":"Love their food and service. They are all about making the customer happy. Especially this last time we went, our server was very nice and patient. Also a lady kept coming and asking to make sure everything was good. That is the kind of service other restaurants should be practicing too."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"worst experience ever!!!
Got to wait for more than 1 hour to be seated(which I can understand since it was so packed). But when we got there, the table was filthy dirty. Some pieces of veggies sticked to the table, crumbles was scattered on top of the table and on the seat, and not to mention the table itself was shiny because of some sort of oil and kinda sticky on some part. The right word for it : GROSS!!! 
 Things get more unpleasant when the waitress itself was kinda ignoring us.After gave us our drinks,she rush quickly in the speed of light.
It got more worst after she left us with our warm bread and salad without any silverware or extra napkins. DUH!! Are we supposed to chew them down like a cow??
So much for the expensive piece of steak for this unpleasant experience.
Just like Taylor Swift said: WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER GETTING BACK TO LONGHORN...!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the porterhouse steak, medium. Was very delicious and fell apart with every bite. Sweet potato was delicious and seasoned perfectly. Also tried for the first time the fried pickles. Was surprisingly good. The price was reasonable. The waiter was really genuinely happy to see us and even sat down to talk. Drinks were filled and had no problems at all. Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"I usually go to this location when I am in Charlotte for business because it is close to my work.   I was less than impressed this time.  I ordered the Outlaw Rib-eye and was highly disappointed.  It was flavorless and I had to add a ton of salt.   There was a lot of chewy tendons and ligaments and stuff that were difficult to eat.  It was cooked to a good medium rare like I wanted, but it really didn't have any flavor, and I refuse to use steak sauce on a steak because a good steak never requires it.  
The service was just okay.  My server was nice, but not friendly at all.  She did what she was supposed to do; take my order, bring out my food, give me my bill.  She only filled my water when I asked her to.  The salad was very bland and didn't have much dressing.  The bread seemed really dried out and flavorless as well.  Not sure I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Went here as a celebration treat and I must say I have to go again, the staff was awesome from the greeter to the waiter. Had the Ribeye with a Shrimp skewer and rice, all was excellent. Steak was grilled to perfection, you could have cut it with a butter knife and the shrimp also well done.
Drinks was a good size and well made, must go to again."}
{"text":"Relatively slow service.  The waitress was extremely nice but I think they had her spread too thin today.  But that wasn't the real issue.  The food left a lot to be desired.  Had tasty appetizers then it went downhill from there.  Had the lobster/shrimp chowder.  The seafood was grossly overcooked.  Then had a 10 Oz \"Flo's Filet\" (Center Cut Filet Mignon).  The filet was cooked to the appropriate temperature but had a very grainy mouth feel and completely lacked seasoning.  I normally wouldn't dare use steak sauce with a good steak but not even A1 could save this poor piece of meat.  The manager was kind and offered a replacement but I didn't really have time for a new steak to be prepared.  I was also nervous about asking for another steak since this one was so bad.  Again... no reflection on the server.  She was awesome even in spite of being overworked.  And the Manager who made an attempt to resolve the issue.  But this was a TOTAL miss for the chef and the chef alone!"}
{"text":"Took an half hour to get my SALAD. An hour and no sign of our food. When we arrived we saw that they brush the table crumbs onto the seats. The service here is awful. I would not return. I ordered a 6oz steak, it came out, it was 3 oz and tasted like liver."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on New Years Eve. The staff is super friendly and so attentive. Drinks were never empty, the bread was always warm and fresh, and our waitress was super polite and fun. The food was superb! Best steak I've had in a long time! Great price too! Totally was expecting higher prices for the quality and service we received."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at LongHorn.  The steaks are always cooked to perfection - as ordered.  I love the Spicy Chicken Bites for an appetizer.  The staff are always great - but a tremendous shout out to Thomas R - who is the absolute best at customer service."}
{"text":"Our server Lauren was so nice, always checking if we needed something else. Ver attentive. We ordered Redrock Grilled Shrimp. It was good but a little in the salty side. The appetizer was so good. Stuffed Shrimp with Cheese. Will be back..."}
{"text":"Just in around town lunch town and drop by Longhorn with my mom. Service was great, food was good a beautiful afternoon. My mom's Tilapia in Mango Salsa was so good. I'm always back."}
{"text":"It's not a very good LongHorn. Every time we've came here we've had to wait FOREVER and then we usually have bad service. I like the LongHorn in Rock Hill much better because it has better service and better food."}
{"text":"Steak was great and prices were reasonable.It can be crazy busy on a Friday night,you might want to go there after 6 PM on a Friday.4 Stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I've been coming here for some time and when we went here tonight the server Samantha  and manager Richard were both amazing there was a simple mistake with the steaks but they were wonderful and made our experience there great we will be coming back more often"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner on Sunday night arriving at 6pm. As to be expected we had about 15 minutes to wait for a table. We waited in the bar and had a beer (I always appreciate when the beer is cold)

Atmosphere
The décor is warm and welcoming. I did not notice trash on the floor nor did there seem to be any disrepair. Additionally, everything seems to be clean. The noise level was not overwhelming, the usual mummer of conversation and the occasional child letting a yell/cry.

Service 
The staff was friendly and attentive. They worked as a team to ensure the bread, water and food was delivered. Wendie was attentive and very efficient. She did a great job making sure our meal was what we expected. The manager even stopped by to ensure there were not any issues and we were satisfied with the experience.

Food
My wife had the ribeye with a loaded baked potato. Her steak was cooked perfectly. She said it was so good she did not even need the steak sauce brought with the meal. The only thing she left of her potato was the skin. She really enjoyed her meal. I had the prime time burger. This is a monster of burger,  1/2 pound of hamburger with slices of prime rib on it. There were also mushrooms and onions and Swiss cheese. It was cooked perfectly, the horseradish sauce and the au jus was a perfect complement to meat. I also enjoyed my meal.

If you are expecting a high end steak house meal this is not for you. If you are looking for good food and a pleasant experience this is your place!"}
{"text":"Anna was our server and she was awesome! It was a busy new year eve and she was on top of her game! Prime rib, new york strip and Flo's filet was perfect! Great job!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. Have always had awesome service and great food. My boyfriend and I go here for every occasion. Shout out to our server Michelle for going above and beyond. She was fabulous, patient, kind and respectful. We go back all the time anyway but now will be asking for her specifically."}
{"text":"Not good at all, can  not describe it its just bad. I can make a better steak at home. They also burned my rib eye."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Boyfriend and i go here once a month it's sooooo good! Service is great & food
Comes out perfect everytime. I don't know why people love Texas Roadhouse this place blows them out of the water. I haven't gone to Texas Roadhouse since i found this place. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"This 5 star review is based on the food, the value, and the quality of service.

My wife and I love this particular Longhorn Steakhouse location. We come here about once a month. The steaks are always cooked the way we order them, and even my wife's \"well-done\" order comes out tasty. The salads and sides are delicious, and the free bread doesn't hurt!

The servers, hostesses, and management have always been helpful and polite. One time we tried one of their new sides, and it really wasn't appetizing at all. The manager apologized, explained they were trying to get it right, replaced it with another side, and gave us free cheesecake at the end of our meal! This is the way quality service should work."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at about 6pm.  No waiting at all as the place was about half full.  Was nice to get a booth.  Decent atmosphere that tries to be rustic but is too new looking to give it a real rustic feel.

We all got the rib eye steak and it was VERY flavorful and cooked right.  I just wish it would have been thicker as it was really thin.  The baked potato was loaded with sour cream, butter and cheese.  The salad was fine but it came in a small plastic bowl which made me feel like I was in a cafeteria.  Plus the croutons were straight out of a box which also reminded me of a cafeteria.

The service was good.  Our waitress was super friendly.  They said unlimited bread but we only got one loaf.

Decent.  4 stars."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a 5 star review. the extra 5th star is without a doubt due to the extraordinary service that we received from ACE. But I must not leave out the exceptional food this is only my second time to this restaurant and both times the food and service was AWSOME. This particular time I ordered the salmon it was the"}
{"text":"The waiter was laid back and attentive.. Great service.. Very clean! Wonderful tilapia very fresh seasoned perfectly! I highly suggest the tilapia with the brown butter sauce YUM! Also the fire cracker shrimp appetizer was excellent the shrimp was succulent and the hot peppers were yummy. Good eats enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch today between meetings since usually lunch at other locations is quick. Sat at the bar and waited for 7 minutes and was ignored by several staff members who walked by.  Got to hear a conversation between two employees in the staff area beside the bar complaining about their hours and the amount of tips they'd made. After the 7 minutes I stood up, walked out (passing the host who also ignored me) and left. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Ordered a small sirloin knowing it's not always the tender choice. However, I was not prepared for the cut that was served me. I couldn't eat it it was so tough.  The wedge salad and wine will have to serve as dinner tonight.  I shouldn't expect any more from a national chain--there are just so few choices in the Matthews/Mint Hill area. Tony's filet was no better--both ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"I'll give them another star because my most recent visit was more pleasant, even though this is still never going to be my choice of places to dine.  We were seated at a table with adequate space!  Also, I had the shrimp tacos from the happy hour menu, and can say that they were an excellent value for $5."}
{"text":"There were 9 yes 9 empty tables!! We waited for over an hour, at some point you just stay because you have waited so long! More people left and there were more open tables yet we weren't getting seated!! Once we got seated the server didn't show up for another 15 minutes Don't bother waiting....it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"my friend and I just got finished with are first meal, ever here this evening. everything was good the food was tasty. The drinks  were attended to. both of us were satisfied with over all feeling of the place. The staff were really good. 
I will go back again..."}
{"text":"Walked in the door it took 10 min, for someone to come up to the front. Then we would have to wait 10 to 15 min to get us a table, the place was empty. I would have preferred to be at a table and browse the menu since it was the first time. Definitely the last time as well."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  It's really gone downhill lately.  The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold.  I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more.  He brought it back STILL COLD.  I realize prime rib is best rare, but this guy just didn't get it.  Nice waitresses and free peanuts though."}
{"text":"The filet was good but the salmon was better! Surprising for a steakhouse. Kind of pricey but will probably return in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants and it's not because of the steak lol! 

We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. Our server Andrea was very attentive and nice. We had three kids with us so we ran thru the drinks pretty fast but she kept our drinks filled. 

We ordered the texa tonion and spicy chicken bites as appetizers...Delish!!!!!!

For the adult entrees we had the mushroom burger with the sweet potato and the soup/salad combo. There food is always good but the burger was a tad bit greasy. The kids had the Kraft Mac and cheese....they love it for some odd reason.

Overall, we were pretty satisfied with our lunch and the speedy service. We will always be regulars!"}
{"text":"He likes the hamburgers here, I love the potato soup! 5 stars for the food! I've always had consistently good food here which is why it's always our go to place. 
Things were going really well, we were seated immediately and drinks were served promptly. I must say the potato soup is always tops on my list if I don't feel like eating their most amazing and always perfectly prepared filet mignon. I digress, thoughts of filet do that to me. 
Anyway, the server was polite and friendly but then it turned a little weird, awkward, annoying and downright intrusive. 
Yes, my husband is in the Army, Congratulations, your husband, father, second cousin and your 99th cousin first removed also served in the Army. I applaud them and thank them for their service and appreciate you thanking my husband as well. Yes, he's done 5 tours in all the horrible places most people see on TV. NO, he DOES NOT want to talk about it. Yes, it would have been lovely to spend some quality time with him and enjoy our meal. That didn't happen because you wouldn't go away, you were like a bad rash that spread right before our eyes and I'm the one that started to itch. I was itching to find some bug spray to get you to drop to the floor immediately so we could spend some quality time together. 
So on top of the toppings added to the hamburger you apologized for and took responsibility for with a little \"oh, I'm sorry, that was my fault\" comment,  you totally stink as a server and I'll ask to NOT be seated in your section when I return. 
The food is always 5 star but the service aspect can't be overcome by servers like you that won't leave the table as we're continuing our meal and looking at you as we take bites of our food hoping you will realize it's time for you to walk away....this was by far the worst dining experience I've had in years!"}
{"text":"Ambience was fantastic. Food was average. Service was excellent. Would try it a second time."}
{"text":"I liked longhorn in the past but our last visit was the worst. We sent everything back except the wings! Finally we just said forget redoing it we'll pay for what we ate and go somewhere else. My rare steak was cook medium to medium well. My wife's prime rib was dry, no juices even on her plate. Her salad dressing tasted so strongly of vinegar it was inedible. The spaghetti squash was so bland and tasteless. Manager was cooking on the line not doing his job. So apparently the chef want there and the manage was cooking. Explains everything!"}
{"text":"The food was great but unfortunately, the service was horrible. Do not recommend if you have a party of 8 or more."}
{"text":"Great ribs...great service.  Good for small groups.  Parking is ample and spacious.  Good for celebrating."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. The decor, atmosphere, and food, were second to none.
You must try their Primetime Burger. By far, the best burger I have ever eaten. Also, orded a sweet potato instead of the fries at no additional cost. The server could not have been any nicer. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Consistent delicious food. Their meat taste as meat, and not as cardboard as it often happens elsewhere. We like to sit in the bar area (rarely we have to wait, unless we go during the weekend). Take your friends to this location if you want to hear them talking, which is always one of my pet peeves about restaurants. Never understood the need for loud music, but at this location you actually hear each other which is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. They seemed to be short staffed. They were out of the majority of sides and there was an obvious communication problem between the kitchen and wait staff. Our food arrived cold. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"I usually eat chicken or fish when I visit steakhouses.  Decided to eat a steak, ribeye. It was bland, it was tough, it was dry. I couldn't even make it halfway through. I was so disappointed that the main item this franchise specializes in isn't mastered. Side items were decent."}
{"text":"My favorite place for steak in Gaston County! Always delicious no matter which cut of steak you get. Salads are great, mashed potatoes are a favorite... Appetizer bread is amazing! Soup is good. Never had a bad experience. Yea you may have to wait some time for a table but it's good food, what do u expect :-)"}
{"text":"We only had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Friday night.   There is a bar but it's rather small in size and not much of a waiting area near the door. We ordered the \"Spicy Chicken Bites\" for an appetizer.. they were good.  They were like boneless small chicken wings in a spicy chili sauce.  Fun and perfect portion for two people to share. Renegade Sirloin with Prairie Dust.. 8 oz was good.  It was the perfect size for a meal. I like the menu options but just wish there were more side options.  Loaded baked potato and salad - just boring.  I really wanted the asparagus - which I saw was on the menu as a side when I looked at the menu online but when I inquired about it while ordering was told there was an \"up-charge\" for that??  This visit was lacking but still a good meal."}
{"text":"I went here with a fairly large group of people, about 12. The service was pretty good. I ordered the filet. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender but it was way too salty which is why my rating isn't higher. Everyone in the group who had steak commented on the saltiness."}
{"text":"I enjoy the ribs here, the drinks are great and they give you a decent amount for what you pay. Service staff is very polite. 

The only complaint I have is they run out of the prime rib early FAR too often. I think It's 5/7 times they've been out of it at dinner time. Also, the layout is also a bit open, but that's more of a preference thing. I like booths with walls in front and back a bit better."}
{"text":"For being in restaurant row at Metro Center not bad at all. We waited just a few minutes for a Saturday night. The food was really good and cooked to order. The service was really good and he was on top of it. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We live in San Diego and always try to eat at a Longhorn whenever we are near one. We have never been disappointed, love the decor, food and service."}
{"text":"Came in for a nice sit down meal with my grandparents before I went back to college in West Virginia which is a bit of a drive. Sat here for two hours while all the people around us whom got here after us got their food before us....I ordered a salad."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and after seeing all the commercials on TV and this being the closest to Southern California we decided to go. Let's just say from our drinks to our appetizer to dinner it was even better than the commercials show. The service was exception and so friendly the food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable for what we ordered. 
For once... This was something that all the hype we saw actually on TV was worth it. If you are in the area definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for my boyfriends graduation lunch. Called ahead and told them we were coming an hour before, when we got there they said they would sit it up. The only weird thing was the host commanded us too \"go sit down, its about to be a madhouse in here.\" Which was a little unprofessional. I've hosted for two and a half years before I served and never asked customers to move or sit down. Our server (a woman who's name started w a C, short hair) was awesome and fairly quick. The food was AWESOME. the other waiters congratulated my boyfriend and his parents and joked w our table and made the experience even better! I got the sirloin which isn't the bwstncut of steak but it was still delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Longhorn is at a marketplace disadvantage after discontinuing happy hour offerings. Flemings is a blue cheese-stuffed olive throw away.  And Outback.  And Roys. And Z Tejas. And, well everyone else in community."}
{"text":"Jus ate here. Food was good. I'm a guy though and pretty easy to please when it comes to red meat. The ambiance is good. Good for a date and doesn't necessarily lend itself to families with kids in a good way. To me the service was excellent because while we had to wait a while to get service, the manager came by and apologized and gave us coupons. Not bad because we weren't really waiting all that long. After that the service was good and the mgr came back at least one other time."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a small victory after chemo today. Strawberry Pecan Salad was awesome. Pretzels were great as well. Steak well...... Very tough. Just a question why does it take 5 people and a manager to run the host stand when no one is in line. Sounds like a great party I was invited to. These is terrible. Trying to have s nice dinner!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town and tried this place. We typically don't trust chain restaurants...especially chain steakhouses, haha, but this place was surprisingly great. The food was awesome and the service was quick and friendly. We had a great experience here"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, free bread and butter at the beginning of the meal - enjoyed the atmosphere. Free parking. I got the tilapia and shrimp entree, and no restaurant ever writes how many shrimp you get... They had four shrimp with a perfect tilapia. The others in my party had flat iron steaks and a ribeye. The 8oz ribeye looked great! The reason the restaurant got only four was the messy bathroom. Mints after dinner are hidden on a shelf near the hostess station. Would recommend to friends for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"We went here last week for my friend's birthday. There were four in our party, five counting my daughter. We all ordered steaks, though there are some tasty sounding seafood choices, as well as chops and ribs. I had to fight with myself over a strip or the ribs and ultimately chose the strip.

Two of us got filets, I got the strip and my father got the top sirloin. We all got salads with our meals as well as mini-loaves are dark bread. My father and I got the blue cheese dressing and its killer. Big chunks of blue cheese in the dressing. I could almost have eaten the dressing out of a bowl. Actually...I could have. Its that good (and I love blue cheese).

We also ordered the potato chips appetizer. You get a big platter of fresh-fried potato chips. They're thick cut and crispy...perfectly so. They're dusted in sea salt and comes with a BBQ ranch dressing.

We got our steaks. I was told that Longhorn is a place here in Pittsburgh where you can order a good Pittsburgh Rare, which I did so. Well they got the charred crust down pat. But I ended up getting a Pittsburgh Medium Rare. It was still good, though. The crust was salty, peppery and charred....slathered down with a creamy dollop of butter. Everyone else's steak was done perfectly. Two mid-rare filets and a medium sirloin.

My only complaint was my \"fully loaded\" baker was loaded with butter, sour cream, cheese and bacon bits. But there they were very skimpy with the toppings....even the butter and sour cream. There was literally only five or six bacon bits and about ten little strands of cheese. It really wasn't \"fully loaded\", more like \"kinda loaded\".

The service was slightly above average. The server and food runners were friendly and prompt. Nothing they did, though, really stood out. The manager came to check up on us, too, which is always nice. The only other complaint is that they sat four adults and a 2 year old on a regular 4-top table. We were all a bit cramped. I don't know why they didn't stick us at a bigger table. I'm not sure this place is the most kid-friendly.

All in all, we were all very satisfied. The steaks were all great. The prices are slightly above average but they won't break you. Aside from the cramped eating conditions, everything was well above the bar."}
{"text":"I have had 5 star experiences here and I have had too many 2 star.  The service is consistently great and the food is generally worth the price but the quality of the food and the preparation of the food leaves much to be desired. 

Let me start off by saying that this used to be the go-to steakhouse for my S.O. and I.  I tried Longhorn for lunch when it very first opened and was not impressed but gave it another go and was surprised at how great the steak was and the service. 

Fast forward 5 years and we are back to my original thought:  this place is not that great. 

The last three times that SO and I have went have been disappointing.  The range of visits were from January 2016 to last Thursday (April 21, 2016.)   

In January my hubby ordered a seasonal steak that came with a bordelaise sauce and  fried egg on top.  The egg was cooked to rubber ball consistency (requested over easy) and the bordelaise sauce tasted like a salisbury steak frozen dinner. The steak was cold and it was obvious it had sat out for awhile before making it to our table. It was not pleasant.  Lesson learned on trying something new.  No biggie.  Know not to order it again and to stick with the basics.  I had no complaints on my food, ribeye cooked rare.  The steak was great, warm, and seasoned. 

We tried again in March.  Again, the service was great.  Our 6 yoa was celebrating her birthday date with her dad and she was tickled that she got to drink Shirley Temples.  Our waitress was wonderful and kept checking on the birthday girl.  The food was .. meh.  Our appetizer of Wild West Shrimp was excellent and it's hard to screw up prepackaged salads.  The steaks?  They were okay.  Normally, the steaks here remind me of when we grill our own and that's why we liked coming here.  Fatty and full of flavour.  The ribeye I ordered was cooked great but it's hard to not cook a steak rare.  My husband also ordered a ribeye, medium rare, and it came out medium.  There was a hair in my daughters macaroni and cheese and the manager came over several times to apologize and took her meal off.  Okay, second not great experience but things happen.  No biggie. 

The third and last experience was this past Thursday.  The host acted bored and had the personality of a wet blanket.  Our waitress was great, as usual.  The food?  It was not good at all, not even meh.  It was like I gave my 6 yoa steaks and told her to cook them however she wanted.  Hubby's outlaw ribeye came out black on one side, burnt to a crisp yet still raw in the middle.  My ribeye looked like it had been exiled to a freezer in Siberia before being thrown on a grill.  It had no coloring and a beige steak is not that appetizing.   Hubby sent his back and it took about 25 minutes for them to bring him another one.  That had one little tiny piece of bone.  It was cooked fine but the long wait and the lack of presentation had ruined it.   The manager was good enough to take his steak off but this is the third time that we have had subpar food and there won't be a fourth. 

I am not sure if they have changed food vendors or the cooks just aren't upheld to standards but its sad when a formerly good steak place is now on par with the other meh steak places we have around here."}
{"text":"This place is great and down-to-earth the prices are very reasonable and the people that work there so friendly"}
{"text":"Tried lunch.  Salad over dressed. Sandwich missing sauce noted on menu. Service very slow given only three tables occupied.  Can't recommend."}
{"text":"A decidedly mixed experience.  The restaurant is comfortable and our server was pleasant enough.  

But the kitchen seemed disorganized and unable to provide the food as ordered.  My salad was not served with dressing on the side as I requested and was repeated back to me by the server.   Then, the side dishes were served on the incorrect entree plates (my sides were on someone else's plate, hers were on mine).

Another person in my party remarked to the server that the steaks in the menu pictures looked very heavily seasoned.  She explained that she is sensitive to black pepper,  so she asked the server if she could have hers seasoned with salt only.  The server said, \"of course.\"  But when the entrees arrived, her steak had clearly been heavily seasoned, just like everyone else's.  

Our server offered to have another steak prepared, and we appreciated this, but this would have forced one person in our party to eat after everyone else, and we had plans for after dinner, so she declined.  

Now for the strange part.  I deducted a star because the manager came over to explain that they cannot change the spices on the steaks because the GRILL is seasoned.  So which is it?  Should the server have advised that they are unable to season a steak with just salt?

The food that was prepared as requested was quite good.  But dinner was confusing and more stressful than it needed to be.  This is not fine dining by a long shot.  It's too bad.  Because this part of town could use a decent steakhouse."}
{"text":"one of  the best lunchtime experiences in a very long time!
The low-cal ( 500 or less calories) options are a real treat for those of us trying to watch our weight. They al consist of a protein and a side ( sirloin,filet,rainbow trout, etc) and they are prepared perfectly. Our server, Leilani, was one of the most skilled, friendly and organised servers I have ever encountered.
I heartily recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"never again will I come to this place first off I we sat there for 15 min before I had to get up to ask if we had a server finely she came over with a attitude know one told her that she had a table even thou the table in front of us was hers so she say us even that all the server walking around not one of then ask if we been helped and after that it was  wry rushed we got there  1 1/2 before they closed even the food wasn't very good the steaks had a weird smell and taste bake potato was hard not cooked all the way the best thing was the crab dip that I am tasty with out that this would of been one star  never agian"}
{"text":"... Well, THAT was disappointing! ...

We're no strangers to this place. We like to eat here because mostly the food is fine, the service is good, the atmosphere is cool, no problems.

But Wednesday night? I won't say the wheels came off, but the tires sure went flat. 

Begin with our server. Usually these guys are sharp, snappy, helpful, on the ball. Not this one. She seemed a little confused, as if her attention was elsewhere, And it took a couple of tries for her to get our simple order straight. 

Then, the food itself.  I asked for the Flat Iron Steak because it is usually delicious the way I like it prepared - \"black and blue,\" which is seared on the outside and rare on the inside. What arrived was kind of pink all the way around; \"appetizing\" is not the way I would describe it. 

My wife ordered either the Renegade or the Ribeye  - I don't remember which -  but as she cut her way through it, found there to be so much gristle that she had to leave half of it on her plate.

Granted, our server did offer to remake both of these, but by then it was late and not worth the trouble. 

Finally, I don't know what kind of decaf coffee they're serving there ...  but it would be nice if they could take a little of the turpentine flavor out of it. Once again, their decaf is usually acceptable. Not this time.

I'm hoping that this is a one-off bad evening, and doesn't indicate declining standards on the part of this location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Customer service is amazing and their food is to die for!! I always have salmon and am quite picky but theirs is amazing! I'm going to be bringing my picky boyfriend here for a steak dinner!"}
{"text":"OMG... why are the reviews of this place so low???  We have been in the restaurant business most of our lives( even owned a steakhouse in Central CA.) Hands down,  just had some of the best steaks EVER.  Had the New York, ribeye, filet mignon, and prime rib. All very very flavorful,  tender and cooked perfectly. The service was also impeccable. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Longhorn recently on a date night. I loved the bread that they start out with as an appetizer. We both got a New York steak wich were cooked perfectly. The meal came with a side I had a baked potato. The meal also came with a salad we both got the Caesar salad which were good but nothing special. The wait staff was very friendly..fast.. and attentive. I must say though the favorite part of my meal was the watermelon margarita wow that is an amazing drink. We really enjoyed our meal. It was a very good overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Steak was delicious husband order the huge rib eye steak rare perfect! Mine was medium rare.  This is our favorite steak house.  No more Texas Road House or Logan."}
{"text":"Worst Longhorn I've ever had the unfortunate experience of eating at. 

We went here after a funeral for a family member. They told our family they could accommodate all of us. They really can't handle large parties and shouldn't even try. 

Wait staff is nice enough but were understaffed for the large party. 

Three hours later we are trying to get our bills while I type this review. 

They haven't even offered a discount or free dessert or an apology. 

Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible experience.  I ordered a medium ribeye steak. The order came out twice very well done. I told the server and the manager, and both were neutral about the situation. I am extremely disappointed. I have also cancelled my 57 person Holiday party for my staff. It's a huge problem when a a steak house can not cook steak. There will be no next time for me."}
{"text":"4pm, Saturday after a Spring Training game, party of 5. At least a 45 min. wait to be seated. 5 empty tables that seat 6. We were told that there isn't enough servers to handle the customers. WTF? Is the manager that stupid that he can't anticipate that there is going to be a crowd??"}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends and the food was really good.  Yes, it is somewhat expensive but good none the less.

I had signed up on their website and received a coupon for a free appetizer.  We ordered the garlic shrimp and peppers.  It was awesome!  Some of the best shrimp I have had in a long time.  And they have a kick to them which made them all the better.

I ordered the grilled chicken and stuffed portabella mushroom with a loaded baked potato.  Both were really good.  The grilled chicken was perfect as far as flavor and very moist.  It had a mushroom sauce over it that was not too much or too little.  The flavors went together quite well.  The stuffed mushroom was tasty too.  This entree was only 12.99 only because it's chicken.  If you want a steak here it will cost you a lot more.  However, there are coupons usually in the newspaper or online for $4.00 off 2 entrees.  They did not put enough sour cream and butter on the potato but that was easily solved by asking my server to bring me extra.

I also like the decor of this place.  It has a lot of interesting pictures.  It was cow-boyish but yet had a certain elegance to it if that makes any sense.  I thought it felt comfortable. It was not too loud and the tables are not so close together that you can hear other peoples conversations.  Yes, I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Now this is a very expensive Steakhouse, but it is very much worth it. Longhorn Steakhouse is a very beautiful Steakhouse in my opinion, you can buy a steak that may seem expensive, but once you buy it you will get you taste why it's that much, but I do recommend getting water because a soda there is $3 and if you like splurging go here."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch as they are open. They have great lunch specials and good prices. Obviously due to lunch it's not as big as a dinner item but worth it none the less. Service was good and fast getting the food out. I would recommend coming here for lunch time."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5. Waited a little over an hour for our food that was delivered by a rude food runner. Then waited another 45 minutes for the check. The waitress said it was \"busy\" I'd hate to see this place actually busy."}
{"text":"I dined here with my family tonight for a couple of birthdays and I'm very pleased! We spend all of our big family events here and always enjoy it. We had a couple of issues but the staff went above and beyond to fix them. We ordered Wild West Shrimp and they were out, the manager, Marvin, made the appetizer himself to ensure that we got exactly what we wanted! After that, I ordered a burger well done that came out about medium. Our server Matt W fixed it immediately! He picked it up off the table, profusely apologized, and sent the manager over. Not only did they fix it, but they took it off the bill and provided me with a gift card. I was happy regardless, I'm not one to let a meal ruin my experience. But I will say I left very very happy and very appreciative of the staff at Longhorn. Just makes me and my family love it ever more!! We look forward to the next time we dine here! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I come down to Phoenix about once a month for work and I eat at this establishment when I'm here. Not only is the steak on point, but the employees do make a connection to their customers, which is something that I've witnessed numerous times. That family type of feel is something that is rare and appreciated especially in a big city."}
{"text":"Great food but a bit disorganized.  Food was tasty but waitress took forever to check on us.   Had to finally go find someone to bring our check."}
{"text":"I normally do not write about chains, but this one needs to wake up. After our party of four ordered our drinks they changed wait staff on us, the original one did not leave the restaurant. Our new waitress took our food order, no big deal. Our salads arrived, my son and I both ordered Caesar salads, they each had the cores of the romaine in them, you know...garbage. The bread arrived about 1 minute before the entrees. When the entrees arrived, there were 3, they had forgotten my wife's soup, she had ordered just soup and salad. They said they would be right back, 7 minutes later they arrived with her soup. How long does it take to ladle soup into a bowl ? Apparently 7 minutes ! All food should arrive at the same time.  The entrees were quite good, but the service is horrible. The restaurant was about half full on a Sunday night, during Christmas shopping season next to a huge shopping area. Now I know why. Going back there soon would be a Christmas miracle !"}
{"text":"The meat still had marks where the jockey was hitting it. Low grade dog food is a little better."}
{"text":"GREAT steaks, prepared just the way it was ordered. Highly recommend the Portabello mushroom steak. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"The food and service was good we had shrimp and french fries, but when I went to pay the gift certificate had a extra five dollar coupon with it and they told me I could not use it I was mad. I will not buy their gift cards for Christmas again because the coupon I thought it was a Five dollar gift card like all the other restaurants did but I was wrong."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, ordered a MR sirloin. It was too done for me, pink still, will order rare next time. Bar tender was great to talk to. Will be a place I coma. Back to regularly."}
{"text":"Don't go with a large group and the call ahead seating is a joke. After calling ahead we still waited over an hour and a half in the restaurant to be seated. Enough was enough as we were all starving when 8pm came and we were still being told \"we were next to be seated\". We left and will probably never return, the food court at the mall treated us nicely."}
{"text":"This was the first time eating here and my girlfriend and I realy enjoyed are food. I ordered lobster and steak and let me tell you it was awesome. I was impressed how the cook chose to throw out the first lobster do to he felt it was over cooked. The cook  also came to the table and made sure we where satisfied with the food which showed a lot about his love for the food he makes. After eating my delicious lobster and steak I got to experience for the first time fried cheese cake and ice cream and I will be coming back here to try more of the food for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished dinner at Longhorn Steakhouse near us.  The waiter was excellent, probably one of the most service oriented waiters that we had since dining there for many years.  I unfortunately did not get his name, but he was top notch.  He promptly asked what we wanted as far as drinks or cocktails go.  I had black coffee and my wife enjoyed a gin and tonic.  We ordered our meals and they came out promptly.  My wife had a 12 oz. Ribeye with a side of a baked potato and Parmesan creamed spinach.  I had the Flo's filet (6 oz.) and the Parmesan creamed spinach as well.  The steaks were done to perfection, and the parmesan creamed spinach was excellent, very flavorful.  I would not hesitate to order this again. I didn't bother to take pictures of our meal this time.  When the bill came I was a little taken aback as to the cost of our dinners.  (yes, I knew the prices of the steak dinners when ordering)  I just don't think that it was a good value for what we got.  We were  both charged extra for the creamed spinach, when that was the only side I had.  No bread nothing else.  I still took home half of my steak.  Which brings me to the topic of the take home containers.  They are a joke.  We put our steaks in two containers and we both had a hard time keeping them closed.  I mentioned this to our waiter and he said that they get that all the time,  The design is lousy. It will be a while before I go back there, if ever. I don't think there is value there for the money we spent.  I can go to an upscale restaurant and get better food at similar costs."}
{"text":"Came alone, guess servers hate that. It was 3pm I know slower time and I'll tip so serve me. Don't ignore me, not check on me, refill my drink, etc."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Longhorn Steakhouse before but the commercials looked good. I guess I am easily manipulated. Noticed that this location was finally open so I went a few weeks ago to check it out. After looking at some of the other reviews for this place I think I must have come on a good night or something because I thought it was pretty good. Much better than that \"Australian\" place across the street. Once again I realize that as far as steakhouses goes this pales in comparison to a real steakhouse. This is after all a corporate franchise. Still I thought it was pretty good. Food and service were great. Except for that damn clown that kept trying to steal my treasure.
When I walked in we were immediately greeted and shown to a table. Our server came over, I thing her name was Melissa I am horrible with names sometimes, she seemed very friendly and outgoing. She asked if we had been there before and we confessed we were noobs. So she explained how everything worked. Took our drink order and left us to look over the menu. Had to get some kind of steak of course. Settled on the Rancher's Sirloin with bacon, a sunny side up egg and bordelaise sauce. Ordered it med-rare of course. Hands off my treasure you stupid clown. The bread they served was nice and warm. Salad was good maybe just a little too much dressing. My only real compliant the whole night. Then the steak came out. It looked really good. Bacon and the egg all over it and a nice loaded baked potato. The steak knife they give with your meal wow. That is a real steak knife. Had some good weight to it. Definitely not a flimsy puny steak knife you get some other places. Now that stupid clown will leave me alone. I have a big knife.
Cutting into the steak, it was cooked darn near perfect. It had a great color. The meat by itself tasted great but with the bacon, egg and especially that bordelaise sauce knocked it up a few notches. I think I am in love with that sauce it was really good.
Overall I thought it was a good place. Nice decor, great service, never wanted for anything, more water, more drinks, more bread, they were right there. Food was good too. Now I know that a real steakhouse could trounce this place with both hands tied behind their back but for an everyday nice steak dinner out it is pretty good.
The other good thing was they caught that stupid clown. It turned out to be Mr. Alvin Jones in disguise trying to scare everyone off so he could buy the land really cheap and then sell it to the city at triple the cost for their new parking garage which his construction company had the contract to build. Boy if it weren't for those meddling kids. Now let's get some steak. Rah, ret's rall rav rum rake. Mmmmmmhehehehehe."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I use to come to this longhorn often in the past and always had a great experience but recently it's all just been terrible. Today I ordered a fruit tea and there was a dead fly in it.... then my steak was so tough that I had trouble trying to cut into it and I ordered it medium. My boyfriend's salad was drenched in so much ranch that he couldn't even take another bite. I never thought you could go wrong with mash potato but it was just so bland that I didn't even want to eat it anymore. We saw that this place was at a 3 star and we were both very confused as to why but because we really wanted steak we opt to ignore the reviews and go for it. We clearly made a big mistake."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here.  Everybody working here is very friendly and attentive.  Especially the manager James.  He really is focused on ensuring his customers are happy.

My Outlaw Ribeye was a little too rare for me, but once it was cooked a little longer, it was excellent.

I had the \"Perfect Margarita\" and it deserves it name.  It rocked!!!

Definitely give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, food was good service was really good.  People are so nice in Pittsburgh.  This is a chain restaurant so it was as expected.  Kids liked the kids menu.  Beers on tap a little weak (killed a star).  It was crowded but sit in the bar and you sit without waiting."}
{"text":"My first time coming here. I was meeting a friend here. The restaurant is clean & the hostess was nice and helpful. There was about a 15-20 wait it wasn't bad at all. Now when I get to my table. I was sitting for close to 7min. Before the server even acknowledged that I was there. Not like she couldn't see me.  Then she yells and says \" miss I'll be with you in a min\"  are you kidding me?! Easily could have brought me a glass of water and said \" I'm finishing up this table, I'll be right over\" Didn't happen! It took her another 10min to get to me!!  To bring me a water a couple min later, followed by a late drink being brought out. Mind you I have been sitting and waiting for over 20 min waiting to get water and a drink only!! The place was not packed at all.  I did see one party that was l my a table of 8  and they were finishing up about to go. Still she moved slow to me. Yet fast to the large table. Smh. My other party joined. Still down hill... They asked for a drink that was brought out minutes later and only half of it lol smh.. Then it takes her a few to get the rest of it. The main part. The shaker with the cocktail!!  Man I will not be coming g back here! My first time here and no questions about anything?? Just a know what you want ??!! Really? You need to retrain your servers!! Wow. Food came out late and not hot! Couldn't get a manager , couldn't find one! Couldn't get my server to come back because she couldn't be reached!! Oh but when one of us finished eating .. Our server was like would you like me to bring your check out!! Now didn't want dessert , yet you could have asked. Nah what was I thinking!! She hurried to bring out the check then stayed by the table waiting. Rude. Couldn't get you to do what was needed when it was needed. Yet your goj g to hover over us to get the check. Reach for it because you saw money being put in it. No go away. You were not good at all. Food was okay  yet not hot when it came out. Didn't like all of what was ordered. Will not be back to this place. First time & my last time!! My server moved slow, did not even try to cater to my table, was only fast when the check was dropped off and wanted to get the money. Sad.."}
{"text":"We eat here for lunch often.  Generally, the service is fantastic, and the food is always tasty.  I've had a number of things on the menu, and most everything is fantastic.

I was very impressed during our visit this afternoon.  To start, we had some very slow service.  We didn't have our appetizers until about 15 minutes after we ordered them, and the food came another 25 minutes after that.  Everything did finally come out, and once it did, all if it was cooked perfectly, still hot and very tasty.

Since we're frequent visitors, we didn't fuss about it much, since the service is usually much faster.  The reason I was so impressed was because the manager on duty personally came to our table and apologized, explained the slow service was due to a mistake in the kitchen, and offered to comp our meal entirely.  She then stopped by with some gift cards for our next visit.  To me, this more than made up for the unusual delay in our food, and showed us that the manager cares about her customers.  Delays and mistakes happen occasionally.  A restaurant really shows it's true colors when you see how those mistakes are dealt with.

As for the food itself, it's all very tasty and always cooked correctly.  My favorites are the Sirloin Chimichurri, Braised BBQ Beef, Primetime Burger, and the Oktoberfest Pretzel Sticks.

I will say that salt is used relatively heavily, and while I love garlic, the Parmesan Garlic fries are way too over seasoned (the one time I ordered them).  Also I'd avoid the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, as it's pretty smothered in cheese.  I ate all the chicken, and left the remaining cheese, and the server asked if I wanted a box to-go (since the cheese itself looked like most of the meal).

Also, please bring back the Crunchy Campfire Burger!  I miss it! :)"}
{"text":"Have been coming here a lot quite recently and still love it here. The service is delightful and food is amazing! Way better than outbacks. Will continue to go here :)"}
{"text":"Food.
Our meal was prepared to order, and it was tasty. I obviously have had better, but it wasn't bad at all for this kind of establishment. I had the flat iron and it came out the way I wanted it. The meal is quite small, but that is the way I prefer it. The dessert got praise even it I had a mere taste and I never really crave fruit desserts ever. 

Summary.
It's is a more family geared steakhouse and that comes with some drawback. But for what it is, it does alright. The atmosphere is nice, even if it clearly is a machine rather than a humble abode of the franchise owners. But as I said before, one knows this when one comes here - embrace it and there will be no real complaints. Not great, but not bad at all."}
{"text":"Love this place!  When family comes to town this is where we take them.  We always get for him: Napa Chicken with artichokes and mushrooms in wine sauce; and for her: Chicken/strawberry/blue cheese/pecan salad.  Both are out of this world!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Longhorn steakhouse and i have to say i loved my food! I did come here for lunch and I'm not much of a steak person in the afternoon so i decided to stick with chicken and it was perfect! The chicken was cooked perfectly and it had so much flavor. My friend who loves this restaurant ordered his usual steak and he loved his meal as well. I will most definitely be back and to try their steak."}
{"text":"Longhorn was the caterer for our New Years Eve Dinner at FatCats Dance Studio last night. O. M. G. That Napa Grilled Chicken is to die for. The steak was tender and delicious. The salad and dressing choices were wonderful. The bread tasted like it was fresh baked an hour before. 

You know, when you go to a catered event, especially on a Holiday weekend, you just don't expect much. My SO is a chef and he just kept saying, \"Wow.\" \"Dang, this is really good.\" \"Did you try that chicken?\" The best thing he said was that we will be going over to Longhorns on Cactus really soon for dinner. 

I should also add that the staff from Longhorns who gave up their New Year's Eve to party with us were excellent. They were cheery and very sweet. The portions were generous and we felt like it was the best decision FatCats could have made.

Bravo Longhorns! You have new fans!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain, but the Mentor Longhorn Steak House consistently serves up excellent food.  Last night my wife and I had another excellent meal there.  She had the always great Renegade steak and I had Prime Rib.  The Prime practically melted in my mouth.  Her steak was also excellent.  Service was also very good.  Never disappointed here."}
{"text":"The food was super yummy! I had the Filet and my boyfriend had the prime rib and they were both very good and very tender! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor as well. We were seated right away and we did not have to wait long for our drinks or our food. The waitress we had, however seemed to be a bit distracted and did not give us her full attention. She didn't even offer us some dessert like most servers do. Other than that, I really enjoyed myself and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Risotto was ice cold & filet overdone. Didn't refill our drinks. Informed server that risotto was cold & she removed it off my plate (with her hands, didn't have me hand it to her). She brought me another as I finished my overdone steak. Very disappointed in this meal & establishment."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back. There were six of us two from Arizona and four from Edmonton Alberta. With two teenagers in the group, hamburgers were ordered, of course. They raved about how tasty they were and found they had generous beat patty that was topped with a slice of prime rib. The lamb chops are the best I have ever had-just excellent and cooked to perfection. Service was very good, the general manager also stopped by to check-in on our satisfaction. Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service was HORRIBLE!  Our server left for multiple long periods of time and when we received a drink refill it seemed to be poured from another customer's cup ( AKA To-go cup).  After receiving the check our server said she would be back with our dessert. We continued to wait for dessert and she came back over and said, \"Did you need me?\" We probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I just love Longhorn :) but one day i would like to be able to have a dessert and not being stuffed already :)"}
{"text":"Longhorn Steakhouse is an awesome Place to go for a good steak but i experience once on my visit before on July 12,2012 where our waiter would seat my friend and i but never come back. No Hosts on duty at the time prior to arrival to welcome/greet us. we had to sit around and wait for our waiter to come and take our drink order then had to wait and extra five minutes for her to come back to take our meal order turns out we were given the wrong menu. 

   After that visit My friend and i walked out of that Place Not feeling good he had trout and i had the steak. The Next day i filed a complaint with management and let them know what happen and they did not seem to really care about anything that my friend and i got sick from their food i also have alert the managers of that place and they did not care who got sick.. 

     Make sure you becarful what you order and how you order if you don't feel good or something does not taste right please alert the managers ASAP."}
{"text":"I came in on Saturday night (2/4) for dinner with some friends. Let me just start off by saying that this establishment is gorgeous! I really love the bar area. We sat at a high top near the bar. Zach helped us. He made me the best mule I've ever had! It was made with bourbon. We got several appetizers but the cheese stuffed mushrooms were my favorite! I was in the mood for steak and Zach recommended the outlaw ribeye. IT WAS AMAZING! And cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a molten lava cake and banana cream pie. Also amazing. Despite such great food, my favorite part was the service. Zach was great. Very friendly, funny, knowledgeable and makes some darn good drinks! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Our food was good, our waitress was awesome BUT we did call ahead seating, they said no problem we should be able to seat you right away.. Well when we got there & checked in they said 10-20 minutes, FORTY FIVE minutes later we got seated. Multiple were seated ahead of us & to top it off we did not get any silverware until we went up to the hostess to ask! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm always greeted by a welcoming staff and grab a quick seat in the bar area were the service is upbeat and friendly. I usually get something off the low calorie menu which tastes great and is a fair portion for the calories it claims."}
{"text":"Love this place. The service was good and the food was great. I'm a steak lover and I would travel the distance to have a nice steak. I always get the New York Strip, and with other sides. For the most part, the cook(s) knows how to make it right.

The setting and ambiance is welcoming. This place has a feeling, lack of a better word, upscale than Texas Roadhouse (TR). Don't get me wrong, I love TR too. Between the two, this place has a slight edge over TR.

Go there went it's steady, not when it's crowded; ie, if you like to have a nice and relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Best food and service in a long time !! I had ribeye and shrimp it was amazing !! We will be back"}
{"text":"Food is alright, and that's the reason we revisit from time to time. But host in the front was definitely the worst. Allegedly \"5 min\" wait was actually 30 min, but still not got seated. The red-hair host rolled eyes on me. This was definitely the first time I saw a host do this :/"}
{"text":"They didn't get off to a good start but the finish was great!  We waited approximately 10 minutes on a Saturday night at about 7 pm.  After being seated and looking at the menu, we waited, and waited.  After about 15-20 minutes I asked the hostess about our server.  She came to our table right away and took our drink order.  Immediately another waitress stated they did not know what happened to our waitress but she would take care of us; She delivered as stated!  Prompt, attentive, pleasant, and she had to put up with my mother-n-law (explosive).  The meal was delivered as ordered and the steaks were really good!  The waitress handled  the situation very well as she was ripped on every time she came to the table (I wonder who did that).  Upon receiving the check, the manager paid for the entire meal.  Someone explosive still wasn't happy.  I will return simply for the service we received, but the food is pretty darn good as well.  I apologized to the waitress for how she was treated.  Her remark was refreshing; \"She is just feisty and that's okay.\"  Good job Amanda!  Finishing well should always be the goal!"}
{"text":"C'mon folks, w/all the great places to get a steak in the Charlotte area, from Longhorn pricing to high dollar steaks elsewhere, why is ANYONE going to Longhorn??...its never been more than an \"OK\" steakhouse at its best, and that locations glory days, so to speak, have been in its rearview mirror for probably 5+ years....."}
{"text":"Being apart of  the Darden company I knew what to expect which was great service. My family received just that. Ashley was our server and she was awesome. Our food was nice and hot and was on time. Thank you Longhorn family!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST flavored steak! Love their filets and specialty salads! The service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great steak!  Poor service.   

People go where they're invited... They come back where they're appreciated.  

Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ever since this location opened up, we go here instead of driving up to the Longhorn in Cranberry Township, farther North. This location produces consistently good food and service. We have never had to send back any steak due to errors in cooking. The servers are a bit more relaxed and confident in Cranberry, but they're certainly professional at this location. Cranberry is still my favorite, but there is absolutely nothing wrong to report with the McCandless locale, and Longhorn blows Outback out of the water menu to menu.

Visited December 2016"}
{"text":"The meal was okay cooks are lost in the Kitchen..Server was awesome.. Blazin Berry Sangria was awesome  The White Peach Sangria was too sweet.. The watermelon Margarita was the BEST"}
{"text":"One of the only places in Monroe that is reliable and tasty. I often get take out here for lunch. They have a yummy pepper steak salad that hits the spot. Employees are always friendly. My only complaint is that the service tends to be slow. I'm really not sure why. I'm often there before the the lunch rush, so I'm not sure what the hold up is. Still, I'll like it and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no point in doing call-ahead; got put on the list an hour+ prior to arriving, and still waited 50 minutes before being buzzed accidentally.   Needless to say our party went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been there three times this past yearand each time was better than the last.   Very good quality for a chain.  Companion that I went with this time thought his steak was awesome.   He was leery at first    Cooked perfectly.    Staff  have  always been friendly and professional.  The shrimp appetizer and the macaroni and cheese side were delicious.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Aweful!  After waiting for a very long time we received our appetizer and it wasn't even hot.  We told the server Cheyenne once we found her again. We told her we didn't want to push back our meal any longer because it was already taking to long. After a half hour we got our second appetizer and it was the same issue. At that point the manager came and told us it comes prepackaged and not fresh. They just fry it and add seasoning. We also told manager it was taking to long so he checked the kitchen and they hadn't even started our steaks yet.  Meanwhile, people around us are coming and going which led us to believe that our server Cheyenne was the problem with the timing.  She finally brought our salad about 2 minutes before our steak arrived. Once we received our food it was so salty!  We ask for a togo box 3 times before it came and once we put down the credit card it took another 20 minutes before she picked it up.  During this time she offered us another Coke but never brought it.  So the almost 2 hours to eat.  Prepackaged food. Salty food. Terrible server you can rest assured we will never go there again. Especially with Texas Roadhouse next door.  Fast service, good food and price is right."}
{"text":"Not the best service.  Steak cooked wrong, lacked flavor, long wait for a simple piece of cheesecake.   Maybe due to weekend however no excuse (Saturday).  Must do better.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Avoid it.  Horrible, horrible service. 
I do not think this location knows how to schedule its servers properly, lunch doesn't always start after 12, some of us need to each earlier. When 4 or 5 servers are coming in at noon ( i watched them walking in) , there is a problem, especially when there are customers waiting  and empty, clean tables inside.
 
My party of 4 arrived a 11:45, there was no line at all and the restaurant was half empty, we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, after another 10 minutes of waiting at the table  (it was now 12:10) we asked someone waiting on a table near us to take our drink order and for some bread. The server told us the bread \"came in frozen this morning and would be ready in 10 minutes or so\".  Serioiusly, there were probably only 8 other tables seated, how is this not ready at lunch time? Also, I saw another table near us that was being ignored get up and leave...smart! 

Once our drinks came, we finally got the manager over and asked for him to get someone to take our order, he then grabbed a different server to take our order. Once the meal arrived, we did get a good server who was actually nice and refilled our drinks.

Summary- Three servers, 1 attitudes, 1 hour and 20 minutes for lunch that consisted of half sandwiches and salads. Food was good, but not worth the trouble and frustration at all. There are plenty of other places right in the area to go. I had hoped for better."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly.  On my most recent visit the food was delicious.   Has been in many of my recent visits.  

It wasn't always.  I give 4 stars because I still remember having received a steak that seemed super glued together about a year ago...yuck.  

I've since only ordered chicken meals but my son reported that the new york strip steak he had recently was very good."}
{"text":"Yesterday, (Father's Day) was possibly the sixth time we have eaten at the Longhorn Steakhouse on 75th Ave., Phoenix. We were told it would be a fifteen to twenty-minute wait for a table. We were given a pager and we seated ourselves in the waiting area.  Within two to three minutes the pager went off, I brought it to the hostess thinking it was an error, to my surprise, the hostess informed me that our table was ready. The hostess showed us to our table and within minutes Shaley our friendly, smiling server was taking our drink orders.  Shaley quickly returned with our drinks which were soon followed by a second trip with freshly baked bread and asked if we were ready to order or if we need a little more time.  I told Shaley we were ready and she took our orders. We ordered two filets cooked medium, one with a side of baked potato and the other with a side of fire-grilled corn on the cob and an order of Redrock Grilled Shrimp with rice and broccoli. Shaley told us what our salad and dressing options were and took our salad orders. Shaley returned shortly with our salads and assured us that our dinner orders would be out soon. Our dinner orders were brought out shortly after we had finished out salads.  I mention this because I resent having my main course brought to the table to get cold while I'm still eating my salad. Nevertheless, considering how busy the restaurant was yesterday I would have overlooked this if it had occurred.  But, apparently, Shaley is dedicated to providing proper service regardless of how busy she is.  Shortly after our main course arrived Shaley returned to check if our orders were cooked to our satisfaction. Yes, they were; they were cooked to perfection!  When Shaley returned to check on us, I asked Shaley if her name would appear on the receipt. Shaley told me her name again and assured me her name would appear on the receipt. I told Shaley I was very impressed with her service and would be writing a review on Yelp and I would give her the credit she had earned. Sheley was visibly pleased and informed me that she was a new server who had previously been a hostess! As I mentioned at the start of this review, this was possibly the sixth time we have dined at this restaurant. We would not have continued returning if we weren't satisfied with the food and the service.  But yesterday was exceptional.  The restaurant was filled to capacity or close to capacity, the servers were moving so quickly, they were short of jogging between the kitchen and the tables, yet our service was flawless from the moment we spoke to the hostess to the moment we left the restaurant. I believe all the staff and in particular Shaley deserves to be commended for outstanding service under the most difficult conditions."}
{"text":"Pretty fair prices for excellent quality food and service. I would definitely go more often is there was one closer to me."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night at 7:45 the wait was about 40 mins, not too bad right.... Once we were seated the waiter came over pretty quickly and we all (party of 4) placed our orders immediately. Two steaks, salmon and shrimp. The wait for the food was a little over a hour!!!!! I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what. The manager moved about the restaurant slowly cleaning but definitely not managing. The only food related complaint was the Wild West shrimp. They were tiny!!!!! I wouldn't recommend the place but if you happen to think about having steak and you have time to waste maybe try it..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Parmesan crusted wood grilled corn on the cob.  The ear of corn had only one strip of Parmesan coating.  That part was delicious but I expected it on the whole ear.  I also ordered the creamed Spinach,  I would say that the creamed Spinach at Boston Market tasted better.
Husband order steak + sweet potato, both were very good"}
{"text":"The steak and appetizer were delicious!  It is a busy, busy place.  They servers were attentive and worked together to monitor our table. The price was good for the quality of food we received. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I have a date night every week just us no kid and its our time...So we try to pick a place that we have never been too, Longhorn just opened 6 weeks ago.

We got the 2 fer meal for 26$ and upgraded our steaks to Flo's Filet for an extra 6 bucks each. Let me tell you it was totally worth it!

Our steaks were perfectly cooked, we got them the same Med rare! Wife got the garlic mashed potatoes and I got the sweet potato tots...yum!

The service was perfect, Tracy our waiter was on it and was not pushy and took great of us. I was so impressed that I asked for the manager and told him what great food and service we received!

All in all if you like steak check this place out!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, we weren't greeted for at least 10 min after we arrived.  My order of prime rib was a huge chunk of fat. I sent it back, and received an equally as bad piece.  The manager came by and I expressed my displeasure and he was completely nonphased.  The boldy seasoned steak my partner had was done very well but way too much salt in the seasoning.  Not a great experience.  I've had better prime rib at the casino."}
{"text":"My date's take on this place was his 6oz cut was not worth the $21 bucks. But the service was great. Waitress was knowledgeable.
I had a very yummy margarita and my steak was cooked great."}
{"text":"Visited 12/7/13

Our visit on this day was extremely disappointing. From quality of food to the overall service there is nothing that stands out about our visit that would want to make me return. 

We went with a group of people celebrating a friends birthday.  As a result, the organizer had reservations for us.  A group of about 12-14 was scheduled.  I was very disappointed that with this planned reservation, the restaurant was only able to seat us when everyone arrived.  Thereby spoiling the potential surprise element of the party.  And the table arrangement had us seated at a long rectangle table next to a 6 foot round.  Looking around, I did notice other long tables (or square tables with folding leafs.)  So it is too bad that even with a reservation, this was the best table arrangement they could provide. 

Once seated, it was clear within about 5 minutes that the wait staff were out of their element.  The initial waitress introduced another who would be helping.  I am not sure if I really every saw the same two faces. 

They tried to take drink orders. I ordered a follow up beer to the one I got at the bar waiting to be seated.  This never showed up until halfway into my meal when I was asked if I wanted another. My response of course, \"I am still waiting for the one I ordered previously.\"  They brought an extra wine drink that originally we thought no one ever ordered. Only a few days later in the course of conversation did we figure out that the waitress brought it to the wrong person. Instead of figuring out where it needed to go, left sitting in front of the wrong person. And several people including myself ordered waters (which never managed to show up until well into the meal also.) Why a nice place like this just doesn't service water to begin with is beyond me?

The menu notes that meals are served with endless supply of the Honey Wheat Bread.  The table of 10 was given two baskets of bread. The loaves so small that they did not serve everyone at the table.  We never saw another basket, never had an offer from anyone to bring more and really never get a chance to flag a waitress down to request again. If it is endless, they that should be the case.  At minimum, at least make sure that the first round will service the whole table??  Seems like this, like water, should be something that is automatic??


My girlfriend and I both had soup. She had Broccoli Cheddar.  I had the Lobster/Shrimp Chowder.  In both cases, the soups were luke warm at best.  Taste was o.k.  But lost because it really was not a hot soup. 

I had the Porterhouse for 2 with girlfriend. 30 ounce with two sides and two salads. Also includes table side steak sauce.  Now I know that the meat is weight based precooked.  But I have a very hard time believing this was a 30 ounce.  And it was a very large bone so I know I paid for that more than meat.  It was cooked correctly, Medium.  But again, came out warm only.  It clearly had been sitting.  I also had similar comments from other people at the table.  Appears that maybe there was a problem timing the order of the table correctly??

Salads were a very basic house salad. Drenched in Ranch.  I had the Sweet Potato with butter and cinnamon sugar.  It was barely cooked and only barely warm.  It was hot at some point because all the butter melted and ran off - because it was not cooked enough to soak in.  Girlfriends bake potato did not taste baked - but microwaved.  And it was just barely warm also. 

We did not want to try dessert. After everything else, we were ready to leave. 

As a final kicker, one the people at our table actually expressed service concerns and issues to waitress and asked for a manager.  Manager came over and I overheard her expressing concerns about service and issues.  The gist of the conversation was \"thank you for letting us know.\"  No offer to discount, no free drink, no free dessert.  Nothing that would encourage me to want to come back again. 

A table of ten, this was at least a $300 sitting for the able. 

Overall, very disappointed.  There is nothing about my meal or experience that would have me return. There are many other steak places that I have had better experience at including the competitor that is just across the street from this location.  Further, given their lack of table options, would not recommend for a large group that cannot fit around a round or square table."}
{"text":"Arrived around 10 so a little late but not crazy. No waiting but the place was fairly  busy. Drink order was a little slow. Food came out fairly quickly and was prepared properly. My steak was very fatty but tasty. 
Awesome bread. Overall a nice place but texas Roadhouse is better and less expensive :)"}
{"text":"Longhorn is OK, not great or fantastic.  We have been there three times and have not been wowed.  Food = OK, Service = Good, Value= OK.  For the same price you can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not so good experience. New Year's Eve takeout was steak, potato, salad, mushrooms. Brought the New Year in with food poisoning! First time had steak medium. Now the steak tasted good but not sure if it was the food or someone not being clean? Was so sick ended up in emergency room. Won't be patronizing this particular restaurant. Had a feeling it was unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. The first time I ordered skewered shrimp, the second time I had Flo's Filet Mignon. Both the shrimp and the filet were pretty close to perfect. I don't eat steak often, but when I get a craving for one, I want it to be great, especially if it's somewhat pricy ($19 for a 6-ounce filet). The filet they served me was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. The chef went a little overboard on the pepper, but not enough that it hurt the dish. The shrimp I had on my first visit was also very good, seasoned wonderfully. I would purchase both entrees again.

Before I talk about the service, I should mention that I like going in the afternoon on the weekend, so I'm not going during a peak busy time. But both times I went, the service I received was superior to most restaurants. Food and drinks came quickly, the servers were friendly and helpful, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and even though it was a packed house the service was 1st class. Nicholas attended to all our needs and our evening was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been to this steak house a few of times. Each time we went we had good service. Nothing over the top but they were all polite and got our orders right and timely and took the time to answer any questions we had so I respect that. The food was always good as well. There was one time I thought my steak was too charred and dry and I don't usually like my meat that way, but my husband thought it tasted good. It could be the steak I chose too. Over all, every time we've gone (busy or not) the wait time isn't too long, the service is friendly and timely, and the food isn't too shabby. The bread they serve before your meal is TOO GOOD and taste healthy. We do eat at the Texas Roadhouse down the street from time to time. Roadhouse is a bit cheaper than Long Horn but my husband and I left the first time thinking well you get what you pay for. I think the food here was fresher and the atmosphere was better. Not too loud to where we have to yell across the table to enjoy a conversation. I say give it a try, you might like the a new fresh taste. The difference I feel when leaving here and roadhouse is here I feel like mmmm that was good lets go shop at target and when I leave roadhouse it's like man my stomach is feeling too stuffed, let's go home. I think that says something about food QUALITY when you're receiving the same QUANTITY!"}
{"text":"There was a male hostess and he made a good conversation when checking us in and while seating us! The wait was 15 minutes which they guessed. Anthony was our server and he made sure we had everything we needed. He was the best server I have had in a while! The food came out fast and was super fresh and full of flavor. Had the Wild West shrimp and it definitely had a kick with the jalapeños. The mashed potatoes where served with melted butter. The rib eye steak was a perfect medium rare but the Idaho potato was definitely not an Idaho potato. Prices are fair for the food portions!! Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all was there with a large party.  The waiter was GREAT!  Super friendly, sorry bud don't remember your name.... But place was FILTHY.  Food on the floor everywhere.  The food was typical chain."}
{"text":"Not good, long wait and food was cold. Was suprised they could mess up fries but they were dry and cold. Will wait for Black Angus next time."}
{"text":"Our server, Roger, was fantastic!!  He was super nice, friendly, and provided spot on service. The Parmesan chicken was good. A lot of cheese but good. My husband got the prime rib burger and enjoyed it.  When you go, ask for Roger."}
{"text":"Second time at this place,,,First time I thought it was over priced for portion size,that was dinner...this time it was lunch...OMG...Ugh, we sent back soup because the seafood in it tasted \"funny\"...ordered a 'lunch salad' at $15.99, geeze what a rip off...had a better salad at Pizza Hut the day before , and it was only $3.00...its just so damn overadvertized that people just flock there...I had better food at our local bowling alley...in the end we paid $44.00 dollars for LUNCH!!! This  is outa control!NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know.  Have steak at a steakhouse. But being the burger freaks that we are, had to try the burgers.  Awesome flavor, perfectly seaasoned. The honey wheat bread that comes with the meals was hot out of the oven. Excellent attenative service. Great job, folks!"}
{"text":"Thai place has great service I would say but after reading the other reviews  the food was definitely waaaaayyyyyy to salty."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Took 15 minutes to be seated in a restaurant only one fourth  full. Then another 15 minutes and not even an acknowledgement from the staff. Others that came in after us were waited on quickly. 30 minutes of my life and no food so we left and went to Texas Roadhouse down the street and got great service and great food."}
{"text":"Hostess was very nice. 
Sat at the bar, usually you get impeccable se4vice sitting there.
Took almost 5mins before being noticed and never by the other one. Received drink order and was able to order dinner in a timely matter.
Received food and had to find our own salt and pepper shakers.  Then almost done with steak and finally bartender comes to check on us...wanted a steak sauce. Then to wait on the bill.
You would think they were swamped being Saturday night at 9 but not really, 1/2 the bar empty."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here once before it was pretty good I had a burger and my husband had the NY strip. We are having a cheat week on our diet and we decided to order carry out today.We live close enough that everything was still warn when we got home. The spicy chicken bites were good and the sweet sauce they come with. The salad was a tad small...I would think lettuce would be something that would be given not so sparingly. My husband gas a rather tummy chicken tortilla soup. My husband once again got the strip...It was very well done (he ordered medium) I tried the filet also very very well done (I ordered medium also) it was so over that it was actually chewy and tough. I didn't know a filet could be tough. It looked more like the sirloin it was so thin. So not impressed. I'm thinking next time we will go across the street to outback. The good items don't out weigh the bad. With having so many steak houses in the immediate area as competition you would think they would step it up to keep or win their customers."}
{"text":"The Outlaw Ribeye  is to die for! Let's just hope they keep it up. They have been known to mess up a wet dream, let's all hope and pray \"NOT THIS TIME\""}
{"text":"First time going to longhorn. Food was delicious, and service was good."}
{"text":"Great food. Come early and hungry. Had a great big Prime Rib. And mmmmm mmm good. It does get busy"}
{"text":"i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....
My sweet tea wasn't sweet at all, which was UBER disappointing for me because I hadn't had sweet tea in 8 months because I moved up north...
My soup was alright - French Onion - pretty standard. 
My friend enjoyed his meal though so that was cool. But he wanted to satisfy a sweet tooth after his lunch and the server never suggested desert. He suggested everything else that we ddin't want but I guess he just gave up and figured we wouldn't want it anyway. 
Nothing great and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again..."}
{"text":"I'm tough... I am a huge critique.  If the food here does not come out right, they will ALWAYS make it right!!!  They even remove it from the bill if they can't get it right.  The manager (a large line backer looking black gentleman) is great!  He is polite and is on top of the employees.  We prefer to dine here over any of the other Longhorn's around.  You won't go wrong here... I have no idea where the other people ate who reviewed this place... because it couldn't have been here!"}
{"text":"We came here over Memorial weekend for a late lunch, early dinner. Lunch is served until 3 or 4 so that was awesome. We ordered off of the dinner menu though. The portions here are a good size and they have a big selection.

Our favorite thing to order here is the Porterhouse for 2. We were saddened to see that the steak sauce isn't made table side any more. I was looking forward to the smells and warm sauce. My daughter had a really juicy steak sandwich. She asked for the corn as a side and man was it good. Plenty of seasonings and butter. Lightly charred, but still sweet. The boys had mac n cheese off the kids menus.

Other than that, service was great. Our drinks were refilled without even asking. BIG Plus for thirsty patrons. Their bread they serve with the meals was really soft. The food came out at a good pace. And the salads with the meals were really fresh."}
{"text":"We had a really great meal. Our server was Tara. Very attentive, very good service. There aren't any of these restaurants in California so we were happy to try them out. It's silly to have a Black Angus and a Texas Roadhouse nearby. I will just say, we chose wisely. 

We ordered the Porterhouse Steak for two. We were going to eat later and didn't want to get too full since we were having a late lunch. The place was pretty empty around 3 p.m. Our steak was a little more cooked than I would have liked, I ordered medium-rare and like my meat to moo. It's okay. At least it wasn't overcooked. The steak sauce made table-side was tasty. We liked ours spicy. The kids burgers and steaks were also good. You might want to ask for condiments for the kids burger as it comes out dry without mayo or mustard. The portions were great and we left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"BAD STEAK!! You come here for a good steak and they can't get it right. I ordered a T-Bone Medium. They bring it out bleeding. I send it back and it comes out a little better. I sent it back and it comes out charred. Do yourself a favor. If you are going to spend close to 25 - 30 on a steak go somewhere that cares about quality."}
{"text":"After a busy day shopping at Westgate stopped here for  dinner.  It was really busy, but despite that we were seated in about 15 minutes.  There were a lot of people waiting for tables and seating was sparse.  Although I dislike waiting the food & customer service was excellent!  I ordered Grilled Lemon-Pepper Talapia and Shrimp.  Came with a side if rice and tossed salad.  The Peach Tea was flavorful and the serving size was large.  My hubby had Steak Diane with baked potato and salad.  Portions could have been a bit bigger."}
{"text":"This place needs to shut its doors! Horrible, bland, canned and pre-packaged food; nothing made from scratch. Menu photos look better than the actual food. Servers aren't very attentive and rush away from customers while they're talking to them, thus resulting in inaccurate orders. New cooks and better server training is needed. I won't be back!! Servers are friendly though."}
{"text":"Star doesn't have anything to do with food. Longhorn's menu is awesome and food is very good. This location has repeatedly poor service and is a reflection of their lack of good management and leadership. My husband and I used to go here 1-2 a week. Now that we have a child we carry out frequently. Let me rephrase we USED to...the past 2 years have gone completely downhill. I call in to place an order and wait on hold nobody ever picks up. So I call back in, they transfer me to a manager and still wait on hold for over 10 minutes (yes I was crazy to wait but I stayed on just to let them know I was no longer interested in ordering but gave up waiting!). The times we have gone in have mostly been long wait times and we are often comped due to poor service. We aren't there for comps we just want good quality dinner!!  It's sad because they used to be really good. We will have to go to medina to get our yummy longhorns since Strongsville isn't interested in keeping our business"}
{"text":"Ate here with mom on Sunday- They have an amazing special $12.99. Sirloin your choice of side, salad, an appetizer or dessert. I had the Caesar salad my choice of side was mashed potatoes and chose the dessert. I had the peanut jar.  omgoodness... a small piece of heaven. Waiter Tim was great and attentive. Place clean, wasn't too busy and great amount of food for price."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! The manager of this restaurant Tony could give some lessons on customer service. He made it a joyous dining experience. Our waiter, Cory, was great. It was a great experience and I would travel past all the other Longhorn restaurants just to go this one."}
{"text":"This restaurant is sub par compared to the finer steakhouses in the Valley. Bathrooms looked gross and the silverware we got were dirty. The onion appetizer was gross- definitely not the blooming onion. My filet was super small and little- and the Mac and cheese was nothing amazing. It's a good thing we had a gift card to use because I know I would have been really upset if I had spent my own money there."}
{"text":"I took my family out last night for my nephews 18th birthday. There were 9 of us, on a Saturday night, at 6:00 p.m. The dinner rush hour. Despite the time and the large number in our party, we were seated within 10-15 minutes and I was impressed.
Everyone in our party had some kind of 'special order.' 'Add this, skip that, rice pilaf not white rice,' etc. Regardless of the confusing orders, every one of us received our dinners EXACTLY as ordered. Again, I was impressed.
Problems were as followed; the steaks were over cooked and dry. The 'medium' steaks were DRY, irregardless of the description on the menu tht said 'juicy throughout.' There was absolutely no pink whatsoever in the steak and I believe, due to the over cooking, the steaks were somewhat tough.
Our waitress was good and kept our sodas and iced teas filled. She delivered our food as soon as it was available BUT the service was SLOW and my entire dinner was lukewarm, at best. It took forever to get the bread for the table and appetizers and our entire party was getting antsy because of the long wait. After the bread and appetizers, it took a while to get the salads. Simple salads. But at least we had had something to eat by the time the salads got there. Needless to say, the entrees and sides did not arrive any quicker.
The waitress brought the check, which I signed for, then flagged sown the waitress to have her ring us out. In hindsight, I definitely over tipped the waitress but that is what it is.
All in all, the company was great and made the dinner. I will not be rushing back to Longhorn anytime soon. In its entirety,  our half assed dinner took 2 hours and 45 minutes. Wow!"}
{"text":"It's not the best, and not the worse.  It is typical of this type of chain.  Dinner time is pretty busy, and it is a bit frustrating when others who I assume called ahead get seated before you.  So you may want to call prior to heading over.  

The atmosphere was nice.  It was nice to not leave there smelling like grease.  The cesar salad is pretty good and the croutons are made from the bread so it's light, crunchy and a bit sweet.  The steak was good, cooked just the way I ordered it.  We also had a chicken and portobello which was good.   The chicken was soft and and the sauce was tasty. I'll be going back again to try something else."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place as an alternative to Outback from time to time but after three visits I am afraid I will just stick with Outback.  The menus are similar but the prices are higher at Longhorn and the food is not very good.  Outbacks wine list is very varied, whereas, Longhorn has a very limited wine list.  On our last visit my husband ordered the sirloin steak which was overdone and tough.  His Caesar salad consisted of wimpy lettuce -- awful.  I had the prime rib sandwich and it was almost too salty to eat but the baked potato was good.  Our son had the prime rib which he said did not have much flavor and did not come with au jus (never had that before with prime rib).  Our server was attentive but the service was slow.  There were alot of diners there that night.  After three disappointing meals we are done with Longhorn."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every week. The experiences of most of the times are good. However, some times the same order is  made different from how they are usually made. And when this happens, it's usually pretty bad."}
{"text":"Not bad, but on the expensive side...   Had the steak sandwich, which was pretty good.  Beer was cold.  But like I said this place isn't cheap for just basic grilled steak.   
Waitress was cool, but she kept trying to emphasis that she was pregnant..  I dunno why, maybe in hopes of getting a bigger tip.."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks & family friendly!  Excellent salads, steaks, chicken, fish!  Excellent service every time!  Love it!"}
{"text":"We came down from Prescott for my birthday and thought we would try this out for my birthday dinner.  I was very pleased with the service and the food.  My steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned great.  My wife had the parmesan chicken it was great. My daughter and her husband ordered steak, they overcooked her steak but it was still very tender.  I really liked the food here.  Next time I'm in town for an event I'll eat here again.  great steaks.  Too bad there is nothing like this in Prescott."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better salmon. I know...its a steakhouse, however, they make the BEST salmon. I highly recommend this restraunt. We did have to wait longer than expected, however, they offered 2 free appetizers for our extended wait. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Parmesan fries were to die for!
Onion soup excellent!
Service was very good, Great menu so much to choose from...and raspberry lemonade !"}
{"text":"Wife and I had a late Easter supper. She loved her meal. My steak was cold. My mashed potatoes were cool. Our bread was cold. The spinach thing was the best of the meal as far as I'm concerned.  Ole
 New review. Wife and I are here again. The food is a lot better and our waitress Stephanie was great.  She made out visit wonderful. My coffee was kept hot and full. Wife's sweet tea always full. Wonderful experience. Ole"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the best Porterhouse steak I've had from a mid-line chain Steakhouse in a very long time.  The one I had tonight was way better than the previous two that I've recently had from local competition.  Everything was served up promptly.  My waitress was nice, and the food fortunately surpassed my expectations!  Caught them on a relatively quiet night, so everything was quite plesant tonight.  Would definitely recommend this location in the far west valley."}
{"text":"The food can't be faulted. It's the poor disgusting service. What a shame. I blame the management. You appear to have failed in reminding and enforcing to your staff that customers need to feel that they are welcome there and not a burden. It took nearly 5 mins for someone at the bar to even say hello or smile and acknowledge our presence. When they finally did, they just barked \"what can I get you to drink?\" No HELLO, no smile no welcome no MENU, nothing!  I had to greet them and ask for a menu and then of course I never saw them come back for another 15 mins.  Nice.  I was already starving and now i was totally disappointed. 

At the end of my meal? I was given a check without so much as being asked if I would like any desert. Did I want a desert? Yes. I wanted to at least look. But frankly by then, I just wanted out of there. It's shameful. That place has good food. The wait staff has no idea that even when you are busy, you MUST at least smile? Say hello? Or that they will be with us in a few? Come on!"}
{"text":"The best  Outlaw steak, delicious  spicy  shrimp, awesome desert. 
Large variety of good food, frendly staff, fast service."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed to walk in to Longhorn and find out they did away with happy hour. My wife and I were visiting this establishment every two weeks or so and usually spent between $45 _$65. Great service especially from the lady behind the bar ( red hair) you know who she is. We had not gone there for about 8 weeks. The happy hour was the draw to bring us there, and now it will keep us from there. This may seem trivial to some, but not all im guessing. I am not saying not to go there , but you wont find us going any longer. Thanks for the vent...thunder joe"}
{"text":"Good steak and very friendly nice staff ! The veggie sides are super fresh and taste great"}
{"text":"I am a very frequent customer at this location of LongHorn. I order takeout probably 4 times a month from there at least. My favorite dish to get is the salmon- very delicious. It is one of the more expensive dishes here. However, I always request that I do not receive and end piece or a tail piece of the salmon. The last two times I have ordered the salmon and given them the directions of not giving me a tail piece- they have given me a tail piece. I may be picky but I won't eat it. If you want something done correctly or to your liking you need to really spell it out here. Unlike the takeout, the service while dining in is very good and they accommodate their customers well."}
{"text":"LongHorn Steakhouse - 5 stars

Location/Parking: Conveniently located on Bell Road just west of Litchfield Road in Surprise. Easy access in and out and plenty of parking.

Atmosphere: Casual and laid back. Nice décor. Relaxed and unrushed environment.

Cleanliness: No issues. Clean glasses and silverware. Bar counter and tabletops were tidy.

Service: Outstanding. We were greeted with a smile when we entered and we were asked if we wanted a table or to sit in the bar. We chose the bar (shocking). It was 4:30 on a Wednesday so it wasn't overly crowded and we pretty much had the bar to ourselves. Our bartender was John and he was totally cool. We got our drinks and water right away while we looked over the happy hour menu. He answered all of our questions and made several excellent recommendations.

Food/Drinks: We had the house Cabernet, a very drinkable little number for just $4. We tried the Shrimp & Avocado Stack ($5) and the Spicy Chicken Bites ($4). Both were really good and I would order them again. In fact, we did order a second plate of the Spicy Chicken Bites. Yep. I would have licked the plate clean had the bartender not been within visual range. We didn't have time to try an actual entrée but the apps we had were worth a 5-star rating.

Happy Hour: Decent happy hour menu selection. Available Monday-Friday 4-7pm. $5 cosmos/margaritas/mojitos/martinis, $4 house wines, and $3 pint draft beers.

Price: Reasonable. Nice enough to take a date on Friday night but not so ritzy that you have to change out of your jeans.

Note: I heard that when the place first opened in spring 2013, the lines were long and the wait was ridiculous. Many people were unhappy and miserable by the time they got seated. Keep in mind that has an impact on the review. If you came to LongHorn in spring 2013 when they first opened and were disappointed, please give them another try. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit last night and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"We are repeat customers here.  The steaks are consistently cooked correctly as ordered (medium).  The salad and baked potato were good.  The sweet potato was great.  Great attentive service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I travel for business...  a lot!!  I've been to Longhorn before back on the east coast, never had a problem.  I stopped by this location since they were new in the area, and because I had finished up a job nearby.  I went in at 5 PM on a Saturday afternoon, not realizing that it was Valentine's Weekend.  There were about 40 people in the lobby/waiting/foyer area.  I spoke to the host, he assured me it would be about 25 minutes until they could seat me.  I waited... and waited, the pager that they had given me did not go off.  I had an appointment at 6:30, so at 5:45 I went to the host stand to check on how long it would be and to turn the pager in.  They said they had called me, and I waved the pager and said that it had never gone off nor had I heard them call my name.  There was no apology, nor anything offered.  This is very bad business, even poorer service, and it's just the type of thing that killed Lonestar when they were in business here in the valley.  I've contacted the corporate office, but no word back yet, I'll keep you posted on what they did or did not do."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and each experience has been great. Our last visit was on a Thursday night. It was about an hour until close so we were just going to get an appetizer and dessert. They assured us we weren't going to be rushed though because a huge graduation party was coming in at 930pm! Despite the big party our server never forgot us and even helped his coworkers set their tables up. I hope they all were tipped big for all that work, I believe we counted about 20 people. Great service and even greater workers.
As for the food, the dessert was wonderful and so was the crab dip appetizer. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my second time to this location and we went with a group of 11 on a Friday night for a friend's birthday.  We had called ahead to be there at 6:30...and we weren't seated until 7:15?  Not sure what the purpose was to call ahead, but nonetheless we were all together and each side of the table had their own waitstaff which seemed to keep the flow going well.

There was a wide variation of items ordered from the 2 for $29.95 menu where you can choose an appetizer or dessert, a salad and an entree.  My fiance and I ordered the Portabello Chicken with vegetables and the 8oz steak.  Mine was okay, not the best chicken I've ever had and the zucchini was barely cooked.  His steak was overcooked or they switched it with the birthday boy's whose was undercooked? They made it right and he was pleased with the flavor and tenderness.  We started with the firecracker chicken wraps which were flavorful and the avocado dipping sauce was quite good.  We added dessert since he was craving Key Lime Pie, but it was disappointing with not much flavor, definitely not tart enough and not worth the calories in my opinion.

The manager brought out sampler platters of desserts for the others because of the wait time and the screw ups in the orders...which was a nice touch.  I sampled the cheesecake (pretty good) the chocolate cake (good but not quite rich enough) but I didn't get to taste the apple crisp which looked really good.

Good place for a group if you don't mind the wait, food was as expected I suppose for a chain restaurant.  Thank goodness we had a gift card...kind of made it all better :)"}
{"text":"Had a gift card for here, Was better than I expected. Still not my go to for a steak house but for the price I left pretty satisfied. Pretty good staff!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and service. Everything is so yummy and delicious. Best sweet tea with peach ever too."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. If you want a good steak, go somewhere else. It took 10 minutes before our drink order was taken, another 7 before we got our drinks and another 5 before a different waiter brought us bread. Food wasn't bad or anything but not outstanding either for the prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always tender, delicious, and pefectly cooked and service is on point!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Wonderful service. My parents and I all got the special and enjoyed great salads, tasty appetizers and perfectly cooked steaks. I have been to many \"fancier\" restaurants in the past few weeks and my meal at Longhorn was by far the best!!!"}
{"text":"We've visited several Longhorn locations, with this location being our first visit last night.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed.  We did arrive around the dinner rush, about 5:30pm, so we knew our server was busy.  However, even though it was busy, it felt like we were somewhat ignored due to other bigger tables and other customers.  We waited quite a long time for our food arrive, yet our server ran past our table so quickly we never had a chance to ask him to check on it (and he never checked-in to let us know how much longer it would be).  During the time waiting for our food, I was sitting with an empty water glass and my husband waited for his beer for about 15 minutes.  Once we received our food, it was average at best.  The steak was overcooked, which probably could've happened from sitting under the warming lamps waiting to be picked up or just being cooked too much.  You would think spending $65 plus dollars on a meal, you would receive better service and better cooked food, especially steak.  Although our server was friendly, he wasn't attentive to us, didn't offer any apology for the food or drinks taking so long, and never asked how our meal was.  Although we have always enjoyed our meals at Longhorn, we won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Rarely do I leave a restaurant feeling thoroughly abused. Saturday afternoon, sparse crowd, seems like good time to get quick and attentive service.  Wrong. Waitress sat down in our booth to take our order, taking the moment to clean her nose. And it only got worse. Salads arrived with entrees, steak was barely warm. Had to chase down waitress to get the check, and then finally there was no itemized copy if the bill returned with my card. 
Close to home, used to be a regular.  Never again."}
{"text":"My wife and stopped here after the movies. We had the French onion soup and chili to start. My wife said the French onion was below average and my chili was runny. It had good flavor though. We each got the renegade steak and added the Parmesan crust. The steaks were cooked how we asked, medium and medium well. The Parmesan was barely melted. Needed another minute under the broiler. The service was extremely, extremely slow!!! The food would have been 3 stars but with service, we would not come back to the waterfront long horn"}
{"text":"We used to visit this location 2-3 times a week and always enjoyed our experience, but we have noticed in the last few months that the quality of service has been lax to say the least.. it's become a regular thing for us to be seated at a table then not be greeted by a server for 10-12 minutes and there have been multiple times where we have had to go back to the host stand to find out what the problem was. Once we finally get a server it's an unusually long time before we received drinks and once we do get them we are halfway through our meal before we see the server again. The food is always wonderful and that is what keeps us coming back. We were in the store tonight and chose to sit in the lounge because there were two large parties in the dining room and we just wanted to be a little more quiet, our server we have had more than once and always enjoy her but again we could tell she was struggling to keep up with her bar guests as well as her tables. We defiantly took into account the amount of people in the restaurant and seemed to be greeted quickly but then we had trouble getting her attention again after drinks and bread were served as we ate we noticed the manager behind the bar talking to some guests who appeared to be former employees she stayed behind the bar at least 15 minutes and then soon after was on the other side of the bar leaning on a chair chatting with them the entire time we were there. Our server was clearly working hard and had a lot of people to take care of and the manager was too busy socializing to notice or even help her servers out in any way. That is very frustrating to see when I know first hand from working in the I industry how my server was feeling being that busy and not having help from a manager who is standing there watching her struggle and not doing anything to help. 
We finished eating and I walked to the bar to pay and when we left the Manager was still in the same spot she was when we got there. 
I appreciate our server Malaz she was pleasant and kind but I know she could've been more attentive with a little help. 
Overall it's one of our top picks to eat in the area but we've been disappointed multiple times recently and haven't visited Longhorn as often as a result. 
Thank you Malaz for always being so sweet! We know you were working hard!"}
{"text":"The only reason I went with my wife was because their management sent me a gift card as a sorry note because one of their waiting staff mistreated us at another restaurant location.

Really convenient location right next to the mall, which I think is why this place does OK. Place was packed at 7 PM, but the service was great - we were immediately seated, got our drinks (and timely refills) and our food was brought out in a timely fashion as well. Overall a very decent experience.

The reason for the 3 star experience is not because I'm docking this particular restaurant for doing something wrong, but instead rating this restaurant compared to the other Steakhouses I've dined at. This place is average at best."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was yummy! For $12.99 I had a 6oz steak, mashed potatoes, chili cheese fries and a potato soup (up charge for the soup) 
The food was really good and the steak was cooked perfectly! Our waitress was really attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.
This was my first visit here but definitely not my last. 
Oh and if you sign up on their website you'll get a free appetizer coupon sent to your email right awayyyyy!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, not stellar, but don't sit at the bar if Rita is tending bar. My prime rib wasn't seasoned at all and neither were the mashed potatoes. Dinner came out quick, but I realized later we never received our bread. Lackluster food and service."}
{"text":"Completely uncaring about the customer and matching attitudes would describe this chain of Longhorn.  The bartender there all the nights I was there from out of town had the worst attitude.  He never smiled, he seemed irritated to wait on me and would finish his personal conversations before doing his work..like serving people.  We only went back cause the weather was horrible and it was close to the hotel.  If I go back, I'll never darken those doors."}
{"text":"We had a great time!

The lemonade was wonderful, and had a puree in it.  It was a real treat.

All four of us had steak, it was good, but mine was a little spicy.  It was nice to have a choice of what side I wanted. The salad was fresh.  The service was great, the food was great.  The facility was clean and nice.  It was everything we wanted for a great lunch.  Prices were reasonable too.

I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"It's a very nice restaurant for steak etc.  Their service was great and the food was ok but I prefer Texas Roadhouse"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. The service was outstanding and the ribeye steak was cooked to perfection! Their seasonings are right on point and the portions are a perfect size for a good appetite. I had such a taste for steak and Longhorn did not disappoint!! 

Great food and comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"The staff here are excellent and the food is decent. The service is generally quick and the prices are right in line with others that are similar to it. My personal recommendation is to order a salad- I like the chicken Caesar- or a sandwich. That seems to be what they're best at."}
{"text":"Friday night - 4 people - 8:30 pm

It was relatively packed. Our table ordered 3 drinks - a beer, whiskey, and mojito. The mojito was strong with simple syrup and not rum - not worth the 6.75. For entrees: prime rib + rice pilaf, filet + green beans, renagade top siroloin + loaded baked potato, filet + lobster tail + mixed vegetables.

Summary: Entrees were salty and the filet was anything but legendary. The meat consistancy was mushy and flavorless. For $100+ save your money."}
{"text":"Even though my only visit to this location was for a Yelp Elite event, I just have to commend the servers and managers again for their service! 

All the servers and hosts were super friendly and very knowledgable!!! 

I ordered the filet, medium well, and it actually came out prepared exactly as I ordered. Very tender and juicy! Yum! The sauce they make table side is excellent with the steak! 

If you have room left, get the chocolate stampede dessert. It's ridiculously good! But what's not to love about chocolate cake and ice cream?!?!? 

Everyone here seemed really focused on making sure the customer experience from beginning to end was great! I appreciated that and definitely took notice. 

If I'm ever all the way in Huntersville again, I would visit here again."}
{"text":"oh boy dont know where to start, went for father's day and it was awful,  order steak but it was burned and the chef send it out anyways, table of 4, 3 meals came out and the 4th meal came out 30minutes after everyone was almost done so I just ask for it to go, ordered a soup that never came out and no fork, drinks were not refill for 40 minutes and all food was not up to par. good thing manager comp the steak and offer to cook another one but we had enough so didnt want another steak after been there for almost 2 hours. wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the restaurant. I had passed it countless times either on the bus or just driving by.  For a Friday at the Waterfront, it was expectedly busy. We were given a 45 minute wait time, which again was not bad. We were waiting maybe 10 minutes when a hostess asked if anyone minded sitting at a high-topped table in the bar area. My husband and I definitely did not mind. We both ordered the Renegade sirloin with a loaded baked potato and caesar salad. 
Our drinks, blended strawberry daquiri for me and iced tea for him arrived with the most yummo honey-wheat bread that was soft and warm. The salads were the perfect before-dinner sized. They were not overdressed in Green Goddess dressing and had fresh shaved parmesan flakes on top. Our steaks were definitely cooked to order and the runner who brought them out stayed to make sure we cut into them to confirm they were done to our preference. They needed no sauce like some chain restaurant steaks. The loaded potatoes were of the right size to be filling without being too much. With both dinners and my two daquiris, the bill was under $60. We both walked away satisfied. Leah was a great waitress! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Food was absolutely hot and fresh. I sat at the bar and Sarah was amazing! I definitely recommend this location, and sit at the bar and let Sarah take care of you!"}
{"text":"Started off bad - we waited 45+ minutes (after we were told that it would be a 25 minute wait). So 6:50 showtime turned into getting seated after 7:30 pm. After the waitress made it to us, we ordered our drinks, appetizer and meal all at once (since we had so much time to peruse the menu while waiting to be seated.) The drinks were promptly delivered - as was the appetizer which was a group of tasty, spicy chicken quesadilla \"burritos\".  From there it went downhill:

1.  My wife ordered coffee. Besides not even offering cream or a spoon to stir the aforementioned non-existent cream and/or sugar, the waitress neglected to even attempt to offer a refill for the entire meal (it was almost empty from about half-way through the meal on.) My own beverage was refilled satisfactorily. 

2.  After the appetizer plate was taken away, we waited an abnormally long time waiting for our salads (15-20 minutes). They did come; after the main entrees were brought and I asked why we hadn't gotten our salads. Our waitress made some excuse that basically blamed it on \"them\" not bringing out our salads. I assume the \"them\" was the same individual who brought out our appetizer. Sorry, but I think that the waiter/waitress should be responsible to check on her guests and make sure that they receive what they ordered.

3.   The manager was an empty \"suit\". He walked around the restaurant, passing by us a few times without even bothering to make eye contact. I did see him chatting it up with some other patrons at the bar but not once did he make an attempt to ask how our meal was. 

So, we ate our salads and packed our steaks to go - we simply weren't hungry anymore since the appetizer, bread had filled us up, especially after we ate the salads. We left no tip. This is the first time that either my wife or I have failed to leave a tip-EVER after dining-in. I stand by my 2-star review since the food tasted good - at least the cooks  seemed to be on the ball. This is the second and last time we've eaten at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife & I visited this particular Longhorn on a Friday night. We only waited a few minutes to get a table. We didn't expect $40 steaks for $20 but what we did get was just fine for what we paid. If you're expecting gourmet food go elsewhere. This is chain restaurant fare. We knew this going in & ended up having a decent meal, decently priced. Our server was polite and accommodating. Service was quick. Strangely they only had ONE prime rib left at 8pm!!  We paid $35 for a ribeye & the lone prime rib. 
Bottom line, nothing special but more than met our expectations for a franchise restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum!! I love Longhorn. Tonight's dinner was probably one of the best ive had here. 
We were immediately welcomed by our server which is always a plus rather than awkwardly sitting there without food or drink. We had the new appetizer firecracker chicken thing and man was it good. Then we had the typical steak. Spend a little extra and get flo's filet it's so gooo! 
This place is so good for the price. The meat is so tender and juicy. We had an app, two drinks each and two steaks all for a little over $100 after tip. Can't beat that!
The drinks were great, the service was stellar and the steak was heaven. I love steak and Longhorn is a great place to go without breaking the bank!
Can't wait to come here in a few weeks to get another bloody piece of meat!"}
{"text":"If there was a rating of 0 then this experience would meet that expectation. Our family of 17 has visited this location on MULTIPLE occasions. The food is always satisfying but their service could use some work. It always takes 10 mins for us to receive our drinks and about 30 to be served bread and have our orders taken. Idk if they assume that since we are a large party we like the extra time, but we always come prepared knowing what we would like and would love it they would be a little more attentive, especially in such a small restaurant. Tonight we came here as a last resort, and will not return unless under the same circumstance.

Update: another 10 minutes and we still have not received our drinks ?"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse ! We are from Texas and this place is off the charts good! Our waitress, Lisa , was the best waitress we have ever had. The calamari was the best we have ever had and the steaks were delicious. Excellent experience. We will definitely look forward to coming back here !!!  Thank You !!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was right after it opened. For some reason I did not like the food. 

I gave it another chance a few months later and it went fine. 

I recently came here for lunch and it was great. Our server was on top of everything. I had the Parmesan crusted asparagus (I've had it before) and it was delicious as usual. 

My friend had steak and rice pilaf. I had the rancher's burger. Everything was good and service was great."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was one of my better dining experiences recently. The atmosphere they've created after the fire is beautiful. Very clean with very nice staff, off to a fantastic start! 

We got some sort of shrimp starter, it was supposed to be spicy but it really wasn't, it did come with peppers though. The shrimp was so amazing though, they just burst with flavor with every bite. Delicious!
 
I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with Mac n cheese and fries. The flavor was just magnificent. The macaroni was a little bit rich and made me sick later, but it was worth it at the time. 

My mom ordered a burger that was really divine. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meal. They brought out a dessert free of charge when they heard us mention my grandpas birthday. It was really sweet of them.

 I look forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Be sure to order the mushroom appetizer they are awesome every time we eat here.  Justin the bartender does a great job.  Past two visits split the outlaw ribeye and took  doggie bag home.  Great flavor and tender (almost able to cut with a fork)."}
{"text":"Delicious meal. Excellent service. If you are stuck in a traffic jam on 85 like we were, and you need to pull over for a while, you should definitely stop and eat here."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner tonight. Prompt seating and service. Graham our waiter was very courteous, patient and efficient. My husband loves the calamari even more with the spicy sauce ON THE SIDE. My half rack of ribs was fall off the bone tender and a generous portion. The ribeye my husband ordered  was cooked perfectly and he was so impressed with the spice rub. Graham told 7us that we could purchase this spice mix called \"prairie dust\" which we did. Cant wait to try it on our grilled meats at home. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Such good cuts of meat for the price and most of the sides are excellent, too. The drinks are wonderful--try the berry margarita served tableside--refreshing and enough for two. The chocolate avalanche dessert is amazing and inexpensive. It easily serves 4. 
No reservations but they do call ahead seating. The complementary dinner bread is always hot and fresh. 
The place is very clean and western-themed but in a classy fashion. Also, I have witnessed their level of cleanliness---they sanitize each table between customers. They don't just wipe the table down with a dirty rag like some places do."}
{"text":"Went out with daughter for lunch and had great meal and service.  We ordered a Outlaw steak to split and each a different potato as a side-meal came with a extra plate and they didn't even charge for second side!  Food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"first time at this location, normally go to Solon or Independence - this one is so worth the drive.  Everything was better, service AND food, just wonderful - forgot how good a steak CAN be.  LOVED it, will go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Brandon was very attentive, our steaks were terrible. After waiting almost 40 minutes for a steak they were served to us cold and cooked unevenly. It hasn't happened before, we've been here and number of times but we will not be coming back. The quality of the cut of meet was not impressive, I had a ribeye steak cooked medium, it wasovercooked and a little too tough. My date had a New York strip steak that was put in front of him cold."}
{"text":"Sonny is an awesome server! Took such good care of us and knows so much about the menu! Our food took just a little longer than normal and he gave us a discount without us ever complaining or saying anything. Come in and see him!"}
{"text":"a wonderful place to get a steak cooked perfectly, and the seasoning is spot-on every time.  No need for condiments!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time ever at longhorn. I had the Steak with Spaghetti squash... I really cannot complain. It was not the best meal ever but it was solid. The spaghetti squash had an outstanding flavor but was a bit under cooked. The steak was excellent, well cooked and flavorful. It was a nice place for my kids as well. That is one of the most important things to me. They had a good menu that was easy to choose and it has good background noise so my kids don't stand out. 
Our waitress was really friends and very helpful. He refilled drinks without asking and cleaned up kids spill in a jiffy. 
We would go back if we were looking for steak. It doesn't compare to the amazing mom and pop places in my area but it's a solid choice. 
I only took a few photos because we ate too fast!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix and the Tempe area, I ended up staying in Chandler to save some money on hotel charges.  Thank goodness I did, the options for food and drinks and Shopping are hands down a million times better.  If you're looking for a college bar, downtown Tempe is perfect, but if you're a little more tenured and mature and just want quality and a good place to eat or relax, Chandler is the place for you.  This Longhorn is clean and the staff was polite and attentive but not over bearing. Anthony was my server and made great recommendations on the Amber beer and was spot on my entire visit.  I always order a filet, rare with asparagus, it was cooked perfectly rare but had too much seasoning which was easily wiped off with my knife.  A good steak needs nothing but some salt and pepper.  The thing that really set this restaurant off for me was the local craft Amber beer.  I requested a Santan epicenter Amber draft on Anthony's recommendation with my steak.  It is a perfectly smooth Amber that is very similar to my Columbus Ohio favorite, Diesel punk honey Amber.  I'm so happy I found it on a Tuesday, since I'm here a couple more nights.  If I don't come back here I will be finding a restaurant in Chandler that serves Santan Epicenter Amber draft, but I think I am already planning my return tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Great place for steaks at a reasonable price. Good sides bread and salads.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a tournament and wanted to treat ourselves with a steak after winning it.  We also wanted to try some place that we had not been before hence the trip to Longhorn.  The decor was pleasant as well as the employee who seated us and the server who was at the table quickly.  We scanned the menu but saw they had a special (we went on a Sunday) for two people that included an appetizer (or dessert), salads, and several entrees to pick from for $30.  I am not sure if this is a standard special or we were there at a particular promotion time.  The server immediately after taking our order brought a plank of honey wheat bread with butter that was very good.  We chose the spinach dip with chips and that was also excellent.  For the entree, my wife and I both chose the portobello sirloin (8 oz) with garlic sauce.  Normally it is a hit and miss on how well the steak is cooked to your satisfaction but in this case, it was absolutely perfect.  Mine was medium well with just a hint of pink while my wife's was medium rare (I try not to look at it while I am eating-LOL!) but it looked like the proverbial picture of a steak cooked to that order.  Very impressed.  My wife had the large glass of wine and I had ice tea as I was driving but was wondering what the hit was going to be for the house red but to my surprise, it was a very reasonable price ($8). In all a very pleasant experience and would certainly recommend and we will return.  As an after thought, the restaurant noise was at a minimum which is also a big plus factor as some of the steak houses (especially chain ones) can be extremely noisy."}
{"text":"Super friendly. Wonderful food. And the manager offered fries to our picky lil girl. Even though we couldn't accept the offer it meant a lot that he tried."}
{"text":"Awsome food matched with Awsome Service. Excellent Experience, Our Server Ruben was the best anywhere...  The wait was well we didn't have to wait, they took us to our table immediately, the manager was all over the place making sure things were in order but not bugging poeple, when I want steak, this is the place to go hands down... The booths were very comfortable, Ruben was so thankful our young ones were so well behaved he sent over a complimentary  ice cream desert fir them to share.   You don't see thus kind of quality service ANYWHERE, Great job guys."}
{"text":"Excellent service and perfect medium rare steak! Make sure you try the longhorn steak sauce. They make it at your table using garlic, jasmine, and orange peels."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of it. Flat iron done perfect.  No fat to worry about service was great"}
{"text":"Tasty enough food, not so great service. I don't usually write reviews for super chain-y places, but this may change since so many places don't seem to care about service anymore.
We have tried this location 3 times now. Each time, we were not greeted at the host stand until we said something to the staff. I am not the kind of person where I expect someone to drop what they are doing and start kissing my buns. I am the type of person who fees that a quick hello, be right with you/ welcome be right with you is common courtesy. 
Our server was polite, if a bit aloof. I just figured it was on the back end of the night, so dinner is winding down. No prob, we just wanted a couple steaks for dinner. Food was prompt to come out, but only warm. Not piping hot. Again, nothing was cold, order was correct nothing to even mention to the server. In fact, she noticed my partner's steak was over cooked and asked if he'd like a new one. No thanks, we're hungry and it was all juicy and tender, so we'll just eat our food.
My concern: We were seated in the bar and I noticed that our booth was dirty. Not the table,  but the s&p shakers had seen cleaner days and the table light, the wall molding, the both dividers themselves were gnarly. Covered in GOBS OF DUST AND GRIME. It looked as if the entire area where the table meets the wall and the wall \"decor\" itself was never cleaned in its history. 
I could actually see the grime/dust in the air in the light cast from the overhead lights and booth light. It honestly killed my appetite that I only ate a few bites of steak. I was way hungry from my long day but I couldn't eat my steak and that's saying something. 
I asked for the manager to explain. Wow. What an awkward dude. He walks up to our booth and just stands there looking at us. No hello, or intro. Literally silence. So I start, say hello, you must be the manager, I have a suggestion.   He keeps staring as I explain the situation. Explained that I couldn't even eat my steak. Just a blank face. No apology. No emotion. He said Oh wow and that he'd \"take me comment to heart.\" Da fuq? 
So I stared back at him. \"I can make sure they clean,\" he adds. Hmm. Okay, so I gather no fuqs given. He turned awkwardly back to the kitchen and was gone. 
I think the people that work there don't seem to care very much, just my experience from each time we've gone. 
We'll be sure to go someplace else next time I need a steak."}
{"text":"Have an urban legend: My wife says she knew a guy who knew a guy who went to Longhorn's every day.  He worked across the street from them, and every day he sauntered over to get a steak.  

Six months later, all his teeth fell out.  Why?  All the meat tenderizer they used to soften up the steaks softened his gums, and the only steaks he could enjoy from then on were pureed.  

Now, I'm sure that's not true - and yes, I have had severe dental troubles, but that's not due to Longhorn's steaks.  Longhorn's the only real steak place within walking distance from the house, so when I'm in the mood to kill a cow, this is where I go.  

And their steaks ARE tender.  

It's not bad.  The meat is of a decent quality, and they get +1 star for having hot, fresh-baked bread brought to your table (I usually gobble through at least a basket and a half, I am such a bread whore).  Pretty much the whole menu consists of \"Cow with stuff,\" whether that stuff be cheese, onions, mushrooms, or perhaps more cow.  If you don't like cow, don't come here.  But if you have a hankerin' for a quick, mid-priced steak, you could do a lot worse.  

As it is, for a chain, it's pretty good.  The only problem I have is that they USED to have peanut shells sprinkled all over the floor to give it that down-South flavor, and now they stopped because of those wusses with peanut allergies.  I mean, what's the fun of a restaurant that can't kill people randomly?  Five Guys is willing to slaughter innocents with THEIR deadly peanut dander, and that's why they have more stars in my book."}
{"text":"We went to Longhorn to celebrate my son's birthday.  It was ok, nothing special.  The waitress was very nice. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"When we think of steak we go to Longhorn for a great steak at a great price. We always have great service. Last night was a bit different not in the food and certainly not in the service. And believe me I understand that we live in the land of freedom of speech but with all that has taken place in our city in the past couple of weeks we should really focus on doing the right thing and treating ALL people with respect. We witness our waitress who was a black woman being totally disrespected by a white man that was seated in her service area. To the point she was in tears. She told her manager what was had taken place and in turn she refused to continue waiting on him so they sent another young lady (white) to service his table. I'm sorry but there is no way I would ever have my employees not feeling safe at there work place where most of us spend more time than our homes. I'm sure $30-$90 bucks and trust $90 is pushing it. Is not worth the safety of your employees. This man should have been asked to leave. There has to be a starting point and if we had and ounce empathy of how she felt or still feel that someone can come in and belittle her with racial demeaning words than I'm guessing Longhorn supports exactly what we said \"Her life didn't matter because She's Black\"
I would like to apologize to her I'm sorry she has to work for a company that hires managers that can't comprehend better judgement when it comes to the safety of their staff of ALL nationalities. 
I finished my steak at home"}
{"text":"Over cooked and over seasoned steak. Waitstaff seemed preoccupied and refilling our wine and tea seemed like an inconvenience. This is the second time we've had this experience here. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, one of best places to get a steak in medina. I would highly recommend this Longhorn location to anyone."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's high school graduation here May 22.  We had a party of ten and went before the ceremony.  It was not crowded and did not take long to be seated however they placed us in the middle of the floor and placed two round tables together which was odd and uncomfortable.  We ordered several appetizers, the spinach dip was good but the lobster dip was way too salty. Everyone who ordered steak dinners were pleased however my salmon dinner was over cooked and salty and the server never brought my side of broccoli.  When I asked for it, my sister who had already tried hers, assured me I did not want it.  The worst part was having both the server and the manager asked what the occasion was, congratulate my son but not offer a complimentary dessert! That's the least they could do for a $300 tab for mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. The food is amazing. It tasted like heaven in our mouths. The filets were so tender and flavorful. The sweet potatoes were perfect. 

Best of all was our server Jessica. She deserves a raise. She was the sweetest, most helpful, knowledgeable server we could ever ask for."}
{"text":"Went with a Filet, was thinking about Ribeye, but they only had 11 once cuts for that, I was VERY pleased with the steakm didnt even need to put any steak sauce on it it was so good and tender! 
I went with a Jim Beam Blackberry drink- that wasnt that great and our server was awesome and got me something different and didnt charge us for that drink, I got a Strawberry Margarita and that was very good!
Wife went with a a Salmon, she liked it but felt it had to much seasoning on it. I would most certainly come back here! Wish they had these in the Tacoma/Puyallup area!"}
{"text":"this is place has the best steak i have eaten in ohio. keep up the good work i am always satisfied eating there"}
{"text":"Sometimes the service is great- sometimes not so much. Sometimes the food is great- sometimes not so much. Usually they're both great but I've had select times where they're both a bit rough."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the meal I had last Sunday at the Waterfront Long Horn. Looking for a good steak or prime rib. I had a choice of a Outback, my usual favorite, or a Texas Road House. Me and my Dad picked the Long Horn. It was mediocre at best. He had the  16oz. Prime Rib, it was quite fatty and chewy. I had the 14 oz. Rib Eye. I ordered it medium and it came out medium well. Not liking to complain , even though was very chewy for a rib eye I ate half of it. When the waiter asked how was my steak I said \"ok\" and that it was over cooked. He sent the manager over and the manager berated me because I did not say somethings earlier. He did however give me half off my steak. The chowder was too salty, the Cesar Salad had too much dressing on it but the Parmesan Spinach and Mushroom appetizer was very good. Also thumbs up on the strawberry shortcake was a highlight. For a $75.00 meal for two I did not feel satisfied with the experience. I would probably not rush back to any Long Horn if other options were available."}
{"text":"Couldn't comment on how the food tastes. I was seated at 7:10 and I'm still waiting for my food at 8:30. It's not that busy, not sure what's taking so long but the server is avoiding eye contact so he probably feels awkward about it to."}
{"text":"I recently had a takeout meal at Longhorn Steakhouse I was expecting the worst.The whole meal was awsome right down to the service at the bar!!!! The best steak I've  ever had,done just the way I asked for it sooooo good. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for my daughters 13th birthday as she asked for a huge piece of steak. We normally go to Road House next door but it was crazy packed and after a long day of work/school I made an executive decision to give LongHorn a try. Of course, after reading some yelpers reviews. We ordered our fav. the ribeye with some sides. Kiddo ordered ribeye as well. Our waiter was either tired or annoyed by us asking questions to the point he rolled his eye when walking away after I asked him how the sides worked here at LongHorn. Now, I understand LongHorn is a big chain restaurant but some of us are first timers ya know. Anywho, maybe it was just my waiter who seemed bothered by my question asking along with my pooped face from work all day mixed with his emotions and tiredness just didn't mix that day. Most likely I won't go back and will stick to our usual go to for steak RoadHouse. It just seems they always make you feel welcome there and everyone seems cheery which bumps up your mood which ultimately allows you to enjoy your dinner with those you love."}
{"text":"This longhorn seems to be a little bit nicer and faster than the others that i have ate at.  I havent written a review for a Longhorn because I eat at so many, but I felt this one to be worth the extra time to write a good review."}
{"text":"While visiting family my sister and I just had to get out of the house.  So we dragged our four kids here to have a night out, away from annoying family and of course, steak.

Get here early if you plan on bringing small children.  We got a large round table in the center of the dinning room.  Service was fast and efficient considering that we had four small children with us.

They also made possibly the best chocolate milk Ive ever tasted.  I don't even like chocolate milk and this was fantastic.  Very important with children.

We also had the Crab Artichoke Dip.  It was soooo goooood!  Get it!

I had the 6oz Filet with steamed Broccoli.  The meat was like silk.  Cooked to medium rare perfection.

My sister got some type of grilled Chicken Avocado thing in a thick tortilla.  She thought it would have sliced Avocado but it came with guacamole like paste.  She was not impressed.  So sad for her.

All the kids got Macaroni and Cheese.  It was excellent.  Like homemade Macaroni & Cheese.

Make a reservation for the family and get down here for the steak, the excellent service and the Crab Dip."}
{"text":"Average steak, seems they really dont give much effort with customer service...they forgot to put in 1 of the orders so my 5 ur old son didnt get his meal until the rest of us were almost done eating.....not even a \"sorry\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the area. I have never had bad service or a bad meal. The steaks melt in your mouth and the Red Rock Shrimp are so flavorful. They give large portions, so you will never go home hungry. Great place!"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I Yelp while sitting at the restaurant, but this time I feel the need.  First two stars because the food was decent.  Not as good as other times I've been here, but acceptable.  But the service has been horrible.  It took forever to get my drink and everyone's salad came out but mine.  Then I had to tell the waitress my salad was missing.  This is what happens when the waitress who took the order doesn't verify what comes out.  And now for the worse part of it, we had a coupon in our email that seems to have gotten lost. We told the waitress that we couldn't find it and she sent over the manager.  He sat here trying to help look through our email to find it but it again wasn't there.  He said that there was nothing he could do because we couldn't find the email since every code is unique.  Now the waitress comes back over and says the complete opposite of what the manager said.  She said there is one code and I believe her since she has entered a bunch this week.  So the manager is apparently a liar and didn't even offer to take the $5 off the $110 bill.  Lying manager and crappy service is not something I will accept."}
{"text":"I hadn't dined at a Longhorn Steakhouse in years and was hoping they had improved from my last visit and experience, but I'm afraid they haven't. This place is so over priced for the type and quality of food they serve, that it isn't funny. 
I have never had such dry baby back ribs in my life, AND NO taste at all to them. terrible, simply terrible. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the staff is so outstanding, unfortunately, that doesn't make the food any better.
If the food they serve here (at least the ribs) aren't microwaved, then I don't know a thing about food.
My advice is to avoid this place at all costs because you're not only going to spend way, way too much money, but you're also going to be very, very disappointed in the food you receive. I honestly don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Last nite excellent meal and service Small order of parmesan crusted chicken and still took some he. Very good!"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated and the waitress took our drink orders quickly.  I had ordered a hamburger with fries.  The hamburger was good and cooked to my specifications.  Fairly expensive for the portion sizes but the food quality adds to the value and experience."}
{"text":"It's not bad...it's fine.

The steaks are pretty decent, they're seasoned well, just not mind-blowing. If I may qoute my favorite movie \"history of the world\", I'll say what caesar said: \"Nice, not thrilling, but nice.\"

The vegetable sides are over cooked and flat, usual american fare...carrots, broccoli, meh. The salads were the usual romaine, nothing interesting. Of course it's a steakhouse, the salads and sides aren't the best, it's the steak you care about.

Decent cuts, cooked right, nice servers too. Not a bad place to go for a little variety maybe once a year or so, I'm not HUGE into meat and steak, I went as part of a gift, so hey, it wasn't a loss. If you're a meat fanatic go try it out."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Service is always good, food comes out right, AND cooked right.  Which BTW seems to be getting harder to find someone that knows how to cook a steak to temp.  At least these guys still remember how to do it.  Usually a small wait, which is OK, bar has good service as well."}
{"text":"I order the filet and what can I say, it's Longhorns . It was tender, juicy and tasty. They killed it. The mixed veggies on point. Last but not least the loaded bake potatoes was a little over baked but you wouldn't know by the way I ate through this plate. So good I forgot about the price."}
{"text":"Well as you see it's got 5 stars. Wow it was that good. Now this is not something I give lightly but yes it was that good and grate services. Tell you the truth the only thing I could complained about was no appetizers were gluten free. I did ask for gluten free and the server awesome made Shure to put gluten allergy on it just in case. Smart woman and she also caught that the appetizers we're not gluten feee fast. That is what you look for in a server one that looks out for you. Don't get me wrong there are other server out there that are good but most thinking lack somewhere I could not with here she took real good care of us made sure we had our glasses full did not desert us when she order was around if question need to be asked. There just are not that many that go that extra mile any more ours did. Now let's get to the food well I 1/2 expected it to be good not grate. Boy was i off the food was just the way I like it as I ordered it. They have grate cooks and grate food the veggies were just a slight hard just the way they should be. Well if that was not good enough they tweeted me to make sure my food and service was good. This placed would of got 6 if they had it. Yes it was that good to bad it had to be in AZ for me to find that place."}
{"text":"Good service and nice mix of seafood and steaks. My family loved it. Will recommend it to other visitors to Madison."}
{"text":"The food was expected, but I suspect they were quite understaffed when we came in sunday."}
{"text":"I came to LongHorn for a Yelp Elite event and had an amazing time.  I have been to LongHorn before and I always thought that they were just like any other chain, but after learning about their fresh cut meats and experiencing top, top service, I am a newly converted fan!

The ribeye is completely flavorful and delicious (and huge) by the way.  Surprisingly, my favorite part of the meal was dessert!  Chocolate cake was A+!  I had not thought about going  to LongHorn before for a great meal, but now I can't wait to bring my husband there!

Great job!"}
{"text":"Ordered the prime rib rare. It showed up medium well. It was dry and cold. Caesars salad was room temp and soggy."}
{"text":"For a chain Restaurant this place has its stuff together.  
    We were seated promptly and had our drinks at our table within 2 minutes of being seated.  
    We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. It was at our table even before we had finished reviewing the menu and making our dinner selections.  
    Lizabeth, our server was on top of her game. Barely had we finished our appetizer and our meal was being delivered to our table.  Our drinks were never empty and she anticipated our every request.
    I had the Large Ribeye steak which I ordered medium rare. It was perfect. Slightly warm and still red in the center.  I had asked for steak sauce because most places I've eaten at their steaks need the extra flavor but not tonight.  I cut my entire steak using a butter knife it was so tender and it was perfectly seasoned.  To add anything to it would have been criminal.
    My lovely bride had the petite sirloin and 1/2 rack of ribs.  She declared them the best she can remember ever having.
    The atmosphere was perfect for a date night.  Subdued lighting and a intimate table for two 
    Great job"}
{"text":"Had a date night with the hubby. We decided to try somewhere new and we picked Longhorn. We waited to be seated for about 7 mins. Not too bad considering with was dinner time on a Sunday. 

We ordered drinks, their 2 for special and in addition an appetizer that wasn't listed on the special. From the white peach sangria, stuffed mushrooms, to the longhorn salmon and to top it off - the chocolate stampede - it was a very filling yet satisfying meal. 

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here, great service but I wasn't very impressed with the food... they forgot our sauteed mushroom and onion on both of our steaks so we had to wait and by the time they gave it to us the steak wasn't that warm anymore. The steak was just the way I ordered it nice and tender but it had no flavor. The waitress was very very nice but next time I will wait 15-30 minutes for the Texas Roadhouse so so worth the wait"}
{"text":"What a disappointment after I talked my wife into giving them another try. When we arrived there was hardly anyone in the restaurant so they tried to seat us by the restroom. I was having none of that so we got different seats. Then we ordered my wife got a steak and I got prime rib both ordered medium rare with asparagus which cost extra. My wife's steak was cooked fine my prime rib was almost well done yuck. Sent it back it came with the smallest baked potato I've ever seen. The asparagus was terrible and not trimmed properly. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Its ok but a little overpriced.  Again this is a chain restaurant and it is about what you expect.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday two weeks ago at about 8:30pm, it was my birthday so there was 11 of us. We were so happy to get there and it was not full. 

There were approximately three couples a head of ourbig party. We tried to reserve a table earlier but were told they didn't take reservations.

 As we arrived, my sister checked in with the hostess. I watched one female roll her eyes at my sister when she turned to walk away and her coworker laugh about it. 

The manager about 5 minutes later approaches my brother in law and says it would be and 1 hour and 45 minute wait because there were 15 people a head of us.  We asked him where were they? He didn't know what to say and said that it was their wait time. A lot of people tend to exaggerate when they give a review but I stand by this. This place was not even busy! There were numerous available tables. We got the impression they just wanted an easy closing and didn't want to serve us. 

I would have gone to Texas Road House but it was my birthday and I wasnt dressed to sit on a saddle. So thanks to the manager and the ghetto hostesses at Long Horn,  Red Lobster ended up getting our business and gave me a free margarita!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times & have never been disappointed. UNTIL March 20, 2018. First, the hostess seated us at a wet table.  She did grab a napkin to dry it off but then, promptly left without waiting for us to sit down, hand us our menus or even tell us anything. Andrew was our waiter. He never offered us the complimentary bread & we had to ask for it. I had requested lemon in my water & had to ask twice more for the lemon. I chose a garden salad, while my husband chose a Caesar Salad: my salad was served but, we had to ask for my husband's. 
I ordered my filet medium rare & it was well done. Cedric, the manager that night, did bring me a second steak AND took the cost off of our tab. However, the second filet was RARE, thus undercooked.  We have never had such a poor experience here & tend to think of Longhorn as better quality than some other restaurants.  Greatly disappointed.  Although Cedric tried to make it right,  the whole dinner was terrible.  I know that employee's will perform up to, or beneath, what management expects & requires. From the hostess to the server to the chef.... perhaps Cedric isn't requiring quality? ? Oh, BTW, when I mentioned that had asked for lemon in my water,  the server blamed the bartender. 
Very sad, disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars because of the service. It's started off with our waitress only having two other tables than ours and took about 15 minutes to even greet us. She wasn't busy. We then ordered two waters and two perfect margaritas and were really excited about them since we've had them before. As we were waiting for our drinks our waitress brought out our bread, but with no plates for us. Then our margaritas arrived about 20 min after that with waters but no straws for the drinks. Everything was ok until I noticed something floating in my drink. I fished it out and finished the marg thinking everything would be alright. They give you a shaker with extra margarita so I poured the rest into my glass and noticed more stuff floating in my drink....

I decided to open the shaker and whaddya know there's black mold all inside of the shaker. I decided to investigate my boyfriends margarita glass and noticed a lipstick stain on the rim of his glass. Now with both of us being in the restaurant industry we know how to handle things like this and politely asked our server if we could get new ones. She rolled her eyes and said sorry. She brought us new ones 10 min later. 

Our food arrives and the steaks were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Nothing wrong with the food. However my boyfriend decided to inspect the new shakers. They definitely gave us the same shaker as the one before with the black mold all inside of the rim and stuff was floating around in the new drinks. \"Sigh\". By the time we noticed this we were already finished with our dinner. 

They only charged us for two drinks, but needless to say I won't be ordering another drink that requires a shaker from this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place food and service is great. This location has enough parking so there is no need to drive around. The decor is south western casual dinning.

The macaroni and cheese is heavenly. Bring your appetite because the stakes are grill to perfection.  My son and I shared the 30oz porter house for 2 with salad and 2 sides; Mac and cheese and fire grilled corn. I usually have the mauhi or salmon but this time I was feeling carnavorish. 

On other occasion I've had their mash potatoes which I enjoyed. They also have seasonal plates like the green fried tomatoes. Try it it's good."}
{"text":"I was presently surprised when I went here for a lunch date. It did remind me of the many chain bars with the dark interior and wood everything. However, the way it is laid out was enough to be special. I arrived just after the lunch rush and the place was empty. So our waitress was not running between tables. She was very attentive and smiled plenty. I had the feeling she was ready to catch some rest. I ordered the grilled chicken fruit salad. This plate was delicious!! The meat was seasoned just right and the added fruit set it off!! If you stop by have the chicken salad you'll be glad."}
{"text":"Great food again but........ dirty dishes and glasses.  Management needs to step up and do something about nasty/dirty dishes and all."}
{"text":"My food came out COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ruins the whole meal. Waitress was very good! They seemed VERY short staffed. I more than likely won't go here again. If it wasn't for waitress being nice, I would've gave a 2. PS: not sure who is cooking the food, but it wasn't that good! I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner at the Longhorn. The place SCREAMS Darden Restaurants. OMG it is so plastic and cookie cutter LOL. . OK this is an honest review. We had 5 people in our party and were quoted 50 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later we were seated in a 3/4 full dining room...OK.. We ordered 2 appetizers and at this point I settled in for a Darden restaurant experience. What I mean by a Darden experience is insincere fake , pay and leave, crappy food and people around us thinking hey this is good. Oh and do not forget the lowest quality food out there dressed with something that makes it even worse. I got far less then that. The 2 appetizers were god awful. Ok entrees arrived. \"here you go folks shhhhhhhh do not tell anyone we mask a bad cut of meat with SALT and then MORE SALT\". OK it is darden i get it...but LOL  REALLY ?  All 5 of us were looking at each other and silently asking \" is it just me or is this  REALLY bad? I simply can not say enough to how bad the food was. 
Service was EXTREMELY unprofessional and painfully slow. The server knew absolutely nothing menu related. Now get this 1 of our people asked for the steak black & Blue. the MANAGER came over and said \"i have been in the steak business a long time and i have never heard of that\". UMMMM OK. LOL  WOW !!! Both Filet Mignons were chewy for filet, NY Strip was really odd texture, Porterhouse was REDICULOUSLY fatty.
Just do not bother going it is a total waist of time and effort."}
{"text":"The food is on the brink of so-so. The service average. 

I'm pretty picky about steak so I calculated my odds of being happy (with what could go wrong) and ordered the Rib-eye medium-rare.  With the same thought in mind, I opted for a salad and baked potato.  Pretty simple right?  That was my plan.

What I got was a very tough steak that was actually cooked to perfection.  I ordered medium-rare and that's exactly what I got - a perfectly cooked steak of the poorest quality!   My baked potato had clearly been baked too long, \"dry\" even when dripping with butter and sour cream.  The salad was fine and unremarkable.  

Long and short - I won't go back.  When you can't chew a medium-rare Rib-eye, there's definitely a problem.  But the person on the grill \"rocks!\""}
{"text":"The one star is mainly for service, although the room temperature slimy beer cheese I was served that made me ill wasn't pleasant. I eat here quite frequently and normally love their food (order to-go steaks from here even!) After the last time I visited, I got pretty sick and when I called the following morning to ask about the weird cold cheese I was served I was told by Tony that it wasn't possible that their food had made me sick. Told him how sick I had been overnight and he tried telling me how food born illness works. He grilled me about what my order had been because I didn't have my receipt, so I recalled my order detail by detail so he could find my order. He called me an hour or two later and began the conversation with \"Hello its Tony, How are you?\" to which I replied \"fine\" Tony began to explain that he was sure it was not his restaurants food that made me sick, and when I asked why I was served cold cheese that was supposed to be hot, he replied with \"It is always kept at 165 degrees.\"  I mentioned how ill I still was from whatever I ate when Tony snapped back \"I though you said you felt better? You said you were fine when I asked you how you were.\" He then began to argue with me about the situation and said I could call his insurance to file a claim. I then told him I wanted to speak with his manager because he was patronizing me and making me feel like I was wrong for even calling to ask about their food preparation. He kept asking if I had a coupon, asking what I wanted from it had ZERO customer service skills. I only wanted to see what was going on with food there because I enjoy eating there and don't want anyone getting sick like I did. 

After the phone call with Tony, I received a phone call from another manager named Tina. She was helpful and kind. Showed real concern for how I felt and reassured me that she would look into heating and prep of cheese. Found out it's microwaved per order, still don't know what happened there! I received a 25$ gift cert. that I might use, or I might give away. 
DON'T GET THE BEER CHEESE! try the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night, we had been here previously and was not over or underwhelmed by the place.  Tonight was very different.  We were seated promptly our waitress came right up and got our drink orders, while she was gone a different waiter came over to make sure we had been helped.   We both ordered the Sirloin steak, I like mine well done and my husband likes his very rare (we are nothing alike but it works) The Salads were very nice salads very fresh looking.  The bread was very good (I just wish they would cut the bread all the way through when you pull the last little bit off you either get a slice and a half or half a slice).
The steaks were the best I have had in a very long time,  I don't know what flavoring they use but it is very good.  I mentioned that my husband and I like our steaks cooked totally opposite and still we both loved the steaks.  Our server was very personable and efficient.  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a nice tender steak it's been a long times since I had one like this. I would definitely recommend this Great restaurant. I wish I could go there once a week"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night, encountered a few problems with our food.  They brought the food out with the salads, crowding the table.  My ribs were not warm, asked if they could be reheated and was brought a new plate.  The new ribs were very dry and had almost no meat, I showed the waitress and she brought me chicken at my request.  My husbands steak was OK but overdone.  The waitress was never rude, but it was obvious she was frazzled and put off by the issues we were having.  The manager came over, apologized and refunded the price of our food which I felt was above and beyond.  So I am leaving a good review because even though the food was \"off\" this visit, the service was good and I felt they tried to make things right.  We will visit again!"}
{"text":"They had us waiting for more than 30 minutes to get a table. Ones we had a table our main dishes taked 45 mins. Finally my dinner arrived!! My meat was well done when I asked for medium done. The best I got was a \"We are sorry\". DONT COME HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place was terrible! I like seasoning, but they seriously drown their steak and chicken in a boat load of salt. The place was empty on a Friday night (except for a few older folks), but our server was super slow and took forever to just refill our drinks and bring ketchup to our table. I know it sounds petty, but the whole experience sucked. This place has gone downhill, and I would recommend that you skip across the street to another steakhouse chain for edible food. The highlight of the evening was the bread."}
{"text":"We enjoy Longhorn very much, and it has become our \"go to\" for steak in Champaign. The food is delicious. The manager, Mitch Johnson, is very friendly and genuinely wants his guests to have a pleasant experience. He makes a point to check on you during your meal and usually follows up afterwards. If any Longhorn execs are reading this, Mitch is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Went there at 930 on a Saturday. They welcomed us and were very friendly and kind. I got the strip steak it was cooked to my liking and tasted very good. First time I was here was a good experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we were here as it has always been hit or miss.  Tonight was definitely a hit.  We tried the 2 new sauces on the Outlaw Ribeye and the NY strip.  The sauces were excellent and the steaks cooked perfectly.  Our server, though quite young, was on it.  Beverages refilled before asking, and at just the right time.  Present when needed, scarce when not.  Best we've had in a while."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good food and they know how to Make a good lemon drop Martini will be back again"}
{"text":"First time I ate at Longhorn in a long time my waitress was named Christina she seem like she was always in a hurry I ordered a slabber ribs and a sweet potato side with my ribs came out she set my plate down in five minutes later she handed me my truck by Jan I was aggravated because I felt that I was being rushed to finish my meal so I put all my food dishes all in one plate said here take it if you're in such a hurry and she looked at me with surprise inside and I'm not in a hurry I go yes UR I had my food for 10 minutes and You already brought me my check. and then she just looked at me OK have a nice day I complain to the manager and I knew he wouldn't do anything the only thing he said was I'm so sorry if you felt rushed I I haven't eaten there in probably a year and now I know why I won't be back it was a Friday night they only want to get people in and out fast very disappointed I feel that I spent $26 for nothing I might as well through that money right out the window that's how I feel very disappointed with this restaurant"}
{"text":"The server was great.  She was really attentive.  We ordered the porterhouse and salmon which were pretty good.  So, my only complaint is that the wall lamps and sills were extremely dusty.  Seriously,  it only takes 5 minutes at the most to wipe down the areas at night.  I feel that's poor management and this is the reason behind the 3 stars.  One of the biggest things I enjoy is cleanliness in a restaurant. I think LongHorn fails in the cleaniless area when it comes to simple dusting."}
{"text":"We were in Wisconsin and decided to give this place a try since I always see the commercials in San Diego. It was packed for a Friday night and we had to wait a little over 45 minutes to be seated. The service was basic and our meals arrived in a reasonable amount of time.

The presentation of the meal left much to be desired and the steak was about average. It was not the worst steak I have ever eaten however I would not see myself returning to this particular restaurant.

The plating was rather boring with meat, potato and a side. No additional garnishing to appeal to the senses just nothing of interest. It's hard to believe folks are waiting over an hour to eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"My second time here 1 week. The place wasnt exactly crowded.for a Saturday. Nonetheless we waited over an hour for our food (5 adults).

The server was minimalist in her attention to us as we were often wondering where she was. By the time our food arrived we were ready to eat. The entrees were a bit salty but tasty and were closer to warn than hot. The appetizers (fried green tomatoes and shrimp stack) came faster and were appropriate in temperature.

The entrees left a lot to be desired. Truth is, in Fairlawn you can get as good to better steak and seafood. No need to come here. Again, nice people, immature workflow.

Our server asked if everything was good about 5 minutes after presenting the entrees. Bad timing if you [the restaurant] want the truth. We were already so done with the wait, unless the food was fecal we just wanted to eat and leave. We offered no feedback. Our bad.

We did wave the manager over before we left and shared what is written here. She apologized and blamed the wait on the surge of university students that they didn't anticipate. Bad response. We are your most important clients and are not interested in why our food was delayed and warm. She granted the Mac and cheese for free and my wife had a $4 off coupon.

I will return, but only if the rest of copley, bath, and Fairlawn have lengthy lines when we want streak or seafood. At least then we know the entire region is in for a long wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and excellent service. I took my mom out to a belated birthday dinner here. I got the LongHorn Salmon with a baked potato and French fries. The salmon was perfectly grilled and seasoned and the fries were crisp on the outside while being fluffy on the inside. The endless honey wheat bread was warm with whipped butter. My mom got the Outlaw Ribeye with a baked potato and salad. She said her steak was tender and medium as she ordered it. For dessert, I tried the carrot cake mini bundt cake and she got the seasonal strawberry cake. The carrot cake was warm and moist cake filled with raisins, nuts and flavorful spices with cream cheese icing. Her strawberry cake was also moist with fresh berries and layers of strawberry and icing. Overall, the meal was really good and I will definitely be returning. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and the service was efficient and correct."}
{"text":"My bf and I were a little skeptical based on the 3 starts but decided to try it out anyways. The decor is awesome and definitely western. It is very clean including the bathrooms. When we first sat down we received our drinks fast but after that the service definitely slacked. My boyfriend finally said something to one of the managers and after that it was smooth sailing. Jennifer who is the kitchen manager took over for whoever was supposed to be out server. She was outstanding and even gave us a complimentary starter because of our issue. The Texas tanion (sp?) was outstanding. My boyfriend ordered the outlaw rib eye which he said was the best tasting steak he has had in ten years. I ordered the primetime burger which was one of the best burgers I have ever had, it was so juicy. We will definitely be back again. Started off shaky but ended amazing."}
{"text":"This would have been a 1 star but the manager made it right. Started out being seated right away..early eve on a Friday. But then it took my husband walking back to the hostess stand 15 minutes later to get someone to wait on us. Okay strike 1. We ordered then (since we had so much time to read the menu). More than 10 minutes later server informs hubby that prime rib he ordered was not ready. Gave him a menu to order something else and congratulated him on ordering a shrimp dish because it wouldn't take too long to cook. Lol. Mgr then brought us an appetizer to make up for the initial delay. Food came and it was quite good   Server brought the check and informed us hubby's meal free for not having what he ordered. So all is well that ends well. We will be back simply because the righted the wrong!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal ! What great value and flavor perfect steak and sides. Truly enjoyed dinner with my Mom the food quality. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tried there new chicken breast sandwich with fries, just OK nothing memorable, be sure to cut your sandwich in half, the first one came out the chicken was half cook, salmonella city, they took it back and fixed it, services and wait staff was good. When you've had food from other states and countries it's hard to be impressed,"}
{"text":"Service was amateur your . Sat next to a nasty  dirty table all night, no bussers in sight, no manager in sight, very dirty atmosphere,  food was good, but Sat with appetizers for 20 minutes before we could get plates from a passing server,  just hard to believe a restaurant  is run.like this, on a Saturday night no less,  andl it wasn't busy, steak was ok but sides were cold,.  Don't waste your money, plenty of decent, clean steakhouse in the valley."}
{"text":"High 5's to caring staff; hubby ordered chard steak & waiter Ray brings over his area Mgr Jeff to make sure they understand just how my hubby wants his steak cooked; now that's service. Pleasant conversation with Jeff we tell him we're celebrating our 36th wedding anniversary; another High 5 cuz he says we look too young to be married 36yrs. Thank you Mgr Sarah, Jeff & Ray for a relaxing dinner and awesome service."}
{"text":"I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \"Why don't you just go to Outback??\"  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...

*Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  

*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.

*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.

*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.

*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  

*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  

There's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?"}
{"text":"Great food. Service was bad the first two times there but the third time was fantastic. The server's on the third trip were great fast and verry attentive.  Hope they keep it up. If so I will give a better review."}
{"text":"Jennifer K is the most awesome waitress at the new Longhorn Steakhouse on Covenant Avenue.   Our meals and drinks were superb. Will be back and will be requesting Jen!!!"}
{"text":"Our Filets were prepared exactly as we specified. The food was incredible, the service was great, the manager stopped by and congratulated us on our anniversary and gave us desert on the house. We could not have been more pleased or stuffed"}
{"text":"We've been to the one in Robinson for a Cousins Luncheon and for Mothers Day recently.

Both times the food was really good.  For a change I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was really good also they have some sort of Pretzel Bites that are Really Good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since the Lone Star closed down and it's been good. The servers are always sweet and attentive. The food is what you would expect at a place like this,  which isn't a bad thing!  I've had something different every time I came and it's all been tasty."}
{"text":"The first time we went here my food was under cooked. Decided to give it a try the second time and we got our salads with no silverware. The steak was dry and the Parmesan spinach was too salty. Not all that great"}
{"text":"Back again because we got a gift card due to them messing up 3 steak previous trip and had the something happen this time and the manager anna was very rude and miserable from the time we walked in.

Going down hill"}
{"text":"Very great experience for moms 50th birthday. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Food was great!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday, food was ok, service was lacking, server forgot our soup and fries, had to ask for them, never refilled my tea. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Longhorn is a great steakhouse. The service is good and the bar is nice as well. I've never had a bad meal here. We keep coming back partly because of that."}
{"text":"One of the family's favorite steakhouses in town!!! Great service and awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was GREAT took care of all of us... the prime rib wasn't shaved more chunky but tasty... had to take the salad home forgot the nuts and dressing but overall it was a 4 star..."}
{"text":"I have one word.... cucumber mojito! Amazing!

Stayed in a hotel in the area just for fun. So we grabbed a few drinks here before starting the night. 

The bartender was incredible. Very personable and funny. The type where you want to come back knowing that she knew her drinks. And she was personable.

We didn't eat here, but i've eated at other locations. The food is really good. 

But this review is about the cucumber mojito! I could have drank a million of those!!! I want one now!"}
{"text":"I have seen their advertisements for cheap lunches for over a year and just never made it in. Maybe it looked too fancy from the outside or I just didn't expect to be able to get in and out in a quick amount of time. To my surprise, the place wasn't all too busy during the 'lunch rush' time. Most of the customers were senior citizens? What's wrong with this picture!? Must be Madison's best kept secret for lunch.

I've eaten here twice in one week... my first trip was great, Caesar salad with shrimp and lobster chowder was tasty and filling! All that was but a mere $7! My second trip I went to try something different... the $8 options this time. A little more hearty this time... I ordered the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich with french onion soup. Two rocking meals in one week? Can't wait to go for the $9 option next time.

Staff is really friends and checks on you enough to refill bread and drinks. This may just become my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews but I had to write this. Appetizer took more than 30 min come and when it came it was soggy and messy. Shrimp was oily soggy and tasteless. Salad felt like it was cut a week ago and it looks \"OLD\". That was my first visit in this restaurant and I absolutely hate it here
Manager came apologized for mistakes. End up ordering $25 Steak which was really good though the side order risotto was NOT good."}
{"text":"So I don't know about these comments but I had the best experience ever I walked in there I'm not being from the area I'm reading your reviews walked in for a cocktail saw the menu and was shocked we ordered some dirty martinis with blue cheese olives and Parmesan crusted steak and a fillet wow amazing not overcomes everything was done to perfection very tasty very very highly suggested"}
{"text":"My steak was wrong, but I didn't say anything.  My potato was just right. I was getting ready to cut my steak when she grabbed my plate mid stream of cutting & said where's your parmesan crust? Me: I don't know, I was shocked She grabbed my plate.  She took my plate, which I didn't request, and brought it back when the other six in  our party were almost done.  My steak had melted cheese all over it, not a parmesan crust. My potato had been changed too!  The steak & potato weren't even warm. The steak was well done,  not medium well, and every bite was fat!! The changed potato was soaked in sour cream,  which I had requested not to have on it.
I didn't finish my steak or the potato.
  As we are leaving, I  was looking around, and what caught my eye;  a man put a bite of steak in his mouth & immediately spit it out into his hand..  hmm.. maybe he had what I had..   plus they weren't very busy,  so weekday the heck.  If I was paying for it instead of my Son,  I would have complained.  But, I didn't want to make a scene in front of him and the other six in our party, but they all noticed what had happened.  Two orders out of six at our table were correct.. I  think mine was awful. Not a good dinner!   I definitely will not go there again!!
This is a nice review compared to what I really wanted to say.."}
{"text":"Not particularly impressed with anything. It was my second time there. Wife needs to sit on the high top tables Due to a leg injury. The problem with that is that the bartender services those tables. He really Isn't interested.. He rather tend bar. The T-bone I ordered was thin and grizzly and under cooked. Wife's shrimp dish was OK. I really am aggravated with servers who come to the table and say \"how are we doing.? Or are we ready to order? I didn't know they were joining us.!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. This was supposed to be my fun birthday dinner. We had fun despite the missing dinner, the ruined steak, and the total lack of service. 

I must mention the awful, horrible, silly, steak dinner at the Longhorn restaurant on Sunday for my birthday dinner. It showed such promise and delivered so little.  We arrived, were put on a list and and waited about 10 minutes. Our seating was ok, but the booth seat padding was old so I picked the taller side. That was ok. It happens. We ordered. Our salad came and was ok although the balsamic vinaigrette dressing tasted like Italian to me. By the time the salads were eaten the bread arrived. Then our dinners took a while to arrive. Amelia's Parmesan chicken was reported as good, my strip steak was cooked to death and my potato excellent. Mom's steak did not look like a strip steak at all. Now the manager was convinced it was a strip steak, really. However, we were not convinced, and Mom's was returned to the kitchen.

Mom's plate was finally returned a half hour later. It had decent looking strip steak on it and one very overcooked sweet potato. We had meanwhile decided to get out of Dodge as the other two meals had been consumed. 

We asked for a box and a bill. Again it took a while. They did cut our bill down to $19.98. Personally, as a manager I would have wiped the slate clean and offered a gift card! What seemed like hours later we finally left the restaurant never to return and headed across the street for a great burger and shake at the In and Out Burger joint. We had a great time. And we decided from now on for my birthday dinner we will just have a burger! Its safer and faster.  Side note, Amelia and I ate mom's steak tonight for dinner with mashed potato's and peas. That steak was nicely done."}
{"text":"Went about 830 last night just past peak dinner time waited too long for the food and the family filled up on bread. Steaks were tough, over seasoned. Too salty. sides were sad. Couldn't eat the broccoli, the spoonful of instant mashed potatoes were ok. The mac and cheese had a funk to it, but it was probably tasty when it got made on Tuesday. Out $90 and the family is mad at me. Thanks guys!

Oh and they forgot to bring out the $4 bowl of canned mushrooms so the scorched up a batch in the microwave and got them right out to us.

wife had heartburn all night and that's my fault too."}
{"text":"OK. Folks tonight 3 of us walked in had the best service EVER... Emily G. Was on top of everything. Never had to ask once for something. And it wasn't even just our table her performance maintained across the restaurant.  She was professional and charming made us feel like we were apart of her family..  The food was on point as well. Hats off to the grill master working tomight.. all of our steaks were absolutely mouthwatering.. This was by far one of the best experiences.. thanks"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house, which is always good...

When I arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening, I was treated as if the restaurant was about to close.  The hostess was very short with me and my date.  She walked us to a table, dropped the menus, and walked away.

The server (never told us his name) came by the table and got our drink order.  No personality and didn't make us feel welcome.  We ordered eventually.  No personality, still.  (Are they closing soon?)

Dinner arrived and my steak didn't taste right.  My date didn't like her steak either.  The manager came by and offered next to nothing to make things right.  I eventually requested some A1 and dowsed my steak in that.

The best part of dinner was the sweet tea."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is extremely slow. Took forever and it wasn't crowded. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Everything started out good, we were seated immediately and our waitress stopped right over. Fast forward to the issues, our meals were dropped off.  Everyone started to dig into their meals. I cut my steak which was requested medium and it was at the very least well done & very dry. Normally this would not be a big issue, as the any good server stops by shortly after delivering the meals to make sure everything is good. Well our waitress did not stop by until everyone at our table, other than myself was done eating. I pointed out the issue with my steak and she told me she would get me another one, properly prepared. Well fast forward another 20 minutes and the manager stopped by with the replacement steak. He said \"I'll be back in a couple minutes to give you a chance to make sure everything is great.\"  Well that was the last time I say the manager. The new steak came out rare instead of the medium I requested, twice. Everyone after completing their meals and then waiting 20+ minutes for my steak had the opportunity to watch me eat my steak.  Overall very poor experience and customer service. This ruined everyone's meals. That was it, the manager never came back, no apology for messing up my steak or making everyone wait so long & no discount. Wow, very poor!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've been to in years! Their appetizer bread was so yummy and their steak was juicy and delicious! Their chicken strips were so yummy!!!! So juicy and flavorful! Went on a Saturday night so the wait was sort of long. Much expected at any restaurant on a Saturday at 6-6:30-7-8. Our waitress Brandi, was so sweet so definitely ask for her. She was like a track runner. We would ask for some more bread and she would be back with HOT bread in a minute! And she saw our drinks were getting low and brought us new ones without us asking her! She's a great waitress super sweet and on the ball! Definitely recommended call ahead tho!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 4 stars
Service - 4 stars
Food - 3 stars
My filet had no flavor and only seasoned with salt and pepper. My loaded baked potato had very little cheese or bacon."}
{"text":"My husband & I wanted to treat ourselves to a decent dinner & we did come to the right place. I ordered the Rib Eye & that was absolutely fantastic along with a baked potato & veggies. Hubby ordered his usual 10 oz Salmon. We had wonderful service also even though we did have to wait for awhile but the excellent meal made it that much better. We are going to going back here again real soon. I couldn't believe how outstandingly & very tasteful this steak was. It came the way that I ordered it \"medium with pink\"."}
{"text":"I need to lower my expectations when I eat at one of these so called \"Steakhouses\". The steaks are usually of lower quality cuts, and never cooked your preffered temp. Service is alway sub-par. However, this location has managed to drive my expectation even lower."}
{"text":"Sabrina is the best server ever.  She remembers what we like to drink and remembers that we just want salt and pepper seasoning on our entrees no \"bold\" seasoning. She there before we need anything and checks in just enough not to be bothersome.

Marvin, one of the managers, always stops by to say Hi and check on our experience.

Stephen, the managing partner, is so down to earth.  He really is interested that you have a great meal and service every time you come in to dine.

We've stopped going to any other steak places because the food and service are always on point at LongHorn Steakhouse on Cactus."}
{"text":"Just a great place. Were from Portland where there are restaurants on every corner,  this place has awesome service  (Ashley was our server) she is tops polite and kind.
The new York strip or the chopped steak it's all wonderful if ever back in Phoenix  will come back.
Hats off to the manager runs a tight back
THANKS ASHLEY keep that smile"}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate our 53 anniversary. The food was great and the treated us to a dessert to help celebrate   Ribeye steak was cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"Well I like the food and the barkeep! 
But the noise level here is outrageous!! 
People are dropping things all over the place!
So if you want a peaceful quiet place to eat this isn't it"}
{"text":"The food was good, but we didn't get all of our order. It was takeout, $70 worth and when I called in, Marvin the manager said he would upgrade our 1/3 rack of ribs which we never got to a half and give us an appetizer or dessert for forgetting our salad and ribs. It seemed a bit of a small gesture, a little too little too late. Maybe he's training? I mean, I paid for them and he offered to give me a couple more ribs for not getting any? Hmmmm"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service! The 40+min we waited for our food wasn't bad but while we waited for our food a waitress came to our table with the wrong food and when we were looking at each other to figure out who's plate had to have what the waitress said \"you'll have to figure it out\" and left two plates at our table then came back shortly and said this isn't yours so I'm taking it away while my brother was cutting the steak and didn't even bother to apologize for THEIR mistake. That was the worst thing out of all the other negative stuff."}
{"text":"I chose to dine here because it was close to where I was staying.

I first tried the sweet corn fritters, because I read on a review that they were delicious.  Sadly, the corn fritters were not as expected.  I was hoping for them to be sweeter, with more robust corn flavour.  However, the corn bits were gritty, and it otherwise tasted like simple, salty bread.  The dip that accompanied them was quite delicious, however.  I just didn't think it matched with the fritters.  I might also mention that the fritters were fried to a good degree.

The Cheddar Stuffed Mushrooms were very good, and baked to a great texture, with just the right amount of cheese on it.  It was a very simple dish, and also the only dish I thought was very good.

Each steak meal came with one side and a salad.  Everyone in my party's and my salad was very much overdressed.  I chose rice pilaf as my side, and it was far too salty.  The rice was cooked to a good texture, however.

My steak was as expected. I ordered it medium well, and it was served perfectly medium well.  I was overall satisfied with the steak in relation to its price.

The service was fine; the only setback was that the waiter forgot to give us plates for the appetisers.  Following that, the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Food was great but kinda expensive.  Dining room looks dirty with a lot of dirty tables.  Service was a little slow but she was very informative about the menu"}
{"text":"We've had lunch here before--almost ordered the same thing. On 01/06/2017 we decided to have lunch here. The parking lot is fairly large with available wide spaces for a SUV or truck. The restrooms are very clean! We were seated right away and given menus while our drinks were being prepared.. We ordered 2 gourmet hamburgers with seasoned fries. Fresh baked bread was served during our wait. The burgers were beyond GREAT--they had onions on top, white cheddar cheese and bacon Mayo. If you're in the mood for a great burger, this is the place. Total cost with drinks & tax was $30.22 with tip additional"}
{"text":"I Called ahead to find out serving times young lady told me until 11 and hung up. We arrived at 920pm waited for hostess. When he showed up he put us in a booth at bar and threw 2 menus on table. At least 10 waiters/waitress where in and out of kitchen and no one came to our table for 15 min.... needless to say we left!!! No service save yourself time go somewhere else first"}
{"text":"I had an amazing date planned with my girlfriend. We were given phenomenal service, the manager Summer was kind, checked in to see how we were . Great service ,caring staff, the food was amazing, we both had steaks cooked to perfection! We had dessert the key lime pie was so good, creamy. I will be going back without a doubt. I'd give the entire experience 5 stars on all. Thank you to all staff from wait staff to chef to manager!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a Darden restaurant.
Much like Olive Garden and Red Lobster, you know walking in exactly what you're going to get.
The bread is fresh, warm and tasty. The salad is fresh, cold and crisp.
The entrees are the Central Casting version of what they should be.
Nothing we had was bad, the steaks were cooked to the desired temp and were perfectly mediocre.
The decor was Texas steakhouse appropriate in the same way Olive Garden is stereotypical Italian appropriate and Red Lobster is stereotypical seafood appropriate.
There was nothing at all wrong with being there - but I'd rather have a less \"scientifically proven\" chain and a better steak.
At least the beer was cold and frosty. That makes a big difference on a Phoenix summer day, and that alone is the reason for the third star."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go to Longhorn for her birthday and we had yet to try them out.  We started in the bar for a couple of drinks and some appetizers.  For the appetizers we shared the Firecracker Chicken Wraps and the Housemade Chips & Dip.  The chicken wraps were their version of \"southwest egg rolls\" if you will.  They were tasty and served on a bed of lettuce but I thought the Chicken Wraps were a little small and what we got for the price, there are other appetizers to nosh on for a better value.  The Housemade Chips & Dip were phenominal!  Homemade potato chips with a homemade bbq dipping sauce.  These were half the price of the chicken wraps and you got more food.  I will definitely be ordering those again!

The rest of our party arrived so we went to our table to order dinner.  I had the Smoky Double Bacon Sirloin (6 oz.) with a side of seasoned french fries and a side salad all for $11.99.  Helluva deal too.  My steak was cooked to perfection (medium for me) and you got a plenty amount of seasoned fries with the skins still left on (you know it has to be good).  The steak was wrapped in bacon and also had bacon chunks with smokey Gouda and a 4 cheese sauce to top the steak.  Longhorn Steakhouse hit a grand slam with me on this dish with flavor, portions and value.  I also added on a grilled lobster tail for $10 more and it was goooooooood!  So for $22 I got a surf & turf, Caesar salad, choice of a side and AYCE honey wheat bread with whipped butter.  That's a hard bargain to pass up.

The restaurant was clean, the service was excellent & friendly.  I will be coming back for future lunch & dinners, no doubt about that.  Give Longhorn Steakhouse a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service and  atmosfear  and the tables are not on top of one another prices are very fair"}
{"text":"I usually never have any issues visiting this location. However with this visit, my ribs were lukewarm. They were not appealing at this temperature. The service was great, and so were my fries - as they were hot and fresh. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, she spoke highly of the Hawaiian salmon dish as a member of my party was eating theirs and how she really liked it. I plan to try that the next time I go."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family and I went there last night. The food was phenomenal! Our server was Studly Steve. He was hilarious! He made the experience 100x better. I got the ribeye steak. It was made exactly to my liking. The staff is always on their toes. The wait time was pretty short. We only waited 10 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I called in an order to go and showed up 25 minutes later. The bartender said that they never placed the order, they out it on hold by accident. She said she would put a rush on it and be 10 minutes. 25 minutes later and after excuses like a party of 14 was in and they had been caught up sending that out, my food came. I work in the industry and know things happen but a manager walked by twice with no attention to the situation or offer of any discount. I'm never looking for discounts and even still tipped on my to go order but the lack of attention and acknowledging that it was their mistake was very poor.  I guess that's what you can come to expect from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I seem to remember when I lived in Florida 10+ years ago that Longhorn was its own chain, wasn't it?  Stock symbol was LOHO.  That's fun to say.  Now they are part of the Darden Group.  Hmmm.....well I like the Yard House and would like to try Seasons 52 and The Capital Grille, but I think Red Lobster is a travesty.  I did a case study on the Darden Group years ago, and I'm not sure how I feel about Longhorn being part of it.  BUT.....where was I?  I should be writing a review.  

We had a great experience last night.  Our server, Keith, I believe was also the bartender and he was working his butt off.  He lets people know he'll be right with them, which is always appreciated, and he got our drinks right out to us and took our order quickly.  The place was starting to fill up and he had the bar area plus a few booths and he was all over it.  He did a great job.  And I have to admit I loved it when he got after some of the other staff for piling their ramekins, extra napkins, and misc. other items on the end of his bar.  You go Keith!  Get after those knuckleheads!

We had limited time so we just shared a side salad, the loaded baked potato soup, and the white cheddar & bacon stuffed filet entree.  Oh my.  That steak was very flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Here's the description on their menu:  A tender Flo's Filet stuffed with aged white cheddar and applewood smoked bacon, served over a savory brown herb sauce.  Delicious.  The vegetable medley side was very nice and fresh as well and included snow peas, squash, and broccoli.  Today I will be drinking 2 kale smoothies and taking extra fish oil tabs, but it was worth it.    

When we mentioned to Keith we had a concert to hit, he got the check taken care of right away.  Overall we had a very nice visit and I would be happy to go back."}
{"text":"Very texas-y! The decor and the ambiance scream \"HOWDY YA'LL.\" Food is good.  The fried calamari is not anything I had before.  Their steaks though are pretty good.  I got the sirloin with shrimp kabobs.  The shrimp is perfectly cooked and jumbo sized.  Overall, it's not the best steakhouse but it's good if you are craving steak I suppose.  A bit pricey but it's a steakhouse so no surprise there."}
{"text":"I called ahead and made a reservation for a party of 7 adults and 2 children. We arrive at the location and it was empty, we thought, well at least we'll get really good service since the waitress aren't busy. 
Unfortunately, we were wrong !!! 
First problem, there wasn't a table to sit all of without having us to feel all crammed. The worst part of it, the manager would walk on by and ignore us. 

Second, our waitress was just so monotone and not attentive at all. She only came to serve us our drink, write our orders, deliver orders, and give us the check. She didn't bother to come to see if we needed anything. In addition, she never smiled she just had an attitude 

Third, my sister wanted the signature dish the Maui, but the waitress didn't tell my sister ahead of time it wasn't available. So she orders a prime rib and for my nephew a side of Mac and cheese. 

Only good part of this experience was the food but overall service was a joke and would never come back again or would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst longhorn ever!! My salad include a LONG HAIR!! (Not mine)
El peor longHorn!! El servicio no fue bueno ni malo, el lunar esta  SUCIO!!  pero lo peor es q me salió un CABELLO y un cabello largoooooo (obvio no mio tengo el cabello cortisimo) EN MI ENSALADA!!, se disculparon diciendo \" perdón por el cabello pero así pasa\"  que? Seguí comiendo, la carne, estuvo mal el término pedí mediobien  (mediumwell) y era totalmente cocida, y después de todoooo eso me hicieron el descuento de no cobrarme mi carne, pero si la de mi acompañante q también tuvo los mismos problemas menos el cabello, el descuento en realidad fue de 12 dólares la verdad gratis hubiera sido caro!!  terrible experiencia, para NO VOLVER."}
{"text":"I frequently get take out from the bar. Russ is always here and what a professional! He works hard to make sure everyone is taken care of quickly and efficiently. He knows my name, knows what I drink and when he gives me a timeline on the food, he's dead on target. I love the Flo's filet and the veggies but Russ' customer service keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"A very busy location, this Independence Blvd Longhorn seemed to fall short of all the things that we would say mattered. 
From the hostess being snippety to the table service not being fabulous- it just seemed to be off. 

Maybe the Longhorn Pineville location has just spoiled us with their remarkable service, but 
Tonight's experience st the Independence location was just not good. 

The food was good but let's face it, the folks who run the place can make or break the experience. 
It was not great.  

Will we be back ?   Probably never
Will we visit Longhorn again ?Independence Blvd No way.  Never ."}
{"text":"We had a great meal . Always a pleasant visit when we visit Longhorn. Tonight was our anniversary. . The meal was exceptional as was the service!"}
{"text":"1st of all we are bar sitters. This is where it is just easier to sit and better service but this time not true. We go in mid afternoon, not busy at all, 1 person sitting at bar. Bar was nasty!! We had to request the bartender to clean the place we were sitting. So here we sit in a 2x2 square of cleaniness. 2nd bartender comes on duty, manager walks by several times..still not clean. Finally when 3rd bartender shows up, he mentions how dirty it was, i seconded and bartop was cleaned. Food was good, constantly had to repeat our order to every bartender. Will be be back? I dont know, we almost left when we got there. You would think manager would have cleaned it herself"}
{"text":"Steak COLD and not cooked. Medium Rare does not mean not cooked at all!
Unresponsive service. Had to listen to servers swear and complain just feet away from my table. Floor under and around table dirty. Hostess should have never seated us there. 
That was my first experience With this location. And probably my last."}
{"text":"Had flat iron steak, green beans and mashed potatoes. 

Steak was cooked perfectly med rare, green beans were cooked just enough so they didn't get mushy, and had bits of fresh tomato cooked with them. Mashed potatoes were delicious, if not served add hot as everything else. Sauce on steak is VERY peppery, which turned out to be fine--I just didn't expect it. 

The bread served at the table was warm, crusty on the outside, very soft in the inside. Nothing to write home about, but tasted fine.

Tried the dessert sampler just to assess. Also not worth a lot of home-bound stationery, but enjoyed the caramel apple gold rush most. The ice cream is very tasty. If you're a certifiederified Chocoholic, you'll appreciate the gooey chocolate stampede. Don't bother with the generic cheesecake with strawberry sauce..

Adored my waitress Alexus. She's young, but did a good job. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our experience here was mediocre.  The food was okay and the service was lacking.  There seems to be a disconnect between the servers and the runners of the food.  

We had a party of 4 and each of us ordered.  A different person (not our server) brought out our food and interrupted our conversation to ask everyone what they had ordered while holding the plates.  I can't stand that!

As we fumbled to remember what we each ordered, he handed my husband his plate.  He had ordered a flank steak but got a sirloin.  The server insisted it was flank steak.  My husband used to be a chef, it was not flank steak!  

I ordered my filet rare and it came out medium.  I was going to send it back but decided to just eat it rather than wait for another steak.  After the meal most of our dirty dishes were collected, but not all of them.  After getting tired of staring at the remaining dirty dishes we put them on the empty table next to us. 

We had to flag down the server for dessert and coffee.  As we were waiting for our dessert and coffee, another server (a runner) tried to deliver us 2 dinner plates!  Couldn't he see that we were a party of 4, not 2 and that we were done eating?!  

The management needs to ensure the runners know what tables they are delivering food to and what each guest is having.  We won't be back, Texas Roadhouse is MUCH better and less expensive."}
{"text":"We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share."}
{"text":"So after a bad experience a few years ago ... we came back. New management new menu ! Better experience! New fans ! 

We came for a steak dinner and that's just how it started... 

The special was a sirloin steak  6oz or you can order the 8oz (for a small upcharge)
It came with your choice of salad and  side plus dessert - all for $12.99 !

.We opted for the 6oz steak with salad and dessert . I had the turtle pie cheese cake - hubs had the chocolate peanut butter mousse  in a jar. 
The steak was really flavorful ( I was quite surprised) and the potato was a potato... can't really over expect much there. But the dessert ... that was so good! 
Yes we will say it was fabulous!
The server was attentive and the price was right ! Two thumbs up for a Thursday night dinner at Longhorn!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. I did have one problem that was corrected and confirmed by a manager. I ordered the new salt crusted NY Strip. Looked and smelled great but it was tough. Tougher than any steak I've had this year. The server picked up that steak and the manager brought out the new one. As soon as I cut into it I knew it was going to be much better and it was. A real treat for the taste buds.  This is a limited offering for the steak but it should have a good run."}
{"text":"After finishing my workout decided to hit up Longhorn since it was across from my gym and I definitely needed a big meal for I go to sleep!! 

Got here after 9pm there was about a 15-20 min I guess you can expect that since it was a Friday night. Finally we got seated the hostess was pretty nice. We got to our table and than the waiting started. Is like playing a game you get to the next station and than you wait till the whistle blows than you move!! So got to the table sat down than waited at least more than 5 min till our waitress finally decided to show up and asked us what we wanted to drink and asked us if we were ready to order. I guess she thought that if you let your customer wait before you introduce yourself they will be ready to place an order of what they want. Got our drinks than put our order in. We got the white cheese stuffed mushroom as a appetizer than for our meal we got the Porterhouse for 2 a 30oz steak. 

So the food was great!! For me I love mushrooms so the app was pretty amazing and than our Porterhouse was just amazing too. Grilled right not too burnt and it melted like butter when I would cut into the steak. Overall the food was great. The reason I gave it 3 stars tho is because we never really got any attention. Only time we got attention is when the food came out and when it was time to ask if we want any dessert and anything else. My water was never refilled and it was empty, pretty sure my waitress saw it. But I guess she thought since I was done eating I didn't want any more water. Would I go back? Yea I would go back for the food and hopefully I get someone different as a waitress. Also could be since it was getting close to closing time."}
{"text":"I was craving a steak since I was in Texas last week and had an amazing ribeye. So I came and got an amazing prime rib. The only downfall, the server, Caitlin P. didn't do a great job.  I only saw her once. When I paid for my bill someone else brought it out. It's whatever.  I will come back, just need to make sure I get a different server. Potato was good and prime rib cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday here this weekend & were all very impressed with the delicious food, generous portions (**Special deal 2 for $25**) and friendly service!

We got a perfect \"round\" table for 8 in the back..it was so nice to be able to see & talk with everyone. We shared all the delicious appetizers...
like the Spinach Dip with chips..it was VERY cheeesy..
Sweet Potato bites & Texas Toasted Onions

Everyone had Steaks prepared perfectly..but I had to be DIFFERENT! 
& got the \"Parmesan Crusted Chicken\" 
( I know..I know..  at a 'STEAK' house???)
But it was absolutely delicious & so was the buttery Cinnamon sugar \"SWEET potato\"!

and..the sweetest ending to our delicious FEAST..
a HUGE, towering double \"CHOCOLATE STAMPEDE\" !!!
Which was 2 HUGE pieces of 6 layered Chocolate Mousse Cake with 2 big scoops of vanilla Ice Cream...enough to share with the whole table..but they had all ordered their own treats..like the  Bananas Foster Sundae, the SMORES Brownie and the fresh-baked Caramel Apple Pie...all delicious! 
Looks like we found a favorite place to celebrate Birthdays!! :)
We all left STUFFED & satisfied with smiles :)"}
{"text":"We went here because we had a gift card and were pleasantly surprised. It was really good. And my enchiladas (which I couldn't find now when I look through the menu online) were from the healthy options category but they sure didn't taste like it.  Service was awesome. But I think we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. There was a 10 minute wait but it's a Sunday at noon, so I won't complain. Was seated quickly when a table became available. 
My steak was as ordered and delicious, the shrimp was tasty. My husband had pork chops & an ear of corn that looked really tasty. Our loaded fries were good to & they're not even on the menu anymore. 
Atmosphere was nice, the place was crowded but not annoyingly so. 
All in all I enjoyed my meal & the service."}
{"text":"Food is OK, not as good as it used to be.  The only steak worth getting is the filet, the others are just average.  Sides and salads are fine and the free bread is good.  I've tried a couple desserts and they were all great.  Atmosphere is clean and the staff friendly enough.  Overall this place is a bit overpriced for what you get, but still worth the occasional visit."}
{"text":"Very, very slow service.  Food was good but only if you have all night.  They said we would be seated in 5 minutes it took 20.  Took 10 minutes before we even saw a sever after being seated and our entrees came out 55 minutes later!  Not kidding!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a Darden chain restaurant, but call it a guilty pleasure.  First, they cook the steaks the way your order them - rare comes back rare (which, in itself is a rare thing).  The salads are old school (iceberg lettuce, tomato, onion, croutons), but the bleu cheese dressing is nice.  The bread is tasty.  The sides are good (and hearty).  This is a fun place to go.  Our waiter on this visit was awesome as well - really added to a nice night out."}
{"text":"The manager was very nice when our food was not cooked properly. Additionally, our waitress was very kind to our party of 7. The only issue was some of the food. One person in my parties steak did not taste like a steak - more like a hamburger. Also had to send back two steaks because they were very underdone. Food was a bit salty, especially the hamburger. In the men's restroom there was a missing tile with chipping glue that was supposed to hold on. Overall, was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Short Review: Crap service, good steaks on a budget and GREAT desserts.

I'm too cheap and like too much variety to go to a traditional steak house with my family. My kid is the only huge steak nut. My wife and I are happy with appetizers, sandwiches and desserts. After reading reviews and checking out similar new-fangled steak joints, I settled for the horn. 

We got their early (lunch) and we were one of three tables. A stupid restaurants do, they fill up one section 1st with other servers (pretending to look busy). The service was mediocre pretty bad. The server, Kiki was saccharine and when you gave her a little window, she'd talk about having teenage kids (read -- I NEED your tips).  She did not make eye contact either. Strange. She also took the order of a table seated after us before ours (even though we had our menus placed in the corner of the table). The old folks seemed to like her, but they are easily pleased, I guess. 

We had the the lobster and shrimp dip with chips for the appetizer. It was cheesy, buttery and thick with shrimp and lobster meat. Yum!

My kid pigged out and had New York Strip and the Firecracker Chicken app. His steak was cooked perfectly medium. The taste and quality of the meat exceeded expectations. The app was also tasty.

I had the prime rib sandwich. It was perfect with the horseradish and side of tangy barbecue sauce. I regretted sharing it with my wife except she shared her mouth-watering Grilled Chicken and Stuffed Port. The sweet potato with butter and cinnamon (side) was a pleasant (albeit somewhat unusual for this area) pre-dessert. 

The dessert puts this restaurant over the top. We had the sampler. It included a six-chocolate cake, mouth drop-kicking strawberry cheesecake (perfectly sweet/tart) and my favorite The Caramel Apple Gold Rush ... great like a caramel apple on Dessert Growth Hormone. 

I got all of this for $71. This was extremely reasonable. The problem with the restaurant though is not that it's a chain steakhouse, it's its inept service and service management. I would never come in during a busy period because it may become a disaster."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, something always gets messed up every time we dine, HOWEVER there is a male manager there who is amazing, he truly will bend over backwards to make you happy and this manager makes the difference in this review.  The food always tastes out standing no quams there except this steak sandwich they used to offer....it was dry. But like I said this manager makes all the difference. I don't know his name but he really should be a model for all managers in this chain and all similar chains. If we are in an area that has a long horn and we are less than an hour and a half from home and want a great experience, we will actually drive to the one where this manager works as we have gone to one else where and it didn't compare"}
{"text":"Two people had steaks and enjoyed them.  I tried the spaghetti squash.  Had never tried something like this before so have nothing to compare. But it was dry and basically didn't have any taste.  Stuffed mushrooms were excellent with the melted cheese."}
{"text":"Sunday night, 530.  Empty tables but HD to wait to get seated.  Should have been the first clue there wasn't enough help.  15 minute wait at table for waiter.  And they ran out of bread and there was none left in the store.  What?  Food was OK but swimming in butter.  Long time before I go back."}
{"text":"Yelpers, the manager I just talked to said she and all the managers do not care about what \"yelpers\" have to say. No, thanks. Read the reviews about poor service and decided to call an ask if there were any improvements made and \"ros\" the manager said she doesn't care about those reviews and of course she's aware of her staff. I asked about the wait and she said is about a two hour wait right now and at least 30 minutes to get food once you're seated.  Personally, I love Yelp and it has never let me down.  This manager's poor attitude was just one of the reasons we will not even make an attempt to visit this place. Thanks, Yelpers!! I care what you have to say :)"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of food and I love their steaks. Every time I eat there I have the chicken bite appetizer and the steak medium cooked. They never disappoint and their bread is great too. The only complaint if any would be the speed of the food sometimes. A couple of times I have been there we had to wait quite a bit for our food but they were pretty busy. Other than that this place is awesome and they have great prices too."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent. Service was great as well and Allison at the host stand was super friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. My daughter never says anything about her food and she loved the steak and Parmesan chicken combo."}
{"text":"While I have enjoyed the food here on other occasions I am disappointed in Longhorns recent service. They recently had told a group of us a few weeks before our reservation that they would be able to accommodate a party of 20 and on the day of the gathering they changed at the last minute and said they couldn't accommodate us and left us high and dry on Valentine's Day weekend to find a restaurant to accommodate a large party. I'm very disappointed in this poor customer service and lack of consideration. You've lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Went to lunch at LongHorn on Sunday.  I had the mixed salad with Salmon and my husband had steak, creamed spinach and salad.  The food was fine and the service was fine.  Nothing outstandingly great or poor.  Average all the way around."}
{"text":"Good service and pretty good steak, my potato came out cold, the butter wouldn't melt, they were wiling to bring out another, but I wasn't  hungry enough to put them through the trouble. With other choices for good steak, I'd likely not make this my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice before and when I leave I always wonder how it's stayed in business so long. Their menu is generally boring and the food is below average. On my visit today 4 of us were jammed into a bar booth and \"greeted\"  by a miserable middle aged woman that appeared to hate life. It's amazing what people find acceptable. In any case I will try not to make a fourth visit."}
{"text":"I don't know why there have been so many poor reviews for this particular Longhorn... It's my favorite chain restaurant, and this location has NEVER given me a bad meal.  The servers are always friendly, and we have a great time every single time. 

One of my very favorite dishes in the world is the firecracker chicken wrap appetizer from here... the right amount of spice and cool with the cucumber crema on top.  I also enjoy the bacon and cheddar stuffed filet, the Parmesan crusted chicken, and even something as simple as the chicken fingers.  The sides are seasoned nicely (I love the mashed potatoes), and the salads always seem fresh.  

We come here far too often for our own good, but it's just delicious!"}
{"text":"So I've come to this location many times and never have I had such a terrible experience as last night. Our server was great; we sat at the bar in a high top table and our Moscow mules and margaritas we're very tasty. But the food was unbelievably disappointing. An expected 6 oz medium well filet arrived burnt with no flavor and you could barely chew it. The recovery steak was just as awful. Manager was not welcoming or apologetic and basically dropped the dish off and left. The lobster tail had two bites in it, if that. The prime rib was all disgusting fatty fat that was probably the most disappointing because of the amount we paid for two bites of tough meat. We also ordered the chicken wraps and we could not even eat them because they were so gross. Like I've said we've never had an experience like this but we did not leave as happy customers."}
{"text":"This is our new spot where my husband will be regulars.  We tried this place on a whim one random date night and have been back 4x since. They are a chain but we appreciate the consistency that comes with that. 

I have the strawberry lemonade, the porterhouse (always cooked correctly and with a delicious seasoning) and either the baked potato or sweet potato. Comes with side salad (amazing ranch dressing & homemade croutons). Every time it's great. 

My husband has tried the ribs, prime rib, filet, surf & turf. He says they're all very good. 

The finishing touch is always the AMAZING chocolate stampede dessert. 

Always great service, great food and we'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently ate at the Longhorn Steakhouse in Concord, NC.  We received great service and were impressed with the food as well.  I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  Also I was impressed with the Managing Partner, Jack Vanston.  While we were there he was visible and stayed on top of things around the restaurant and I didn't see anyone goofing off.  Everyone was polite and our food came out in a reasonable time.

I would like to add that about a month prior to this night we had eaten at Texas Land and Cattle.  I had heard that Land and Cattle was a really nice place.  We were not impressed.  The staff was snooty, the portions were skimpy and the smoked flavor was so thick in the air it smelled like someone was smoking a cigar in the next booth.  Seriously, I was looking around to find someone smoking and then I realized it was my food.  I like smoky but not that smoky.  Since we have been to longhorn we have a totally new idea of what a \"Really Nice\" Texas style steakhouses should be.

{"text":"Unbelievable food and amazing service, Anthony was the brightness I needed in my day. Ask for him the next time you visit, I know I will!"}
{"text":"Love the steaks here.  Flo's filet is the one to get.  Friendly staff and the place seems clean.  The only negative I will say is the parking lot was not thought out properly - too small.  Will go back for more steaks again."}
{"text":"Came in at 1pm on a Thursday and they were surprisingly busy. I sat at at the bar and was taken care of very quickly. Fast and friendly and my steak was cooked perfectly. And I recommend the firecracker chicken wraps for an appetizer. Overall a great experience $$$."}
{"text":"Ok here is what i have to say 

5 stars all the way !!! Service very good..  steak even better!!! I ve been to high end steak houses in countless places and usually you get what you pay for.  In this case the food and service should cost fourtimes as much.  Give it a try you will be pleasantly surprized !"}
{"text":"We had dinner here Friday night and surprised we could just walk in and be seated right away at 7:00 when the one near the Paradise Valley Mall would be at least a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere is nice and everyone was friendly. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was delicious. It was however the first time I have ever been asked what size chicken I wanted- 9 ounces or 12 ounces. We have been to a location closer to home before and they have never asked that. My husband had the ribs and he said they were delicious and our friend had the prime rib which he seemed to enjoy. Our son had the grilled cheese and he said it was yummy. We all had the Caesar salad and it was ok, just nothing special. At other locations they automatically bring bread for the table but we had to ask for it here. The server was also a little slow on the drink refills."}
{"text":"We come here at least 2 times a month and are server Linex  was great!!! He was friendly, fast and had a great personality. Food was great we had a little issue the temperature of are steak, but it was not only taken care of but the General Manager but she also gave my father a drink on the house!! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Best experience did the call ahead and only waited 15 minutes during peak time. Server was awesome and friendly. Food was delicious. Just a great dinner night."}
{"text":"I had an 18 oz. ribeye steak at Longhorn during the week of April 9, 2017.  At $25.49, served w/salad and choice of potato, whole wheat bread and butter, well, it was very tasty.  The steak was prepped exactly as I requested and it was very flavorful.  I was unable to finish it so I took half home for steak salad the next day.  The steak was very enjoyable sliced thin and served cold on a salad the next day.  Service was very good.  Atmosphere, for my taste, is way too kid friendly.  I prefer not to dine surrounded by fussing children.  This is what I'd classify as a family oriented steakhouse.  Unfortunately, though the price and product are both quite good, I'd rather pay more and go to a proper steakhouse where there are not lots of kids.  The extra cost makes for a much more enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"We thought the service and food was good. Nothing exceptional, but an enjoyable meal. 

The pretzel beer cheese has a very strong ale taste. Parmesan crusted chicken was flavorful. Top Sirloin was good. 

No complaints but also not something that I'd rush back to."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 5:00 pm. The restaurant wasn't very busy. We were greeted quickly by Ashley, and she was super sweet and really patient, as we took a minute to make up our minds. We ordered the fried green tomatoes appetizer, and We ordered the porterhouse steak for 2. I got a Caesar salad and loaded baked potato as my side, and my boyfriend ordered the mashed potatoes and roasted corn on the cob. We ordered the steak medium rare. Everything was delicious!! The tomatoes were hot and full of flavor, the steak was cooked perfectly, and the potato was covered with toppings and hot! We wanted dessert, so we ordered the chocolate stampede and it was HUGE!! I think we took about 4 bites each and I ended up taking the rest home with me, as I'm th chocolate lover. Very good first impression from Longhorn steakhouse for me!! They aren't nearly as expensive as Ruth Chris, or other steak houses and the food is just as good, if not better. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"This place should absolutely get a zero star, horrible service.  We got there, 5:45 on a Sunday. 15+ tables open and they couldn't seat us because they were down servers but yet, 3 servers were sitting around, doing nothing. Don't go here.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"The rib eye was delicious, super tender and fatty (which I love!) But the New York strip was less flavorful in my opinion. A little salty, but that happens at a lot of steakhouses. Prices run about $20 for a steak. There's an upcharge for the special sides, but the asparagus was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible!  My second time here and both times they have been out of prime rib!  I ordered shrimp and it was black and burnt, the bake potato was raw!  The sad part is the manager didn't even stop by to apologize for the disgusting food!! I will never come back.  If you ever want prime rib go to Charleston's."}
{"text":"Tonight was not our first time here but one of our better meals there. We went in for the $12.99 special which was a salad, 6 ounce steak with side and your choice of an appetizer or dessert. They also bring out Brad and butter for the table while you are waiting for dinner. I had the Caesar salad and the sweet corn fritter appetizer. On their own the fritters were just ok but with the spicy sauce they were delicious. My husband had the spicy chicken bites which were also good. Both of us enjoy our steaks. I had the mashed potatoes on the side and he had the loaded baked potato. Neither of us had any complaints and we both cleaned our plates. Our son had the cheeseburger kids meal which he said was fine. He tends to be picky so it's hard to say what his review means. Dinner for 3 with sodas was only $40 not including the tip which is a deal!

On previous visits I have had the Parmesan crusted chicken which is quite good."}
{"text":"Ask for Brad !  Most delightful server we have had in a while . Ask for a Bloody Mary , extra spicy & extra dirty and he made sure the Bartender made it as requested. Our salads were prepared as ordered with the dressing on the side Our entrees were perfect  with my Prime Rib was cooked to order a perfect Medium Rare. Thumbs up to great service & good food ."}
{"text":"Meh. Expected more, got less. Just the two of us, they told us the wait was 25min, ended up being 45. While we waited there were constantly 5-6 tables open the whole time that they weren't seating. So who knows what their reasoning was behind that. I ordered the prime rib and the server said he'd have to check to see if they were out of it yet or not because it goes quick. He turns to the manager walking by and asked her, she said yea we've been out of it for a while now. Dude it was only 7:00 on a Saturday. Oh well. So once we ordered it took about 20-25min just for us to get our salads. Guess they had to harvest all the lettuce and vegetables for our salads which is why it took so long? Steaks were really good, but nothing I couldn't have grilled myself, which is why I wish they hadn't run out of the prime rib, my first choice. 
So probably won't be going back there, rather go to black angus or even outback if we want steaks or prime rib. It was just the long wait, which wasn't necessary, the wait for our salads, and then running out of prime rib. Plus whoever designed the inside of the restaurant didn't know what they were doing, it was just one big dining room, and a tiny bar area. I've seen chiles and Applebee's set up better than this small place."}
{"text":"Twice and third time we struck out
This is a chain restaurant with managers supervisors etc
Does any one care that this place treats customers like pigs in a slaughter house
They take your cash and who cares if you come back.another sucker walks in
Service and food are far from acceptable."}
{"text":"Terrible steak - had the Outlaw Ribeye.  It was tough and gristly with little flavor.  Ordered it medium and it came par medium and part rare. Ate the medium part and sent the rare back to be cooked . It came back hot but still there. Service was slow and indifferent.  Didn't get drink refill - had to ask and it took a long time to get it. Took 20 min to get the salad.  For the price, it was terrible overall."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was really craving a ribeye steak. It had been a few months since I had one at a restaurant. It was lunch time, and surprisingly the usual couple places that serve amazing rib eyes weren't open for lunch. Doing a quick search I found that Longhorn was open. I ordered the ribeye (not the outlaw one), and it cost about $20. I asked for it medium rare. What I got was a steak that was barely an inch thick and cooked medium. It was DOUSED in butter, no doubt to hide the fact it was overdone and dry. I could only choke down half because it was so thin and over cooked. I was shocked how thin it was, the only place I've seen rib eyes so thin is Walmart, which makes me wonder if that's where they purchase their meat. If they consider themselves a steakhouse, price their steaks as such, then they better get decent cuts of meat and teach the cook staff how to cook it properly. If that was the first steak of my life I would forever hate steak. Go anywhere else if you want a steak because they have no clue what they're doing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary.  So glad we did.  We both got the filet and baked potato.  Both were very flavorful.  Even our garden salads were good. Most places skimp on red onions, croutons, and cucumbers.  Not this place.  I tried the pina colada drink, which was really good.  Our server did a great job too. We will definitely be back. I think this place is better than Outback if you asked me."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came on a Thursday night and it was the perfect crowd size. Our waiter was attentive and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The Parmesan crusted asparagus is AMAZING!!!  Hailey is AWESOME...she's always so friendly!  This is a GREAT place and the ratings should be a lot higher."}
{"text":"Management needs to help out the servers and clean up the tables and the floor
The front of the house was a pig pen
I was told the manager was working the kitchen. Ok. Call another server in to help clean up or have the staff step up and clean up as they walk past dirty tables in stead of ignoring them.  Hope this location gets organized"}
{"text":"Great Service and a friendly staff even when they are busy you still get a seat fairly quick. Their food is good as well I have yet to order something I don't like! Do yourself a favor and give them a visit."}
{"text":"First experience and will be the last. The small Bacon cheese burger and fries was not prepared properly with bacon missing. Fries were lukewarm. Friend had to send back. I had the Napa chicken. Tasteless. Topping skimpy and sauce with little flavor. Portions small. Especially the burger. 12.49 for a burger and fries. Really? Salad was thrown in a bowl with one of them with not a complete portion. Did comp the meals but have no desire to ever go back. Very little folks there as well. Left hungry and so disappointed."}
{"text":"Server, Stephanie G, made our night! We were visiting from out of state, had a delicious meal, watched some NASCAR in the bar, and had A+ service! What more could you ask for!?!"}
{"text":"Despite all the bad reviews I was wanting to eat here. Knowing it would either be a hit or miss. 

The food was good I'm not gonna lie but the restaurant/service in general sucked. The floor was pretty disgusting, and the manager was talking crap about other employee's pretty loud lol. 
We didn't even get our servers name but he was pretty friendly-a little rushed.
It took 10 minutes for him to greet us. 
15 minutes for us to get out drinks.
30 minutes for us to get our salads.
Then 5 minutes after having our salad's we got our food. 

If I was just going off the food it would've been 5 stars but the environment is 2 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch and left so full I didn't want to go back to work! Service and food was great and the prices were decent"}
{"text":"We stopped in after an event nearby. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli as a side and my husband has a filet Mignon. 

My chicken, covered in saucy cheesy yumminess was off the hook! I could only eat half, which meant I had leftovers. Woot!

As for my husband, I forgot to remind him that they put heavy seasoning on their steaks, which he doesn't prefer so he thought it was \"meh\". 

Service was promptly, friendly and full of personality, which I always enjoy."}
{"text":"This place has great food, a bit pricey but worth the money. I would choose this steak house over any other in this area. Great service, staff is always friendly. I love the filet magnon and lobster tail!"}
{"text":"Went to this place today with the mrs..  Restaurant is new, barely opened, so, it's very clean.  Ambiance is very nice. Lunch time menu is quite complete and very good and nicely priced.  Wife and I had a soup (cheese and broccoli) and a sandwich.  Mine a shaved steak with chimicuri sauce.  She: a cheese and broccoli with a prime rib sandwich.  Had iced tea which cost almost as much as a meal.  Note:order water when you go.  Sandwich was perfection for both of us.  Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.
Service was above excellent.  Very friendly wait staff...very well trained.
Drawback as I see it is that while it's open on Sunday, they only use the supper menu which is costlier and with larger portion sizes.  The wife and I, being older prefer the luncheon size portions...not because theyre cheaper but because we just don't eat that large a meal.
The Longhorn is an exceptionally fine restaurant nestled in between two other steak houses neither of which can hold a candle to the Longhorn."}
{"text":"Horrible,horrible service!   Ate at the bar tonight.  Had to wait for my salad until 2 minutes before the food arrived.  Only reason the salad was delivered was I had to ask on the status. No follow up on if everything was ok and the Dirty dishes were never cleaned off.   There were only five customers at the bar!
The worst part of all was the surprise when the bill came.   On her own the server, Adriana charged me for a premium salad and side dish.   When questioned about it she knew she was caught but at this point.....what's the use.   
Stay away from this place.   Rip off."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 2:30 on a Saturday and the place was pretty quiet. We were seated quickly and eventually ordered-filet and lobster and a ribeye with a baked and a sweet potato. The food was AWESOME! The seasoning on the meat was just fantastic! Our steaks were perfectly medium rare. Surprisingly good was the fresh bread brought to the table!

Near the end of our meal the manager stopped by a second time to check on us and we explained it was our anniversary and were also celebrating my fiancés passing of the dental boards. The manager was incredibly generous and gave us each a piece of chocolate dessert to go!!!

The only reason we took off a star on our review was because of how slow our server was. Yes, she was the only server at the time and she got slammed with about 7 tables in a 30 minute period, but she was a bit slow. As a former server, I'd recommend finding a way to be more efficient and save yourself some trips. It was nice to see two managers come out and help her when it got busy."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner. We were seated right away in a comfortable booth. I had the 6 oz sirloin 11.99 that came with a salad and a loaded baked potatoe. The steak was done perfectly and unbelievably tender and bursting with flavor. The potatoe was super good too, fresh not dried out or over baked!!  When they say loaded they mean loaded, butter, sour cream cheese and bacon. The salad was fresh and delish with plenty of cucumber ,tomatoes and croutons. All you can eat fresh baked bread! My friend had the shaved prime rib sandwich that I tried it was also very good!
Service was great. No complaints  we will be back."}
{"text":"Steak was great, creamed spinach too. But noticed while they clean off tables they don't wipe stuff off the shakers. Husband asked for pepper, which I replied you sure? Food good, cleaning not so good."}
{"text":"Not good service. They screwed up our to-go order. Fought with us on the phone about fixing it. Came back to the restaurant a 2nd time to pick up what they had forgotten. Went straight to the hostess explained why I was there. Waited another half hour till I had to say something to the hostess again. finally got the rest of my order. 
I realize this is a corporate chain and with that you get employees to don't care because they've got no skin in the game. This was just not what I was expecting for the prices they charge for their food.wont be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"One of the better Longhorn's I've been to.  The service is usualy pretty good.  It's obviously slower service when they're busy.  But I really like this Longhorns."}
{"text":"I'm heading home soon and will see if there is one of these on NCAL. For now, proximity to a hotel I plan to stay at often means frequent returns to the exhaustive menu. Tonight is lighter fare (until dessert) with a loaf of their famous bread..."}
{"text":"After a few tries and fails, Longhorn has finally gotten it together. Our food always come out hot and fresh and on time and no more over done steaks. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The bartender Danny always goes out of his way to make us welcome and make sure our food is correct."}
{"text":"due to my last review of this location, i was given a $100 gift card to make up for my previous experience here.. so i used it today during lunchish time 7/20/14 (sunday). i wasn't sure what to expect, but was surprised to see more than 1 table occupied considering it was lunch time, and when i went b4 for dinner on a thurs, it was practically empty... i guess it's busier on the wkends, and i was pleasantly surprised that the service/food was even better too! 

i got the porterhouse (20oz steak) w/ mash & mixed greens salad, and the molten lava cake for dessert (normally i get the chocolate stampede but i was kinda full and didn't think it would survive til i got home hrs later considering it's july in phx az!). i'd always wanted to try the other desserts at this restaurant so i'm glad i was finally able to lol, btw at the waitress' suggestion and she was right on :) 

i ordered the steak med well and it came to me med rare, so they didn't mind heating it up more and i had 2 ppl (the manager brought the reheated steak, and the waitress) ask if the steak was done better this time, and i was glad to say it was fine.. the taste was tons better (b4 i got the prime rib and it was majorly salty!) and the molten lava cake did not disappoint.. from now on, i'll have to debate which dessert to get! lol.. 

anyway, this time they showed me they cared abt the quality and my customer satisfaction :) at my last visit, this was not really the case.. so it's nice to see that at least during this time period on sunday that the service and food r tons better! maybe they tightened their ship or changed management? but either way, i'm satisfied and will try to use the rest of the gift card here soon! :)"}
{"text":"to start, i asked for a booth AWAY from the bar and what we got was a booth NEXT to the bar.. i personally have severe sensitivity/allergy to alcohol to the point that the smell of it highly affects me, so i didn't feel listened to by the host who chose our booth.... and while the waiter was really nice and knowledgeable, he did not check on the table often enough because finished dishes and glasses stayed at the table too long in some cases. also, i was with two other people and their entrees were sub par. their baked potatoes were severely lacking. one had to use her shrimp's melted butter to add it herself to the baked potato... and the other, his steak had too much fatty parts that were inedible so clearly a waste of money for him in ordering a steak. also, with my meal, i got the mashed potatoes as a side and the portion size was really poor as well, very pathetic looking next to the large porterhouse steak i ordered. the other diners were also not keeping their children at the table, so they were running wild around the floor and making it hard to hear each other when we were talking. other diners with children really should have better handle of their children so as not to disturb other diners. sadly, this was the first time going to the longhorn steakhouse for the other two people in my party and they were highly disappointed with their experience. i know we will not be going to this location again. i personally love longhorn steakhouse but the ones i've experienced while in AZ have been severely lacking in food and service sadly. the one i always went to when i lived in boston (the fenway location) is much better all around. it's a shame this was their first impression and even more sad this was the 2nd time in a row that i've been disappointed by AZ longhorn locations. we will have to choose another restaurant to go to from now on."}
{"text":"Longhorn Steakhouse in Matthews is my favorite steak restaurant, the service is great, the food is delicious everything is top of the line. I had the 8oz sirloin with mushrooms and onion the steak was perfectly cooked melted in my mouth. It comes with a salad the dressing is homemade and yummy. I also had the chopped steak 10 oz. of fresh ground beef, grilled and smothered with mushrooms, savory rosemary garlic sauce and crispy onion straws wonderful taste as well. My favorite writer is Sonny ask for him, he'll take great care of you, and if you have room the delectable Chocolate Stampede for dessert Six types of chocolate in peaks and layers that are served with vanilla bean ice cream. You will be in chocolate haven!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a meal at this restaurant*. The staff, from the Host to the waitstaff (who all helped each other out to make sure customers were taken care of in a timely manner), was on point, and our server, Stephanie, anticipated our every need. I got the lamb chops with horseradish potatoes and the meal was phenomenal! I am looking forward to returning soon! 

*We went at about 3:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  It was busy, but not yet crazy busy.  It was starting to fill up when we were leaving about an hour later."}
{"text":"Never again... 1 hr for a party of eight . Over cooked steak ,crunchy rice ,gluey spinach dip ,yuck ! Our waiter was high as a kite off of something ."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had such a wonderful experience. It was a much needed date night and I was craving a steak. Long Horn did not disappoint.  I had the Flat Iron Steak with the Stuffed Portobello mushroom, and I am so happy I did.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ever , it was a Sunday night , because the wait at Olive Garden was way too long , and I'm glad that happened because I would have never thought to stop here & I was not disappointed at all. It looked seemed like a slow night , parking lot was not too packed and there was no wait at all. When we walked in , I noticed that there wasn't a host up there , figured she was sitting others , but we were immediately greeted by another server that had finished taking a tables order, which I really appreciate, there after the host took us to our table, and about a minuet or two passed where out server Elizabeth B. Introduced herself, she was amazing , I can stress how much excellent service my family and I revived from her out of all the other restaurants I've been to or any business , she gave the best customer service. Anyways I ordered the prime rib , medium well with mashed potatoes and the garden salad , which all came out delicious , my 3 years old daughter got the hot dog and fries , which she ate the majority of it so I'm assuming she enjoyed it too, my daughter enjoyed the all the attention she was getting from our server , she was nice enough to put her order in a few minuets before ours so my daughter got her food first , which Is a smart server technique in my opinion , everything was just perfect that Sunday night, even the price , for it being my first time , I will definitely be returning more often '"}
{"text":"Rodney our bar server was great! He really took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed."}

Pretty good! I had a gift card so me and the roomy went here for dinner tonight. We both got the 12 oz prime rib with salad and baked potatoes. The salad was fresh, crisp, and cold and the ranch was tasty - 2 kinds of lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese. The bread was okay; warm but the butter was so cold it could not be spread. The prime rib was good - cooked nicely, cut thickly. The baked potato was on the cold side and pretty small. So for food - 3.5 stars

Service was excellent. We never wanted for anything and we were seated quickly with no wait for the bill.

Total $50 for 2 dinners.

09/27/15

Went again for dinner tonight and ordered their American Steak Special - $12.99 for a sirloin, salad, appetizer and a side. The salad only had iceberg this time, it was okay, nothing special. It was served ice cold in a chilled bowl which helped. The appetizer corn fritters had too much batter but the spicy ranch was really good. Loaded baked potato was typical. The star of the show was the sirloin, cooked perfectly medium-rare, served hot, and nicely seasoned. If they keep offering specials like this I will keep going as it's good value for the money and the meat is always good."}
{"text":"We frequent this place alot and have to say they do a great job with food consistency. It may take a while to get it but when it comes out it is wonderful. Their bartender Leslie is amazing. It's very rare to find a employee that gives exceptional customer service with a smile all day, everyday. The restaurant has a cool semi western theme going on. Wish they would bring the peanuts back it is a nice added touch when your waiting for your food to arrive."}
{"text":"The outlaw ribeye is awesome! It would be better if putting mushrooms on top. Saturday lunch wait time less 30 min."}
{"text":"Got the half rack of baby back ribs.. We're very dry and tasteless .. The appetizers were large but greasy .... Salad was fair... Waitress very attentive .. Should have got the steak!"}
{"text":"We were told the wait was 20 min even though there were 10 empty tables - menu is NOT vegan friendly waitress not helpful with substituting would not recommend or come back"}
{"text":"Great food and service, Woody is hilarious and able to make the restaurant feel like home. The food is amazing and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"This place sucks, overpriced and no flavor, its really a zero star place. If you like taste less chain restaurants go here, it is one of those chili's or red lobster or some such"}
{"text":"I honestly enjoyed this location better than the one in Rock Hill South Carolina. Which the service is a lot slower there than here. And this was during a busy hour on a Saturday.

Our server was very friendly and definitely made us feel welcomed during our visit. Our appetizer and dinner also came out at a very reasonable time and pace as well.

We started with some Texas Tonions, I love them better than Blooming Onions to be honest. They have their own signature sauce for them but I prefer ranch with them.

I got the shaved prime rib sandwich and substituted the fries with a loaded baked potato and a side order of broccoli. Everything was seasoned well and really good and I loved the sauce for the prime rib sandwich. The prime rib has to have the sauce. It's a must have.

My girlfriend got the 8 oz. renegade sirloin with fries and a salad. The steak was really good and cooked to her expectations of medium rare. But the fries were bland and needed more salt and were not really warm. And her salad had too much ranch dressing in it.

Other than that this location of Longhorn met up to our expectations and at a decent price and we will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"upgraded to soup and a spider crawled off my plate half way through my appetizer

Server told manager and manager never came by. It was not busy and we where there over an hour.  I went to her after my check was presented to me with a $1.69 discount. I asked if she knew that I had a spider on my plate that was the size of a dime. She said \"oh no it was not a dime I saw it squished in the napkin, it was tiny, but no worry I took care of you\" yes I am sure it looked tiny as a pile of bug guts, mind you we had to see that before we ate...

In addition my prime rib seemed to be cooked hours and hours ago and then Re-heated. Super tough and no juice at all...I make it better myself and I am no chef.

I recommended Texas road house next door. It is much more family oriented and the food is fantastic compared to this place. Oh and the manager comes by your table every visit just to ask how everything is and if the service is good."}
{"text":"Still great service and excellent food. We have never had a meal at Longhorn that we did not enjoy and have always had excellent service. Try the Prime rib sandwich and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes, this a chain, something I don't usually enjoy or patronize, but still an amazing place ! The food was awesome, the restaurant was absolutely spotless, including the bathrooms, and front of house staff was friendly and welcoming.

We had steaks - T-bone for him, Flo's Filet for me - and both were done to perfection. Appetizers and sides were very good, and our dessert, ordered to-go, was excellent. The only thing that wasn't up to par were the seasoned french fries. They were just above warm, underdone, and flavorless, but it didn't sink the meal by any stretch. Perhaps just an off batch ?

Best part of the night, though, was our server, Leah. She was wonderful ! Attentive without hovering, quick to respond to a request, smiling and friendly - we'll be sure to ask for her the next time we visit."}
{"text":"We've always loved Longhorn. Couldn't wait for the valley to get Longhorns. It's almost always consistently good food no matter which location. And if this review was just solely on the food, it'd be five stars.

Exactly one week ago, last Saturday night, at this location was the first time ever I'd describe the service at a Longhorn as HORRIBLE. Our waitress was very BLAH, not friendly, and VERY SLOW. We were there for well over an hour for:   chicken firecrackers, ribeye, flat iron steak, fried shrimp, and three sodas. 

Then the server took my credit card and didn't bring it back with the receipt to sign. At least ten minutes later, a different server brought my credit card to me. So, I spent the rest of my evening on the phone with my bank reporting my credit card number stolen.

Great food at most Longhorns, but I'd avoid this location."}
{"text":"I think this is my third time trying this place?  The corn fritter appetizer is very good.  The service was pretty friendly, a little helpful and very efficient.  Everything else is meh.  We were seated in a booth that had the soda dispenser on the other side of the wall.  The sound of it was very annoying while trying to dine.  The bread was the texture of a hockey puck.  Thought it was a fluke and we asked for different bread - same situation.  The rib eye steak is way over seasoned in my opinion.  Got the one on the grill not from pan.  Tried the dessert sampler and was not impressed with a single thing of the three options.  The place is just over priced for what you get.  Texas Roadhouse is much better."}
{"text":"I'm in general not a fan of the American style chain restaurants but we had a gift card that was burning a hole in our pockets so we decided to come here for lunch today. We ordered the chili cheese fries, chicken tender salad and a bacon cheeseburger. Everything was very good and the service was great. The portions on the dinner menu are large and I couldn't finish my salad- it had 6 chicken tenders on it. The burger was tasty and the bacon was crisp. While it may not be my first choice of restaurant it's somewhere I would consider going again, especially when I get a craving for a chicken tender salad."}
{"text":"Had a great server and a great environment but food is just so so. My ribeye steak was super thin. The skinniest steak I have ever seen. I asked for it to be lightly seasoned and it had so much salt it was like I was eating salt straight out of a shaker and no steak. Not worth the money. I will make the trip to Texas Roadhouse or Arrowhead Grill next time."}
{"text":"My lunch with my mom here today was definitely A-OK.  The host that seated us was personable and our waitress was attentive without being aggravating.  We weren't on a time constraint, but we definitely would have been in and out within a lunch hour.  

I ordered just a wedge salad.  The lettuce was fresh, as were the tomatoes, but it was over-dressed and under-baconed.  It was fine.  Mom had the lunch combo with a house salad and a shaved prime rib sandwich.  She said all was good.  

The price for what was had was reasonable.  Good experience.  If in the area again, I would return."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! I ordered salmon with the creamed spinach and sweet potato. My husband got the ribeye. Both meals were exactly how we ordered them and tasted as expected. However, I ordered a Southern Mule and received the wrong drink, it wasn't very good and we didn't see the waitress much. Was a good experience otherwise."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Longhorn locations in my travels, and most have them were decent. I always thought of them as a step up from an Outback. We finally tried this location right near our home, and it will likely be my last trip to Longhorn. Like many others on here have said they WAY over salt their meat. I like salt, but I was choking on the Ribeye I had. I ordered my steak medium rare, and they warned about ordering undercooked meat. I told the waitress I don't mind a little blood. My steak was hardly pink in the center, and past medium, much less medium rare. The grilled corn was burnt, and dried out despite all of the oil they coated with. My wife liked her chicken salad at least, but it didn't look like anything special to me. At the cost of the meal it's not worth the price. 

Adios Longhorn"}
{"text":"My wife Kare & I went to this location again, the last time we had steaks and they were delicious.  Friday night we had their ribs.  The rib plate was huge and we split it and it was still too much for both of us.  The service is 'top notch' and the staff is all friendly and client oriented.  This is our new 'Go To' place for dinner.  Next time we are trying their fish dinners."}
{"text":"I've had better steaks at 3am at a run down diner.  Honestly the worst steak I have ever eaten.  Well, I didn't eat it because it was actually inedible.  I was there this past Saturday and ordered their fire grilled t-bone cooked medium rare.  What came out was nearly unrecognizable.  It was a thin cut of meat and so over cooked it was white throughout.  I have eaten here before and never had an experience like this.  I'll never go back.  I know this isn't Morton's, but for $21.99 I would hope for something a little better."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, and food was fixed in a timely manner.  

Cons: food was over cooked, no silverware was given (to-go order)"}
{"text":"Dinner.
Sat at bar.
Bar tender was friendly and attentive.
Dinner salad, fresh and delicious.
11 ounce steak, cooked perfectly.
Incredible favor. 
Broccoli side cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Honestly I forgot which location I went to on my trip but I do remember the food being delicious!  I ordered the prime rib which was cooked to perfection and the au jus was very tasty. The mashed potatoes were delicious and my Roy Rogers was never empty.  The chips and dip were good and he sampler appetizer were all hits with our table.  My mother had the filet which was cooked perfectly and buttery smooth.  My wife had a Ribeye which was flavored perfectly.  The staff were accommodating and very attentive (granted we came on a weeknight)."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience two days ago our order came out with little wait the server was excellent the food was relishes every think was great"}
{"text":"Love it! Came here on a Friday night for the first time. Had a couple drinks that were very nicely made. Ate the 6oz sirloin . It was delicious! Taylor was our server and she was super nice and friendly. Will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Not good if you like hamburgers.  I had one of the worst hamburgers at a sit down restaurant last Friday night March 11th.   I have no idea how good the steaks are, but avoid the burgers, fries and kettle chips.  Absolutely terrible.  Not a good burger.
As for everything else, I have no idea and never will because I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"SALT

That about describes all the food. My husband and were starving around 10pm after traveling from LA to Chicago, then driving to our hotel in Madison. I was hungrier than he was and felt like steak so we tossed it up between the only two steakhouses still open at this hour that wouldn't cost $200: Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse. 

We had:
- French onion soup
- Buffalo wings
- T-bone with baked sweet potato
- Outlaw (bone-in) ribeye with fries

Our server, Madison, was the only one around for the night and she made sure we had everything we needed for food and drinks. We split the appetizers and honestly, all of the flavors were about as good as we expected, but it was JUST SO SALTY??? My mouth hurt a little bit by the end of the night. The soup was salty and it was made bearable only by the cheese. The wings, already brined and quite salty (the meat was salty with no sauce/seasoning), were fried then dusted with some more salty dry seasoning. These could've been so good if not brined.

The steaks were cooked shockingly well to a nice medium or so. My husband did ask for medium rare on his ribeye though since the steak was so thin, it came out closer to medium. I loved the soft baked sweet potato (no cinnamon sugar!) and butter. It was super rich and really mellowed out the saltiness of the steak. 

Overall it was a better experience than we thought it would be and the price is good for all the food you get."}
{"text":"Excellent Napa grilled chicken and steaks! Staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"The best place I've found in Monroe.  Decent wine, and good food.  If you're gluten free, you should be able to find something edible here."}
{"text":"So I want to take my Dad out for his Birthday and this place had recently opened so he wanted to try it. I called the place around 12:30 on a  Saturday (used the yelp app) and asked if we could have a reservation for eight at 4:30. Was told yes and the woman who answered the phone asked for my name. Good so we are set then. Wrong!

We get there around 4:20 and I let them know I have a reservation and give the hostess my name. She gives me a confused look and says they don't take reservations! Well, who did I speak to four hours earlier?!? She tells me they have to put tables together so we have to wait fifteen minutes. Okay. While waiting there was another party in the same boat, thought they had a reservation but don't. Very organized this place.

We get seated, server comes to take our drink order, all well and good. She comes back and spills water down my wife's back. An accident and she was very apologetic. We give our orders and the food arrives. I had the renegade sirloin medium well with mashed potatoes. The steak was okay, I have had both better and worse at chain steakhouses. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Very buttery but the portion was on the smaller side especially for the price. My Dad got  some sort of chicken meal that I cannot recall and he mentioned it was bland. My Mother liked her baby back ribs. My wife had the crusted Parmesan chicken and found it tasty and juicy.

The manager showed up in the middle do dinner and apologized to my wife for the water spilling. No comped dinner for her or maybe even a desert, nope, sorry for the water spilled down your back at the beginning of dinner, but enjoy! Our server seemed saddled with too many tables and didn't check on out table too often. When she gave us the check, it was for the wrong table and it took awhile to get us the correct check. 

The reservation issue stilled bothered me so as we were leaving, I opened my yelp app and it was still on the longhorn site it was earlier. I called the number and, yep, it was the Longhorn we were just at so I didn't just imagine I had actually made reservations there.

All in all a bad experience. It is located in a neighborhood that has seen much better days and has competition from a Texas Roadhouse just down the street. My family won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the salmon. Great service and decor (western) good food for young and old at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location several times and had great experiences with both the service and food. 

This time however was different. 

Didn't make it to the food pet because the hostess totally turned us off from bothering from waiting. I asked what the wait time was and after being informed I turned to look at the bar area since I know its open seating. It was then she rudely informed me that \"You won't get your food faster at the bar either\"

Not cool Longhorn. 

Ended up walking out and having dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by and decided to go in for a bite.  Had to wait a little bit for a table so went to visit the bar.  Bartender was attentive at first and then disappeared.  Come to find that he was waiting on tables around the bar area... NOT A GOOD IDEA MANAGEMENT!  We almost walked out... A Bar should always be tended to...  People shouldnt have to wait 10 mins just to order a drink.  By the time he returned behind the bar, he poured our drinks and we had to close our bar tab because our table was ready... great that the wait wasnt that long but it was a disappointment that it was a frustrating wait because I couldn't get a friggin drink while I was waiting.  Now on to food...  steakhouse.. ordered steak.  Filet was cooked perfect and was tasty too. $18.99 for 7oz, $21.99 for 9oz, served with a side, salad and unlimited honey wheat rolls. Hubby got Outlaw ribeye $22.49 18oz.  We also tried the Firecracker chicken wraps.  Very yummy...  $8.49 Spicy grilled chicken and cheese wrapped in a crispy flour tortilla, served with a cool Avocado-Lime dipping sauce.  I myself prefer Texas Roadhouse... I think prices are comparable but food and service is just a little bit better at TR than here."}
{"text":"This is location is pretty good if you get there early. Best steak on the menu is the Renegade Sirloin - and it's the most bang for your buck. I've tried all the others, the rest are usually covered in fat, this one is perfect."}
{"text":"Heather and Ace handled our party of 24 expertly.  The food was fabulous.  Have been there 4 or 5 Years  in row and they are always so accommodating."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place, I just find most everything about it as average. The service was excellent and I'd give it 3.5 if I could.

We haf the mussel app. Which had quite a kick and was pretty good. The portion was very large.

My husband had the Tbone, which was pretty well flavored although a bit overcooked. Nothing special about the fries. 

I had the chicken BBC and bacon specialty Sandwich and it was tasty but just not something I couldn't easily do at home. The broccoli was very fresh tasting

It was a good experience. We've had more spectacular experiences at other places in the area."}
{"text":"We arrived about 20 minutes ago. A 20-30 minute wait. 6-7 empty unbussed tables. Not organized service bar people at all. Glass of wine was dirty. We're waiting along with about 8 different groups.
We got seated! Our server Mike was exceptional. Food was delicious. We understand they were understaffed which is a management issue. Mike was professional and friendly. Will come again but management seriously needs to be addressed. The wait staff should have had much better support."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak cooked med and when i got it home it was cooked well done . I ended up feeding it to my dog . To spend $25 on a steak and get it well done is extremely disappointing . I called the manager and he said he would email me a coupon for a free steak . If that happens I will update this review . Overall I am extremely disappointed

They did email me a $25 Gift card . I feel like they did the right thing and I will go back . Thanks Longhorn!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always been pleased. Excellent steak and lobster tail. The wait it usually a lot better than the one at Outback also. It also is less noisy."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  Choosing between Outback and Longhorn in the same area, I'd remembered how good Longhorn was the last time I'd eaten at one a few years back and came here  

Big mistake.  Huge.  

I ordered the Ribeye, while my wife got the Filet.  Hers looked good, but lacked any seasonings and was pretty bland.   Surprising, given Longhorn's reputation.  My Ribeye - ordered medium-rare - was about 60% fat and gristle.  I couldn't even cut into it.   Our server was shocked to see how poor the cut they'd served was, and sent the manager over while having a second steak fired for me.  

When the new one arrived, I found most of it to be fat and gristle again; easily 50% of the steak was inedible.  Also, while I like a good medium-rare or even rare steak, this was ridiculously undercooked.  The manager never came back to check on us, and our server again commented on how bad this new steak looked, and gave us a coupon from another table for $4.00 off our meal for the hassle.  After the discount, our meal (2 adults, one 4 year old child) came to just over $70.   

Outback will be getting our business from now on."}
{"text":"Great service, Mojito on happy hour was amazing, Manager fixed a small issue no questions ask. Steak was exactly as ordered and very good."}
{"text":"First let me say that I love Long Horn in general but I find that this particular location is consistent with their excellent service.  Their staff is the reason why I continue to frequent this location.  The food is great too!"}
{"text":"Always great food  and service, we started with the wild west shrimp and than we ordered the surf & turf cooked perfectly.
and no wait on a Fri night.

Great Meal"}
{"text":"Dont waste your dinner by ordering takeout. The staff is just incompetent. And that might actually be a compliment to say. 
Ordered \"well done\" steak 3 different nights. Every single time it was almost raw. The last time, tonight. It was bloody again and no bread after i specifically asked for bread. Im just not wasting my time with this restaurant. You have to take 2 trips every time just to get your dinner right."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here a few nights ago and I was extremely dissatisfied with my experience. I ordered a filet and when it came out it did not look like a filet to me. It was about 1/2 inch thick, not tender and overcooked. I asked a hostess to bring over our waitress to the table where I proceed to ask her if this was actually a filet. She then said she would bring over the manager because he was more knowlegable about steaks. The manager came over and I explained to him my disatisfication with the steak. He then proceed to talk to me in an condesdencing manner, explaining to me that all steaks are different and that the cooks use weights on the steaks while they are cooking and that's why the steak appears \"squish\". He never apologized and never offered to resolve my problem. After the manager left our waitress then came back over and asked if the problem was resolved. I again explained to her that it wasn't and I was still disatisifed with my meal. She then said she would talk to the manager again and I saw them go into the kitchen and exchange words. The manager never came back out again but the waitress came back to our table and apologized profusely but she couldn't do anything to solve the issue. I left without finishing my food but paid full price for it."}
{"text":"This was a gray, reasonably priced dinner date night. Took my wife here for her birthday after reading the reviews. Contrary to her belief, the meat served here is not Mastro's or even Ruth Chris (my only reason for not providing 5 stars for a restaurant with \"Steakhouse\" in the name), but it is half the price. Our server was EXTREMELY helpful and prompt. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"My coworkers n i used to frequent this restaurant regularly and the service was phenomenal however today it has taken a drastic downhill with what was noticed as a new overhaul of staff a horrendous manager and our waitress page she was slower than molasses even though we had made it clear at the beginning we were on a time crunch it took 15 minutes to get glasses of water it's took over 30 minutes to get our food this place is really gone downhill"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the terrible, horrendous service I had today at this location. I went to dinner with two others, waited over 8 minutes for drinks, waited for another 5 for our waitress to take out order, and after we had eaten waited FIFTEEN minutes to get the boxes and check we had to ask for. Out waitress, Cheyenne, was awful. After forgetting the lemons we asked for three times she finally brought them over and admitted she has a terrible memory. Uh, are you in the wrong industry or what?! She then dropped the food, didn't come by to see how it was (mediocre) and ignored us the whole time. As a waitress I am often hypercritical, however I can objectively say this poor girls needs an easier job! While we were waiting for our check and boxes (that she never offered, and we had to initiate) we did not see her for 15 minutes until finally I had to get up to get a manager, who himself wasn't visiting tables or checking on anyone. I told him we were experiencing bad service and had been waiting for our check, which he quickly printed out. To his defense he did purchase out dessert because I must have clearly looked pissed. We waited again for Cheyenne to pick up out credits card which took forever. We of course tipped her well, all of us being in the service industry, but we would have tripled the amount we left her if she wasn't so aloof and absent!! The absolute worst service I've had in a long time, and could have been better taken care of at Applebee's or Denny's."}
{"text":"Nasty. I'd rather spend a little more for better quality food. This is one step up from Applebee's."}
{"text":"Wait was looooonnnnng, expected on a Saturday. We got lucky, Anthony was our server. Excellent service by Anthony, thank you! Steaks was great and chicken dish was good. I recommend this place. Call for reservations!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of why I don't eat at chains. It was a family members bday choice.... so I tried to make the best of it. Here are the stats, in my standard format:

The good: the aged white cheddar stuffed mushrooms (though probably microwaved) were yummy.

The bad: they were remodeling and the decor was so terrible. plastic table cloths, the tape on the walls and floor. whatever... just seemed like they could have done a better job of not making people feel like they were eating in a construction zone. i also didnt love how no one acknowledged the construction. you dont realize the important those silly little \"pardon our dust\" signs are until they are missing... and the waitress doesn't say \"sorry about the construction\"

The ugly: I stepped on a rib (?) bone and fork on the way to my table. there was crap everywhere on the floor which made it  look like a- surprise- construction zone! Our appetizer plates were all dirty... not a speck of food, but like someone had mashed potatoes on all of them and they might have tried to rinse the plate with a really weak stream of water. and to top it off, the waitress didn't even seem phased by the dirty plate replacement request. just got a simple \"ok\". a lot of food seemed microwaved or just limp and weird looking.
 
Overall it wasnt the worst experience in my life, but certainly not good. i'd go again if i got a gift card for christmas or something... and just eat tons of stuffed mushrooms."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a good mother's day dining experience. For $20, the 12oz NY strip steak, while supposed to be medium cooked and juicy, was very hard around the edge, dry in texture, chewy, and flavorless. I downed it after drizzling it with lots of A1 sauce and left the hard edges behind. They were literally inedible. The table bread was good but the doe towards the middle was kind of raw/unbaked. Calamari also lacked \"actual calamari\", squids and only had empty fried rings. Service was somewhat slow and sporadic, had to ask for refills several times, but that is understood on a busy mother's day weekend. Overall a $100 bill for below average food. I expected more."}
{"text":"ZERO stars would be a more accurate rating of this restaurant. I visited on a Wednesday night...long after the dinner crowd (7:30 ish). There were approximately 7 tables in the entire place and several servers on the floor. It was absolutely THE WORST dining experience I have had in my 48 yrs. It took 15 minutes to get a server to come to our table, and when she did she was annoyed that I had asked another server to find her and that we wanted to place our whole order before she brought our drinks. She forgot to bring out our salads, so after waiting another 20 minutes I had to ask another server for those. Our food, 2 MEDIUM RARE steaks with a side of broccoli, took 45 minutes to come out. We asked to speak to the manager to see why we were having such a disappointing experience when they were clearly not busy and we were told there is just \"a lot of miscommunication tonight\". After we finished our meal, we once again had to hunt down our server to bring the check~ which was completely wrong. We ordered 2 sirloins and were charged for 2 filets~ a difference of $20. The manager responded to this by saying, \"well I saw her deliver your food and they were filets.\" Filets or not (and I am hoping that the steak on my plate was not a $25 steak!) we did NOT order filets!!! Long story short...if you are looking for a steakhouse in this area, look for the nearest Outback!!!"}
{"text":"Long way from home but it's well worth it Moe the waitress was awesome The food was delicious and great and the portion were big I would very highly suggest be hungry when you get here love this place"}
{"text":"I historically never liked Longhorn Steakhouse but since moving to Charlotte there has been a shortage of steakhouses to choose from.  This was the best experience ive ever had at a steakhouse!  Service was great, food was excellent,  and i was very pleasantly surprised!  This is my new favorite place for steaks in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This poor restaurant is not going to last much longer. All the negative reviews are pretty darn accurate!  We've come about 10 times in the past 13 months. They just can't get it right.  If I was the franchise owner, my head would spin and I would fire the managers.  We've decided we are not coming here any longer until I see a sign saying \"under new management.\"   Bye."}
{"text":"Your usual big box steak place.  Nothing fancy, I had your standard ribeye with mushrooms and Bordelaise piled on top.  It was cooked correctly(medium rare) and the sides were fine.(mash potatoes and vegetable)  Service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 
It's been more than a decade since I've eaten at a Longhorn Steakhouse. It'll be another, I'm sure. Traveling through this town with my family, we decided to use a gift card we received a couple years ago. Ordered everything online, so I know most of my issues weren't made by a server. Staying at a hotel 10 minutes away, I had to return for a soup, later learned my caesar steak salad was not caesar, the dressing was terrible tasting, the server that packed our bag turned everything on its side to fit it in the bag, then forgot to give us the three apple juices we ordered with our kids meals, etc. The list just goes on. Now, one or two issues, I would chalk up to simple mistake. However, there was obviously no checks and balances with the way this location operates. Very disappointed. 
On the plus side, all of our food was cold, so my kids didn't have to wait to eat!"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner to go, $42.99 porterhouse steak for two medium rare, steak was burnt and sides of potatoes were drenched with butter! I tried to call to give my experience but the phone rang 10 times no answer! So I will never order again!"}
{"text":"I am usually very generous when writing a review. Today I might be just a little more objective. Darden corporation, you might be putting far to much emphasis on the operational duties of being a hostest at your restaurant. Due to her hair style we will call her Velma, painting a picture yet? Also they don't wear name tags and at no time was I introduced. So I walk in today with my children around 4:00 and \"velma\" makes eye contact with me then turns her back to me because rangling her menues is so much more important than actually welcoming us to Long horn. I'm immediately put off by this and I start wondering if we should walk out. For details explained lated i'm very glad we didn't.  So now \"Velma\" counts us and grabs three menus and as more of a statement than a question says 3? She starts walking because apparently us being there is keeping her from the most important task ever, her menus.  I tell her that we are waiting for the fourth member of our party and this seems to perplex her. Now keep in mind folks that at some point the braintrust at Darden flys their employees to Florida to be certified to meet the grueling requirements of Darden. I'm getting the idea the \"Velma\" might have not passed the menu segment and had to retake that portion because the guest walking in takes a back seat to making sure they are in place. They even have their staff wearing police style communications. I envision at this point a whole code system to ensure the god almighty menues make it back to the podium. So now because we are not offered the choice of waiting until our fourth member arrives we are walking briskly to keep up with \"Velma\" to a table. She gets to the table and makes the question of is this table alright sound far more that a statement. Now I do something that stumps her. I tell her no. The table is the closest to the kitchen they have, hum! My children maybe the reason? The table is also half booth with two chairs and just not what I want when paying for dinner. So now \"Velma\" being even more stumped walks back to the podium, her barrier to the general public. \"Velma\" now hands me a pager and misses my joke completely as I tell me children that now we are known as 43. Humor is completely lost on \"Velma\" as at this point I am keeping her away from her precious menus.  By now my wife arrives, formerly known as my fourth.  This point \"Velma\" might seem just a little happy because she is clutching her menus.  Now at this point you may think I need to get a life and might also be wondering why a 3 start review. Once seated we met Haili. I know her name because she cheerfully introduced herself and welcomed us to Longhorn. Wow she gets it. As obnoxious as I may be she usderstands that menus really don't  create revenue but guest do. We looked over our menues and order and have a really nice dinner. Haily has the Darden indoctrination and says my pleasure to just about anything you ask and even acknowledges that when I ask if thats a Darden thing. Turns out she moved to Az from New York with the company to open new locations. This is a very good choice as she does a great job of chipping away any damage done by hostest \"Velma\" we have a nice cross section of menu items and a nice strawberry shortcake to share. During no point of our meal were our tea glasses empty because Haily is on it. We pay, we grab our takeout box and walk towards the hostest podium. Now I can't help but walk real slow just to offer the opportunity of maybe a thanks for coming perhaps just kiss my ass but nope nothing. \"Velma\" is now teaching we will call him Erchal how to make sure the menus are in order. I say thank you for choosing Longhorn but this just satisfies my humor as it is lost on \"Velma\". Way to busy training \"Erchal\" the importance of the menu's.  Food overall was good. Porterhouse never disapoints. HAILY  is awesome! Need I say more about \"Velma\"? No! A perfect solution here would be a field trip acoss the street to the olive garden. Why you ask? If you have ever been to the Surprise location of the Olive garden then you know Lynn runs that place to perfection! Darden are you listening or bigger question, do you care?"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and service.  The steak and seafood was as good as much more expensive restaurants. I had a 8 oz. filet that was as tender and tasty as I have had and the meal includes, salad (large), bread and a side.  Great meal and value all around."}
{"text":"Let me state upfront that I rarely do steakhouses, especially chain steakhouses; however, due to a $30 gift card and a steak loving 19-year-old daughter, I opted to make an exception for our Friday lunch date. Boy am I glad I did, as the two sirloin steaks that we ordered where the most tender, leanest sirloins I've ever eaten. I should also add that, as a former butcher, I am very finicky when it comes to beef.

My daughter went with a 6 oz with a side of mac and cheese, which was excellent in itself. It ran about $10.99. I chose the 8 oz with a side of broccoli (perfectly steamed) for $13.99. The steaks were expertly seasoned and accurately cooked. A mini-loaf was also served with butter. Service was friendly and casual but not real attentive, in fact, I ordered a fountain drink that I never received.
The dining room had a great atmosphere with  comfortable booths and the sanitation grade was a 97.

At around 35 bucks with tip, it was definitely an expensive splurge, but the lean steaks and  happy daughter, made it all worthwhile. I'm shocked, but the 4 stars for this trip are legit."}
{"text":"\"There's no way you can get a steak this good, this cheap.\"

I am a business traveler and eat at so called 5 star restaurants on a regular basis.  I can't say I have a particularly sophisticated palette, I am kind of a simple guy.  Give me a good cut of meat, cook it properly to order and bring it to the table hot.  In addition to doing this, we were served by a young woman named Brittany, who was wonderfully pleasant, attentive, and well informed about the menu.  How could I ask for more?  Everyone in my party was delighted with the meal, the restaurant and the service!"}
{"text":"Not a big steak eater but my husband and my mom loves it. So when it's a toss between Ruth Chris and Longhorns, Longhorns seems to always win. The Longhorns in Chandler, AZ has this manager that makes you feel like you are in a down home setting as if he is about to sing you a little diddy. His accent is captivating. You could just listen to him speak. He was awesome with his professionalism and managerial skill. Kevin, at the location on Ray Rd. In Chandler, Az should really be acknowledged. He make people want to come back."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night. Wait time about 1 hr. Had two glasses of wine. Food finally came. BBQ rib was cold and rubbery. It was like they slapped on cold BBQ sauce on a piece of rib that wasn't even cooked out the plastic bag. Complaint to the manager on duty that night. And told him we will never be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I went here for dinner with my husband. It was really crowded and the wait was long, but it was worth it. The steak was so juicy and delicious! The portions were great and the bbq sauce is amazing! The staff was really friendly, and for being as busy as they were, they did a great job filling our water and checking on us. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. The wait was kind of long, but well worth the wait. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If I could leave negative stars I would.  Longhorn has zero customer service.  I called to see if I could make a reservation for a party of 17 for my husband's birthday.  I was told that they do not make reservations but I could call ahead a hour before and then wait for an unspecified amount of time with my party.  Yeah, that sounds like an amazing dining experience.  For smaller parties, I totally get it.  They can shift people in and out fairly quickly.  But for 17, you would think they could accommodate the request.  I told the manager I didn't really want to wait for an uncertain amount of time with 17 people and asked if there was anything else she could do.  She said no that's the way it is and Darden doesn't allow for reservations.  Um, someone's pants are on fire on that one.  We have made reservations more than once for large parties for Olive Garden (a Darden restaurant).  She told me I could come down an hour before myself and wait (still no guarantee we would get a table when the rest of the party showed up), but this is not the experience I was hoping for for my husband's birthday.  I would also think the restaurant would prefer to know when large parties are coming to adequately resource and prepare.  But that just might be too sophisticated of an approach.  Well Longhorn, I have made a reservation for my party elsewhere so that my family can focus on the celebration and not the restaurant's total lack of customer service.  At 17 people, you guys passed up on a pretty big tab between cocktails, appetizers, and main courses.  You may not care and say you will make that up anyway on a Saturday night, but from the majority of the reviews I am seeing on Yelp, that might not be the case if you keep up the poor service.  I have recommended your restaurant in the past, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Long Horn is wonderful.  Steak cooked to perfection and the best Pina colada around town!!   Marcus is the best waiter.  Always ask for him he is very nice and professional!!!!  Thanks Marcus for a wonderful dinner"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went out to dinner and we were in the mood for steak!  We decided to pick LongHorn.  After a 45 minute wait we were anticipating  great food and service but we were disappointed.  The service was not great - with waiter forgetting the honey bread they serve, ended up getting it at the end of our meal.  He was not prompt on refills and he got one of our orders wrong.  The food was okay, nothing great or wow about it and that includes the steaks.  I think the best tasting thing of the night was the appetizer, which was their Sampler dish.
Next time we will definitely make a better choice when choosing a steakhouse that will be worth the price!"}
{"text":"As both a quasi-foodsnob and prior butcher, I'm shocked at what I'm about to do: Give  LongHorn Steakhouse, a chain, five stars! There's no way that I cannot, as from the friendly hostess who warmly greeted us while ensuring that we were happy with our table, to Denise, our wonderfully attentive server, to the most tender, delicious sirloin I've ever had, everything was pretty perfect. 

My wife and I both went with the 8 oz sirloins and loaded baked potato for $14.29. We added side salad for $2.99. Again the steaks were perfectly prepared, seasoned and presented as were the loaded baked potatoes. But it didn't stop there, the salads were ice cold, fresh and had what I swore to be house-made croutons as they were melt-in-your-mouth buttery. Even the dressings themselves were exceptional.

Service was also impeccable. Denise continually doted upon us and her other five or so tables. The other wait staff seemed to be no less conscientious with their customers. Fresh drinks were delivered well in advance. The manager himself checked on us and all those sitting in our area. Sanitary rating was 96.5 and everything looked immaculate. The dining room itself is very attractive and comfortable.

Even on the way out, a busboy turned around and thanked us for coming. All in all, this is a well-run restaurant that that delivers on all counts. I got to give it five stars and can't help but to recommend it fully."}
{"text":"First, it was a Sunday night, we had to wait 25 min. We sat at the bar had a couple drinks bartender was super nice. Then we sat down at our table and our server was a lot of fun with a great attitude. For appetizer we the shrimp one we liked very much. For entree, I had filet mignon and my husband the outlaw ribeye. The ribeye was order medium and they gave it to me medium well. I let the sever know and he fixed the problem right and in 5 minutes I had my steak the correct way. We didn't do desserts this time though we looked at the menu and hey liked good. Maybe next time! Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night for mothers day and we enjoyed the prime rib dinner. It was delicious and came with just the right amount of seasoning. The mash potatoes were creamy, the loaded baked potatoe was just the right size. We also enjoyed the strawberry walnut salad it was definitely delicious and is a must try when you visit.  We had unlimited warm bread while waiting for our meal. Our server appeared to be new and just learning the ropes but he was very nice and friendly. He interacted with my son and overall made sure we had everything we needed. Our dessert arrived and the portion was big enough for 2-3 people to share. We will definitely be back when we want to enjoy a nice, quiet and delicious meal. Prices are just right and portions are big enough to share saving you money."}
{"text":"As chains go Longhorn always stands out! This location has never disappointed me and I've been dining here over 10 years.  The food is consistently good and so is the service. The chain is always coming out with new menu items and the food is always fresh. You can't compare it to fine dining, but dining here won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have dined at every location of this chain in my local area, and this is THE BEST location, hands down!

This is a go-to choice for going out with friends.  The steaks are almost always perfect, and if they're not exactly what was expected, the staff jumps into over-drive to make it right and all without any attitude!  This location is also a training ground for new managers, so there's always extra help on hand.

The food is great, and I have rarely had better service.  When in the mood for a decent steak at a good price, this is my first choice.  Can I get a little better by going fancy?  Yes, of course.  But I don't always want to get fancy and pay twice as much, lol.  This Longhorn is great!  I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"We try eating here about once a month. It's nice and quiet for our taste. There is a bar area with big screen TVs. Sometimes there's a long wait but it's worth it. The only problem I have is that the menu changes frequently. So it's hard to get attached to certain items. We personally like the chili calamari and fried green tomatoes and key lime pie. But again, their seasonal."}
{"text":"Manager named \"L\" Sanford is great.  While eating at Longhorn in Argyle, I watched him as a manager.  The atmosphere was pleasant because he was a team player.  He did not stand around and was there any time he could help anyone.  \"L\"  came around to different tables to ask customers if everything was alright or if they needed anything, he was personable yet business, meals were great, service was wonderful and smiles were seen on the staff.  Staff looked like they enjoyed their job and manager.  Having a great manager like \"L\"  showed among them.  My son and I had a great time and will be back again soon.

On the other hand went to Longhorn on Roosevelt and will not be back.  The atmosphere and service was poor.  There was a bartender that was sweet, kind and would see we were distressed so she asked if we needed anything.  We said yes, we needed refills, bartender got them for us, even though we asked our waitress 2 different times for a refill.  Felt like waitress was avoiding us.
Food there was not as great as in Argyle."}
{"text":"Worst service in the history of restaurants . Always understaffed and never eat here at busy times if service is important to you"}
{"text":"Went to LongHorn for date night with my husband tonight. It was crowded as usual but we didn't mind waiting at the bar. We always love their steaks. We really liked our server. I wish I had gotten her name.  she was excellent! Very attentive and we were well taken care of. When our steaks came out I was disappointed my steak was well done instead of med rare the way I like it. I usually do not complain but with cost of eating out anymore I mentioned to the person who delivered our meal that I wasn't happy. She in turn told our server and they took care of it immediately. The chef even came out to apologize. I was wowed!! She then took the steak off the bill and gave me a free dessert! That's what I call exceptional service. I will tell everyone I know and will stay loyal to our LongHorn. Mistakes happen, especially in a busy kitchen but it is what you do to correct them makes all the difference!"}
{"text":"Lobster Tails? Amazing. Baked potato? Fluffy. My steak? Burnt. I didn't know well done meant \"burn the edges\". My tables waiter was outstanding and very patient overall. I give the restaurant 3 stars simply because my steak was burnt. It was my first time going to a LongHorn, it could've been better."}
{"text":"Went to this fine restaurant for the first time last night, (Friday March 24th). GREAT EXPERIENCE! A great handsome waiter that looked just like Michael Douglas came out, what a way to start! I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye, it couldn't have been more delicious. Salad was fabulous too along with the bread. Yum, yum! Look forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We only had a party of 10 and they gave us two waiters which I thought would be great. They started out with messing up our drink orders and then as they were bringing the salads out they forgot one salad. When we asked for our missing salad they said they wouldn't serve our dinner until I was finished with the salad. I told him that was not necessary but they waited anyway. So once we got our food of course they came out cold. And then they proceeded to mess up our drink order again. Service was very very slow"}
{"text":"Love this place! Steak was phenomenal!! Service was just ok but it's worth it for the food!!"}
{"text":"I placed my order online at approximately 1:05pm for pick-up at 1:40 pm. Reason being I had a 2:30pm business meeting and that would give me enough time to eat and head to my meeting. I arrived at 1:40pm and was told the online system was not working so the kitchen never received my order and it would be another 10 mins (1:50 ish). Not even 5 mins after, a young lady came to pick up her online order and it was immediately handed to her to go order. At this point, I was confused.that means, she would have ordered at or around the same time I ordered. Even more frustrating was my order did not come up until 2:10. I literally had to rush to get to my important meeting and was wondering why there was no discount or mention of discount for the lack of performance by the staff at long horn mallard creek?"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there on Friday night. We were told a 20 minute wait for a table on a friday night, which is acceptable for a weekend and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Sweet...
We had the calimari as an app. So tasty! And huge! Lots of apps to nibble on. For entrees we got steaks and salads. I got the 16 oz ribeye, cooked to med rare perfection. 
My wife had the sirloin, medium, but it came out well done. No big deal, we still ate it up.
Our server was Megan. She was fast, efficient and personable. We never had to ask for drink refills or bread refills 
Had a great meal! Will go back again."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars and the reasons are the waiter and bar staff. 

The waiter was nice and did get us what we wanted when we asked, but challenged my fiancé about his order. My fiancé asked for mushrooms and onions on his steak and when the order came out, he only brought mushrooms. When my fiancé asked for onions (again) the waiter said \"is that was you told me before?\" I just feel that the waiter should have said \"let me get that for you right away\" whether he asked for it or not, he requested it now. I think that service could have been better. 

Also, the bartender was a bit pushy with the way he was trying to up-sell the products. I ordered a glass of Pinot noir and he recommended the more expensive brand, even though I did not ask for that one (la crema). I ended up getting the la crema Pinot noir, per his recommendation, and then he tried to get me to buy a 9oz glass over the 6oz! I feel that he was trying to make me buy more and more and it became annoying. 

There were also a lot of positives and I do love the food at Longhorn. My fiancé also ordered the captains mule drink and it was amazing!  Very refreshing. Food was flavorful, came out quick, and it was all tasty."}
{"text":"We generally come to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area once a year, and the past two visits, we've stopped at LongHorn to grab some dinner to go. Both times, we've been extremely impressed with both the service and the food. The last time we came to Phoenix, I ordered the Renegade Sirloin (rare) and Redrock Grilled Shrimp with a side of green beans and rice pilaf. The shrimp were fresh, cleaned well, succulent, and cooked to perfection. The steak was prepared just to my liking and seasoned nicely. The sides were great as well. This past time, I wanted something a little lighter than steak, so I opted for the Redrock Shrimp alone, with the rice pilaf and green beans. The dinner again did not disappoint. The pilaf was flavorful and the green beans had just the right amount of crunch. I also ordered the Jack&Honey Lemonade, and oh my goodness. It is one of my new favorite cocktails. The blackberries and honey together make the most heavenly drink. Everything is affordably priced to boot. As I said, the service was also fantastic. This last time we went, we sat in the bar area (we came close to closing time... we like to eat late!). The bartender was sweet  and attentive. When she brought out our to-go order, she went through and showed us everything just to make sure she had everything we asked for. Yes, this place is a chain. But they're obviously doing something right. Next time we're back in Phoenix, we'll be back to LongHorn for another yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant always great service & food, employees are attentive  I wish the hamburger was Angus or Kobe,  the salads are large & tasty, plenty of parking, usual wait times are under 30 minutes prices are in line with compared steak houses"}
{"text":"Terrible service, our drinks we constantly empty, my steak charred and over done, dads salmon came 15 minutes after our steaks. All we got was a \"im sorry\" and manger didn't offer anything to us or to comp the bill. Will never go back again. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Had a gift card for Longhorn Steakhouse and was seated promptly but then sat there waiting for a server for close to 25 minutes without anyone even acknowledging me so of course that was enough with servers constantly walking by my booth without a word. The place wasn't even that busy in my opinion. Went up and complained to the manager and demanded a refund on the gift card. He handled it well and refunded my 40 bucks and gave me 40 bucks in additional gift cards so that soothed my anger. Went on reviews and it seems that kind of thing is happening alot there and it's a newer place and pricey to boot. Now here I sit at Outback cause now I want a damn steak!! I would have given it one star but the manager handled the situation well but they need to get better help in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good ambiance and presentation with great service but unfortunately, quality of the the food has gone downhill from  what it used to be.

In years past, we have dined here many times and it was always a good dining experience considering it's a chain.  Walked in today just after 11am after we got out from Church and were prompty seated and our server was there immediately  Beverage orders were taken immediately and warm bread presented at the table.  Placed our orders which in my case was the two pork chops, french fries and a side salad. My wife ordered a cup of the Soup of the day along with a Black and Blue Steak Salad.

So far so good till things began to arrive. My wife's order came out OK but in my case, the balance of oil vs vinegar in the salad dressing was off resulting in an overly tart salad, the pork chops while decent cuts of meat, were overcooked, dry and tough and the french fries were raw in the middle or in otherwords, inedible.

The Sweet Tea was so sweet that subsequent glasses had to be dliuted with unsweeten tea just to get a proper balance.

Menu has been revamped with some new items offered but overall cost of individual entrees has gone up.  It would be justified if the quality was there but unfortunately not the case so it's a poor value"}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience  at longhorn tonight.  First off ,I'm in a wheel chair & had no help getting in the dooir. We were seated & ordered our food. The server was not personable in the least. We had to ask for refills & everything else we needed . The steak was cold when brought to the table . When we notified the server she acted like it was an imposition to tell her. did not say she was sorry, just took the steak in the back room and when all about her business. a gentleman that was dressed rather nice brought the steak back out firmly set it on the table and said here. still was not hot but kind of like a lukewarm like the food you get to McDonalds. the steak had absolutely no flavor. When we went to leave the restaurant there were no apologies for the terrible service or the food being cold or absolutely nothing. there were two servers at the front desk when I was ready to leave and neither one of them offered to open the door so I can get the wheelchair through. service like this they will not be in business long."}
{"text":"The waitstaff was attentive the manager friendly and accommodating. My wife's steak was just right her Margarita was too her liking. Mother-in-law loved her Salmon and the bread. My corn on the cob was good so too the broccoli. The prime rib was not pleasant the staff made it right for me. Thank you to the crew and staff."}
{"text":"A typical chain but good steak anyway.  This is part of that shopping trip that can be enjoyed.   the good part is a nice ribeye steak.  But Tonite it was about the Apple harvest salad,  spinach, cranberrys, pecans, sweet potato chips, and Apple cider vingerate.  This was probably best green thing ever on their menu.   

The steak was a nice medium rare.  More toppings than tater! If you throw in the $10 coupon with $50gift card you get a good deal with meal. 

The best appetizer was the Montana mule. Served in a insulated mug,  a nice mix of bourbon, pureed ginger, and lime juice.  I had to get a second one to make sure it was a really good drink."}
{"text":"Much better service and spot on food.   This is perfect chain experience.   Everything was very good.   The service was great as I showed up in crutches and they opened the door fit me. We had drinks in five minutes. Alyssa, or server, even explained specials.   

Seriously the food was very good, rare and med rare ready were that.   The drinks had decent amount of alcohol too.   The might started at an outback in parma but they would not wait on us, so twenty minutes later we left."}
{"text":"My son and I dined here recently.  He's a steak fan and I was looking for something he would eat!  My son ordered a Rib eye (standard) and I ordered the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken w/ a sweet potato and veggies.
Our meal was prepared well and it didn't take very long.  My son's steak was cooked properly and since he \"woofed\" it down, I suppose it was pretty good!
My Parmesan chicken was excellent.  There were two pieces on the plate so I was quite satisfied with the serving size.  The sweet potato was average in size and properly cooked (baked); not burnt.  I always look for the fresh veggie sides these days and Longhorn didn't disappoint.  Very tasty!
We were very pleased with the service!  Our waitress kept our beverages filled and was most attentive!"}
{"text":"While the hostess was very nice, we were told the wait was going to be about 20-25 minutes.    Several people came in after us and were seated before us.  We asked if they called ahead, and they had not.  After speaking to someone for the second time, we were finally seated after 55 minutes of waiting.  Our waitress was not very friendly, either.  The only good thing about the place was the food, but it was not good enough to make up for the ridiculous wait time, being seated after parties that arrived after us, and being treated with sub-par service.  Maybe I'll change my review if they can improve their service, but until then, this is what you guys deserve.

Correction: Our waitress got progressively better throughout the experience.  I will add a star just because of that."}
{"text":"The general manager, Chris Hefner, reached out to me after the Darden Restaurants social media contact made him aware of my review and experience at his restaurant.  I received a personal call and an apology.  On top of that Chris invited me to give the restaurant a second try, compliments of him.

I decided that after writing such a harsh, but accurate, review I should give Longhorn Steakhouse another try.  I went there and it was night and day.

I ordered the same steak again: the Outlaw Ribeye.  This time I was more conservative and went medium rare instead of rare - I love rare steak but un-melted beef fat coats the mouth and isn't toothsome.   It was delicious.  Marbling was great, there was almost no connective tissue, and what little there was happened to be so slight you could eat it without considerable trouble.  The bone was much smaller - and there were very few chunks of fat (as opposed to marbled) on this steak.  I took pictures!

My wife ordered the ribeye.  She thought it was fine but a bit thin, one bite of my Outlaw Ribeye and she was jealous.  After I initially wrote this review I called the manager and he said you can request a thicker steak and you will be accommodated.  For $5 more I can't recommend you go directly to the Outlaw Ribeye - it is thicker and bigger, even though there is a bone there is 18oz vs 11oz.  I have a picture with a fork in front of each of the steaks to try and give you perspective on the relative thickness.

There are some cons to the evening: our appetizer (shrimp and lobster dip) arrived before out complimentary bread (the bread arrived with our entrees).  We were half-done eating it when our salads arrived.  We had just gotten to our salads after finishing off the appetizer (ran out of chips before dip) when our steaks arrived.  I like fast service but our courses came out too close together, but not so close together as to have all three courses out at once.

I ordered the mashed potatoes and asked if I could get those loaded.  I received the standard mashed potatoes, when I got the attention of our waitress she quickly brought out more mashed potatoes on a separate plate and these were loaded.  There is no additional charge to get your mashed potatoes loaded, and we were allowed to keep both sets of mashed potatoes.  Ordering the potatoes this way was the recommendation of our waitress: I always like it when waitstaff know the food on the menu from experience.

These were only minor inconveniences.  The Outlaw Ribeye shined so bright because of its excellent taste and preparation that overall we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Four of us celebrated a birthday today at the LongHorn.  All four orders arrived timely, were hot and really tasty.  The booths had ample room for four to sit.  The waitress served us with a smile.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was very good as usual but we had a 50 minute wait for our food. That is 50 minutes from the time we got our salads! I wasn't even hungry anymore by the time the food got here because I kept eating the bread. Not happy!"}
{"text":"Food is typical longhorn food. So it was good and so was the service. But I can't seem to pin down the smell of this entire restaurant. It's either someone shit on the floor or someone has terrible breath."}
{"text":"Our experience was ok. Overall the young lady taking care of us was nice. The wait on the food was ridiculously long and the place wasn't even crowded."}
{"text":"My Salmon was not cooked how I asked but it was OK, I have had better from here. We also had the cheddar mushrooms for a app, they was pretty good. My husband Outlaw Ribeye said his ribeye was EXCELLENT! Said it was juicy, cooked how he asked and seasoned PERFECT 

They were super so the wait was about 30 mins. We ended up eating in the bar area. There was a LOT of regulars setting in the bar area which was pretty cool.  Customer service was great GREAT WAITRESS!!"}
{"text":"What great steaks and what great service.

Try the ribeye steak with the salt encrusted seasoning.

Also try the chicken wings they are baked and really good."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and family there for my daughter's birthday the sweet potatoes were cold I could stick my finger in it they brought us to new sweet potatoes and those are cold as well my meat was the wrong me so they took that back and I still don't think I got the right to take it look like the same steak with some mushrooms thrown on it was supposed to be a flaming yon and my husband's meat was cold it was a terrible experience the people that serve the food served the food out Us did not give it to me gently and handed it was over the top of the table I was very unhappy I'll never eat there again and I waited 2 years to eat there never again"}
{"text":"Good value for the price! Never a steak fan, so ordered salad and dessert only. LOVE their sweet potato and steamed asparagus sides! Will visit again for price and the sweet potato side!"}
{"text":"Outlaw ribeye was great. It wasn't crowded on a Friday night which was very surprising. I was very disappointed that the homemade steak sauce was not on the menu any longer.
The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The spicy calamari was good but not really spicy we should just had a little bit more kick to it..
The mashed potatoes wasn't my favorite this time very watery and not seasoned."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get a consistently great flavored steak or salmon. That's what makes Longhorn a favorite in my opinion. I've tried other menu items like the 7 peppercorn steak salad which is one of the best steak salads in the area. 
If I would suggest any changes to the menu it would be to offer more vegetables other than broccoli (which is cooked beautifully) and asparagus which is an upgrade for more money. I think if they added roasted vegetables or other greens that would be perfect, but if you like carbs, i.e., they have lots of potatoes! 
One more thing, if you're expecting a thick steak like what you see in glass cases at the grocery store then you're not going to get it here. The steaks are thinner but they are very flavorful, tender and seasoned well, you will not be disappointed!  to Longhorn steakhouse for its consistency and service."}
{"text":"Nice service and I love that we got a booth in the corner for some alone time.  Nice meal, food cooked to order and taste.  Reminds me of Tahoe Joe's."}
{"text":"Was just at longhorn for a birthday/ anniversary meal with my husband and mom. It was a pretty quiet night and we got a server we have had at Friday's before (Hi name is Hunter). To start with my husband got a New york strip steak, my mom got sirloin, and I got the prime rib... Everything to start with was cooked perfectly, seasoned very well, and was amazing tender all of this alone got it 5 stars because of how good it Tasted BUT HUNTER the amazing waiter who we have had a few times before at other restaurants is pretty much the reason we will be going back he gets a 5 just on his own due to the fact he is just a purely amazing waiter. If you got and get Hunter expect excellent service period from him. My husband got a drink it was the Captains Mule it was Soo good worth it very worth it. So right now current standing 10/5 thanks to Hunter!"}
{"text":"we knew this place was going to suck, but they managed to meet and exceed our expectations with ease, by far, the Worst/slowest service EVER!!!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant it is pretty good.
Our waiter was very good and attentive. I would highly recommend the porter house for 2 if you are getting steak. 
Good price, good food. Will come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse to go to in Rocky River, it is only saved for special occasions because it is a little more expensive then a steak burger. 
We always get the porterhouse for 2 and are never disappointed. Our wait staff is always prompt. There are times I have to wait 30 min or so, but I don't mind, I just eat 20 mints that are at the door. 
Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good cheeseburger served quickly at the bar.  Like the peanuts in shells to snack on.  Reminds me of Ground Round.  Will have to stop for a steak some time.  Big burger, took half home for later.  Steak fries are a great side.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal with regards to both the service and the steaks.  5 of the 7 steaks ordered were served at one time and were nicely prepared.  The remainder of our family had to wait for several minutes before their steaks came and then one was cooked to near jerky.  She'd ordered medium!  The server never should've delivered the meal to the table.  When the replacement steak arrived, most of our party were nearly done with their meal.  Then the bill came and they had charged for the replacement steak!!  Unbelievable.  They should've comp'd her meal simply due to the inconvenience. Sad reflection on customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Fiesta Bowl on way back to Vegas and it was an awesome steak. Had a nice rub that was spicy. Added grilled onions and mushrooms and it was perfectly cooked! Would go back again."}
{"text":"When I want a steak, Longhorn is top on the list of restaurants to go to. My most recent visit with my wife made me finally write a review. She had a super tender and tasty short rib and I had a perfectly cooked and seasoned parmesan crusted filet. The service was excellent (Tracy) and made for a great experience."}
{"text":"The service at the Longhorn restaurant was good. The server was nice and kept our drinks full. The food was delicious, but the portions are tiny compared to the price you pay for it."}
{"text":"If muscles don't open after you cook then you toss them. If you serve muscles with 6 still closed that means your muscles aren't fresh. If you serve me a second time after I tell you I don't want a new order and 6 more are closed they most definitely arent fresh. No, you can not shuck those muscles and eat them. Because apparently that's what your cooks believe I should have done. I appreciate having the muscles taken off my bill after the second bad attempt but I really think the management and back of house staff should be better educated on something new on the menu, especially when it's seafood, something that is way more prone to get you sick. There was also a hair in my food. After the muscles thing I didn't want to say anything, but that was very bothersome as well. I used to go to longhorn when I was younger all the time. This was my first time there in years, even after my parents told me not to go because all of they're most previous experiences were horrible. Maybe I should have listened."}
{"text":"We were sat very quickly. The dining area was clean with low music playing in the background. I wish I could remember our servers name (she had a thick long black braid) she was awesome. We started worth the calamari appetizer which was AMAZING hands down the best calamari I have had in a long time. The presentation was beautiful like a long boat of calamari. Soft inside surrounded by a crispy fried Batter with honey glaze (I STRONGLY RECOMMEND). I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye medium rare and it was cooked/seasoned perfectly. This steak was way better than the one I had at Texas Roadhouse (I am not affiliated with either place). There was minimal fat but so much flavor. I had a side salad and asparagus which were also very yummy. I had a kong pour of mascato which tasted refreshing and crisp. This is hands down my favorite steakhouse. And I recommend ordering what I did."}
{"text":"Always stop while at UPMC which is close by.  Today had Prime Rib Sandwich and bowl of Potato Soup. Extremely Goood. Wife had Chicken Salad. Many large tender chicken strips. Large enough for two people. Excellent lunch at reasonable price. Gave me my milk in Frosted Mug. Great.  Not 5 star because Amy forgot wife's ice tea and we ordered onion nuggets for appetizer and forgot. We were full enough we didn't need-so she saved us some money. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place.  Food is delicious.  You have to ask for Elizabeth (our waitress.  She is the best! Not everywhere we go we find such a great person that enjoys what she does."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sore this morning, from kicking myself last night for ever letting myself get hornswoggled into going to this Longhorn.  Here's how it played out:

It was the Birthday-Eve kickoff dinner for Birthday Weekend for my wife; my daughter knew that our last visit to a Longhorn pleased the Birthday Girl so wanted to go there, again.  I really considered pulling rank and driving, instead, to Clearview, where the meal, service and evening are guaranteed to be a success.

Went a bit early, as we still had an entire weekend of festivities ahead and needed to pace ourselves.  Still, at five-thirty the place was nearly full, and the service was already in the weeds.  You can just tell when you walk in if there's an issue \"on the floor,\" by the nervous eyes of the hostess, the sudden, jerky moves of the wait staff, and the overall pall of desperation on the diners' faces.  Uh-oh.

The gals both had versions of salmon, but I felt as long as the place has \"steak\" in their name perhaps I should give steak a shot.  My last two Longhorn visits, once here, once at one up north, the steaks were pretty good.  So, a smaller cut of prime rib, medium rare.  (They spell out on the menu their definitions of done-ness, and medium rare is the only way I've ever seen prime rib.  Does anyone say, \"Oh, make sure it is black, no pink at all?\")

Mine arrived, and it was done just as the menu described:  \"Warm, but pink.\"  Uh.  No steak knife?  The staff were doing that Ms. Pac Man stutter-step, trying to get the wheels back under the train.  So, while waiting five minutes for a steak knife, I gamely tried cutting with my bread knife.  That wasn't gonna happen.

Nor was it gonna happen with a sharper instrument.  I tried to cut it, I tried to eat it, I considered asking for a doggy bag, but I love Roscoe too much to subject him to TMJ.  It was, in all my born days, the worst cut of meat I've ever had on a plate.  (Because of the daughter's earnest attempt to make this a special night, I quietly chose a few tumblers of Glenfiddich in lieu of actually eating a meal.)

Horrible.  Hundred bucks, poured down a rat hole.  There really was no excuse for that meat to make it from the kitchen to my plate.  None.  Stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Now, just wait a minute, Tex.  I had NO idea this place was so good.  Brand my ass with a \"B\" and call me Buford, I just LOVES this joint.

Easter, just before high noon.  After our hike, we wander around, thinking about having some ice cream, but you know.  I'm really thinking about something more substantial.  We were actually looking for a different place, but when we saw Longhorn, never having been to one, we took a shot.

Great people.  The chef came out, twice, to talk with us.  FOUR people checked in with us, but never obtrusively.   The waiter did rattle off the prepared speech when he found out we were Longhorn virgins, but it was handled professionally.  (No hugs, no high-fives, no tongues.)  The Child Who Walks As A Goddess ordered an obscenely large dessert, and when we commented on the massive size, not complaining mind you, they comped it.  First time there, they wanted to keep our business.  That's very good management.  (And she'll be eating if for dessert for several more days, thankyouverymudge.)

Okay, the food:  I just had to get a steak, just a little one, nicely seasoned, very much to my order of done-ness, with a sweet potato topped with butter and cinnamon.   Just perfect.  The ladies had a salad and a kid's meal, both just right.  The Salad Lady is oh-so fussy about her greens, and she raved.  

Ignore that this is a chain, and that it is in mega-mall land.  I recommend this one very highly.  (Were I still able to sit at a bar and drink while watching some mind-numbing sport on TEEvee, I would land here.  What a great place.)"}
{"text":"Good was fine. Steak was cook correctly. Service is why only 2 stars. Waiter was in experienced at best, checked on table frequently but did not notice drink order never showed. He told us he put the order in and didn't go to bar to check. The food order came out incomplete and then incorrectly. Nice guy jut inexperienced I hope"}
{"text":"Longhorn was my choice because I was flying solo, it was close and I was pretty sure they would have the Stanley Cup Final on at the bar.  Let me preface this by saying I'm a Bruins fan, they are currently winning game 6 so I feel good.  Back to the review, check on the game; one star.  Any restaurant choice and subsequent review should balance expectation with performance...you don't go to Longhorn expecting Morton's. That said, they had maybe 10 wines to choose from, which exceeded my expectation, so another star.  I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye, bone in and medium rare.  It could have used another minute on the grill, but it was seasoned well and tasted great.  Bone-in was a pleasant surprise, plus it was cooked and seasoned well...star plus a half for the bone.  By the way, asparagus was good, but I was missing the advertised lemon flavor.  A lemon wedge provided quickly by the bartender remedied the situation.  Service...I was at the bar and service was great.  Rich was tending bar, he did a great job.  Last star.  Well, in the time I wrote this the Bruins gave up 2 goals in 17 seconds win a minute left to lose the Stanley Cup.  I'm downtrodden and therefore rounding down...

Don't let a NHL game skew your read of this review.  Longhorn delivered on my expectation.  A GOOD steak, cooked correctly, with attentive service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Longhorn and I was pleasantly surprised!   I was seated quickly and the service was friendly.   The salad was fresh and chilled and the prim rib was tender.   Worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Salmon excellent ,  Mac and cheese wonderful   Steak outstanding. Broccoli great. Service perfect.  Clean restaurant. 
I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Should have known better when we walked in and the \"hostess\" gave us attitude right off the bat without greeting us. Then when there were tables all over we were told we had to wait. Waited 10 minutes then had to go get her and say why arent we being seated, and she just goes, \"oh\" . Waitress was even worse. Attitude, rolling eyes, took 15 min to get bread to the table, and never refilled drinks. Food was atrocious. Cold soggy fries, an overcooked steak well done when medium rare was asked for, mushy chicken tenders and breaded shrimp. Screaming children everywhere. One of the most well rounded places I've ever been in terms of failing at every aspect. Never again."}
{"text":"We've are here two times now and both times it was great. We love the bread.. So yummy!! First time we ordered porterhouse for two.. It was delicious.. They make the steak sauce by the table side which was cool even though we can care less for the sauce. Lol! The next time we ordered a ribeye and prime rib.. Both were also good.. Only reason for 3 stars is that the second time they didn't have mashed potatoes!!! Sucked, because I only like my steak with mashed potatoes!!! I was very disappointed since their mashed potatoes were really good the first time I had it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my entire family and had the greatest time. The food was just okay, what you would expect from a LongHorn, but the service was incredible! Andrew, our server, was SO great and helpful. He looked busy but took his time with us and really cared. Thank you again, Andrew!!!!"}
{"text":"Services is always pretty good... tonight is an exception.. I have eaten here multiple times. I like my filet medium well.. tonight it came out medium \"according to Google's pictures\" I spoke with 
The manager who offered to make a new filet for my wife.. she can take home... then I got the bill and they are charging for the food that they under cooked... our waitress explained that her filet was \"low medium\".. and next time I order I need to ask for \"high medium\"  this is total bs... looks like I need to look for new steak house to cook my filet med well.... really disappointed with the management of this location.."}
{"text":"Loved it! I ordered the flat iron steak as medium, and it was cooked to complete prefection. The cut was juicy and had just the right amount of pink. Our waitress was excellent and was a little funny too. The wait time wasnt bad at all and overall me and my party had a great experience. Will definitley come back!"}
{"text":"We got here about 3 pm on a Saturday.  We were seated quickly and drinks, appetizer, and meal came along quickly also.

Our waitress, Mary, was friendly and helpful and gave good attention to all the tables she was servicing.  Management made their rounds as well checking on everything,

The food was great!  It was still lunch time, and had the prime rib sandwich with the ever so tasty parmesan garlic fries.  Mind you, I'm not a big fan of French fries, but these were awesome.

Definitely get your monies worth here!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed in anything I've had here. We've been there 4 times with family  and for date night. It's nice enough for date night and noisy enough to bring kids. 

Obviously they are a steak house but they have a big offering of seafood and chicken as well. 

Always been too full to try dessert. Maybe one of these days."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because the food was fantastic, especially for a chain. I've worked in the service industry for over 10 years as a server, bartender, and manager. Last night we went to Longhorn for dinner. It was just after the rush, we sat at the bar. When we ordered a glass of wine and a soda, they were given to us and the bartender walked away. Apparently it's common for people to sit there and drink soda all night. After getting my own menu, we ordered. My side salad with French came smothered in Bleu Cheese. I tried it, but I just don't like Bleu cheese. I pushed the salad forward where it was never acknowledged again. We got our steaks and they were excellent, but we were never given the opportunity to tell them that as we were never asked. The guy that served us just wasn't trying, but that's not the worst part. There was another bartender on duty, frantically washing dishes. She never even made eye contact with us, let alone speak to us. Just washed dishes and complained about how long she'd have to stay there. And complained. And complained. Then made a mistake, muttered the \"f word\" and continued with her complaining. 

Despite the food, you couldn't pay me to go back there. Worst service I've ever had. Ever. What a shame. I guess that's why they can't keep a server more than 3 months."}
{"text":"Went there last night for my birthday with family. We went sort of early and the place was busy. Wait times were fine and got seated in time we were told so no issues there. 

Our waiter got our drink order pretty quickly but seemed a little distracted or uncaring. Not really sure what it was. 

When the bread came he brought it but no plates. Took a long time to get plates while the bread say and got cold basically. Turned out this was a sign of things to come, he was very unorganized and slow to respond to anything. 

When we got our salads 3 of us ordered the garden salad all with dressing on the side. They forgot one dressing all together and it literally took like 3 minutes or more for a manager to bring it out. In addition, one had like 20 croutons, other had 2 and mine literally had none. Zero consistency from the kitchen. My daughters Caesar salad had the butt from a head a lettuce. Really? Isn't that the first thing you throw out when chopping lettuce?

Every time a server brought something they seemed to set it in the middle of the table, never at the person it was for. They all seemed rather unfriendly (not sure how else to word that but they certainly didn't make you feel welcome) except one young girl with a pink bow in her hair (I didn't catch her name but she was a food runner I believe and was the only very friendly staff member). 

Overall the food itself was very good. Everyone enjoyed their meals and steaks for sure. No complaints there. I think the \"loaded\" bake potato is no where near loaded but that is my opinion of what a \"loaded\" baked potato should be. The sour cream, bacon and cheese were all very low levels IMO. But the potato was very good still. 

When our waiter brought to go boxes we ended up with 5 of them and he was nice enough to bring out to go cups with more sour cream, bacon, and cheese for the loaded potato I took home. However, with 5 to go boxes and 3 little to go cups he never brought a to go bag. We finally had to ask someone else for one. Again, he seemed distracted or unconcerned with us for the majority of the meal. I am not sure he even came back at any point to ask how things were and if we needed anything. 

It was my birthday and he did bring out a scoop of ice cream with some whipped cream and chocolate. Nothing wrong there, basic but that is ok. 

Like I said the food is pretty. Good but the service needs a lot of work. I don't care how busy you are, I still expect excellent service. From everyone."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and my dad (and my husband, daughter, and brother's fiancee). I called ahead to for their call ahead seating, since we knew we had 6 people, and being early evening, we were concerned that it would be busy. We got in right away when we got there.
The server was really good and very on point. We didn't go without anything. My husband and I almost always order the Porterhouse for 2, and sometimes we have to send it back due to it being overcooked. Not this time! The steak was perfect, and the sides were great as well.
We stayed for quite a while, and even after we paid the check, our server continued to make sure that our drinks were never empty, and never made it seem like they wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Two dirty salads.  Two more salads brought out, one was dirty.  (Did they just try to clean up the lettuce from the first two salads?)  Dirty bread plate.   Three managers stopped by during dinner to offer an apology.  The last manager offered two free desserts to take with us.  Oh, wow, how sincere, not.   Am I wrong to expect at least one dinner comp'd?  Rest of meal tasted good but chicken portion was considered small."}
{"text":"The food is ok. It's your typical greasy, cheese covered, super-sized entree type place but the food is alright and the mixed drinks are very good. Not my first choice for a steak dinner but probably my first choice if I'm in the mood for a good margarita... and also have a gift card for Longhorn Steakhouse for some reason."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to long horn, and it was a pretty good time. The service was great, we timed it right and got in and out right away. We started with the Texas cheese fries that was a huge serving. I got the ribs which fell off the bone, but I didn't care for the sauce. My wife raved about the steak."}
{"text":"This \"Steakhouse\" is a huge disappointment!!! Me and the Other Half (OH) have a standing Date Night every Friday and we love to try new and/or go back to local favorite places. He also loves to watch Food Network, has learned a lot from it and is now an excellent cook, thank Heavens! Point is we are adventurous eaters and usually avoid chains. This restaurant has just proved once again why!! The OH wanted steak though and didn't feel like traveling very far tonight, this restaurant is close by. 

It was busy but we were seated within the estimated 20-25 minutes. After being seated, we were handed a typical chain restaurant \"Specials\" menu loaded with pictures of their offerings along with a heavy leather bound novella of a menu, overkill, both are bad signs of what is to come. 

The waiter was timely, friendly, attentive, took our order right away and kept us well stocked on the drink refills. 

The starter Kettle Chips were decent but overly salty. THIS was the best part of our meal!! 

Our entree was the Porterhouse for 2. It seemed like a good deal for all you would be getting.... The green salads were obviously bagged salads that they add a little onion, cheese and croutons to. My lettuce was brown, I don't mean slightly! How could someone miss that, seriously? It showed a total lack of interest or care to serve anything that even looks appetizing. After alerting one of the many waitstaff zooming by, they brought me a new salad. Next, for our entertainment and fine dining pleasure, a lackluster presentation took place right at our table, steak sauce was mixed with rosemary, garlic and ?? This sauce was way too garlicky, we did not even attempt to garnish our steaks with it after taking a good whiff. Now onto the entree, still hopeful, but alas, disappointment galore! The Porterhouse requested preparation medium, was so undercooked, especially by the bone, I think that steer was still crying!! We could only stand to eat the edges of which was mildly enjoyable but over seasoned. The OH's green beans were a mystery khaki green/turd brown color and reportedly cold on the inside; he asked me to taste one, mustering up a tiny bite forced all the liquid inside to unexpectedly burst out and run down my chin, disgusting!! We guessed that those beans either sat too long after being blanched or had some frost-bite. In addition, the sweet potato was covered with so much cinnamon it was inedible!! 

While we sat for a bit, staring at this sad meal, the waiter came to check on us. Once we pointed out the errors of their kitchen staff's ways he offered to put the steak back on the grill. Really??? Anyone who knows anything about steak, should know that re-firing toughens up the meat. No! We don't want rubbery steak, thank you very much! The manager came by next and the OH asked \"Does this steak look medium to you?\" \"No\", he sheepishly admitted, \"It looks rare\". He tried to make amends by asking if we wanted something else or a re-order....We thought maybe they could get it right the second time around, we were sadly mistaken... 

My Filet side was closer to medium but the sirloin side was just as rare as before! The green beans were a lovely bright green this time but barely warm. My beautifully baked sweet potato was much better but only because they brought the butter and cinnamon on the side so I could apply it to my liking, duh!! 

In the end the manager never came back, the waiter offered a take home container but the OH, apparently frustrated, refused. The waiter came back once again, dropped off a check, said nothing and would not make eye contact. We do not hold the waiter responsible for this atrocious meal. At least the manager realized what part of the meal was barely acceptable to charge for, the bill only included the soda and Kettle Chips. Lesson learned cruel chain restaurant world, we will NOT be back!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this establishment and location. As a result, we likely won't be back to this location but may try another location to see if its better. Service was decent...the steaks were tasty and cooked to our request however the caesar salad was terrible. When our salads arrived, most of the lettuce had no dressing at all and only a small amount in the bottom of the bowl.  It was basically just lettuce with a trace of parmesean cheese and a few mass produced croutons.  When this was pointed out to our server, they replaced the salads but the replacement caesars were exactly the same.. Yes it is a steak joint but come on....what does it take to put some dressing on a salad?"}
{"text":"Ate here again on Saturday October 18, 2014. The food was exactly as expected but the service was really bad.  One star for service! The server asked me if I wanted a refill on my drink after I waved her over and I said yes please.... She came back with the bill. When she brought our salads out she came with 3 salads dropped off 2 at our table and took the 3rd to another table.  I thought it may have been my salad since they were all the same.  She came back to our table and I asked her if I could have my salad and she says oh you want yours now too.   I'm like WTH??? Ummmm yes I would like to eat at the same time as the rest of the people at my table..... Geezzz!  Very very slow service and the place was nearly empty.  The food is consistent though and worth going back."}
{"text":"Being a constant traveler for work, I regularly eat at Long Horn restaurants all over the USA. I read the Yelp reviews on this Long Horn and hesitated going in but I'm very glad I did!! On a busy Sunday 6pm dinner hour, I walked right in to an open chair at the bar and had my dinner & beer ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down. The service staff were, frankly, awesome! Amid a busy, sometimes chaotic environment, everyone kept their cool and handled challenges very professionally. My Cesar salad was served promptly. My steak was delivered a reasonable amount of time after and was hot & cooked exactly to my order. The bartender had been patient as I tried a few beers on tap before making my final choice. Several wait staff checked in on me regularly, including my primary server (very much a team effort there, which delighted me).  All in all, the service was prompt and generous and the food & beer was very good. As I ate, there were a few people who stood next to me to pick up their online orders for carry out, but that's part of sitting at a bar. There were plenty of people sitting outside, waiting on a table. But for me? It was an excellent choice for a prompt dinner in as busy place and I'll definitely return to this one for dinner #2!!"}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes to get a table. Not a problem. We understand they are busy. We got our table. We got apetizers but main plate never came out. We left."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Friday night. The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was vibrant.  Our server was on the spot with refills and bread.  The prime rib was excellent, as was the sides that accompanied the main dish.  Top notch service and food!"}
{"text":"Was not planning to eat here, running around from surprise. Agreeing to meet my cousin half way to eat. Well you see how far I was from Surprise!! Longhorn will be opening a new location in Surprise on April 1st! SO I guess this was a good way to see how their food was. 
Food:
Wife and I had their two for $20 meal, I went ahead and upgraded to a 8oz steak for an additional $3. Had my steak with a baked potato, and salad. Steak was really good, had a lot of flavor. I asked for it to be medium well. It was more on the rare side! It was still fine, I can eat my steak any way! Baked potato and salad were very good also. Wife had her 6oz steak well done, with broccoli and salad. She was very satisfied with her dish. We had their cheese fries as a appetizer, everyone was raving about this?? Don't know why! No big deal.
Service:
Our waiter was very good, he was always making sure our drinks were full, and came by a lot.

They only issue I had was their price, not his is not a high dollar steakhouse! But, it's still on the pricier side.

When they open up the Surprise location, we will be there."}
{"text":"Tried it for a second time. Came here for the salads. Red Robins ruined there salads thinking they are gourmet??? 
Well, rating stays the same. Salad is really over priced but very good. Especially the cornbread croutons. Tell you the truth, two people can really share one salad. Our service really took a hit. So, we will probably come again to share a salad. But after a year, they really haven't improved that much."}
{"text":"I live this place, great food and service.. I could go there and just eat the shrimp app by itself, yum"}
{"text":"Eachtime ive come they've forgotten something.. but always fixed it with no charge .. never have to wait long (Outback) foods fantastic so is the staff."}
{"text":"A group of us from work came here for lunch last week.  This is only the second time I've eaten here and I have no complaints. I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Strawberry Salad.  It's field greens with fresh strawberries, grapes, mandarin oranges, candied pecans, red onions, feta and raspberry vinaigrette. Instead of getting the chicken on top, i substituted for salmon instead. It was perfect!  Salmon was cooked exactly as ordered and our server was great. The only complaint I have is that I had to go back to work.  So if you're looking for great service and delicious food in Independence, try out Longhorn Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night with wife and another couple.   Fairly good service.  Friendly reception.  Not too loud, (but we did get there after 7PM... after the Early Birds left).  Drinks came pronto.  I ordered the 16oz T-Bone ...  medium  (pink center).  And it came that way!!  Baked potato with the works was fine.  But the \"T-Bone\" wasn't a T-Bone!  I really don't know what cut of beef it was.  A small odd shaped bone was in the meat.  But there was no \"tenderloin\" in this cut.  I was very disappointed that they would serve this and call it a T-Bone Steak and charge me the $25.00 for a mystery cut of meat.  Wife ordered the Rack of Lamb ... they were fine.  Salmon was good.  I'll probably go back some time.  But if they serve me another piece of beef like this...  I'll send it back.  Would have last night, but we had guests and I didn't want to make them wait."}
{"text":"Great service! From the hostess to the server, class act. Great food and atmosphere. Got filet and grilled corn cob. Excellent for the price. Very social staff. Nice to have since most young girls have an attitude, but not here. All were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Surprise AZ Longhorn last night, 4/20/2013. Long wait, 1 1/2 hours, place was packed. Four of us finally got seated. One of us ordered, one special serloin with bacon topping, two ordered prime ribs, one medium rate, one rare. Fourth person ordered half rack of ribs.
The person who ordered the serloin raved about it. When the prime ribs came out both were very rare, sent one back to get a medium rare. When it came out, looked like bad shoe leather. Quality of meat on both prime ribs was poor, tough and too much grissel/fat. Shoe leather serving was really tough. For $20/ serving the prime rib was terrible. Ribs were so so, small portion and just ok in taste,have had better for less.
Three of us had Ceasar salads, worst we've ever had, how can you screw up a ceasar salad.
On the bright side the waiter was very good.
Won't be going back, even if no wait. Food was poor."}
{"text":"It is a  typical chain restuarant similar to Black Angus, but cost little more. Staffs are friendly, seating is conformable."}
{"text":"After my prior review, I was contacted by the management team. They assured me that they were concerned with my experience and wanted to make it right. I returned last night with a gift card provided months ago and was pleasantly surprised. We were seated and provided a cold drink immediately. The food was great. My steak was perfect. The dessert was heavenly. The waitress was wonderful...super attentive and friendly. The manager was visibly present and involved within the restaurant. Great job!"}
{"text":"For me, a business shows its strength when they have to deal with a situation. This was the first time if been back to this location since it burned down. Saturday and there was a reasonable wait. We were seated and approached for a drink in a timely manner. We ordered and were served promptly. My prime rib was cooked to order but the cut was extremely fatty. At least a third of the serving was fat. I hated to bring this to the waitress's attention but she saw what I was going to tell her before I even pointed it out. She got the manager and my meal was replaced. 

This really impressed me. I'd definitely return here again. Also, the new decor is really neat."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have stopped in for a steak dinner. The food was very good both times . I like having a good steak house in the area. We had a younger waiter this time and the service was not there. I noticed for a busy Friday night alot of younger people working, next time I will ask for a seasoned server."}
{"text":"Finally tried this one and my previous experiences have been completely erased. Other than it taking a few minutes for someone to come up front to seat us that was the it for a bad experience. Our server was amazing and on top of everything. The meal was cooked to perfection and the dessert was decadent. I'll choose here over any other place nearby."}
{"text":"I'm finally ponying up to the bar, figuratively speaking, to post a review of this particular LongHorn.  Now to be fair, let it be known that I'm not a huge fan of chains and being Kansas City born and bred, I think we know steak.  So, that out of the way, let's continue.

I've been in this LongHorn at least 4 or 5 times.  It's not my first choice but it's convenient to where I need to be/go and so it just happens.  Each time, I've sat at the bar.

The food is, well..., LongHorn.  It wasn't bad, wasn't good, wasn't memorable, but was quite edible.  Even though I order medium-rare, they've gotten it right about half the time and the rest of the time it's over-done.  I usually get a Merlot or Cab by the glass and in every case, it tasted as it should.  

That's the good part of the review.

Now let me say that there is a bartender that has worked at the bar EVERY single time I've been there in the past year.  I can't remember his name, but I wish I could because I would call ahead next time to find out if he's working.  If he is, I'd go somewhere else.

He's ambivalent to your presence, ignoring you for long periods of time, never cracking a smile.  If he were just business, that would be great with me, but in fact, he won't warn you of things important to you as a diner.  Steaks come with a veggie, but he doesn't mention that asparagus has a surcharge.  He also once didn't mention that he brought me a different wine because he was out of the other one.  I tasted a difference and asked, upon which he admitted it.  I guess the Bud Light crowd won't catch that one, eh?

These are mistakes that we'd forgive a server when they're nice, talkative, polite, and interesting.  He's none of those.

So, I finally decided next time that if I walk in and he's there, I'm walking out and driving over to the Rusty Bucket on Kruse Drive.  It's worth the extra 5 minutes, folks."}
{"text":"Unlike Dr. Who's Tardis, which is small on the outside and big on the inside, this steakhouse looks large on the outside, but surprisingly small once you are inside. I went for lunch (11:15am). I know this is a chain owned by the same company that owns the Red Lobster and Olive Garden, so I was not expecting a mom and pop local experience. That was good because my first impression was this was a 3.75 star experience (I rounded up to 4). 
Let's start with the decor--every western cliche you ever heard of is here. A couple of horse saddles hanging from the ceiling, shelves of cowboy boots, pictures of the Grand Canyon, wild horses running and a waterfall at Yosemite, photos of cowboys at rodeos, map of Texas, and a whole wall of western belt buckles. Not just a casual decoration of the place--nearly every wall or surface is plastered with this stuff (sometimes less is more). The background music was country and western.
The seating hostess and server were very prompt, attentive, and just plain nice. The server brought warm whole grain bread and butter right away. I got the western mac n cheese and soup lunch combo for just $6.99. Now the motto here must be \"Bacon hides bland food really, really well.\" The soup was a broccoli cheddar/asiago cheese with bacon bits. The mac n cheese had toasted bread crumbs on top and was loaded with bacon. The combo comes with homemade warm potato chips covered in cheese sauce and--you guessed it--bacon. Ironically, the cheese sauce in the soup, the mac n cheese and on the chips all tasted the same. There was no variation (do they get this from a can or something?).
Now, I know this is a steakhouse and I was scoping it out for a later dinner with my husband. So I watched attentively as an older couple at the table next to my booth dug into their steaks. They hacked and sawed and practically had to chisel the meat into bit sized pieces. After watching this struggle, I am guessing that these steaks are not especially tender. I can't say for sure, but that certainly didn't encourage me to order steak from here.
Parking was easy and close to the door. Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I am eating a sirloin and not the filet I ordered. Not tender, overlooked and thin. Last week I ordered a medium filet and it was raw in the middle, so today I ordered medium well and there was not even a touch of pink. No continuity in food preparation."}
{"text":"Definitely on my list of places to return to. The service was excellent the food was delicious.  I can see why a waiting time was necessary, Because so many people were there to enjoy family time and great food.  I highly recommend the Calamari  as an appetizer it's sweet and spicy!  The night ended on a sweet note with mountain mountain top of cheesecake and volcano brownie....."}
{"text":"Everything is great whenever I go to this location. It's a chain so nothing that unique but the staff is friendly and I like their steaks better than any pricey one I have had. The firecracker shrimp is the best."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites. The appetizers, sides, steaks are always fresh, tasty, and well served. The servants are welcoming, friendly, and responsive. :)"}
{"text":"I had an awesome perky and funny waitress who seemed to persevere even though she was overworked! It seemed she was responsible for way too many tables than she should have. I had the shrimp skewers...oh my God I'm addicted! They are heaven! You must get the grilled shrimp! So flavorful and there's so many of them and you get it over a bed of rice with two sides! Lots of food! I got broccoli and fries. Fries are perfectly salted and thin like I like! Broccoli was even good! 
Let's not forget the new wings they have ! I got them as an appetizer! They come with this amazing Buffalo sauce !! The wings are well seasoned so if you don't like a lot of salt and seasoning then don't get them! Mine were a tad bit overcooked but still good and they are meaty and decent sized!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my sister in law had parmesan crusted chicken with Mac and cheese and my boyfriend had 11oz sirloin with Mac and cheese. Overall not very satisfied ... It was good but price, proportion and service was horrible . Total came out to almost 100$ . Don't think I'll come again ...  cheesecake was desert and was not the best ! Oh by the way hubby ask for ribeye steak and they  we're out so he was forced to get something else. Slow day and server came about 2 times .."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere, the waiter was very attentive but did forget to mention that the steaks we already seasoned so no need for salt...we had the Outlaw Ribeye Steak bone in dinner. The Ribeye steak was huge and cooked to perfection! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The appetizers sound really good but usually come out below expectations (picture). Their steaks are just ok as well. We ordered a prime rib. The size was good but super tough. Definitely not \"so tender you can cut with a fork\" like is advertised."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

What bothers me most about the restaurant chain, is that they have a chance to have something remotely healthy for people to eat, but then they go a slather the steak in oil and butter.  The quality of the meat is ok, but they drench it to make it really juicy.  A good steak DOES NOT need oil and butter to taste good.  A little salt and pepper is all it should take.  Maybe a touch of olive oil.  But you won't find that at Longhorn.  Instead, the plate is covered in a layer of grease which most people slop up with their endless buckets of bread, or scoop up in their mashed potatoes.  

When i'm traveling i usually eat here if its a long trip, but I always regret it afterward.  Their salad with a grilled chicken breast isn't bad if you need something healthy.  otherwise, you are shit out of luck."}
{"text":"Went with my mother for lunch today, she insisted on soup and salad.  Server was Kelly.  My 91 year old mother asked what kind of soup they had, answer: \"It's printed on the menu\".  We both asked for no croutons so of course we each got about two cups of them.  Also got a 2 by 3 inch piece of stale bread for the two of us.  Soup was fair, salads bad, no water refills."}
{"text":"We've only been here once.  I got the 6 oz renegade sirloin which was about the same quality as something for half the cost from Ponderosa.  Wife and daughter had the chicken fingers.  Had to sit in a booth next to a floor table that had a family of kids that spent an hour running around screaming playing 'tag'.  Can't management say anything?  We were so nervous that we left without our leftover boxes."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and it never disappoints! Great atmosphere that's warm and welcoming. Service is always courteous and friendly. And the meals are reasonably priced and are delicious as well. I had the short ribs and it was outstanding. The salads are always super crispy and fresh! So many times that's what many restaurants forget- if the base of your salad isn't crisp and fresh the salad no matter what you throw on it it's not good! Here they obviously pay attention to those little details that consistently make it an enjoyable evening! Thanks Longhorn!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, and GREAT service.  Definitely recommend this restaurant.  The Mac and cheese is the best we ever had. Would definitely go there again when we are back on Arizona,"}
{"text":"BEWARE NO FREE INTERNET.

Let's face it,  when you are at lunch and want to get caught up now a days free internet access is universal. Even McDonald's has it. The food otherwise is ok. They constantly try to up sell you. 2 and a half is about it here. Nice decor."}
{"text":"The short story: overcooked, dried out burger, oversalted fries and boring salad. What's there to like?

I gave this other place another try for a late lunch - I got there at 2:30pm, there was maybe a half a dozen customers around. I'd said I'd rather sit on a chair than in a booth, I was given a chair .... in a corner, facing the wall, in an empty restaurant.

This seems to be the norm in Charlotte and I decided not to worry about it.  All I wanted was a medium rare burger w/ bacon (no cheese) and fries. The waitress says they don't do MR, only medium and I decided to leave. The waitress ran to the kitchen and confirmed that they will accommodate my order. 

OK, three or four very annoying Dolly Parton songs (I think) later the burger arrives. I gave it one bite and a chunk of dried out ground beef fell out. Sure enough the burger was not MR, M or even MW it was simply well done, as in FU. 
Zero stars

Waiting for the waitress to return I had some of the fries but in spite of my hunger I had to stop because they were waaaay too salty, way more than last time and way more that is healthy.  
One star

Waitress came, said \"that's not m.r.\" then sent over the manager who asked what I wanted to do. Told her I didn't trust the guy to cook me another burger and I ordered the flat iron steak instead. She also agreed to replace my fries with a house salad with a so called balsamic vinaigrette.  
 
The salad arrives almost immediately and it's ... nothing but tasteless and without interest. I can't believe they would serve a salad like this alongside a $30 steak, it belonged in family restaurant, a cheap one at that. 

The steak had a pink center (medium) and again rubbed with the pepper sauce which no one asked me about. I ate, paid and left. What can I say about a steakhouse that can't prepare the meat, the salad or the fries right other than \"no thanks\"?

I still had a $25 gift certificate from corporate for the last fiasco that I was saving for a dinner but I chose to give it away rather than eating here ever again.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4/17 Edit: Longhorn corporate doesn't bother to contact disgruntled customers anymore than their restaurants do."}
{"text":"I have no negative review of this trip to LongHorn. 
The service and the food were excellent. 
It was a little early in the evening and it wasn't crowded at all. We did not have to wait for a seat. 
The server came quickly to take our order.
The food came out quickly, hot and to my liking. 
We will return. It is not one we frequent regularly, but we do have dinner here every other month or so."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service and the Half Shredded Prime Rib Sandwich and Loaded (and I do mean loaded) potato soup is stupendous"}
{"text":"When asked where I wanted to have my Birthday dinner, I chose Longhorn Steakhouse because I had heard great things about it, plus if the smell of a cooked steak dinner doesn't entice one's senses, what will, right? 

Started out in the bar with drinks and appetizers. Hubby had a draft beer, I had a Sour Apple Martini. First time I'd ever had one and wow, I LOVED it enough to have a second one before our two friends arrived to have dinner with us. We ordered Firecracker Chicken Wraps and Housemade Chips & Dip. I enjoyed both of them, but the chips and dip were by far the best! Imagine homemade kettle chips and a freshly-made in-house dipping sauce with a smoky flavor and taste and you have exactly what it is. Perfect snack to precede the meal. 

When our friends arrived, they ordered their drinks and the four of us were escorted by the hostess to our table. For dinner, I chose the 6 oz Smoky Sirloin, cooked medium...just the way I like it...and I had a Sweet Potato with butter & cinnamon on it and a Mixed Greens Salad with Ranch dressing. The waiter brought bread and butter to our table to go with our meal as well and I had a couple small pieces of it....and they serve COKE ZERO :)

I took the rest of my meal home since I could not finish it, but leftovers from a great place are ALWAYS a treat in itself!

I was VERY impressed with my meal; the portions were just right, my meal was cooked just the way I enjoy it, and everything was delicious! Our waiter was Kevin and he was awesome! His service was top-notch, he always had a smile, was very friendly and helpful, and we even offered and left him a piece of my Birthday cake as a way of saying Thank You for the awesome service he provided...and I know he got a great tip too. He totally deserved it!

By the way, if you love Western decor, you will love the looks of this restaurant. All decked out in Western motif, from the metal benches outside with a Longhorn symbol on them, to the mantle inside with pairs of cowboy boots lined up on it, to the flair inside and the country music playing in the background,,, you will certainly enjoy the ambience and atmosphere this restaurant provides! 

I can't wait to enjoy another meal there again!"}
{"text":"Longhorn has always done a great job with service. They're Moscow miles are the bomb! Last time we were in, our food came to our table \"warm\" like it has been sitting out for a min. Also, very basic plating. Just a steak and a scoop of mashed potatoes on a plate. Lol. Overall, always good food."}
{"text":"We sat forever before we were served by the poor waitress who had the whole dining room at 4 PM. I know that's early for dinner, but it's because we had somewhere to be and this place almost made us late - which doesn't really help you enjoy your meal. The food itself was okay - chicken bites were soaked in the sauce they came in (not sure why it came with a huge side container of the same sauce), my steak salad was decent (steak was tiny but fine with me), and boyfriend ate his meal and took a burger home. We had a gift card to spend and won't go back until we get another one, and we now know to sit at the bar if you're in a hurry during slow times since they cut down to just 1 server before the big dinner rush."}
{"text":"If you have not had Parmesan crust on your LongHorn burger then you have not lived! There are a few things I like on the menu like the strawberry and chicken salad, Parmesan crusted chicken, ribeye, etc but a burger with this topping is scrumptious! I order mine medium well with mayo, onions and Parmesan crust. Based on dining here on secret different occasions, I would rate this location a 4."}
{"text":"It was a Tuesday and it was the busiest I have ever seen this place on a weekday. It was crowded but our server Amanda S. was still great. My drink was not right and she replaced it with a new one and did not charge me for the drink which was really nice. I left a generous tip for being so nice. My friend, he ordered an appetizer and burger and said it was cooked perfectly. For being so busy I was surprised it was not over cooked. The service and food was great and I will be back. We were there a really long time because it was busy but we did not mind because how well everything was."}
{"text":"For a Friday evening this place was pretty easy to get a seat right away. For the appetizer we ordered the blooming onion, it was pretty good, the dipping sauce was a little tart. Dinner I got the pork chops. I have had that's before here. I think they need to put some type of flavoring on it. Not much to it. But this is not the stores fault but an idea for the company. Service was good. No problems there as the waitress was very attentive. The standard salad we all got had some random other leaves in it, seems like they mixed two different types together but not a big problem."}
{"text":"This place was awful!

 The service was good but the manager seemed like he was constipated or appeared to have a stick up his ass. The taste of the steak wasn't the best... And on top of it, my poor mom got food poisoning. 
Server was a total doll though. 

DO NOT GO HERE! Go to Texas Roadhouse, cheaper and service and food is much better."}
{"text":"Ordered Prime Rib as a take out.  It was delicious.  Picked up at the bar and the serverss was gracious and friendly."}
{"text":"The server was cool the food took a little long, but the real upset was when the manager named tony came up cause my brothers food was too dry and when he came out he was rude about it but took it off after some convincing. That's why it's only a 2 stars the manager was terrible"}
{"text":"Whole family was in the mood for a steak tonight, so we thought we would try this new location. The decor and abeyance were outstanding, classy while also embracing the rustic. We ordered the Garlic Mussels & Texas Tonion as appetizers. The mussels were very fresh and tasted superb. Frankly, they were better then the ones I ordered in a San Diego Sea Food Restaurant .  The Texas Tonion was crisp and the sauce out of this world! My wife and I ordered a Porterhouse and my daughter a Ribeye all were cooked exactly as ordered. They were all amazing, the misses said its the best stake that she has had in 3+ years.  Our server was first class ask for \"Rhona S\" she was on top of all our needs, our glasses never went dry.."}
{"text":"Usually not a fan of chains. But I have to say that LongHorns makes one mean steak! Cooked perfectly along with excellent sides. The waitress was fantastic and had a great sense of humor. Might be my go to steak house heard"}
{"text":"I and my partner went in on Sunday the 17th, for a nice steak dinner, I had been craving the oh so good, wild west shrimp appetizer so we go to Longhorn Champaign. at 8pm on a Sunday, it was not very busy about 5 - 6 tables, servers were cleaning up. **  Now we always go to dinner expecting to spend $100, and leave happy. **

I totally forgot to ask for my favorite server Tamisha, (but she did come over and say hi.) Our server was ok. not memorable, but I think she was just ready to get out of their.  

So the server took brought us pour drinks, and then shortly after the wild west shrimp, which was oh so good.  We placed our order (which is our usual) I ordered the Outlaw bone in ribeye medium rare, with asparagus, and added a lobster tail and a garden salad with ranch.  My partner ordered a 11oz Renegade with Mashed potatos medium well.

After about 15 - 20 minutes our steaks come, and I cut into my ribeye, to notice it is elaning more to the rare side, than medium rare, but becasue we were hungry and other things to do before the evening ended I told the server it was not cooked right, but I would endure it, til I cut even further into it, and it was even more deeper red.  I pushed it aside, ate my asparagus and lobster tail, and then called for a manager.  My Partners steak was overcooked, however he ate it anyway. and it was dry and tough.

So after about 5 minutes a male manager with glasses comes out carrying a pitcher and a glass of pepsi.  HE comes to the table with refill drinks, and not asking about our meal, but then wants to refill my drink, a very odd way to approach a table with poor quality food, I then proceeded to tell him, that my steak was underdone, he then tried to explain to me that LONHORNS medium rare was light cooked on the outside with a  warm red center, ( No matter how you cook it, MEDIUM RARE IS MEDIUM RARE at longhorn, at Alexanders, at any other steakhouse.  I told him to not insult my intelligence, and he then asked me if i wanted the steak thrown back on the grilll ( which is a health violation) or a new steak. so I said I would like a new steak not thinking, that I would wait, and my partner was already finished, and then I would be rushed to eat it, etc, so I got it to go, but you really do not want to do that with steak, as you lose the quality.  Anyway, TAMISHA came back by, and I was able to have a nice chat with her, and told her if we come back we will make sure she is our server, and we will make sure that ALONZO, the best Grill Master this restaurant has, is working. I told TAMISHA, that that we wanted our check and could we get the steak to go,as we were tired.  She said sure,and went back to the back.  

So we never saw our server, after she cleared our plates, we were never offered dessert  (I was hoping for that new dessert, a female manager came out and brought our food to go, and said she was sorry, and that they dropped the ball, and our bill was taken care, which I was thankful, but that was unnecessary.

ALL IN ALL THIS experience , like the few times we have had in the past is hit or miss,  that is why we cut our visits down, we used to come weekly, but you can never count on the quality or service every visit."}
{"text":"This statehouse is near our home, so it was the best option to go on a cold night like yesterday. No regret! The place did not smell as it used to do in the past. Great! The service was good. No complaints. The food was as usual. The best option: the outlaw ribeye. The prime rib was not bad, not excellent. Could be better! The Caesar salad and other sides, eg. fries and baked potato were good. As usual. Price is reasonable. We had a wonderful pleasure night I would have given five stars if the quality of their prime ribs had been better."}
{"text":"This place is a ZERO star place.  Stay away.

If you like butter and cream sauce to saturate everything on your plate than this is your place.  I ordered the crispy Parmesan Chicken and expected something along the line of the crispy chicken Parmesan tradition.  Instead I got two really fatty soggy chicken breasts soaked beyond belief in a thick untasty cream sauce.  Both my dining associate and myself got salads and mine was decent size but he got the junior edition with maybe 4 bits of leaf in it.  It was laughable. 

I spent the next hour on the toilet.

This place was terrible beyond belief, and very expensive as well.

I took my son here who ordered a very expensive dinner of trout, shrimp and lobster.  When they served it his plate had a small filet of trout on it.  I asked the waitress where were the shrimp and lobster.  She said the filet was stuffed with them.  That's not what the menu said.  The menu said it had Trout, Shrimp and Lobster and gave it a $18 price.  So to get a small piece of fish and no shrimp, no lobster was a bit of a lie.

I will never go to Longhorn again and tell everyone to stay away."}

This one location just lost every opportunity for my repeat business. NEVER again!"}

We got the pretzel sticks with the beer cheese for an app and it was super tasty!
Our waiter Todd was really nice and really attentive. He exemplified great service!
We ordered our steak medium and it came more like well done so we sent it back and they made us a new one really quickly and it was flavorful and delicious (they also comp'ed it from the tab which was incredibly surprising, unexpected). The portions are a good size, enough for us to share. 
We ordered dessert but were too full to eat it and took it to go. 
Overall positive experience. Definitely will return."}

{"text":"I visited this LongHorn Steakhouse last night. I ordered a Portherhouse, Medium Rare, Caesar salad, Baked Potato with chives, sour cream, butter.  The waitress reiterated to both of us at the table, after ordering Medium Rare that is was a blood red center, yes, we said.  My order was brought to the table by our young waitress.  Now if you're going to pay $26 for a steak, and order it Medium Rare, you would expect a steakhouse to serve it, Medium Rare.  My order was more Medium, no blood red center, and my baked potato had bacon on it.  A man named Ray I believe came to the table before we even cut into our steaks and asked us how they looked.  I hadn't cut into mine, but I know Medium Rare when I see it, and I asked him if he knew what Medium Rare looked like, I had made 3 cuts around my steak, he said, yes, in fact I'm an expert. I then asked him to look at my steak, which he did, he agreed that it was not Medium Rare and he took it away to make me another. While waiting for about 15 minutes, I ate my salad and my potato, my friends steak was checked, a Ribeye, Medium Rare, cooked to perfection, and Ray agreed. My steak was brought to my table, with another baked potato, my 3rd one, which I didn't touch, and the steak was cooked Medium Rare. I ate about 3 oz, and took the rest home. I appreciate Ray's attention to us, and want to give a shout out to him. Perhaps he should be in the kitchen overseeing the doneness ordered."}

\"Yes Robin. There must be a spell over the citizens of Surprise. This could  be the work of the Joker.

{"text":"We get here a few  times a month and really like it.  Solid  menu, quality food and every time we have great servers.  For lunch  -  recommend the Grilled chicken, Strawberry salad  or the 7 pepper sirloin salad - , burgers or the grilled chicken avocado sandwich. . Dinner the steaks are good as well as the Salmon or Tilapia  with mango salsa.    The bar is nice - bartenders are always cool and sometimes let me have the DTV remote... Bonus!"}
{"text":"Was told that it will be a 30-40 minutes wait and given a buzzer. Walked around in other stores a bit. The buzz rang after 10 minutes.

After ordering, waited for the salad for maybe 15 minutes. Then after the salad, received the steak in 10 minutes.

Ordered a med-rare \"Outlaw Ribeye\", it was well seasoned but a chunk of it was still rare. Didn't call the waitress on it but was expecting more consistency on that piece of meat. The side ba

Overall, pleasant experience, the lighting was relaxing and the place was not too loud.  The price is acceptable, if it wasn't for that rare chunk of meat."}
{"text":"Good experience today at Longhorn. Our server Dale took excellent care of us. He was very upbeat and friendly. 
Regular order, Outlaw for me, Flo's filet plus baby back ribs for hubby. Ranch salad and parmesan spinach for my and fries for hubby. 
This time we ordered dessert! Mixed berries lava cake for me and gold rush apple for hubby. They both were very good."}
{"text":"Eating their new Briskett Nacho appetizer right now,,,, and they are amazing!!! Not sure what's in the sauce but it's really good. Waited for a good 1.5 hours... it's busy everywhere. Looking forward to their filet."}
{"text":"All the guys in our family love steak, so this has always been a destination for my family and I just for casual dining on a Sunday night.  The waiters are always pleasant and even conversational, and they're really on top of things.  The sides and salads are great, and the steaks are cooked just the way we each prefer.  The flavor of the steaks are just okay though, mine personally was a bit too salty last time.  But it doesn't take away that this is still a great place to be a repeat customer at."}
{"text":"Out of all the mid-level steak franchise joints - Outback, Logans, Texas, Lonestar, etc.... this is by far my favorite.   I have eaten at the Huntersville  LongHorn about a half dozen times, always the Cowboy Ribeye.  It is consistently perfect.    A whole lot better than nasty Outback, but not as pricey as the next tier up of steakhouses.  The bar area is hopping most nights with traffic and good conversation."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. Food came fast and server was great. However, I asked for medium well steak and it came out between rare and medium. Red juice running all over the plate. I sent it back and they were very nice about it. When they brought it back they asked me to check it before they walked away which was good but I didn't want to send it back twice. Second time it was well done no pink at all. The strawberry salad was amazing. I would give 4 Stars because of the service but ranking it lower because of the food."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since I have given a chain restaurant 4 and a half stars, but comparing it with its kind, it's actually pretty awesome.   I got the opportunity to try a sampling of several appetizers, sides, steak, and desserts .  What a pleasant surprise!   

Some must haves...
- The pretzel sticks appetizer.  Soft inside and salty outside, with two dipping sauces that really complimented it well.   
- The fried shrimp appetizer.  Plentiful and delicious with some banana peppers and ranch dipping sauce.   
- The steak!   I ordered the filet, cooked to a perfect medium rare.   
- The mac and cheese.  I didn't order it, but looked on with envy as one of my companions devoured it.   
- The chocolate dessert.   This thing was massive.   MASSIVE.   More than enough for two people and really better suited for four.  For $6.   What?   And it was delicious.  Not terribly rich for as much chocolate as it was, which i appreciated.   

What really sold me on this place though was the service.  I went with a very large party (20 people) and the staff did a great job.   There was one little snafu with a steak - the manager didn't like how it looked and didn't serve it, which meant that person ate a little after everyone else.  We didn't really care, but they were super apologetic and even gave him a gift card for the trouble.  Above and beyond for sure."}
{"text":"This is to review our visit on Friday March 18th around 6:30pm. My family and I typically go to Longhorn about once a month and its usually one of our favorites. I have noticed a decline in quality over the past year, but still a good meal...not this time. 

Only a 10 minute wait for a table, not bad for a Saturday night! We decided on the Crab and Artichoke Dip for an appetizer...HUGE mistake!!! This literally tasted like tuna fish from a can with a few pieces of artichoke floating in it. It was supposed to have four cheeses...more like cream of something soup. It was lukewarm and served with very hard fried bread. Just awful!

I ordered a ribeye with creamed Parmesan spinach. My steak was cooked properly, I ordered it medium, but the spinach was odd tasting...I cannot put my finger on it (my daughter said it tasted \"fishy\"). The cut of ribeye seemed like an old slab of prime rib that was then grilled. Mostly fat...huge pieces of fat. My husband ordered the full slab of ribs. He said they were dry (over cooked) and just a bad cut, hardly any meat and the sauce has changed, and not for the better. 

Trying to catch our waiter turned into a game! If we could get him to the table, he was very nice...if you could catch him! 

Unfortunately, Longhorn will be leaving our rotation of restaurants. After spending over $90 for a family meal, with this low quality of food, I think we will steer clear!"}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch spot for my friends. Great staff, service is always quick and friendly. I like the steaks but they have a full range of foods and drink for any palate."}
{"text":"Excellent, delectable, A++++++service.  It was well worth the 30 minute wait. We had Denise for our service. She raised the bar when it came to accommodation.  With a full section I witnessed her handle it like a pro. No customer went neglected. The grilled talapia and shrimp was way beyond tasteful. Will come back again next time I'm in Charlotte North Carolina. Military discount here."}
{"text":"The manager Carlos was friendly and very approachable!! He gave us the comfortable feel as customers. Oh honey and our waiter Jason was dynamic at knowledge great personality and informative on the menu without looking at it. I'll be back to the Mallard Creek Road in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"The Outlaw Ribeye is Outstanding.  The ribeye taste was perfect.  So juicy and scrumptious.  Best ribeye steak in the area.  

I also ordered the French Onion Soup, which was very good.  Spaghetti Squash, interesting and fun to eat.  And the red rock grilled shrimp skewer, pretty decent.  Baked Potato, it's decent.  

The steak was the most outstanding.  They changed how they did it.  The juices and flavor hit my body in all right places.  I hadn't had steak that good in ages.   I'm only referring to the ribeye here.  Service was very good at 6:30 PM on a Friday with Kelli."}
{"text":"This is the best ribeye steak I've had for under $35 (it's only $20.99).  Wow!! This location has really high standards.  I've been to other locations and they just don't compare.  Slightly salt but otherwise the taste was most perfect.  We both though it was the best.

The mushroom appetizers were so-so.

Cocktail drinks are good."}
{"text":"Always great food and good portions. We prefer long horn steakhouse over any other steak house."}
{"text":"Let me start with I have been here twice (and I really didn't want to write this negative review). 

I was very excited when I saw Longhorn was coming to the area. I have been severely disappointed each time. The service is by far the worst and at one point we had to ask for our salads. The first time we went, the kitchen messed up our order (at least that's what the manager told us after we waited nearly 40 minutes and then after that it took another 20 minutes to get our food). 

Tonight my steak was so over cooked. We waited so long, she offered another but I just said no. They wound up comping my meal. I must have noticed at least 4 others in the same boat. I like LongHorn. 

I hope they get it figured out."}
{"text":"Their food exeteamly well cooked. Their salads are always fresh not soggy  lettuce or tomatoes!  Their steaks are always cooked the way u like!  If you eat at the Bar..you want to get there in the late afternoon or evening when Bartender Ken is on. He's just Awesome !"}
{"text":"Good for lunch!

I am going to be honest - if I want a steak then I will go to Meat and Potatoes or another local steakhouse (Capital Square, etc...).

This is a great stop for lunch.   I usually get the (Meat / Salad).    Recently I have been getting the Salmon.

The Salmon has good flavor.   The salad has all the yummy little bits one expects.    It ranges for about $10-15.    It is quick and I am back at work with a full tummy.

I will go back but it is nothing special from other establishments.

Service - always good
Food - pretty good but not compared to the local establishments (See Yelper reviews)
Price - very reasonable ($10-15 for lunch)"}
{"text":"After a truly horrendous experience at a Longhorn Steakhouse in Florida 8 months ago we finally got up the nerve to try the new location by Paradise Valley Mall.  It started out promising and I was optimistic this would be a better experience.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, brought our drinks out in a timely manner, took our order, got our salads out quickly.  From there things went downhill.  We had ordered an appetizer.  After the salads we sat there and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Our entrees arrived via the manager.  He asked if we needed anything else.  I told him we were still waiting on our appetizer.  He said he would put in the order for us (apparently our waitress had forgotten) and would make sure it got taken off the bill.  We had a coupon for a free appetizer anyway but the gesture was nice.  My meal of pork chops and mashed potatoes was extra greasy and drenched in butter.  My husband did not finish his steak or baked sweet potato.  Our appetizer of parmesan crusted asparagus was by far the highlight of the meal.  After we finished eating we sat there and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Our waitress started to hurry by us about 20 minutes later and we had to ASK her for the check.  It was a very disappointing experience and nothing about it would entice me to eat at a Longhorn Steakhouse again."}
{"text":"Great filets! they cook perfectly! side dishes are also wonderful! Staff is extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant really blew us away with the preparation and fresh ingredients.  I now understand that the national group that owns it has superior organic standards (this location buys their lettuce for salads from a farm in cranberry!) and quality standards, cutting fresh steaks daily.  Their salad dressing are also preservative free, thank you!!!!  The managing partner Karen came out to our table and greeted us and answered our questions about the menu and prep.  She has dedicated her entire career to food service and her management style has certainly proven to be excellent at this location!  We will be back soon knowing the food is fresh, the quality is superior and it doesn't break your wallet!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit.  The 1st time was grand opening week. It was just okay.  So we came back and again just okay.  I am from Texas and this place is not a Texas steak.  It was \" grilled\" not open flamed, char broiled.  The Ribeye was way to fatty and even had some gristle.  The sirloin was a thick cut, well portioned, the cook did not seem to know medium ftom medium rare.. the steak was still mooing!  The sides were good and the sweet tea was good. Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and good at her job.
I do not think we will be back, just not up to my caliber of steak."}
{"text":"The service was great,  the salads were good,  the bread lacked flavor.   We ordered the filet and lobster tail, one for each.   We asked for the steak medium,  they were both over cooked but that was the only complaint.   The food is amazing,  so much flavor.  Worth the price.  We found our new steak restaurant"}
{"text":"*Meh* and *shrug* is the best way to describe this Longhorn chain restaurant.  Their meats aren't very tasty nor flavorful and waits for your food to arrive are often too long for what you get and for the price.  It also seems they compensate for lack of flavor across the board by adding way too much sugar or salt in everything.

In the times I've been here I've had overcooked meat and undercooked veggies.

One of the positives about this place is that it was renovated in 2011 in which they opened and brightened up the ambiance while keeping that \"Western ranch\" decor.

This is one of those places I go because of convenience to co-workers only.  And when we do go, I usually order the black n' bleu burger - because the bleu cheese, not the meat, is something I don't normally eat at home.  Based on the taste nothing else on the menu really stands out (except for the basket of warm bread you get in the beginning)."}
{"text":"Well we come to our local LongHorn ask to be seated in Ms. Pam section as we always do. Host said it wold be 15 minutes told him not a problem. Well 25 minutes later no seating however he sent someone in her section that came in after us. Currently I am not happy and may never come back here again"}
{"text":"I ordered a steakhouse bacon burger. It came with no bacon and the lettuce, tomato and pickles were as cold as little ice slivers. It made the whole burger cold, including the bun. I asked the manager if my burger was supposed to have bacon on it. He had no idea. I told him it was the steakhouse burger but he still didn't know. He did say he would make sure I wasn't charged for bacon since I didn't get any. They took a WHOLE DOLLAR off my bill. On the plus side, we did not get seated right next to the kitchen door like the last couple times. I think this will be our last visit."}
{"text":"While it is a chain, we had a great experience here. I've been here several times before and never been disappointed. If we're comparing steak houses that are $18-25 in range, this place is wonderful. Our server was superb. Gave us space but checked it appropriately. Not sure how she did it but she timed our bread, then appetizers, then, salad, then entree just perfectly so food settled and you're ready for the next. 

We ordered the calamari which had a nice tangy, slightly spicy flavor.
The salads are of course, salads - fresh. I happen to enjoy a nice fresh, house salad so that's a plus. 
We ordered a couple of entrees. Sirloin with shrimp (omg there were 8 shrimp on skewers. I was expecting 4 shrimp) and a loaded baked potato... and another sirloin with rack of ribs and loaded baked potato as well. All juicy... perfectly cooked to order. Both the shrimp and ribs were great add ons and did not disappoint. I was only able to finish half my plate. Happy tummy."}
{"text":"A very tasty and tender 8 oz sirloin  lightly seasoned and off the hook in house mac and cheese! Go early here as the retirement community consumes much of the seating. Crazy cheap too. Service is great as are the drink prices"}
{"text":"The prices were very reasonable, and the steaks were cooked just as advertised. All the orders were correct, unlike some of the other reviewers' experiences. Our server were very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent dinner last night at the Fiesta Mall Longhorn Steakhouse.  I rate the dinner so highly on the basis of both the meal and the service.  The restaurant was extremely busy with large parties the night of our visit, so we had a brief wait time before our waiter was able to take our drink order.  The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and gave us a free appetizer of chips and artichoke spinach dip as way of compensating for the delay.  The appetizer was delicious!  Shortly after delivery of the free appetizer, our waiter, Ray, came and introduced himself and took our drink order.  Our dinner order was taken upon delivery of our drinks.  From then on, the service was perfectly timed.  Our salads were delivered just after we finished the chips and dip.  Our grilled lamb chops were delivered only after we finished eating our salads.  We were given all the time we wanted to finish our wine after we finished our meals.  (I highly recommend the Joel Gott red wine.)  There was no rush to deliver the bill and get us out.  We were surrounded by patrons who were as happy and at home in the restaurant as we were.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying their food, and appreciating the friendly and efficient service.  Longhorn will be my neighborhood place to dine from now on."}
{"text":"Always have had good meals and steaks while at the restaurant. The take out is so bad."}
{"text":"Lets start with the positive. Food was excellent. Had the shrimp appetizer, salads, Bacon wrapped Sirloin, and Garlic Portabella Sirloin. Called ahead for seating, was told 20 minutes but was only maybe 5. Hostess was very pleasant.
 Now the negative. The server was BEYOND SLOW!! After being seated it was 10 minutes before he came to the table. Ordered our food the waiter left the table... Took another 10 minutes to get drinks.. Another 5-7 for bread... Another 10 before the appetizer. After eating that we sat.. and sat... and sat...and sat... Waiting for our salads. The manager brought out our salads, and offered me another soda( since mine was empty). After eating salads.. We waited... Again. FINALLY dinner arrived. Like I said before, very tasty. The server NEVER CHECKED BACK!! NOT ONCE!! My husbands steak was to be medium, it was medium rare. But he decided to just eat it so he would not have to wait. Needed boxes after dinner, the manager sent the waiter to our table to get our boxes. He stood at the table and looked at me and said \"yesss\"? This service was HORRIBLE!! Thank god the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the service was great.  Food was made to perfection.  From out of town and really was a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"1st time to a longhorn steakhouse.  We went for lunch but I went ahead and had a 12oz ribeye and upgraded my side to the maple spaghetti squash.  My wife did a lunch combo grilled chicken strawberry salad and french onion soup.  I'll start with hers, she said I t was excellent and would get it again.  We both enjoyed the warm bread.  Our server was very nice and got everything quickly.  My ribeye was good, not great the X server offered steak sauce and I probably should have taken it.  I ordered it medium and it came perfectly done but was not as tender as most ribeye steaks I've had this was closer to a top sirloin or low end choice. The spaghetti squash lacked any flavor and for the price should be bigger and as described.  If we go back I'll try the lunch combo my wife had."}
{"text":"C'mon now...the rating for this restaurant is just unfair.  I've taken my family to Longhorn several times in Arkansas and always look forward to returning every chance I'm in town.  We were passing through Arizona after a softball tournament and desperate for some decent food since we've been eating fast food for a week.  I searched Yelp to find something that we could enjoy.  I came across Longhorn and I was a little hesitant because our trip to Cracker Barrel wasn't quite as I'd imagined earlier in the week.  So what the heck, we gave Longhorn a try despite the reviews & low star rating.  I'm disappointed in what I read.   By far, this place deserves 5 stars.  It was clean, including the restrooms.  The service was amazing, just as we are used to by this establishment.  The food was very tasteful and servings were appropriate.  I couldn't ask for more.  Not to mention getting a really good filet minon cooked perfectly, loaded baked potato, & dinner salad for less than $25 was quite a steal.  For 4 of us and our bill was under $100.   It's hard to find a steakhouse that offers a complete meal without having to buy everything a la cart and racking up the bill.  All around experience was perfect!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and my feeling is the quality of the food here is going down day by day. Sorry to say that but it's true."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at bar. Actually a great steak with super service. Enjoyed. Wasn't too crowded and surprisingly quiet. Recommended."}
{"text":"The meal was good.  The usual, chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen."}
{"text":"Always good dood. Had a very rude pushy waitress the last time I was there. Love the margaritas,  definitely worth it. I'd go there just for the margaritas"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for some time but remembered it as family oriented restaurant with good quality food at reasonable prices, but not today. 
When we arrived we were told there would be about a 15 minute wait which was ok but we couldn't understand as there were several visible vacant tables. 
Our waitress was acceptable but my meal is another story. 
My order consisted of the following; onion petals for an appetizer, Longhorn salmon with rice, a Caesar salad and a loaded baked potato. Raspberry iced tea to drink. 
The onion petals were sparse and somewhat over cooked. I asked for some ketchup and after some wait received an empty container. The ice tea had very little ice in the glass and was warm. The Caesar salad was very saturated like it had been sitting out for some time and the croutons were soggy. The salmon had a very heavy taste like you would find in a lower quality fish and the rice was luke warm and tasteless. The loaded baked potato also was luke warm with a large scoop of sour cream and the balance of the ingredients would fill a teaspoon. 
It was my birthday and I received a hot fudge sundae which was excellent. 
We were there for almost two hours at dinner time on a Friday evening and we observed vacant tables during the entire time. Not what I remember on our last visit. 
Just maybe my experience is trending. Not sure when or if we will return...many many dining options in the area. 
Reasonable price is not an acceptable substitute for unsatisfactory quality."}
{"text":"I gave the restaurant only 1 star that is because I barely made it out of the place and home to get sick.  I had the salmon and not sure but I think it was bad.  I was feeling fine before I ate so I know it had to be something that I was served that got me sick.  Other than that I love the fact they chop the salads before they bring them to you and the staff was very friendly and also the place was clean.  If I would have just gotten the steak I would have been fine, everyone else I was with ate steaks and didn't get sick.  I'm not sure if I'll ever go back because I'll always remember the fish!"}
{"text":"Lovely calm dinning room with no TV's to spoil the ambiance. Delicious food. Hubs had the rib eye which was tender and juicy. I opted for the prime rib, fantastic. Flavorful and so yummy. Great choice of sides. Try the grilled corn on the cob. We will certainly return for more. Yum."}
{"text":"After waiting in the lobby for over 15 minutes a frazzled hostess came to take us to a table and then immediately changed us to another table in a dining room that was half empty. Our server, Reuben, was the only shining light of our 19th wedding anniversary celebration at Longhorn Steakhouse. My husbands hamburger took over 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen and was lukewarm when it made it to the table. There was food on the floor right next to our table the entire meal. The bathrooms were messy. No manager ever came by our table. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My best friend and I first came in a couple of months back, and were so excited to come back in because it was that good. Been here a few times after our first visit, and today I'm now compelled to write a Yelp review. It's Sunday evening, notably busy, however we were seated rather quickly. Took about 5 minutes to get our drink order taken, but no hard feelings because I understood it was busy and the server was most likely busy. We had ordered our food and drinks together due to the fact that we never change our order. I was really disappointed when the food took almost 40 minutes to arrive, alongside no drink refill. We get our steaks, and still no drink refill. No offer for more bread, even though 4 different servers and a manager were walking around. Halfway into eating we finally see our server and we have to ask for refills, on both drinks and bread. There's no reason for a server not to ask if you'd like a refill on tea if he's been by your table and sees it empty. Vincent I believe is his name. Totally unprofessional server. He seems to be about 30-40 years old. By that age you would think he'd know about common courtesy, and the way to treat his customers. But that isn't the case at all. I'm sitting here with half a steak left, manager came over and asked if everything was okay but took about 10 minutes to come back to the table and help. I was a server for 9 years and I know that customer service isn't that hard to handle. Even a simple smile goes a long way. Anyway, tonight was a fail. And I'm not sure we will be back...(unfortunate, but I'm not gonna pay $60 for half-way service)"}
{"text":"I will always give a place a second chance. This place will not get a 3rd from me. The second time was a terrible waste of money. First time the ribs were just flavorless blah ribs. The second time I wanted prime rib but they were out. I ordered a fillet and wanted it pink, not bloody. I dont know what the heck I got but it was some thin peice of overcooked yuck!. I even told the server Id rather have it under cooked because I could get an extra flash if needed. Cant undo overcooked. I wasnt going to wait for another while the rest of my party had their dinner. The other issues with that visit was very slow service even though there were literally only 4 other tables. The appetizer was very tasty but artificially fluffed with a whole bunch of lettuce for visual deception. Drinks were overpriced but thats the norm anymore or anywhere you go. But the absolute last thing with this visit was the ladies room was not stocked with ANY paper product!!!!!! My fault for not checking. Thank goodness we were on the way out. And as I was complaining about it to my daughter, one of the employees heard me and laughed! She was giggling about it! SERIOUSLY? NEVER AGAIN!  And Darden whines about poor sales.....I hope their CEO reads this."}
{"text":"Went here on New Years Eve. The staff was very friendly and on top of things for such a traditionally busy evening. We decided to eat at the bar, which is full service for dinner. Good food, good drinks, quick service. Nice evening overall."}
{"text":"Please take the lamb chops off your menu. 
They are incredibly bad in quality and do not fit for human consumption. 
The management needs to pay attention on their cleaning staffs . Bathrooms should not smell like urine . 
This is an old and tired place in more ways than one . Not good ."}
{"text":"I have tried this establishment twice  in last few months called ahead for a table and both times very disappointed  that this establishment represents Gaston County. I spoke to lady at hostess stand and  only excuses were made also we still were not able to sit together"}
{"text":"i like this place. good food. better after hours. can be pretty slow during lunch, especially if you have a large party and are looking to eat & get back to work in under an hour. 

i like the ambiance and the great salad selection (southern fried chicken salad w/ honey mustard-bacon dressing and warm cornbread croutons is one of the best i've ever had)."}
{"text":"Take note: This place does not accept reservations and wait times for dinner run an hour or more.

The staff, while nice, are completely overwhelmed. The layout of the dining area is definitely a contributor to this, as there are no logical paths for service.

That being said, the food is pretty good, if not overpriced. What's completely unacceptable is serving mules in tin cups to save money on copper ones. There's a logical reason for using copper. Tin is nowhere near the same. Also, this is a very loud restaurant when busy,"}
{"text":"I have yet to dine at this location but I did pay them a visit when they first opened since once again this restaurant is within walking distance of my apartment. I checked out the dine in and carry out menus and the prices are very reasonable. The Ambience is pretty nice......although it is bit dark even during the daytime. The hostess' seem very nice and the service is appears to be good as well. I will update this review very soon as I will be dining there over the next week or so.....until then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good prices, good service, but I am not so sure of a steak (porterhouse) that is swimming in butter. It was more grisly than I expected, but it tasted ok. I prefer good quality meat that doesn't need lots of butter to be flavorful or tender."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to go.  They have great servers, always attentive and I love their spicy ginger calamari!  Wish I could buy the sauce to take home!  I recommend this place 200%!"}
{"text":"Really good steak. Enjoyed the table side steak sauce immensely. 

Great service! Verified all sorts of ingredients to try and accommodate my dining companion's food allergies. 

I'd rank this somewhere between Outback and Fleming's."}
{"text":"The food was good. But it isn't really worth it. It's not fast service. It's not super cheap. The food is good at best. If it is near you, go right ahead. But it does everything ok. I got a burger and fries. Burger was good, but fries where bland. Now to talk about other people's foods. I can only go by other people's word and what I see. The brisket nachos looked pretty pathetic with almost no meat and mostly chips. And not much of that anyways, and they didn't look too good. The person eating them said they where ok in the high pitched voice, which usually means \"I'm trying to be nice.\" But the salad looked really good. I'm not even a salad person. But it looked good. And the person eating it said it was great. Also said the iced tea was really good. (Unsweetened.). So I don't want to bash this place but it's nothing to talk about. It's good. Not spectacular. But good enough."}
{"text":"I had the Garlic and Cheese steak with a butter and brown sugar sweet potato. I also had a nice garden salad with my meal. It was good the garlic was just a little overwhelming for me. The service was wonderful we never ran out for Ice Tea. The restroom was clean. Jacob was very patient and pleasant with us we while we were deciding what we wanted. There was absolutely no hesitation when we asked Jacob for extra dressing and gravy that was served with the steak. That was the first time I have eaten at Longhorn Steak House and I can't wait to enjoy another meal there. The only thing that really annoyed me was the people sitting behind us we overheard her like she was sitting with us at our table. (that was no fault of Longhorn)"}

{"text":"Fathers Day and we decided to go to Longhorn....
Normally I would throw myself around about going to a chain restaurant because they're typically substandard but I was a guest so I kept my yap shut!

Everyone got steaks...Comments about portions were mentioned, I didn't get a salad or app as I just wanted a burger and fries....(You know me...simple done right) Well I ordered a burger and steak fries and asked if they could throw an egg on it....
Nope...
Asked if they have avacodo...
Nope...
Okay fine...Throw some chili on my fries and we'll be good...Food comes out in a timely manner but dang...I got like 18 french fries with what looked like 3 tablespoons of pretty dry chili on...
The burger I ordered medium(asked med. rare but was advised against that due to meat quality...RED FLAG!!!)  Had 2 pieces of onion...Not slices,  4 slivers of very thin pickles and a sprig of lettuce and tomato...
Done medium well...DANG...I NEVER order my burgs mw...
Don't care! HUNGRY!!!!
Felt crappy the rest of the night...
Bluuugh......"}
{"text":"The staff was on point, we had a large group of eight dinning out last Friday.  The waitress moved quickly ensuring everyone had an enjoyable evening.  I had the parmesan encrusted mushroom sirloin steak, it was tender with wonderful flavor and properly cooked to requested medium well.  But, at the other end of the table my family member enjoyed a steak cooked to medium rare, a true sign your at a good steak house to me is the steak cooked the way you order it!!  YUMMY eats!!!"}
{"text":"I only give one star because our waiter was very nice and efficient. This was our third visit. Each time the food and drinks got worse and worse. The place was empty. We ordered Flo's steak and my husband had his with lobster. The steak was seasoned so much that we could hardly eat it! Very hot! The lobster was mushy with no flavor. It was the same when we last went. Even the Martini was not good! We just got \"Sorry\". Even after we told them we would never come back. On the other hand, our daughter was on a date next door at the Texas Roadhouse. She said the meat was far more superior to the Longhorns. So next time we will go there! Wake up! You were empty where next door there was a wait!"}
{"text":"This is my spot here. the Parmesan crusted chicken and the chicken bites be hittin on all cylinders!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great server. Our server woody was very accommodating and super friendly! Kept everything tidy and very attentive. Food came out right on time and was delicious. Soda was great, not that flat stuff some restaurants serve. Next time I want steak going to head back when I'm in Surprise."}
{"text":"The manager did contact me and asked that i contact him for the horrible service we received .. I contacted him twice and never heard another word from him.. and this was twice i had a problem with this restaurant"}
{"text":"We do not go to Longhorn often, but when we do, we are not disappointed. Friday night generally means a rather long wait, but we were sat within 10 minutes. Our server greeted us rather quickly and she was friendly. We ordered our drinks and then an appetizer when she came back with our beverages. Once our appetizer came out we were finally ready to order. 

Our food came out in a timely fashion and was cooked perfectly. It was all absolutely delicious! Our server checked in on us a few times, refilling our drinks and making sure we were satisfied. 

The kid's menu is great and the activity book is so much more extensive and interactive than other restaurants. 

We will be back, in due time. And I am certain we will enjoy our meal, as we always do!"}
{"text":"Poor attitude from the hostest and waiter. Asked for a booth and the hostess seemed to not like that request.  When we did get seated the table was dirty. 
When the waitress showed up she didn't know what beer they had on tap, even though the menu said to ask about it. Then it took 10min to even get the beer. 
When the food came out late, the steak was overcooked,  fries were overcooked,  vegetables were overcooked.  
Waitress seemed inconvenienced when asking for anything. She came to the table of a total of 3 times, and seemed like all she wanted was for us to hurry. 

I would suggest going to another place if you want good steak and friendly service that actually cared about serving you.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The legendary Ribeye was seasoned and cooked in a way where there was no need for additional seasoning or steak sauce, it was very very good.  The Texas Tonion appetizer was great, and the zesty dip was like a chipotle mayo based sauce which went great with it. The redrock grilled shrimp was super flavorful, and the loaded potato side went well with both the steak and the grilled shrimp. 

It wasnt too busy on a friday night, which just added to the laid back atmosphere where we just enjoyed the games on TV,  and the food."}
{"text":"It's a real mixed bag. I've had great food quickly but I've been seated then waited 15 minutes before a waitress came to our table and gotten all 3 courses cold. If it's a good night you'll get great mashed potatoes and steak, on a bad night it's medium rare an cold no matter how you order it. I will say that their corporate office responded quickly  to a survey we took and worked towards providing a positive dining experience."}
{"text":"Having only being open one day, I must say, that if they keep up the quality of service and food, this restaurant will put the other steakhouses in the Monroe area on notice. There was five people in our party for lunch on this Tuesday. There was potato soup, sirloin steaks, shrimp, prime rib sandwich, Caesar salad, and chicken eaten. There was no complaint from anyone. Service was flawless. By the way; the sirloin I had could almost be cut with a fork ! Seriously!
Yeah, I know, brand new and too many waiters and waitresses and who knows how many in the kitchen. All I can say is they put on a flawless performance. 
LongHorn had \"trainers\" from the Atlanta market area monitoring the local performance. I just hope that they can keep up the quality in months and years to come.
On the negative side, I found their prices to be a couple of dollars higher than other steakhouses in our area.
We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Search for something else. Close this page. Turn around now. Longhorn Steakhouse is not for you unless you like processed, overly salty, mediocre food. You ever do something you know you won't like but against your better judgement you do it anyway and then you're miserable? Well I am trying to save you from making the same mistake I did. 

I tried some of their appetizers and they were so gross I threw them away. I took my trash out tonight and I'm pretty sure if a raccoon got into the trash even it would be like \"nope\". So yeah, I'm not going to go into further detail. 

On the plus side the bartender was very personable when we picked up the order."}
{"text":"My family just got done eating at longhorn and we loved our server Lexie she takes all our orders without writing it down that's pretty impressive and our meals came out perfect too Lexie does her job very well  great job I hope your manager appreciate everything you do to make the guest feel like family when they eat there see you soon"}
{"text":"Been her twice and both times the service has been horrible. 
Our meal cost $200 for party of four. I expect the server to come back to the table once or twice to check on us or at least ask if we wanted a refill. All the food was cold no not even warm cold.  We got there at 6:00pm dinner ended at 8:20 but only because the four of us started doing the waive so the waiter would come back to the table. 
Work on your customer service skills!!"}
{"text":"Food is great here. Service on the other hand is less than desirable. I give it a solid 4 to 4.5 stars for the tasty juicy steak. Service? Two stars..... Maybe. 

Plan on spending an absurd amount of time flagging down staff to fill your glass, bring you bread, take your order, bring you the check, etc. Eating here is like working on the deck of an aircraft carrier. Always trying to flag someone down."}
{"text":"My date and I were going to go to BJ's Brewhouse but they were packed. We decided to go to Longhorn and it was great! The food was delicious, and we felt like we got tons of food for the price. Our waitress Michelle was absolutely fantastic and we really enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but so is the staff. They were so kind to me and very helpful too. I'd rate this place 10/10 if I could. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants !!  To eat at least once a month they have excellent servers always have a great attitude.. food is always on point I can't say enough good things about this restaurant... I'll keep coming back!!! they always have good service good servers with great attitude and my food is always the way I order it!!!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner, NY strips, salad and mashed potatoes! So delicious, two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Took about 45 min to be seated as they were very busy. It was completely worth the wait. Delicious steak. Great staff. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! We always get good service with the servers. Food is amazing always. We come here when we want to treat ourselves and indulge in yummy dishes swimming in carbs this particular location is pretty good."}
{"text":"Were from Prescott Valley,  looking for a bite before our son game in San Tan Valley.we had some time to kill. Excellence service. Waitress was great. We both order $12.99 steak meal. The steak was cooked to order for both of us. Delicious. Husband asked for manager and gave him kiddos to the chef.we will be back great steak house. Clean, great food. Great services and caring manager."}
{"text":"I usually don't write about chains unless I feel really strongly about it.

Let's start with the food:  It was Okay it didn't really blow me away by any means, but if you're itching for a steak this place will do just fine.

Here's where I can get nasty and I will try to be fair and cordial.  Service somewhat stinks.  They take reservations, but it's first come first serve.  I know they're not the only place guilty of such things, but get rid of it.  Just be honest and tell me you don't take reservations! (FU%$!)  Needless to say, we ended up waiting for about half an hour.  Sat down got our drinks and ordered.  Couple of our steaks were not done the right way....okay fair we had a large group.  

Finally, our checks were wrong -- we got someone else's ticket and we try to explain it to the waitress (she snarks back \"what's the problem!?\")  Granted, I've been a waiter before and some nights just suck, but keep your cool.  Always smile and tell them you'll fix it.  Apparently, we were in her way of doing her job.  In the end, we were all surprised and shock and couple of us had to speak to the manager.  

In the end, bad experience ruins the night and dinner.  Sorry LH Steakhouse you just didn't cut it this time!"}
{"text":"We tried long horn after passing it by for last 2 years. I only give it 2 stars and we won't be back. The food is okay, nothing to rave about by far. The service we had by our server was okay the service and friendliness of the rest of the staff, questionable. I noticed the manager on her walkie talkie interacting with staff the whole 2 hours we were there and never on e with any guests. We waited 30 mins to be seated, we waited 45 minutes for our food. My husband ordered the porter house medium and I ordered a flat iron medium well. They cooked his porter medium well and mine rare. I sent mine back because it was too undone for me, they sent me back a my flat iron re plated in a new plate but still undercooked. No one ever apologized for the wait or the undercooked steak. From years as a server experience, this was not acceptable standards and we both had stomach aches after"}
{"text":"2nd Chance and they fail...I actually like Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants but this one keep shooting itself in the foot.

Hits - pleasant bartender

Misses:
- poorly staffed bar, took too long to get a GOW (glass of wine) or the bartender's attention.

- I ordered the 11oz ribeye--medium, rice and green beans.  The steak was ver well done, no pink, I'm still chewing a piece right now, it was awful. The rice was the best thing on the plate and green bean came on a separate sauce plate--they didn't leave them in the microwave oven long enough. They were cold and awful. 

One of the 3 stars go to the manager for discounting my meal without me asking....I would have preferred a refund but nevertheless, I was pleased with that."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars!
We went to Longhorn Steakhouse last night for my son's 15th birthday.  He has been wanting to go there since it opened.  We were all excited to try it.  Unfortunately we didn't get to.  When we were seated my daughter noticed that one of the small plates we had just been given by the hostess was dirty...really dirty.  Upon further inspection we saw that all 5 plates that we were given upon being seated were dirty\". They were really dirty and one even looked like it had two small bugs on it.  Yuck!   We have owned a restaurant, so understand that sometimes things happen and a plate might not get completely clean, but all 5?  That's a big indication as to the cleanliness of the kitchen and if the dishes aren't clean what else isn't.  Needless to say, we didn't stay.  We didn't care how \"good\" the food was going to taste out of the peri dirty kitchen.  We went to Outback Steakhouse ( which was also a first for us) and it was delicious!  Happy birthday, Son\""}
{"text":"I usually avoid chain restaurants like the plague, but this LongHorn Location is above par and is definitely a solid choice if you're looking for a quick, decent meal at an affordable price. The steaks, while nothing to phone home about, are much better than your usual chain-food fare, and I always get good service here."}
{"text":"My parents and I took my brother here for his birthday dinner. All in all, our experience was mediocre and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. This was my first (and last) visit to any LongHorn steakhouse. The food was decent, but not the quality you expect from a good steakhouse. Our meal was certainly not worth the price we paid. If I'm spending $150+ on a meal, it better be daaang good. The restaurant was very noisy and the decorations looked tacky and cheap.

Our waitress was terrible, and I mean that in the nicest way. She wasn't personable or professional. She may have been new to the industry, or maybe she's just terrible. She sounded like a robot, reading a scripted message. We all ordered steaks and she repeated the same sentences with every order. \"Blah blah, medium rare is pink with a red center, blah blah. There are risks associated with ordering undercooked meat, blah blah.\" Yes, we know. We heard you the other three times. We have ordered steaks before.

My biggest frustration with the waitress was when we paid for the meal. We had two visa giftcards we wanted to use before charging the rest on my credit card. I handed her the three cards and explained it. She seemed to understand but... she ended up using one visa giftcard before charging my credit card for the remaining balance. When she came back to the table, she apologized for the error but didn't offer any solution. 

The highlight of the meal was dessert - the four of us ordered four different desserts (no judging, OK?!) and they were all very delicious. If I were to ever return here, I would strictly order dessert and leave as quickly as possible.

5 stars for dessert, 2 stars for food, 2 stars for ambiance, 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"We waited a month for things to calm down and decided to give it a try. What a disappointment. 

When we arrived, there was a 20 minute wait even though the restaurant was half empty. We were told they had a large party when the restaurant opened and the kitchen was backed up (based on other reviews they tell people this often). There were more people in the lobby than there was in the dining room. Reserved signs had been placed on the tables in the bar so people coudn't sit there either. For a new restaurant you would think they would be overstaffed until they figured out the correct staffing levels. Many people walked in and walked out because they were not going to wait for a table when the restaurant was half empty. There was a couple that asked for a manager, and it took so long for her to get there they had already left. That was the only time we saw her for the first half hour we were there. Didn't get her name, but she was very homely with dark hair.

The food was mediocre at best. Honestly, not worth the money. Since the kitchen was \"backed up\" I was afraid to order anything other than a burger for feart I would be there for hours. Lets just say the Fridays they tore down to build this place could do a burger better.  I would not even risk odering prime rib at this place. Pretty sure they would fuck it up.

The service was not any better. It wasn't bad, but they really need to do some training. In the middle of lunch we are asked if we want seperate checks. Apparentyly because we are two males having lunch we must want seperate checks, right? If you are going to ask that question, how about asking when you take the order or after they are done eating. I said one check, and heres my card. She took the card and was gone forever. She comes out with a tray of 10 drinks she is delivering and finally gets the check to the table. The service was not bad, it just was not good.

I truly fault the management. This place needs new management quikly to get this place in order. The manager that was there did not seem to know what she was doing or how to be an effective leader. It was priceless when she asked the couple next to us how everything was, and they basically said the service sucked and they would never be back. \"Well thank you for the feedback so I can look into this and make sure it doesn't happen again\". Very fake and insincere just like the other employees.

It was not a very relaxing experience listening to all the negative comments, complaints, disheveled employees and watching the failure of a manager they have. It was painful. We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"For the past three visit, I was very happy with the steak I had. Great flavor, just cooked well. 

I thought I would try something else. My salmon wasn't too bad but I couldn't feel the same way as I felt for steak. Should have stayed with the same steak I always ordered.

My daughter ordered kids meal cheeseburger, they used processed American cheese. I didn't think to ask before ordering, they exchanged it to a simple salad for her. 

This is a steak restaurant, their steak is awesome! But just steak."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and patient with you. Food has been fresh and cooked properly both times I have eaten here. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, every time we come here this service is great, the food is awesome, I and my  wife got a couple of steaks, a Bottle wine, only had a 15 minute wait not bad for popping at the last minute, this place is always doing good business, the meals are always generous portion,, salads are scrumptious, I can not say enough,, I recommend this place with the five-star."}
{"text":"I decided to try out the New Smoky Bacon Sirloin,  gave it an upgrade from a 6 ounce to an 8 ounce, a mixed green salad and an Idaho Loaded Baked Potato.
I had ordered the steak medium but it arrived a bit overcooked, well done but still surprisingly juicy so I shrugged and dug in. I was impressed,  nice flavor mix between the smoky bacon and tomatoe butter. The baked potatoe was good, the salad just the right size and the complimentary fresh bread quite good as well.
Taylor, my bartender was friendly, professional and well versed in the menu.
I drank a draft Devils Ale with the meal and enjoyed my fare thoroughly. 
For dessert, I decided on a Chipotle Peach Margherita. Awesome but strange! Loved the spicy sweet and salty flavors.
All and all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its cool and relaxing atmosphere as well as great cuts of beef and charming, professional staff.
The single fault I found was the overzealous cooking of my steak."}
{"text":"Was a bit salty. Thought it was a one off but when we told the manager he apologized and told us it was new policy to go back to the \"old way\" of seasoning, which he said is extra strong. There should be some warning.

Also the server was a bit slow. We would ask for something, and he would say he would get it. But then would walk out of the dining room for ten minutes before coming back with the condiment or drink we asked for. He did this a few times. In the mean time we are waiting with our fries getting cold or thirsty from the salty food.

This would be sorta understandable if the place was packed, but it wasn't. The manager even told us they were really light for dinner. We were seated right away when we got there. No wait. 

Verdict. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the customer service was awful. 
I understand you close at 10, however if I'm still eating with a big group it gives you no right to be rude. 
We asked an employee for a box, she walked away irritated to get it. Everyone felt awkward cause of the employees rude behavior."}
{"text":"This location recently opened up and I had received a gift card from one of my students at the end of last year.  Finally got to use it!

I honestly did not feel as if I was in Maryvale! It is very nice and I hope it stays that way.

Hostess and servers were very friendly.  We were informed of the different menus and given plenty of time to make our choices.

The honey wheat bread is absolutely delicious! We ordered one of the \"limited time only\" appetizers...brussel sprouts au gratin! Aside from the onions (I would have asked for no onions had I known), it was very tasty!

I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out perfectly! My baked potato was baked to perfection...fluffy and not over buttered or sour creamed!  I also asked for a caesar salad...one suggestion, ask for the dressing on the side! It comes very LIGHTLY dressed and needs more!  The dressing does lack a little bit of flavor, but if you add some of their freshly cracked pepper, it helps.

So, there's only one \"complaint\".  We were seated at a booth. The two managers (at least I think they were the managers as they were wearing dress shirts instead of the uniform worn by the rest of the staff), were standing against a wall right near our table.  Both my friend and I kept commenting to one another about how awkward and uncomfortable it felt to have them both just standing there as if they were watching us or guarding us...or something. The spot they were standing in was directly in front of the entrance to the restaurant, but still, it was just weird. Mostly because they were standing RIGHT in front of our table basically! It wasn't too busy at all, as we went in on a Wednesday night.  

Other than that, it was a tasty experience! We will be back but will ask not to be seated in a different location as to avoid having the \"secret service\" watching us and the door!"}
{"text":"Good food, but our server was not very good. We asked for 4 waters and brought 3. We were told we were getting appetizer plates, but they were forgotten. I had asked for a tortilla soup and literally 1 min later she said she would get my salad. Another person at our table had a problem with her forgetting her salad and another person did not get their side. I would understand if it was crowded, but she only had 3 tables... If you are kind and don't mind mistakes I would recommend this place, but if you are like me, I would stay far away."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite restaurant. We both do not like country music at all but this establishment more than makes up for this with it's incredible food and excellent service. Everything I have ordered here has been much better than I would anticipate and I always thoroughly enjoy my visits. I cannot wait until I dine there again."}
{"text":"If you want a perfectly prepared tasty steak for under $20 this is the place! Up charge $1.59 for the strawberry pecan salad to go with it....yum! A nice bonus was our server Jessie Veeeee....sit in her section if you can she was great!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife came here today to just reconnect, and have a relaxing dinner with great food, and we were not disappointed. My wife loves the Salmon here better then any other place. I had the 8oz Flo Filet, cooked to perfection. We started with the sampler appetizer, perfect, and of course, the best dinner salads you can get anywhere as well. Our server, Jordan M. was a delight. She was very personable, easy to talk to, made us feel right at home. This location is our favorite as well. Longhorn's knows how to cook a steak the way it should be. Used to go to the \"Keg\" just because my wife likes the Prime Rib.. As for steaks, they have no clue how to prepare , let alone, cook a steak. Thanks to your great Cook, your great server, Jordan, and thanks for another , very nice time at your restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give \"0\" stars, I would. Anyone who knows me would know that chain restaurants are not my thing. With that said, however, I do realize that they do have their place and serve their purpose for many people. Sometimes we want a \"decent\" meal, in maybe a little less time, at a lower cost, and maybe in a more casual atmosphere; electing to sacrifice quality for convenience if you will. I get it, and I think that's fair. There are many chain restaurants that I think hit the mark when it comes to this philosophy. Long Horn Steakhouse in Rocky River, Ohio, I'm afraid, does not. 

I stopped in on a Sunday night with my girlfriend. We had just finished some errands on this side of town and were both hungry, but neither of us really felt like going anywhere \"special,\" we just wanted to grab a quick bite of something maybe a step or two above a hamburger or a burrito. 

When we arrived, there was about a 15-20 minute wait. The hostess station and waiting area was nice enough. Time passes rather quickly and we were seated at a booth beside a party table situated in the center of this particular section of the dining room, where a birthday party of about 12-14 guests was just finishing up. 

The waiting for a table, and being seated is where any pleasantness during our visit came to an abrupt end. We sat in our booth for some time before being acknowledged by our server; a good five minutes or more. When he did arrive he asked if we would like something to drink, and offered some selections from the bar; the standard. We decided we would not be drinking this particular evening, and both just asked for water. He returned about 10 minutes later with our waters (seriously TEN MINUTES), and asked if we would like to order any appetizers. We don't topically order apps from these places, as most of them are fried or drenched in butter, but in this case, there was also some concern as to timing, as we have now been in the restaurant for nearly 40 minutes (including the 20 minute wait for the table), and so far have just received our waters. I declined any appetizers and asked if we could order our entrees. This seemed to annoy him to some degree. Thinking back, I thought he appeared somewhat annoyed when we order only water, but I didn't give it much thought at the time. 

Look, I don't know if this guy just didn't like me, or didn't like my girlfriend, or if he thought I was a jerk; whatever. I certainly didn't give him any reason, but it sure seemed that way, and quite frankly that's ok; not everyone is going to like everyone. The point is, under these circumstances, I shouldn't know it. 

We ordered our entrees and \"salads\" (don't get me started on those). When we were finished with it salads, I moved them to the end of the table, with the hope that they would be more easily spotted by our server, and so that he would know that we were finished. After not seeing him for another 10-15 minutes (I kid you not, no refill on water, or checking on the salad; nothing) he stops by the table grabs the two salad bowls and just continues walking towards the kitchen without missing a beat. He doesn't stop to see how we enjoyed the salads (we didn't enjoy them at all by the way), or ask if we would like more waters (both glasses were COMPLETELY empty; even the ice), or let us know how are entrees were coming along. It was truly unbelievable. Some of the absolute worst service I had ever encountered. 

After another 5 minutes or so (not so bad this time) our server returned with our entrees, a filet for her and a sirloin for me, with a side of Parmesan creamed spinach (which cost $1.99 extra because it's a \"Signature Side\" ). 

My steak was good enough for a sirloin, but the spinach was disgusting. It didn't even look appetizing. If it wasn't for my deteriorating relationship with our server that evening, I would say that I was surprised that anyone would leave the kitchen with that so and actually present it to a customer. 

As for my girlfriend's steak? It was cold. Cooked properly, but cold. Like cold, cold. I even tried it for myself. 

All-in-all this was an awful experience; one that will keep me from ever returning. I've had some so-so meals at this particular Longhorn in the past, and some questionable service there too, but this was off the charts. Especially in the service department. This is definitely a fool me twice, and shame on me."}
{"text":"Longhorn is part of the Darden chain and, as such, it should be good for a reliable 3-star review. But, tonight, that was far from the case. There were a number of issues and I'll try to detail each one

First, let's talk about the atmosphere. This location is \"open plan\", meaning that there isn't a wall between the bar area and the dining area. The lack of a wall was painfully apparent thanks to one gentleman in one group. This individual was speaking to the rest of the groups up at volume more appropriate for a loud, campus-style setting.  His Constitutional rights give him freedom of expression, but its well within my rights to not be subject to loud, racist, and homophobic comments.  I thought this was a family establishment.

Next, let's talk about the service, or lack thereof. We saw our server a total of five (5) times.  One of those was the typical drive-by to make sure the runner had delivered everything. Another one was to correct a glaring error on the bill. None of these visits managed to produce an offer of a refill on my beverage or even a glass of water.

Now, I'll attempt to describe the food. My wife ordered the Kobe steak melt.  Afterwards, she was of the opinion that it was little better than a cheese-steak sandwich from a run of the mill stand. I, on the other hand, was foolish enough to order a bacon cheeseburger.  A steak place should know how todo this, right?  Wrong. While visually appealing when served, the meat was undercooked from my routine order of 'medium' (the red juice on the plate should have given this away). The hidden, lower half of the bun had been mashed to the thickness of a saltine cracker as well as being soaking wet from said red juice. Inexplicably, there were slices of the same Kobe beef from my wife's sandwich on top. There was no space and very little seasoning resulting in one of the most flavorless burgers I have ever eaten. 

Finally, let's talk about Longhorn's points program. Several visits ago, there was a big pitch to sign up. At this point I believe this was just a ruse to collect my phone number and email address. I had hoped that the server's would ask about membership,s but they don't. And I typically forget to bring it up until after I've left. All I've gotten from this program is nagging email messages reminding me that my points are a lost to expire.  After this visit, I'm pretty sure they will."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and a lot to choose from on the menu. We will for sure be back. Standard steak house but better than outback and Texas Roadhouse I would recommend this as your first option."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a Black Angus or Outback. We got there at about 7:30PM, which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush. I could see several open tables, but was told that it was going to be a 25 minute wait. Normally I would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak and options in Surprise are limited.

Despite the open tables we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. After sitting down, we waited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread. Service was very slow.

Our server was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her, which is probably a management issue.

While waiting for our food I checked the restaurant out and it was very clean (I would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old). The only place that seemed to need some attention was the restroom. It looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.

When our food arrived it looked very appetizing. My wife order the filet mignon and I had the parmesan crusted chicken breast. We both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start. I thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.

The filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly. The chicken was good but I wish I had ordered the steak after tasting my wife's. The salad was fresh and the baked potato was good. In all the food was very good.

This places food is great, but the service isn't. If I'm going to shell out $90 for two dinners, one appetizer, and four adult beverages I would hope for much better service.

This could be a five star spot if not for the service."}
{"text":"ok..this is a new place...Darden Restaurant
It has a pleasant environment and a nice southwestern flair. The server we had was a tolal loss..spaced out guy. That was not a good start.
The food...meh...rainbow trout...pretty good. green beans prepared ok. 
Filet was small...Thin...baked potato was not thoroughly baked and \"loaded' ..??
not really...bread had no taste and the salad was over dressed...

This restaurant concept seems to be competing for business with \"Outback\" ..I think
Outback has them beat by a mile as their steaks , sides and service is much better.
sorry...cannot go back or recommend this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great food, and service. Our steak had so much flavor and the mashed pastries were amazing. Very comfortable atmosphere. They have a very nice wine list for you wine drinkers and many other specialty drinks. Highly recommend this local steakhouse!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I was pleasantly surprised.   We received a gift card that included Longhorn so we went.
First off  the restaurant is very clean.   And the decor is  understated western tastefully done.
We went on a Thursday evening and were seated right away.   Our server was efficient and pleasant   
Steak was done to order.  I had the Hawaiian salmon.  It was cooked perfectly, but the glaze was a bit too sweet for my taste.  We ordered a mushroom cheese appetizer  Very cheesy and hot (temp mot spicy)
I only gave Longhorn only 4 stars because of pricing   We had 2 lemonades, a steak dinner, a salmon dinner and 1 appetizer    Our bill was over $60"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience at this location! Lauren W gave great service, including menu recommendations, and made sure we had what we needed for a great meal. The food was prepared as ordered and the temperature was just right! I will be returning to this location."}
{"text":"You simply can't beat LongHorn for a fantastic steak dinner at a reasonable cost. Large appetizers, fresh salads, and of course the steak. My only gripe with this location is the service. The last waitress was rude during our drink order and eventually gave my table to another waitress so she could help the table behind us instead. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for business.  Food was reasonably priced and portion size was just right.  I ordered the special, 6 oz filet and lobster tail.  Delicious.   Staff was friendly and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Slow service.
Requests for water , bread, bread plates , butter, steak sauce were ignored. 
Food was meh 
We'll stick to Texas Roadhouse .
Sorry Longhorn, we tried to like you.  $150 for 4 ppl for dinner was a bit much for the crap service we got. Giving us 25% off and 2 $25 gift cards didnt make it ok since we don't plan on coming back....ever"}
{"text":"My wife and I love flo's fillet and loaded mashed potatoes, we come here as often as we can! The food is most of the time just the way we order it, there has been a couple times that were disappointing, the management staff had made it right every time so no real complaints, we enjoy the food and atmosphere the service is hit and miss but usually okay, we are always looking forward to coming back for the steak and loaded mashed potatoes lol it is very very tasty and satisfying, well worth the price tag! hope this review helps!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Thursday evening for dinner and we waited about 20 minutes. Décor inside is nice, similar to country log cabin. They do play a lot of country music too, which isn't my personal style but wasn't distracting. Our server was fine but nothing special. Some bread came out after ordering, which was perfect as we were pretty hungry. We did the 2 for $29.99, which was a choice of appetizer or dessert (we chose dessert) and 2 entrees. Entrée selection is limited on this deal but we both went for the Portobello garlic sirloin. Steaks were cooked perfectly and steaks tasted great. Baked potato was also good. We were REALLY full after dinner but still had a dessert to choose from. They were able to actually make the dessert a half size, as the full size could literally feed 3-4 people, and didn't even eat all of the half size dessert. The dessert was really good, very chocolatey. I definitely would come back here again, as this is a cheaper option to other steakhouses and can still get quality food."}
{"text":"We have stopped coming to this location because food became mediocre. Well we thought we would stop by to see if things have changed. 
We found still lots of good old specials on the menu but lots of new additions as well. Ribeye steak was so tender/well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Sides delicious and flavorful. 
I hope that this was not a fluke/ one time deal. 
Keep up the good work. Congrats to the chef."}
{"text":"Love their food! Too bad our waitress, Andrea wasn't working. Andrea is more attentive. Ribs were ok but the ribeye steak was so good! My husband and I split our lunch plates. I absolutely love the side salad with blue cheese. We are regulars here now."}
{"text":"We HAD to check this out the day it opened.  We were waiting patiently!!  The look of this restaurant inside is beautiful!!!  Has a really fun and open kind of feel- much brighter inside then the dull feel in Pineville location.  Everybody we encountered from the hostesses to servers were dressed in smiles and super nice.  I LOVE the fire chicken wraps but I was disappointed they no longer have wing sauce.  Tabasco won't cut it for this girl!!  Would have liked a little more time to chow on our salads before the entrees got to us but they were moving fast probably because they expected a large crowd.  It will definitely be on our go to list for dinner:)"}
{"text":"Always great service at this location."}
{"text":"We showed up for dinner on a Saturday, so, of course, we would have to wait for a table. The seating hostess told us that we would have to wait up to 30 minutes. Thankfully, the wait was only about 15 minutes, and we had seats to sit in until then. We were seated at a low table, which we liked, but it was near the bar, which we did not like. Nonetheless, we were able to mentally block out the crowds of people who were in the bar. The waitress was nice, took our order promptly, and brought out our food and drink refills at good times. The Flo Filets were cooked as we requested, and they tasted good. I was very surprised that my \"side\" salad was so large and cheap, and it was tasty. The price for the entire meal was not bad either, at least compared to fancy steakhouses."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites. I have been here probably dozens of times. I always order the filet mignon and the strawberry pecan salad. The steak is always cooked to my liking. I have had no negative experiences other than the occasional wait for a table."}
{"text":"I wanna give this place more stars. Servers are generally friendly and you get the feeling that management is chill, as well. I'd actually peg this place as middle of the road for chain restaurants. 

I probably would've given this place 3-4 stars before my last visit. Monday after the holiday weekend, so I understand that our server was busy. Ordered a surf and turf dish: steak and lobster mac. Lobster mac was terrible. It actually grosses me out just thinking about it. I removed it all from the shell and chopped it up to mix in with the mac, so maybe our server thought that I, at least, ate the lobster portion. However, I only had about 3 bites. Server never asked about it and, personally, I rate that as a failure on her part. That was a $ meal for it to suck. Steaks are usually okay, but had a lesser quality one this go-round, as well, so... I think I might run to the Acme and cook my own steak next time. 

Bread is a nice touch and usually have fresh salads and decent soups."}
{"text":"Never disappointing!  We have visited this location several times and have never been disappointed by the food or service. Service can be a little patchy, however never anything bad enough to warrant complaint. The food quality and quantity is excellent. Salads and steaks are  always perfect. The price is right! Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 STAR FOOD...BUT....After a great steak with friends in the restaurant we moved to the bar for an after dinner drink. What a disaster! The bar which had all but emptied after the rush was a total disaster. Food and glasses everywhere, with 2 bar tenders shooting the breeze. We ordered drinks....NO DISHES WERE REMOVED FROM INFRONT OF US. THE BAR WAS COVERED IN BITS OF FOOD. it was NOT wiped down during the 45 minutes  we were there nor was anything soiled removed. As for my chocolate martini. It was skimmed watery milk...bar tender admitted he ran out of chocolate and it tasted like a Virgin drink.....no vodka or any other liquor was apparent. 
RYAN THE MANAGER (we know him from a previous place of employment) appeared briefly behind the bar and did nothing to clean the bar area up. He certainly was too
 involved with counting receipts to see the disgusting plate of food infront of me for the entire time. 
Our local Paradise Valley Longhorn does a great job in the bar area. The chefs in both locations do a great job. Ryan needs to fire the bar staff who worked on Feb 25th 2017 and kick himself for doing a very poor job. Learned our lesson will only go to the Paradise Valley location in future!
Oh BTW our bar tender said he had never made a pomegranate Martini before and for sure hadn't a clue about a chocolate one!"}
{"text":"I'm as much of a snob about chain restaurants as everyone else, but I'll give them a try, and definitely have a few that I'm a fan of. This is one of them. I hadn't even heard of this place, so didn't know what to expect. We went for dinner on a Saturday night and expected it to be a long wait, but we were seated pretty much immediately, and the service was very good. The food was excellent, on par with Outback steakhouse for flavor and price. We spent around $60-ish dollars on a dinner for two. I would go back, but it's a little pricey for our weekly meal out. 

Also, this isn't important to most people, but for a chain, I thought this place was decorated very cute with cowboy boots, bridles, etc. on the walls. There is a TV in the bar, but the place isn't loaded with annoying tvs, which I hate."}
{"text":"For a chain steakhouse, I think this place is pretty good!  I am not a big red meat eater, but I enjoy a good steak every once and a while.  I have never been to a big fancy steakhouse so my review may not be the best one to go by, but I enjoyed myself!

When we first arrived, we were told it would be a 45-50 minute wait...it was Valentine's Day weekend, so that was expected.  However, 15 minutes later we were seated and giving our drink orders!  

I got an 8 oz sirloin, cooked medium rare, with mashed potatoes and let me just say, it did not disappoint!  The steak was full of flavor and was cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were delish (I love potatoes)...and our appetizer of shrimp and lobster dip was pretty tasty too! 

I will definitely be going back.  It is an affordable steakhouse, where I have consistently had stellar service and awesome food."}
{"text":"We went to this location on Friday evening and did call ahead seating. When we got there the place was absolutely packed, I don't think I've ever seen it so busy before. We were seated right away thanks to the call ahead seating option (which is very user friendly online.) Our server was new but extremely pleasant and accommodating. Since it was taking a while for our appetizer to get to our table the manager actually came out and spoke with us offering us our appetizer on the house. I didn't even think that it was taking a long time considering how busy it was. The manager was extremely nice and did more than she needed to. Other than that our food was cooked perfectly and we were extremely satisfied. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11am (open) and did not see any food on the table until 12:20. Food was mostly so-so, a couple of the steaks were more like chewing on a dish rag. The difference between medium and medium-well is completely lost on their kitchen. Ordered a orange creamsicle drink that somehow tasted like vinegar and sent that back. We had 3 flys join us for lunch, and yes I counted, not much else to do waiting for the food. When it came time for the bill I watched the waitress try to figure the bill out for another 10 minutes. She had wrong people on the wrong checks, then time for another round of wrong items on wrong checks. We will not be going back, the price was not worth the poor experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Not a bad word to say about this place. My ribeye melted in my mouth, everything was so delicious! To top it off, great service! Jim did an excellent job taking care of us. He is the bartender and his drinks were also very good! Highly recommend! Next time I come to Arizona, you'll be seeing me!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, subpar food. Our waiter was very oblivious to our needs and the food all tasted burnt."}
{"text":"I continue to go to Longhorn. I haven't had a horrible experience. We went last night and I tried something different.... Great Burger and awesome service. Ryan was our server and even though they were busy he made sure we were taken care of. Great customer service and great food."}
{"text":"Lucky lucky me! And it's nice to have some of my Karma coming back to me! 

I decided to try out the Longhorn Steakhouse Saturday night.  I thought it was a new location of a different restaurant of a similar name on Southern that had closed, but when I got there I discovered this was a brand new restaurant that hadn't even opened yet. The parking lot was full but when I got the to the front door I was told by the two people holding menus that this was a training night and not open to the public. I made a joke that it was too bad I couldn't be a trainee for the evening and went to leave when  they asked, Is it just you? and I said Yup, just me, so they handed me a menu and said you can go on in and sit in the bar area. The meal will be complimentary and we hope you enjoy your dinner. 

After I picked my jaw up off the floor I walked in and was seated at the bar by a very nice hostess and an even nicer bartender named Jen came up to me and started explaining that I could order any meal on the menu, that it included either an appetizer or dessert, my choice, and she started describing the drinks to me. I thought the folks in front said drinks were included but I did get charged for the Margarita at the end, but that was okay because it was delicious and what was in the shaker filled the class twice so it was well worth it. I looked over the menu and couldn't believe what I was seeing. So many good choices! I asked if the combinations were included and she said yes, anything on the menu. I was thinking about getting the prime rib but she said they had run out of that because they only made a certain amount and the training had been going on all day

Still not believing my good luck I ordered the Filet and Lobster dinner, which would have been $26.99 any other night. The dinner came with a choice of dinner salad or Caesar, and I chose Caesar, a choice of side dishes and I chose fresh vegetables, and honey wheat bread with butter. The bread was fantastic, the Caesar salad was crisp and fresh.  The steak arrived before the lobster, one of the glitches they were working out in training. I took a bite of the steak which was melt in your mouth tender. I held off on eating more so I could include the lobster in my photo.  See my pictures. The filet had a wonderful grilled flavor and was cooked just right, medium rare. It did have a grisly  place on one side.  The lobster was very moist and juicy with excellent flavor and I savored every bite of both. The vegetables might have been a little overcooked, at least for my taste.  I would've expected them to be a little crisper, but they had good flavor.  

I ate all the lobster but had a little piece of steak left over and decided to take my dessert in a to-go box to eat later.   I finished up my Margarita, had a nice conversation with Jen, and even the manager, Anthony, came over to ask if everything was fine.  From him I learned this is the first Longhorn location in Arizona, although they have others that will open soon in the Phoenix area.   San Diego, where I live, is SOL for the time being.   Our loss.

Oh, and the Key Lime Pie, which I ate later, was one of the best I ever tasted!

Aside from being complimentary, I would have gladly paid the price for this wonderful meal. I hereby give this restaurant the Mother Yelper stamp of approval and hope to get back here soon.  Bon Appetit!

Epilogue:  I went back on the official opening day, Tues, Dec. 11th, for lunch, and one other time before I left town.  The food was just as good both times."}
{"text":"So very disappointed in my visit to this restaurant. We sat and waited for a table for over 30 min and the service was just a slow once we sat down."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! For the third time in a row the service was so awful we have decided not to go back to this restaurant. Not only did we have to get our own silverware after 15 minutes of staring at our bread, it took them 25 minutes to get us our sandwiches and over 30 for the soup. The food was pretty tasty but our server was dingy, unapologetic and fake. Never again."}
{"text":"I live going in with the girls for the lunch combo and margarita specials :) The jalapeño poppers are delicious!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib was perfection. Can't get enough of thier apple butter. Bartenders can make a good dirty gin martini..and believe me that is rare at corporate restaurants. Wish they had regular onion rings but other than that, wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Tried here once on a whim because we wanted to eat early and most steak places are not open before 4pm and I am so glad we did. We have returned every week since. Each time the filet is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, juicy & tender. Mixed vegetables prepared the way I like them. Can't go wrong with any appetizer and we've tried many of them and all delicious! Then there's dessert....we've only tried the jar deserts which are a perfect size after a filling meal. And each time we've had the same server Joanne S. This last time we actually requested to be seated in her section because she is friendly, accommodating and hasn't got our order wrong even tho we make changes. For the price and service, you won't find a better place for a great meal out! Oh yeah, can't forget the warm wheat bread to start! Yum!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. One of my favorites. Lunch specials are great, food is fresh and cooked well. My only complaint is that they won't do burgers rare. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"What a great different place that I have not been to for a long time.  Really enjoyed the ribeye as well as the flavored sweet tea.  Baked potato was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"This is your typical steakhouse chain located on the Rockside Road/Independence restaurant row.  Variety of appetizers, some seasonal.  Variety of steaks, covered with various toppings.  The steaks were well prepared and seasoned.  Service was attentive.  Drink selection is good, but a bit pricey.  OK place to go for a steak dinner."}
{"text":"So it's part of a national steakhouse chain, and I was not expecting much.  The menu was solid, with interesting appetizers.  The steak selection was good.  Food was well prepared.  The steak was well prepared, but the topping (lobster) was a bit lacking.  Service was solid.  Overall, solid, but not outstanding experience."}
{"text":"We came in Monday night, Natayle gave us great service she was very nice and polite. Natayle mentioned they had their best chef in the house and for being a chain steak house my husband and I were impressed. My lobster and steak were a good size, cooked and seasoned perfectly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I am very impressed over this Restaurant.  First of all when I watched the server take paper towels and a disinfectant spray to clean the tables, I remembered all other restaurants using the same dirty rag on every table. Then the extra friendly service from the hostess to the server Tara M.  She was the best. Then the food came. Yummy all the way.  We had the Blue Cheese Wedge salad and shared a prime time burger. The best burger we ever had.  
Thank you for a great experience.  I recommend this Restaurant 100%..!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! 
Got to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!
After waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \"two of us, but is there a wait??\" She responds, \"yes at least 10-15 minutes\".
At this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. 

Needless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."}
{"text":"My friend and I were here last night, and it was a pretty good experience. Jani was our waitress, and she was great. 

We started out with the spicy shrimp appetizer, which was ok. It wasn't hot, just lukewarm. 

My friend had a burger and fries and had no complaints other than everything being cold, and I had a rare 8-oz steak and broccoli. Everything was good, but lukewarm (I understand the steak being lukewarm due to how it was cooked). 

We also had the chocolate stampede for dessert, which is particularly good but also very heavy. It's more like a six-person dessert, not just for two.

The reason for four stars and not five is that I was charged for the wrong steak (I was charged for 11 ounces, not 8) and that our food wasn't hot. I didn't want to sit there another 15 minutes waiting for them to fix the bill, so I just paid the extra and went on my way. We both had gift cards; otherwise, this place would be too expensive for my taste. Especially when all the food wasn't hot enough."}
{"text":"Katerina You Are Amazing!!  

Thank you so much for attending to our needs.  

For some reason, our steaks were Super Salty, and were ruined. We were at LH to celebrate and it was Very disappointing, however, you made the whole situation Right!  

You were courteous and empathetic and we appreciate you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location of Longhorn's for many years and I am a fan.  My most recent visit was on New Years Eve and our waiter was in very good spirits even though he had a lot of tables to take care of. We were seated right away and our waiter had a great sense of humor.  My top two recommendations at Longhorn's are the wild west shrimp and the chicken tenders. 

The wild west shrimp is amazing with a hint of spiciness and very flavorful.  The chicken tenders are hand breaded and some of the most flavorful chicken tenders you will ever get at a restaurant. If you're in the mood for a salad their honey mustard dressing is amazing. 

Also always a plus you get fresh baked bread and butter when you sit down."}
{"text":"Consistency is what I like about Long Horn. Still the best place for a steak under $25 anywhere. Even their sirloins are great and you can mostly cut with a fork. The Filets you can always cut with a fork.  A dash of salt and pepper is all I ever need to put on their steaks.

The salads at Long Horn, this is where they need to step up their game. Let's do something other than ice berg lettuce guys!"}
{"text":"This just might be the best steak for the buck.

Ordered the basic sirloin. Very tasty. Tender, juicy, maybe a bit on the salty side. Cooked to perfection. One of the best sirloins I've ever had.

Deep Fried Wisconsin Cheese curds was a tasty treat to start the night.

Good service. Friendly. Fast. Not too informal.

I'll be hitting up this place as often as I need a good steak at a great price in a nice atmosphere  with great service."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse. Yep, the best. No, its not a $100-a-plate joint, its a middle America steakhouse.

As I wasn't too hungry, I got the lowly sirloin, something I usually avoid as a poor quality steak. But the Longhorns sirloin exceed many a New York strip.

Came back next time and got the Strip - even better than the sirloin. The quality was no fluke. Now I'm sure steak snobs will look down on these steaks as over seasoend with too much added butter. But for me, i just want a great tastling steak and this is it.

I also had a bowl of the potato soup - I love it!

Apple pie dessert is nutty and good. Better than average and my wife had the chocolate lava something and she was raving about it for days. 

Service is fine. Not spectacular, but they get the job done professionally and pleasatly. 

Decor is middle America steakhouse - something I prefer to New York City white tuxedo. Give me clean, solid middle class over preeening pretension."}
{"text":"I went here on the 2nd of march, which by the way was my bday... the service was magnificent and the food was even better. My girlfriend and I were both amazed at the service and food. We left a friendly tip, after our great fest! Must go back again!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on going to chain restaurants, but we were staying nearby and didn't want to drive far for dinner. This was 6 minutes from our hotel.

The restaurant is on the out parcel of the large mall, with it's own parking area.

We were immediately seated and attended to. Service was efficient and friendly.

We were able to special order just spring greens instead of the mixed salad they normally provide. Big plus for accommodation!!

Food was also pretty decent, and well prepared.

Overall, we were pleasantly surprised, and would consider another location when on the road."}
{"text":"At the start of every year, hubby and I do a detox of some kind, as a way of rebooting our system from toxins and heavy eating.  We usually have a version of Fat Tuesday before we start the diet.  This year our Fat Tuesday happened at LongHorn.

This was my husband's first time to LongHorn, my second.  My first visit was with friends while hubby was out of town, and we sat in the bar eating appetizers.  I remember ordering a blackberry mojito back then and being disappointed.  But, the service was excellent and both times our meals were hearty and well-prepared.  I married an Argentine, so meat is his business.  I know when his steak is perfect because he can't speak.  LongHorn left him speechless.

We started our meal with the shrimp & lobster dip (warning: you will want to devour this, but try to enjoy it slowly because it will be gone so fast and it is so good!), then shared plates of tender filet and baby back ribs, with baked potatoes on the side.

LongHorn is a nice dining option close to home, and the perfect place to ruin a diet or encourage a new one."}
{"text":"What happened here? Been to various Longhorn's and always excellent food and great service to include this particular location 3 times. To start, the waiter seemed very distracted. Messed up the drink order adding lemon to my tea then serving my tea to wife and me her drink...easy fix. Then he brought me a Caesar salad when we discussed the different dressings on a house salad and agreed on a Balsamic ... clearly not on a Caesar. Again no problem, just ate that one instead. Then our drinks ran dry for over 15 mins and were empty when the frumpy grossly overweight manager came buy to check in on us...\"all's well here\" I said jokingly staring at our empty glasses...\"OK enjoy\" as he scurried off to resume chatting with the young waitresses. 45 mins later our food came and was acceptable...but had to ask twice for ketchup for my somewhat warm fries....This place was far from busy (so thats not an excuse), but they seem to have lost sight of basic customer service. I would bet that there is a new manager there recently as they all seem to be elsewhere...which is where I will be taking my business from now on. It was fun while it lasted...good luck!"}
{"text":"LongHorn steakhouse is a staple chain that's always been very good at service, and their food.

I recently went during a rush hour on Saturday. I recommend calling ahead to get on the list beforehand, it is VERY helpful.

All the waiters are very knowledgeable and very delightful to deal with. The only complaint I have is that they DROWN all their courses in their respective sauces. Always ask for it on the side!"}
{"text":"First time at this steakhouse and we live around the corner. Not bad. The sirloin was cooked perfectly, but the meat was a bit tough to chew.  My fiancé said her sand which was ok, but wished there was more flavor. We both ate our food and it was ok. However our server Nicole was awesome. Personable, knowledgeable, quick, outstanding service all-around. Bravo Nicole. We will come back here because of your service. I would hire you at my restaurant but I have a feeling you're a top-dog here. Great work."}
{"text":"Short: go elsewhere. It is much worse than you think it is 

Long:

Booths are terribly hard every two seats or so.

We were a 7 top, they got ONE order correct

Waitress was rude and forgot a beer

The steaks were overcooked, no pink in my medium steak

Honestly, most of my meal was going home for my dog but I'm fairly certain he won't eat it so I'm not boxing it.

You know when you get really drunk and even in your beer googles you know this person is FAR FAR below your drunk standards and you're putting yourself in serious risk of herpes? This is longhorns."}
{"text":"Called ahead took us right to our table when we arrived  I get the porterhouse all the time , great tasting done the way I like it, bread is delicious! Staff good , place is always busy"}
{"text":"I went to this longhorn yesterday and I didn't check in because I called in an order to go. I love longhorn but this was my first take out order. I was so hungry and when I got home I was so disappointed. My bake potato was over cooked it was brown on the inside, my steak I ordered well done but it was burned up. I always order when I eat inside well done and it is normally perfect. I just feel like they just threw it in a bag and sent me out the door! I would have took it back but was raining so hard I didn't want to go back out!"}
{"text":"We went here for my dad's birthday, the food was good and the portions were kinda big. The steak I food I ordered was good even though it was long wait which, is understandable considering it was the weekend. The waiter we had was friendly and so was the hostess. The dessert was also good as well."}
{"text":"my 20 oz porterhouse steak was like eating bad old beef jerky!   buy your self a barque and a steak at walmart, and you get more for your money. then go to youtube on, how to cook a good steak.  service was the best, very hardworking and caring people, the decor was beautiful, the restaurant very clean."}
{"text":"Love this place - best chain restaurant around - Red rock shrimp - asparagus and a Malbec"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at this location in February of this year. We were celebrating a special occasion.  The steakhouse was extremely busy at the time we went. However, we did not have to wait long before we were seated in a booth. 
We had a wonderful waiter. He is working two jobs: one as a waiter and another job at Dunn-Edwards Paint Store. He also is a full-time college student in the medical field. He was one of the best waiters we have ever had. He was attentive, knowledgeable about the food items on the menu and the specials offered. He always returned to check on us and refill our ice tea. He provided excellent customer service. 
Our porterhouse steak we ordered was cooked to perfection and the sides were fresh and hot. The salads were crispy and the salad dressing was not overdone on the salads. Even their ice tea tasted good, it wasn't watery as it is in some places we have dined. The ambience is upbeat and busy. I really like this location and definitely will return in the near future."}
{"text":"We stopped here last minute around 8:30pm.  Denise was our server and I can't say enough positive things.  She was attentive, helpful, knowledgeable of the menu, and grateful.  My boyfriend and I have recently chosen to sit at dining tables instead of at the bar due to the lack of guest service we tend to typically receive as of late, and with this being the first time in a while it was completely worth it! Not to say the bar would not have been awesome because the drinks were great at as well but I'm glad we sat with Denise tonight.  I manage a restaurant and have been in the industry for 15+ years... and she is memorable. 
We had the prime rib, mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushroom appetizer, salmon, and broccoli.  Everything was perfect.  Not one complaint."}
{"text":"Brand new location at the Metro Mall, open about 2 weeks at this point. It was a Saturday night and about 45 minute wait for table with 7pm arrival. Bar ran out of Coors light after the first round no big deal they were quite busy understandable. Service was painfully slow. The server was new to the industry unable to answer questions and didn't understand many. Unable to make recommendations as she does not eat meat. No  big deal as we are meat eaters. Ordered Stuffed mushroom appetizer and they had a \"funny\" taste. I want to say \"unwashed\" mushroom taste but couldn't really pinpoint what was off. Ordered my NY strip with a few add on's Merlot Mushrooms and blue cheese, she had to ask twice what I meant by the order first at the table thinking that it was my side item choice and then seemed to understand when I showed her on the printed menu. Came back a second time from the kitchen for futher clarification???. 4 people total in the party and we were served the main course 1.5 hours from placing the order. We sat for quite some time at the empty table while groups of managers and trainers (?) walked by never stopping to ask how things were going or why we might be waiting so long for our food. Dinner finally arrives and none of us were feeling very hungry after filling up on bread, appetizer and dinner salad but we were excited to try our meals. My NY strip was covered in blue cheese sauce and one large portobello mushroom. I had been expecting \"mushrooms\" not a large single slice but perhaps I misinterpreted the menu? I had requested medium well expected pink center, it was more well and no medium. The fat had not been trimmed from the cut which I have never experienced with NY Strip but I am capable of cutting the fat :) I was expecting the meat to be quite juicy and tender given the amount of fat left in place...unfortunately it was very tough and chewy.  One of the worst steaks I've had in a restaurant quite frankly. Ordered a dessert to go as we didn't want to wait any longer it was lost in translation though because it took 3 tries to split the bill between 2 couples. Overall very disappointing and definitely not worth the $100 bill :( Normally we visit the Keg or Firebirds for steak dinner, we knew this wasn't exactly the same caliber but didn't expect it to be so bad. I know that they are new and working out the kinks in service but there really isn't an excuse for bad food. Also with all of those managers hanging around you'd think one would be assigned to checking customer satisfaction at each table."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday dinner and was hankering for some ribs-to my luck they were sold out. I am an avid outback fan, but after having LongHorn's filet, I can't lie, it was DELICIOUS and waaayyy better and bigger than Outback. I ordered the special salad with grilled watermeleon and kale, wasn't that good and only gave you a tiny piece of watermeleon. Other than that, the service and staff was great!"}
{"text":"Shocked to find out that they got rid of their happy hour. Per bartender, this happened about four months ago.  I thought i was there during that time.  :("}
{"text":"The atmosphere was beautiful. Our waiter was not bad but the food was horrible. Their wings were terrible, the Mexican looked like they plucked it and served with spices. I think they should stick to steaks."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  We were greeted by a hostess that looked scared out her mind.  When the manager stopped by the hostess station, I could see why.  She never made eye contact, smiled or even greeted us.  She just barked at the hostess a table number and to seat us.  She had the same look as my ex husbands angry German grandmother.   All of the employees were rushing around with the same scared cat look.  On to the food.  I ordered a sirloin, cooked medium, a caesar salad, a side of baby back ribs, and their version of elote.  My steak was well done and the ribs looked like they were from a charred rabbit.  The corn on the cob was almost raw, and had a smear of tasteless cream and cheese.  The salad was just okay.  At the end of the meal, even though I was with my boyfriend as a party of two, our server asked if we wanted two checks.  Wtf?"}
{"text":"Service is good here is why i gave two Stars but the food is just ok... My steak tasted Like it was boiled..if you like places like Texas road house this is not the place for you-you will be disappointed"}
{"text":"I totally agree with the reviewers who had something to say about the service. It's pretty subpar but there are some nice servers that work at this location.

The food is always good though! I love to get the spicy little shrimp appetizer with a side caesar salad. The chicken tenders are really good as well & you get a larger portion. The chopped steak topped with mushrooms & fried onions with a side of mashed potatoes is my new favorite dish. 

I think this location is best if you want to get your food to go or to eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Had a great date nite with the wife. Flo's filets all round.Been to this location many to.we and have always had great food. Service is all ways so so. But we go their for the food.."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVES but the steak (from a steakhouse) was way overcooked - i asked for medium rare they gave well done it was like beef jerky when i asked for them to return it to the kitchen out amazing waitress did right away and apologized for the mistake 
got the second one 
same #@$@#$ thing 
the poor waitress said she will make sure the next one will be perfect
20 min later it came out 
rest of my group was done eating desert!!!!
i told her it was not her fault 
there was no apology from management or kitchen staff... 
beer was cold tho 
probably only reason i stayed"}
{"text":"Family was in town and decided to treat them to a nice fancy dinner. Place was very nice. Our waitress's name was Elizabeth and her customer service was very exceptional. I wouldn't mind having her as my waitress in the future. 

Now, the food. I had me a nice sirloin (Medium) with corn that was served mexican style with the grated cheese, slight mayor, and hot sauce. Corn was very VERY TASTY. Also, had to order a lobster tail with it. SURF AND TURF!! The sirloin was moist and juicy. The lobster tail, man words don't do it justice. Moist and delicious with every single bite. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My close friends and family know that the biggest craving I have is a good steak. Now, to be fair my husband is an amazing cook, so there are big shoes to fill when it comes to steak, so I am taking that into consideration during this review. Twice I've been to LongHorn and I am in complete wonderment how a restaurant who's genre is American Steakhouse is anything but American.  First I'll start off with my French Onion Soup (ok French, not American) on two different occasions, in fact two different years, the onions were semi-crunchy.. I don't have to say anything more about that.. just not my cup of soup (pun intended).  
Second- my daughter and I ordered a filet (a girl after my own heart).  When it arrived, it was butterflied.  She didn't  know any better (bless her heart) but I was confused.  My medium rareness never stood a chance.  It just wasn't pretty and I'll steak my reputation on that:).  The service was fast.. too fast, like 'round up the cattle and get 'em out ' fast. I guess that can be a good thing when your heartburn kicks in after eating their French Onion soup, but I prefer to eat out at a slower pace."}
{"text":"We are not from the area but wanted something besides a drive through and decided to stop here for a late lunch. My family ordered 2 Renegades, the Chopped Steak and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The food was excellent and my steak came out perfect! When I order medium well plus, it always comes out medium or burnt and I have to send it back at least once. I wish we lived closer because a 9 he drive to come back isn't quite feasible."}
{"text":"This is a fairly regular lunch spot for me.  They have great service and happy faces on their staff.  The food is above average and some dishes are very good.  Today I had a new salad.  It was made with fresh, crisp, whole romaine lettuce leaves, crispy smoked bacon, tart blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing.  I had them add grilled chicken.  It was very satisfying and was served quickly.  If you are looking for a quick lunch, quality food at an affordable price I recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"I was in town staying at a hotel for work. I stopped in to pick up dinner and the food was very good and was out in a reasonable amount of time. Hostess was pleasant and prompt to assist. She took my order and escorted me to the bar to another pleasant employee who provided a much needed beverage. I orderd the baby back ribs and they were great. I recommend."}
{"text":"I got a gift card for longhorn for my bday so I had $30 to eat. My fiancé and I also had a coupon for a free Appetizer. We got the lobster and shrimp dip which was Awesome. For our main course we both got a Signature stuff steak he got a lobster stuff steak and I got the loaded potatoes stuff steak. Our meals were great. The only problem that we had was our waitress took 20 mins to get us our check after we were finish eating and then another 10 to get our change."}
{"text":"Where to start...
 The amount of salt and butter on the food was so over whelming that myself and my date didn't like the steak or the shrimp. BTW I asked for the grilled 500 calories shrimp and was brought out shrimp on rice drenched in this salty buttery sauce. Our waitress was pretty confused ever time she approached the table so I can only guess she put in the wrong food.

The service and the food were all pretty bad. I've been to other Longhorns and it was nothing like this. Don't get me wrong this isn't a \"fine dining \" steak house but if their going to say steak house in their name they'd better be able to at least get the steak right. 

We will try it again next year, if their still here."}
{"text":"Great Surf & Turf, ribeye & lobster. The desserts are fantastic,  another reason to eat here!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good bread. Meals come out hot. Great mashed potatoes.  Steaks are good not great.  It would be nice that a steakhouse would have a real steak house manager.  They do their best. Not great but good"}
{"text":"By far \"THE BEST \" customer service that I have had in a restaurant In a long time. The food was FANTASTIC and the drinks were OUTSTANDING!!
I'm a real critic of anyplace I patron. This place was GREAT. 
The manager sat with us for a little bit and said she regrettably didn't keep my beer of choice in stock but made my wife and I feel so comfortable doing it And to me I think it's just the effort she put forward that made me appreciate it more.  
The wait staff was very attentive to us and the bar staff was on top of their game. Definitely recommend this place. And most definitely will be returning. 

You guys are doing a great job keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else.  Got seated right away.  Waited 40 minutes for our salads to come out.  2 minutes later our main entrees and then the APPETIZER.  Everyone's steaks were overlooked.  Won't ever go back again."}
{"text":"Was driving around town looking for a place to eat.   Landed here because we finally got hungry.

Service was excellent

I had a rib eye steak...the smaller one as I had to get up early the next morning and travel.  It was actually a pretty decent steak.

Dessert menu looked good, but I wanted a dipped cone, so..."}
{"text":"Have had some good meals here.  Today's lunch was ridiculous, and confirms my opinion from my previous visit, that this place is going down hill.  Service is always there, but sort of strangely reluctant, like they really are not happy you are there, and wish they didn't have to serve you.  My meal started out with the semi-stale meh bread they dropped down.  I ordered the \"Napa Chicken\", as the prices for steaks just seemed even higher than last visit.  The dish was described as grilled chicken with mushrooms and artichoke hearts in a light butter sauce.  After what seemed like a really long wait, as there were no more than three active tables, my so called meal arrived.  My Napa Chicken that was dumped off, consisted of two one ounce chicken tenders, one mushroom the size of a quarter cut in half, and two quarters of canned artichoke heart, with a butter glaze that was barely visible on the plate. 
Our servers solution was to give me 25% off my entree, and he said \"There are supposed to be three tenders.\"  There was no offer to bring the additional tender, and when I asked what the kitchen or manager said was going on, the server said he had not told anyone, and I doubt he cared enough to ever tell any staff. I left the place hungry, after dropping over $18 for a lunch entree, iced tea and tip.  What a joke.  It really pissed me off, and started my day out on a bad note.  I will not be back, as there are plenty of restaurants in town that feed you, not fool you."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, and it was amazing! Our server, Aaron, was attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. We were quite impressed with him. We spoke to Chad, the manager, about our pleasant experience and enjoyed our chat with him....even though he is a gamecocks fan! 

All of the food from the corn fritter appetizer to our steak dinners was well seasoned and very tasty! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great choice for Easter dinner!!  Just two of us could get together for Easter so why cook?  We started with Moscow Mules.  The lamb chops over garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach were new to the menu so they were a definite and I had the NY Strip with a baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon sugar.  We didn't order an appetizer because we wanted dessert.  Ha!  With the side salads and main entrees, there was no room for it!  Everything was cooked just right.  Our waitress, Kate, was nice, friendly, and efficient!!  What an enjoyable way to celebrate the holiday."}
{"text":"We stopped in from out of the area and the food was great. Not extremely crowded and the atmosphere was nice. We did have to wait a bit for the check due to our waitress being busy with other tables. However understandable, it was still a mental drain of being bored waiting. Hence the -1 star. Otherwise it's a great place for food and to eat. :-)"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with the family today, had to rush because I had to be at work, I told the server and I had my food quickly, and it was cooked to perfection. The Flo's filet is the way to go, not to mention they actually understand the term medium rare, first time I have ever gone to a steakhouse and ordered a steak and not had to send it back because it was over or undercooked. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my birthday. The food was good and I had a nice time with my family."}
{"text":"I come here 2-3 times a month, usually the food is very good. Over the past two months service and food has declined. I always order my steak Medium and this is what I got today. The server said its Medium even though this is definitely a Medium Well at minimum."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite resturant in town after cheddars, there steak is great and there appetizers are good whoever gave this place a low score are losers!"}
{"text":"Longhorn Steakhouse is awesome!  It seemed quite busy when we were there, but the food was phenomenal and the wait staff was great.

I had the white cheddar and bacon stuffed filet, which I prefer well done.  Not only was it done to perfection, but still tender, which many places cannot accomplish.  

Great steaks and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there are so few reviews. The food is wonderful. Always a line up. Make reservations if you want to try this place. Best steakhouse in the area. The steak is cooked exactly the way you want. I didn't think they were expensive at all, around $20 for a steak. I think that's reasonable for what you are getting. The four of us ate around $100. Make a reservation if you want to try this place otherwise the wait is really really long. My husband had the Porter house steak. It was huge. It was cooked perfect. I had the crab stuffed fillet of beef. It was really good. 

They are at the waterfront. Love this area, right by the theatre."}
{"text":"I am not a big national chain guy but they do a good job here.   My main goto is the ribs.  Everyone looks at me funny when I say this but they are pretty good.  You will never need a knife to eat ribs here.  Usually you get grab a bone and it comes right off the rack.   Also the Salmon is good. Especially if you pair this with a sweet potato.  

Prices are good for what you get (main with a side and salad).  I would repeat when I need some good ribs."}
{"text":"This place is nasty.   Server got everyone's order screwed up.  All steaks were either over cooked or under cooked.   It took her forever to bring food over.  Sheff in the restaurant sucks as well.  All I can say is nasty, nasty, nasty."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner there and usually I hate going to restaurants with a large family but I must say, our waiter Kendall made our dinner extraordinary.  He was fast, friendly and he knew the menu and could answer all our questions.  Great job"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I'm usually skeptical of chain restaurants, but we were just there for dinner, and it was fantastic! We got the tonion to start, and I loved the dipping sauce that came with. I ordered a Parmesan encrusted flat iron steak and it was done perfectly and the Parmesan was so delicious! My husband really liked his steak too. I think we will likely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with co-workers (out of state training). We were seated rather quickly, and everything was fine. The server was friendly, brought us our drinks and we placed our order. However, it took between 35-40 minutes for us to get our meals. The order was neither fancy nor complicated. We ended up requesting to have our meals boxed, since it took all of our lunch time.

One thing that we noticed is that we were the only minorities in the restaurant. I didn't think much of it, until a caucasian couple which was seated after us, ended up being served before us. I don't know if it was just poor service or a way to keep certain types of people out of the restaurant, which caused our meals to get extensively delayed.

Bottom line, if you are a minority (Asian, Latino, African-American, etc.), do not be surprised if it takes ages for your food to arrive. If you think about it, it is a very subtle way to keep \"unwanted\" individuals out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible consideration for large groups,  we called ahead and hour  and a half,   going on two hours. We know it's new years eve, but we made arrangements ahead.  Not happy."}
{"text":"I know it's only a snapshot in time ... but I had a great meal here, with exceptional service from A.J.  I was by myself (traveling on business) and hopped off I-85 to eat. The tonion was really good and A.J. delivered each of my courses exactly as ordered (I am particular about everything). I had a tossed salad, with their delicious (my fave) honey mustard dressing. My main course was the smaller portion of Flo's filet. I asked for it well done and it came out perfectly--warm, juicy and not even a hint of pink!!!  Kudos to the kitchen!!!!  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. :-)"}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh Steakhouse (but I *DO* like this one)
Located at the far side of West Waterfront Drive in Homestead

PROS:
Very nice staff
We really enjoy the food, steaks and appetizers, alike
Restrooms are clean
Restaurant is clean
Bar area to grab a drink at and sneak a peak at the menu if you have to wait to be seated.

CONS:
a bit pricey, most are"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Very shocked to know that they host would not allow us to have a booth when there were over a half a dozen available. I even asked her for her booth and she told me no. Decided to eat at the bar and the bartender literally threw the menus at us in front of the bar. The steakhouse next-door was packed while Longhorn only had a few people. I can see why"}
{"text":"I came here looking for a place with good steak. Boy I was wrong. I ordered the flat iron and it was smaller than my hand. I asked for it to be medium rare and it was completely cooked. My waitress was so RUDE she ignored me up until the very end when she acted nice to get a tip. She was very angry looking, infact all the waitresses there did not look happy. The waitress brought me my salad and I had to wait 15 MINUTES TO GET A FORK! And I had to ask a different waitress for it too. I should've listened to the other reviews and not have came because it was the WORST experience I've had at a fancy place like that. I didn't even want to eat my damn food because how irritated I was with everyone."}
{"text":"Love my steak and loaded potato.  My husband had lamb chop and is amazing as well.   We only waited 20 minutes during mothers day so it wasn't bad.   The server was great, Paige, very accommodating.  The corner we were seated at was too cold for me and despite the very busy day she managed to sit us else where.  The staff was great and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is great but today the service was really slow. Not sure if it was the waitress or the kitchen that was not on the ball but when your complimentary bread takes 10 minutes to be served and then another 15 minutes for your appetizer and then another 15 minutes for your salad and then add on another 15 minutes or more for your main course is in my opinion is a little much considering they were not busy at all. I realize that they give you time to eat what you have in front of you before bringing out the next course but this was overkill today"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.  The service needs more attention...more training.  One example:  my wife ordered a steak and asked about the wine selection.  The server stated she did not know much about wine!  At a steakhouse??  Training will help their staff.  Food was terrific!  Beer selection was great."}
{"text":"We had the best service from the second we walked in he door until we left. The hostess, whose name was Alexis I believe, was super friendly. We sat at the bar while waiting for a booth and the bartender was just as upbeat and friendly. The wait was minimal, and they got us seated promptly. We had two severs, Maureen and Ashely, both were attentive, fun, and made sure we had fresh cold drinks and perfect food as ordered. The appetizer was soooo good, and a generous portion, the main courses were superb, steaks cooked PERFECT. I know it's a steak house and that should be a given, but I cannot tell you how often I've ordered a medium cooked filet served either tough as a rock or so bloody it was still twitching....But these steaks were perfection. Sides were delicious. We WILL be back, not only was the service fabulous but the food and drink was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Weekly sodium requirement in one meal!
Summary...
Service: Friendly and relaxed waitstaff. Full of smiles and assistant staff is at your call. Drinks kept full. The wait time on the food was entirely too long. Went for late lunch arriving at 2pm and only saw 2 other tables and still it took a long time.
Food: Salty. It seems their favorite flavor is salt. Every single item had salt in it or on it, even the toast.
Price: Not worth it! We paid $21.99 for an 8oz Filet (ordered Medium and it was cooked properly) and we had difficulty cutting it with the knife because of the gristle. 
We had to try it since we haven't been before. We won't return."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal! The Hawaiian Salmon was actually better then I had on Maui just a few weeks ago. I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouse dinners I've had that wasn't steak. I had the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich and it was delicious. Everyone at the table was happy with their dinners-- corn on the cob, fish, and a steak. I hadn't been to Longhorns in forever and I'd forgotten how great the food is. Great value for the price too."}
{"text":"As a server, I'm always understanding of the ups and downs of a busy night. However, it wasn't the long wait or lack of refills on our beverages but the attitude the accompanied any plea for anything. Longhorn clearly isn't Flemings but rudeness is just uncalled for."}
{"text":"The corn fritters ,spicy chicken bites,and   bacon cheddar dip was good. The ribeye steak with cook pretty good. The problem came with the service the waitress was not attentive she forgot to put in some of the orders so one person was left out why everybody else was eating (only three people in the party).Some people are not cut out to be waitresses or work within a customer service field."}
{"text":"I don't particularly like chain restaurants but decided to give them a try

My overall experience was the food was good but very basic

The young man who is bartending gave excellent service and could run the whole place himself

As for the manager on duty wasted his time sitting on the corner doing nothing and he was very rude to a customer

After seeing that I could not go back in this place

It's too many other places you can just go to and not see that

I gave it a 4 1/2"}
{"text":"Love their Primetime happy hour margaritas. I love the steak and the red rock shrimp...the marinade is delicious. I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"First time here in a while prices have gone up. Just a plain burger is 11 dollars and that is the cheapest thing  on the menu. The burger was frozen and not tasty at all. Will not be returning due to price and I can get a better somewhere else.as a chef I am completely disappointed in the quality of food here"}
{"text":"I know it sounds crazy, but this place is actually pretty good for vegetarian!!

NO JOKE!

I had to travel to NC for work and was entirely besides myself wondering what I would be limited to eat for three days.  Being the nice lady that I am, just had to go with the flow when my coworkers decided they wanted to go to the Texas LongHorn Steakhouse for dinner.  But low and behold, no worries whatsoever!

First off, the environment is very decent: dimly lit restaurant and bar seatings, both fun for a group.  

Starting with the drinks, they do have a full bar with some pretty heavy-handed bartenders.  Maybe that's the \"Texas\" part.  I had a glass (or two ;) of Pinot Noir from Cali of course.

To my surprise, food was on point!  Nothing super fancy. Just a CRAZY portion size of good vegetarian selections that included the double-baked potato (with bleu cheese), baked broccoli and asparagus on the side.  Add that to my wine plus fantastic service and I was pretty set.

Not that I plan to make any more trips back to Charlotte, but if I did, this would be a solid choice :)"}
{"text":"I returned today for the first time since my July review. I had their BBQ beef sandwich with parmesan fries, which was very good. My friend had the ribeye steak, which was overcooked. She never sends anything back, but she did today. The second steak was cooked perfectly, a much better cut, and she said it was perfect. Much to our surprise, they took her entire meal--$16.99--off the check. Plus, we had a $3 off coupon that they took off. Since my friend used to teach restaurant management, she knows her cuts of meat, and she suspects the cook used the wrong cut of beef and cooked it by the time for the other cut, which was too long. The manager was just too concerned and apologetic for a regular overcooking. Anyway, kudos to the management and great waitress for an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"The food & service was great we were quick to be seated & the servers were great & very friendly . The overall environment was amazing ."}
{"text":"Food was great but was nothing compared to the excellent service the two bartenders provided."}
{"text":"I arrived at Longhorn with my lovely girlfriend after leaving another horribly serviced restaurant.  Longhorn is on the way home from work and although it's a chain, I have eaten at them before and thought for price paid and service it was a good deal.  This was not the case tonight.  I was surprised as every time we drive by this location it is always packed.  We even skipped on it before multiple times for not wanting to wait.  
Anyway, we get in, were quickly taken to our table with drinks ordered.  Food was next I opted for Bone in Rib eye with salad and sweet potato and she ordered non-bone in rib eye with loaded baked potato and side salad.
Our waiter was a bit on the overzealous side and spoke with his best fake Texan accent...Little did he know my my lovely is in fact a True Texan.  
Anyway...Salads come out and were pretty good.  Drinks were empty and were not now offered to be refreshed....I was impressed w/ the BBQ chopped salad and she seemed to like the Caesar salad.  Bread was good....
Next the main plates...First off they describe in the menu a loaded baked potato which in reality is not even close to what is served; rather more like deflated microwave cooked baked potato with day old butter on it.  My sweet potato on the other hand, just did not taste fresh.  I love sweet potatoes and I'm not sure how this got messed up, but it did.
As for the steaks, Rib eye ...it was almost like eating sirloin.....not very juicy although we requested Medium cooking (hers was more medium well done).  The best part of mine was the small part attached directly to the bone.  Overall it was not very juicy and did not seem to have good flavoring cooked into it. 
I was quite upset to realize my delicious tasting memories of Longhorn are now long-gone."}
{"text":"Listen, I won't make this long. This \"restaurant\" is just an Applebees covered in antlers. Since a giant piece of poorly cooked steak didn't really look good to me, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich. On the menu, this is the description: \"Grilled folded flatbread stuffed with tomatoes, red chili ranch, avocado spread and Colby jack. So full of flavor you'll need an extra napkin! \"

When the sandwich came, after I had already eaten my poorly dressed Caesar salad (that didn't even come with any croutons), it looked pathetic. There was absolutely no sauce and only a small trace of avocado spread. The sandwich consisted of huge chunks of grilled chicken covered in cheese, with one slice of tomato and one piece of lettuce. I had to ask the server for some of the mystery red chili ranch since none came with my meal. I didn't need an extra napkin, as the menu stated. It was pathetic. 

I also ate some of the french fries and green beans that came with my boyfriend's steak. The green beans were as small and stringy as a middle school boy's scrawny arms, and the french fries were disgusting and way under seasoned.

Why would anyone eat here? It was bad, slow, gross, unappealing, and just overall disappointing. I suggest they go out of business. 

Fuck you, Longhorn Steakhouse. Fuck you."}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:30 on Easter Sunday 2018. There was nine of us altogether, we have eaten here A few times in the past. Food is always top notch, however,We have never had exceptional service. I was a little excited when our server introduced herself and the gentleman training with her. Wow! I thought they're not busy and with two of them serving us How can we not get great service!? Sadly, I was hugely mistaken. I almost hate paying for drinks, when they're free refills but your server or helper are not around to get those refills for you. After our two appetizers were dropped off about 10 minutes later, she came to ask how the appetizer was and I told her great! We just need something to wash it down. Out of nine of us, nobody had anything left to drink. And then the concept of clearing plates/dishes was never considered. We just kept making piles in the middle the table. When the meals were dropped off my son was notified at that moment that they were out of sweet potatoes. Really! At 1 o'clock on Easter Sunday! Like, you don't know this when you put the order in a half hour ago?Never came back to check how steaks were prepared, My Mom's was supposed to be medium rare and it was medium well but it took so long to get somebody over there that we just had hers boxed up to go. Believe we saw the manager doing a couple laps around the restaurant stopping at other tables, never stopped at ours, or came over  to apologize about the first well-done steak and bring my mom her second and suggest that she cut into it to make sure it's prepared correctly like we've seen other steakhouses do. I understand steaks/fillets can be hit or miss, but service should never be! Especially from the so-called management. Very disappointed. Server told us they were super busy and they were understaffed in the kitchen and in the waitstaff. There were several empty tables around us and throughout the restaurant. Poor thing, I don't know how she would handle it if they were truly \"super busy \"will not be returning. Going back next-door to Texas roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Used to really like their steaks. .flavorful. .reasonably priced.  Our dinner this past Saturday was awful. Ordered the filet with crabcake and side of creamed spinach.   All i tasted was salt. The server said next time ask for light seasoning.   If that was the problem. .then why was the creamed spinach also too salty.
My friend orderd pork chops. .extremely salty.
Server tried to help by offering to redo meal. .so that was commendable.   But we didn't want to wait.
Very disappointed. .used to love this place."}
{"text":"This review is redemption. I am so happy I can give Longhorn Steakhouse a 5-star rating, because I had stayed away from them for years due to an awful experience at the Bridgeville location. Like, a \"Gordon Ramsey would've had an aneurism\" bad experience. But I like to give chains second chances, and I'm glad I did. 

I took my parents here recently and was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. They said it would be a 15 minute wait - nothing at all - and the buzzers were buzzing for us to be seated probably within 3. Service was terrific all around. Our waitress was attentive without being nosy; she was helpful and cheerful. No complaints there. 

I ordered a salad which came loaded with chunky blue cheese. I could tell the ingredients tasted very fresh, and if they weren't, they fooled me entirely. I ordered a flat-iron steak cooked medium well, with asparagus on the side. 

In the years it had been since I ate at a Longhorn Steakhouse, I completely forgot that they aren't really the same as an Outback. I would consider Longhorn a little bit more refined, from everything to the atmosphere, the food presentation, and the dining ware. But let's get down to what really matters... my steak. 

Oh Lord, my steak. It was heaven on a plate. The horrendous incident at the Bridgeville Longhhorn years ago involved having to send my dad's steak back to the kitchen no less than three times... not at the McCandless one. They cooked this thing to PERFECTION. It was warm, just slightly pink, juicy, tucked up against a beautiful bouquet of lemon asparagus, which was tender but not too 'soggy.' I could have eaten miles of this steak. It was fantastic. 

The prices are a bit high for everyday eating, at least on my budget, but I won't dock Longhorn for that. You get what you pay for. The portion size was just right. I didn't feel too full or hungry when I left. I definitely felt that my food was prepared with care in mind, and that it was appropriate for the price. 

I will definitely be back. Way to turn things around, Longhorn!"}
{"text":"My mistake for ordering the chicken at a steak house haha, it was wayyyyyyy wayyyyy too salted. Everything else was good but nothing was spectacular. Great service and very polite."}
{"text":"Just left Longhorn for a late birthday meal. I was impressed that the chain has several new offerings that all appeared unique. Things went wrong from the start with our hostess seating us, two adults and a child at a massive round top table that, so as we could not carry on a decent conversation and having to reach for everything due to the awkward angle of the table. The server was ok, somewhat forgetful but ok at best. We ordered a petite filet and the new Kobe steak burger. The filet had several inedible pieces that were tough and stringy. The burger was on the same level as steakum sandwich meat from the frozen food section of your local supermarket and the fries were salted to the point they were inedible. We quickly found out our child's chicken and fry kids meal was just as salty. I should have heeded warning in a previous review of the overall excessive use of salt. I usually don't expect a lot out of Longhorn, just decent chain steakhouse food that is a step above outback with selection and quality. Do yourself a favor and skip this location. The place was very sparse on guests and we still couldn't find a manager to come to our table."}
{"text":"Bad experience and I'm not a picky unforgiving person. The waitress was super unfriendly almost to the point of rude. Both of our steaks were not cooked to desired done-ness. The primerib was underseasoned and cold. The filet was overdone and way over seasoned. When we told the waitress our food was not very good she didn't say anything!! She just walked away!! Needless to say we will never return to this unfortunate restaurant."}
{"text":"Was happy with our experience...
The good... Flat iron steak was great. Mac n cheese was the bomb. Sweet potato was delish. Denise our server was super friendly and welcoming.
The bad... Well, nothing was bad. So what could have better? The bread was good but not the best restaurant bread I have had. The spinach dip was very good but a little heavy on the spinach. Nobody checked on us after we got our food so I ate most of the steak before getting any A1 sauce. To their credit we did eat very quickly. 
Overall great experience and would come again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here because we both were craving steak. We started off with the Wild West Shrimp appetizer, wow let me tell you a must have if you go here. The shrimp is spicy and even better when dipped in ranch. We both ordered the 6oz Filet Mignon and we both were very pleased with it, very tender and cooked the way we asked (medium rare). Also had the house salad and corn on the cob, the salad was good I was not a fan of the corn had zero flavor. We sat in the bar area great service. With all that said I would recommend this restaurant. $80"}
{"text":"Every time we go here its perfect.  Our waitress was exceptional tonight! Best steak around!!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and we each had the 11oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato and caesar salad. All were delicious! Our steaks were cooked exactly how we ordered them. My husband ordered the Montana Mule and commented on how great (and strong) it was. I had the strawberry daiquiri which was okay. Nothing to brag about. 

Despite the food being delicious, the service was pretty bad. We waited almost 45 minutes for a table, after being told there was a wait of 30-35 minutes. Within a few minutes of being seated, we were asked our drink order by the hostess, but the drinks didn't come for almost 20 minutes. Our server was nice, but the restaurant was very under staffed for the amount of people there on a Thursday night. Luckily we weren't in any hurry, as we were there for two hours from the time we arrived to the time we paid our check and left. It seems they just need to hire (or schedule) more servers."}
{"text":"The 8oz Renegade sirloin was tonight's dinner choice with a baked potato and a side if sautéed mushrooms. Absolutely the best dinner I've had here in months. The entire steak was cooked to perfection and it ate every bite. The shrooms were perfectly cooked and flavored, the baked potato was mouth watering. Lesley had her normal salmon entree and said it too was fantastic! Major props to the kitchen staff tonight as they cooked our meals perfectly while the restaurant was semi full. Service was great as is the norm. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lately among my other serious curses (like diarrhea in traffic or the sudden appearance of the reproductive organ on your foot) there is a new one: may you eat in chain restaurants for the rest of your life! 
I have a strong suspicion that we live only once, and in case I am going to return here in the form of the toilet seat or a bug, I demand good food. And such a desire of mine cannot be quite fulfilled in chain joints. 
First of all, iceberg salad. Really? Last time generic iceberg salad was on my plate Cristina Aguilerra was skinny,Michael Jackson alive, Britney Spears - popular and troops were headed to Iraq, which is the beginning of Millennium. I evolved to colorful greens since then.  Just for the record. My entree was ok (chicken with portabella mushroom). Actually quite tasty. But one needs to know that I was prepared for it to be very mediocre after the salad. 
Woman vacuuming right by our table was a major buzz-killer.  I felt like a schoolgirl eating in my mom's kitchen when she asked us to lift up our feet so she can vacuum under the table.She was also in my way of taking pictures of my entree or trying on cowboy boots on the display.
 In general very mediocre. But I am very excited I survived the chain dining experience without food poisoning or any harsh feelings. Plus I felt very encouraged to start cooking more at home. 
Up-side: cowboy boots 
Downside: they are nailed to the wall"}
{"text":"Need to update the review. The manager was nice enough to reach out to me to try to resolve my satisfaction level based on my previous experience. Very nice to do, excellent customer service. This place may just not be for is. We went in to use the certificate the manager provided us and it just isn't a place we feel is our quality. But I did want to thank Longhorns and their manager for trying to make things right. That's always appreciated."}
{"text":"Medium Rare = Medium 
Medium = Well Done 
Wait staff mediocre at best. Wait staff did not come to ask if our steaks were cooked correctly. Worst experience I have had in a Longhorn in 3 years. Thank god the Longhorn in Virginia Beach, Virginia knows how to cook a steak. Totally dissatisfied. Wouldn't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Dinner with 13 friends, I suggest Longhorn HUGE MISTAKE!!  I order 2 appetizer the crab bites and the bisons meatballs. The appetizer were served cold. Very disappointed with this location. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"1st review I've ever done on a restaurant. 

Took my wife there & it was the worst $70 I've ever spent on a meal. 

Waited almost an hour for a table, ordered my Rib Eye Med Well & it was Rare, food was salty & the service was just ok. 

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Well, won a gift card from work, so decided to use it here on Friday at 5:00. No wait to sit. Kecia the waitress came over and took drink orders. Drinks, soup and salads came promptly and were delicious  
We ordered the porterhouse for 2 and that came right on time. Cooked just like we wanted and it was huge. We ate almost all of it, but still had strip left over for breakfast  
Had the sampler for desert and that tastes great with IBC root beer. 

Freakishly good time and we will come back."}
{"text":"Always great steaks, cooked to perfection! Service was good. My only request would be to pay a bit more attention to cleanliness, specifically the bathroom and the salt/pepper grinders. Overall, we enjoy coming here on a date night or with family/friends."}
{"text":"Visiting family from Chicago and wanting to enjoy a meat at what was my favorite restaurant. First we called in front parking lot to ask the wait.  We were told no wait. Once inside, the wait was 20 minutes only after speaking with manager.  Wait for our food....then served the wrong dishes and two of my guests were not given their food. I told the waiter what was missing, she told me she only two hands but clearly her colleagues was assisting. I informed the management who apologized and served the two missed meal but by then my entire meal was dampened  by the poor service received.  This place is a prime example of what poor customer service is. Training is needed."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 other people. Service was fine for the most part. The main dishes took a while, but I understand that was probably because of our large party.

Spinach dip was good. Texas \"Tonions\" were alright. The Grilled Redrock Shrimp plate was tasty.

Overall, just an average steakhouse."}
{"text":"This restaurant is smaller than normal and with a few larger groups in the middle, it fills up quick. The waiting area is not so accommodating, maybe it is to get people to drink in the bar. Once the hostess finally noticed we were there, she was very unfamiliar with the table numbering. Oh well, we finally got sat, the service was just eh' okay. The food was good, but rare is VERY RARE. Would visit again, but just maybe not this location."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and it was awesome!! I'm not a big fan of fatty meats , I had the sirloin and it had no fat it was excellent .i also had the chocolate stampede for dessert and it was delicious.staff was great"}
{"text":"Ribeye Steak was horrible!!!!! 
Salad, honey wheat bread excellent.

I personally had a bad steak my parents both had the Ribeye and liked it.

I could have taken that 20.00 dollars and bought 5 Wal-Mart brand steaks that would thicker and tasted better.

I grill steak and buy different cuts all the time I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I like that the menu changes and there are new appetizers and specials from time to time.  I also like that there is a happy hour discount menu.  Servers are always friendly and the lighting is relaxing after a hard day.  My only complaint is how long it usually takes to get drinks and food.  We often wait a pretty long time for the first drinks and last night it took a pretty long time to get our food too.  Otherwise, I really really like this place and it's close to my house so I'd like to be a regular-- just need quicker food and drinks on the table.  Food is very very good."}
{"text":"I've only been to Longhorn 3 times since I moved here 2 years ago. I must say that all 3 times its been excellent with the best service around- I even remember my servers name from two years ago- Ray! Longhorn's motto is \"fresh, never frozen\" so it was a delight to get to eat here again for an event. What I like best about Longhorn is that they aren't afraid to season their meats. So many times hubby and I have dined out and paid $$$$ for a steak that may have been a nice cut, but lacked any flavor whatsoever. What impressed me about this place is that you can tell your server to either go easy on the seasoning, or the way they usually  do it or go heavier. I want a steak with flavor, baby! I also don't want any fat and I don't want it to look like it was just taken from the animal, so  no pink for me. Usually when I ask for well done they want to burn the steak. In the case of tonight's meal it was cooked to perfection and not burned. It was also easy to cut into and eat. It was the perfect portion for me on their summer menu- the pepper crusted filet with shrimp along with a loaded Idaho potato.
We had a variety of appetizers to try, with my favorite being the wild west shrimp. My least favorite would be the fried green tomatoes. The breading fell off and it just wasn't good. Being a big bread person, the bread too fell short of my expectations and wasn't anything special to write home about. The Blue ridge wedge salad was nicely presented and good. The hand shaken margarita's are very nice. GET one! We were also served sweet corn fritters, hand battered portabello, brew pub pretzel sticks. but again my hands down favorite would have to be the wild west shrimp. I did have a taste of the brew Pub pretzel sticks and they were good but I am not sure how they fit in with everything else offered on the appetizer menu.
Dessert of course is my favorite part of any meal, and I am a solid chocolate person and the chocolate stampede did not disappoint. The peach cobbler is amazing and I know my husband wouldn't share if he had that in front of him.
A solid GREAT meal with a not so pricey tag compared to those high end steakhouses! When you want steak to be the star of your meal, then go here!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I tried This chain because generally I don't gravitate to chains. A friend suggested meeting here for dinner so I complied. What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The service was top notch and the food  turned out to be quite good for a moderate price steakhouse.
We shared a great appetizer of stuffed mushrooms. Very tasty! While the bread and salad were average the stuffed filet was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty and seasoned!! Very important for a great steak. 
I was very pleased overall with the meal and the price and wouldn't hesitate to return to this chain or location!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and lobster chowder, which I fell in love with on my last visit... this time it was extremely thick and had a flavor like it had gone bad. I let the server know and he replaced it with another side, a manger never came to address it. I felt sick the rest of the day and couldn't get that taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Justin is absolutely amazing. Best service ever. Dinner is always fabulous and the watermelon margaritas are to die for. Ask for Justin - he's the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best steakhouse in the Cleveland area. The 30oz porter house steaks was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. Our waitress was amazing, took care of our drinks, kept the bread on the table. This was probably the best day ever. In fact it was Easter"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.

Let's get our priorities in order:

In terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.

Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:

I had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.    

Entrees:
I tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.

The house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.

The bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.

My baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.

All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for a steak dinner 

Asked for water with lemon, got water. Had to ask for some lemons. 

We got the tonion appetizer- it was really good. Little onion petals. 

Our steaks came out over cooked. I just ate mine, my husband had to send his back 

My husband ordered a little Apple pie w ice cream for dessert - he didn't love it. I ordered chocolate lava cake - it was delicious. Coffee was good

All in all, we were disappointed in our meal. Not sure we will come back here, there are so many other choices out there."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say good or bad about eatung here. I wasn't very hungry so I just had the baked potato soup but it was just okay and I only finished half of a cup of it. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"It was a late night and almost everything else was closed. I was VERY happy that I had an option for dinner. There were three or four other tables filled at the time so we figured that it couldn't be that bad. I was hungry and quick to order:

Bread and Butter
French Onion Soup
Boneless Buffalo Wings
16oz Prime Rib (medium) with baked sweet potato and Mac'n cheese

I was happy to have the bread arrive so soon after our order due to how hungry I was; it helped that it was actually rather tasty. I was hoping that the bread would be a foreshadowing of the rest of the meal when the french onion soup arrived. I was a tad let down by the size of the soup. I was really let down when I tried to the soup; it was just not something I wanted to order again. 

As I was picking through the soup, my boneless buffalo wings arrived. I immediately switched gears and dug into the wings. I don't understand what they did in the kitchen, but the wings tasted more like liquid smoke than buffalo. My thoughts of a great late-night dinner were quickly dissipating. At this point, I was hoping that the entree would should show me something that was better than what I had tried.

When the entree arrived I was surprised yet again by the fact that my mac'n cheese was missing. My server assured me that it would be coming so dug into the meat and sweet potato. I was still rather hungry since I hadn't eaten much of the soup or the wings. The meat was a tad overcooked while the sweet potato was undercooked. I moved the potato to the side and focused on the meat. While I never did receive the mac'n cheese, I don't know that I would have eaten considering the quality of the rest of the food.

After seeing the bill, I can guarantee that I won't return to this particular steakhouse."}
{"text":"Longhorn is located in the parking lot of the now defunct Fiesta Mall. The location had ample parking, and was large. Regarding the parking, the only complaint I would have is that if one parks on the east side of the lot, you have trouble getting out, because the long In & Out Burger line wraps to that opening.

The staff was welcoming upon entry. We were told that despite the restaurant looking relatively quiet, there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We took a seat with our pager in hand, and were literally called before we settled on the bench. No complaint there! Many tables were slow to be bussed, and the hostess washed our table to seat us. 

Our server was named Kaylee. She was very friendly and accommodating. Our drink orders were taken, and came out quickly with salads and honey wheat bread. We did have to ask for silverware, and another staff member ended up bringing them. The bread was crusty in the outside, warm and soft inside. The Caesar salads? were underwhelming. The lettuce was good quality. The salad had light, flavorless dressing. The croutons were fine, but the salad was covered with exorbitant parmesan.

I ordered the 8oz. Flo's filet mignon with a sugar cinnamon sweet potato. The filet was a bit more well than medium, but had great flavor. The potato was fine. My husband ordered the lamb with garlic mashed potatoes. He ordered the lamb rare. It came well, and was extremely chewy. He could barely cut it, and had not been given a steak knife, so ended up with the bread knife, just to get his underwhelming meat. He was extremely disappointed, and said that he felt that it had been cooked after turning brown with age, making the meat rubbery. His potatoes were fine.

The drinks were fine, and we were checked on often. The watermelon margarita was tasty and plentiful. I wasn't impressed that the bill was dropped with dinner plates still on the table, but otherwise, service was good.

The cleanliness of the restaurant and the restrooms were on point.

Don't be afraid to give Longhorn a try, but be sure to stress the way you would like your meat cooked. That's really where they fell short."}
{"text":"This place is great! Sure, it's a chain, but sometimes you just want consistent, quality steak and that's just what you'll get here! I love the ribeye and Mac n cheese. 

Do not try the seasonal Sam Adams PEI mussels. So disgusting. They were super fishy tasting and did not look anything like the picture on the menu. Ew. Never again"}
{"text":"Anyplace you can go and get a filet for $20 is awesome in my book.  Sat at the bar and received great service from Justin.  Everyone was friendly with a great attitude l.  The food was amazing, I've never had longhorn before.  My steak was seasoned and cook very well.  I would recommend if you've never eaten here to not add salt pepper or anything to your steak just enjoy the bold seasoning they use.  My filet was not only tender but juicy.  The mashed potatoes were soooooo good.  They put butter in the middle and it just melts all over, those were delicious.  It's nice inside, I went on a quiet Monday.  Will definitely be back here when in town for business."}
{"text":"Server Taylor couldn't have been sweeter, hustled, smiled, spot on service! New York strip medium rare melted in mouth good! Asparagus crisp! Deep fried pickles were great because they were thinly sliced. I wish the Tonions didn't come with a sauce drizzled on them, but were tasty, the competitions bloomin onion probably better. But overall longhorn was great"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time.  Foods was amazing and, Steve, our waiter was very good!  Not only good, but very fun, too!

There were 4 of us, two had the ribeye steak, one had the chicken, and one had the Mahi Mahi.....  everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals!

Will definitely be making a return trip to this place!!"}
{"text":"Let's note the smokestacks right outside the location and how cool they make it look.

Came here for a yelp event and it was quite extravagant... Steaksgiving

Obviously this is chain. The inside decor is standard western and is very clean.

Our waiter was extremely attentive patiently  giving us a detailed explanation of what the options on the menu were. 

The food to my surprise landed a bit above par. 

The pretzel sticks were very good, as well as the chicken bites, and sweet corn pritters for the win! Wild West shrimp was nothing special...

The blue cheese salad was alright one complaint I had was that it was uncut but no big deal.


Got an 18 oz outlaw ribeye medium well... No complaints there. Nice juicy steak.

Not a big fan of potato and leek au cheese side. Do asparagus or Mac and cheese. 

Dessert was pretty good had chocolate and pumpkin spice cake, also a tart was offered which was my favorite.

Longhorn did an awesome job with this event. Loved it."}
{"text":"Wife got a ribeye meduim, and it came out medium. Comes with a salad and a side.
She didn't get a salad but did get a baked potato with the fixins
I got the napa chicken breasts, it was very moist. Comes with roma tomatoes, artichokes and mushrooms. I got the salad bluecheese. 
Everything was very good, we both complained about the salt, just a little too much. 
Everyone was very nice. 
And it was very clean. 
And just got lucky with the parking, someone just happened to pull out when we got there."}
{"text":"This place is great usually great service and good food.... Nice atmosphere and not nosey where you can't hear the person across from you..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 10 minutes with the bartender walking back and forth with no acknowledgement. They where not busy just rather talk to the girls than even ask what i would like to drink and a menue. 
Got up and went to Outback. Served as soon as I sat down and they where packed."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience at this place.  Food was great but service was just ok.  I had to ask 3x's for ranch dressing for my son whose food got cold by the time he finally got the ranch and was antsy waiting so long.  Desserts were delicious too!  All in all, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Never again waited an hour from the moment my food was supposedly put in for the plates to arrive at the table. Horrible service and every 5min I was told the food would be right out smh talk about BS save yourself the hassle and go to another steak house in Surprise"}
{"text":"Sometimes await worth the wait. Order is always correct and timely and great service by sue and she is also excellent great bartender and Patrick is fabulous as well don't do chain restaurant this is one will do especially great location."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night. It wasn't crowded and we were able to be seated. This was my first time at this location. It's located near Carolina place mall with several dinning options nearby. It took the server a while to get to us despite the light crowd and once she was there she didn't introduce herself or ask for certain things like what would you like to drink?!  It was like she was distracted. Needless to say we placed our order and waited a while for our food. Again no one was in here. The food came out and it was at the right temperature and texture. It was okay in taste. Nothing I would recommend. FYI the bread at this place is all potato bread so if you want different rolls or styles it isn't available. The bathrooms were clean. They have a rewards program where you can earn freebies if you dine here or at any of the sister restaurants. Check it out if you do so you can save."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is always on point. I eat my steak Extra RARE, my wife does hers medium and they are perfect every time. The Beefsteak Tomato and Bacon salad is amazing also!"}
{"text":"I love Longhorn Steakhouse.  I like mostly all dishes because I think everything is seasoned really well. 

Regarding this visit, we went out as a family (hubby, me, my mother, and the girls). Initially, we were put in small table, but they accommodated us by moving us to a bigger booth, which was more comfortable. 

We got a crab dip for the appetizer and it was a large portion. Enough to go around. I got my standard steak and absolutely loved it. They cook their steak with enough seasoning and to perfection that you don't need steak sauce. Also, their sweet potatoes with the butter and brown sugar are so mouth watering. 

Our waitress was very attentive and made sure to bring out my daughters food first, so she wouldn't get fussy. She also brought back crayons for her to play with to keep her occupied.

It's right off of Harris not to far from 85, so very convenient."}
{"text":"Had blue motorcycle. Didn't like it. Could not taste any alcohol and you could tell immediately it was a weak drinker. I thought when you SIT at the bar they KNOW to make your drink right. Well obviously this lady's didn t know to do this.  Oh well I won't order a watwrdown drink from this place again 
Food was good had a ribeye with salad. Cooked med rate it was delicious."}
{"text":"I know each bartender is different BUTTTTT I ordered a blue motorcycle then I ordered a Lond Island island. Basically same ingredients except one has that blue stuff and spirit and the other has sour mix and coke. They have the same alcohol mix. Why after 2 drinks I tasted NOOOOOOOOOOOOO alcohol. I'm convinced the drinks here are water down. I will never purchase a drink again. 
I had salmon Cesar salad it was good but why I could see the BOTTOM of my plate. They don't give you enough lettuce. Ughhhh. I will try another location but this one is a NO Go and waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The food is pretty average for a steakhouse, I think, and the service is also mediocre.  Nothing about this place pops out at me as excellent.  

The last time I went was two nights ago.  The service was okay -- our waiter had to be reminded to bring us bread, and whenever we'd ask for something, he'd come back to check on us five minutes later with a surprised expression on his face: \"Oh, I forgot the butter!  Let me get that for you!\"  He was pleasant enough, but this certainly wasn't top-notch service.

My fiance ordered his steak rare, and he said that it didn't have very much flavor and wasn't particularly juicy.  His sweet potato was delicious, however, though I find it hard to believe that you can really mess up a baked sweet potato as long as you put enough cinnamon and brown sugar and butter on top.  ;)

I ordered the spinach feta chicken, which I thought was quite good.  The chicken was tender, not overcooked, and the feta added spurts of this salty, strong flavor as I ate.  My side was the loaded baked potato, which was disappointingly not very loaded -- there was just a bit of cheese and a sprinkle of bacon.

We had the parmesan-crusted asparagus for an appetizer, which was delicious -- perfectly seasoned with a nice crunch.  The blueberry lemon butter cake for dessert was moist and had that good balance of sweet and tangy.  

All in all, this place is okay.  I would return if an outing called for it, but it's certainly not my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm a bit sad to write this review because I've always loved Longhorn. The 2 stars exist only because our server was a total sweetheart. She did everything she could to make our dining experience a great one, but the food made it impossible.

Prior to ordering dinner, my husband and I ordered the appetizer sampler. Not impressed! The shrimp was drenched in grease, the mushrooms were ok and the wraps were not worth putting on the plate. For dinner I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye with a baked potato and a salad. It took about and hour to get our meals. My potato was hot, but my steak was undercooked and cold. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with avocado, which was equally unimpressive.

I have always loved a good steak, so I sincerely hope this Longhorn gets their act together. Outback is just up the road...."}
{"text":"Finally made it to a Longhorn, glad I did.  Stopped in for a lunch with my daughter.  It was a slower lunch time (but still a good handful of guests) which is great.  Restaurant was quiet, incredibly clean and the food was excellent.  Very happy with service and food.  Will be going back soon for dinner."}
{"text":"Awful experience. First time at this restaurant. Came from Chandler where we have many choices. Got here at 4:30 . Place was dead. Found it strange that we were told a 10 minute wait. We assumed they were short on servers. The young male who met us never got our name. we walked back up and told a female next time  our name. She said ok. We waited 25 minutes. While we sat and watched many people getting seated. We finally got up and asked why we hadn't been called after 25 minutes. The same female said we were not on the list. She said it wouldn't be long, and then called another couple who just came in.     Don't you think they should have gotten us seated right away? Terrible experience for first visit. Could you imagine if they were busy? A clue perhaps? We went to Black Angus in Chandler."}
{"text":"Can I give them no stars?! This is the worst place to go! Took my mom for her 66th birthday. The place was empty maybe 4 other tables filled. They stick our party of seven in a corner round booth instead of the long table next to us, stating they were expecting another party and needed that table. Mind you the place is empty! 20 minutes to get a sangria and beer because the bartender was MIA. Almost one hour later before our food arrives and it's cold! Ordered a potato soup with no bacon and they didn't bother to tell us it has bacon in it until the other food came out instead of coming out sooner to ask us to make another selection. And we didn't have utensils! And that party that they needed the table for never showed!!!"}
{"text":"For this type of chain restaurant that you know well and service is not always very personal, I have to say that here they made the difference since the moment we sat down and ordered hot tea. It was all thanks to Nathan, who had a very pleasant attitude and who showed that nothing was a problem for him; you just thought of something and he offered it before you even asked for it. This was his manner not only with us but with neighboring tables with kids. Thanks Nathan. Food was good."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time on 7/12/14
Very nice interior decor.

Wait staff seemed relatively clueless starting with almost 15 minutes until we were
Noticed.
It was one of those experiences where you thought you were in the twilight zone!
Waiter comes over to tell us that there was no onion soup while the girl delivers the soup to the table...
Our waiter just seemed checked out and the whole staff looked stretched thin.
Seems  the term medium rare has been replaced by medium on the burgers....mine still came out medium rare.  Corporate thing i'm sure.
I had the steakgouse burger......it was ok and small in the world of 11.00 burgers.
Believe it or not, my girls rib eye was outstanding....,buttery and perfectly seasoned

Maybe we'll try it again for happy hour"}
{"text":"While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients...."}
{"text":"Our family Mother's Day celebration encountered the horrendous service of Longhorn Steakhouse  

I ordered a NY Strip steak at a cost of $20. I was served a thin, flat and tough piece of meat being passed off as a NY strip steak.  It didn't resemble a NY Strip at all. As a matter of fact, the runner announced it as a ribeye steak as he delivered it to me.  As I questioned the piece of meat, the manager and the server kept insisting this flat, thin and tough meat was indeed a strip steak. 

As I waited for a genuine NY strip steak, everyone in my party finished their meals. Finally, I did receive a NY Strip Steak that looked and tasted like a NY Strip Steak. Packed it up a left. 

The server Rylee was downright unpleasant. She was disagreeable and argumentative. 

Longhorn Steakhouse in Strongsville, Ohio should not be your destination for dinner or any celebratory event."}
{"text":"This was our first time here..... Was a bit skeptical at first. Everything was fabulous from the drinks (raspberry lemonade & raspberry tea)
to our bread, salad,(ranch dressing that they make there), and our entree and dessert! I ordered the 8 oz filet! The beat steak I have had in a long time! Also my daughter ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. Very tender on both meats, great flavors and awesome loaded baked potatoes! Had to have dessert, the chocolate molten lava cake is so worth it if you have room in your belly! Well worth the money!  Our waiter Josh was outstanding!!!! Will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Wow, great visit, first time at a LongHorn. Short wait early on a Saturday evening. Decor is strong but tasteful. Menu is well sorted, prices a notch or two above Outback, but not quite up there in the stuffy, snob zone.  Did the chili calamari as an app, blown away, tender and the seasoning was borderline hot, but didn't build up and distract. Salad was very simple, lots of well diced veggies, liberal dressing, but just a couple too many iceberg core sections in my bowl. Steak was pretty good, well trimmed, not overly seasoned, cooked to order. Enjoyed my steamed broccoli side and the warm bread was perfect. My wide the the salmon and felt it wasn't quite the freshest, but that's the expected complaint when she doesn't grill it herself. Service was impeccable and we enjoyed the visit and will do this again."}
{"text":"Decent food, however waiter was pretty rude. Unattentive and when I ordered a salad I got potato soup?! Not really a bad switch but it'd be nice to get what I order"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had the best dining experience at Longhorn. Our waitress Christina was fabulous, our drinks and our food were delicious. Everything from the bread to the salads to the steaks was perfectly prepared. Cold stuff was cold and hot stuff was hot and everything was very flavorful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and had a wonderful experience.   This was our first time to a LongHorn Steakhouse and everything was great.   I ordered the 8 oz sirloin with loaded baked potato, house salad and the Silver Patron Margarita.   Husband had the Prime Rib sandwich and iced tea.   We did have a small problem with my salad but the food server and manager took care of the situation.    I will be back to this location soon.  Good service, good food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with another couple. Their food came and my salad didn't. Was told it's right on it's way out. 20 minutes later still no salad. It's a salad, not some elaborate meal. Finally came and you could tell it was thrown together. Maybe a teaspoon of tomato and blue cheese. Way over priced for what you get. Never once did the manager come over to the table even after the server asked me if she had been by."}
{"text":"Michael W. was a great server. He was very attentive and efficient. Our drinks, bread and salads came out right on time. Flo's filet with blue cheese encrusted and a baked potato, butter and sour cream. It all was cooked to perfection. I almost could cut my steak with a fork as it was that tender. I topped it off with a Great Lakes Commodore Perry. Awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"If you're going out for a steak or seafood, I would not recommend this place. The steaks are tiny (the filet's are literally cut in half, no thickness at all) the lobster tails are the smallest I've ever encountered, seriously about 4-bites. The service was ok at best. I'm giving them two stars because one of the people in our party of eight ordered a burger and said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"went to the Longhorn at Metrocenter last night and my wife ordered a Filet.  Server brought out something else.  I got the Renegade Sirloin.  I think I even got something other than what I ordered.  The food was cooked great and the service was good, but I don't appreciate being charged for something I didn't order.  May go back, but it will be a while.  You have to get the \"taste\" out of your mouth, first, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Took my mom here last night for a late  Mother's Day! She was so pleased with her food (chopped steak and lobster tail) and my food was cooked to perfect! I love coming here for holidays and birthdays, but my mom has never been here. she was very impressed ! Our waiter was very kind and attentive and our glasses were never empty. Would 100% return to this location!"}
{"text":"I like this place for many reasons the changing menu... food variety. But the quality is so inconsistent I don't even think any other place is this inconsistent with food.. I don't think any meal I've had here has actually been hot. It's always room temp or straight up cold.. and the service is by far one of the worst I've ever had .. and almost every time  I go it's the same thing. It's sad because it's an affordable steakhouse that's local and not many to choose from. I'm a server and I always put them first over everything I know how it is and I always have their back.. but at this place.. I cant have their back.. they are that oblivious ..  maybe it's just the servers I get .. who knows. But every time .."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Definitely got a better steak at this location than I have some really expensive steakhouses. The service was stupendous as well! Our server Katelyn P. was super nice and funny! Would visit again!"}
{"text":"We went last night on Friday at about 4:20 pm. Was a lot of seniors rushing in, but we were seated immediately. Our server was quick with drink orders, bread, menus, etc. This was our first time and I liked it very much. The sweet chili calamari was spicy and good, classic martini was perfect. Salads were good. I had the filet/lobster and my filet was as perfect as it gets-medium rare with the blue cheese crust on top. I asked for a little bit less seasoning on the steak as I understood that they have a pretty strong seasoning and it came perfect for me. The lobster was more like a large crayfish and it was good ,but for $28 what can you expect? The only reason I didn't give this place five stars was that I asked for a glass of house red, and I don't know what brand it was but it didn't taste good at all. Next time I'll ask for the wine list. Hubby was not happy because he felt the ribs we make it home were better than what he got yesterday. I think he would've been better off ordering a steak. He also complained that the place was too noisy, however I don't have an issue with that because I have hearing aids that I can adjust for noisy situations. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to steakhouse in Madison because I have always have a pleasant experience and their steaks are delicious. I've always been greeted warmly by the staff and seated quickly. Meals arrived correctly and in a timely manner. The waitstaff was appropriately attentive - not too much and not too little. Their cocktails are so tasty and decently priced - they have a full bar! I would suggest the watermelon margarita for a nice summer treat (they pour you a glass and give you the rest in the shaker so it seems like you get two margaritas!) Each steak comes with a salad *and* a choice of side, with upgrades available for both. 

I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about because I have never had an issue here and I have been coming here for nearly 5 years. I came here once right after a stabbing (mentally unwell patron) and the staff still seated us quickly and was attentive! What other restaurant can say that!"}
{"text":"I had the best meal, steak with a lobster tail... everything was perfect, my waitress was awesome"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting one of the LongHorn locations. The ambiance is western, casual steak house and there were a wide variety of clients presents (ie. families, couples, all ages).The crew was super friendly and worked well as a team to serve the customers. There was no wait time for us when we arrived (around 530pm) and we were served rather quickly. The complimentary bread was delicious and our caesar salads were fresh. I ordered a sirloin medium, which came out pretty well done. However, my fiancé ordered a ribeye medium which was perfectly cooked. The sweet potato and mashed potatoes were great side dishes. The portions are good sizes and we ended up taking left overs home. The prices are a little on the higher end ($$-$$$) but this is typical for steak joints."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Place was a little messy, but it was busy. The steak was excellent perfectly done and hot. Very good beef. Otherwise the ambience is just aok. But if u r looking for a good tasting steak that is reasonable priced...Longhorn."}
{"text":"Good food ,Great service!   Great service from the moment we entered until we left. The server was pleasant very attentive. Our order was exactly as we ordered and we all enjoyed steaks, salads and side dishes. We will return when we go to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We just left. We came here to celebrate Mother's Day. The food was good but the service (by the waitress) was abysmal. The hostess and manager were very kind but our waitress was blatantly rude, especially towards my mom...on Mother's Day. She practically rolled her eyes at my mom for taking too much time to order when in reality she wasn't taking that log, she was deciding which salad to get with her meal. My husband had a bug in his salad (may have flown in while on table we don't know, not blaming the kitchen) and so the manager came over and replaced it which was nice. Our waitress referenced the bug again while we were eating our entrees, which was not appetizing. She didn't clear the salads when the entrees came and she generally had an attitude and seemed disinterested in our experience. She literally just placed the check on our table and walked away. No \"I hope you had a nice time\" no \"thanks for dining with us\" etc. just dropped it and walked off (she didn't have anything else in her hands to drop off so it's not like she was just busy). When she brought the check back after I paid she again said nothing. No thank you or hope you enjoyed it or anything. SO RUDE. I thought maybe she would redeem herself from how she treated my mother at the beginning but she didn't and so unfortunately my tip had to reflect this (I normally always tip 20%). I would not eat here again unless I was guaranteed not to have this waitress.  If it's Mother's Day weekend, you might want to be nice to MY MOM. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here since everywhere else was closed on Easter and we needed a place to watch the first baseball game of the season. (Which reminds me, I should probably write an angry review about how slow Comcast is to hook people's cable up around here...)

It's a chain steakhouse with a Texas vibe, forgettable overall.  The husband got a steak and fries which he deemed \"good.\"  (There's a reason he's not on yelp...)  I had a salmon caesar salad with way too much dressing, but the salmon was perfectly cooked.  Everything was quite expensive, with meals starting around $15.

I don't think that we would come back.  I would rate this place around 2.5--rounded up for the excellent service (even though we sat at the bar and didn't drink) and being open on a major holiday."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Its been a while since we've gone to LONGHORN and and this trip might encourage us to drop in more frequently.  We arrived  in the evening but still the tail end of  a weekday happy hour, the place was bustling but not packed. We strolled in just after a larger party came in but luckily 10+ can't fit in a single booth so we were sat within minutes !!  The servers were all pretty much running around but not \"in the weeds\" .  I will say while I don't think our server was strongest server on the floor, she got it done and didn't miss anything and we didn't have to wait for anything. I had prime rib cooked med  and the other half had rib-eye.  Both were brought out by the runner smoking hot and done dead on medium !!  (yay)  The cuts of meat were excellent with minimal to no cast offs left on the plates.  Of course the meals come with salads and free bread,  but who wants to read about that when you're a meat eater !!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, my new favorite place !!
The Ribs are to die for, and the shrimp appetizer thingy is unreal good !!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the menu is diverse. Prices are good for the abundance of food you receive."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to longhorn. We arrived at 640 and left around 830. There were 3 of us. For being this time of night we expected it to be slightly busy, but it wasn't at all. Our server was Antoinette. We waited approximately 10 minutes for our beverages. Our appetizer came out cold after 20 minutes like it had been pulled out of the window and sat for a little while. We then placed our dinner order. It was around 700. I noticed a friend of mine across the restaurant had just arrived. We just were able to place our dinner order. At 720, we received our salads. My friend already had their meal! I ordered my steak medium and so did my fiance. We waited another 15 minutes after our salads for our meal. Once again, my friend was already paying their bill and leaving. My steak came out rare and so did my fiances. He can eat his like that, I cannot. Our server disappeared quite a bit. She only had 3 tables. Only saw who we suspected to be a manager when our food was dropped off. Was looking for one as we were leaving but could not find anyone besides the bartender, not even the host at the door. Our bill was over $90 for 2 adults and 1 child! Probably won't be back because this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I'm with Micah that this place is a chain, so you can't expect fine dining.  That said, the filet that 3 of us ordered at the table was cooked to the level at which we ordered it.  Which shockingly, is very hard to find these days.  The steak was cooked medium and the outside was not charred, which usually is a sign of cooking at the right temperature versus just burning the outside at high heats and then moving it off the heat.

Pleasantly surprised, and the margaritas were big and good. 

I'd eat here again, which is saying a lot, haha!"}
{"text":"+ Medium sounds good for health, but can be tough to chew for the middle part of steak
+ outlaw ribeye rocks, but central part (in medium-done) can be tough. 
- Flo's Fillet doesn't tastes that well.. But it's pretty good for lean beef. 
- Outlaw ribeye has 18oz, 1000 calories (60+fat, 90+protein) in total (whereas 10oz Filet: 480, 20 fat, 60 protein), be careful about this large portion served. Don't blame yourself for it.

+ Sweet potato. Always like this back in childhood. 
+ Server's pretty nice
- (paying) Splitting a sharing item is weird here. Do they just don't do half-half split?

For Potato IDK, for other type of steaks I don't know. Overall not too bad, but I probably won't drive to marketplace simply for Longhorn.

{"text":"I hate being the person that walks into a restaurant so close to closing but I took a chance and am glad I did.  40 minutes to close Megan the hostess greeted us with a very friendly smile and showed is to our table. Hayley then took amazing care of us. Making sure to tend to our needs and providing amazing service. As a first timer to Longhorn I am extremely pleased and will definitely be back as I live right down the street."}
{"text":"45 minutes for a soup and salad--really!! Waitress was excellent and I think she knew there was a problem. Whole kitchen staff should be fired!!!"}
{"text":"I hate complaining but my wife wasn't liking her steak and mine seemed thin. We mentioned this to the server and he recommended talking to the manager. The manager was very courteous and explained well why mine was thin very well. He traded my wife's steak out with great speed. The server was very nice and deserved the good tip."}
{"text":"Food is OK. They tend to overcook the burgers so adjust accordingly. Service has been fantastic every time I have been there (usually under duress) but I care fuck-all about that. 

You won't be disappointed here but you won't be thrilled either."}
{"text":"First time there from out of town.never again,ordered med rare p.rib,came rare,they cook it back,flopped it on the grill to darken it,the taste of oil was to much,they didnt charge me so i ate salad and bread.My ladies meal was good she said,ordered 1side lobster tail,waitress forgot all about it,so 15min,later she brings it at no charge, stunk and was rubbery but free. The manager did offer a new meal,but when ur ladies done eating do u want to wait another 20,,no ,,,,drinks were good,draft beer ice cold,the glass explay cases above us were dirty and nasty.not apart of there cleaning,,,We will try again in our home town,but not this one."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have enjoyed the steaks here especially the prime rib. On this visit we ordered a ribeye and prime rib sandwich. The ribeye has tremendous flavor but wasn't as tender as it had been on previous visits. The prime rib sandwich wasn't anything to write home about. The flavor was fine but not over the top. It's still one of our favorite steak houses to frequent in this price range."}
{"text":"What a great Steak is all i can say, served just as ordered by a friendly staff and a very attentive manager.  We were early for lunch on a quiet Monday and really couldn't have asked for more.  Everyone ordered steak and everyone was happy.  Good drinks, great staff and super atmosphere, highly recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Longhorn Steakhouse has snuck into the #2 steakhouse in the Champaign-Urbana area for me. It's a new spot and the decor and atmosphere is open and exciting. I really like the food (they had a lobster, bacon and cheddar baked potato that was the truth), but the wait staff was understaffed and the drinks were on the pricey side. I definitely want to see what else they have to offer...more to come."}
{"text":"Longhorn is another one of those chain restaurants that is hit or miss depending on the location and the time of day you eat.

This particular day I went for lunch. I unfortunately ordered the macaroni and cheese... It was an over seasoned disaster.

Need hamburger for the kids was also very underwhelming. The melted cheese smelled so bad we had to return it.

The lunch options are not great... Dinner in the past has been better at Longhorn for me. What they're lacking is quality and consistency on a regular basis.

I think outback is a better choice"}
{"text":"Our original intention was to go to Texas Land and Cattle, but apparently it has closed down. We headed off down Harris Boulevard in search of something else to satisfy a desire for steak. Since I-85 is such a hassle with rush-hour traffic and now all that construction, we decided not to endure more of that and not trek further for a Texas Roadhouse steak. Passing the highway on-ramp, we remembered Longhorn's existed. I used to live in the area and had been a there a few times before, years and years ago.

We both ordered steaks, my friend the NY Strip and I -- my preferred cut -- the ribeye. We got our drinks and bread the same time as the side salads. My tea was a bit bitter, the side salad was decent but bland. I prefer other place's blue cheese dressing to Longhorn's. This place's was a bit watered down.

The steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.

Everyone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.

As for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \"okay.\"

As the star rating and the server said, it was all \"okay.\" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else's idea and they had the desire for it. Also, my friend paid, so it's tough to beat that."}
{"text":"Tried Longhorn for the first time last night. Will not go back. With so many other great choices in this area of Phoenix/Chandler I'm afraid with the quality of food and service we received last night that this place won't last long.

We went to Longhorn around 9:00pm on a Sunday which understandably is a little late for a Sunday night dinner and the restaurant closed at 10 but that still does not justify poor service. We were seated right away but in the busy middle section of the restaurant. With so many open tables in other areas of the restaurant (I know they are trying to keep it to one service area) but it was very loud in the this area and felt very stuffy for a late night dining experience. It did not help that about 10 minutes after arriving one of the waitresses started a pretty loud mini vacuum that was extremely distracting to dinner conversation and many patrons seemed very displeased that she was vacuuming around our tables while we were trying to enjoy dinner. Our waitress never introduced herself once and seemed in a huge rush the entire time we were having dinner. I ordered a skinny wild berry sangria first off and it was horrible! It tasted like pure corn syrupy berry jam. I have never had a sangria made with syrup in the first place, it should be made with fresh fruit even at a chain restaurant. Horrible first impression. Our waitress did take that off of the bill but never apologized and never offered to bring me something different and never suggested a different option.

Our food was worse. I had a sirloin with portabello sauce cooked medium. The portabello sauce came just plopped on top but not melted at all, it just looked like a congealed blob of goo. Yuck. I scraped that off and cut in to the steak. It was very fatty and more like medium well. The meat itself was very bland and not well seasoned. My fiance had a stuffed filet filled with white cheddar and bacon. It was not stuffed at all. It was once again a congealed blob of goo on top of the steak. His steak had a much better flavor and probably the only reason I gave this review two stars but it was still extremely fatty for a filet. Dry baked potato, overcooked noodles in mac and cheese and out of green beans. Boo. I could just see Gordan Ramsey sitting down for a \"trial\" of the food at this place and saying WHAT IS THAT?!? at the weird blob of fatty goo they called sauce. 

Do not eat here. You have many other great options in the area. Outback has much better quality of meat at a lower price, Z'Tejas is an amazing Southwest option right next door and around the same price and Roy's is pretty expensive but well worth it and also right next door."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this place for years and finally got the opportunity. The place is nice inside and the staff was on point. This place is wayyyy better  than outback. The menu had so many things to choose and everything looked great. Our food was awesome and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great price however we left because we were sitting there 10-15 minutes and had no service. A group came after us and had service. We told the hostess when we left that no one came to help us and he said \"really\" but didn't try and fix the issue. Not going back."}
{"text":"Longhorn has always seemed to put me in good spirits. Luckily I have a partner that loves this place because it's the bomb. Good ppl and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I've been fairly faithful to Texas Roadhouse but tonight I cheated on them. I'm glad I did because Longhorn was much better. Went on a Saturday night only had a 15 min wait so that was good. Place was clean and well decorated, employees friendly and attentive. My favorite part was my flat iron steak cooked medium. It was super juicy, tender and flavorful. I enjoyed the marinade so much that I was licking my plate clean!!! I think we are gonna come back next weekend because I can't stop thinking about my dinner from tonight."}
{"text":"This LongHorn Steakhouse is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. My husband and I have dined here several Sunday afternoons when we were craving a delicious steak. Service has ranged from average to good. The food has always been excellent though! I always say that I'm going to have \"just one\" slice of that amazing Honey Wheat bread and then I end up eating half of a loaf. I love the 9 oz Flo's Filet Steak, cooked Medium Rare. Delicious! I'm sure we'll be back soon when we have another steak craving."}
{"text":"This was the second time we had gone and both times we ordered the porter house for two.  The first time was absolutely perfect but this time it was much smaller, although it was delicious!   It was a $40 steak dinner so they really shouldn't skimp.  On the plus side,  I ordered the cheesecake with banana rum sauce and it was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"LongHorn is one of those places - not fancy, nothing mind-blowing but they're consistently good. I always get good service and the food is always tasty and filling. Tonight's togo was half rack of ribs, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and salad. Ribs were good and fall-off-the-bone; sides were good. Only problem was I asked for two sides of ranch and the togo ramekins had barely any dressing in them. It was almost comical. But - it was a filling dinner!"}
{"text":"The reason I'm writing this review is the server Jesus, was horrible. He not once came to our table to see if we needed anything until he gave us the bill, ordered FF asked for catsup, he never bought it my friend had to get up and go to the servers door and ask for it, we had to ask for EVERYTHING We WANTED WHEN HE PASSED THE TABLE AS HE NEVER STOPPED---when we asked for something he acted like it was a hardship for him( man did u forget ur a server) when we placed our orders he was preoccupied looking toward the door like what, did not introduce self just a slow terrible experience.  Why does Longhorn advertise happy hour and there is none!!! The drinks are 8-10 dollars and taste like fruit punch we will not go back, my chicken was dry, the salad was brown and wilted with dressing swimming at the bottom of the bowl.  I will not go back!! Poor service and drinks with next to no alcohol. Why do you charge that much for a drink and why do you falsely advertise happy hour? Very disappointed.  We left him a tip for service. Would not even give a star this visit but no choice"}
{"text":"I had to start writing this review before I even ordered my food because I just can't get past the awful sour smell that hit me as soon as I walked into this place. It was prevalent throughout the entire restaurant. Honestly, it smelled like sour moldy laundry that someone had left in the washing machine for too long. I just can't believe that the staff doesn't smell this. Or maybe they have gotten used to it. In any event it's a really bad first impression especially when you are about to have food. Hopefully the food will be better."}
{"text":"Ok, first things first: Ask for Maverick as your server. You will not be disappointed. Maverick was friendly, funny (but not forced and fake) and professional. Secondly, order the lamb chops (available for a limited time). They were tender and delicious. My sons ordered the Outlaw Ribeye and Flo's Filet. They thoroughly enjoyed them as well as the seasoned fries. Generous portions, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere- can't go wrong. Only 1 recommendation: please PLEASE wipe down the salt and pepper (all containers). They were very sticky."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I will give this place a second chance.  Too many things happened wrong to give more than a 3 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting friends in the area, and visited this location.  I've eaten at other LongHorn locations, so knew what to expect - a really good choice of steaks, fish, chicken and good sides - comfortable, family-friendly atmosphere.  And from that aspect, we were not disappointed - the food was great for the most part. 

I had the 12 oz ribeye, medium rare and it was perfect!  One of the better steaks I've had in a while. I splurged on the baked potato, and again - it was the perfect texture and balance of toppings.  Salads were cold and crisp, and our fried green tomato appetizer was also done perfectly - I like the drizzle of sauce and goat cheese topper on a bed of lettuce.  Nicely done! Friends ordered the smaller filets (to me, they looked a little flat, but my friends enjoyed it), and my husband ordered the chopped steak with everything on the side and no seasoning - he likes to taste the meat. He was disappointed.  the meat was a tight grind, and was clearly pan fried, not grilled. Everything else was great.  And we all had leftovers. 

Where they fell down on this trip was service.  I'm a very forgiving customer - I recognize that servers can be impacted by a slow kitchen, or big parties, or a myriad of things that are not within their control.  And if I can tell they are hustling, and trying to make a difference, then they still get a big tip. However - that's not what was happening.  It was Saturday night - busy, but no wait.  We were seated promptly, and given menus, but it was at least 10 minutes before our server appeared and another 5 minutes before we were given our teas and water.  The server \"A\" was very nice, but seemed to lack confidence and we had to ask him to repeat himself a few times.  Once we ordered, we received our appetizer and salads timely.  

I will give this location a lot of kudos - three of the four of us had special orders (hold this, extra this, put this on the side), and they didn't flinch, and even checked on us a couple of times to make sure things were to our liking.  And - they got it right.   But the chopped steak came out several minutes after the other meals.  They also lost a point that they mixed up two of our plates - and it wasn't until we took a bite that we realized it.  We're good friends, so we just switched plates, but in a different situation, it would have been really awkward. After dinner, it took a LONG time to bring us the boxes for leftovers and then they didn't come by to pick up the dirty dishes - even after we paid the tab.  That's a big no-no in my book. 

So will we be back - probably.  But I hope management gives their team members a little more coaching.  Because overall the food was good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and I thought I was going to have a good meal.  The bread was good and my salad looked good until I found a bug in it that was laying on its back with it's legs still moving.  All they did was offer to replace my salad.  Needless to say, I was utterly disgusted and found myself looking through my entree to make sure there wasn't another bug anywhere in it.  I had the filet stuffed with fontina and mushrooms.  Had I not been so worried about finding another bug in my food, I probably would have thoroughly enjoyed the steak because it actually tasted really good, but after the salad my meal was ruined."}
{"text":"Craving a hearty meal and my husband always talks up the Longhorn he used to go to in Ohio. The broiler seemed to be too hot as everything came out burnt on the top. They gave the toddler crayons and that was a win, but the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Always consistent and good. Ribeye, burger and tilapia cooked perfectly. Still excellent value after all these years. Y'all come."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a couple days ago. I had a hamburger with fries. It was good, well seasoned but a bit dry. 
The waiter seemed distracted when I first got there and thought maybe he was busy but there wasn't a lot of customers there at the time. 

Towards the middle of my meal he did check in on me but my glass soon was empty with no waiter in sight. 

He did finally stop by and fill my water glass but I was at the end of my meal. However, he did offer me a water to go. 

Overall, I had a good experience here but I just thought the burger would taste a lot better. 
I think I would go back and try a steak, by just the seasoning on the burger. 

I will say the place was clean, staff friendly- even my waiter became friendly half way thru my service.... maybe he was busy. Who knows. 
Again, I would give it another try!"}
{"text":"My in-laws wanted to go to this restaurant and wanted steak. I was skeptical given the chain style restaurant. It was extremely busy on an early Saturday evening. That was good sign. We were seated earlier than promised and waited on promptly and with an energetic and friendly staff. The prices are in line with good, quality food. The onion petals style \"Texas Tonion\" appetizer was just ok. Nothing exciting but the roasted white cheddar cheese stuffed mushrooms were very good. The white balsamic dressing on the house salad made an ok salad very good and all the steaks orders were outstanding. We had everything from the \"Flow's Fillet to the \"Outlaw Ribeye\"s. The flavor and seasoning made it worth every penny. I loved having the option of spaghetti squash as a side dish for an additional $1.99. 
The waiter recommended the \"Chocolate Stampede \" chocolate cake dessert to share. I'm not a chocolate cake admirer. But This thing was HUGE and amazing. Six types of chocolate with vanilla bean ice cream. They said it s raves two for $9.99 but it easily served 4. I could have mad myself sick eating it tho because it was hard to say \"enough\". 
I'd have no problem going back."}
{"text":"I didn't expect this! The food was amazing. Seriously, it's a chain, food is typically average nothing that makes you go wow but this was really really good. Onion petals were not hot but heck the main course was rock solid. The kids  ordered chicken tenders and sirloin steak. The portions were huge and tasted great. A lot of places make crappy kids meals (I'm talking about you Chili's) but this was awesome. My filet was perfectly cooked and tasted great. I had a side of asparagus. Lots of attention grabbing western memorabilia to entertain anyone."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations and was great for the price. I got the prime rib which was very tender and juicy. I'd definitely recommend getting mushrooms and onions with any meal - they give you A LOT and it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not often compelled to review chains, but I have some thoughts on this Longhorn. For starters, it's always busy. Like. Always. Busy. I've even driven by on some holidays and seen every parking spot full. Despite the crowds, the staff here do a great job keeping things moving, from the hostess stand to the meal. The service is always fast and the servers are always really nice people.

Also, I want to point out, that on all my visits in recent memory, I've seen patrons nearby excessively complain about their food in the attempt, I'm assuming, to get it for free. Is this a thing now?! But for real, this Longhorn knows what they're doing. My steak is always cooked right and the salmon salad is always satisfying and what I expect. I just can't believe when I hear people in here complaining about the food. Seriously?!

The only reason I don't give 5-stars is that there are some odd two-seater booths on the sides of the restaurant with unmovable seating and table that need updating. If you're tall, these are a nightmare for you. Every now and then, they'll try to seat me and my Mom here (we're both tall, we're literally crammed in there) but are always nice when we ask for a different table. 

Overall, sometimes you're just in the suburbs and need a steak. This Longhorn passes the test with flying colors!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to stop in here for lunch over the weekend because we had a gift card.  Since it was lunchtime, we decided to order an appetizer and a salad each.  We started with the Wild West Shrimp.  It comes fried and served with various peppers and ranch dressing.  To some, the shrimp may have been overcooked but I don't like my shrimp crunchy so they were perfect for me.  I didn't see a salad that really piqued my interest so I went with a boring Chicken Caesar Salad.  And yes, it was boring.  Nothing too special about it and it definitely wasn't the best caesar salad I've had.  The hubs went with the 7-Pepper Sirloin Salad and said it was just okay for him as well.  The staff was friendly and on top of the service.  Overall, an average visit on a Saturday afternoon.  I will definitely return for a steak dinner one day."}
{"text":"As you can see from my previous review we used to love this place, especially the outlaw steak and the Crusted chicken Parm meal.  However, we found out the hard way that things have changed a while ago.  We had gone back for the outlaw (we used to visit about once or twice a month) but it was tough and lacked flavor.  We were told that the whole kitchen had walked out and the replacements were scrambling to get up to speed so we didn't return for a long time, tonight (about 6 months later). We had hoped everything would be back to normal. Not even close.  
Service:
My husband was asking a few questions about different items and then about the price of the squash but there were two different prices on the menu so he asked what the price was for what he wanted. The waiter interrupts my husband and says, \"how about you just let us buy you the squash?\"  He said this repeatedly until Mike just said yep, k... and fell silent.  (There was a family celebrating a birthday near us, he didn't want to make a scene and ruin their experience).  I was in shock, utter shock.  I didn't miss the waiter's intentions with that comment nor did I perceive the tone of voice incorrectly.  He thought the questions were petty and didn't have the time nor feel it was necessary to answer the questions about pricing.  I ordered the chicken parm meal with no questions. The waiter left to serve others and place our order.
I was upset and not happy that my husband had chosen not to say anything.  I love him. He works hard for his money, every day.  He has every right to ask about the price of items he wishes to purchase.  So, I went to the front desk and privately asked to speak to the manager, thus avoiding the waiter the embarrassment of having a discussion about his behavior in front of other customers. I didn't want a scene, didn't want further attitude.  I asked the manager to please wait until we had left to have a discussion with the waiter, again giving him and us the opportunity to avoid an uncomfortable evening. 
The manager while listening to me says, \"yeah for sure\" when I tell him that my man has every right to ask about prices.  He said those words a few times actually but not once did he apologize. Not once. He's young...not really an excuse but maybe experience is lacking in his case.  The previous manager and staff were excellent, the one time we had an issue before the kitchen walked out and was replaced.
So a few minutes go by, I've calmed down and am sitting at the table with my husband and daughter.  The table next to us is full of the family celebrating a young mans birthday.  The young man sees the waiter and asks about an item he had requested a while ago.  The waiter replies, \"I only have two hands\" and as the kid was still trying to speak with him the waiter walks away into the kitchen.  They stared in shock and said nothing.  
The food:
While the chicken meal was still great, the outlaw was not what it should have been.  My husband ordered a medium-well steak, he was served a well-done steak.  (okay so one small area of the giant steak had a SLIGHT bit if pink, but that was it).  He mentions this and the waiter asks, so what do you want me to do, were you wanting a steak with more pink, do you want me to...on and on the condescending questions went ...uum yes.  I asked for a medium well steak, this is well done. It can't be 'fixed' a new steak needs to be prepared. You can't put it back on the grill to uncook it.  He has my husband remove the side that is on the plate, and takes the steak away.  Once it is brought back, it is the right done-ness however lacks the flavor, like they forgot the rub or spices they use?  We didn't complain anymore. He just wanted to eat and leave.  He worked all day without a meal and it was nearly 8 pm now. The bill arrives, and no credit, no apology. McDonalds does a better job at customer service. 

The waitress at the bar was pleasant, quick and she was a heck of a lot busier than our waiter."}
{"text":"Disappointing. While we came at a busy time we knew we wait to be seated. 
The food was bland. Not nearly as good as normal,  almost like the guys in the kitchen didn't care.  My husband asked for his steak butterflied, it wasn't.  My was so dry it was like jerky, odd for a streak that was supposed to be medium. Did I mention it was flavorless. Asked for some love sauce, got it when there were only a few pieces left. 
Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trouble & stay away from this restaurant!!! We are new visitors to Phoenix & wanted to try a local steakhouse. We arrive & there are several guests waiting to be seated & at least half of the tables were empty. Host proceeds to tell us we have at least an hour wait!!! When I asked why there was a long wait with so many open tables I was told that they were short staffed. Poor management when scheduling a staff!!! We saw 3 parties leave as we were leaving. Loss of sales, but more importantly a loss reputation!!!"}
{"text":"I have to really give it up to this place, for a chain, their steaks were pretty darn good. I had their New York strip with their baked potato and seasoned rice pilaf. I was pretty happy with the meal. They some pretty tasty bread too, which is unlimited! So bring on the carbs! We didn't have room for dessert, so that will have to happen next time. Our waitress was friendly and quick. She was on top of our drinks and made sure we were never empty. For what this place is, it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"I remember when this use to be the go to place.  The rebuilt was wonderfully done.  There has obviously been a management change.  For the second time, our steaks were tasteless and inedible.  First Feb. 14th, which we pass off as the \"Valentine Rush\" , then again this pass weekend.

My husband's steak came out rare.  Very rare.  He ordered it medium.  Sent it back, which was a big deal for him to do since he usually just about eats anything.  They nuked it and brought it back out.  No comments nothing.  My filet and lobster were tasteless.  Seriously.  No flavor.  

Spoke to the waitress who apologized and asked if we would care to order dessert.  No, didn't want to waste anymore money.  Went home to Lotus for coffee and dessert.  Expected better.

1/16/2015 Update. Contacted Corporate which gave us a $50 gift card.  Went to Longhorn in Huntersville.  EXCELLENT.  Quality of steak MUCH better.  Talk to the manager.  Wonderful lady.  Will not be going back to Gastonia until there is a change in managers or the quality of the food. And get this...we ate more for less.  Managers can set certain prices.  We paid a third less in Huntersville for more food.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Calamari was wonderful. Steaks cooked correctly with lovely flavor."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with friends. We were a group of 7 and the had a round table in the back. We were off by ourselves, which was nice. They have nice variety of lunch choices and combinations. I had the French onion soup and a sweet potato. The potato was huge and hot!! It was moist and soft. The butter and cinnamon was served on the side. I took half of it home. The soup was served hot (both came at the same time on one plate). It was a little salty but that's to be expected. Another friend got the lunch size salad and it was a big portion. The chicken sandwich looked appetizing. Would recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 stars except it didn't go above and beyond my expectations. When I first entered I thought we had just entered a retirement home chow. Not that the place didn't look nice but it wasn't anything special and the crowd did look like they just unloaded from a retirement home bus. But the staff was very friendly, the food was great-my filet with cheddar and bacon was tender even though I had to have it well done and the veggies I ordered were crisp and fresh! Seating was comfy and the food arrived super fast! I'd never not been able to finish my salad before the main course. For a pregnant woman this was a dream! And the bill was nothing to gasp over. Next time I'd come here dressed more casual ready for a decent steak or a good drink. Not a whole lot of entertainment there so this is a place to visit with friends or family. We were done with our meal and paid for in almost exactly and hour."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I normally don't give 5 stars to chain steakhouses like this, but the bartender's service after a poor experience across the street tonight made the difference. 

Hakim was awesome! He provided great, friendly, and attentive service. I told him about my horrible experience at the Tilted Kilt across the way of waiting over 10 minutes of never being acknowledged or waited on at the bar. I was only going to have a small order of wings there, but thanks to Hakim's hospitality I went all in on a big juicy steak. 

My ribeye was cooked perfectly and tasted great. I had a couple of special requests with my salad and he was extremely accommodating. 

A big Thank You and job well done to Hakim and Longhorn!"}
{"text":"The staff was AWESOME!!!  Our first time here.  Steak was great!!  My husband and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best big chain steak house. We hit this spot as a general go-to when we can't decide on something. Service is usually good. Nicole is always on point. The food never disappoints for the price. A couple hiccups tonight but Mike the manager was quick to the rescue and totally took care of us. Thanks Mike and crew! Good luck on the rest of a hella busy weekend!"}
{"text":"First came here for the Yelp event and had an awesome time and decided to give this place another go.  Every employee we came in contact with was genuinely nice and fun but the food is the reason its only getting 3 stizzars.  They have a pretty good happy hour which I was told was honored in the whole restaurant, not just the bar area (which is annoying to relegate it to one small area ).  They have beer, drink and some app specials but really no signs telling you what the deals actually are on food, just drinks.  All draft beers for 3.00 is great but there was only 4 to choose from.  No biggie.  I also like that they dont make ya feel like Karl Childers in Slingblade when you ask what the specials are.  We ordered steaks with salads and sides.  The slads came out and were so wet we couldnt even eat them.  Maybe a salad spinner?  When the steaks came out they were swimming in a pool of grease.  Guess a steak restaurant never heard of resting a steak before plating?  I actually had to ask for a new plate it was that bad.  Now between sending back almost full salads and asking for a new plate because of the grease moat for my steak a manager would of swung by?  Wrong...  He was getting liquor order in and seemed preoccupied.  For what we ended up spending on 2 meals and beers, its not worth it for me.  Also, they dont have any local beers and the \"micros\" they do have they keep on ice behind the bar?  That kind of daily temperature change in beer (warm/cold/warm/cold) to unsold beers will ruin them.  But im sure beer selection and storage come from a corporate level (I hope not the bar manager).  So, for the price they charge for food here I would hope the kitchen would get it together.  They should ask \"would I eat this?\" before sending it out to paying customers."}
{"text":"Just got into town and decided I needed a steak. Waited an hour and 20 minutes for a salad and then the bartender tells us dinner is 2 hours behind.  Girl next to me has tried to cancel her order for 45 minutes manager can't figure out how to refund her. I love Longhorn but this might be the worst run restaurant I have ever been to. To be fair I eat dinner out 200 days a year"}
{"text":"7/7
I'm a LongHorn fan but this experience wasn't one of the best.  It seemed unusually dark in the restaurant.  The server was really friendly but didn't want to bring a knife out for the bread!  It was weird!  He told us to use the one with our silverware and when we asked for a bread knife (please!), he said it would squish the bread, \"..but if (we) wanted one, he'd bring what (we) wanted...\"  Like he was doing some big favor and we'd be sorry kind of thing.  Just weird, like I said.

Both steaks we ordered were just WAY too peppery.  We each got a Renegade and my husband's was coated with black peppercorns.  The meat was well cooked but the seasoning was overboard.

On the upside, this location participates in the rewards program.  It's similar to the one that Fridays has where you collect points to earn free food.  Who doesn't love free food?  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was really good too.  It's the run of the mill chain steak house so not too exciting for me specifically but they did a really good job."}
{"text":"Service was still excellent, I ordered the outlaw ribeye my gf ordered the salmon. Both were cooked perfect and my steak was seasoned perfect. Thank you to the staff for giving us the gift card. We will deffinetly be back in the future. It must have been an off night before."}
{"text":"Always good Parmesan crusted chicken! The seasonal sweet potatoes were very good as well."}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse, I'm so glad I stopped by here for dinner! Perfect way to end my night! Food was amazing, my waitress was a sweet heart! Perfect restaurant!! Would definitely be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Longhorn steakhouse because the food is tasty, the selection is good, and the service is very attentive. We like the luncheon specials, plus they frequently have coupons for dessert and appetizers. Had dinner, and the ribs and the trout were outstanding."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, usually go for dinner. Food is great, takes a while to get your food but it's worth the wait. Is a little pricey, but the lunch combo is very reasonable. My favorite salad is the 7 Pepper Steak salad. The Perfect Margaritas are the bomb!"}
{"text":"We don't frequent this restaurant often but know it's a good place to fall back on for a great steak and meal. I ordered a filet medium rare and it came back well done. Unfortunately by the time I sent it back (which I rarely do but this was so over cooked i couldn't justify settling) my husband had already finished his meal. The manager was observant and comped us my meal when it came out. Was a little bit hard to enjoy as my husband was done, but the new steak was great and we were pleased with the response. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"So my wife and I tend not to frequent steakhouses because to be honest we can usually fix something better at home. We were looking for something a little different so we gave it a try and unfortunately it reaffirmed my commitment to just have steak at home. The rest of our experience was satisfactory, no big hiccups but the steak was awful. It was thicker on one side than the other (1/4\"?) which I'm pretty sure doesn't allow it to be cooked evenly. The \"Ribeye\" I was to get was unbelievably tough. Either they need to sharpen their knives or provide glue so the plate stays in one place as I attempt to saw through this ridiculously tough piece of meat. I ate it and didn't complain because if that's a sign of their quality of meat I don't think it would do any good to get another piece. The only other thing that irked me was my wife's meal coming out 5 minutes after mine. I'm pretty sure our server was in the weeds a bit but that is still no excuse with food runners. This location can do better however I would venture to guess if it wasn't on Prosect Ave, it would have a tough time surviving. For this grade of restaurant I think i'm going to have to stick with Texas Roadhouse and suck up the long drive west."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! She always gets the filet, and I do the sirloin with half rack of ribs. The steaks are always cooked perfectly and the sides and salads are great too! We like this place better than the Keg!"}
{"text":"They had opened and a friend and I went here to eat.  It was aweful  we were never acknowlege except for 2 in your party.  We over looked that, we got to the food it was awefull for the price was not even close for what we got.. I ordered a ribeye, I get a flat iron steak. 1/2 raw... I called upper mgmnt in Bloomington,Il.... Its almost been a year and still have yet to recieve my money back ...the phone call in return from mgnt.  was to blow me off. So now here s the blow back."}
{"text":"In general my husband and I enjoy eating at Longhorn. They have plenty of options and aren't crazy expensive. However, we will NOT be returning to this location! Worst experience ever! We decided to take family out to dinner. We had a party of 7 adults and one baby. They do not allow reservations but do call ahead seating, or so I thought. I called two different times to put my party on the waiting list since it was a Saturday at dinner time. Both times I called I was told they could do call ahead seating for a party of 7 or more and that it was first come first serve. We arrived and added our party to wait list for a 35 minute wait (not terrible for a Saturday at 6pm). So we waited. When we were seated, they sat us at a table/booth that sat 6 and added a extra chair and high chair to the end of the table. To say we were crowded is an understatement! When I asked to move to the empty three tables that had been pushed together right next to us, the hostess said that they were RESERVED for a party of 8 that had called ahead. I immediately requested to speak with the manager who said she was sorry and offered to have 2 people in my party go sit somewhere else once a table was free! Ridiculous!!!! We stayed where we were and ordered. Our server was fine, no issues at all with him. Our food was NOT. We ordered ribs that were so tough you couldn't even cut into them with a knife, we had undercooked chicken (pink in the middle), two of the steaks ordered medium came out very rare, and one of the baked potatoes was undercooked. We again spoke to the manager who apologized but offered to do nothing about the situation. So take caution when choosing this Longhorn. And if for some reason you still decide to eat here and have an issue, do not expect the manger ( a blonde lady) to do ANYTHING about it!!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away, host was very friendly and seemed to like his job. The food was OK, (mac and cheese was great), but stay away from the soup, not worth the upcharge. Waitress needs a lot more training in how to pretend to appreciate the fact that we went out of our way to stop and give Longhorn steakhouse and her our hard earned money. She was the most unfriendly person I have ever come across. Never once did she bother to smile or thank us.

  I know in this day and age you can't ask a lot out of people, but I have had better service at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for our anniversary not too long ago and had a good time.  Food was fast and came out hot!  It's your average chain steakhouse so no it won't blow your socks off."}
{"text":"Called in for the waitlist for two, but seemed to be useless. Waited for another 30 mins when arrived. No drinks served and nobody asked for ten mins after we were seated. No tableware even after the bread and salad came. The waitress was careless. We ordered two soups but not even one came even after we paid. My fault not to realized that earlier and paid for my mistake at last. The worst dinner experience of all time. Never come again."}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago and the service was badddddd they were rude and selfish the one girl was txt on her phone.. And I ask one of the young guy to wipe off the table and he took a paper towel and did it I was like eeeewwwww I bet his house is gross then the girl that bought are food out smell like hot sex lol idk.. Food is good here but not the service fuck that!!!"}
{"text":"Mushrooms and salad were amazing. What hurts is that longhorn is notorious for over cooking steak. I ordered a 10 ounce filet medium rare. 20 minutes later I'm asking myself where is my food. If i have to ask that for a medium rare steak it means the 2 guys back there went for a 14 minute smoke break. Filet comes out rock solid like a hockey puck. 0 pink. I look at the waitress like forget overcooked I'm concerned this isn't edible anymore. She shrugs me off. I ask the manager he says I can fix that. Forget about it. Don't offer medium rare if it's always well done."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed base on all the good reviews. The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min. Service was very slow and had to ask multiple times for bread and water. Hate to say this but Outback is MUCH better. Will probably never return or recommend to friends"}
{"text":"This rating could easily been a 4 or 5. It was a slow evening. Waited at door, No Hostess. Saw later she was also the Busser. I understand cross use if labor especially during slow nights, here is where Customer awareness rolls in. No manager on floor, bartender Not Busy. Customers waiting for the Greet. Thank Goodness the food was Good. (Maybe that's where the Manager was... In the kitchen) I hope so for Dardens sake. I was hungry so No Food Picture. As I said the saving grace was the Steak, cooked just the way I ordered it Medium rare. Salad was crisp, honey bread was nice and warm, tried the NEW Mint, Cucumber Lemonade which was delightful. Here's your Hint John, have them check the restrooms at least 1/2 hourly. It's important!"}
{"text":"One star for the waiter, who was completely mortified by the experience we had. Otherwise it would be zero stars. Took us 90 minutes for the two of us to get our food. Steaks were cremated (ordered medium), shrimp was cold and overcooked. Only thing we received that was salvageable were our loaded potatoes, which we got to go since we didn't feel like waiting anymore. But in a comical turn of events, even the to-go containers were shoddy and wouldn't close all the way. Wasn't  just us though. During our long stay here we witnessed multiple other tables receiving apologies and discounts, all the way up to as the door was closing as we were walking out. I feel bad and embarrassed for everybody that works here. I've never left a review like this in my life. Haven't sent back food anywhere since I can remember. We couldn't even speak to a manager because the poor guy was stuck back in the kitchen cooking food. I just can't even believe what just happened and it was like something out of a movie. Which is appropriate since we could have watched an entire movie in the time that we were there. I almost wish we had, since movie theater popcorn and gummy bears would have left us with more food in our stomachs than this Steakhouse did. Shocking experience to the point of almost being comical."}
{"text":"I must have been here about 5 times the past couple of months. (im preggo and I crave steak A LOT!)
First of, the service here is good. The servers are friendly and prompt.
I wish I remember the gal's name...She served us twice in a row already...

Last time we visited was last night for dinner. I ordered the Flo's Filet w/ rice pilaf  & my husband had ordered the porterhouse  w/ rice pilaf. With an extra side of Mac & Cheese.

We order the same thing every time and like always mine came out perfect! 

As for my husband, his porterhouse steak came out well done when it was requested to be medium. 
We let the server know and she immediately replaced it with another steak probably within 10-15 mins. Which was very impressive!
But the second steak was very salty and over seasoned... After we were done eating, the manager comes by to see how everything was and apologized for the 1st mistake and how the second one was. which we explained. 
The manager offered us a complimentary desert to take him which we gratefully denied. (We were very full)

Overall-
This one time mistake will not stop us from giving this location a 5 star!
The servers are sweet and prompt and the food is almost ALWAYS great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it out. The wait was extremely long. When we got seated our waitress did not even explain how the menu worked or how the steaks are cooked. She was rather rough and said crude jokes. My meal came out fine after another very long wait. My husbands came out wrong. It was tough and way overdone. He pointed it out and they did take it back and redo it after some more time. Our waitress was never around and we ran out of drinks. The manager was nice and came out and refilled our drinks a couple of times. I also felt the price was very inflated for the quality of the food we received. I was Not impressed."}
{"text":"I dislike chains and this past visit totally reminded me why. 

So we arrive and get taken to seats right away. The way waitress comes by drink orders in. We look at menus and decide. Wait starts. 

Ten minutes later and we order. Fried green tomatoes and the cheeses mushrooms. The best part of the whole experience. 

So as we are eating our \"veggies\" and the table on the other side of us has a challenge. The manager is in and out. Baby is crying. Mom and Dad are VERY angry. Something about this is their third visit and it's always bad (I'm thinking why three chances).  They storm out. 

It seemed the kitchen got backed up about here. Our waitress tells us there's only two guys in the kitchen and the senior employee out of the two of them had worked there 8 days. 

Food comes. I got the ribs and my companion had the bone in rib eye. Ordered it medium. It was well done. Now remember the kitchen is backing up, so if we want the steak redone it could take upwards of an hour. What?  

I have a very lucky dog who enjoys steak and doesn't care how it's cooked. 

Everything in our main course just seemed s beyond lackluster. With all the places in town I'm going to skip this one in the future."}
{"text":"Our server Salena H. Was very attentive and thoughtful. The Seasoned Steakhouse wings were out of this world. I was served more than enough with soup and salad lunch. I will definitely be returning to try the Chocolate Stampede with my husband. The mixologist at the bar was friendly and attentive as well."}
{"text":"I pass this place everyday on my way to work but I'd never stopped in until yesterday.  There's nothing wrong with steak on your lunch break, am I right?  It wasn't too busy so I was seated right away which was good since I was starving!  My server came over shortly after I was seated so didn't have to wait long for that either.  He was very polite and nice and I like how after you tell them how you want the steak cooked they describe it in detail just to make sure that's actually what you want, that gave me confidence that my steak really was going to be cooked to a wonderful, juicy medium rare and not cooked to death like some restaurants tend to do.  He also mentioned that they \"boldly season\" the steaks and wanted to make sure that was okay as well.

A couple minutes later he came back with the delicious, crusty honey wheat bread and the Caesar salad.  I thought the salad was a bit overdone with the amount of dressing but the bread was excellent.  The steak (filet) itself was wonderful.  PERFECTLY cooked, juicy, tender, great flavor, if I wasn't in public I probably would have licked the plate.  I had ordered the loaded baked potato as the side dish and that didn't disappoint either.  It was a good sized potato, nice and tender, with bacon, cheese and butter.

I'm now in a love-hate relationship with this place since I work within walking distance and it was so good it's going to be hard to keep myself from coming back all the time!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and the service sucked both times. The food is worse than the service. I really can't recommend this place at all, for the price, I would expect much better."}
{"text":"We always sit at the bar and get the BEST service.  Food is great too!  Nice atmosphere, friendly servers."}
{"text":"Terrible, over cooked steak full of fat. Slow service from the kitchen. Last time here"}
{"text":"Came back to Longhorn despite the previous poor service. This time, the waiter accidentally dumped my salad in my lap. The host offered to pay for our meal, but being sticky with salad and dressing isn't a comfortable way to enjoy lunch. So, we walked out. Accidents happen, but I've never had a salad dumped on me. Unbelievable. Won't be coming back or going to any Longhorns in the future."}
{"text":"We arrived around 9:00 on a Saturday and only waited about 5 minutes. We had the asparagus appetizer, which was delicious - I would recommend it. The ribs were fall off the bone good but the steak was undercooked, even after we sent it back. Our server was very nice and overall it was a nice night."}
{"text":"It's a chain... My family and I eat her on a regular bases  the serves is great and very constant as well as the food. They are very kid friendly and good atmosphere, slightly loud on Friday and Saturday evenings. Also a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Haven't had steak in a while and my wife let me chose the restaurant. Our server was okay. not very talkative but very competent. The steaks that we ordered, Flo's Filet and New York Strip came out just like we wanted them. The NY Strip had a little bite to it and we thoroughly enjoyed the food and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've dined here a couple of times with my parents during visits home. This has always been an A-OK option for dinner.

The service here has always been great. On my most recent visit the hostess was accommodating in placing us at a booth. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We didn't go long without seeing our waitress and she properly handled everything we needed. 

The food is okay, but not anything I would come for again. Factoring in the price I would say it's acceptable. My steak was flavored okay, but not overly tender. My loaded sweet potato was bland, even butter and sugar didn't improve the taste much. My parents and my brother liked their meals. 

Overall, a decent option for a low cost chain steakhouse meal."}
{"text":"This is based on my last visit , as I had almost given up on Longhorn after a previous BAD experience since the new renovations and menu change.

For starter's if you have NOT been to longhorn within the last year, they have a whole new menu, the prices have increased, and there is no more value menu.

We usually do call ahead seating when eating out, but this time we opted for \"let's just see how busy they are\", because if it was anything like our last visit the place should be empty.  Upon entering the door, the wait was approx 20 min, but I spoke to the host, and while it was just two of us, we opted for any seats that were available.  We were immediately sat, and we were seated right next to the kitchen. (Usually this is the worst seat in any restaurant).  

We were greeted by our server, \"Chuck\" he was very friendly, and promptly took our drink order.  The bread was quickly brought to the table which was still very warm, and the butter melted with ease. At this time I looked over the menu, and opted for the (limited time only special ) Rainbow Trout w/ Shrimp / Lobster Filling w/ Rice Pilaf and House Salad.  I have added a photo of the meal.

My wife had the Filet Mignon, with steamed vegetables and a house salad.  It was cooked perfectly, and the vegetables were awesome.  We were very pleasantly surprised.

My meal with the trout was excellent, and I was very excited that this location finally put GOOD SERVICE, and a GOOD MEAL together at the same time.

After this visit, I give them a four, because the server, who was stationed right beside us (at the kitchen door) was right on top of the service, with drinks, and with removing the dishes as they were emptied.

We skipped on the dessert this time, as we were very full from our meal.  but we what saw pass by us, looked very enticing.

I am all about second chances, and this was a redeeming factor for this location.

Kudos to the management, and to our wonderful server \"Chuck\".

We will be back, and would recommend giving these folks a try.

Best Regards,
NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"If it could be a negative star it would be. Went in last evening for a late dinner at 7:30 there were only 8 tables occupied and it took 20 minutes to get water and order dinner. Than an hour to get dinner delivered to our table.
Food is good but they need to have a manager on top of service instead of waiting until it is too late and have to comp customers to get them to come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Longhorn Steakhouse for dinner 11/11/2017. When the steaks were delivered to our table, they were not what we ordered. I agreed to accept the prime rib I was served instead of the ribeye I ordered. I was hungry. My friend ordered a filet and was served a sirloin. She sent it back. A few minutes later, the same steak came back on a new plate. It was the same steak- she had cut a bite out of it! The manager came to our table and tried to tell us the sirloin was a filet. I know what a filet looks like and that wasn't it. Rather than argue any more, she ate the steak. The manager also offered to send us a certificate for a free meal and took my email address. I haven't heard from him 3 weeks later. I filled out the survey on the receipt and asked to be contacted. Haven't heard from them. On top of serving us the wrong steaks, we were also billed for the more expensive steaks- the prime rib I didn't order and the filet she didn't get. Stay away from Longhorn! I've emailed them again to complain, but not holding my breath they will do anything."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic steaks. The fillet is one of the best I have had for a while. One of the better chains."}
{"text":"We went to eat at this steakhouse and had the.worst experience for our.first.time visit, i spoke a.few days.later.to.the manager an was told we would recieve a gift card and nothing its been.weeks"}
{"text":"Food is pretty average! Yet you can have the first date with the women  you love with all your heart here! So, we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"after my last visit and review, I was contacted in a very professional way by owner. he handles it exactly as businesses should and I am glad that they take these types of reviews seriously and can actually take note of places to improve upon.

I decided to give them another shot, this time we had a wonderful experience. Our Server, Jacob, was outstanding! never waivered on requests for extra dressing, our glasses did not even get half empty before he politely asked for our glasses to be passed to him (from the inside of table) for a refill.

I tried the garlic and provolone topped sirloin, the garlic was a little over powering for me, raw, and made my mouth burn, easy fix.. I just removed it. There was this nice gravy underneath the steak, which Jacob got us more of since we preferred that to the cheese & garlic topping.

Jacob really made this visit pleasant and it was a great experience. We chatted momentarily at the end, I explained I had written a not so pleasant review because of our last server and would be updating the great service & attitude he projected). I had to laugh as he said I was somewhat famous because the review was discussed in a meeting. I am so glad that the company actually made good on their statement that customer service would be addressed and refreshed. Although on last visit there was really only ONE person who really needed a lesson in it. Everyone else was great. This time I was very pleased and will continue to visit this location.

Thanks Jacob! and thanks to Jonathon, Alberto and the other staff as well! 
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews unless the place is top notch or the bottom of the barrel. Unfortunately this one was not top-notch. I ordered the filet mignon and had to send it back since it was full of gristle, was flat and tasted nothing like fillet. Ordered a second fillet and had to send that one back as well. I finally ended up with the chicken Parmesan which was way too salty/fatty and I questioned what was in the sauce. They comped us a free desert which I had to throw out since it tasted/smelled like body odor. The chicken cheddar appetizer wraps tasted like velveeta cheese that was frozen into tortilla bites and zapped in the microwave. The customer service was superb, so we tipped well since it wasn't their fault, but overall the food was horrid. I think this place could have potential if they fired the chefs and started ordering from quality supply companies. I've had better at Sizzler unfortunately."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this experience is the fact that there was no real wait at 8pm on a Saturday.

Our server forgot our straws twice. He said the bread was in the oven so it would be \"nice and warm.\" By the time we finally got bread, the butter was almost frozen and the bread was definitely not fresh out of the oven.

When one of the servers brought our salads, she had them stacked. Our food was under another plate. Touching. Disgusting. We didn't have any silverware, I asked her for some and with attitude she said she'd bring some. After 5 minutes of staring at my food, I had to go get us silverware for another table.

The steaks were overcooked, the ribeye was bland, the filet was extremely salty, I couldn't eat the lobster tail because it was so salty, and the loaded baked potato was dry.

Coming here was supposed to be a treat for us for working so hard recently. Thanks for ruining it."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and have not been enthusiastic about it. We came this time since it was a family outing and someone else selected the location. I feel it has improved over my last visit. Still not my first choice but I will not fight returning if someone else suggests it."}
{"text":"Went there on super bowl Sunday.   Service was a bit slow for the amount of patrons that were there.   Dillon was my server,  he was very friendly and attentive.   The salad was the best thing I ordered.   I had the broccoli and cheese soup,  it was a bit salty abd pasty.   I wouldn't recommend this.   The steak was OK but nothing to rave about,  also a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Stopped by Longhorn after a long day with a hungry party of 7. The original plan was to eat at Logan's but their wait time was 45-60 mins. NO. CAN'T DO IT NO WAY STARVING. We called ahead to check for availability and wait time and we were told 10-15 mins and to come on in. Wait time was at least 20 and they sat us at a booth with a random chair added to the middle of the floor. This was odd since they have those round table/booths and bigger tables. We asked to move and they accommodated relatively shortly afterwards. (Sn, a couple, like literally two, were seated at one of the giant round booths, without requesting it and I found this rather strange.) We ordered drinks, appetizers and our food all at once to expedite the process.  Wild West shrimp was our first appetizer. They are pretty good, have a little kick to them but nothing that requires water immediately afterwards. I kind of wish they came with like a glaze or a sauce on them. They are served with ranch if you're into that. They serve fried pickles in a little cast iron skillet, I hate pickles personally but my dinner mate seemed to enjoy them. 

Entrees

Lamb chops: very small, not the greatest probably shouldn't go for this if you're very hungry 

Parmesan crusted  chicken: 3/3 for our table, a go to item for many 

Steak: 3/5

Chicken tenders: tasty but pretty small, they come in 9 and 12

Broccoli: hit or miss, some pieces were raw while others were fully steamed 

Overall, a solid meal. Reasonably priced. The service was alright. No huge complaints or compliments to speak of?"}
{"text":"Went today for my Veterans free dessert, as advertised online. Manager said that I had to buy an entree to get the deal. I showed him online that it showed \"no purchase necessary and no restriction\". He told me that he could not and refused to honor it. Is this how Longhorn treats its veterans? Any good manager would have just honored the deal... in honor of our service. Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always, but I was hoping to have a nice quiet dinner with my husband. That was not to be. For the last 10 minutes an employee was chatting with a couple in in the booth behind us. I have no problem with employees talking to customers, but if I have to raise my voice so my husband can hear me, I am not amused. The employee would get excited about the topic (basketball) and his voice will get louder and louder. Time to get to work now....please."}
{"text":"MEH....
It was ok I guess not the experience I would expect for a 100 bucks. Wifey had a chicken salad which se said was good. The daughter had a cheese burger which had no sauce,ketchup,mustard etc. I had the $25 outlaw ribeye. The steak was cooked to order but it had lots of gristle and two bones in it so the portion was small.
The Service was good but we waited a long time for the food to arrive was about 20+ minutes."}
{"text":"I was wanting a steak and i was passing your restaurant so decidedly come in and try it out !!! I was sat right away and my server Rachel came to the table and introduced Herself !!! She was very polite and professional .. Her knowledge about the menu was great !!! Every question I asked she could answer... I was very impressed. I ended up ordering the filet ,medium rare, came out perfect.. My server Rachel had to of been one of the best servers I've ever had in my life. She was so attentive and anything I needed she was right there to help me with... Ive been a lot of places and I have to save my experience here was one of my favorite ever in a restaurant... Wanted to let you guys know that Rachel is amazing and I will be coming back to see her and I will be sending all my friends in to see her. Thank you so much"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I came here with my husband and our daughter. We were one of only three tables, yet the waitress was inattentive and not concerned with refilling our drinks or checking on us. She was unfriendly, snappy, and impatient. On my way back from the restroom, I overheard  her complaining to another employee about our table. Apparently, she was very irritated that we brought our daughter, as she was particularly upset that my daughter had accidentally spilled some food on the table. She doesn't need to worry; we won't be going back. Seriously, this restaurant is not family friendly. I will never give them my business again."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! No wait to be seated. Service was a little slow at first but the deliciousness of the food was well worth it. I got the broccoli cheese soup, salad and the filet. The best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had!! Good salad. The wheat bread that was on the table was ok, nothing special. My steak was delicious! A little on the pricey side, we used gift cards we had for this restaurant"}
{"text":"After my last visit, more than two years ago, I come here with \"open mind\" and try to give them better rank. 
Last time was very (very) bad - ended in 1 star ranking. 
So today......we didn't get the salad we order!!!
Just when the steak order arrived, I ask the waiter \"and where is our salads\"?????

Oh my god - what Reasturant don't understand about it?
How come they don't understand that service is everything!?!?

I giving them 1 star again - sorry - you don't deserved more"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and have not been disappointed. Great steaks and good service. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here tonight. It exceeded my expectations. 

I ordered an 8 ounce sirloin steak with a lobster tail. 
The steak was so tender, I actually thought they brought me a filet by mistake. But the waiter assured me it was a sirloin. 

The lobster tail was delicious. It was perfectly cooked with very sweet succulent meat. Definitely cold water, not a cheap Caribbean lobster. 

Overall the food was better than I expected and I already thought LongHorn is the best of the 3 steak houses at Metro. Of course it's not on the level of Ruth's Chris or Morton's, but for the price, it was excellent."}
{"text":"Awful service, arrogant manager, lazy bar lady (with long hair and glasses) who couldn't wait to go on break while she ignored my paid order and knew I was sitting there for over an hour   waiting for my $10.00 take out order in which I called in advanced before I arrived there. I asked for my refund and was disgusted with the whole crew I even refused their free food. Sometimes, its not about getting free food for inconvenience and inconsideration its about customer service! Your customer service was awful why would I want to eat your food?  You guys are an awful crew and you have an arrogant manager. I won't come back to this establishment again."}
{"text":"It used to be that Pineville was flooded with steakhouses but this is the only one that has survived.  And the reason for it is they have a decent  location, they keep their menu current, the decor of the restaurant is classy and the staff is always friendly here.

I love the healthier options they have added to the menu in recent years.  At one time they even had the calorie counts on the menu but they took that off.  I guess not everyone found them as helpful as I do.  

Anyway, the food is fresh here and quite appetizing.   I usually get chicken here - the Sierra Chicken or the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  I bypass the rice in favor of steamed veggies.   The bread served is a whole grain variety which is quite tasty, especially if it's piping hot from the oven.

The meals are priced well and you definitely feel you are getting your money's worth.  This is a good value and good food for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We went back on Friday for salads and had a different waiter and had an excellent services."}
{"text":"We checked in at 515 and we're told 35 minute wait on a Sunday. We were seated an hour later. We stopped a waitress 20 minutes later and she said she would find our server. Twenty minutes later....We left.  Menu looked good. Place wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"A decade ago I was at a longhorn stack house and out of 8 people there I was the only person who never got my food until everyone was done eating and it came in a to go bag. I got the hint and never returned. New girlfriend who was asking all week to go to this same restaurant but different location. I gave in and we went at 6:30pm. We sat down around 7:30 and ordered our food. I ordered the prime rib rare she went off to do her rounds. 30 minutes later she comes back and says they don't make prime rib rare how is medium rare? I agreed and she was gone for maybe 5 minutes to come back and say there are no more prime ribs. So I order a ribeye same way medium rare. We waited until almost 9 o'clock until we got our food and were told our order went to another table. My steak was cooked well done and my girlfriends steak was cooked medium rare when she ordered well and her plate was cold with mash potatoes instead of baked potato. Once again after 10 years I box up my food to eat at home. They gave us free desert but charged us for it on the bill we pointed out to them to take off and gave us 2, 5 dollar off cards for a next visit. Don't think I'll make the same mistake a third time? Next time we are going to the outback"}
{"text":"We live about an hour south of this location but decided to stop in after a long day of travelling. We were seated fairly quickly for an early Saturday evening. The place seems clean and was busy, so that's usually a good sign. However, I ordered a sirloin that was a terrible disappointment. The first sirloin I received was about 40% fat and inedible (I didn't even try with all of the fat) and sent the steak back. The server returned in a little while with another steak and when I cut it open, it was rare (I ordered it medium). I showed the server, who was very pleasant and apologetic, and she said, \"No, that's definitely not medium.\"  So, the steak was returned again.  (I even apologized to my server for being difficult...I wasn't trying to be a pain). The steak came out again and it was medium rare, but I decided to keep it. By this time, my dining partner was done with her food so I took a couple bites and asked for a to go box. I was disappointed that the manager didn't even come over to apologize or ask if there was anything they could do. I wasn't expecting a free meal or anything, but an apology would go a long way. The food was edible but bland. It will be the last LongHorn we eat at for a very long time, we'll stick with Texas Roadhouse.  They have better food, better prices and much better management."}
{"text":"We were much happier with the service here than with the food.

A friend and I were in town from San Diego for Spring Training baseball and this restaurant was close to our hotel so we decided to check it out.  We arrived at appx. 7pm on Saturday, so we expected it to be busy.  We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes so we had a drink in the bar and were seated in about 40 minutes.

Our server, Samantha, greeted us immediately and was quite attentive.  One of the managers, Matt, also stopped by to greet us.  The salads came out pretty quickly and were good (caesar).  The entrees took a little longer than we though they should... I ordered a Medium steak with Mac & Cheese and my friend had salmon and cheese grits.  My steak came out just between Rare and medium rare, and my friend's risotto on the side was ICE COLD.  However, both of these issues were clearly NOT Samantha's fault as she could not have known by looking.

She took our food back to the kitchen, and in the interim, another manager stopped by as well to inquire as to what occurred.  We told him and he was quite apologetic.

All in all, we had a good experience and would probably return if in town again.  Great service, but the kitchen made it 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"LongHorn Steakhouse
1434 S. Alma School Road
Mesa, Arizona  85210

(Preface) I don't usually like to evaluate chain restaurants, but with more and more people eating at them it seemed proper to evaluate this one. This is part of the Darden chain, which also includes Olive Garden, etc. 

I arrived at 6:15, and though told it was a 10 minute wait, I was seated in 3 minutes. My waiter brought a drink and warm bread quickly and handed me the menu as well as explained the specials of the night. 

The waiter, Tim, was extremely attentive and honest when asked about items on the menu. How refreshing! I was originally going to get the Rib Eye Steak, but Tim suggested that I get the larger Rib Steak on the Bone. He wasn't pushy, but offered good reasons to get it - an excellent job of up-selling for a restaurant. I also ordered a Baked Potato with lots of butter and a salad with Honey Mustard Dressing.

Of the Bread, I can only say it was warm. I didn't care for the flavor of it, and it almost seemed to be under baked and lacking in flavor. The Salad was a nice portion with a good dressing, though I didn't care for the diced tomato on it. Diced tomato is a way of a restaurant saving money by not using premium tomatoes. Not a good idea.

In due course my steak appeared. I had ordered it rare, and it came medium. My waiter immediately took it back, apologized, and had a new one cooked properly with a new baked potato in minutes. Great service. The steak was perfectly cooked this time, with perhaps a touch too much of seasoning, but that is an individual preference. The potato was properly presented with lots of butter as I had asked. My biggest criticism is the same one I have in many steak houses - I hate being given oversized knives with serrated edges. If the steak is as tender as steak houses claim, a sharp, plain edged knife will easily do the job without tearing up the meat. My steak had a bit of silver skin still on it, which should have been removed by the butcher. My waiter kept checking up to make sure my drink was full and I had everything I wanted.

I was quite full, and my waiter promptly brought a take home box and even brought a small cruet to put some horse radish sauce in. (I like horse radish on more than just prime rib). Most places make a big deal out of my ordering it, but my waiter didn't bat an eye and even brought extra.

Even though I was full, I wanted to try dessert. While many of the desserts are brought in from the outside, I was told that the Caramel Apple Goldrush was made in house. My only comment about it would be to describe it as comfort food. Warm, gooey, comforting apples in a rich sauce with lots of cinnamon and caramel sauce, topped with a very smooth vanilla ice cream slowly melting over it. I could have made a meal just out of this dessert! It's a real winner.

I have eaten in some of the top restaurants of the world, from those of the Iron Chef's to the Flagship of Mortons in Hong Kong to Elements in Paradise Valley, and the service I had tonight was right up there if not better than any of them. Service can make or break a meal, and service was absolutely tops tonight. Kudo's to Tim, my waiter, and I hope my tip showed him just how much I appreciated him.

3 1/2 stars for the food, and an extra  1/2 star for service and cleanliness for a total of 4 stars. I will definitely evaluate this restaurant again in the future to see if the service stays up to standard."}
{"text":"Had a group party here today for my 84yo Mother.  There were 15 of us.  They don't do reservations but I gave a lot of notice we were coming and they were kind enough to work with us.  We were seated in time to surprise her when she walked in. Our waiter, Cory, did a great job.  Food was great! The firecracker shrimp and mushroom appetizers were perfect.  Everyone's meals were good.  Thank you Longhorn for making this a great day for my mom and our family."}
{"text":"I'm on this rib kick lately, never tried them until Mother's Day now I'm in love. I've only had them at one place and decided to spread my wings and try a new place today.  Well I went to long horn and ordered the ribs at first they were ok, then I realized they were too charred to the point where you couldn't taste the meat unless you put something else in your mouth to get rid of the taste.  Now I'm not a rib expert but I know I don't like the burnt taste I experienced today it was gross.  I guess I should just stick to my other place and not try to adventure out any more.  And it also was laced with fat, yeah yeah I know things being cooked with fat is a wonderful thing but being presented with it is nasty.  Getting a fork full of fat is gross.  But the potato man that was a good tater...lol"}
{"text":"We moved to Phoenix in March and have been trying different restaurants this one is a chain but wanted to try them. I have to say we were disappointed the Filet was very tender but so salty I could not finish. The Lobster Mac and Cheese came out cold and had so much shrimp in it that it was fishy tasting. the  bake Potato was barely warm but tasted good. Staff did not seem to care. We will not go back to many better choices at this price point."}
{"text":"Average steakhouse at best.  I ordered a rib eye for 19.49.  It came with a side and a salad.  I got the loaded bake potato which was nothing special.  Cheese wasn't melted and needed a magnifying glass to see the bacon.  It was also on the smaller side.  I upgraded the salad for another $1.59 to get the strawberry salad and pecan salad. It was overdrenched in dressing and had a small piece of 1 orange.  Not as advertised.  I added on sauteed mushrooms/onions for $3.29.  This was on the high end for this kind of place and for what you got.  The honey bread was decent.   

Service was OK given how crowded it was.  Bar area has a bunch of tables and few televisions."}
{"text":"I got a berry/citrus/pecan chicken salad with field greens and a chocolate stampede cake with vanilla ice cream I split with a friend. I took my friend out to eat here and they loved it! The cake was the best, mousse-like texture and creamy! Mm yummy. And the chicken on the salad was tender with a tasty dressing and fresh toppings. I love longhorn! Their sweet potatoes are awesome too, with brown sugar and butter.. perfect for a cold night."}
{"text":"Diane our waitress was attentive and knew the menu well. Jeorge the manager greeted us. It was our first time. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  We have tried this place 4 times and each time the steaks come out raw.  I order it medium and explain that I want it pink.  Please don't bring it purple or raw.  And it comes out purple anyway. Manager apologizes and then it comes back out Raw.  We had 6 people in our party and all 6 were not cooked!   

So sad because Longhorns has a MUCH BETTER. Reputation than this!   So disappointed.   At 25.00 a steak it should be perfect!!!!

Never coming back again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Live the 7 pepper steak salad. Has a good kick to it. Tomato basil soup is good too but has to many croutons.

Great for lunch if you are looking for a good quick lunch and not to many people. Good for meetings because it is usually fairly queit at lunch time. Not sure why.. just is."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I visited this location a little after 9 pm. Bill was the manager on duty. I ordered the outlaw ribeye my fiancé ordered a steak salad. 

After several terrible experiences at the Cranberry location we were a bit nervous trying this one.

Our food was absolutely perfect, our waitress was on point, prompt, courteous and helpful. We could not have asked for a better meal! Very impressed. 

Well done longhorn of Robinson."}
{"text":"I've been here about 6 times already. Everyone is saying the service is horrible but in my experience it has always been outstanding. They did get my order wrong once but I can't complain because the manager took care of the bill for our visit and fired up another steak for me immediately. It was the hectic day after Valentine's Day. 

Hostess and servers are always smiling and make you feel right at home. 

The bread is a little bland but taste great when you spread that butter on it. 

Caesar salad is good. 

I like my steaks medium well and they have always been cooked perfectly. 

They have a full bar but I haven't experienced it since I don't drink too much. You won't see me there.

Really enjoy the food here and will continue to dine here as long as long as the service and food remains at a high standard. 

Keep the steaks coming. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here! We had an amazing server, wonderful food and it was very clean. I got the t bone steak, medium rare, cooked perfectly. And my husband got a burger. Both were amazing and we were so stuffed. Our drinks were never empty, and our service was super fast!! Our food came out in less than 15 minutes! The only critique I would give is that my side salad was smothered in dressing, but I didn't mind it, their ranch is delicious. 5/5 on all categories!"}
{"text":"Normally, good service and great food. Today was severely a different experience. Server only came to our table to take our order and give us our drinks. Kept forgetting to bring silverware and bread. Our entrees came out within 2 minutes of our salads. My steak was medium when asked for medium well. Sever never came to check on drinks or how food was until we were done and both of us could have used more drinks and some bread with meal. Asked for more water and received it with the bill, server never even asked if we wanted desert. Other servers consistently with their tables, yet ours was not seen at any of her tables much."}
{"text":"Wifey and I enjoy this place, and here is why:

1) You can almost always get seated quickly, even for larger parties;
2) the wait staff are helpful with regard to the menu;
3) you get good value for your dollar;
4) Outlaw Ribeye;
5) Outlaw Ribeye;
6) you get the idea;

I recommend you skip the appetizers, like many chain places these are a revenue grab for more profit from customers and they deliver minimal value to the customer.  This is my humble opinion.  I do a thought experiment whenever I get appetizers or dessert: would I come to this place and order only this appetizer or only this dessert?  Would I get an entree somewhere else and stop off here to pickup dessert?  If the answer is no, and it usually is, then they aren't worth ordering.

The entrees are what bring me to many restaurants and I think that is how they get you in the door.  Outback really pushes the blooming onion as a draw, which is sad, a steakhouse isn't an onion house, the steak should be the draw and not the onions.

LongHorn has achieved this - the steak is the draw.  Come here and eat steak.  I can't review any other entrees that aren't steak because I don't think about coming to LongHorn when I am not eating steak.  That isn't anything against LongHorn - when I got to a steakhouse it is 100% because I am in the mood for steak.  I am normal that way.  I don't go to Bonefish grill and order steak - I order fish (although not bonefish).

Loaded mashed potatoes are what I skirt my steak with.  I recommend them - but ask them to ixna the melted butter.  Sour cream and butter is too rich in my opinion to have on your potato starch."}
{"text":"This place is so slow. Waited and waited just ordered hamburgers and it took for ever. Not recommended if you want to do something afterwards since every place will be closed"}
{"text":"Terrific service, food and room. Not a peanut on the floor 20 something bar type place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We usually come here for the bread.  The food is good.. it gets busy in the evenings.  You can call ahead to reserve seat"}
{"text":"The one negative thing is the pricing and the a la cart  for the meal should be a complete meal .  Now as to the Devore nice. As to hostess great friendly kept us info on when table be ready. Yo the Waitress and the trainee super did job well  very personal great smile , personally, very knowledgeable of the menu had great subjecting on how to get what you want for meal   Both helped out with taken the pics of our group and the ice cream with candle at the end was a great added touch   If you go to this restaurant asked to be seated in Alyssa or Britney I believe they need a raise they get a five star rating"}
{"text":"My regular Friday night dinner out (really my only dining out on a weekly basis). The bartenders are cool- sit there instead of a table. Cheap steaks doesn't mean cheap beef- order your steaks medium at the most. Best temperature for sure!"}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday for lunch.

We were seated promptly and  our server was attentive and polite the whole time.

Longhorn has added a 500 calorie preperation for several dish's on their menu.  I am really a big fan of any place that adds calorie info and sticks to it,

We both got flo's filet 7oz and vegetables.  The steaks were well prepared.

The manager even came by and asked us how the food was.

I recommend this steakhouse to those of us who like to fit in our pants."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best steaks I've had. Perfectly done and flavorful. Also loved the stuffed mushroom appetizers, although I could tell they weren't exactly the healthiest thing on the menu. The bread was also very good.

We were kept waiting quite a while on our order (they had forgotten about it). The other strange thing was a confrontation we witnessed between the manager and an unruly, yelling customer. Whatever had happened, it's safe to say there was something off with the customer, but the manager could have found a better place to resolve the issue than right in the middle of the dining room, which distracted most of the diners and was pretty uncomfortable for a second. Otherwise, I'd say he did the best he could to diffuse things."}
{"text":"Great steaks for the price. Always good service. Don't get me wrong, they aren't the greatest steak place. But the best in the affordable/causal range."}
{"text":"We received a Darden group gift card and decided to try out Longhorn and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food considering it is a chain! 

We went out in the pouring rain on a Monday night so it wasn't a surprise the restaurant was well below capacity. Our waitress was attentive and kept my water filled the whole meal (no small feat since I usually drink a good amount). Since we had a gift card we went all out with our selections. 

We started with the spicy chicken bites which were delicious and on their happy hour special (4pm-7pm weeknights). I chose the filet and lobster with the blue cheese salad and asparagus as the side. My salad came with a bit too much dressing and the boyfriend said his Caesar came with too little. This would be a good place to order dressing on the side to control the portions! 

My filet came out as a perfect medium and was very tender. The man said his rib eye was cooked as ordered and he opted for the mushroom topping which they were very generous with! 

Since we had a gift card we opted for a few upcharges but I definitely see this place as somewhere you can be thrifty. Right now they have a steak dinner on special for $12.99 including salad and starter or dessert. I am tempted to return to try this before the special ends!"}
{"text":"We just ate here again and this is hands down the best Longhorn Steakhouse! We have eaten at several in different parts of the country. Friendly staff, great manager, and the food is always excellent!  Our favorite chain restaurant in Paradise Valley!"}
{"text":"Nicholas F went above and beyond, I've been waiting for a prime rib for a beetling time, went it arrived slightly over cooked , They let me nibble on the overcooked prime rib while I waited for the perfectly cooked one.. it's the small things that count, thanks Nick!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my rib eye, baked potato, salad and glass of red wine. Good customer service. I appreciated their making the salad gluten-free, without croutons."}
{"text":"This place has bad service never going back again had too flag down other waiters to get refills and had charges on our bill that we didnt order and when we told manager she just says what you want me too do about it. We got it taken off but after much arguing back and forth .....our waiter was nowhere too b found too verify what we ordered , we came too this place after we had bad service at the metro center longhorns but got even worst service never going back too any of their restaurants"}
{"text":"Longhorn's motto is \"Welcome to the West\" but they seem to be more of an east coast chain that has just recently started expanding out this way. This particular location still has that new-restaurant smell on it (even though the carpets were pretty dirty - it looks like this location is popular with families that have a lot of messy kids).  All the decor and finishings looked very new. They have a contemporary feel with nice hardwood and slate tile everywhere but then they throw on a heaping load of western inspired kitch. The atmosphere left us expecting more of a west Texas, mesquite grill but really I would categorize their menu as more of a typical Midwestern steakhouse.

We started off with a bad first impression since the hostess gave us a fob and asked us to wait in the bar for a table for about 15 minutes. I didn't understand why it would take that long since I could see several empty tables from where we were standing. I got the distinct impression that they were hoping we would wander into the bar and spend more money but since we instead chose to hover around the hostess stand our actual wait was only about 7 minutes. Other than that, the service we received here was very good. Our waitress was really sweet and friendly and very attentive. If only the food had been better, this might become one of our regular spots. My salad was mostly wilted iceberg lettuce and I really didn't eat much of it. My husband's Caesar was a little better but still sub-par. We both ordered steak, assuming that was their specialty. Hubby got the porterhouse which came swimming in melted butter. The mashed potatoes had been likewise shaped into a volcano mound with butter overflowing out of it. It grossed me out just to look at it. He of course ate it all but I just don't know why it needed that much butter since a good porterhouse is well marbled and should have plenty of fat already in the meat. For my entree, I ordered the 7oz fillet. This too had butter all over it but no other seasoning whatsoever. It was very tender but almost too much so. I know you are thinking how can a steak be too tender but it just really affected the texture in my mouth in an unpleasant way. The steak turned to mush after a few bites. They must use a meat tenderizing powder or else they pound the crap out of it with a mallet before cooking. Since the steak was so flavorless, I don't think the tenderness came from the quality of the beef at all. My side dish was the sweet potato bites and in contrast these were pretty darn good. I could have skipped the steak and salad and just eaten a whole plateful of those. Still, I have had sweet potato tots at a sports bar that were equally delicious so I think that is just my love of sweet potatoes talking and not really a selling point for the quality of the food at Longhorn.

I do like the fact that this place offers a good variety of food. There are many options for side dishes and you can add on additional ones at a reasonable price. Also, they have chicken, ribs, and pork chops in addition to the steak. But I would rather go to Firebirds and pay a little more for a meal I know I will love if I am in the mood for this type of food."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE!!!

The yumminess begins with the fresh hot loaf of honey wheat bread and butter that they bring to you when you order your drinks.  Make sure to try the TexasTonion appetizer, it is crispy onion petals drizzled with sour cream and served with a zesty dipping sauce. I'm not much of a salad person but I do love their's.  The steak is so good, I usually get the Flo's filet and it is the best around.  This is my favorite place and I go here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to a restaurant...there are 2 things that I base my judgment off of...Customer Service and Food Quality. The Food was absolutely amazing!! Although they are a little bit pricey but its well worth it! However customer service was good not great. Our server seemed to not wanna be there attitude. Although the hostess and the store manager were excellent!!! This place is something you must try!! I definitely recommend and I will be returning in the future!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Awesome food.  The crab dip was excellent, the steak was excellent.  The salad was excellent.  Our server Woody gave exceptional service. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Not good at all. The food was very bland. I went there Sunday 4/12/2015 and what a disappointment. The 8 oz prime rib was over cook and very bland and I ordered it blackened what went wrong I'm not sure and the bake potatoes were old...my leftovers are still n the refrigerator."}
{"text":"If you're craving FLAVORFUL STEAK!! Try them!

This place took me by surprise. The steak was seasoned very well. No need for any sauces. It's delicious on its own. This is a classic steak and potatoes type of restaurant. Don't expect anything Modern. It's a chain after all. 

Ps. I would skip the Parmesan crust. It doesn't need it. 

Pss. Beware of waiters up selling you without notifying you of up charges. Major pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Longhorn. Nicole and Lindsey are fun and great bartenders.I look forward to seeing both of them.They make me feel at home."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service at lunch today.  Host was nice,  waiter very friendly and even met the manager.  Chicken with feta and spinach was great and the asparagus was perfectly cooked. Loved everything!"}
{"text":"We ended up here after a call in on New Years Eve and were seated after a short wait. The place was jammed, yet despite the crush four of us were  totally pleased with our meals and appetizers and especially the service. This is an indicator of good management. Someone tell Chas M. that the steak juices on the plate are for dipping bread in- it's not 'grease'. Poor lad has been missing out on some good eats. Also Chas, your attempts at journalism need to be shorter."}
{"text":"Came here to eat dinner with my brother on a Monday night. We were seated within 2 minutes of walking in the door and served rather quickly.  I guess that's the perk of coming on a weeknight. I wish I could remember our server's name because she was amazing!!! She got our drinks out so quickly and answered any questions we had.

She was very attentive with us and made sure we were happy with everything.  The cooks did a fabulous job with our chicken dinners (Crusted Garlic Parmesan Chicken and Napa Chicken) and made sure that every single bite was packed with flavor.

The Napa Chicken dinner has a sauce that went perfect with the mushrooms and baked potato as a side.  The mushrooms and artichokes were sliced perfectly and drizzled with the sauce.  The Crusted Chicken was so creamy and delicious that it was one of those dishes that you keep eating even when you're full.  It went great with the mashed potatoes in my opinion.  

So if you're looking for great service and delicious food! Come on down!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a business luncheon... We were quickly seated and given menus. The waitress came by very shortly and took drink orders and asked if we were ready to order or she could come back. She was very through and went thru all the explaining on how they season the steaks, and explained how to order so that we would be happy with the end result! She also inquired if we were on a \"lunch hour\"  Loaves of bread were sent out quickly and they smelled heavenly! (I am gluten free, so was not able to enjoy,, but the 4 people I was with inhaled 4 loaves in front of me with out a complaint!) Lunch was quickly served and everyone enjoyed the food ordered. I had the under 500 cal - Flat iron steak, green beans & salad (waitress reminded me of the croutons which were left off :o) I thought it was a great lunch and I am happy to see another nice option in Surprise! The desserts looked incredible!"}
{"text":"after reviews we decided to take a chance - this was a solid choice ....... we had great service from all the staff and the food was steakhouse delicious"}
{"text":"We were arrived earlier than normal for us.(5:30) seating was fairly quick . Waitress was there fairly soon after we sat down. Took drink order and it wasn't to long before we were served and asked if we were ready to order. Food came fairly quick after we ordered. Salads were good and fresh. Four Meals , salmon, steak and chicken dishes. Steak cooked correctly, salmon and chicken the same. Here's the not so good parts. I am sorry to say I order as one of my sides the mashed potatoes they were COLD. The waitress had accidentally pushed one fork and said would bring another. Problem food came and no fork. I finally had to ask another waitress for a fork. When our waitress came by she didn't even say she was sorry for not following up on her mistake. In defense they did bring a new dish of mashed. Sorry, didn't feel like I was welcome. Waitress seem cool, not overly friendly. Been there before and had written a better review."}
{"text":"Flo's filet overcooked and not as good a cut of meat as expected.  Sweet potato was excellent.  Wife's tilapia was superb.  Service very good.  Next time I'm having the fish."}
{"text":"The firecracker chicken wraps as an appetizer are outstanding!  We get them every time we come here.  The service is just ok.  The steaks are decent- better than Outback, but not on par with Hyde Park etc.."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner there on Friday night with our 14 month old. We had a great experience overall!! The hostess was so nice , which I think is so rare these days. Seems like sometimes the hostesses are always the worst?! Our server was a young man being trained and both of them were amazing. They were sincerely nice and seemed like they actually cared . They took such good care of us . We even had employees that weren't our servers clearing our plates and asking if we needed anything.  Our flos filets and Mac and cheese were perfect too.  I feel more and more we go out the service is so so poor so I just wanted to share this.  Keep it up longhorn in Montrose!!!"}
{"text":"Prior to this visit , I was a Longhorn virgin.  So to be fair, this review is based only on my very first visit which was good and I'd go back if I could press replay on this visit.
That being said, I am surprised by the low rating here. 

Three of us shared the Texas onion (similar to OB bloomin onion) but we liked this version better.Wild west shrimp was also shared. Cherry peppers gave it a nice zing.

Salads that came with the entrees were fresh and big. Had we known it came already dressed, we would have asked for it on the side.But it was a perfect amount anyway.

I had the porterhouse, great, cooked the way I like it. Nice tender ,flavorful. Mashed taters were good.

Friend had filet (7oz.) again, tender,cooked the way requested, good. Served with giant loaded baked potato.

Last dish was a new menu item ( I don't know how new, like I said this was my first visit.)Parmesan crusted chicken . 
Menu states \" two juicy chicken breasts grilled and topped with parmesan cheese and garlic crust.\" Surprisingly, It was described just as it was served. She enjoyed it!

Service was great ! So much to the fact when the manager came over to check in and see if we enjoyed our dinner , I made a point to compliment the excellent service.( I'm sure the verbal compliment was just the icing on the cake. The real compliment was the nice tip I left !

I'm not sure if they have a lunch menu But I did notice the dessert menu.None of us had room for dessert.

The place is big and looked as if it had a private dining spot.

Listen, I am not a steak house aficionado.But based on this visit, I like Longhorn chain better then O.B and L.S."}
{"text":"Up until this week, I had not been a huge fan of LongHorn and this rating is based solely on this one visit. 

You're probably wondering why I continued to go back if I'm not a fan?!?  Great question!  Well...my husband absolutely loves it so I try my best to do the good wifey thing and indulge him every now and again.  :-)   

This one time, I am actually glad that he didn't give into my protest and he convinced me to go. Our meal was (surprisingly) outstanding!! Not that I ever thought that the food was \"bad\", but it was just \"meh\" for me (and I hate to pay for \"meh\"!).  However, this meal was anything, but \"meh\". This week we decided to try the \"Porterhouse for 2\" and it knocked my socks off!  It was a great piece of meat, seasoned perfectly, cooked properly (medium rare), and seriously delicious. It came with 2 salads (the reason for only 4 stars for this visit...I will get to that later), 2 sides (we had Asparagus and Broccoli), a bulb of roasted garlic (oh, heck yes!!!) and a small bowl of Sizzling Brown Magic known as \"LongHorn Steak Sauce\". Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are purists when it comes to steak...we don't over season or typically add any sauces (although we do love a good chimichurri). We like to let the meat speak for itself.  But, SWEET BABY JESUS....their steak sauce was awesome! They prepare it tableside and it's served hot. Let me repeat...ITS SERVED HOT! Who woulda thought?!?  If I wasn't afraid of scorching my tongue, I would have liked the bowl clean...it was THAT good!.  

One taste of the steak with a slice of garlic and a dab of sauce and the angels began to sing. My husband was so happy (and surprised) to see that I was loving it that he was gitty. He even explained our situation to our server and I could hear him getting choked up (not really, but you get my point) when he uttered the words \"she wants to come back\". (You're welcome, honey!) 

So...if it was so darn good...then why the 4 stars (instead of 5)?  3 words...Warm.Salad.Plates.  Seriously, people...cold foods need to be served on cold plates. Even if the plates aren't completely chilled...for the love of all this is right in the world...don't use warm plates for salad!  The server apologized and said that they were training a new salad person and that she used the wrong plates. I get it, but I wanted to ask why she (the server) didn't notice when she picked them up?  hmmm, oh well...I guess going from the typical \"meh\" to absolute perfection was expecting a lot. It was a blip on the radar compared to the rest of the meal, so I've moved on.

Will I go back...YES, but I will only ever order that same meal again. Hopefully, it will be just a good. Consistency is a difficult ask for even the best restaurants. I will be sure to keep you Yelpers posted!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to steak place in Charlotte.  Admittedly, I've been trying to save for my house down payment so I haven't even had a steak in nearly 8 months, but I finally closed on my house so I wanted to splurge.  

Me and my fella arrived at 5:45pm on a Saturday.  We were seated immediately and our server was delightful.  The problems all came from the kitchen- my fella's steak was underdone so he sent it back to be cooked more.  It took so long for them to get his steak finished that I'd already finished my entire meal and he'd already eaten his side dish.  So when his 2nd steak finally arrived, still far under cooked by the way, he just coated it with steak sauce and ate what he could so we could get on with our evening.

This is the type of circumstance I expect at Golden Corral, not at Long Horn STEAKhouse.  Guess I'll find another go-to steak place now that I can afford it again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night so we knew there would be a wait. We were told 35-40 minutes, when in reality it was over an hour. Once seated (after we had to wait again to have the table cleaned up)  we ordered the firecracker chicken app which was good. We each ordered filet's, salads and potato. My filet was very salty and charred. After telling the waitress about a coupon for a free app she still charged us and had to spend 10 minutes voiding it. We spent over two hours here and am not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit & I have to say probably my only. The service was so slow. Everything took forever. When our food finally did come we had 3-4 items missing and one corn on the cob we had to ask for a second time. Then it came cold & this supposed amazing Parmesan crusted corn was not even edible. The food was just ok, but the terrible service is what's keeping us from coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Had a great steak with crab. Service was very good and even though they were busy: fast service and attentive waiters ."}
{"text":"Dinner was super pleasant! Lindsay was our server and she was super nice and I loved that we never had to ask for anything! Food was pretty good and it was timed perfectly :) We'll definitely be back and ask for Lindsay!!"}
{"text":"Finally returned with my husband after attending a Yelp event months ago. We used a free appetizer card we were given and ordered the calamari and then ordered the Porterhouse for two. 

I was not a fan of the calamari,  they were really heavy on the sauce so it became overwhelming after awhile. The steak was really delicious with a nice flavor. It did come with table-side sauce but I actually preferred the steak on its own. It was a lot of food but my husband managed to finish it for us : )"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. I am here in North Carolina on business and always use the opportunity when travelling to try different venues. I sat at the bar. It was not too busy. Bartender who served me was David. I ordered a bone in ribeye and sweet potato, sautéed mushrooms, and a skewer of shrimp with garlic  butter. Steak was perfectly done medium rare. The bartender was very focused on customer service and it was very clear that he is an experienced foodie, just like me. We discussed different dishes and spices, and he talked to me about the positive culture of the Longhorn Steakhouse and the low turnover rate of those that work there. I watched him as he prepared to go sacks of food for several patrons. I observed the interactions as he worked with each customer, and how he left a positive impression with each of them. You could tell he really enjoyed what he was doing, and it showed in his enthusiasm with all he was doing. So many times, you don't see that in people who work in the industry. Between the food, the conversation, and the friendly atmosphere I experienced in there I give it a solid 5 stars. I will be here all week. I may just have to visit again before I fly back to California!"}
{"text":"I had a good steak at a good price.  I like longhorn because you can get bacon and eggs on any steak, just ask for the rancher.  The service was good, and I had a decent glass of wine.  The food is consistent and at a decent price."}
{"text":"Steaks are awesome.  Save room for the brownie sundae.  Ask for Sammie.  She was a great waitress."}
{"text":"Wow! My fiancé and I ordered Flo's Filet while my daughter had the kids sirloin--both were fantastic! Excellent wines as well. The Key Lime Pie was the best I've ever had! But the real reason for the five stars was because of our superb waitress named Antionette. She was the finest server I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She was extremely charming and sweet. Longhorn Steakhouse should be extremely proud to have her!"}
{"text":"Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.

I had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.

Personally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.

Definitely will be returning to this location."}
{"text":"First time to Longhorn. Employees are all very friendly and efficient. DW had prime rib and said it was wonderful. Good taste and very tender. I had ribs and they were good as well.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"First time in a Long Horn, stopped for nourishment after an arduous time picking out paint for the kitchen cabinets. Got seated pretty quick but our server was captive to a long and pointless anecdote a couple tables away... When she finally got free \"J\" was courteous and efficient. Got the tea and water + fruit out promptly followed shortly by the trough of onion things, cool crisp salads and warm crusty bread were up next with meats and sides arriving to a properly busy table.
Breaded onion petals in a long dish with drizzle and dipping sauce make for a happy how do you do while figuring out the entre. Dinner salad with Italian on the side; bright greens + carrots + onions + cheese + croutons for color and texture. Little loaf of bread came to the table with a knife indelicately stuck through it; warm with a good bite and pronounced wheatiness. Nice rendition of a  Delmonico ribeye - cooked extra medium and seasoned with a measured hand - and rice Pilaf that wasn't been cooked to mush. Probably should have had a more serious libation than Berried Sangria but there's a chill in the air and a song in my heart..."}
{"text":"To cut to the chase, I have to inform all readers that Longhorn Steakhouse did provide me a gift card to come back, experience the restaurant and write a review. I don't always write a review after one visit but will do so in this case. It would be nice to come back to check the place out again as my experience this time was mediocre.

That said, the food was almost flawless. They bring bread and butter to the table before the meal. The bread had a good crunchy outside and soft inside. However the flavor left a bit to be desired. Not bad but nothing to write home about - plenty of steakhouse chains with better bread. I gotta admit, I'm not a huge fan of steak. I don't even eat beef often these days. However, my visit with Yelp elite to a different Longhorn for a private event left me rather impressed with their ability to season a steak. Nonetheless, I didn't get a steak this time. Instead I settled for the tilapia over rice with broccoli as a side. This was flawless. Not overcooked (mistake numero uno for most restaurants serving fish) and seasoned to near perfection. The rice was rice. Like the broccoli it tasted a bit watered down but neither were horrible. My starter was a salad with blue cheese and I had no problems there.

My girlfriend stuck with the theme and got a steak medium rare. I never go less cooked than medium on mine. I tasted hers and didn't like it. Most notably, it just wasn't seasoned the way I'd experienced at the private event I attended before. It was bland. She liked it though so...who am I to judge? She got a starter salad and a lobster chowder which I thought was underwhelming. But again, she and I have hugely different tastes and she like it. The craziest thing about this was that her meal was the $13 dinner deal. That's a seriously good deal. The problem I saw was that Longhorn doesn't have any substitution options for this. They really ought to add a chicken breast to the list of proteins. Right now it's only steak. The server said that he'd never heard anyone ask for a substitution before. I believe it - most people come here for steak. Meanwhile, I paid $5 more for my meal.

Aside from the exterior appearance of the restaurant and the way it felt a bit dead inside (weeknight), service was the most unimpressive thing for me. Our waiter probably shared no greater than 50 words with us. When he brought things to our table he never said anything. And never said \"I'll be right back with that\" etc. to indicate if he was going to get something or come back. Even with the check he was not talkative. No \"thanks have a good one\". It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't seem annoyed when I tried talking at length with him about how to run the bill (it had a gift card with a limited amount that you had to type in exactly).

In the end, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants. These days I eat out less and less. I'm also not always impressed by steakhouses. I don't plan to come back here but it's not a total write off. It's simply not a top-of-my-list type of place."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken and Strawberry salad,  the chicken was moist and cooked to perfection.  The salad was so fresh I didn't have to used salad dressing.  
Great place, great service, our server was so personable it was a pleasure to be there."}
{"text":"Delicious Bread, descent prices. Very nice decor. Prime rib was perfect a tad fatty. Horseradish was Not traditional it was a mixture. Chili cheese fries-Amazing; Shockingly good. Lobster was juicy and succulent."}
{"text":"We've only been to any Longhorn Steakhouse once and that was in California several years ago. I remember not being overly pleased but decided to give the chain another try.  I was certainly glad we did.

Our server was fantastic and the meal absolutely delicious.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection.  They were tender and very well seasoned.  At our table there were three of us ordering with a prime rib, a filet and a ribeye steak for lunch.  We all praised the steaks.  They were actually the best we'd had in a mighty long time.  

The salads were excellent and we loved the salad dressing.  I guess that just about covers it.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"We order the jalapeño shooters to start. They are delicious. The steaks are juicy and cooked to perfection.  I must said I went with the whole family including a 6 month old,the place is great,not loud at all. Yes I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of our local lunch stop options where we can typically get in and out within the hour we are given.

They have a great lunch menu with combo options to help save a buck or two. I've never had anything bad at Longhorn especially on the aforementioned lunch menu. Salads are always cold, crisp and green. The complimentary bread is always piping hot!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tenders, and was not impressed. Overall tender lacked seasoning,crispness and was dry. Wife enjoyed her Parmesan chicken. Slow service, has left me parched awaiting refill's.Child's cheeseburger came out as a hamburger and had to be sent back for cheese."}
{"text":"There was a time when it seemed that about every other block had one of these fast-casual steakhouse restaurants. Times have changed, and now it's only every other, other block. In between you now have a slightly upper scale steakhouse. Even the old man on the block, Outback, is upping their game.

Enter the LongHorn. Rather than the casual style where you eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor (which can certainly be awesome), and watch a couple of the waitstaff half-heartedly throw themselves into a boot-scoot boogie every few minutes, they instead decided to make things a bit nicer.

The steaks are certainly nicer on the inside, as well, with better finishes and a decided lack of neon to boot. Service can be hit-or-miss, though after a couple of years, the staff at this location seems to have settled into their stride a bit better than when they first opened. It's a solid option."}
{"text":"We were seated at a dirty table and it took at least five minutes for someone to come get our drink order. We ordered everything at once. Food was good although the salad looked like a monkey threw it together. My prime rib was excellent. 
The service could have been a little better but we will come back, at least until there is a real steak house in Surprise."}
{"text":"I recently went to LongHorm with my family and we were all very disappointed. We've been here many times but they definitely dropped the ball this time for many reasons. 

1. It wasn't even busy yet it took 66 minutes for us to get our food.

2. Once the food came, they delivered a Flat Iron steak instead of a Filet to my father. 

3. I ordered a plain sweet potato and they brought a fully loaded one. 

4. My 8 oz filet I ordered (was supposed to be medium) came out the rarest I've ever seen. Normally this wouldn't bother me as much but it was cold and not seared/unevenly cooked.

5. They brought my sweet potato back out and it was extremely hot, yet hard. I think they overcooked it.

6. They brought my steak back out and half of it was well done and the other half was still rare. I ate it anyway as at this point it was 1 and a half hours. 

What really made matters worse, I tried to voice my concern and the waitress said she'd get a manager (keep in mind I didn't ask for anything). 15 minutes went by and she said the manager changed the ticket from the filet to the Flat Iron and left it at that. When I voiced my concern I wasn't trying to get a huge discount or free shit but to be heard and make sure I wasn't charged for things we did not receive. I was not heard and I truly feel like the family dinner was a complete waste. We would have had a more enjoyable experience going to Outback or Logan's. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was me and my husband's first time ever at a LongHorn. I was pretty surprised at how busy it was for a late dinner. We were told it was going to be a 30 min wait unless we wanted a high top at the bar. We opted for the high top. Service was pretty slow but I can tell the guy was pretty weeded. 

We started off with the firecracker chicken. They were good but very salty. I wish it was a tad crispier. My husband got the prime rib. The cut of it was great and it was medium rare just how he wanted. I got the chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce with mashed potatoes. The chicken was ok but super bready and very crunchy. The mashed potatoes were pretty bland and I wish I opted for a different side item. 

Overall, the experience was ok. I wouldn't mind going back and getting the prime rib."}
{"text":"A group of us had lunch yesterday. Our server, Johnny, was awesome. He took our orders by memory, he knew what was on the menu and he was friendly.  There was a good selection on the menu without being overwhelming. People like him make me want to come back with friends."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fairly priced. Good selection. Good seafood too. Great service. We go every week."}
{"text":"Great tender juicy steak,my favorite spot for meat and potatoes;)I stopped by for my late lunch and good service"}
{"text":"Delicious Spicy Calamari appetizer and hug portion too
Their steak cooked perfectly soo tasty"}
{"text":"Very good experience!

This restaurant is located right off the highway but as you drive up the location is really attractive. Nice landscaping.

We were greeted promptly and seated in a spacious, well cushioned booth (my pet peeve is lack of cushioning). I was a happy camper.

Our waitress was handling our entire section and a large party in the center with a smile and complete confidence.

She took the time to tell us about new offerings and the best way to order the items we chose, she was great.

The manager stopped by several times just to check in. Everyone in the restaurant was feeling the love. Smiles!

At our table, we started with  salads and broccoli and cheese soup. For entrees we had steaks, mashed potatoes, and sweet potatoes; Napa Chicken, spinach, sweet potatoes; and spinach, longhorn macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes as an entree.  Everything was cooked to perfection and served hot.

I know it's a chain but we loved it and we felt catered to by the management and staff.

Great steakhouse with attention to detail."}
{"text":"We were a group of 15 adults plus 11 kids, food was good though they overcooked some items--which they corrected once pointed out. The servers were very corteous and attentive. Only flaw was that they did not want to separate checks when ordering even when we asked them to stating \"oh, no worries we'll sort it out at the end\".  Well, its been over 46minutes!!!!!! since we all finished eating and the checks are still not divided. Sooo, if you are coming in a group where check is going to be split, DEMAND that they split it at the time you order!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Longhorne and sat at the bar.  Erin was our bartender and server. She was very good, friendly and efficient. Our food was just what we expected, basic, good meat, veggies. Seasoned but not over seasoned.  This is a good place close to home to go when we want something good at a fair price."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good
Much better than expected from a chain
Nice sized, well prepared portions. 
Better than competitive chains"}
{"text":"We prefer to support small businesses but we received a gift card from Longhorn at Christmas. We called ahead to put our name on the list. I asked what the wait time was. The lady said \"20-25 minutes\". I thought that was perfect because it would take us that King to get there. We walked in and I have my name. The young lady found my name on the list and then said \"it will be a few minutes\".  I asked how many minutes and she said \"20-25\". I was like \"what?\" but moved to the side to wait. It was literally 20 minutes later before we were seated. 
Once seated it took over 10 minutes before a waitress came. It was another 10 minutes to get our drinks. 
Our food came and neither of is were thrilled with our food. My steak was good but I didn't like the seasoning on my greenbeans and the mushroom risotto had a very weird taste. My husband was not happy with how his steak was cooked. The Mac n cheese was very dry and the broccoli was bland. The only thing he liked was the rice that his steak sat on. 
It was just a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Fiesta mall is closing Best Buy is gone, Sears has. Store closing sign... long horn will be gone soon. 35 Min ticket times for a party of 5. There are 8 other parties here in the building  right now. Come on Joh Taffer! Please step ya burger game up! Man looked like my 12 yr old cousin made it! Straight buns from Albertsons... you also for for our steamed veggies..
2 orders and you bumped into my 2 week newborn  babygirl in her car seat in the sling you provided... clearance brother.. round about... check ya circumference... my pops ordered a prime rib which was not roasted as a professional should. Something happened today.. wish it woulda been better... sorry longhorn take the loss on this one."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and was almost worth the 2 hr wait. Apparently our order got lost and the way they handled it was horrible. The manager was so rude. And after waiting almost 2 hrs for our food it comes out completely wrong. My steak was overcooked like it was sitting there. So I had to send it back and by the time it came back the rest of my group was done eating. Never coming back to this location ever!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Maureen was wonderful, witty, and beautiful. Steak cooked to perfection. Baked potato to die for. Wine was also great. Bud Light was fantastic. Dessert was delectable. The shalack on the table was super shiny. The water probably would have tasted good if I were to have taken a swig. Manager Claudia was super friendly and a smart cookie to boot. Well run restaurant. Best steak in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for dinner since this location opened over the last year or so.   Recently tried the Call-Ahead reservation on a busy weekend night.  Worked like a charm and we were seated immediately.  We also had very attentive wait service throughout.  

Yes, this is a chain so if you're looking for the up class (up price) steakhouse, there are plenty of other options elsewhere.  For a chain, it is what it is and I think generally Longhorn does a pretty good job.  And for the $, I think it's a decent value.

I had the flat-iron steak w/ a stuffed portabella mushroom on top.  The mushroom was small but flavorful however I did not realize the steak would come smothered in béarnaise sauce.  Ugh!  If a steak comes covered up in some kind of sauce, I figure they are trying to hide something.  Anyway, I scraped the sauce off and found the steak.  It was quite good after all that.  Meal rounded out w/ a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad.  The bread basket was also tasty - hot and crusty.

They offer some kind of e-club and you get a free appetizer for signing up so that might be something to consider in the future.  

One note on the steaks, they are heavily seasoned (\"bold & spicy\" or some such).  If you are not a fan of heavy pepper, they will gladly leave it off or lightly season.  I'll try to remember that for the sauce next time."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with 3 stars! I'm not a big steak fan, so I tend to try their other entrees. This last time, I had the half rack ribs with 6oz sirloin special and thought it was quite the bargain for $22 with a side, salad, and unlimited bread. Definitely came home with some leftovers.

Quality of food is fine, typical of the similar tier American steakhouses like Outback, etc. The service met my expectations. Again, this is a place for a simple steak night out without breaking the bank and not high end servers with fancy wine connoisseurs. We were even dressed in workout clothes. Will be back for the occasional steak/ rib dinners but somewhere else for a special occasion ambience."}
{"text":"We went here last week for a Yelp Elite event and it was so amazing, so since we lived right down the road, I thought I would take my husband back for dinner after shopping with me all day!  We went in and it was suprisingly crowded for a Sunday.  We sat at the bar and our bartender Jasmine was so welcoming and sweet!  We started with the appetizer sampler and it came with stuffed shrooms, chicken roll up things, and fried shrimp.  It was all delicious but I think the mushrooms were my favorite!  We then moved to the wedge salad, which is delicioussss!  Their blue cheese is home made and you can tell a huge difference!  

Their steaks are delicious and seasoned wonderfully.  I also had a nice glass of cab with dinner (and extra 2 dollars and you can get 3 more ounces!)  Overall it was a wonderful dinner and Jasmine enhanced our whole experience.  With her adorable southern accent and her professional attitude while dealing with a....difficult customer...A really great steakhouse option that is close by and really making a splash in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"I was in town from Atlanta and both the day and night shift bartenders were a delight!!! Food fresh and delish.  Drinks yummy."}
{"text":"Last time when I was there I got A LONG BALCK CURLY HAIR IN MY FOOD!!!! of course they replaced the meal but I can still fee it that horrible feeling in my mouth. I mean I want to vomit every time I pass that place. Oh and I saw a guy working in the kitchen with a goatee ( long black curly hair)"}
{"text":"Awful. The prime rib was dry and cold and tough. Yuck. Service was slow and inattentive. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was a bit disorganized, but I thoroughly enjoyed my Steak Frites New! Sliced tender flank steak with rosemary bordelaise sauce served over parmesan garlic fries! Delicious! Eating the fries under the bordelaise sauce was like a wonderful poutine! I would definitely order again for $14.99."}
{"text":"It's my first time here! I loved the atmosphere inside, very cozy and comfortable for family's dinner or even for romantic dinner.

The services were great, quick, and friendly. They all very informative and knowledgeable.

The outlaw rib-eye was very soft and tender in my mouth and still have flavor of their signature seasoning. Tips: if you can't handle little bit salty taste in your seasoning, you might want to taste the sample of their seasoning first and they willing to make the lighter seasoning for you.

The mixed green salad was very fresh and crunchy, which is very rare for steak restaurant to have that. The hand-battered Portobellas is my favorite. The flavor is enough to taste and still not losing the original flavor of the mushroom. 

The roasted tomato basil soup was a-must-try soup. It was delicious! Very fresh and have a great balance. 

The coconut margarita was one of of my favorite drink. 

Overall, I really love to go back to try something else and really recommended this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food & Service! We were even given complimentory sundaes to share at our special celebration!"}
{"text":"BEST PORTERHOUSE AROUND!  NICEST STAFF!!!!  This place deserves the shout.  For around $26.00 (I think) you get the best flavored Porterhouse steak in the valley, along with a salad and side.  I don't know what they use to flavor this steak but it has my mouth water now just thinking about it.  Flavorful, tender and AMAZING!  Their baked potato comes fully loaded, which I recommend.  Their broccoli cheese soup is THE BOMB as well.  Their desserts are decadent and they have a really good margarita on the rocks that comes with fresh blackberries and blueberries.  Definitely try this place!  Host Lexi and server Sabrina are rock stars!  Can't wait to go back to this awesome place."}
{"text":"I've always liked Longhorn.  We used to go when we lived in Savannah, GA, and when the one opened up in Madison, we were very excited.  I had the sirloin (Medium) and it was delicious, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  The Western Chili Fries are AWESOME and you get an entire plate of them.

It did bother me that we called ahead and had a 20 minute wait when we got there.  It wasn't busy at all (4:30pm) and there were at least 10 tables open that could have accommodated us.  I have no idea why they made us wait so long.  When you have children (5 and 6), it is tough to wait 10 minutes, let alone any more, before they get antsy and rambunctious.

My wife also had the sirloin (Medium) and loved it.  The cheesecake dessert with ice cream is excellent, so try and save room.  We've been here a lot before and one of our friends once got the 7 Layer Chocolate Cake.  It was enough to feed at least 3 people.

Great food and one of the best chains out there.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! Do not attempt to eat here with a large party! I would have given them zero stars if the option were available.  We called for reservations 3 days ago and we were told they don't take reservations, even though we have a party of 12.  They advised us to call ahead but only 1 hour before our desired dining time.  We called at 5pm as instructed. Finally seated at 7:10 pm.  Their excuse....Company policy, they cannot push tables together.  Another warning....They Need To Clean Their Bathrooms!  When your feet stick to the floor, you know it's not clean.  I wonder what  their kitchen looks like?!?!  Happy Wedding Anniversary to us...this was the worst."}
{"text":"Mmmmm the best steak house in Surprise. Average priced food and beverages. I feel like a upscale cowboy when I've been there. Wish my house was decorated as beautiful. Oil paintings and copper sculptures with a lot of fine wood make this place look very classy. I usually get the rib eye steak or prime rib there and it's delicious and enough for 2. I've tried a few appetizers and they were v-good as well. The booths are spacious, easily accommodates a group of 4. Waiter s/Staff are hard working and accommodating. Can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other and day and expected much more for a $50 lunch for 2. Food was ok, expected more; my server didn't seem very friendly, she might've been having a bad day. Not a bad place to eat but not exactly a personal choice for a steakhouse restaurant."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why you would tell a party that it's a 15 mins wait which then turns into a 45 mins wait AND it was call ahead but somehow other big parties were going before us... the hostess should've just told us how long the wait really was instead of beating around the bush... never again will we come to this longhorn."}
{"text":"It's was good. The steak was right and the Mac and cheese was amazing!! Service was okay.The Service brought this to a 3 because it was slow-ish."}
{"text":"Much better decor since the building was rebuilt after fire. Now it's a clearer decent place to eat. Usual chain feel but attentive staff and ok food  there putting in an effort to serve fresh  food"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, and I dine out a LOT!

1. Arrived 8pm on a Sunday. Place was pretty much empty. Maybe 5 tables of people. It took 10 mins to be seated, 8 of that was waiting for the hostess to show up. 

2. Of all of the nice big booths they had, none that were empty were clean and they put us at a round table in a not so great spot (couple people hit our chairs or pocketbook going by). We were a party of 3 adults and 3 little kids. We were there for the 7 year old's birthday dinner. 

3. It took forever for the waitress to appear. 

4. It took forever to get our drinks. To compare. Another table came in after us and already had their appetizer before we got our drinks!! 

5. She also lied and said you didn't serve chocolate milk (when I know for a fact that you do). AND she served my water with a globby brown thing on the rim. AND served the little kids' milk in these giant glass mugs. They could barely hold them to drink them!! And later she brought them out water in smaller plastic cups with lids. She couldn't do that with the milk?!

6. Our food took forever. That table I mentioned already had their check before we got our food. Our entire visit took 1 hour and 40 mins!

7. While we were waiting, we got to watch as a wine bottle on the wall fell onto a customer. And then our waitress goes over there, tried to put it back on the obviously dubious rack and it falls on him AGAIN!!

8. And then, as she serves that other table their food, she knocks over the woman's martini glass into the man's lap!! She acted like she didn't care at all. Later offered them $5 off their meal. Seriously?!?! Not even a comped drink?!?! The man had to sit and eat in soaking wet alcoholic jeans. Smh. 

9. Her attitude was one of \"I don't want to be here\". Not mean but definitely not friendly. She didn't check on us or our food. Didn't do refills. Didn't bring me a new water. Never brought our missing silverware after asking 4 times! Brought us a nearly empty ketchup bottle and signed when we asked her for some BBQ for one of the kids burgers. She was a woman who hated her job. 

10. We asked if it was possible to get a large cheese fries for an appetizer. She said sure but when I got the check she charged us $10 for a large chili cheese fries. She never mentioned that's what we would be charged for!!!! She could have at least told us it would be the price of the chili ones so we could have picked something else. 

11. I asked for a med well steak. It came out very well done and dry. And the sweet potato wasn't cooked through and hard in the middle and not smooth at all on the softer edges. 

Bathrooms were clean so that was appreciated. But that's about the only good thing I can say about our visit. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Now, it's no secret that Beef N Bottle is my favorite steakhouse in Charlotte. But, if I'm craving steak and don't have the funds for a BNB outing, this is usually my guilty pleasure choice. 

I always get the same thing: a medium rare ribeye with a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad. I switched it up during my last visit because they had a special grilled corn on the cob. I never get an app here because it's too much food, but I do like their shrimp appetizer. It has cherry peppers and is done in a similar style like the calamari at Capital Grill.

Looking around, I watched our poor server get ran to death by a bunch of super demanding tables. I thought he handled it well. In a perfect world, all people should be forced to work both service industry and retail at some point in their lives so they know how to treat people and also act in public."}
{"text":"We decided to stop at Longhorn today, since we were doing some Xmas shopping in the area, and thought this would be a nice place to tame our appetite.  What a mistake!  My salmon (large portion no less) wasn't much at all, and it was dry.  Not much bourbon flavoring sauce on the fish as well.  Adding to the culinary disaster was the fact that my mac & cheese and rice tasted very VERY sweet, as if someone added extra sugar or some other sweetener to the recipe. And all those undercooked bacon bits in the mac & cheese were disgusting!  Way too many and way too rubbery and chewy!  I am not imagining all this, nor am I into food conspiracy theories.  I have never in my 55 years tasted mac & cheese that made me want to hurl until today!  To add insult to injury, the food here is overpriced.  At least the bread, broccoli, salad, and service was A-OK.  Never again."}
{"text":"I love dining at LongHorn. Sometimes the service could use some work, but the food is always excellent! It is a great place for a quick lunch or a family dinner. My husband go there often on date night."}
{"text":"We choose to come here over any other steak restaurant because we never have to send food back, great service and food always tastes great. This time, was beyond the best service I have ever experience, anywhere. Service is everything to us because you can't find it anymore. Cierra L was amazing. She made us feel welcome and wanted. She was super polite and wanted to let her know she ROCKS. She was taking care of a few larger tables, besides us, and it never even fazed her. Never had to ask her for anything because she was on top of it. FABULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience today but other then that it is a great place to eat for dinner with friends and family"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. We've had horrible experiences and some okay ones. Their worst trend is when the hostesses tell you there is a 15-20 minute wait when the restaurant is 50% empty because they don't have enough waitstaff (yet have three hostesses!). My husband and I have walked out twice because of that - we've both worked many years in food service and have never worked anywhere that does that. Also, there is a tendency of their cooks to undercook steak. I've twice sent back raw meat when I ordered medium steak."}
{"text":"Had to wait approx 20 minutes for a table, and that was no big deal. I did not like that after we got seated it took almost 15 minutes before we got a server so that we could place an order for drinks/food. After ordering the food, server came back and said that the ribs I ordered would be ready in about 25 minutes, and wondered if I wanted to order something else, but I told her I did not have any problem with the wait. Rest of the party decided to have their food brought out when I got my ribs. Got free appetizer for the inconvenience. Ribs I ordered was nothing to write home about. I will stick to steak in the future. Rest of party had Flo's filets, and they were very happy with their food. When I got my water refilled, she gave me soda water instead, which was disgusting. All in all a bad experience. Been at this location before, and never had an issue. I will give them a second chance, but chain restaurants are not the best bet."}
{"text":"Great dinner after a long drive.  We shared a dinner and split a specialty salad.  Deserts are to die for.   However the one we choose was huge."}
{"text":"So let me start off that this was a Birthday Dinner for my husband bad mistake!  The server Ruben was horrible I'm sorry but he couldn't keep up with anything.  Took forever to even get things we had ordered or condiments.  Adv when we sat down this was a birthday dinner.  We had a 13 mo old with us and the waitress put items right in front of him to grab! His burger was forgotten and then made and came raw! The manager tried to make up for the horrible service were given but little too late my husband's birthday was already ruined. Waiter couldn't even split the bill correctly which we told him when we ordered it was separate checks and then he looked at us like we were dumb and cocked his head when we asked for the checks to be split! Husband finally got up and left totally disappointed.  Delayed service all the way around and let me say they were not busy for this to be the issue.  The waiter himself was just slow and not organized at all.  I could keep going on but in all we wont be back. Even our guests were totally upset with the service as well.   Not to this one anyways.  Horrible! Don't waste time on this location go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad service. Stood at the bar for 10 minutes and still never got acknowledged. Some of the most absent minded bar service there is. Food is not worth the price. I know it's a chain but they could do so much better. Chains usually mean some sort of consistently. Not here. Cross it off your list."}
{"text":"I was here today for a team lunch with work. It's a nice place to have a meal where you need to be on your best behavior. Nothing here will encourage you to do any kind of spontaneous nsfw outbursts or actions. Which is a good thing when you're with your boss!

I had the $8 half chicken and avocado sandwich with the shrimp and lobster chowder.  First the chowder because I ate it first. It was simply awesome. It tasted great, was creamy, and a little kick to it.  It was very hot which was very welcome since it was like 10° outside.  Next I ate the sandwich, which uses a flat bread.  It was very tasty. I especially liked the crunchiness of the edges of the flatbread.  

So if you find yourself at Longhorn at lunch, try the 8$ special!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service from our server was also excellent.  Don't remember her name.  Wish I did to give her credit"}
{"text":"The last time we came here for a date night we ended up walking out after 20 minutes of no one coming to our table. We decided to give this location another chance on our anniversary. Service this time around was very good but after 45 minutes of waiting for our steak it came out over cooked. We waited an additional 25 minutes for another steak, which was much better. We also just found out that they no longer serve their signature table side steak sauce and their bread that we loved has changed as well. This was on a Wednesday night they were not that busy. So after one hour forty five minutes we are on our way."}
{"text":"The most recent trip to The Longhorn Steakhouse was to celebrate my oldest son's birthday and have a family night out. The food was fantastic as usuall and our waiter was great. He was fun and very interactive with my 11 yr old teasing and joking around with him. We all had a fantastic meal and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Love heir ribs! I like going to this location, but wait time for a table can take 30min+ sometimes"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and I have to say, that for a chain, it's pretty darn good!  I get the Parm crusted chicken which is Yummy!  My hubby gets steak and it's always prepared perfectly.  The baked potato was \"loaded\" but I'd say lightly so...

The appetizer Firecracker Chicken Wraps is really tasty.  The sauce they use is too hot though, ask for ranch (and their ranch is great!) The ice tea is not watered down and the desserts are pretty good.  The Ultimate Brownie Sundae is HUGE.  More than enough for two, or three...you get the idea.

The service has been exceptional both times and they seem to be sticklers for service...boy that's so nice!  Manager has been present and helping each time we've gone.

Join their club at the website for a free appetizer coupon and go get some grub!"}
{"text":"Mark ordered a medium hamburger and extra extra crispy fries for lunch. I wish I had taken a picture. The burger was rare and the fries were definitely not crispy. The waiter/bartender was good, but it took forever to cook another burger. We waited a long time for the burger. For these huge mistakes, no manager came out, nobody apologized, and we paid full price. The bartender, Preston, was very nice, but we won't be returning. Do they even have a manager?"}
{"text":"This is a belated review but was warranted.  Jen and I have been here a few times and we know it's a chain restaurant so our expectations were realistic.  We came for a quick lunch and were seated right away. We have been here a few times before and have never had any issues. Jen was craving prime rib. She made an error when ordering and ordered the rib eye same as I and although a little surprised when she received her food she ate it anyway. They drowned the steak in a seasoned melted butter that should have been served on the side because it was a little too much. The icing on the cake was my mid rare steak which came out somewhere between rare and raw.  No joke. I like a rare steak but even I couldn't choke this down and hesitantly asked the server to throw it on for a bit longer. Obviously a bad decision. The cook must have been offended because you could tell that all they did was toss it back on the grill, smash it down with a steak weight, and call it good.  I sliced it up in strips and flipped over every other one. Picture is posted. You should get a kick out of it."}
{"text":"\"Just when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!\" - Harry

Long Horn read my Yelp review from our last visit and actually contacted me, apologized for the less than desirable experience, and sent me a gift card.  

Jen and I went to the Long Horn on Alma School in Mesa this time for lunch on a Saturday. Just a little after noon we pulled in and the parking lot had barely a few cars which made me wary because when restaurants are slow is when staff gets \"out of the zone\" and makes mistakes. 

The door was opened for us by the time we walked to the entrance and we were promptly seated. Our server Carlos greeted us shortly. We order the stuffed mushrooms for an app and although we haven't had a bad batch there yet, these were still impressive. Big long plate of shrooms covered in cheese to spare. I even scooped some up to put on my buttered sour dough bread complimentary to every table. Jen ordered a sirloin and I ordered the filet and lobster. Our steaks were perfect. Check out the pics each side is perfectly symmetrical and a perfect medium rare. Not overly seasoned, just right. The loaded mashed potatoes I had as one of my sides were probably the best I have had anywhere since I can't  remember when. Jen is a big asparagus fan and even I could tell the quality of her side was top notch. Thick and green even after being cooked perfectly which just enough crunch left in them.  We ordered the Apple Goldrush for dessert which is best explained as your typical apple pie and ice cream dessert; although not so typical. Miserably full, Jen and I almost polished off the entire dessert it was so good, almost. It could have easily fed four.  The crust was amazing. The pics don't do it justice because we tore into it right away but it's presentation was equal to it's taste.

Highlight of the whole meal was our server Carlos. He was friendly, personable, and spot on with timing.  Hopefully he is in some type of training position to train other servers.  Also, somebody figure out who was working the cook line today and give them a raise."}
{"text":"Horrible wait. Call ahead seating means nothing. Don't waste an evening. Still waiting. 45 minutes and counting."}
{"text":"Veterans Day was understaff lobby was full but too many untidy tables waited 15 to get seated and now 1255 still no food."}
{"text":"Calamari was superb! Also had the 3 cheese pasta with lobster and shrimp. Service was excellent as well. This is a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Decent location if you wanna avoid the mall furball on weekends, I recommend going late afternoon and avoid dinner rush.

Staff is nice facility is clean and food is yummy. But I prefer the Westgate location in Fairview Park since I live around the corner

Must add a note that the server we had tonight spilled a glass of water all over a nice elderly couple at the table behind us, took her a few minutes to clean it up, I felt bad for the nice people who's dinner was interrupted by her clumsiness.
(Please note though that the tables were extremely small also)"}
{"text":"So i do love longhorn, but i feel that its a hit and miss on what you order.. 
The ribeye is ALWAYS great. I get mine extra seasoned because i like the spicy pepper flavor. The ribeye is always juciy and tender, at least when you get it cooked at Med. 
I got the prime rib this time and it was not at all what i was expecting.. in fact i dont ever remember prime rib tasting like sugar? Hmm. I think ill stick to my ribeye..
My server Dale was pretty good. He didnt really bother me too much like some waiters do. What i will say though is he brought my check super early before some of my food came out.. i felt rushed or like he didnt trust that i was going to pay for my food.
Also after bringing my check something i was afraid was gonna happen was they were gonna stop servicing me.. i never got a refill and it took forever to flag him down to bring me a box but i just ended up leaving because i couldnt get a box for 20 min..
Would have loved to take my food home.
A bit disappointed seeing that im a regular customer..
I did try their mixed berry lava cake which was excellent! Very nice and moist. Not too sweet.
The hostess was a bit awkward when i walked in. I guess saying table for 1 was unheard of before? She just kinda looked at me like a deer in the headlights look."}
{"text":"Will never go to another steakhouse! Longhorns steaks are the best. If you want buttery rich melt in your mouth steak this is the place to go. Never have i had a bad experience. I used to be a texas roadhouse lover but Longhorn just puts Texas roadhouse to shame. Forever a fan."}
{"text":"This location is a step above the rest. The last time I visited one of these restaurants, it wasn't the greatest. However, this location has excellent food and even more excellent staff. We had a large party and we were very well taken care of. The food came out promptly and our drinks were always full. Great time!"}
{"text":"Great food but amazing service!  We had 2 of the specials!  Yum stuffed steak with cheese?  Yes please!  But I still can't get passed how friendly the entire staff was!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Ordered online and arrived at the bar at my designated pick up time. Paid and was told it would be a couple minutes. 30 minutes later my food arrived and not once while i was waiting did anyone acknowledge my existence, offer me a drink-nothing. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped into LongHorn the other day because I had a $25 gift certificate and a coupon for a free appetizer or desert.  I had also recently heard about a $29.95 meals for 2 special that they started running.  $5 + tip meal for 2, THAT'S a deal!!

We both decided to go with a spicy chicken roll app which was simple but delicious and both went with the bacon wrapped sirloin with a blue cheese crust.  We both ordered our sirloins medium rare and both came out incorrect.  Although the cut of meat was bigger then the advertised 8 oz., mine came out more rare but still edible and the wife's came out medium.  Flavoring / seasoning was as expected, bacon wasn't crispy like I enjoy, but the veggies that accompanied my meat was fresh, crisp, and cooked / seasoned perfectly.  Alison's (wife) asparagus didn't have the ends broken off, which I though was bush league at best.  Bread was good, beer was cold, wine was reasonably priced.  Finally, for desert, we went with an apple bourbon tart with vanilla ice cream which we both really enjoyed especially since it was free.

I really think that if the steaks were cooked properly and the asparagus wasn't f'd up, then this LongHorns location would have gotten 4 stars.  It is baby friendly for all you parents out there and there was a slight wait at 5pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Give the Southwest Shrimp a try. It is awesome. Steaks were good and chocolate stampeded was very big and very good."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here with only 30 mins till close but we were starving and from out of town so didn't know our options. Long horn was near our hotel so we went. We were sat right away but waited on a server finally we were given Connie she was a doll. She took our order and brought us our our drinks and salads immediately. Our food was great and she continued to check up on us and made sure we were happy. Thanks so much Connie for taking care of us with it being close to closing time! The manager also stopped by our table to ask how everything was so overall despite the confusion in the beginning it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I was seated in a front booth of the restaurant and sat for 20 minutes and never saw a waitress or waiter at my table. I asked a hostess once after 10 minutes without even a glass of water and was told she would be a minute. I waited another 15 minutes and nothing. I then left and went next door to Black Angus, was seated immediately and waitress took my order and brought drinks immediately."}
{"text":"Our server Hannah was so entertaining. Exactly what we needed after a long week. I got the sirloin  and grilled shrimp and it all went perfectly together!! I'll admit i was skeptical about the rice with the shrimp, but it worked perfectly!!! Will definitely be returning, especially for the amazing happy hour specials!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for top shelf food porn and I'll admit, I fell hard for the pictures of the steak sandwiches on the Longhorn website.  So after salaciously ogling the glamour shots of the Tavern Steak sandwich, I acted on impulse and sped off to their outpost near West Towne mall.

When you walk into the recently built restaurant, it's abundantly clear you're in a Western-themed corporate restaurant, complete with the requisite paintings of cowboys and the head of a longhorn steer mounted above the bar.  While the restaurant is clean and exceptionally well maintained, the atmosphere stuck me as sterile.

My server was efficient and polite - no complaints.

Longhorn Steak offers up a plethora of lunch specials for $7, $8 and $9.  I elected to go with the $9 option - my eagerly anticipated Tavern Steak sandwich accompanied by a bowl of French Onion Soup.  

While I've had worse, the tepid French Onion soup certainly did not rock my world.  To make up for a thin broth, the kitchen topped it with a dense layer of cheese that begged for additional time under the broiler to impart more flavor,  While the soup had a healthy dose of onions, they really needed more time in the sauté pan.  I would have preferred a smaller serving of more flavorful soup, just sayin'

When my long awaited Tavern Steak sandwich arrived, I was crest fallen. It was miniscule, served on half of a hot dog bun.   Instead of being topped with a mound of crispy onion straws, my pitiful sandwich had a heap of sad, soggy onion rings.  And instead of an abundance of finely-cooked steak bursting from the sandwich, all of the contents of my meal neatly fit inside the 3 inch hot dog bun.  Curse you, Darden Restaurant Group for your deception, bamboozling me with images of grandeur, then delivering this travesty of a sandwich!!!

But my tale of woe does not end here, gentle reader, for something was awry with that 3 inch hot dog bun.  It tasted like off, like it was placed on a recently cleaned surface and it absorbed some of the cleaning solution.  After two tiny bites, I called by server over, explained the problem, and he promptly replaced my meal with the shaved prime rib sandwich.

While this sandwich also had a wee little bun, the kitchen was significantly more generous with the contents, which like a cornucopia, spilled out onto my plate.  While the onions on my sandwich needed more browning, but they did deliver a kiss of sweetness.  The mushrooms had a gorgeous dark golden hue and intensified the beefy flavor of the tender prime rib.  I was a little gun shy after my experience with my first sandwich, but all in all, I grudgingly must give the prime rib sammie a thumbs up.

I did fill out my customer survey regarding the off-taste of the Tavern Steak sandwich - it's been a couple of weeks and I've yet to receive a reply."}
{"text":"Food was great to bad that it's kinda all was ruined by terrible service I'm not one to complain but the service was bad from the beginning it was 8pm they don't close till 10 pm we got no bread are drinks were poorly refresh at the end the ice tea was basically water towards the end and all we got was its the end of the nigh and we have no more tea umm okay then server was ver hostile when ask if we can have better tea then brought back a tea in a Togo cup umm okay she had founded sitting somehere okay thanks for the found tea still left 15% cuz not douche who just takes it out on a persons living but wish people would do your job still like the food but might not come back as often as I use too"}
{"text":"Mushrooms came out hot but rest of appetizers were cold, dry and salty.   Attended birthday party for 16.  Table ready for 14.  Made us wait 40 minutes for table of 4 next to us to finish.   It is 5:15 and nobody here at Friday evening.  Just add to chairs instead of making us wait.  These people don't really want to sit next to 16 people in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Did not get 2 out of 4 orders correct . Filet and stuffed shrimp , gave us shrimp and lobster Mac . Not good , fishy . May not come back . Waitress Laurie very nice"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I used to love this place. Sadly on my last few visits it has been bad. The service has been less than stellar but even worse, the food has went downhill. I ordered the \"Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breasts\"  it was my fave. Not any more. The portion size has shrunk to nugget size. Literally. It's dry & over salted. The mashed that were once creamy & delicious, were dry & hard in spots. If this were a 1 off, I would let it go. It seems more like a new direction & less like an individual aberration. 

***After writing this review Longhorn has reached out an apologized for both the service & the food. I truly appreciate this as a customer. They assured me that the bumps that I had experienced were being fixed & thanked me for the feedback. I will give them another chance in the future. They seemed sincere. I hope I can come back & update this again...with more stars!***"}
{"text":"Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the \"Sun City rush\" is insane.  The ribs were amazing..."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this Longhorn location. I've been to a lot of steakhouses in my life and to be honest I grill up a pretty incredible steak myself. This place was great!

I came in with my wife for a date night. I got the outlaw ribeye, it was incredible. My wife ordered the T-bone and loved it. The steaks are huge and the seasoning is spot on. If you got one of the cheese toppings I would recommend light seasoning because the cheese toppers are pretty salty on there own. We also enjoyed the longhorn favorites appetizer and loved all 3 items that it came with. I also got a nice tall beer and my wife got the Perfect Margarita. The meal comes with bread and nice little side salad. Zero complaints. I enjoyed every last bit of my meal and my night. The service was great and the food was spaced out perfectly. i highly recommend stopping in next time your craving steak."}
{"text":"Poor service and not great food. Burnt fries and a long wait just to get my drink order taken. The host was a nice guy though."}
{"text":"We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.

When the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.

Worst experience in a long time."}
{"text":"When they can't get something simple like a regular coke with a lemon right, you know it's going to be a long night!"}
{"text":"Wow! I just want to say that this is my very first yelp review and I'm so disappointed that I have a bad review..I ordered the Ribeye medium and it was beyond dry as I let the server know she immediately took my plate to replace it. Not to mention my daughter's steak came out RAW and had to be recooked  and they just through it on the grill cut and served back to her which  is against health policies.... the manager brought me my steak and asked me to cut into it as I did..blood was everywhere as lt was rawl and he ! Smh was upset that I was upset!!!\" Dude I'm not eating a rawl piece of meat\"! Will I go back????Idk"}
{"text":"I was visiting my folks from MI. And I had two choices: Longhorn or Logans. I've been to Logan's and they cannot cook a steak. So, we went to Longhorns. And it was pretty darn good. Steak was delicious, service was pretty good, broccoli was yum. I liked the look. I left a happy camper."}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my wife, my buddy and his girlfriend while we were out in Phoenix for Dodgers spring training and had the worst experience ever.  The service here is a joke and the food is not that much better. After we were seated it took 20 minutes before we were acknowledge by our waitress. When she came over she started joking that she was on break and no one told her that we had been seated. We saw at least 4 different waiters/waitresses pass us by and they just looked at us. 

After we placed our order we received our food promptly but everything was mediocre. My steak was lukewarm at best and under seasoned. Would it hurt them to use a little salt and pepper? My wife steak was overcooked. My buddy and his girlfriend disordered steaks and they had better luck. The on ok y good thing was the bread, it was served warm and tasted good."}
{"text":"Our service was...unfortunate. We waited 15 mins before my hubby got upset and complained that our waitor had not greeted us. It still took him another 5 mins after that to come to our table. Our food order was wrong...hubby got a big ol slab of a steak with a tiny fruit cup as a side, which was hilarious. He was supposed to get mashed potatoes and he also never got his ceasar salad.  I think the waitor was having a bad day bc he was apologizing to all of the tables. This being said, the food was AMAZING, we really could not get over how delicious it all was. The manager, Brent, knew of our situation and compensated some of our bill and also hooked us up with an amazing dessert. This was unnecessary but appreciated. He came by a couple of times to apologize. Despite the unfortunate service, I'd like to still give 5 stars for tact in handing the situation and also the food I can't stop thinking about. I'll assume it was just a bad day for service and will def come back to try again. We tipped the waitor 30% thinking other tables prob gave no tips, hopefully it helped turn around his day a little"}
{"text":"Most of the food was great. One of the party of 4 had a bad steak, Sirloin Fillet, cooked med/rare was salted to death...yucky. Manager seen my brother gagging on the steak, came up and asked what's wrong. He explained the steak was over salted. Manager says some bs about \"here we use a really bold seasoning\" and this specific steak gets 2 coats of our bold seasoning\". He would have sent it back, but with the horribly slow service we already had. Bread brought out when appetizers were finally cooked and served, salad 2 mins later, so we were overwhelmed with plates all of a sudden. Our server seemed to be running the bar, register, phone, and select tables (with others including the manager serving her stuff and of course they have no idea who ordered what). We all finish eating, wife asks for her desert (ordered at the beginning of the original order). Server says ok, and like usual she dissapeared to company phone and bar. About 5-10 minutes later she returns with her desert (all other waiters/waitresses) were serving there own tables around us flawlessly. Hate listening to managers lie. Good managers fix the problem and make the customer hsppy, not make bs excuses. Still tipped her 15% which she did not deserve. Peace Out."}
{"text":"Start with the good news:

The Watermelon Salad with grilled chicken was very good. It's a \"summer season special\" and was attractive, tasty and well priced. I'd recommend it highly.

The rest of the visit:

I sat at the bar, which I typically avoid, and waited almost 5 minutes before the bartender, Anne B. approached for my drink order. My place at the bar wasn't ready for a guest: peanut shells, dirty glass from a previous guest, paper from a straw. She returned with my drink and a menu (left it on the bar upside down) and walked away without comment. Bright spot: Anne was able to accurately describe the dressing. While the bartender left the bar for a short while (potty break I guess?) Adrian approached my place and quickly recognized the clutter. He was very pleasant and conversant and was, without question, the best staff member I encountered. 

The delivery of my entrée was also interesting...kinda slid in from the side by a server who made no comment at all. Very weird. Nevertheless, the food was good as mentioned above. 

Bartender dropped the check (also \"wrong side up\"), picked up my card (both without comment and never asked about dessert). I left wishing Adrian would have been my server for the entire meal. By the way, two separate couples left seats adjacent to me without being served. And, an area of the bar (some sort of low seating) was a mess with old newspaper, paper and rags. The remainder of the restaurant appeared to be clean. Terrific food which was \"diluted\" by really poor service...an obvious result of poor training/follow up. Please don't make my mistake and sit at this restaurant's bar but do try the Watermelon Salad!"}
{"text":"I always have a wonderful experience when I come here. Food is always wonderful and the service staff is awesome! They are a little pricey, but it is a steak house and we expect that when we go a steak house. Honestly always a nice place to go for a date night or family dinning experience."}
{"text":"We sure do love the Longhorn! Food and drinks are amazing. Bar service is prompt and attentive. Jessica is such an amazing bartender. Extremely proficient. Very friendly. We will be back specifically to see her!!"}
{"text":"filet was over cooked and wasn't worth the $$$$ price.  No Thanks...  The second time that I was talked into going back..... was a big mistake."}
{"text":"It was on the pricey side I thought.  Long wait, but understand.   Great waiter, only problem husband didn't asked how he wanted his filet and it came rare.  Very rare.  He ate it!!!  Wondered why he didn't ask me if I wanted a bite.  Glad he didn't!"}
{"text":"Flavorful steaks at this location.  A bit dry and not so tender, but still delicious.  This is coming from someone who doesn't care for steak for these reasons alone.  The mashed potatoes I were served had a tablespoon of refrigerated butter in the middle.  It caused the potatoes to become kind of greasy and the excess butter ran all over my plate.  The skin on the baked potato was extra crispy, someone could have made potato skins with it!

Our server mentioned she works approximately four hours a week.  Why she told me this?  I'm not sure.  To get more tips?  Sorry, hon, that tactic won't work on me.  Service was a bit slower than the others who were seated around me.  A couple who ordered after I received my salad received their entire meal before I received my entree.  I'm actually thankful for that otherwise I would have felt rushed.

Even though service was \"slower,\" I found it to be a blessing in disguise.  The timings were perfect and my server earned her tip since she was attentive and predicted my needs.

I love the blue cheese dressing here!  This is also one of the few restaurants I know to serve French dressing."}
{"text":"Slow and inattentive service. Tonion was subpar and probably frozen.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and our server Riley was great! Merlot mushrooms are a must on your steak and the sauce they come in went so well with the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I feel like if you go somewhere like Long Horn, you shouldn't be expecting anything top of the line in terms of food. Any sort of franchise restaurant like this is pretty run of the mill. The staff was incredibly friendly. Got seated immediately. It was around 2pm on a Saturday, not busy at all. I ordered a 10z New York strip with a loaded baked potato and a side of rice pilaf. The food came out within 10-15 minutes. The steak was okay. There was a ton of fat. I would say it was at least 50% fat on the steak. I will eat the fat, but I, as most do, enjoy meat more. I got the steak medium well and it was cooked perfectly. The potato wasn't very warm, so the butter and sour cream never really fully melted. Just kinda gelled to the bites of potato. The rice pilaf tasted and was cooked excellently. All in all, I knew what I was getting into before I came here and didn't leave WOWED, nor did I leave disappointed. It was just kinda \"eh\" , but sometimes that's alright."}
{"text":"First off, the sanitation rating is 99.5.  Love to see that.  

We sat at the bar and had great service.  

We ordered a T-bone steak and a sirloin salad.  Everything about our dinner was great.  The food came out hot.  

They also offer flavored teas.  The peach is the best."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Come here every Friday and the waitress was just horrible tonight. 2 hours for 7 of us to eat. Never any bread brought to the table. Appetizers and salads brought at the same time as the food. Over 20 minutes to get out bill then it was wrong. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my birthday and had a great dinner. I signed up on line a few days ago, after readind many good reviews, for a membership and recieved a text for a free appatizer. The staff and food was excelent. I have gone to several of the high end steakhouses in Phoenix and Scottsdale and Longhorns steaks are right up there with the exspensive places. I had the Porterhouse medium and it was perfect. My wife had the ribs and she said they were delicious and fell of the bone. My son had the calimari and French onion suop and raved about how the calimari was crispy and the soup fresh with just the right anount of cheese. I highly recomend this location in Mesa. Oh and I called in when I was leaving my house about 56 minutes fron the restaurant and gave them my name. when we arrive we went right to our table. to my supprise they brought me a complementry ice cream sunday."}
{"text":"We did call ahead seating like their yelp account suggested, they said 25-30 min wait. We show up 25 mins later and they said the wait will still be 25-30 mins (what's the point of call ahead seating). The waiter was super weird and forgot our bread so we had to ask for it.  Then he sat the water pitcher on the bread at one point. Weirdest part he shook our hands at the end to thank us for coming in, dead hand, while looking away... please dont tell your servers to shake guests hands. Anyways it was pricey for the quality. The steak the waiter recommended (the sirloin) was too chewy to even eat! I'll be taking it home for the pups. Really disappointing experience."}

{"text":"The bread was AMAZING!  I could eat it all day.  The fried pickles were crunchy. The Caesar salad was all fluff.  The sirloin steak tasted like a Sizzlers steak, if anyone remembers that chain. The mashed potatoes were fine. The key lime pie was tasty, but it was all fluff too (mostly whipped cream)."}
{"text":"The service is some of the worst that I've ever had. There were very few patrons in the restaurant. It took forever to get the food. The menu did not list all of the ingredients on the salad. There were items on the salad that I was allergic to and had to have a new salad made. I do agree it was my error in not asking if there was other fruit on the salad. However when it states a strawberry salad, one does not expect it's going to be having citrus fruit as well.

We had to wait to get any refills on drinks.

The shrimp and lobster chowder was just okay.

We then had to flag down the server to bring our bill. There were multiple groups at the table. We requested separation of the bills. Then, even when separating out for the server cash and a card and advising the server of one person paying cash and the other person paying with card for each of their respective meals. The server still got it wrong. As we had to leave in order to be somewhere else on time we could not wait for the server to correct it. We just handled it ourselves.

I can say I was not impressed with the food nor with the service. I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I had a great steak, baked potato,  salad. Joe, our waiter was great. All the bad reviews are wrong, this place is great! Outlaw Ribeye was the suggestion he made, and our whole party had it. They have a macaroni and cheese dish that is really good."}

{"text":"My wife and I  been here 4 times now.  Each time, the food was great.  Waiters and waitresses have been good 3 out of 4 times.  The 4th was just slower to service table, but not to the point of making it a bad experience.  The steaks have all been tender and cooked just right.  The 33oz porterhouse for 2 was great!  It can get busy, so we always make reservations to avoid the wait."}

Not our first visit so we're very disappointed.
Thanks"}
{"text":"Always had good meals at other Longhorns. Stopped here in February - not disappointed. 
This time 7 June very disappointing. We sat at bar for beer and food. Bar was only half full, but took forever just to get menus and drink order. Bar itself was filthy. Had to ask for it to be wiped,,,not really good. Wife had the grilled shrimp -  hot and tasty. I had a half rack of ribs. Real fatty and greasy. ugh...
BTW the AC was so intense even I was freezing....come on. Not comfortable at all. 
Maybe try one more time,,,but beware."}
{"text":"A party of two arrives for dinner. We are told that we are being seated away from a big group also dining in tonight. 
We should have left. It didn't even cross our minds that this would make our dinner a disaster. 
Our waitress was the second problem. She may have just been a bad server, but it seemed like she was drunk. At one point during our meal she was holding the sweet tea pitcher, which I never got a refill of, and walking back and forth from the kitchen over and over. She did not have the big party in her area. She had 4 tables and kept calling me sweetie, which was annoying for some reason. I complained about our service to her directly, and she said \"would you like the manager to come over?\". Manager never came over to us. 
Basically our food sat in the kitchen until it was cold and then another server brought our entrees first followed 5 minutes later by cold soup, 1st and 2nd time out, and salads. Steak had no char on outside, cold soup, salad was sloppy,and bread was cold. It is always served warm with butter. On one positive note the chicken tenders seemed to be prepared well.  
I do believe this was a management problem. I don't think this evening we were the only ones experiencing this issue. 
On my previous dinner experience at this Longhorn I had a wonderful server and a delicious filet and lobster tail. We did dine at an off hour of 4:00pm that evening. 
I will have to think a bit before I return at regular dinner time to this longhorn. I may sit in the bar if I do. Many times the bartenders take better care of you. 
Just over all I think the manager should have been there to help his servers when a big group is there. The regular sized parties should not have to suffer."}
{"text":"Our experience wasn't great. Food took extremely long to arrive at the table. The orders were messed up. The server was very slow in getting anything done efficiently. The food in general was above average and the manager on duty (maybe the location GM) was very understanding and addressed our complaints well and fairly. Even getting out check took 20 minutes from start to finish. We would not come back again to this location. We've lived here 14 years and never thought of going before now. Unfortunately it will be another decade before amnesia sets in and we revisit the place."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries. Add a cold beer to it and youre set! if you drink that is. :)"}
{"text":"Went for date night, and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Although the waitress forgot to bring my wine, she made it up to me by giving me extra. Would definitely go back as we really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Nice clean store. We had a very hardy shrimp and clam chowder.  My Sirloin was cooked perfectly and Ant had 2 pork chops the size of ping pong  paddles.  Everything was delicious  and our waitress, Samantha was very nice."}
{"text":"Great food and service  for a restaurant that's only been open for a month. This is a can't miss for Chandler"}
{"text":"Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)

It was clean and the service was good but, the food was medicore at best. If you can't have a great cheeseburger at a steak house then you have problems."}
{"text":"This place was great for my son's dinner. The appetizers were very good especially the smoked wings and the chili cheese fries were very tasty as well. We were not dis appointed here."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good atmosphere, good service. Steak temps could use some work though. Mine was over, his was under...we both ordered medium rare."}
{"text":"We are new to the area, so we've been trying out the local steak houses. This is the first one we've been to that did not disappoint! We found the menu to be extensive enough to have something other than steak (if you chose, such as chicken or salmon) but with enough variety of different types of steaks, including flat iron, porterhouse, filet mignon and others.

We started our lunch with a tall order of some draft beer on tap (no local draft beers available) and an order of calamari . The appetizer could have easily been a mean in and of itself, and easily enough for four people. The steaks we ordered were cooked exactly as we had requested. We left more than satisfied and didn't feel like we had to borrow from our 401K to eat at a nice place (haha). Service was excellent as well. Four starts (and not five) because the place needs a little updating, that's all. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Eh, another typical steakhouse chain . Food wasn't anything to brag about , it wasn't bad but it wasn't yummy enough to recommend others . Our waiter was good , but the rest of the staff lacked that welcoming touch ."}
{"text":"We came here last Friday for date night and it was perfect! Our server was friendly and took great care of us. We enjoyed our appetizers, drinks, and desserts but... its all about THE STEAK yuummmm!!!
We called ahead and put our name on the list, there was still a bit of a wait when we arrived but worth the wait! Overall a wonderful experience, as date night should be :)"}
{"text":"i have eaten lunch here on two occasions.  both times food took a while to arrive but quality was very good and service was good.  the interior was well kept up and had a nice homey feel."}
{"text":"I had
 the salmon on a bed of wild rice with cream spinach the salmon was flaky and fresh and very good I would order it again"}
{"text":"We were told our table wait would be 1 hour, we ended up waiting 2 hours and not once were we asked if we wanted a menu to look over. We asked how long and we were told 5 minutes at least 4 different times. Our table was for our family to go out that we haven't seen in years and we then had to be sat at 2 different booths. We waited about 15 min before a server came to even greet us. Once the server came over she was very dry and didn't even apologize for the wait or splitting our family. Once we got silverware we unrolled one and there was a long piece of black hair rolled into the napkin. All the hostess said was okay thank you. I ordered a steak and potatoes and the potatoes were cold. The only good thing that happened was I got a second lemonade without asking. Needless to say I will not be returning and I will never ever refer anyone to this location."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had a restaurant in Pittsburgh area thus far. I called and asked to be added to list earlier in the day. While I did under estimate the amount management was completely rude and hostile. We could see it was busy and that we would have to wait but the manager just refused to even be pleasant with us. 

To the food, I personally don't do major chain restaurants but longhorn was being raved about so we decided to go. I asked my server to recommend the best steak on the menu and I ordered it. It was terrible I make better steaks at home in my cast iron. It was no flavor and the mean was not tender at all. 

Overall I will never longhorn again and especially the one in water front."}
{"text":"Forget the \"call ahead\" feature. It's meaningless and a waste of time. Got there at the guesstimate time and still waited another hour to get seated. Hostess was extremely rude. Food took forever to arrive and was cold. Steak was full of gristle, only about half was edible. Fries were soggy. Broccoli over cooked and limp. Overall the food quality was awful. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"For us minions who can't afford places like Sullivan's and Ruth's Chris......this is easily the best steakhouse around. My wife and I have gone to all the other middle class steakhouses (Lonestar, Texas Roadhouse etc.) and this is our favorite. 

The steak is always juicy and cooked perfectly and their sides don't taste like they were nuked in the microwave. 

Try the Rancher Sirloin with the bacons, sunny side egg, and hollandaise. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Had the best night here last night! It started out rocky, sat at outback for 25 minutes with no service so decided to give this place a try. Everyone was so friendly! Our waiter Josh was amazing. He had us laughing, the orders were perfect, over all awesome experience! They definitely gained us as customers!"}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced having take out and being disappointed.  This was our third time we had take out.  Zax at the Bar took our order and had the prior two times.  Zax was SO helpful giving us info and it was one of the busiest days (Fathers Day).  Every time the have packed our order, cooked the food exactly as we asked and all the condiments!  It was as if we were sitting at Longhorn to eat but we were at home.  Cedric the Manager came around to see how we were doing, we gave him a Rave for our experience with Take Out.  Also our conversation with Cedric even impressed us more about the commitment of service and quality of Take Out.  Shout out to the Cooks.  Thank you for great experience not only once but three times now!"}
{"text":"This place was open only two weeks on my visit.  The entire staff was very friendly.  Our group of 4 ordered and one of the meals was incorrect.  Not only did they fix the mistake, they provided an entire additional plate!  The Manager and waitress were outstanding in their service to us, the customer.  We will definitely be returning to try all the entrées!  Great job!  Oh, did I mention all the food was delicious?  :-)"}
{"text":"Probably the best 'non-prime' steaks we've had in the valley.  I had the rib-eye and my wife had the filet, both slightly over cooked but the bark / seasoning is wonderful & they were tender & juicy.  Even though I'm a rib-eye lover, next time I am getting the filet, it was wonderful.

The Texas onion was just okay, no where near as good as Outbacks but acceptable but I dont think I would get it again.

Loved the atmosphere , service was above average & prices are in line.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience tonight at Longhorn! We love the atmosphere and the food is divine. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Our food domes out hot, beautifully garnished, and very flavorful every time we visit!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant A 5 star service in general was excellent, we (family) were sitted sooner that what we expect it, Every thing was Delicious to the appetizer to our salad and the steak was to DIE for YUM!! Delicious Strawberry Lemonade OMG. Our Server was Amazing super nice and the service that she provided to me and my family was Fabulous 2 thumbs Up for Kelsy. Thank you."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers everrrrrr!
Might be a little pricey but reasonable price for each meal. The waitresses are very nice and laid back, joking with us and conversing. Went for a date once and it was a perfect fit of a place for a nice romantic date! They have country music playing too"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  I've delayed writing this review, because frankly, I just haven't had the time required to do it properly.  It would take hours to fully explain the nightmare we had.  To sum it up though, they can't cook a steak.  Mine was completely raw.  Three times. I will add a picture, if I can figure it out.  The worst part though, (and almost humorous) was when my guest got her steak overcooked and she complained that she ordered it rare.  So get this.  They brought back the same steak and cooked it some more.  Seriously!!!   They kept trying to get them right, but just couldn't.  We finally gave up.  The manager insisted we try something else, so we did.  I figured how could they ruin a shrimp cocktail, so that was our choice.  Well guess what?  They could ruin a shrimp cocktail.  I could see them when they were being brought out, that they were slimy and undercooked.  Heck, they were transparent.  How could a manager even come out with that and not notice it, when I could spot it miles away?  The manager was finally appalled himself at how bad it was and that it was happening over and over and over again.  He gave us a gift card to come back, and told us that he wouldn't blame us if we didn't want to, but told us we could use it at one of their other restaurants.   Basically we left without eating, so I really can't review this place, as I don't know how the food is.  I just know how it isn't!"}
{"text":"I know it's a franchise but this place was well run. It's always crowded but they keep it moving. We came before 5pm and sat at the bar. Service was great. My steak was great, cooked to temp. They could use a better selection of sides. And wife said the chicken at Ruby Tuesday's was better. So, I guess stick with the steak."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: the decor/ambiance is fantastic. You're surrounded by dark wood and low lights. The server recognized that I was trying to cut calories on my meal and went more in depth into how my meal was prepared (cheese, croutons, butter, etc). This is much appreciated because sometimes you think you're getting something healthy and then it comes with bacon. At one point, the chef even came out to help customize our orderThe food tasted pretty good but they were out of tilapia.

THE BAD: Although it was nice that they chef came out to speak with us, it became excessive. Our waitress was checking in with us, the chef came out twice, and then the manager stopped by. By the time the manager had come around, we were done talking to people. She didn't have anything to say anyway!. They over did that part. And they were out of tilapia (although they substituted it with salmon)

HOW TO FIX: coordinate with your servers, chefs, managers as to who is going to speak with the customers and how many times each has done so. Keep your fish in stock!

STAY OR GO: I'd go again for a family meal or date."}
{"text":"Steak was not cooked to order.  Server acted like she did not care.  Appetizer to share was small and not that good. Side Mac and cheese was great."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that deserves a round of applause. Great food and great service at prices you can't beat. No wonder the Old Mallard Creek LongHorn Steakhouse is currently no. 2 in customer satisfaction in the country. And I wouldn't be surprised if they take the top spot by the end of this month to be the best in 2014!

Let me start off by saying that there are people who say you have to wait long but no, we just walked right in on a Saturday night even though the place looked packed. They took me and my wife to a nice, comfy booth in the back where I like it, and it looked like it was just cleaned, which means the staff are quite diligent.

Then we met Tim, who helped us out that night. He was awesome! He was quick, smooth, knowledgeable, friendly in a non-creepy-guy way, all throughout the night. He knew when to come to us exactly when we wanted him to, and he took our orders like a pro. By that I mean filling in the gaps like when I said Ribeye, he asked the Outlaw Ribeye. And when I said no, I'm not that hungry tonight, he backed off immediately and said yeah, you need an empty stomach for that. I don't like people who push it with comments like 'you sure?', 'come on buddy!' I want to eat what I want to eat. And I did have the Outlaw Ribeye last time so I wanted to try the regular.

Let me tell you, the price is right! We ordered the Sampler, a Ribeye and a Renegade Sirloin that both came with a side and a salad, and a OMB Southend. All that cost us a little over fifty! You know LongHorn is in the same family as Capital Grille. I say the steak is just as good and the price is half! How about that.

Now the last thing I want to mention is the excellence of the entire staff. The manager who stopped by was friendly, the receptionist, the kitchen staff was obvious good at what they do, and Tim F. were all super. He even got us a desert to make our experience more awesome. So that was our Saturday night dinner that made up for a bad Thanksgiving lunch at Nan & Byron's. So I'd definitely recommend this place to whoever."}
{"text":"I had been hearing quite a bit from family about this place. I had heard over and over about how awesome the mac n cheese was. The biggest reason people had been pushing this place was because of the quality of the steak for the price you pay.

The mac n cheese was excellent! I'm not a fan of the bread crumbs on any mac n cheese, I prefer the smooth & creamy. Despite the use of bread crumbs on their mac n cheese, it was still one of the better recipes that I have had. Not the best, but probably a top 5. The bacon was a nice addition.

Go big on the steak. If you go to a place for a steak & don't get the cut that they say is their best, then you can't pass effective judgement. I went with the rib-eye on the bone, that was the best according to the staff. They were very good about making sure you understood their scale/coloring for cooking the meat. Mine came out a perfect medium. They also took the time to explain that my cut would involve a heavier dose of fat/marbling. I am usually a fan of the fat because it adds flavor and is generally a soft fat that melts in your mouth. The fat on my cut was tougher than I am accustomed to though. There were a few bites with melt-in-your-mouth fat, but quite a bit of the fat was silver skin tissue. Very tough to chew, so I spent a lot of time trying to cut it out of my bites. This left a healthy portion of uneaten steak on my plate as it was difficult to remove the silver skin effectively. All of that said, the steak had a great flavor.

My date had the Blue Crab & Meyer Lemon Filet. Basically Flo's Filet with a blue crab mixture on top served on a bed of grilled asparagus.  I thought the steak was pretty good here as well, but I wasn't a big fan of the blue crab on top. I felt that the seafood taste overwhelmed the flavor of the steak. I'm okay with surf n turf, but I guess I prefer to eat them in separate bites.

If you are looking for the flavor of a high-end steak house, you won't find it here. Although it was very good when you are considering what you pay, it just isn't as good as some of the big names like Capital Grille, Flemming's, Ruth's Chris, or Morton's to name a few. If you are deciding between LongHorn and a Black Angus, Outback, or Texas Roadhouse type of restaurant, I would definitely pick LongHorn.

As a side note, a few years ago Ruth's Chris started a more affordable menu with a 3-4 course meal for $35-$45 per person. I don't know if they are still doing this, but if so, there is no reason to go to a lower-end steakhouse if price was your concern."}
{"text":"Service wasn't so great any of the times I've been here but this trip deserves a review.. 

The waitress kind of forgot I was sitting here or something like that because I'm still sitting here, with time to post this review and read all the other reviews left about this place. 

I could understand if the place was jammed packed but as I look around, I'm the only person seated in this section. Welp, fellow yelpers, I wouldn't recommend this place to a single soul. Unfortunately, I'm too kind-hearted to leave without leaving a tip. 

Here's my tip:  you've came to work to work, so actually do some work while you're at work\""}
{"text":"It's a decent place. Along the lines of Applebee's and TGI Friday's. Steaks are good, but not the best in the world"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!! Appetizers, cold, soggy and greasy!! We ordered the wild west shrimp, they were cold, FULL of deep friend grease, soggy as if they had been sitting in grease for 2 days. The fried pickles-nasty! Soggy, and greasy!! Yuck! Ordered, the 12 oz sirloin for $19.99-Not worth it!! Only about 1/2 in thickness. They let the meat rest on our plate, so ALL of juices were ALL over the plate which made the fries soggy. My son ordered the bacon cheeseburger. They forgot the bacon! Wait staff slow, didn't clear the appetizer plates away until we were paying our bill. Take head to these Yelp reviews, this place sucks, and it really needs to close!!! Subpar food at ridiculous prices!!"}
{"text":"Crappy service and food. 

We came with a group of 7 and it took 1 hour to get our dinner. Slow drinks and slow service with sub par food. 

Stay away"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants and service was phenomenal!!! We got engaged today and decided to go out to eat a good steak. The food here is always amazing but we had never received such amazing service anywhere else like we had today here at Longhorn. The manager here tonight was Michael Parker. He took the time to come over to our table to help take some plates out of the way but ask us if we had anything special going on and after we told him we had just gotten engaged he talked to us for a bit longer to get to know us and let us choose a free dessert and on top of that provided us with a card from Longhorn that everyone signed for us. It was such a pleasure going out and eating here tonight. The restaurant here at this location always provided us with good service regardless but today really deserved a great review from us :) we I'll definitely continue eating out here."}
{"text":"Our friends got us a gift card to Longhorn and we've been putting off stopping at one.  We were in the Robinson area and thought it'd be a nice treat; steaks and fixin's not too difficult right?  Right, but very average for the price.
We waited for about 20 minutes, but our waitress was prompt and nice.  She kept the my iced tea refills coming and was cordial, again just a bit above average though.  We got small steaks which were cooked the way we wanted them, but their flavor wasn't anything special, again just average.  
In the end Longhorn is just another chain restaurant that will never wow the likes of me.  It's okay enough, but in my opinion definitely not worth their prices. 

Cook a steak at home and grab a bottle or two of cab sav."}
{"text":"Pros: Food was delicious, and I had enough to take home (reheated well for leftovers). We had the lobster/shrimp/cheese dip appetizer (ooey, gooey, cheesy deliciousness). I had salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. He had ribs and salad.

Cons: 1) The wait was extremely long (we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night), but when it was finally our turn to be seated, they tried to put us at a huge, round table for 6-8 when we were only 2 people on date night. No thanks! I saw a booth open and asked if we could be seated there instead. It took them about 15 minutes to wipe it down and seat us. 2) Our waitress didn't know what she was doing. She didn't give us water, she forgot to bring us our beer and wine, and basically forgot about us once she had dropped off our food.... it took us a while to get the check, which was unpleasant after waiting so long to be seated in the first place.

Overall, the food was nice, but I'm not sure it's worth returning due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with extended family and it was great. Had mussel appetizer which was fantastic and our server, Destiny, was super! My salad with steak was delish and we had an overall great outing."}
{"text":"I suppose it's better than the Red Lobster across the street.

I went in on a Tuesday evening for dinner. Since I was solo I sat at the bar, and the bartender was attentive and helpful. They carry Tito's vodka, but were out of it this night. Their specials included lamb chops and maple glazed carrots, so I ordered both. They were out of the carrots, and my second choice was the baked squash.

The squash was decent. Unfortunately, the medium-rare lamb chops came out cool on the plate. The bartender was busy with tables in the bar area, and I hadn't planned to be there too long so I ate the dinner. When she asked how the meal was, I mentioned that the entree wasn't hot and she apologized and offered to let the manager know. He came over to apologize as well, and took 25% off the bill. I appreciated the gesture, but likely won't go back again."}
{"text":"We live within a couple of miles so tend to eat there abt twice a month. We even have a favorite server we always ask for. 

Not the best of the best steak houses we have ever patronized but always reliable, reasonable prices and for us, close by.  One of our favorites.

No reservations allowed but they will accept \"call ahead seating\" if they have a wait.  Call before you leave home and add your name to the list."}
{"text":"Went to LongHorn for lunch on a Saturday, they were serving two big parties so we understand it was a little bit of a wait. But unfortunately, our food did take about 45 minutes to get to our table. I had the 7-Pepper Sirloin Salad (delicious) and my date had like a steak and bacon sandwich. 

This was my first visit to LongHorn and they do have reasonable prices for the large portions of food you get. I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Love the service here the wait staff is awesome and good so fresh. The bread is awesome and I love the menu as it has a great variety of foods and treats."}
{"text":"In town on vacation and had an amazing experience. Aaron was our server and took great care of us, making sure our food was delivered fast and very personable ! The staff was very attentive to details all on aspects! Enjoyed our service and will be back when in town"}
{"text":"Went in for couple of cocktails with the wife in the early afternoon and really really enjoyed our bartender, Mary. She was very friendly and helpful.  Her friendliness encouraged us to stay for dinner.  Mary was able to secure us a table in a very busy restaurant and we were sat as a family of four by Richard, the manager and attended to by Deja.  Deja was very friendly, had a sense of humor, and performed well in a very busy environment  The hot bread that came out before the meal was awesome and Deja was  quick to take our order for drinks and our meal. I had the beefsteak tomato and bacon salad, my son had the finger enchiladas, my daughter had the kids macaroni and cheese, and my wife had the mango tilapia. All were wonderful.  There  was an error, in my favor, where they added chicken to my salad but they quickly took care of it on the bill when it was brought to their attention.  The staff is extremely professional, friendly, and very good at customer service.  In our experience, they serve as an example as to what good customer service in a restaurant should be. Well done!"}
{"text":"Went out for son's birthday last night.  Restaurant has a smell very dirty vinegar wash rags when you walk in.   Disappointed in service very slow to our table but helpful to another.   The salad is supposed to be a chopped salad (I love their salads) and the lettuce was overlooked in the chopping process.  Hope next visit is better.....have always loved this location and their food."}
{"text":"Wow.  Terrible prime rib sandwich.  The meat looked terrible, and was falling out of the sandwich.  There was hardly any meat; it looked like an 8 yr old made this.  I sent it back and ended up not eating because i was short on time."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. I always get the outlaw rib eye loaded baked potatoes and a cold beer. Food is good. Staff is ok..they could be more welcoming and friendly..."}
{"text":"Eh, I'm going 3 stars, and that's it. Our bill for 2 people was almost $73 before the tip! However, the food was just competent, and for what we paid I feel that it should have been better. 

Long Horn appears to be the weak partner so far in the cowboy steakhouse triumvirate that includes Texas Roadhouse and Lone Star (haven't been to one yet). I mean, again, it was all pretty good. I really couldn't bag on the Lobster Shrimp Dip with its mozzarella/gouda blend. My 7 ounce Flo's Filet was adequately tender but didn't have enough of a  wallop in terms of flavor. The Crab Fondue that came as a side was kind of innovative I guess, coming off as a Crab Au Gratin with bread cubes on a wooden skewer for dipping, but I'm not sure that crab and cheese go well together, unless we're talking about cream cheese of course. The Loaded Baked Potato was as good as they come and had all the usual garnishes. I don't recall much about my salad (we ate here late last week). In trying to reduce my consumption of carbonated beverages, I went with the Long Horn Limeade and found it refreshing albeit a little biting (no it had no booze in it). 

Despite gouging us for everything else, the offer a dandy of a dessert deal called The Longhorn Dessert Sampler. For $8 you get 3 full desserts: Chocolate Stampede, Caramel Apple Goldrush, and Mountain Top Cheesecake. Each one of them alone was fit for sharing, and we barely made it through them all. The Chocolate Stampede is just a chunk of cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The Caramel Apple Goldrush is a cross between an apple crisp and Apples Foster. The Mountain Top Cheesecake is a typical yankee-style cheesecake with strawberry puree. 

How many words are there for capable? 

I'm tired of chains. Yes, many of them are good, excellent even, but hell, I need to get offa this track!

P.S. Our server Abby L. was fun, friendly, very good at her job, and a little nerdy in a cute way."}
{"text":"AMAZINGNESS.  Oh my god, Where do I begin? Steaks were perfect, their special sauce was PERFECTION. The aroma from that briquette container. WOW ! ! !  We also had mac n cheese, baked potato, asparagus, and fried calamari.  Everything was superb.  

Longhorn Steakhouse, surprisingly started off in the East Coast, never had it. Waiting for it to migrate to California . But until then, only vacationing  times while  we're traveling or the times we visit family back in the homeland . . . Washington DC times."}
{"text":"Experience was average. Service was pretty good. Was here with a large group of 10. Reasonably priced happy hour beers until 7pm. Had a 12oz. Ribeye with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad. Ribeye was a perfect Medium rare, outer sear was a bit over seasoned and steak was a little on the thin side. Mashed potatoes tasted like instant, which is my biggest complaint. Salad was good. Had the opportunity to have a leftover burger the next day that my son ordered. It was a very good tasty, sirloin.
Overall, Long Horn reminds me of the defunct Lone Star. Ok joint, but there are better steaks to be had."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with our dinner here! We got the 30$ deal that included an appetizer, 2 salads, and then 2 entrees. The shrimp appetizer we got was HUGE.. Practically a meal. Oh and the bread they give is super delicious. Anyways I had the mushroom steak and it was delicious. And I enjoyed the sweet potato as well! It was a TON of food for the price and it was all good. Super impressed. Plus our waiter was top notch. Overall a great experience here"}
{"text":"Longhorn always has good steaks, prepared the way you asked. No exception this time. Everything was good including the service. First visit to this longhorn, but not the last."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Longhorn Steakhouse ever. First Impression: A Little Bit Unkempt. There was no host at the stand but a nearby waiter did approach me and provide me with menus and a place to sit. I attempted to order an Ultimate Steakhouse Martini with Kettle One. It arrived with No blue cheese stuffed in the Olives as the advertisement states.

 The bartender was the worst experience of the night. Extremely inattentive, uninterested and not warm. I explained I had no blue cheese in the olives and she said \"Well it will be a minute, do you want the waitress to bring it\". I said I would wait for her. Once the bartender returned she dropped the olives in my glass. I then said this martini was a little too strong and could I have more olive Juice. She snidely responded\" The glass will over flow\". I'm not an idiot, I can see that. I then suggested she provide me with a shot glass of olive juice on the side. She brought a cup made for coffee creamer with olive juice instead. I thought she would have offered to re shake or remake the martini, discard the old olives, and at least APOLOGIZE  for not having the drink correct initially, something- I GOT NONE OF THAT.

I ordered the Prime Rib (6oz) & Rock Shrimp. I substituted asparagus for the salad that typically comes with it. After eating three or four asparagus I noticed a medium length STRAND OF HAIR wrapped in with the asparagus. I was immediately disgusted. I notified the waitress.

A woman came over about three minutes later and apologized. I assume she was the General Manager. She was very nice and apologetic. She compensated my meal but left the mushrooms and onions on as well as my Martini. Once the waitress returned with my bill she announced \"She forgot to take off the Mushrooms and Onions\" and then left again presumably to get another bill generated. When she returned it was only a bill for the Martini.

I am utterly surprised they did not compensate my entire meal. Especially after seeing a HAIR STRAND  in someone's vegetables and receiving a drink that was incorrect. Worst of all this was my very first time at a Longhorn Steakhouse- and first impressions are EVERYTHING.

GIVING TWO STARS BECAUSE THROUGH IT ALL THE STEAK WAS GOOD LOL, BUT IT ISNT A CLEAN LOCATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXTREMELY LACKS."}
{"text":"This is mine and my finances favorite date night place! The prices are great, the food is good and the drinks are yummy too. I read a lot about people \"not liking\" their steaks seasoned so much, I guarantee you that's a Sun City goer who tried those steaks. If you want nursing home food go to Mimi's Cafe or something. The steak here are juicy, flavored and affordable. The service was quick and never had an empty glass. You can easily have an appetizer, two meals, and some drinks for under $65!"}
{"text":"I had seriously exceptional service at the Long Horn in Madison. The managers Sara and Chris both stopped by to make sure that we were having a pleasant visit. My steak was cooked amazing. I ordered the parmesean crusted filet and it was seriously so tender it cut like butter. I would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Longhorn. I'm generally never found in a chain restaurant. 

The booths were comfortable the drinks never ran dry and the food come out very quickly. The steak and lobster baked potato I ordered was out of this world. The fresh bread they provide was also delicious! 

YUM!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today.  Greeted & seated promptly.  The service was very attentive, quick to take drink orders & ready for the food order when we were.  I had a burger...with bacon & the 7 pepper spice.  Our waiter offered to bring bread to the table while we waited for the food.   The burger arrived quickly & was very good.  Nice spice with a little kick.  The fries were also good and plentiful!   The only 'complaint' was I ordered it medium & there wasn't a hint of pink inside of it, but there are worse things in the world.  Definitely will be back to try some other options."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, thank you Ashley our server!!
Shout out to outback down the street come over here management and let long horn give you tips in service, food preparation. Great welcoming environment would definitely recommend and come back!!"}
{"text":"Walk in the door and Boom!!! Nice little hostess with a smile greets and seats me and advises who my waitress will be.  
Wait for it...Boom!!! Another friendly smile from the waitress herself. She is very nice and professional and takes my drink order. I ask about lunch combos being an adult entree... They are!! Free app for me via email coupon, she looks at the code via my phone and holla!!!! Spinach dip is great.  Not to keen on the chips (i like plain tortillas myself) but the dip itself is great, nice thick texture and flavorful.  
The atmosphere is laid back and decor is cool. Definitely one of the nicer interiors I've seen from a chain steak joint.  
Braised beef and shrimp/lobster come and is say its decent. Nothing over the top for my taste buds but the bacon/cheese covered chips (and crackers) that come w/the soup are a delight. The right kind of crunch in my soup-like it. This particular meal gets 4/5 for flavor as the BBQ sauce leaves a little to be desired. 
Overall, a nice little lunch outing.  I want a dessert but I just can muster myself to do it, shame on me!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Ma and I were trying to figure out where to have lunch, and she suggested LongHorn.  I never really thought of them as a \"lunch place\", but hey - she was buying. :)

Their lunch menu is really nice - but the three lunch combo levels of $7, $8 and $9 is really convenient.  At $7, you get soup and salad.  $8 gets you a little more, like a burger.  At $9, you can go for a half prime rib sandwich (next time, prime, next time...)   I went for the $8 burger and opted for the french onion soup for my included side. 

Our waitress brought out some warm bread and butter for our wait.  Very nice!  It worked well with the soup, too.  The soup was excellent.  It was not some frozen stuff they just slop out for you - it was pretty authentic with a nice cheese baked on top.  I ordered the burger medium-rare and was betting it would be just medium.  Nope - nice and pink inside.  Great!  The toppings were fresh and tasty.  The burger wasn't the best I ever had, but it was pretty good.  Mom had the same thing and she was thrilled about what a lunch gem LongHorn turned out to be.  We'll be back!

The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly enough - can't complain."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a three because of the ambiance. Other than that, it's the epitome of blah. Our bread wasn't hot, the salad was mediocre, and the wings were ho-hum. My wife didn't enjoy her shrimp salad (and the shrimp didn't sit well with her). My son's burger was okay but the cheese wasn't melted. The fruit cup was good. Our waitress was in a pissy mood right off the bat, which definitely didn't set the right tone. 

If I return to LongHorn, it will be with a friend for a couple of beers at the bar. I will no longer dine here due to a very underwhelming experience, which led to a poor value."}
{"text":"The previous persons that mentioned Dino is the man here were correct. Get the salad dressing on the side. Got a steak which most if not all was under cooked but I like rare steak so no worries but part of it after diving in I asked to be fired up on the grill and it came back still a bit rare but super grilled on the outside which was awesome! I thought the Mac and cheese would be dried out but it was really great and that's saying something cause I'm picky. Overall I was most impressed by everything cept the steak which is what they are known for. A little over seasoned and under cooked but hey I like salt. Over all I would say only eat at the bar and it's not as bad as reviewed."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had low expectations going in and I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants. The meal was good, but average. Nothing spectacular, but not bad and definitely what I think I would expect. For the price, you can get a much better meal at other places. Our server was nice and helpful ,though, in making suggestions. The food itself was slightly bland. Will not be going back. Again, not because it's bad but just so average! Three stars."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Longhorn in ages, but I'm glad we decided to stop in for lunch today!  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, and our food was just right.  We'll definitely be returning here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Good steak options and even the beer craft is not that bad. Servers are very attentive and helpful. This restaurant chain needs to bump up their decorations, is the same old pictures that I've seen in another locations years ago."}
{"text":"Sat right away, the server aka the bartender took care of my order and did follow up with me after bringing the meal. The presentation of the meal left much to be desired and the steak was about average nothing fancy, not the worst steak just average. 
The plating was rather boring with meat and a side, no additional garnishing to appeal to the senses just nothing of interest."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale each year from Mass. Needed a steakhouse that we new the product to be dependable. Was not disappointed. A great bang for the buck especially if ur not familiar with other area steakhouses and don't want to chance on a sub-par steak. Excellent choice."}
{"text":"An average steak for an average price. Nothing I ordered really stood out at all, even the service was mediocre. I would compare this to a Sizzler or a Lone star. You would be much much better off eating at the Texas Roadhouse just east of here on the 60 & Mesa drive."}
{"text":"My daughter took me out to Longhorn Steakhouse for fathers day.
The wait was about 30 minutes as we did not do call ahead seating.
Once we where seated the waitress came right over took a drink order and then brought bread and our drinks.
I started with a french onion soup then a salad and then finally a sirloin with mashed potatoes.
The onion soup was just ok nothing special
the sale was good and fresh
The mashed potatoes tasted more like a mix then real mashed potatoes and ate only a few bites as they where terrible
Th sirloin was cooked just right and tasted fine.
The service was excellent and the waitress was great.
I would have to say I probably would not go back as Outback is much better all around"}
{"text":"Sick of trying to get food here. Every time I go the workers seem they don't feel like working. Foods great... too bad the workers ruin the experience."}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place. I got the ribeye, cooked medium well and it was cooked perfectly. It came with a loaded baked potato and a house salad. We were also served a honey wheat loaf that was warm when it arrived at our table and was delicioso. I highly recommend Longhorns if you haven't already tried it."}
{"text":"I love Longhorns.  The service is excellent and the food is top notch.  This was a special occasion dinner for me.  My girlfriend came over before we got here and was able to arrange for us to get a great seat and was able to decorate our table. I was completely surprised thanks to managements help.  I had an 11 oz ribeye that was cooked to perfection. It was so tender I could have used a butter knife to cut it.  I'm trull a fan of Longhorns and highly recommend anyone who hasn't tried them before, do."}
{"text":"Love this you want a good steak you can't go wrong here, and they have great drinks for those who don't drink alcohol"}
{"text":"Came to eat a healthy lunch. Salmon here is really good. Service is great, too as the wait staff is attentive and friendly. Fries are ok."}
{"text":"Stopped  for a weekday lunch. We had a coupon for a free appetizer, so we got their Wild West shrimp appetizer, which must have originated in the Great Salt Lake area, as it was the second saltiest item that has ever crossed my lips, losing only to eggs cooked by a fellow Boy Scout who mis-read instructions which read \"1 cup milk and salt to taste\", which, Greg,  didn't mean a cup of EACH!
I LOVE salt and I found myself using lemon wedges to try to rinse some of the salt away.
Quicker to the draw than I, my wife laid down her fork early on, and while our waiter offered to have another app prepared, we declined as we weren't paying for it anyway, and felt a redo would be skating a bit on the cheap.
Should you order it, however I determined via the waiter that a \"light dusting\" of salt is added after the shrimp are cooked, so don't trust your luck, tell 'em to hold the salt altogether, shakers are at the table. 
Determining that the shrimp on their entree salads are presented with tail-on,  and not caring to tangle with them whilst attempting to retain any sense of decorum, she got a steak Caesar salad, and I got their Bleu Ridge Sirloin Salad.
She enjoyed hers, I was too full of shrimp and salt and far too thirsty to touch mine, I just asked for it to be bagged up to take home.
The waiter was most pleasant and accommodating and personable."}
{"text":"Brought my friend here for a birthday dinner. The parking lot looked pretty full, but it wasn't very busy inside, so I guess the cars were for the neighboring Texas Roadhouse or Black Angus. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. To drink, I got the white peach sangria. Everything tasted great! The chicken was juicy and the sangria was yummy (and big). Our waitress was attentive, almost too attentive, but that's always preferred to the alternative. For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake. Normally I don't like the mushiness of chocolate lava cake, but I don't know if they overcooked this one because I actually liked it. It was not a cheap meal, but nice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Have had good experiences at Longhorn in the past, though tonight wasn't my favorite. The bread & butter was good as always, but my burger was on the dry side. My mashed potatoes were good but my friend's mashed potatoes were cold. I tried a little chicken which was very moist but a bit too lemony for my taste. So while it wasn't what I would consider a bad meal, it wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Entertaining some friends and thought we'd culminate the weekend with a trip to LongHorn for some steak!

Location & Aesthetics -- located on West Bell Road between Pei Wei and Carrabba's  restaurants.  Not difficult to miss from West Bell Road and even from the backside of the restaurant.  
Lots of available parking and the exterior was well maintained and clean.
Interior -- very spacious and adorned with decorations of the West/Southwest -- saddles, spurs, cowboys, Texas longhorn, etc.  
Noise level was average.  Waiting area was very spacious too and seemed it could accommodate quite a few families.  Thankfully one is allowed to order from the bar whilst waiting to be seated.

Service -- could be a little hit and miss here.  As we were seated, we were greeted by our server in a reasonable time and provided with menus.  
Drink orders were taken.  Before drinks were brought to the table, another waitress shows up with complimentary bread and butter with a knife though no plates and she seemed somewhat confused as if she had the wrong table.  Immediately after, the initial waitress appears with the drinks and the plates (-1).
I couldn't help but notice that after our meal, we were asked if we wanted more complimentary bread.  Shouldn't this have been assessed by staff prior to our large meal?

Menu -- very easy to comprehend and our waitress returned in a reasonable time to take orders and answer questions.

Food -- despite ordering the 24 oz. Porterhouse, the food didn't take too long and came within a reasonable time.  Thankfully we had the drinks, friends, entertaining conversation, and the complimentary bread to pass the time.
Complimentary bread with butter was warm enough to melt the butter, delicious, and complimented our aperitifs.
Our meals came with a salad and dressing which arrived well before the entrées and it appeared fresh enough.
The food was delicious -- ordered the asparagus and the medium-to-well Porterhouse (24 oz).  The asparagus was crunchy, sautéed well, deep verdant green, and it wasn't limp.  The Porterhouse was tender, juicy, cooked to perfection, and contained their signature seasoning.  My only gripe was that if you're going to serve me with such a large piece of meat, it should be served on a plate that's sturdy enough to hold it.  When cutting into it, the plate was sliding all over the table!  (-1)

Overall, happy with the food despite the service being a little hit and miss.  Do recommend if you have a hankering for some steak, and myself, will return!"}
{"text":"I've been dining here off and on for the last eight years. I find their steaks (rib eye is my choice) to be juicy and tender. If I was to compare this to Outback, I would choose Longhorn every time. I have only had steaks ( uh...this IS a steakhouse...right??) and cannot comment on other meals offered. Their salads are good and their chili is a bit too thick. Overall...a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I've always liked Longhorn, but I believe this to be a cut above! I had the ribeye steak and loaded potato...just scrumptious!  Surely the place to go with a staff that makes this place a nugget of pure gold."}
{"text":"Service: the woman that escorted us to our table, Veronica or Vanessa, looked at us like she waved to kills us for coming in. Not friendly. Our server on the other hand was helpful, kind and patient. I don't remember his name but he had gauges in his ear and spoke softly. Wonderful waiter!

Inside: it's a chain steakhouse so kids running around with parents that don't mind. Decor is quite nice tho. 


Food: Parmesan crusted chicken was very good. My sirloin had to much fat. The salmon tasted like the ocean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to give this place another try. Let me start off by saying our waitress Glenda just started here. She very friendly and good with people. Very attentive our drinks were never empty. She checked on our table the prefect amount of times not to little not to less. I did not like my soup and she changed it out at no charge. Then our steaks came out. My boyfriend got the parmesan crusted steak and thought it was okeay.  I got the jalapenos steak and ordered it medium however when it came out it was well done. Glenda got me a new steak and the manager tony comped my meal.
People should learn from tony he has the best customer service. I have seen and experienced myself"}
{"text":"Our Porterhouse for two was supposed to be cooked medium. It came out so rare that it was uneatable. The staff offered to bring another one, but we had already waited so long for it to come out that we decided against getting another and to grab a quick bite somewhere else. The manager did take it off of our bill, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"Longhorn is probably my favorite steakhouse. I have been to some very high-end steakhouse's in numerous states, And their filet mignon does not even compare to Longhorns. The salad here is one of my favorite I love the chilled bowl as well as the chilled lettuce.  !! The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because -all of the Longhorns we have been  to are very noisy and loud. Too many hard services with the sound bouncing off of everything. This causes the dining experience to just under par."}
{"text":"I gave two stars because the food was tasty.

However, this was our third try with longhorn and we officially will not be back. 

Our first trip, we came in forty minutes before closing time. To be courteous, we asked the hostess if it was still ok to be seated and if they still had time to serve us (seemed an easy question since they didn't close for forty minutes). The hostess stared at us a moment then said \"I don't know\".  Long pause... So we left.

Second try, we were seated fine, but it was like they forgot about us. We finally got service and food, but the servers seemed too interested in each others' lives to do a good job for their patrons.

The other night, we were seated, waited over ten minutes for a server to even take drink orders. Waited over five for our drinks... Our wait for the appetizer and bread which came out together was about twenty minutes, and the salads and entrees followed almost immediately after. Our server mostly ignored us except for dropping off our food. The service was mostly schizo, and was the final straw for us.

We gave you folks a fair shake. You aren't worth the money."}
{"text":"ok I eat here a lot, love steak, this was the first time I had to do it ,return a steak, they were prompt , no questions, Mike manager was great, Mary  was great, new steak was great,will be back very soon. thank you longhorn steakhouse.  Dave j"}
{"text":"Start with the cheddar bacon dip.  Don't think about it, just do it.  You'll thank me later.

This place is really pretty good.  Their appys are tasty, and not too expensive, and the lunch menu is very reasonable.  I had a steak sandwich, which was fantastic, and my wife had mussels.  All around good.

The only downside I would give them is they tend to over-season their steaks for my tastes.  They're good steaks, the seasoning is good as well, just too much of it for me.

The remedy for us, was simply to ask for only one side of the steak seasoned or light seasoning, that seemed to do the trick for us.

I will go back."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is pricey for the food you receive. The best item I have had is the shrimp appetizer. When I questioned the waitress about ordering a rare burger, she replied with \"ewe no\". Nothing like insulting the customer. I like to give all restaurants a few attempts to gain my business, but after three bad dining experiences, I will cut my losses. This restaurant has the worst service."}
{"text":"So I would like to give an update on my earlier post I have been contacted by guest relations I have also been contacted by the new manager of this facility and I will be going by to give them a second chance. Thank you for your quick attention to my experience."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome great food great service great time thank you Mario for the exceptional service"}
{"text":"Being in the customer service industry I was extremely disappointed with the service and food quality. First the service was very poor and it seemed that none of the staff knew what was going on with our order. They forgot to bring out half the order and then got it wrong. I asked for a medium and got rare. Had to wait till my meal was almost done before I got my first refill. Bottom line this place had all the potential to deliver but just fell short. Sorry but I will not be back"}
{"text":"Our group came in on a Saturday night and did not have to wait. We got the artichoke dip and smoked gouda green beans for starters. The dip was decent but I was not a fan of the green beans. I also ordered the 6oz sirloin and parmesan chicken which comes with two sides (I got broccoli and a side salad) for $18. The rest of the meal tasted so good and we had plenty of leftovers to take home. Our server Nicolle was excellent. She was polite, quick, and very helpful. She made it an amazing experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was very good, and the service was great. Went on a weeknight, so there wasn't much of a wait to get a table. The prices were similar to other chain restaurants in the area. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Or of 3 steak House right next to each other... (Texas roundhouse, Longhorn, and Black Angus) This is the one to go to. Besides the steaks that everyone likes, the mashed potatoes with everything on it are to die for. I was so hungry I forgot to take a pic. Definitely work 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon which was literally raw in the middle. They took it back to fix and it came back cooked but extremely hot all the way through and extremely dry, so they obviously microwaved it. My husband's steak was obviously cooked with the salmon since it tasted fishy. And what was supposed to be a medium steak still oozed blood. Not a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner. Tried a couple of the appetizers and had a steak and potato. Everything was ok. Nothing really stood out and I would probably only go back if someone else was picking up the tab. Waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I have to tell you, I started with this chain in Georgia, the food was awesome then, the wait staff way different than the one I now call my Home Restaurant. When you walk into this one, you know the managers take care of the people who work in the Restaurant. They greet you like you are family and are always friendly. The food is not always the way you ordered it, but the floor managers make sure it gets cooked the way you like it promptly. When they are busy, its crazy, but when you get a chance to sit down and socialize with your waiter or waitress, it becomes very intimate and appealing. Lauren is our favorite waitress for Lunch. She is very friendly, knowledgeable and offers a constant happy attitude about everything. We've had a few good guys for our waiters but the one waitress who sticks out for dinner is Kristen. She is very soft spoken, does a great job with your meal and is prompt with drink refills. The best part of this Restaurant is Jennifer, she is the manager and while you'd think managers miss the weekends to be home with their loved ones, Jennifer is not one of those managers. She makes Longhorn on Bell the best place to go for food. She has a ready smile, is very knowledgeable about up in coming menu changes, shares great stories with you and welcomes comments about her wait staff. We love this restaurant, simply because none of the other restaurants welcomes you like a family. We're here to stay. Try the carrots, ask them to cook them twice, you'll be in heaven! Oh and the green Tomatoes from this past summer's menu, were to die for, wish there were more of them! Down home cooking, steaks just right, atmosphere to die for - yep, Longhorn on bell!!"}
{"text":"Been there twice and haven't been overly impressed - but the kids like it.  First time i went the steak was WAY to peppery.  Had a chicken dish the next time and the  first bite was full of fat.  Wife had a chicken/strawberry salad and the bottom of the bowl was  swimming in dressing.   Service was very slow the second time....wasn't crowded and still waited 30 mins for food once ordered.  Waitress second time was very 'bleh'.  First time I went the waitress was far better

Kids (teenagers) said the burger was good and the filet was good (tasted both...and they were right)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love steak. We have never had a bad piece of beef at this LongHorn. We have tried different cuts from the prime rib(best medium rare), renegade, flo's cut and the porterhouse. All have been very good, tender and cook to our liking(medium rare).  I enjoy he ceasar salad, good flavor with grated parmesan slices and romaine lettuce. The baked sweet potatoes are (in my opinion) way better than outback. The flavor is better there is less strings inside and they cook to a much softer consistency. When we want a good meal we go here :)"}
{"text":"Soup was cold
Bread was cold and wet
Meat nonexistent 
Bland and u inspired 
I keep forgetting how mediocre this food is."}
{"text":"In the limited time I have been in the Charlotte area, I have discovered Longhorn Steakhouse in Concord, NC and it delivers. My wife is a picky steak connoisseur and I am a grill chef of modest repute. She liked her Rib Eye and I thoroughly enjoyed the Porterhouse with the signature steak sauce. 
The staff made timely visits, kept the water full and the cocktails coming, and projected a professional yet human attitude that felt comfortable.
Have gone back and enjoyed the meals and staff each time. Took a good friend visiting from the west, and he commented on the professional staff and quality food.
Best franchise steak house so far!
One suggestion, do not get rid of the signature steak sauce. It is marvelous!"}
{"text":"Tonight was not a good experience for me. My pork chops were dry, my corn fritters were undercooked, and my broccoli was unseasoned.  I usually like Longhorn, so maybe it is this location or a bad nite. Either way I won't return to this location or Longhorn for awhile."}
{"text":"Didn't' catch on that seasoned steaks were their thing.  Suzanne's steak cam with a thick crust of seasonings that were was predominantly pepper.   Wondered what we missed in the menu so went to see one at the hostess desk.  Soon the manager was at the table; asked if this was normal, yes was the answer that we have 'seasoned steaks'   I like pepper but it was more than I would eat..    We won't be back.  Party of 4 was $100"}
{"text":"Great service! First timer, I got a steak and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had! Our Server was very helpful in suggesting things and very attentive. When I come back to Arizona, I will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain the fantastic time the hubby and I have each time we go to Longhorn in Mesa.  We always stop to have a drink at the bar and the bartender, Mary, is nothing but pure awesome.  She has yet make a drink for us that we wonder if there is any alcohol in it, as we think of many local places.  This last time ,we were seated in Heather's section and immediately service began with our appetizers and refresh of our drinks.  Heather explains everything on the menu and not one item was wrong with our order.  I would recommend over and over and over again being seated with Heather and of course, stop by to see Mary at the bar!  Thank you Longhorn for superb staffing!!!!"}
{"text":"When one goes to Longhorn, you pretty much know what you're getting. Decent food and service. While the food was ok, the service wasn't very good this time
Iced tea was warm and syrupy. 
The bread was served without plates so we held our bread and ate over the table.
Our salads came out before the appetizer and when they finally brought out the appetizer, again, served without plates. 
The server never came back and offer more drinks but stopped awkwardly to comment that he liked the appetizer we ordered except for the mushrooms. 
Anyway, I highly doubt we will return here."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 20 and had excellent service!! All 20 of us were very happy with our food! Not one of us had anything negative to say. Very clean."}
{"text":"Nicole L. . . . . . . . . Where do i even begin??????

So the only reason I went to Longhorns was because of your amazing review. It was my best friends birthday so i thought, might as well take him to an amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steak dinner.

Pretty easy to find as its right on Alma School, which is literally right down the street from my place in Dobson Ranch. Parking lot was pretty empty so it was a good sign that there was no wait and we would be able to get attentive service, or it was a bad sign of things to come. However, I like to stay positive.

We walk in and there isnt a hostess to be found. Its pretty dead, maybe 3 - 4 tables occupied that was scattered thru out the resturant. While waiting to get seated, i'm getting my hopes up because of your review and how legendary im hoping this meal will be. You gotta understand that this was my first real steak resturant that i have been to after my 4 month journey in Southeast Asia where they usually dont eat steak. So again, we were only there based on your hyped up 5 star yelp review. After a few min, we get seated by an actual server rather than a hostess.

There were 3 of us, we were all very extremely nopah. Since we were there for steaks and for a birthday celebration, the decision was made for the biggest rib eyes for everyone. So we all went with the Outlaw Ribeye, Medium for the lady and Medium Rare for the men. (From their menu: Outlaw Ribeye - We called it this because it would be a crime if you didn't try it! It is one of our favorites because of the combination of juicy marbling and fire-grilled, bone-in flavor. 18 oz. $22.49)

After ordering, we get the infamous Longhorn bread. I am a huge bread and butter fan and can destroy a few loaves all to myself. However the bread was hard and seemed stale so we barely touched it.

We finally received our entrees and were ready to eat. Having perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks in mind, this was a huge disappointment. Mine was cooked to medium, my GF was cooked to medium well, and the birthday boys was cooked to medium rare. The medium rare steak was juicy but not tender, the medium steak wasnt juicy or tender, but the medium well steak wasnt so juicy but it was tender.

All in all it was a huge disappointment. Service wasnt the greatest, but it was pretty average. Food quality was below average. Value isnt there. Total bill after tip and tax was about $92. We would have been better off going to Texas Roadhouse on Stapley.

Maybe i just came on an off night, but corporate places like this should have a level of consistency, but to me it was just a waste of $92."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner alone while staying at a nearby hotel. Keeping in mind that I sat at the bar (so the service is always faster than the dining area), I had a really good experience.

I started with a Yuengling on tap during happy hour. The bartender was very attentive, but it also wasn't hard to be as there were never more than five people sitting at the bar during my time there. I ordered a ribeye medium with asparagus and a side salad; the total for these three items was about $25. The ribeye was done perfectly medium and had the right amount of seasoning. The asparagus was good, but a little overdone and squishy. The salad was  excellent as I upgraded to the bacon blue cheese seasonal option. The big pieces of romaine were very fresh. I ordered a tiny piece of banana cream pie to go - it was as expected.

This is a good option given the other choices in the area. I think they are just hitting their stride as this is a new development that is still under construction. I think in time it will be a go-to spot for professional dinners and groups."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 10 for a birthday, the place wasn't too busy and there were plenty of empty tables. 
They informed us that they didn't have a table big enough to accommodate us(which is expected) but when we asked if we could pull a couple tables together the manager informed us that it's not allowed. So we ended up sitting 4 to a table with the tables about three feet apart. 
It just blew my mind that we couldn't simply push the tables together because it's not like we were going to be blocking a path or exit or anything."}
{"text":"Amazing experience and food at this new location. Food was excellent!!! This steakhouse sits between two other steakhouses, but I don't think the other two will be there long."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. Nice casual atmosphere in the bar. Although very full house, perfect for talking. My friend had the mojito's and said they were delicious and super inexpensive at $5. When she ordered a third one, the server whined that it was difficult to make because it had many ingredients. I was sort of stunned by the comment. Clearly she was happier about my drink order, tequila in a glass with a lime ...  the wings were tasty and the shrimp was OK."}
{"text":"My Sister and her husband took my here to celebrate the big double nickel. My first time eating at a Longhorn Steakhouse and I have to say I was quite impressed!
Started out with a Montana Mule, their version of a Kentucky Mule. Jim Beam bourbon, ginger beer and lime served ice cold in a stainless steel mug. Very good, cold and refreshing.
My steak was the 11 oz Renegade sirloin medium rare, that was seasoned and cooked spot on! Side was a loaded baked potato that was on the smallish side but I didn't care 'cause I was to busy with that steak.
Our server even though it was packed that night, was very friendly and attentive. Bringing us anything we asked for quickly including extra bread and butter. We it came time to leave, take out boxes arrived no sooner than we asked for them.
I would have no problem eating at another Longhorn as long as the food and service was as good as we had here.
Thanks to my sister for making my birthday a great night out!"}
{"text":"We have been to this Longhorn Steakhouse in Matthews in the past and have had excellent service and food.  On Labor Day, 4 of us visited this restaurant and had the worse service in our restaurant history with Longhorn.   We were seated with 2 menus and the hostess had to return with 2 more menus, even though she seated 4 of us.  After that, our server appeared to take our drink order of 3 waters and 1 coffee, which took 15 minutes to deliver.  When the server delivered the coffee with a creamer that was curdled, our guest had to stand up and go find the manager to get a good creamer for her coffee.  We ordered as soon as we received our drinks, and had specific requirements for our salads and our dinners.  Our salad was to be delivered first, and that took 20 minutes after our server took our order, and one of the salads was not correct.  The server returned with the correct salad after I asked him to please hurry because all of us wanted to eat our salads at the same time.   After we were through with our salads, the server did not return back to our table to ask if we were satisfied with our salads; in fact, he did not return for about 20 more minutes.  We were wondering if our entrees were going to be correct when they finally arrived about a half hour later.  3 of our dinners was good, but my husbands order was overdone, but he was really hungry by this time and did not return the meal back to the kitchen, but just ate the over cooked steak.  The server never returned to ask us if our meal was tasty, but he did return after our meal to ask us to stack the empty dishes for him so he could take them to the kitchen.  This act, along with the other issues, was the last straw.  We again asked for the manager and she came over to listen to our story and adjusted our bill somewhat.  
The Longhorn Steakhouse needs to make sure that their servers are trained properly in the future.  We will not be returning back to this Longhorn location for a very long time."}
{"text":"I was surprised how much I liked the restaurant.  Food was good, service wonderful and good set up for a large group.  We were easily 23 people in attendance.

I had the Flavorful Under 500 entree and it was very good - the steak was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with Daughter, so place was empty so decided to sit in bar area and very happy we did.  The restaurant is a rustic theme type.

Food; we Lunch portion ribeye, with mashed potatoes, vegetable of day, mac cheese and salad; the portion size was perfect for us. The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked to order; the sides were good especially the Mac and Cheese.

Service; James was working the bartender area and was amazing, very outgoing and helpful."}
{"text":"On Sunday my wife and I were very much anticipating having a nice prime rib dinner at longhorns. It was a nice day and being there was no football we went out to use the gift card we had received at Christmas. When we arrived we had to wait 15-20 minutes but we knew it would be worth it. Their prime rib is awesome and we knew it would be worth the wait. We were finally seated and our server arrived about 5 minutes after that so we have been there roughly a half an hour. We were given menus and when the server returned and we were placing our order she informed us they were out of prime rib,,,this is Sunday at 6PM at a steakhouse, or so I thought. We asked to see the manager and she was polite but didn't even try to have us stay. I still cant believe that they ran out of prime rib at dinner time on a Sunday. We are just going to use the cranberry location and hope they don't run out."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the wait was about an hour.  We had to stand for a few minutes before a space even opened up at the bar, but it's a popular place on a Saturday night, so we weren't surprised or too put off by that.  The bartender was very friendly and prompt.    Normally we wouldn't have eaten there because of the prices, but we had a gift certificate and I signed up for the email club, so we got a free appetizer.  The appetizer was the calamari and red peppers, it was excellent and served so fast and hot we had to wait for it to cool down.  The waitress was friendly and got refills regularly for the drinks and bread. Our meal was the Porterhouse for 2 - served exactly as ordered and their steak sauce made right at the table was very tasty.  I would eat there again if I had a GC or good coupon, otherwise, it would have been just a bit expensive for our taste.  Everything was yummy, but not so outstanding as to be a regular place."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic when they originally first opened, but the quality and service has declined ever since. I put my finger right into the middle of the French Onion soup and it was cold but still had melted cheese on top. The kids sirloin has shrunk in size over the years as well. Even my child noticed the difference. Very disappointing. I would have said something to our server, but she was never around...never filled up our drinks, didn't even ask if we wanted boxes. Poor service, below average food."}
{"text":"We dined here on a Sunday night.  There was a significant number of patrons, but we were seated without delay. 

Our server was Sharon.  She did a great job.  

We ordered a rib eye steak, chopped steak, steakhouse burger and a fillet mignon.  The food was outstanding.  

I've now eaten in at least 8-10 Longhorns and I've never had anything but a great meal. I can't wait to return for another great experience."}
{"text":"Our server was impeccable!!  The food was delectable!!  The drinks were divine!!  My husband commented that it's rare you go to a restaurant where they get everything right!"}
{"text":"So the rating would be higher IF the 2 assclowns I talked to were a little nicer. 

So today is NYE, I called last night for call ahead seating for tonight. The female I spoke to said I'd have to call today then hung up on me! So I called today, the male I spoke to said I'd have to call back closer to the \"call ahead\" seating time I wanted then he too just hung up on me! I called back a few hours later & didn't give the same male the opportunity to not take my reservation. 

So my parents & I sat down at our table, and our server Tracy was amazing! She laughed & teased with my family. She was polite, she was truthful about 2 items I was debating about. She herself deserves a 5 star rating! Tracy was great! Thank her again please!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for the best steak in town. Always very tender and juicy. The favor is the kind that NO added flavoring is needed!! My mouth is watering already!!!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend with my wife. Wanted a good steak and stopped at Longhorn. Great Ribeye steak cooked exactly as ordered. Very good service. I really liked the call ahead to put your name on the wait list.
I will stop here again when in the area."}
{"text":"7/4/2016 Visiting from California, stopped in with family, GREAT food and GREAT service but a little pricey."}
{"text":"A lot of people I know would never be caught dead at a LongHorn, especially in the suburbs. I don't get that. LongHorn is freaking delicious! Unfortunately, it's not a place I get to go very often.

Luckily, my friend is pregnant, and she and her fetus were craving LongHorn today. Lunch was the perfect time to go - no wait for a table, and then I had the whole day to digest and work off my meal.

We shared the breaded shrimp appetizer, which is crazy good, as is the warm bread they serve before your meal. I definitely recommend the brie and dried cherry salad as well. 

I do think it's overpriced for what it is... My lunch was over $20, and I didn't even order a steak. But, all in all, I thought it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I have to say we go here all the time and after last nights experience I don't know if we will ever go back!!!  My family and I went here for my mother's birthday and waited over an hour for a table. After we finally got our seat we ordered appetizers and our meals right away. After an hour and we still had not received our salads you can say we were all a little upset. Even other customers commented on the fact that they were sat and already finished and we still had nothing. The manager tried to accommodate us but the damage was already done. We didn't receive any compensation for the wait or the fact that they ruined my Mother's birthday dinner. I'm so very disappointed!!! My family works in the restaurant business and if we ever treated people like this we would no longer have a job. Such a bad experience!!!!"}
{"text":"First time, likely last time.

Only reason I am giving 3 stars is:
1. Good service
2. Cold beer
3. Fresh bread.

My \"shaved steak \" & bacon melt sandwich was not worthy of even a star.  First sandwich that came out was cold with shoe leather beef strips.  Sent it back and got a second one, which was hot, but still shoe leather beef.  Could barely bite through it.  Figure a steak place could get this right, but a huge fail on their part."}
{"text":"I usually wind up here at happy hour because the price is right, the food is good, and the bartenders are friendly and fast.

The spicy chicken bites and shrimp & avocado stack on the happy hour menu are delicious and highly recommended.  The steaks I've had there have been cooked perfectly, and the baked potato could probably have fed three people.  

Bonus feature is that the bar area isn't too loud to have a normal conversation, so it's a great place to meet people for a drink after work."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual steakhouse with delicious food look no further than Longhorn! The food is a great value and tasty, too! Don't miss out on the parmesan or blue cheese crusted steak topper, its only $1 extra! So tasty I would pay $3 if I had to, it really makes for a superb steak!"}
{"text":"Very happy with this location. A bit quiet on our last visit - with the exception of the huge family headed by clueless parents who allowed their kids to destroy a corner booth.

Service very friendly, prompt and on point.

Try the porterhouse for two. Excellent value for the price. Cooked to perfection. Very good quality meat."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

My brother in law and his friend helped me unload my U Haul truck.....had to take care of them somehow and we decided to come here for dinner.  I was pretty impressed!

We were seated in a comfortable booth, placed our order for drinks and then were served some of their honey wheat bread (really good) and with butter.  I decided to go with the \"Outlaw Ribeye\" for my meal.  This came with salad and a side. I chose their chopped salad and fries for my side.   My brother in laws friend got the same thing and my brother in law went with an 11 ounce sirloin.  My brother in law also decided to get a \"Wild West Shrimp\" appetizer for us to share.  Here is how everything tasted................

Wild West Shrimp-  This was great!  It was popcorn shrimp with chopped up peppers served with a dipping sauce.  The shrimp were fried perfectly, the peppers added a little kick and the ranch dipping sauce was great too!  The serving size was pretty large too.  It fed all 3 of us and was a great choice by my brother in law.

Wedge Salad-  Pretty decent sized salad.  Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, blue cheese, bacon.  It was tasty!

Outlaw Ribeye-  This thing was a nice sized steak.  18 ounces, I believe.  It was cooked perfect the way I ordered it (medium).  Juicy, fatty (in a good way), and seasoned well.  It was a great steak!

French Fries-  These were the only things I was not totally impressed with.  Standard fries with seasoned salt.  They were just ok.

Total after tip and everything was $130.00.  Not bad for 3 full sized meals, an appetizer and a few Jack and Cokes.  Service was awesome and overall it was a great meal.  I will definitely take my wife here once she moves out.  This dinner was excellent!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit, the food is delicious. The only thing that makes me uncomfortable are the cowboys and Indians all over the walls, I think it's inappropriate!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. One week ago my dad placed an order to go for he and my mom using a gift card we gave him for Fathers day. They both ordered prime rib end cuts. She orders a sweet potato and salad and he ordered asparagus. When he got home all that was there was the meat and a loaf of bread. No side orders. How can this happen? Did he forget a bag? Rina took the order. My dad called and let James the manager know and he said he would send a voucher through email. When I spoke to my mom today (Monday) and she told me this story I was furious. She had not received anything via email at the time. So I called to speak to a manager. I got James. He said yes he had spoken to my dad and that it would take a few days for it to arrive since it had to go through corporate. The reason I'm writing this is that James while trying to be helpful was also condescending. I specifically called at a slow time so I wouldn't be calling during a rush. Answers to questions were okee dokee. Flippant. It was as if this was not important to him and he didn't care. I don't think this is how you want your restaurant to come across. It's been a week. Nothing yet. My mom says it doesn't matter if they send anything or not. She's not going back."}
{"text":"First of all let me say we decided to go to this place at the last minute and I expected to have a wait, however we get there at 7pm and the two girls upfront told us 30 minutes, so we decided to wait 45 minutes later I check on how long and she said oh 30 more mins we had a big party just show up. I didn't know if I was missing something when I questioned the wait vs the party that just walked in since they didn't have a reservation all she could say was we will page you when your table is ready. Worst service and we didn't even make it 4 steps into the place. Word to the wise save your money and go elsewhere with better service."}
{"text":"Carryout.  Always great food.  Salmon excellent.  Service great even when busy.  Great dinning experience."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night.  Dale was an awesome server.

Food was spot on and the service was top notch.

Sorry Taylor was busy as usual.  We missed seeing her. 

But,,, we will be back. 



We Had a great dinner last night. Lamb chops were absolutely delicious.  The mini key lime cup was a great finish to a wonderful evening.


Kirk is always our server. He is the best!!! 

See you soon.  
Restaurant was packed as usual."}
{"text":"Everything about this place surprised me, in the best possible way. The atmosphere was unique but classy, although some might find it a bit overdone and distracting, I thought it was perfect. The refurbished wood table tops were even a delight that both my wife and I pointed out. The food was exactly what I was hoping for, great quality you'd expect at a steakhouse. The server was a perfect blend of friendly, helpful, and non-intrusive, a rare find in my experience. He knew the menu and made great suggestions. The prices also surprised me, they had very affordable and tasty budget dishes and the $26-$35 steaks that you love to splurge on ever once in a while. I think this is a hidden gem, and I'll be going back sooner rather than later. With another visit as enjoyable as the first this will soon be a 5 star spot in no time."}
{"text":"We had dinner here July 1.  Our meals were well prepared, We had the Cowboy rib steak and the filet, both were prepared perfectly.  Good, friendly and attentive server.  Good quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I normally do not review chain restaurants, but we had such a good dinner on Wednesday night that I just had to drop in some love!

I am surprised at how many times I visit a steak house and am disappointed with how my steak is cooked. That certainly wasn't the case at Longhorn Westgate!

We were seated right away and greeted by our server Martha. We were hungry, so an order went in right away and just a few minutes later, food appeared on our table. We started with the Sweet chili Calamari. Wowwwww. The chili sauce was so good, my fiancée kept the leftover to put on his meal. The calamari were crisp on the outside, tender seafood on the inside. It was a good portion. As always, the bread was fresh and delicious.

The salads are great too. It's a nice mix of greens with plenty of toppings. My 8 oz Renegade was honestly the most perfect steak I've ever had in a restaurant. I don't like my steaks with much pink, but I went with Medium Well today. It was a good call and this steak was cooked exactly how a Medium Well should be. It had just a bit of pink, was nice and tender, hot throughout and well done enough for me. It wasn't over-seasoned so I could actually taste the quality beef. My baked potato was cooked properly and served with ample butter and sour cream.
He got the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken and broccoli and thought both were delicious. The chicken had a lot of great flavor- lots of melty cheese, crispy panko on top. 

We were both so pleased with our food and service and will definitely make this our go to steak spot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to longhorn. The stars came from the food and definitely not the service. 

We were sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to come and by the time he did we were ready to order. So we put in our drink and food menu at the same time. He came back with two waters and said the drinks were coming from the bar. I was confused to why my coke would be coming from the bar but still waited. Minutes later one alcoholic drink came and I got frustrated (I didn't know by bf ordered a alcoholic drink and now it made sense to why our drinks would come from the bar) because I still didn't have my coke, so I asked the lady who brought the drink for mine and she kindly got me my soda.

The waiter never noticed that I even needed a refill and barely checked on us. When a steak came out (someone else brought it) it was lacking a side, we got frustrated thinking they might have forgotten it but then our waiter brought out the side separate. During our whole $60 meal all we could talk about was the horrible service- and when you're paying that much money I expect superb service.

We also had a young child and were never asked if we wanted a drink menu or her own drink or any acknowledgement that she might want her own food instead of eating from our plates."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, they didn't have the Chef's Signature Dish. I believe at the time it was Osso Buco. Today, it's my birthday and I wanted to come here to celebrate and get a Chef's Signature Dish, the lamb chops, but they didn't have it. They didn't have the other Chef's Signature Dish, mahi mahi. It was just a disappointment - worst feeling on your birthday. I did stay because everyone else didn't have a problem with their order. I was able to try the New Peaks for the appetizers. Our server was kind enough to give me any dessert for my birthday so I was able to try the New Peak on the desert list.
I'm the type of person who likes to try new items and things that are on a limited time. I would suggest calling first to make sure they have the Chef's Signature Dishes. 
I did give a 4 star even though I was very disappointed. I'm trying not to rate according to my feelings completely. The food was good and so was the service. But I still didn't get my lamb chops. =("}
{"text":"It was ok for a steakhouse but very chain like. It was ok but nothing special"}
{"text":"Terrible service.   Waitress disappeared after taking the order.    Manager brought the drinks over.  Salad finally came out and 1 minute later the main course.   My wife and I both had ordered Steak medium it was blood rare.  I had to find someone to complain too.   I sent both back to redo and specified make sure the side items are warm.   Came back out still not right and sides stone cold.   Manager took one steak off the bill I should have just walked.    Never again."}
{"text":"LongHorn has always been so underrated to me! I have loved coming here over the years, and I expect I'll return for many more! I love all of the chicken dishes they have to order along with the salads. I really enjoy having family and friend time here, as they love it as well! I only with there was a LongHorn closer to me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend around 130pm, there were about 4 other people there at tables. We were immediately seated, when our waitress came over she didn't even acknowledge my presence at the table and only addressed my (male) friend which at first I was like whatever but as the meal went on it continued. His drinks were refilled and mine were not lol we waited roughly an hour for our steaks. I ordered mine well done, it was medium well at best. He ordered his medium well and was medium at best. We ate what we could but left the overly pink areas because we aren't the type to complain. Not my greatest concern. I guess my biggest thing was just how I was treated, as if I wasn't even seated at the table, by the waitress. It was really weird. When I would try to speak my order or drink or ask for a refill she wouldn't even look at me, just kept asking him if he needed anything else."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say after many good experiences with Longhorn, this location did nothing but disappoint. Firstly, the service. The service was very subpar for what you would expect at a moderately priced steakhouse. I never once got a refill, even when I asked. She got my order wrong not once, but twice. She also took her sweet time, disappearing for long stents of time, then returning to the register to stand around and talk. I can understand sub par service if you're busy, but my fiancé and I were one of maybe 6 other families or couples in the place. Next to the food. The food was just mediocre. My potato came out very soggy, the steak very much over cooked. I ordered a medium rare, and there was little pink when I cut into it. I ordered the potato plain and it came out sopped in butter and sugar. Lastly, when she took our check, the waitress yet again disappeared. 10 minutes later she returned and pointed out the gratuity amounts and said \"Hope you enjoy the rest of your night.\" Never once have I been told the tip amounts at a restaurant. I shouldn't have left her a tip, but I did. I wouldn't recommend eating here, and I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"Father's Day, a pretty busy day in the restaurant world. Longhorn's was busy. We called ahead to check on the wait time. We were told it was 40 - 60 minutes. But, she would put our name down if we wanted. Nice. So, we put our name on the list and waited for 25 minutes before leaving. We arrived, were handed our pager and only had to wait an additional 15 minutes or so, pretty much right on the 40 minutes we were told. Kudos for that system. I wish other restaurants would take note of that. When people call, put their name down on the wait list.
Now, the review. There were 4 of us dining. My silverware had not been washed, there was dried food crusted on the fork and knife. Yuk. Everybody else got clean silverware. Our waiter was hustling, but he just couldn't get it ALL dialed in. The bread took a long time to make it to our table, and that's only after we asked a few times for it. The first item we ordered was the Sweet Chili Calamari appetizer. It was cooked very nicely. We asked for the Sweet Chili sauce on the side, which it was.
Next on our order were the salads. Our table ordered 2 salads D.O.S. (dressing on the side) but only 1 came out correctly. A new salad was brought out fairly quickly. The salads were nice, nothing special.
For our main courses, our table ordered the Flat Iron Steak, Primetime Burger, Longhorn Gourmet Burger and the kids Sirloin steak. The Flat Iron steak was cooked correctly and tasted fine as did both burgers. The kids sirloin was cooked o.k., it was just a fairly wimpy portion.
All in all, it was o.k. Nothing special but nothing to keep us from coming back some day. I would also like to add that it was quite loud inside, a bit more like a cafeteria sound level then what I expected inside Longhorn's."}
{"text":"Gross! I have been here before and loved but this Saturday was disgusting. Started with filthy table. Glasses were dirty. Stuff floating in water glass. Bread plates were dirty and you could see greasy fingerprints. Canceled our order and left."}
{"text":"To start off we were a party of four with two checks.   We were seated at Table 46 at 19:36 12/31/16 and Anthony F was our waiter.  Our meal consisted of one 8oz Filet & Crab Cake and one 6oz Filet/Lobster with a total of $63.21. 

When we arrived we were told that it was going to be a hour wait.  Being supper time and New Years Eve we fully understood that and had no problem waiting our turn.  As we noticed after we checked in their were three \"empty tables\" directly behind the hostess table and remained empty for better part of 15 minutes.  I ask about the empty tables and was told they are waiting for servers rotation. (whatever that means).  To me, it's taking money away from your business as allowing customers waiting longer than they should.  

At any rate, about a hour wait we were taken to our table and given menus and small plates.  Anthony F. arrived and was very friendly and took our drink order.  After Anthony returned with our drinks he took our dinner order.  All four of us had a salad, we waited sometime for the salads to arrive but they finally made it to our table.  However, one big problem remained \"we had no silverware\" which to eat our salad with.  We waited and waited and waited, finally I had to flag down another server and ask if she could please bring some silverware.  By that time we were able to eat all our croutons on the salad.  Now that the salad was consumed we waited and waited for the main course to arrive.  Finally our friends meals arrived but mine and my wife meal did not.  Again we waited and waited and waited, then Anthony came by and said something like \"oh, only two meals arrived\", he then left and a little bit later our main courses arrived.  My steak was a little cold as was the lobster.  

My wife and had have had a bad year from a medical standpoint and have been unable to work for the last year.  With our medical issues behind us, we decided to take a night off and drive up from Casa Grande, AZ to your restaurant and enjoy a nice hot meal.  Needless to say we could not have been more disappointed plus I had to pay $63.21.  We wanted to enjoy a nice meal to bring in the new year.  In looking back I should have gone to Sam's Club and purchased some great looking steaks and put them on the smoker and had my friends over all could have been done on what we spent on one meal."}
{"text":"Why would you get rid of your happy hour. What kind of establishments decides the best business move is to eliminate a happy hour.  If your looking to stop and get a few appetizers and drink with friends don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"The food was terrific--the salad was tasty, the steak was great, the bread was good. The service was very disappointing....we were ignored for 5-10 min at a time, with lots of communication errors. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Had the Redrock Grilled Shrimp for lunch.  A little more than what I wanted, but nothing seemed interesting that day.  Everything was good.
The high point was the waiter.  The best waiter I've ever had by far."}
{"text":"Date night here also. Went for the \"2 for\" dinner. It was awesome! Hot bread.  Calamari and red pepper were awesome! Sirloin steak cooked to perfection. My wife fell in love with the Parmesan crusted chicken. Service A++++. The Caesar was lacking croutons - probably my only gripe. But that didn't take away from the dinner at all,"}
{"text":"While in town had a craving for a great steak but wasn't up to spending 5 $$$. After searching my around me app and using reviews from yelp. Longhorn was the choice. Called ahead asked how long wait time was girl said 10-15 min asked if I'd like a reservation so I gave her my info.

Arrived at the restaurant parking easy and well lit. hostess  super friendly waited only about 5 min for the table. Menu had great options all your typical steak house items great part it didn't look like I was gonna break the bank. Our party was 3 and bill was $75 

I had a rib eye med rare with steak house mac and cheese with ceasar salad. Salad was great but, I'm a fan of salads lol. So the food arrives as soon as the hostess sets the plate down she asks how's does everything look. I cut into my steak, to check the center and was borderline pink and brown, but definitely not a warm red center how I like it. So I expressed my concern the waitress was empathetic and apologized. Said, go ahead get started with that and i'll bring another right away. With in a very reasonable time she brought another steak and asked for me to cut into and take a look. Bazinga it looked perfect and let me tell you amazeballs was my description was perfectly cooked, great taste, nice texture, tender and the Mac and cheese was on point.

Definitely a fan of Longhorn will be back for sure way better than outback or those others ."}
{"text":"Eating a medium rare steak with a hot white American woman. What more can you ask for,
You know what I'm saying? Ok let's take a second a review the place. It's a Sunday lunch rush and they gotten our food out so freaking quick, like the flash quick not quicksilver quick. I asked for an egg to be put on my steak but apparently They don't anymore. They would have gotten a five star if they did. Ok bye here's my steak"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after another restaurant had a 45 min wait on a Friday night and had a very nice time.  There were a few hiccups, which are to be expected at this type of establishment, but over all we were very impressed.

The boy ordered a T-Bone and I ordered their Great American Steak Dinner, which is their feature special.  When the steaks came out, my MR was more MW and I waited for our server to come back.  One of the other servers noticed I wasn't eating my steak and came over to check on us, which was a nice touch.  While I waited on my refire, I had some of the Boy's T-Bone and was blown away.  The steak was tender and had amazing flavor and was one of the better steaks I have had in a long time.

Even with the missteps, we were very happy with the service and with our food.  Will definitely be back the next time we need a steak fix!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I've only ever been to Texas road house and didn't like it so I never went to a steak house again until now. We get gift cards from family and this was one of the places it was good for so I figured give it a try and I'm glad I did! 

I wish I would've know it was a higher scale place because I most likely would not have brought my five year old, however you can bring children they do have a kids menu and they get teddy grams with there menu which I thought was cute! The food runner also brought him some more later on without us asking and I thought that was very nice! This place had more of a date night feel as opposed to like an Applebee's so I probably wouldn't bring him again. 

We got:

Calamari - it was tossed in a sweet chili sauce, and a slightly spicy dipping sauce. Very good! I loved that it was tossed in the sauce as opposed to a drizzle, and no tentacles, yay. Would recommend! 

Mixed green salad - came with my dish, the strawberry vinaigrette was amazing!! Loved that they put diced cucumbers in it! 

Mashed potato side - very good!! Nice and buttery 
  
Salmon - Sadly disappointing. Not bad just very plain and a little over cooked so it was dry. 

Steak bacon burger - Awesome! I loved that the meat was similar to a philly cheese steak, slices of meat, as opposed to a patty. I would get it again. The fries also had a lot of flavor, really good seasoning. 

Half rack of ribs - The sauce was a little too tangy for my liking but the person who ordered them liked them. The meat was good. 

Moscow mule - standard, great flavor, not very strong alcohol wise 

Overall I really enjoyed the experience and would go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time. The service is awesome we normally request Kirk. Kirk is always very friendly, accommodating and provides quick service. Everything we have tried here has been delicious. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. Definitely must try the black and blue Margarita, the statehouse Mac and the fillet."}
{"text":"We wanted steak so we got steak. Had the porterhouse for 2. I believe it was 30oz. Steak was cooked medium which looked like medium well, should of ordered medium rare. Mashed potatoes and asparagus where good. However the coffee was horrible. Do not order coffee it's definitely instant coffee however they didn't even charge me for the coffee so that's nice."}
{"text":"Greeted warmly as we walked in. For a Friday night after 7pm, we were shocked to be seated immediately!

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Although she did not know if an e-coupon we had would work. 

We ordered an appetizer (firecracker chicken wraps) with our meal because things seemed to be moving ever so slowly! The appetizer was rather tasty but things went downhill from that point.

It took FOREVER for our food to arrive and the restaurant was rather empty, particularly in our section.  When it did, our younger son's kid's meal was the best looking plate! I specifically asked for a medium well burger to have a warm pink center. It was charred and very well done. Our older son's burger from the kid's menu looked the same. Perhaps most disappointing was that my husband ordered a steak with a baked sweet potato as his side. The steak arrived without it; he had to eat french fries with a steak. The server seemed offended when my husband said \"nevermind\" to a sweet potato that would arrive midway through his meal. In fact, her demeanor completely changed and she didn't open her mouth when she dropped off the check.  We still tipped her as the quality of food was not her fault but we did expect her to remain courteous. 

Not done with Longhorn but scratching this location from our list."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is consistently terrible. Been here three times since it opened and always disappointed. Hostess staff is subpar and servers aren't attentive."}
{"text":"Surprised to see some negative reviews, have been going here periodically for quite a few years.  Just had a delicious dinner with Mom, steaks were perfect.  I like that they have Mixed Veggies now as a side, they were delicious - the little bits of broccoli were perfectly cooked too (not hard as a rock like most places).  But what really left an impression...well, two things.  1.  The manager checked on our table, as he was doing with most of the other tables - fantastic customer service.  2.  The croutons in the Caesar Salad were utterly delicious, had a slight hint of lemon (not garlicky like croutons at most places), which I think is a great idea.  Just makes the meal even more interesting and delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went to Longhorn for dinner last weekend and it was a good experience. The ambiance was great and so were the servers, they were courteous & polite. We ordered a portion of their  breaded shrimp from the shareable appetizer section and a portion of the 12 oz prime rib. The appetizer was just average, slightly on the saltier side. However their prime rib was awesome! It was juicy, tender & had all the right flavors! Will definitely go back there for steaks!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for ribs so this was his choice. Our server was Makeda (I hope I spelled it right) and she was awesome. Everything was delicious and just right."}
{"text":"First & last time i will ever go there! Heather was a horrible waitress. I dont even know why i even left a tip! Her tip should have been LEARN HOW TO BE NICE!!!"}
{"text":"I do not go here often and the last time I was here, besides this recent visit, was about 3 - 4 years ago.  Although their very friendly staff and great service has not changed, their menu did get a facelift.

On this visit I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast with Strawberry Pecan Salad and a Baked Sweet Potato.  I LOVED IT!  The chicken was nice and juicy and the potato was cooked through.  The salad was very fresh and crispy!

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Quiet night, not a lot of patrons but it took them a while to even notice me. I walked in, no greeter present. Walked over to bar, no bartender present. Hmm should I go someplace else? I thought, since I'm already here, I might as well stay. Plus it's on the corporate card. So I stayed. Bartender finally shows up and takes my order. Didn't offer me a drink until I was about to pay my bill. Wow, there goes your tip. But in the end, I couldn't do it and since it's not my money, I still ended up leaving a 15% gratuity."}
{"text":"Went on July 25 for my birthday. Had planned to go to Cheesecake Factory but was hungry for a good steak and we decided to try it.

Friday night, of course we expected it to be busy. Wait time was about fifteen minutes and not too bad. But from the moment we stepped inside, felt this was a somewhat disorganized, chaotic atmosphere. Almost every employee we encountered seemed lost and inexperienced.  They had to sweep and wipe down the table while we kind of stood there  hovering over our neighboring diners. I think I could have accepted that if the food had been good. It wasn't.
We ordered a coke and strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was very good.
We were asked if we wanted bread and said yes. Received a basket of two slices of cold hard bread and butter. Since we hadn't been there before, didn't know what to expect, maybe they were cutting down on break intake for the health conscience. We ate it, or should I say, tried to chew on it. Later we got another basket of break when I asked for one and this time it was a full small loaf, nice and hot and soft. So I guess we got someone's leftovers before.

We ordered a sampler appetizer which had cheese topped stuffed mushrooms, spicy chicken wraps and tiny shrimp which were supposed to be spicy. The mushrooms were the best of the three. Shrimps were okay...but unless you ate a mouthful of peppers with it, not really what I had in mind. The chicken wraps tasted like frozen chicken wraps you can buy in the grocery store.   

My husband and I both ordered the same entree, ribeye  steak and loaded baked potato and salad. The salad was just okay. Iceberg lettuce, a couple of cucumber slices, one small cherry tomato, and red onion with croutons. 

The steaks came and we had order medium well. A hunk of fat the size of a half dollar took up the center while oozing blood seeped out. This was not medium well, more like medium or medium rare. The potato had butter sour cream and bit of bacon. loaded? No cheese? no chives? 

Husband's steak and potato was the same. 
I had had a wonderful day and did not want to end it with complaining about dinner, so we ate what we could. There was more fat and gristle than meat. I left pieces on the plate and was actually asked if I wanted a box for it! Should have said yes, maybe my dogs would have liked it. 

Did not get dessert.  
My husbands grills wonderful steaks at home for a fraction of the cost we paid. Maybe we should open up a steakhouse!
Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise!  I went in expecting just your typical Texas Roadhouse that is good but nothing over the top special.  Wow!  This place is so much classier and has better food options in my opinion.  The onion loaf that a lot of places have is very greasy, but theirs is not which I appreciate.  Also the steak was cooked to the perfect medium rare which I enjoy, and the side of asparagus was to die for as well.  I think I found my new favorite steakhouse!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we have tried this restaurant. Not only are they slow but they have ALWAYS gotten my order wrong. And when brought to the attention of the management, they seem to get a attitude. You would think at start of the day, one would be more alert and friendly. NOT here. The food is good but they honestly need to work on service quality. This will be the last time that we eat here. What is so hard about making a chicken salad? Geesh!"}
{"text":"First time visiting here and we skipped an appetizer because we heard the bread they give you before your meal was super good! And.. it was warm, fresh and delicious!!! We ordered the new SaltCrusted 6 oz Filet and the 12 oz Prime Rib, both with the chopped salad and loaded baked potato. Let's just say WOW!! Delicious and flavorful! The Filet melted in your mouth and the Prime Rib had so much flavor it was incredible! For dessert we had coffee and the Molten Lava Chocolate Cake to share!! YUM!! We found a new steakhouse that we LOVE!! Service was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"Came here awhile ago with a friend. Thought I would treat her nicely to w good meal in a nice atmosphere. The place looked really clean and nice. The steak that I ordered was well done in both ways. We received great service and had a very enjoyable night here."}
{"text":"Food - pretty good prime rib. Definitely well into medium territory and not the medium rare I ordered and small for 20 oz, but tasty. The chocolate cake dessert was delicious and I usually don't like cake.

Service -  attentive without being annoying. Not cheesy or dressed like a stripper which was a nice plus in such a testosterone-heavy establishment.

Ambiance - heavy Texas theming. In fact, everything is quite heavy so that you can feel like you're pumping iron at your table. Manly! Expect a bit of a cowboy crowd. At least one guest brought his pistol. Noise level is surprisingly reasonable on a Saturday night and we had no trouble having a conversation. 

Value - So-so. You can eat better food for less, but not necessarily steak. The steak here is good, but not amazing. It represents a far superior value to the Capital Grille, but it's nothing I crave either."}
{"text":"Got a gift card. Had a 7 oz filet and salmon combo for 25 bones(no pun intended). Came with a pretty tasty sweet potato drenched in butter and cinnamon. Highlight of the meal. A serviceable salad included. The steak was palatable, but lacked any distinct flavor profile. It tasted like the cow had died of boredom from listening to Alan Cox, and had been cooked over several days by the ambient light of a Kindle displaying boring Cleveland yelp reviews. The salmon was served on a rice pilaf. Both were not great, but better than the steak. All that for 25 bucks is a pretty good bargain. I might try again, but I'm not in any hurry."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at one of these in years and generally avoid them for more local fare. But a $50 gift card changed all that tonight. I was worried because of the negative reviews, especially for the service. But - in a nutshell- we had a really good experience. Our server was prompt, nice, and considerate. The place was a bit busy but not overly loud. We got house salads first with our bread. Nothing crazy but tasty. Bread was good but not as good as others' (like Outback). I got a 8 oz Sirloin and broccoli. The broccoli had a nice, bit spicy sauce to it. The steak was really tasty and perfectly cooked. Wife had salmon and she said it was very good. Last, but not least, my kids got chicken fingers - which came with orange slices and fries. Fries were okay but the tenders were clearly hand-breaded and my kids loved them. Best of all - price was great for how much food we got. Overall - really good experience. Thanks Longhorn!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card and it was Christmas Eve so we figured we'd splurge a little. I've eaten here before so I knew it would be good and I wouldn't be disappointed. 

We ordered the Texas tonion. I ordered the white sangria and the ribeye. The sangria was a pretty good size and it was quite tasty. The ribeye was beyond delicious. I ordered medium and it came out perfect. 

The only negative was our Texas tonion never came out. The waiter wrote it down but completely forgot about it. We did get a free appetizer for next time so that did make up for it."}
{"text":"Was here two weeks ago and had live beetle in salad, ok hard to clean produce, I get that.  Rating is 93.5 so was hesitant to go today but tried and walked out.  Salad was weak, dressing was weird and tasted spurt.  Walked out after waiting a long time for steak to be delivered to our table.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and Prime Rib.  I am picky so I asked for wings to be sent back and cooked crispier.  They are fine the first time I really enjoy extra crispy, i request was met with a smile.  When returned they where perfect for me.  The Prime Rib was cooked to my exact request!  Great meal and Lisa was an awesome waitress!!!  Fair price, good food, very good way staff and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but food was just ok not memorable.  The prices were on the high end.  There were no combination plates such as steak and chicken or steak and ribs."}
{"text":"I tried the Longhorn Steakhouse for the first time recently and had a very uneven experience. Being a steakhouse you would think the steaks would be their strong point, but instead it was their weakness.

First off I will say the service was excellent. Very attentive waiter, the manager came by to check on us (although he did so before we got our food) and the hostess was very nice and accommodating as well.

For an appetizer we had the Wild West Shrimp. It was stellar! Deep fried popcorn shrimp with sliced banana peppers and garlic served with homemade ranch dressing. Definitely the highlight of the meal!

My dinner came with a salad that was nothing special, but definitely not bad. I wasn't there for a side salad though and it was perfectly acceptable.

For dinner I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and asked for it to be cooked medium. It came medium rare, bordering on rare. It was also the second worst cut of filet that I have ever had (the worst coming on a cruise ship). It was chewy and had two big strings of gristle. 

For dessert I had the s'mores brownie which was very good.

So basically, go there for appetizers and dessert and skip the steak.

Oh, but they do make their own steak sauce at your table that was quite good. Too bad the steak sucked."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey. it's really crowded I guess everyone had the same idea early Mother's Day dinner:) food was good steaks seemed a little smaller than I remember from a year ago! I got the filet and grilled shrimp yum! But overall a nice place for steaks!"}
{"text":"Steaks very good. Service a little slow but overall good experience. This was surprising since not overly busy. There was no wait to be seated which is unusual."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Seriously great steak and perfectly cooked. We all just got sirloins, can't even imagine how good their filet must be. Wait staff was terrific and we were seated right way on a busy Saturday night with a party of 6 no less. Only criticism and it is a big one, is the wait time for the food. Took a full 35 min for food to arrive after drinks. The waitress came by our table several times and filled drinks and brought more bread and apologized for wait. Luckily, the food was great, but this needs to improve."}
{"text":"8-19-2017 Stephanie and I stopped in for a early dinner around 430. seated right away, drinks ordered, meals ordered. drinks and salad arrived. salad was excellent, for the entree; I ordered the rib eye & baked sweet potato. Stephanie got the lobster dinner, here lobster was overdone and very rubbery therefore tough to chew. The melted butter must of had a flavor added to it which was in my opinion was horrible even overdone it was way better without the butter. we also asked for more bread which never arrived. The rib eye was very good. I thought the service should have been a little quicker, it wasn't crowded by any means maybe 8 tables. I've been here several times and each time there seems to be something that goes wrong, but this was the best visit even though we sat with empty drinks and no bread when we wanted it."}
{"text":"3.5 star food, 4.5 star service. Everyone was super friendly, and this had the feel of a local favorite rather than an assembly line steak joint. The happy hour appetizer (chips) was solid, though the on tap selection was lacking. The steak and chicken were both good, though I should have gone with the ribeye instead of the filet. The sweet potato was tasty, but the fries were average and the salads were meh.

But you don't go to a steakhouse for salad and fries. You go for meat, and the meat was good. I'd recommend this as a good local place to eat, especially if you don't want to fight Roadhouse crowds. You won't be wowed, but you won't regret your night either."}
{"text":"i was pleasantly surprise with the quality of meat they use. the ribeye was better than flemmings or capital grill. very good steak. we had excellent service, and the place is nice. i will go back"}
{"text":"Ok so we were excited about a new steakhouse near home.
Waitress really tried, but it was an hour before we received horrible turf and surf... rubber like lobster and charred tough and dry baby back ribs
This place has serious back house issues.
Manager comp'd wine and salads
Entrees were inedible.
Huge disappointment.
Recieved gift card for 40
May give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Flo's filet is amazing just wish they had a better beer selection the only thing holding them back from a 5-star rating"}
{"text":"This was my first time at any LongHorn Steakhouse. The place looked packed, but we were quickly seated and only took a couple of minutes for our waiter to greet us. He was very funny, helpful, and knew the menu very well. When our food arrived it was exactly as we ordered it and the steak was delicious!

Our service was excellent as was the food"}
{"text":"Excellent choice tonight. I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye and was not disappointed. Very juicy and tasty, and even the broccoli was fresh and crispy. The bread also was fresh and good. Too bad we don't have Longhorn Steakhouses near us, cause I'd come back. P.S. the 18oz. Steak was only $24.99. Not bad."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Easter Sunday with my parents.  None of us had been before, and wanted to try out a new steakhouse.  It looked nice, and the hostess (who was also the manager) was very friendly and sat us.  The restaurant itself is set up nicely....I don't think the atmosphere is all that cozy, but it's still a nice place.  

The food wasn't very good at all.  I ordered the filet with cheese and bacon.  In the menu, there's a little table that shows and explains the difference between the temperatures (Medium-lightly pink...etc).  I ordered my filet medium rare....like I do at every place.  I told our server that I'd like it more on the rare side than the medium side.  She explained the table to me, which I already understood, but know that restaurants tend to still overcook even with a type of guide.  She said it'll come out medium rare.  It came out medium.....very little pink, if any.  It still tasted fine, but it bothers me when a restaurant focuses on that and can't even get it right.  I know it was the kitchen, and not our server, but it's the fact that she pointed it out to me and it still wasn't right.  

My mom's lamb was completely overcooked as well.  Our server asked when she ordered it if it was ok that they were served medium.  They looked more medium well and one of them was even burned on the outside.  My dad...who loves steak, wasn't all that pleased with his meal either, which is rare for him.

The bread they bring out to the tables, along with the vegetables we ordered as our sides, were the only things that tasted good.  

We needed to try it out, because how else do you know if you like a place.....but we all agreed that we definitely will not be back.  With so many places to choose from, this one is not worth it.  I was hugely disappointed."}
{"text":"Another lunch at Longhorn... perhaps the fifth or so time I've eaten alone at the bar. My previous experiences with the food and service have been what i would call 'average, but acceptable.' I arrived to a greeting from the bartender, who promptly delivered the beverage I ordered. Well, it went downhill after that...

I ordered a salad and corn-on-the-cob.... and I waited... 

Two other customers came in after me, and I overheard them place an order to go. After a while, the server delivered their steak lunches to go while I waited at the bar... 

I was the only patron at the bar ... and I received no words of reassurance from the bartender that my lunch was coming - she did not ask if I wanted another beverage: not another word from her whatsoever.

After nearly 30 minutes of waiting, my lunch was delivered; the bartender did not give me utensils, and I to ask for them. Despite my beverage glass being empty, she did not ask if I wanted another one ... she never returned to ask how my lunch was....

In short, I never saw her again... 

I left $25 cash on the bar for the $23 lunch ... the $2 tip was too much."}
{"text":"First time in a long time. 

I pulled up here with a \"might as well\" type of attitude b/c I haven't been to this restaurant in a while. Pros: their chilli fries and asparagus are good. Cons: nothing else was right. The prime rib, corn on the cob and dessert were all horrible. I know, I know, why would I order prime rib here in the first place.... Idk. Optimism I guess. 

Service was good. 

Will I return: prob not."}
{"text":"On this early evening, my first visit to this location, service by Bo was excellent!  This made for a great early dinner, which was quite tasty as well.  I often opt for the salmon or shrimp.  Today I had the lighter portion of Redrock Grilled Shrimp with rice and my fav, a sweet potato.  Dinner was scrumptious and under 500!  I love Longhorn for these nutritious meals and the great service didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and decor at Longhorn!  It is a great place to eat.  I enjoyed the citrus chicken with sweet potato and the dish was fantastic.  The lunch portion was just enough for me to eat it all.  Following that, I shared a key lime pie - this is the real McCoy!  The pie was deliciously scrumptious - as good as it gets!  I look forward to my next visit to this Longhorn Steakhouse Restaurant."}
{"text":"Great steaks and great service. I've never had a bad meal or experience here. The manager and staff are top notch . I always enjoy dining at this Longhorn and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE not usually impressed with chain restaurants..I was impressed by the staff manager more so than the waiter. The waitress was terrible the management was great...The waitress forgot every request we had ....More water NO, soda refill NO, App NO, Dessert NO....The manager did it all. Should have tipped him instead."}
{"text":"We have tried to frequent this location for our business and family meals to this location.  In fact we spent over $500.00 in the past 6 weeks.  Service was a little hit and miss until tonight.  We just waited several minutes with waiter personal looking at us, making eye contact and doing nothing.  We ended up having to walk out as we could get no service.  So we are at Carrabbas, seated immediately with great service."}
{"text":"Great stakes and salads. Definitely will go again. 
Service was good and prices were convenient. Better to reserve a table in advance specially if you're more than four."}
{"text":"A friend and I got to go to Longhorn's pre-opening lunch before they opened this past Monday (2/24). The overall feel, look, and quality of the restaurant was generally pleasing and we were warmly greeted and seated promptly to our booth. 

Our waiter Tyler was a delight! And informed us on the days selections and gave us great suggestions. We started the food journey with the grilled white cheddar mushrooms. They were rich and garlicky very yummy! Then for our entree  we both selected the ribeye steaks, each was cooked perfectly medium and juicy with the perfect amount of fat.

If you're in need of a good night out ,and don't want to break the bank this longhorn is the way to go. 

And if you are lucky Tyler will be there to make the night or day even better!!"}
{"text":"We came in in the middle of the day and was seating right away. The atmosphere was very relaxing. The volume of the music was perfect. The server was apparently new and somehow order us the bone-in ribeye instead of the 12 oz ribeye. The manager delivered our steaks and explained the situation and asked if we wanted the bone-in at the lower price or if we wanted the steak that we ordered. She was very professional and our server was very apologetic and readily admitted that she had made a mistake. We were very pleased with the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing service and amazing food! Everything was cooked to perfection. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and he also had great recommendations. The manager came over and introduced himself and asked how everything was. I cannot say enough good things about our experience. My husband and I went on a Friday night, we waited for a table for less than 5 minutes and our food arrived fast, fresh and cooked exactly as we ordered it. I had the 12 oz prime, my husband ordered the 16 oz prime. Sides were delicious. Great dining experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"This is the second order for pick up that they left out something things we specifically asked for."}
{"text":"The hostess was the most unfriendly person available no manners at all the bar tenders were super nice but once we sat at our table the waitress seemed bothered that she had to do her job we always had to ask for refills and kept bringing our check and tried taking my wife's plate while she was still eating when it came time to leave my wife went to the restroom the one toilet was full of shit the other had a floating tampon this is a perfect example of the class of people that go here the management needs to step in and do their job I would rather travel to the Robinson location next time to dine then go to this one ever again when I live in South Park"}
{"text":"A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT I HOPED YELP HAD A ZERO BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS MINUS ZERO!

First of all, so many new employees made our visit difficult because they're answers to our questions conflicted each other. We were seated and waited for approximately 13 minutes before the person that seated us had to take our order for drinks because everyone else was busy and keep in mind, the place was about a 1/3 rd full (remember new employees, we know because we asked). After our drinks were finally served our waiter took our order for appetizers because our party was still deciding for our main course. After a total of 30 minutes, we had been served our drinks and appetizers only to find out when they took our final order, they were out of Prime Rib which two in our party had their hearts set on! I then approached the manager and asked, \"How can you be out of Prime Rib, it's only 7 o'clock and it's Saturday\"?! He proceeded to tell me that there is a disclosure on the menu that states \"availability is subject to change\". I said well after waiting 30 minutes where they finally took our order, don't you think we should've been told that when we entered\"? He then said he would look into that, are you kidding me, he didn't give a shit! After 55 minutes upon entering we were served our main course to another disappointment! My wife's $30 dollar Rib Eye was tough, my Rib eye and baked potato was cold! We sent ours back and told them to take it off my bill cause I was so done with all their bullshit! The there Manager needs to pull his head out of his ASS!"}
{"text":"Came here on lunch break with my coworkers and had amazing service from Denyse. She made the experience amazing! Definitely ask for her if you ever have the chance!"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing and so was our waitress Ainsley. We will definitely return for the quality food and service."}
{"text":"we will never go back. the service was bad and the food was worse. if it is going to cost $40 for lunch it should at least be good. the French fries were freezer burnt and overly salty. the prime rib sandwich was very greasy and tough. the burger was cooked rare when we asked for medium. just an all around bad experience."}
{"text":"Never go here on a weekend night ! Over an hour for food . Management didn't even apologized . Horrible !!"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out and I will never go back! It took me 20 minutes to get my food from the time they said it would be done. Charging $20 a plate for some horrible service. I didn't get my sauce I asked on the side nor my drink. I had to go back and ask for it all.. it's sad how people expect to get tipped when they can't even accommodate your order."}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveller to Solon, this is my favorite steakhouse. Sit at the bar or at one of the bar tables and let Dino take care of you. The steaks are superb and are priced lower than other \"high end\" local places. My favorite is the bone-in ribeye! Service is A+, food quality is the same."}
{"text":"The salmon dinner at Longhorn is not anything close to worth $50 for two people. You get a small salmon steak and a plate full of broccoli. It is expensive broccoli."}
{"text":"The service was better than Texas Roadhouse\ the manager did check up on us at the end of service, which was nice. Things I really like: The TEA, the peanuts, people.  Things that could be better: Price and more sides to chose from. 

Most of the time I get the 12oz rib eye baked potato soup, and green beans.  
Chain place that everyone can find something that they like, the food was above average.

Overall, I gave it 4 stars because the menu needs amped up just a bit. But a taste of home is worth the trip! Oh Yeah!!!!"}
{"text":"Used call ahead seating.  Waited in a line of 5 once I got to the restaurant to check in.  And got seated right away.  I recommend the call ahead seating feature.

My guests ordered soda.  I ordered an old fashioned.  It took the server 3 more visits before he delivered the drink.  The second visit we made jokes about how long it was taking.  And he said he was looking into the bar area and it still wasn't up yet.  That's not his fault the bar was slow.

My drink arrived when I got my side salad with french dressing.  Lettuce, onion, cucumber, cheese and croutons.  Pretty standard fare for a chain.  It was ok.

I got the 11 oz Renegade Sirloin steak with steamed veggies and an order of mushrooms on the side.  My steak arrived and was pretty thin.  I had to ask for the mushrooms as they didn't arrive.   A few minutes later those showed up.  Once I tried my steak the first bite was completely gray in color and dry.  The next bite was the same.  So I sent it back.  I rarely send back steak.  But if I'm paying $18.99 for a steak I don't want to eat a gray, dry piece of meat.

I got my steak once my guests were done with dinner.  The nice person who delivered my steak apologized and said they would take care of my steak.  She felt bad my guests were finished when I got my new steak.  My guests got dessert to eat while I ate my dinner.  The restaurant picked up their desserts as well.  

I have 2 problems with my steak.  1.  The steak that first came out looked nothing like the second steak that came out.  I took a picture of the 2nd steak. I wish I had taken a picture of the first for reference and I didn't.  It was less than an inch thick and when the one that came out 2nd was over an inch or so thick.  Why the inconsistency?  2.  I don't mind paying for my meal if you make it right.  I'm not going to argue about paying vs. not paying.  In my opinion, if you make it right and bring me a replacement that is what I order I don't mind paying for it.  You made it right and didn't make me pay.  That doesn't make sense to me.

The second steak was a little chewy.  That's what I expect for a choice grade sirloin.  Was juicy.  And the flavor was what I expected as well for  a choice cut sirloin.  Average.  Nothing special.  This is after all why I came to Long Horn.

Service here was hit or miss.  The misses were the extreme long wait time for a drink from the bar.  The mushrooms were a miss twice.  I had to ask for them when they didn't come to the table.  And by the time my second steak came out my mushrooms were very cold.  So I got to eat cold mushrooms with my steak.

The steamed veggies were crisp tender on my first plate.  Overcooked on the second plate.  Again, inconsistency.

Overall, it was all just ok.  I usually go here when everyone else in my group wants to go here.  I don't see that changing."}
{"text":"I did not like what I ordered or the appetizers but everyone else loved the stake. However, the atmosphere is good and the servers are nice."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service was excellent.  I tipped 26%. It definitely has the corporate chain feel where every aspect of the menu and table items were placed for maximum marketing effect. I liked the server. He was a good guy. 

Anyway, I ordered the bone-in ribeye while my wife had the filet.  The ribeye is supposedly one of the house specialties but frankly it was worse quality than what I would find in a pedestrian grocery store with USDA Choice cuts (which LongHorn features as well).  It was tough and riddled with gristle (not well-marbled like a ribeye should be). It really had qualities of a bad New York cut steak (which is fine too if the cut is good but this ribeye was tough). My wife's filet was decent but not much flavor without the sauce from the shrimp that came with her entree. 

The appetizer (crab cakes) was OK and the sides were fine. I didn't return the steak, I ate what I could and my dogs ate the rest (half). That last part is probably superfluous but it's the truth. Is it my fault for not taking it back?  Well, maybe but I probably shouldn't have been served it in the first place. 

To be honest, we were at the Sears buying garage door openers and my kids were hungry and I said 'what the heck' to try this place.

Since Costco started carrying Prime beef some time ago, we have become spoiled and seldom go out anymore since we can grill and smoke great stuff at home. I just needed to be reminded why I suppose. Obviously, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Longhorne is a chain owned by Darden Restaurants (owners of Olive Garden, Red Lobster, and Capital Grille.  So they have a formula.  However, that means they don't always get the food right.  The steak I've had there is always overcooked.  I have found the burger is really good with a nice brioche bun.  Not a ton of fries on the side, but Americans get too many fries to begin with.  The salads here are overdressed, which makes it soggy.  Service is friendly and efficient though.  This is a good place for lunch but go to Tornado, Delaney's, or Fleming's for a steak dinner in Madison."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every 3 weeks for over a year for work.  Usually great experience.  Today is different.  Female bartender (since I'm working I eat at the bar) was more interested in talking to coworkers and talking to customers with long stories.  I guess I got passed by.   As I'm typing this I have received my nice steak but no bread or offered salt/pepper or A1.    And my drink is low and not offered a refill.  Bad service from her.  Next time I come I'll make sure it the male bartender  who has offered me great service.  I do travel from Indiana to Pittsburgh weekly and bragged on your service but this just changed that.  
At this point I still haven't got anything offered.  
Susan A. was my server. Hope you improve by next visit. John Wine."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, including the appetizers. Beautiful ambience. There is lots of space for parking and I've never had to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This a great location for us which is what draws me to it.  I was however, a little disappointed in the service.  It took quite a while for our server to even acknowledge us, and even longer to be waited on.  I am usually try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but there was only one other person at the bar.

No complaints about the quality of the food!  It was up to standard with what the other expereinces I have had at Long Horns, so I plan on dinning again."}
{"text":"You guys, I have always liked this place. It has never been the best, but it has always been good. We could always count on a good meal and good service at a decent price. But now, now, we won't be back. 

We were trying to grab a quick bite before parent teacher conferences at the kiddos school nearby. We have been to this place more than a dozen times and we have always been in and out in an hour to an hour and half. So, we figured this would be a great place to stop and grab dinner in the meantime. 

We waited for 50 minutes and we still didn't have our meal. We watched while our server and the manager sat and chatted with other customer's (one table in particular) and never bothered to check on us. We finally flagged down another server and asked them for a check because we had to go. Seriously, we aren't trying to be a$$holes, but we gotta go. Let me pay you for your trouble, but I am leaving. That takes another 10 minutes to get squared away, but okay. 

We paid our check and we were walking out to our cars hungry because we hadn't eaten dinner when the manager (I am assuming) chases us out to our cars with bags of food in her hands and says, \"Here! Take your food with you!\" Ummmm.... But we can't. We aren't going to let steaks and chicken strips sit in the hot car for an hour while we are in a parent/teacher conference. Miss Sassypants manager says, \"Well, you could have told your server that you had an appointment.\" REALLY? So, it's my fault that you can't serve dinner in a reasonable amount of time? So, it is my fault that I didn't get checked on for ages? So, it's my fault that you guys were sitting on the other side of the restaurant chatting at a booth with another couple? No, actually Miss Sassypants manager, none of those things are my fault. I am the customer. I am paying you for a service that you and your staff are not providing me. And I even paid you for a dinner that you didn't provide me.

I get it. We all have an off night. My husband and I are both leaders in our company that is dedicated to providing an excellent customer experience so we completely understand how these things work. But, you, you clearly do not understand. You are going to put it on me? It is my fault that you are having a bad night? No. That is unacceptable. Plain and simple. Unacceptable. I will never spend another cent in this establishment that is that rude to a customer. And, unless you feel like being blamed for poor service then I recommend that you don't either."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening and had a very enjoyable experience. The hostess was attentive and the bartender(Lindsay) was so much fun that we decided to eat..and drink at the bar.
My companion had the jumbo fried shrimp and I had the Outlaw Ribeye. This was the best steak I have had in many years in Phx. The shrimp could have been \"more\" jumbo but were very good.
Overall very enjoyable and a good value for the $.
we will go back soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst steakhouse I have ever eaten at. I had the grilled salmon with the steamed broccoli and my friend had the steak. The broccoli was so salty that I could not even eat it. The steak was also salty. The salmon was dry. Overall I could not even eat my meal. This was first and last visit to his restaurant. If you want steak you would be better off going to Outback."}
{"text":"The service is always so slow. I have been to this location numerous times as my grandmother lives in Monroe yet, the service never seems to improve."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at Longhorn and I was quite surprised about how tender the steaks are for a run of the mill chain. A shame that my steak came drenched in sauce though. 

The chicken was just as tender - filet tender and service here is equally good. They also top the mashed potatoes with clarified butter, Yum.

The downfall was that they served us extra cold chips and they were an appetizer, not complimentary. The food was also oversalted; Seasoned and then sprinked with extra salt.

Overall decent food with moderate prices. I'll know what to ask for next time now."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner. The food was good, and so was the service. All these steakhouses feel kinda the same to me. The food and decor are all similar, and I am always full before my meal arrives. After the bread, appetizer, and salad there's really no room left, so I have leftovers the next day. That's not a bad thing, but it seriously takes me several days to recover. Why am I eating/ordering all that food before my meal and doing this to myself? A lot of it has to do with the portion sizes. I am paying for it, and I hate wasting things. I would rather the portion sizes were smaller and the prices came down. Either way...I get my money's worth!

Bread comes free with butter...not cinnamon butter which tastes way better, so that would be nice. For an appetizer, we ordered the bacon cheddar dip with chips. It looked like someone's liposuction with bacon on top, but it was very good! I ordered the bone-in ribeye with wedge salad and mashed potatoes as my sides. Both were good. The salad was an entire plate with bacon and blue cheese on top, even though I just wanted ranch. My arteries hurt... The steak was delicious as well. Overall, great food and experience!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend treated me to dinner the other night, we were both in the mood for steak and wanted to try something new so we decided on longhorn steakhouse and I'm so glad we did! I got the 6 ounce outlaw ribeye with a chopped salad and mashed potatoes, and he got the 11 ounce with steamed broccoli and seasoned fries and everything was delicious!! They were pretty busy but we were still seated quickly and had excellent fast service. We'll definitely be back soon, there were so many good looking choices on the menu I definitely need to try more."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner...we ordered the porterhouse for two and while it might be a bit pricey it was totally worth the money.

The drinks were a little expensive and the wait was long, even though we called ahead and added our names to the list.

Our server was very good and we noticed the entire staff moves at a fat pace.

In all, a very good experience!"}
{"text":"I went to a Yelp event here last night.  I haven't been to a Longhorn in years.  I tend to stay away from chain restaurants.  This was a different kind of experience. The service was top notch.  Our servers name was Kirsten? she was very knowledgable and made a great recommendation for my wine.  The manager, Ed, was very helpful and eager to please, making sure everything was perfect.  He went above and beyond for us.  We started out with a few apps buttermilk shrimp served w ranch, sweet corn fritters, and spicy chicken bites.  All of them were nice for snacking on before our entrees arrived.  I ordered the 18oz bone in ribeye and It was delicious!  They served the steaks with table side steak sauce and a chili sauce you can add to spice it up.  So good!  After we were finished with our entrees the desserts started pouring out of the kitchen. Each plate beautifully presented and let me tell you the portions were huge!  They served a pumpkin spice lava cake, pecan pie, and chocolate stampede!  All were delicious.  My favorite was the pecan pie. Yum!  Thank goodness I came hungry!  I will definitely return to this Longhorn when I'm on the prowl for some meat eatin."}
{"text":"We quite often eat at this restaurant. However last weekend was the first time we ordered for carryout. I ordered Outlaw Rib-eye medium, my wife filet/lobster tail medium. My steak was perfect moist and juicy just like at the restaurant. Hers however was well done. Over the experience was not as nice as in the restaurant, but acceptable.

The Texas T-onion was still good a bit soggy due to moisture from box from the drive home, but still acceptable to eat. 

If you can eat in restaurant is probably better than taking home."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place because he loves steak. I complained about their way too hot and spicy fries on Facebook and they responded and told me to request them plain, haven't had an issue since! Be warned, the fries are HOT, HOT, HOT. Like lips on fire hot and spicy. Get them without \"prairie dust\" if you don't like the heat. My standard meal here is chicken fingers and fries. But, the last two times we went I got the Four Cheese Pasta with grilled chicken and loved it! I love the bread they serve, but just wish they'd completely cut it through, I know, first world problems, but we always make a hack job mess of ours! This is sort of a fancier place than we usually go to so it makes for a great date night!"}
{"text":"First of all the salmon and Flo's Filet were yummy and tender. Service great, no reservation, waited 20 minutes. Nice salad with meal, can't wait to go back.  You have to ask for ketchup. I don't usually order steak when I go out because they are best at home with mesquite wood in my Weber. But these were a nice surprise."}
{"text":"The food is consistently very good and plentiful and it is reasonably priced.  Staff is courteous and efficient and they make a great martini!  We go there often and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Longhorn is my favorite low end steakhouse because their steaks do not taste low end! This location seems to serve smaller portions than other longhorns I've visited. Even the steaks. I'm wondering if it's because of the location, im not sure. But I've never had an issue with my food here. The service is always really good and quick. I recommend getting the parmesan topping on your steak if you want to mix it up a little every now and then. It is sooooo good! Definitely give this location a try."}
{"text":"Ordered Wild West shrimp (huge portion!) and stuffed mushrooms! Both were good. Steaks are well seasoned and tender, didn't need A1 or ketchup like I usually have on the side. Our waitress was super friendly and did an excellent job! Overall everything was great except the lobster tail, it was undercooked and had to be taken back. Only downfall!"}
{"text":"Amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks! I went here with a party of five to try out this new location. I didn't think this place would be that great and thought it would be comparable to like black angus or outback and let me tell you how wrong I was!  I'm pretty picky when it comes to steak, I don't like sawing off pieces of meat and I order my steaks medium rare and they never come out that way or it's just bleeding everywhere and still raw. we ordered the lobster stuffed filet and the ribeye and omg we were in heaven and could not believe how effortless it was to cut off a piece of steak and chew it. it melted in my mouth and was so flavorful and well seasoned. the service was great and attentive. I will most definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now.. And the overall impression of this place is it needs an overhaul on management and service. The food has been pretty decent, except the first visit my ribeye wasn't they great. The second visit I went with the parm chicken and it was fantastic. 

The service is where this place is lacking. The wait staff is horribly unorganized and fumbles everything. Our waitress repeated our dinner order back to us as if we were at a McDonald's drive thru (was awkward). If this place is trying to be a mid to upscale steakhouse they need to hire professional and experience waitstaff! The time it took to get our check and pay took 15 minutes as she was waiting on her other tables first before simply dropping off our check that she had in her hand!
 
Oh, and don't forget the rock hard butter for the soft bread. I really am mind boggled at this. How does anyone think this is a good idea? It basically makes the butter unusable. 

Overall, I won't be going back.. I'm sure there are some good waitresses and waiters in this place but I am 0 for 2 and this place is too expensive to take a chance at."}
{"text":"I feel kind of funny reviewing a chain like Longhorn Steakhouse among my other reviews of unique, locally owned Madison restaurants. But the food here was actually amazing. I've been twice and have gotten the same exact thing both times- parmesan encrusted renegade sirloin & red rock grilled shrimp with rice pilaf and mashed potatoes on the side. The steak and shrimp were delicious and really flavorful (and i love a lot of seasoning on my steak, to the point where others might not like it anymore). The mashed potatoes were incredible, and the butter they come with gets spread over everything on my plate. Something about that butter.....

Also the staff are really down to earth and every time I'm there, I feel like it's one of my friends serving us, and where else can you get steak, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and rice pilaf for under $20. My friends and I are thinking about doing a monthly LongHorn after-work run."}
{"text":"Delicious, melt in you mouth, Outlaw Ribeye, cooked pefectly for 1 medium rare and 2 medium well. Tender and flavorful, loved it with parmesan crust.  Parmesan creamed spinach and unlimited honey wheat bread are delicious. Dessert we got the Chocolate Stampede which I would rename Chocolate Heaven which is a dessert for 2 and is generously portioned for both. Service was fabulous, waitress didn't mind holding things or extras. Bread and drinks were refilled with perfect timing. We were very satisfied here."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken on the salad was excellent with lemon.  Best grilled chicken I have had in a long time, not dry or char. Broiler cook also had the sirloin steak just the way my friend ordered. As well as the chicken strawberry salad. All thee entree spot on.

Also, try the baked sweet, it's large enough for two 

Server was very accommodating and right there for our very need.

Nice relaxing dining.

Thanks we will be back."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has never been big on restaurant chains but I have to say that I really like this location of the Longhorn Steakhouse. My wife and I have gone here a couple times and have always had a good experience. 

The past time our waitress didn't have much personality but I'm sure thats not her fault. She was attentive and brought us refills and checked on us several times. Wish she would have taken our salad bowls away before bringing the main course but maybe it was just an oversight.

overall a good place to get a steak."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!

The Wild West shrimp is the best ever!!! It is the reason why I love coming here.

10.0 - appetizer - Wild West shrimp 

8.0- entree- bacon burger- great and cooked well- mouthwatering taste with fresh flavor

8.0- fries- fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"First time at Longhorn, normally I go to Black Angus but Longhorn was standing out more (great job marketing team). My bartender/server was Jimmy, very kind guy. Had some small talk ordered my usual cocktail consisting of vodka and pineapple juice. Felt a bit spontaneous and called for a green tea shot, INSTEAD I received an amazing Green Tea cocktail, holy f*** this guy is the man. I ordered the lobster filet mignon with an interesting hollandaise sauce, spectacular so was their shrimp and lobster chowder. Thanks for the great experience Jimmy and Longhorn!"}
{"text":"Nov. 25 and Nov. 26, 2016
If you ever go to a state that has a Longhorn steakhouse I highly recommend it. When I went there, there was no wait so they were able to seat us right away. The service is slow but the food is good. I had the 12 oz rib eye medium rare, it is seasoned and cooked perfectly. As for the side order, I ordered the smoked Gouda green beans but they were cold so I sent them back and got the parmesan crusted creamed spinach which was very good and the mac and cheese was so good I had to order another side order of it to go. 
The price is very affordable, it is clean and the decor is very nice.
The staff is friendly but slow, you have to waive them down to get a re-fill on drinks and to get more bread and butter, but I would go back again because the food is good.
The only reason I did not give them a 5 stars is because of the service."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place and tonight was no exception! Our steaks were cooked perfectly, knife slipped through them like butter!! We always get the house salad with Ranch, the ranch dressing has a little zing to it and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to this longhorn steakhouse numerous times and always had decent service and the food has always been good too. I come here for the steaks, as there is only the Outback Steakhouse to compete with in this area. Tonight though, I had the full rack of baby back ribs with loaded baked potato. I blew it of course by eating a salad and the Texas Tonion and bread before my meal. I thought the couple of bb back ribs I ate were tasty. Naturally, we asked for boxes to go. Now I have lunch for work mañana. The salad I had wasn't great. It was iceberg lettuce with a lot of hard stems. Service was good!"}
{"text":"This location is continually \"out of chili\". This item is a favorite for my low carb diet and is one of the main reasons I eat here. I have never encountered this at any other location. What's up?!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants and Longhorn falls into this category.  The food is Eh. When a co-worker picks this as a lunch place I will usually order the 7 pepper sirloin salad which is ok.  However, all of their salad dressing choices are frighteningly full of fat and calories.  How hard is it to add a fat free choice to the menu???"}
{"text":"Ate here for a Yelp Event, what an incredible meal from Longhorn Steak and our Yelp hostess Hailey. 

Fun event getting to meet other Elite Yelpers at this event.

Meal consisted of appetizers which included Fried Green Tomatoes, Sweet Corn Fritters,  Hand Battered Portabellos, Wild West Shrimp and Brew Pub Pretzel Sticks. The Hand Battered Portabello was the hands down best. 

I went with the Roasted Tomato Basil Soup which was very good,  a good consistency and flavorful. Had croutons and a pack of crackers also.

I chose for my entrée the 18 oz Outlaw Ribeye with a baked potato. What a good size cut of beef. Fairly tender and pretty flavorful. 

On the dessert side we shared the chocolate stampede and peach cobbler. The peach cobbler was outstanding!

This was quite a generous complete meal and where I was almost full before the entrée arrived.

Special thanks for the great hospitality from Longhorn Steak for their great service and dinner. They really did a great job of pampering the group.

Also thank you to Hailey for organizing this event and again going above and beyond to setup another special event."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night for a date with my husband. Really no complaints....

Got there just before 6 told the wait would be an hour, ended up waiting about 50 minutes. Which is expected on a Friday night dinner rush. Hostesses were friendly and smiling, Both when we got there and when we left.

Our waitress was attentive, never had to wait for refills on our drinks, she checked on us often which I thought impressive because it was extremely busy and she had several tables, including a table of 9 next to us. She was excellent! 

Food was delicious, had calamari for appetizer which was good. Salads were also yummy and fresh. Husband's steak was delicious (according to him, he likes it rare so I didn't try for myself ;))I had prime rib which was perfect. Loaded baked potato toppings were skimpy but that's minor in my opinion.  

Would definitely recommend for a nice dinner will keep in mind for another date night."}
{"text":"I visit here regularly.  Great service and food, never once complained.  The food is always good and hot (I usually get the ribeye).  Staff doesn't change often, they remember you from previous visits."}
{"text":"Decent chain, good food. I'd give it 5 stars if the services wasn't such a hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Went for hubby's birthday dinner tonight.  
Say what you will about \"chain\" restaurants, but this place rocks.  
We're sitting there, chatting away, and the manager comes to our table, apologizes for the appetizer taking so long, and comps the app.  Holy cow!  We didn't even notice!  We've waited longer for drinks.
We had the Wild West Shrimp for our app.  Excellent.
Hubby had the Outlaw Ribeye for his entree. He was very pleased.  
I had the Flat Iron steak with the stuffed bella shroom.  Very very good.  Will order again.
Too full for dessert, unfortunately.
Manager stopped by out table THREE times during the meal to ask how everything was.  Unbelievable customer service.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's fav restaurant. He gets the salmon and I order my ribeye rare. Our meals come and I already know it's over cooked. I cut it open so the server will be able to see that it's cooked medium. After about 5 minutes the server comes to the table to ask how our meals were and when I tell her my steak is not even close to rare, she responds with, \"I thought it looked over cooked\"...ok then. End of this story, my babe was completely done eating before I got my rare steak. Nothing was offered to us that evening to fix the mistake so I emailed Longhorn to make them aware and at that point they sent me a egift card for the next visit."}
{"text":"My company ordered Longhorn for our Christmas dinner. Almost every meal had something wrong with it. On top of that, requests for bread, butter, and utensils, etc were ignored. I'm having a hard time choosing to spend my money at any of these locations."}
{"text":"Love their steak, max & cheese (I think they add ham or bacon, it's delicious) and broccoli. Yum yum. Customer service has been great every time I been. If it's first time you might want to ask to lower on the salt and spices they use on their steaks, oh and if you are a chocolate lover. Try their lava cake."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner last night.  Ordered the French onion soup.  Came out cold.  Called the waitress over, she took it back, brought it back 10 minutes later, still cold.  Do these people not know how to heat soup?  
Ordered steaks.  When they got there, began to eat them, and after a while, realized that they just didn't taste right.  My mouth began to burn, and I asked the waitress, and she said that it is on the menu that they are \"boldly flavored\".  What does that mean?  Seems the CEO of the company calls in Juan Carlos from the local Mexican restaurant and he rubs his red peppers all over my steak so that I can enjoy his \"boldly flavored\" meal.  To blazes with the CEO and Juan Carlos!! They can eat their steak the way they want, and so will I.  If I wanted my steak hot and spicy, I'd go to a Mexican restaurant and order one.  Who are these idiots to decide to rub this stuff on my steak?  
To the credit of the manager, she did comp the two steak dinners and apologize for the problem, but told me that it was a corporate decision to do it, not a local one, and that if you don't want it on there, you have to ask for it not to be put on the steak.  My response was that it should be offered to me that if I want it, they will add it.  Otherwise, it should be left off and let me decide how I get it, not them.  On top of all that, we were seated and after waiting for 15 minutes had to stop a passing waitress and ask for someone to serve us. All in all, not a place I want to go back to.  There are other good places to go."}
