{"text":"Not for me.  Had the tofu bowl and a side salad.  The fried tofu was cold and chewy, and the fried egg was runny and freezing cold.  The sauce was good and spicy but not enough to cover the ingredients, most of which were flavorless.  Salad was good...same carrots, pickles and radishes as the bowl.  Staff was friendly.  We don't plan to return."}
{"text":"So excited to find a new restaurant gem in Charlotte!! Great outdoor patio seating and located right next to the light rail, super convenient. But let me talk about The Food  the flavors were just fantastic! The fried chicken starter was the winner for our group - super crispy (and not greasy) with the dry rub seasoning  the dumplings were a very close second. I had the spicy pork bowl for my main and paired with some kimchi it was dynamite! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Third time here and still kicks ass! Morgan was great. Food is priced right, authentic, and super tasty. Can't wait till I can experience the whole menu."}
{"text":"First time trying Korean food. Got the bibim box wth the side salad. The food was delicious and fresh, the staff was so friendly and the atmosphere was great. Will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.   Fried Chicken Bowl + BB Wrap + Wife ordered a cocktail. Great service, not too crowded. Chic looking place but the food was on point. Plenty of parking. Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner on a Friday, husband and I shared the crispy tofu bowl and potstickers. The food was excellent and super flavorful - try both sauces. The portion for the bowl was massive (had leftovers). We didn't care for the miso soup (found it too salty). The bowl is not the only vegetarian option. You can substitute crispy tofu on the other dishes. The service was great and friendly. They knew we were in a rush and accommodated us quickly. Can't wait to go again! Depending on the to-go portions, we might make this our new go-to pick up spot."}
{"text":"This place was okay, cute little restaurant near Price's chicken coop. Decently priced for the area. Flavor wise.. it was just to Americanized and bland to be honest. The pickled vegetables were not even pickled.. they were just soggy and bland. And most Korean dishes include pickled vegetables. I was hoping for more flavor from the veggies since the chicken I got had no flavoring at all."}
{"text":"I was actually really disappointed. Food wasn't bad but it wasnt good either, it was just... nothing special.    All of our food came out cold, the miso soup and the japchae (forgot how to spell it). It's actually ridiculous how you have to pay an extra $1 for them to put the bibimbap in a hot stone bowl and you can't keep it?? (I mean, I don't want to keep it but why do I have to pay for something to be properly served) $14 for a bowl, YIKES!    Drinks were ordered but never came out. Which actually worked out because my friend and I were ready to leave anyways.  We should have known when stepping in the restaurant and there was not a Korean soul in sight. If there isn't a Korean man wearing a wife beater tank that doesn't speak a lick of English cooking the food, is it really a Korean restaurant?"}
{"text":"Spicy pork Bibim Bowl served hot pot style. Delicious food, great service!! Hot pot $1.00 extra but worth it!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very excited to finally come & eat here. We can around 7PM & found a perfect seat for two on a Saturday night but quickly got busy. My boyfriend got the chicken bibimbap, which he likes, but he said he liked my Bulgogi Box better. It definitely had lots of flavor & tasted like the traditional Korean Bulgogi but not to be too stingy because we are Korean, it was salty & beef was broken up a lot but it's understandable. The portion is filling (a bit overpriced) but still tasty. I like their potstickers too. Their Bloody Mary is a no go, but that's because we realize we don't like Bloody Mary so for those that do like it, try it out! Service was kind"}
{"text":"This was the most pleasant service experience I've had in a long time. Everything was delectable, from the perfectly crisp honey butter wings that had a nice lime zest to the amazing drinks. The kitchen manager and beverage director Alisa made us our own specially crafted cocktails by pairing fresh roasted fruits with select spices to prepare amazing drinks that weren't even on the menu. The Bulgogi was to die for with tons of meat and the sticky rice was just right!  The atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and relaxing.  The service team here really goes the extra mile to make sure you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I was super excited for this place to open as I lived in Camden Gallery at the time. I've been a few times. I've found it to be overpriced and kind of bland. Nothing about Korean food should be bland! The tofu is over fried and the sauces are kind of Americanized. I also found the service to be pretty slow. I really really wanted to like it and hope they turn it around. It's a killer location and Southend should be all over this type of place. It kind of feels like they need to pick a land: either full on Korean (not some weird fusion) or go the Americanized route. Or go full on Korean fusion - everyone loves a bulgogi beef taco."}
{"text":"Great staff and authentic, true to the culture Korean food. Quaint spot with a great vibe in Southend. A much needed addition to Charlottes growing foodie scene."}
{"text":"My first time trying Korean barbq and I loveeee it. Location, atmosphere, food and BRI our server was amazing!   Definitely a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Food was a little on the expensive side but it tasted delicious and was a very full takeout box! I got the bimbap box with the pork and split it over two meals. The sides didn't sound all that great so I got the Asian slaw which was good. A friend suggested the pickles so those will be next on the list!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on friday and had great service and even better food. Each server checked on us and made us feel welcome and answered our questions. The potstickers were some of the best ive ever had and the spicy pork bowl was awesome!"}
{"text":"Best bulgogi in town. Great craft beer selection and they have Chopin vodka, so bonus star for that. Definitely worth a shot, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Really good food. Will definitely come back soon. Wife had the Spicy Pork Bibim bowl and I had the Beef Bulgogi Box. Both were very good. Food came out fast, service was great too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a quiet, Sunday afternoon. The place is small, but cozy. We were greeted by the waitress, bartender, and I believe the owner/manager. They were all very kind ladies throughout our dining experience. Since the Panthers game was playing, we had asked if we could move from our table to the bar to watch the game from their one TV screen. Our waitress did not mind at all. I ordered the pork bulgogi fried rice and he ordered the beef bibimbap. We are avid Korean food fans, and we already knew this place wasn't your traditional korean food restaurant. We still enjoyed the food, nonetheless, and it was very flavorful. The side dishes were also delicious (I had cucumber pickles and he had kimchi) and fell more on the authentic side. We were satisfied with both the food and customer service so we will be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's definitely a unique & creative menu compared to other Korean places in the area. The atmosphere is good, the cocktails are great, and the servers are friendly.   And the food is SO GOOD! I got the beef handpie which was a nice size, and it came with a side salad and a side. Everything was amazing and it was so much food for $11!! My fianc√© got the beef kimchi fried rice with the added egg. It was spicy but he loved it. We have also been with friends and we all really liked our meals. You really can't beat their Friday special of a beer & potstickers for $10. Their potstickers are VERY good too.  We are adding this place to our regular restaurant rotation. If you haven't been, give it a try!"}
{"text":"So, I'm going to start by saying I might be biased because I live in DC and have tasted awesome bulgogi. I stopped by this past weekend while visiting friends in Charlotte, and was excited to have some awesome korean food. The place was packed when we arrived, so I figured that was a good sign. The food looked good on the menu: we ordered fries and the bibimbap bowl, and miso soup. The waiters/waitress took forever to greet us, brought us the wrong food (and then of course took it away) and then at the end of service mixed up our checks and charged the wrong cards for the wrong orders (we split a ticket...its really not that complicated). The miso soup was not good, at all and the bibimbap lacked flavor. I was really disappointed. Fries and the sauce were really the only thing I liked."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first and I really enjoyed It! We carried out, the setup is a little confusing for takeout (I think it might make more sense towards the door so ppl aren't ordering in the middle of the seating area ). Between the 2of us, we ordered the chicken wings, fried chicken bowl, fried rice and had the side salad and coleslaw. More than enough food for dinner and everything was great! The service was super quick and friendly! I got in and out in about 10 minutes around 8 at night and spoke with both of who I assumed are managers/owners. I will be back and hopefully will try more of the sauces. The only suggestions I have, since I know they are brand new, would I would love to see more side and sauce options, and the register placement ( I felt rude ordering with people eating on both sides of me). Thank you for the great meal and service! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly when we walked in. I ordered the Bibim Bowl and it was amazing! I've tried several Bibimbap hot plates and this place makes it to one of my top 5s! The server that helped us was Bree, her customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out to one of the few Korean spots in Charlotte! I've been super excited to come just because I love Korean food and the place is aesthetically pleasing. I just want to start off by saying that their service is phenomenal! Our waitress is the Marketing Manager and she is absolutely wonderful! Her personality is so upbeat and I loved it.   It was my mom's early birthday dinner so we sneaked a cake and the manager (I think) was so kind to set it up for us and everything. I got the Korean Fried Chicken Bowl and the chicken was really good! The portions are large and I loved the pickles in the dish. I do not like the sauce because it can get overwhelming. I would ask for the sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you want in your dish. The BB Frites are SOOOOO GOOD I mean SOOOOOO GOOD. I'm not a fry person but I could eat these all day!!! Get the fries!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing cooked fresh food. Server was pleasant and eager to explain the ingredients and popular items. The boxes we ordered the spicy pork was mouth watering with the kimchi the best I ever ever had. My wife had the beef box with the poached egg on top that was full flavored with fresh veggies.   Lunch portions are more than enough leaving you full and mouth and tummy happy. Might have to come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great location (with parking inside the garage attached to the building - found a spot even on a Panthers Sunday), great service, friendly staff. Delicious food! We ordered the beef bulogi and the Korean fried chicken. Kimchi was nice and spicy. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Given the limited Korean food options in Charlotte, my friend and I have kept a close eye on this place since the spring. When Bulgogi Box finally opened their doors, we immediately had to check it out, and it did not disappoint! The flavors were spot on, and the staff was pleasant as well. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bibim Bowl for lunch. It was a hefty amount of food, yet the proportions of spicy pork, vegetables, & rice were well-balanced. I enjoyed every bite.  There are a lot of other tempting options on the menu (plus a chalkboard with some enticing happy hour deals), so I plan to keep trying different items and figure out my favorites. Bulgogi Box is a keeper. :D"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious. I got the beef box the first time and the tofu box the second time. Both were amazing. The service is friendly and fast. Great lunch time atmosphere. Would highly recommend if you're looking for good, flavorful Korean food in the area. Just come with a large appetite or prepare yourself for left overs, the portion sizes are quite large."}
{"text":"I have recently become a bit of a fanatic of bibimbap; making my own at home and experimenting with new ingredients. I excitedly ordered the spicy pork bulgogi bowl and was not disappointed. The portion was generous and the spicy sauce left me feeling warm while not being overpowering. I was genuinely surprised at how well the corn and radish worked in the dish!  I also ordered pot stickers as a starter and found the sauce very pleasing. I actually felt a bit empty emotionally upon finishing the pot stickers because I could have easily sat there and consumed them on their own until full.  The staff were very relaxed and friendly and I didn't feel rushed at all, which is something I've come to expect while stateside."}
{"text":"Morgan was the best bartender I've ever had. I rarely drink. But she made me laugh and made the best drinks. They were different tasting because of the ingredients. Overall they were amazing. The Beef Bulgogi Box was absolutely amazing. It was absolutely favorite thing. My boyfriend, Justin had something amazing too. You had him eating stuff he never does. Which surprised me. They B.B Fritta's were amazing. I thought with the seasoning it would be spicy but it surprised me. They were not! I love this place. Morgan was the best server/Bartender. The food and service was amazing. I highly recommend it. The dish I recommend is the Beef Bulgogi Box."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what you get. Which Asian restaurant doesn't offer chopsticks? I asked for some and they didn't have any. First off, my food came out very cold. I ordered the fried Korean chicken dish and it looked like nuggets in my bowl. The chicken was very hard to chew and the vegetables that came along with the dish didn't have a lot of flavoring going on. The size of the restaurant is very tight, I had to constantly move my chair several times for the staff to come through with people's food."}
{"text":"If I could I would give 3.5 stars. Since this is not possible I will give only 3 instead of 4 because I wasn't really impressed.  First of all this place is really overpriced for the amount the food they serve.  The service was okay, the food was good but I was really expecting way more.  I had a \"beef bowl\" and miso soup. The miso was very unique, the beef bowl was okay. My husband ordered something that reminded us of a taco. He really enjoyed his meal. It had some seasoned French fries with a hot dipping sauce.  My mother-in-law had steak with white rice and we shared an order of fried wings. The wings were fine nothing impressive. At the end we order a lemon raspberry cheesecake  cake or something like that. It was half cake and half cheesecake. That thing was really delicious!!!! Very creative, flavorful, moist dessert.  Other than the dessert I don't see other reason to go back. Oh before I forget they have neutral gender restrooms. I thought it was a great differential!"}
{"text":"Great fast lunch option during Small Business Saturday.  We really loved the food, I had the Bulgogi Bowl and my husband had the Bulgogi Wrap.  The service was fast and friendly, the decor and ambience are fresh and clean, and the music level was low enough to be enjoyable, but not too loud.  I have been waiting on a non-fusion Korean restaurant to open in town and this is as close as you can come in the downtown Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good Korean food in Charlotte for a while now. I'm glad I found it! Not unreasonable prices for lunch either."}
{"text":"Food: I had the Bibim bowl with a side of miso. The flavor of both was OK, a bit bland. The miso had deep fried tofu I didn't care for. The bibim bowl sauce was just spicy, not particularly flavorful. Overall I enjoyed it but wouldn't repeat.   The thing that turned me off was that the bowl was sooo oily. I had a half a bowl of leftovers wich I mixed with clean rice and it's still pretty oily. The veggies were very well done, tho. The meat was oily too.  Staff: from hostess to servers: extremely nice and accompdating. The best part about the place!  Overall OK, but a bit bland and too heavy."}
{"text":"Overall my experience was just okay. We came opening week and the food appeared to be rushed. I had the bulgogi box and the beef didn't have much seasoning. The staff is very friendly and the drinks are well made so I will definitely check them out in the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for authentic Korean food.   Staff and owner are super friendly,  and the service is excellent. Morgan is a trip... perfect personality for running the bar.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Charlotte for a second time this year, the first stop was to head to Bulgogi Box. I can't believe I didn't write a review previously.  My husband and I visited twice in a week because the food is delicious. So as we were planning our drive here, we knew it would be first on the list for lunch.  The spicy pork bulgogi is amazing. So tasty, so spicy, so good. The coleslaw that comes with it was different than it was last time, it seems like they added a lot of pepper. I liked it better before as it was a nice cool down next to such a spicy dish. This time it was just too much spice so I couldn't eat it all. And I like spicy everything.  Service is great and the restaurant is always nice. Fast service, friendly faces, excellent food for the win!"}
{"text":"We had the best service than we've had in a long time at a fast casual restaurant. We appreciated the variety of the menu in that you can mix and match with the included side in each entree. Good portion size. Delicious with flavor in every bite. Highly recommend the B.B. Salad. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really flavorful food! I went for lunch today and was really impressed. I got the spicy pork Bulgogi Box and it was full of flavor. It comes with a spicy sauce on the side- the sauce is very spicy (which I really liked) but use it sparingly.  The food came out quickly so this is a nice place for a quick lunch. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sads.  I\"m not sure what went wrong with this place.  There is so much potential for class act East and SE Asian food in Charlotte given the ever expanding population of folks from that part of the world.  Super G on Independence, the Laotian take out place on Tyvola, and classics like Lang Vanh are all exemplary of the trends.  Having said that, I was bummed to bring my friend here for his first taste of Bulgoki.  For anyone who's ever had real Korean food, bulgoki should come hot as fuck, in a bowl you can't touch, with crispy rice, fresh veg, and a perfectly poached egg to slather on top.  The poached egg at this joint is commendable, but other than that, the meal was an entire let down.  The veg was cold and acrid, the rice was also cold and mealy.  There were weird pieces of chicken in my friends bowl that were so hard they were inedible. To top things off:  you have to pay extra to have the food brought in a bulgoiki bowl!  WTF.  Bulgoki, by definition, is all about the hot bowl and crispy rice.  Instead you get a bowl of cold rice with vegetables and some meat on top.  That's so not Korean bulgoki :(    At $14 a pop, w/out the hot bowl, I was baffled by the whole experience.  If you want amazing Korean food, take the time to drive out to the food market and deli at Super G.  It's bomb, super authentic, and well worth the trip.  Plus you can get the best bubble tea in town on your way out.  Certainly don't bring a \"first timer\" to Bulgoki Box.  It'll make them question, if not choose to not try, Korean food, and that'd be a shame."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Moved to Charlotte from the DC area, which has a *ton* of Korean restaurants. Outside of the more traditional Pepero, which is a bit far from us, Bulgogi Box is the only Korean restaurant that we've found in Charlotte that has impressed us and earned repeat visits.   Bulgogi Box is a modern take on Korean cuisine that keeps the flavors close to home while still making each dish their own. The staff are friendly as well and make sure that you are well taken care of.  My girlfriend and I have been twice in the past month or so and have ordered the same thing both times: Two spicy pork bulgogi boxes with kimchi as the side, as well as dumplings and kalbi for appetizers.  The dumplings have strong, fresh flavors and we're pretty sure they're hand made. The kalbi(beef short ribs) are marinated perfectly and the meat is delicious. The spicy pork bulgogi box consists of pork with the traditional spicy red Korean sauce based on gochujang, some onions, and underneath a bed of well cooked white rice. The \"bulgogi box\" is actually served in a bowl, but don't worry -- you'll probably need a box anyways as the portion sizes are generous enough that finishing it all is hard."}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I visited Bulgogi Box for lunch on a weekday.We went around 11:30am with no crowd which was a plus for us.The staff members are welcoming,as well as helpful within recommending different dishes per your liking.We all ordered different dishes.When I asked for everyone's feedback,they all stated they enjoyed the unique taste of their dishes,the pricing,and the service.We all believed it should be rated a 5!  Here are a few pictures attached!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Food was outstanding, generous portions with a good flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a Korean spot in Charlotte, much less a GOOD Korean spot. I stumbled on this little restaurant in the heart of southend. I saw Bulgogi and I was like \"HECK. YES.\" So I went in. The place is fairly new, waitress said it opened in September.   The service was exceptional, the lady I assume to be the owner was very welcoming and happy to have customers.  I got the Beef Bulgogi Box. I read on here that the portion sizes were small. Boy was that a lie. It was massive, the plating was aesthetic, worthy of a photo if you're the kind of person to post food pics on social media.   The taste was good. Is it the best Bulgogi I've ever had? Not by a long shot. But definitely good. You'll find yourself short on complaints.  I've paid way more for Bulgogi so I was satisfied.   All in all, good restauarant. Hope more Korean Spots show up in Charlotte in the futures"}
{"text":"I am Korean who live in Atlanta. It is very delicious to me. Especially, gochujang (spicy hot chilly sauce) was wonderful. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"I started with a bold Missy stout, recommended by Alisa and Morgan. For my Appetizer I had the potstickers! Delicious! Also the B B frites were amazing! Recommend this place if you haven't tried! Super nice staff, lots of teamwork and restrooms were tidy and clean! will be returning!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this Korean restaurant in the heart of Southend right near Price's Chicken. Great outdoor patio with a stellar view of uptown Charlotte. The food was on point. The dumplings were unique with a great dipping sauce. The fried chicken is awesome, super crispy with a sweet and spicy flavor. For my entree my husband and I shared the bulgogi box (beef and rice) and the bimbim bowl (pork vegetables and rice) Great flavor  in all of the dishes. To top it off they serve artisan ginger and cherry gelato from a local shop. Can't wait to go back and try some cocktails and the fried chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"The food is quite delightful. The wait staff is incredible. Give it a try! You will not be disappointed! I went with the Bimbim bowl. It is quite delightful. Their kimchi is spicy and sweet, very tasty. I will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"We came here for my aunts birthday, but Let me just start off saying their service is AWESOME! Everyone is just so friendly and I loved our waitress attitude! Now the decor, very nice and aesthetic. We started off with the fries and OMG SO FRIGGIN GOOD. It was crisp and perfectly seasoned! One of the best fries I've had I swear!! I had the tofu bowl, and it was also really good. There was a variety of different food in my bowl and the tofu was perfectly crunchy/crisp. I also love the sauce that was on there. Btw the portions are huggge! I couldn't even finish my bowl!! (:"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and have been twice now. The service has been amazing both times as well as the food. My food was always hot and seasoned perfectly. The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave suggestions. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers, drinks and ambiance! Try the Suntoki Japanese whiskey! Staff was accommodating and friendly"}
{"text":"The atmosphere coming into this restaurant was very welcoming. The staff was very thrilled right when I come into the door. The beer list had updated options and had a lot of diversity.  I got the tofu bowl and it was s o o o o good! A ton of flavor and they have a tong of options for Amy type of diet there is. I love they offer unique sides with their entrees too"}
{"text":"`5 stars because everything I tasted here, even the water was good. Not a lot of restaurants can do one type of food with a twist and get it right. To me, Bulgogi is Korean with a southern twist. Every single ingredient in the fried chicken bowl dish was delicious and fresh.  It's a very tight, very small restaurant but definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Bulgogi Box is a cute concept. Their style is the perfect fit for Southend. The restaurant is small on the inside. There is outdoor seating but it was way too hot to sit outside on the day we went. We ordered the beef bowl and chicken bowl. The beef was better. (In our opinion)   It's an American-Asian taste, so not authentic.  We understand that service can get busy, but the cashier kept rushing us to leave so other guests can sit. He started 5 minutes after we got our food:("}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's one of the first places I visited when moving to Charlotte from DC. The food is amazing. I especially like the B.B Wrap and B.B. Salad with the Korean Fried Chicken. The Bimbim Bowl is also awesome.   The service is good, the food comes out relatively fast. I've only been here midday so I don't know how busy it gets. But I like that it's conveniently located just off of the light rail.   They also have a bar that does Half priced wine by the glass in Thursday's."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 12:30 on a Tuesday. The miso soup was pretty good, nice and warm on a cold day. I ordered the Bibim bowl with the spicy pork. Wow it was a beautiful dish but it was underwhelming. It was that weird temperature where you know it's not supposed to be a cold dish but it's by no means hot... or warm even. I watched them make it too so I know it didn't sit long before getting to me.   Service was good but there were only 3 tables so hard to have bad service then.   Overall is was that doesn't-taste-as-good-as-it-looks heartbreak. The spicy pork wasn't spicy at all. For having a lot of ingredients, it wasn't overly flavorful.  EDIT: knocked it down to 2 stars. Reheated the leftovers (I'm a leftover queen) and it was inedible. Like I had to throw it away and go get something else which I NEVER do. I don't think the only issue was it being cold."}
{"text":"I always get their B.B. Wrap. The flavor is good and portion is generous. The fries come with the meal, which are pretty good too. Charlotte is lack of good Korean cuisine so it's nice to have a restaurant like Bulgogi Box in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great all around. In no particular order...1) Space: it is a great atmosphere. It's open with very high ceilings, yet still feels cozy by nature of the nice seating. It feels fresh and clean inside. 2) Staff: Extremely friendly, just as attentive as you want, yet not overly so. The manager came by and made sure we were enjoying things. 3) Food: AMAZING. I don't know of anywhere else in Charlotte you can get this kind of Korean food. It reminds of a place I've been in NYC. Both of our dishes were extremely flavorful and pleasing to the eye. The portions were generous as well. Service was fast.  They also had a good amount of local beer on tap and a good drink menu."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, looks new, modern, neutral colors, nice decorations. But the food? I think they could do a little bit better. The appetizer Kalbi came with 3 pieces and coleslaw. Two of the short ribs looked fine but the other one looked really old, dark, and tough to chew. My father could tell right away when the server brought it out to us. The coleslaw was fine. My Beef Bulgogi Box dish with white rice was ok.. the beef was a little bit burnt. The salad that came with it was actually really good. Fresh, clean cut, tasty dressing. Loved it. My father had the Bibim Bowl and it was good. Lots of vegetables, large portion, very tasty. Service was great, restaurant was clean, loved the decorations. I would come back to try other dishes but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"My Korean friend, Tom, has been very eager to share this restaurant experience with me.  Finally, we met up today in the south end and made this a reality.  I appreciated his expertise with the menu options.  If anyone knows Korean food, it is Tom.  I ordered a tofu bowl that came with corn and mushrooms and collard greens.  It was served over rice and there's was a runny egg on top, which Initially turned me off, but I ended up liking it.  Runny yolks are typically just not my thing. The tofu looked like tiny croutons and I loved it.  Tom pointed out the small details that are very typical in Korean restaurants.  Examples were how the silverware was completely enfolded in the napkins, the sauces came in individual bowls versus squeeze bottles, and the lemon slices came on skewers in a little bowl.  The atmosphere here is very trendy. The server was Korean and very efficient.    The only downfall was the noise level.  The high ceilings and hard surfaces were just not good for acoustics, however the visual appeal was fabulous.   Good value for the money.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Highly recommend stopping in for lunch, dinner or for take-out. The beef box is a good place to start with pieces of tender beef mixed in. The spicy pork and fried rice is also recommended."}
{"text":"get you the b.b. wrap or if you just want a giant bowl of meat then you GET that bulgogi box and you chow down!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, and delicious bimbop! The atmosphere is trendy. Everything on the menu has been good--bimbop, Korean southern fried chicken bowl and beef bugolgi. Stop by at least one a week."}
{"text":"Overpriced and so-so food. 2.5 stars. Wanted to love it as I am a huge Korean food fan.  But this place, while having great ambiance and service, misses the mark on the food.  Flavor is just not there and my dish was greasy-not a good combo. Plus it was like $14 for a bowl at lunch.  That's crap.  In Atlanta for $12 I get absolutely gorged on amazing flavorful Korean with tons of extra small dishes.   Bottom line: decent restaurant but don't expect anything like a reasonable Korean experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and service. I had a Korean fried chicken bowl that was delicious. Went for lunch and was in and out quickly. Would try again to explore other dishes."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the South End area!  I met up with a friend for dinner. This was our first time visiting Bulgogi Box.  I tried to look up an online menu, but there's no website unless I missed it?   Bulgogi Box is located on the corner of West Blvd. and Camden Rd. There's a free parking deck. I can't remember if street parking is available or not. This restaurant is small and charming, the staff is GREAT! Our waitress was informative and fun, she gave awesome suggestions without pushing us to order. There are daily specials every day, be sure to take advantage of them!  We started with Miso soup and Potstickers which are basically pan-seared dumplings,  I think the filling was pork and chicken. We also ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Wings, this was my personal favorite!  There are a few flavor options to choose from. We tried the honey butter and spicy Korean red. Most people love the honey butter, this was a little plain for my palate. The spicy Korean red was a more mild sweet flavor which I LOVED!  Our Entrees! We selected the Beef Bulgogi and Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box. Both entrees were served with sauteed onions, scallions, and white rice. I love pork! However, I think the Beef Bulgogi was better in my opinion. Who am I kidding! I should've placed a to go order.  So will I come back? Uhhh YES!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Camden Corridor. Food was excellent and I couldn't believe how crowded it was on their opening day!!   The patio offers amazing views of the city and inside is very cozy. The drink menu is rather extensive given the restaurants size and drinks are super affordable. I got the beef Bulgogi Box and it was great. Portion was perfect as I was full after but not too full. Awesome to have in South End"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and authentic. The wait staff was very friendly and they have some good beers on tap."}
{"text":"Went last Friday for the first time and was very impressed.  Had the pork belly and the dumpling appetizer and the spicy Bibim Bowl. All were great.  Service was friendly and fast.    No bad press intended, only a few suggestions...I understand Charlotte is a beer city, and I love our local beer, but I would have liked to have had a Cass or Hite Korean beer, rather than an IPA. So it would be nice to see that on the beer list.   Also the traditional side dishes that typically come with a. Korean meal would be great as well.  Also would be nice to just have chopsticks rather than having to ask for them."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks.  Wednesday wing/whiskey special is amazing!!!  Nice welcome decor.  Will definitely be back.  Morgan is so cool. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Taste: 1/5. we ordered a bulgogi rice bowl and Bibimbap on hot stone bowl which was not at all hot. Bulgogi is burnt and my friend can literally taste the burn. Bibimbap seems to have way too many peppers... Both are very oily, very very oily.   Price?3/5. Given the taste of the food, $15 for a poorly cooked non-hot hot stone (extra $1) Bibimbap and $14 for a burnt Bulgogi bowl are definitely overpriced.   Service & Environment: 4/5 Nothing to complain."}
{"text":"During our first visit we had the Kalbi beef, spicy pork Bibim bowl, and the Korean fried chicken bowl. All of these were delicious! I've been dying for a Korean restaurant in Charlotte and Bulgogi Box did the trick! The service was great too. Love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and atmosphere. Staff is super friendly as well. South End needs more places like this."}
{"text":"3rd time's a charm. We attempted to go one night after a Panther's game, but they close early on Sundays. We then tried again the next day, and realized they close on Monday. Last night was a success! So make sure to look at their hours of operation before going;) But let's just say it was worth the effort and wait! I got the Bibim bowl with spicy pork and my fianc√© got the Fried Chicken bowl. Both were absolutely delicious! They were flavorful and very good portions. I had cole slaw as a side and he got the side salad with lemon ginger dressing. I actually preferred his side salad over my cole slaw. The pork dumplings were also very good as an appetizer. We sat outside on the patio and had a very nice experience. It was a great place to people watch too since you were in the heart of Southend. The wait staff were friendly, fast, and accommodating. Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you like good food, good atmosphere, and good people watching."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is nice but the food is lacking the love and soul.  This ahould not be considered Korean food and is not even good American Korean food. Would strongly auggeat the restaurant learn how to make proper Bulgogi or change it's menu away from Korean food. What do u think?"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ at a reasonable price. Especially friendly and service oriented staff that make you feel welcome and catered to.  Add to it great food and you have a winning combo.  Highly recommend, especially on half price wine night (Thursday)."}
{"text":"We were in the Queen City and wanted some Korean. Actually, Korean BBQ, but some are closed or opened at 430p which I cannot stand. But we yelped and found Bulgogi Bix and we went for it. This place was in a nice location and we were greeted right away (later found out it was the owner of this establishment). The exterior and interior was perfect for this kind of setting. We ordered spicy Korean chicken wings and two hot pot bim bim bowl. Everything was very good. My buddy who never had Korean food before loved it. Service was excellent even at their lunch time. Definitely go here again. Also, the owner who's was the greeter was very hospitable, friendly and always had a greeting smile when anyone came in for eating in and take out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.   I didn't know what to order at first, at the time the hostess said they didn't have any pictures for social media to help decide.  I was pretty indecisive and everyone remained super friendly still.  I ended up getting the fried tofu bowl and ate the entire thing! I thought the sauce that was drizzled would be too much at first (I normally wouldn't add on my own) but it was the perfect.  Glad Charlotte has a decent Korean spot now!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Camden street, with a nice outdoor patio and fast-casual style food.  Go on wednesdays for half-off all wines and enjoy a bimbap bowl! Mine was plenty for 2 meals, which is always a plus. Also I recommend getting your bowl hot so that the rice comes out hot and crispy, it's a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Charged me $1 without asking me for the sizzling hot plate option is seriously a bad business practice.  And using a fork to serve on a rice bowl?  Have u heard of a spoon?  Still having a goose bump from thinking about it.  Pan fried dumpling is soggy and chewy.  Oh one last thing, ALL of the food were not flavorful, and even pouring the whole citrus soy sauce that came with the dumpling did not help.  Pretty disappointed on my first and my only visit."}
{"text":"Bulgogi Box is by far my favorite Korean restaurant!!  From the awesome food, to the awesome service. Bulgogi Box is spot on.   Very fast, prompt, professional staff.  The owners are not afraid greet customers.  Awesome bar, free 2 hour parking, clean, fresh food.   Great selection of craft beer, cocktails, and wine!  Heated patio with a great clear view of uptown Charlotte.   I Recommend the beef Bulgogi Box, Korean fried chicken bowl, and the Bibim bowl!     Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It's a fun little spot with good food. I got the spicy pork and the flavor was great. The portion size was exactly what I needed. For my side, I got the kimchi, which was phenomenal. The decor is nice and the staff is very friendly. It had been a while since I had been to a Korean restaurant, so I had some questions about the menu and the staff was knowledgeable and willing to help. It was a good experience and I'll be heading back soon."}
{"text":"Food was good. Small portions for the price. Forgot to bring silver wear and a side salad.   Prices on the menu were different than prices charged but once it was pointed out the manager fixed it."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Korean food, I was excited to check out this new location near me in South End. There was a lot of things we wanted to try on the menu but limited our choices to the entrees below:  Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box - I originally wanted the Spicy Pork Bibim Bowl and even though I was hesitant to order because they charged $1 extra to be served in a clay pot, they didn't have any and said they were on order. My next choice was the Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box. It honestly was kind of bland and lacking a lot of flavors, especially if you're use to authentic spicy pork bulgogi.  Korean Fried Chicken B.B. Wrap - I LOVE scallion pancakes so we had to give this a try.  It's a very interesting concept considering that scallion pancakes are a Chinese dish.  The chicken was a little on the dry side and the wrap could definitely use more flavors.  It was also difficult to eat without falling apart everywhere so I would recommend cutting it in half. Overall, I could see this dish being pretty tasty with some improvement.  Overall this place was ok.  The service was great but I was really disappointed when I asked for chopsticks, only to find out they didn't have any and said it was on order.  I felt as if they took away from the dining experience because what chopstick user eats Korean food with a fork? Also, it would also be nice to offer kimchi to accompany the dishes since it's a Korean staple but then again, I don't think they're aiming to be traditional.  If you're use to authentic Korean food, you might be a little disappointed in this place.  Being that they're new, I hope things improve and maybe I'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"I decided to give Bulgogi Box a try today, and I am so glad that I did!  The atmosphere is so lovely and the staff was absolutely amazing!  I ordered take-out, but ended up staying for an hour.  The specialty cocktails were so great and very reasonably priced.  The owner was in and she was extremely welcoming and warm.  My food was delicious even though it had sat for an hour before I ate it.  I highly recommend this place.  This is my first Yelp review, so that's should speak for how great my experience was!"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ! They accommodated a large group with no question.  Great local beers and drink specials.  The only negative is that the miso was a little saltier than we would prefer.  The fried chicken bowl was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Eh - it was okay. The service was great and we LOVED the wings. The entrees were, honestly, unmemorable. There wasn't a lot of flavor and it wasn't anything that left us wowed. I don't think we'd be opposed to coming back but it's been a few months and we haven't gone out of our way to revisit."}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch. Their outdoor seating area is pleasant. I had the fried tofu and was pleased with the food. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"We went with a large group at lunch and everyone enjoyed their food. The Korean fried chicken bowl and the Bibim bowl were both very good. Definitely make sure to ask for more sauce with the Korean fried chicken bowl because it's very dry without it. We also got the raspberry and ginger gelato and it was some of the best gelato that I've ever had. The service was pretty fast. I'll definitely be coming back again"}
{"text":"Why haven't I come here sooner?!  This place is within walking distance of my house, so we were very excited to try! We decided to sit at the bar. We received a kind greeting from the bartender.   We decided to try a few things off the menu, and I was glad we got to taste a bit of everything!   Started with the Tea-quila party cocktail. It was ok. I wasn't too impressed. I probably will not order another cocktail here.   We began with the pot stickers. Delicious!  Then ordered two entrees with sides. Bibim spicy pork bowl and the Jabchae hand pie. Also got Asian coleslaw side and side salad and pickles. Surprisingly, the hand pie was my favorite! The sides were also delicious. Bibim bowl was also good. I was just really surprised with how much I liked the hand pie.   The owner came up to us after we had finished our meal and asked us how everything was. She was so kind and grateful for our business. I want to come back just for her."}
{"text":"I came to North Carolina to visit my friend and while I was by myself on the second day. I was yelping for dinner that was close by Charlotte and came across Bulgogi Box. It was a couple stops away and close by to the train stop, which was very convenient for me. The staff was very nice and the menu, I guess or was considered American-Korean fusion. I ordered the crispy tofu box and it was surprisingly good. I went back to my hotel room after an hour and to my surprise the tofu was still crispy and maintained its crunch! Although I asked for a spicy aioli that never made it to my tofu box.. But overall the food was still great. I wish I stayed a bit longer and had a chance to order and try more food from their menu! Recommend this place for vegetarians and non vegetarians, this place is inexpensive and worth the price."}
{"text":"We have tried multiple times to check out Bulgogi Box to no avail (they're closed on Mondays and apparently that's when I want Korean food?), but we finally have achieved mission success!   The Lady and I checked out Bulgogi Box pretty close to closing, maybe around 9:15 for a late dinner. It's a lot more sit-down oriented than I thought, but still a relatively small seating space. Our food came out pretty quickly, and was piping hot! I ordered the Beef Bulgogi Box, which I was honestly a bit tentative about because... I mean, it's $14 for beef, rice, and some scallions.   Naw fam. It's way more than that. And it honestly made 2.5 meals for me. The beef was incredibly tasty and moist and the spice level was PERFECT. Ingredients were high quality and cooked well, and that justifies the price for me. The Lady's meal came out awesome as well, she ordered the hand pie. We both got the cole slaw, which while fresh, was nothing really that special.   I will say that when we arrived, they had run out of several things (ingredients like pickled veggies) which took a few options off the table for us, so that is the only reason why I'm taking off a star. We'll absolutely be back here again to try some more menu items, and I'm looking forward to exploring more of what they're menu has to offer! South End gets another point from me!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Spicy pork bulgogi with extra gojuchuang sauce is my favorite. Salad, Asian coleslaw, miso soup are good. Their lemon raspberry cake is delish. They also have good kalbi and bibambop (sizzling plate doesn't sizzle so wouldn't get it for the extra $1)."}
{"text":"Yikes! That was terrible...  I have never found a good reason to poorly rate a restaurant, but my experience at Bulgogi Box tonight deserves a review.   We were greeted by your very cheery \"marketing manager\" she asked how we had heard about the fairly new location and encouraged us to \"follow...follow...follow\" \"share...share...share\"! So at your request ma'am, here goes.    Your service was terrible. I witnessed the table my right confront their server about being slipped a $ up-charge for a \"sizzling bowl\" that was not requested and was in awe as the server explained she had done it for his own good \"it's hard to explain table side.\"   The table to the left waited so long on the server to touch back that one of the guys finally walked up to the bar to pay. It's important I mention there were only 5 small tables of customers in the whole place, including us, and there were 3 servers/staff.  That should have been our hint, but we stuck with our game plan. We ordered two bowls from our server (same lady from the other two tables). Her personality could have used a sprinkle of warmth, but to each their own.  Food came out quickly, mind you it's 8:45pm, and all other diners have left. The food hit the table and the 3 servers/staff (marketing manager included) immediately began to close up shop. Music turned way up, talking across the room, banging and clanging, vacuuming, etc. No one ever checked in on us. We seemed to be holding them back from closing their doors at 9:00pm. It should be noted their operating hours are until 10:00pm. We quickly ate, feeling uncomfortable, and walked up to the  bar to pay the check we were never given, as we walked out the door.   Just a bit of advice Bulgogi Box. If you are admittedly having trouble generating business, and creating a reputation in the South End neighborhood, start with customer service! Your food was just okay, and your ambiance was cookie cutter. Restaurants prosper or fail through guests' experiences."}
{"text":"Eh.... I was hoping for more. The bogogi was good. Super tender and flavorful. But the bowl was on the small side. The fried chicken bowl looked great and came with a nice variety of veggies. The chicken was very well cooked and could not have possibly had less flavor. The side salad was worthless. The miso was decent. I ordered a beer. They never brought it but still charged me for it. Weak. Atmosphere = meh.  3 star it is."}
{"text":"Very quaint place, and loved the options for vegan/vegetarian people.  Food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim, awesome food at a good price.  Went with the Spicy Pork Bibim Bowl, gf went with the Tofu Bowl, both came with a side (of which we opted for Salad). We also ordered drinks (Beer & a Peach Bellini the bartender whipped up on request) and the Potstickers. Food came out quickly, at expected temperature and was delicious. Service was prompt, friendly, while not being overbearing. Overall, a new favorite spot for something different that is convenient to Uptown.  Will certainly be back for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Ok guys so I returned to Bulgogi Box for the third time and great news things have gotten better ! I have this weird desire to see this place do well since I live in the neighborhood. So the flavor is back !!! What I was most impressed with was how the staff handled the situation of it being a very busy day . Everyone outside seemed to enjoy their food as well . Good job Bulgogi Box ! South End is rooting for you !"}
{"text":"Finally, a Korean restaurant Uptown! The menu is short and sweet. I highly recommend the LA Kalbi and Korean fried rice. The fried rice is not prepared with Spam, so needless to say you'll be paying the Americanized tax. But the recipe is still very good. Service was prompt and friendly; the interior design is urban hipster. Thursday night wine selection is top notch. Thank you Alisa for the great wine recs and for boxing up the kalbi bones for my Mung Mung."}
{"text":"Wow!! I love this place. I've been back twice and the food is so delicious! I've been searching for some good Korean food in Charlotte for so long and this is hands down my favorite. I get the bimimbap and a side of kimchi. They have great specials and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Bulgogi Box on Small Business Saturday. I was able to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere which was amazing. The food was delicious but 2 things really gave me a bad taste. The service, while friendly, was very slow. No one checked on me from the time I got my food until I asked for the bill. I had to wait about 10 min to get my card back while I watched my waiter take additional orders and bring food to other tables. Secondly, I watched as my server took a bowl, the same that my B.B. Frites were served in, and filled it with water so that a dog at the next table can drink out of!!! That is when I asked for my check. That is beyond unsanitary!!! Just from a perception standpoint, they should not be using serving bowls for pets. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was great! I think they're still trying to figure out their service model (it was not great, staff seemed more enthusiastic about rolling silverware than helping us), but I will definitely be back to give them another shot. At the very least will be back for takeout.   We got the bowl and the hand pie and both were delicious. So glad to have this in Southend!"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 in my book. I was excited for this restaurant to open because I love Korean cuisine (I had already drafted my review with 5-stars), but I was not impressed.   The setup and ambiance fits perfectly into the flare of South End. However, it can get a little crowded and confusing if you're trying to order to-go, as there's not a good flow (we'll count that to the newness). The menu is pretty straight forward and the prices represent the surrounding area, so keep that in mind before going all out.   I initially wanted to give the Korean Wings a try, but I decided to try the Beef Bulgogi Box and that totaled to $12.87... a little steep for lunch, but I figured what the heck! The cashier was nice and the other employees seemed to be smiling, so that counted towards the meal being worth it (maybe?Idk).   I was provided a number and waited at the small table facing the window. I wasn't quite sure how I would know my order was ready, as there was not an announcement. I soon learned that there was a young lady with to-go orders going around to each person with a number to give them their order (there's room for improvement with that process, but again let's count it to the newness). Once I received my order, I was out of the door 15-20 minutes tops... which is typical for any busy lunch area.   My disappointment came when preparing to enjoy my lunch. The Beef Bulgogi box is a very small portion for the price. The serving size could fit in my hand (by healthy standards that's a good thing, don't get me wrong... but I wasn't aiming to be healthy lol) and I probably would have let all of this slide had the taste been worth it. The beef taste as if it was grilled and tossed in soy sauce, then called Korean; very Americanized. Not to mention, once I started eating I realized that the beef consisted of more fat than actual meat.   I cannot say that I will be trying this place again any time soon, but I am not going to count them out. By all means fellow Yelpers, go support this local business and provide your feedback, as your experience may be much better than mine. I simply look forward to the improvements."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It's more authentically Korean than Seoul food and the wait staff is fantastic.  Even when we order pick up from this place, the servers could not be more smiley and helpful.  They literally ask us in three different ways if there's anything we need/want whether we're ordering take out or dine in.  Another great example of the help staff at this restaurant: their bathrooms are fkn impeccable.  They always smell rosy and look like they've just been disinfected.  I strongly support any restaurant who pays attention to so much detail that the bathroom is fantastic because they probably share that attention to detail and cleanliness with the kitchen and food."}
