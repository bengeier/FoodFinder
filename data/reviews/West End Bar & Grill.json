{"text":"My wife & I stopped in for breakfast on Sunday after church and wanted to try the West End Bar & Grill. We had a wonderful waitress (Lily) who was very attentive and so we asked her if we could talk to the owner, who by the way was walking around, and she said she would tell the owner our request..The owner (a lady) walked by us on several occasions and ignored us and never did come to our table and talk to us. That my friends is stupid and poor customer service and protocol if you intend to attract more business form the community because word of mouth in this community will destroy you.  I have no idea what her problem was in not wanting to talk to us but the waitress did her part and that was all we could ask for..Tip: do not order the hash browns or the apple juice , which by the way was not very cold."}
{"text":"Place is great but has some serious problems.  Waitress was great and attentive.  Atmosphere was like beautifully designed south side of town design.  Food was 5 stars but........

We ordered 3 simple appetizers with no one else in place and it took 35 minutes to get food.  Another 2 people came in 20 minutes after we ordered and ordered full meals and they got their food before we did.

We noticed the hispanic cooks seems to do the other 2 customers food first because they were hispanic.

Be prepared for crappy times on food due to mismanagement and improper training."}
{"text":"New owners are doing a great job renovating the place. Great food and a good vibe when you walk in. Check it out, it's called Boots N Bourbon now!"}
{"text":"Based on our experience this establishment's 2 1/2star rating is well deserved. No beer selection, it closes at 8 on Thursday (it is in Sun City West after all), the server did not know the VERY few draft beers available or the answer to many of our other questions about the food and drink. I was able to find a Goose Island IPA, fortunately. No local beers either. Food was passable. Wife liked the hot roast beef sandwich but her margarita was funky."}
{"text":"the new  establishment owners removed a couple with a service dog at the bar.insasne behavior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good in the morning but if you go to get alcohol in the morning they dont serve it until 10am. Working night shift i get off at 8am which is my 8pm and i cant get a drink.... frustration"}
{"text":"Industrial steampunkish vibe. Non chain bar and grill, hidden off Grand Ave, behind Goodwill. Glad to find it. Casual, easy going place. Big TVs, football and oldies music playing. The service is great. Norman took care of us very well. Good selection on the menu, they have breakfast too. My Sonoran beef salad had avocado, black beans and corn. Would have spiced up the dressing a little more. Hubby had a sandwich with pozole. The soup was good, lots of hominy. Onion rings were good and crunchy. Nice beer selection. Definitely a come back again place."}
{"text":"Always went on Fridays once or twice a month for fish fry. Didn't know of the change in ownership and was surprised last night. Dar ordered the catfish and I the usual fish fry. Waiting time was average but few customers and no entertainment. Food arrived and we couldn't believe the size of Dar's order, so small it wasn't hardly an appetizer. Mine was huge, I gave her 1/2 a piece of mine but neither of us like the beer batter seasoning and didn't each all of it. The bright side, they got rid of the so called \"Service Dogs\" which in a lot of cases is false. Overall we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great bar and kitchen.  The bartenders are speedy, friendly, and good with customers. 

The customers are friendly and every visit is enhanced by the clientele. 

I, personally,  enjoy the Chef and Cobb salads. The salads are an enjoyable and filling meal.

The business has a check in system for which points are accumulated and redeemed for food and/or drinks.  

All in all, one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Would be less if I could. Went for lunch today and did not feel welcome at all. Regulars taken care of, strangers not so much. Took a while to get a drink and never provided a menu or an option. No second chance for a first impression.  If this is their MO they are doomed! So I left.  There are too many alternatives in the area to put up with this treatment."}
{"text":"This place was formerly known as the Zen Cafe, where our group meet up about once a month to catch each other up. Went there last night and found that the new owners were very welcoming to our party of 13. Food was superb. I had the traditional pasta dinner made with asparagus,  chicken & mushrooms simmered in a sherry wine with long egg noodles. Needless to say, I couldn't finish it but will have an excellent lunch another day. Staff was friendly and courteous.  Not a fancy place but the prices are good."}
{"text":"Been excited to try this place and figured some of the reviews were growing pains, but in my book it was just ok.  Food wasn't anything special, not bad just adequate.   Another couple came in after us and no one even acknowledged them.   They were patient and waited for at least 20 minutes and finally walked out the door.     I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Such potential but horribly mismanaged !  We went there for brunch after church. Hostess told us 1.5 hour wait despite only 3 groups of 4 waiting. We decided to wait but many other people left after hearing the wait time. 

After 15 minutes we were seated. The service was great. Jennifer was the best, very positive attitude and very helpful. The food was pretty good but as we sat we could see more and more people come in and leave. The hostess even told the bus person not to clean the dirty dishes off the table next to us because she did not want waiting guests to bug her for the table. We complained about the disgusting sight and the bus person agreed to at least clear the plates. We counted about 2 dozen people who did not stay despite empty tables and booths. 

Such potential but poorly managed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday when we were out on the bikes and pleasantly surprised that they had a $5 breakfast. The bar service is always quick and friendly but the food off the normal menu is hit or miss. The pretzel appetizer is great but it's hard to screw up a pretzel. The steak was tough and full of tendon and we sent ut back only to receive another tough steak full of tendon and this one very over cooked."}
{"text":"The Friday night fish fry really good. 
Service was a bit slow but that's understandable due to how packed it was. It's a great place if your 60+."}
{"text":"If your 70+ this is the spot for you! We were definitely the youngest couple here. Service here is very very slow. The bartender didn't know how to open a champagne bottle. Prices here are cheap which is great, but you get what you paid for. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I will not return or recommend this establishment. The new owner has no people skills and is very unprofessional. I have a service dog and was meeting with friends for lunch. Upon entering the restaurant I was rudely approached by this man telling me to leave with my service animal. He didn't approach in a courteous manner rather very threatening. I do know that many longtime customers will not be reterturning here. Very unfornuate, because we like support local businesses."}
{"text":"Just came from dinner there.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME
. 
Pros
They ALMOST got the d√©cor right. Close kinda like hey we tried but it was more expensive than we thought so we cut some corners at the end.

Cons
There is something that I know from being in the restaurant business almost 23 years that once you know you can not not know. Here it is. The prices on the menu are too low. A 17 dollar \"regular cut filet mignon\"...umm no thank you. Second, we decided to play it really safe on our first visit......even playing it safe no thank you. The prices on the menu dictate really really poor quality ingredients and it screamed Sysco Reliant crap...that may sound harsh but I know what I know. Next, EVERY item we tried had a spice in it that tasted like burnt wood smells. It really was over powering EVERYTHING. Soup, pasta, chicken and shrimp all were blasted with this spice that I can not put my finger on. Next, the staff looked like worn out Denny's waitresses. They were UNSIGHTLY. Next some guy that looked like a strung out Frankenstein delivered our food..I am not exaggerating. The food was delivered without ordered sides which NEVER came out and before the soup came out. I hope it gets better but there is ALOT of improvement across the board needed."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  Do not go to this restaurant unless you have time and and money to waste!  We were giving this place another chance after the first time when we were totally ignored at the door.  We ordered wings which were very good.  So we were feeling good about this second experience. ....ordered one of the specials...a chimichanga and I ordered something called chicken montrechet.  After waiting for 45 minutes, our food finally came.  Husband took one bite of chimichanga and literally had to spit it out.  The tortilla was so over deep fried that it was dark brown and hard.  The ground beef inside was black and inedible.  My chicken was okay but had to scrape the sauce off asit had broken and looked congealed and tasted awful.  We tried to get the waitresses attention so that we could send the chimichanga back but we could not get her attention for another twenty minutes.  So my husband sat there with no food while I ate my dry chicken breast and baked potato.  When she did show up, she apologized and my husband he just wanted their sky high sandwich to go ($8.00).  We left and when we got home, my husband was starving and wanted to eat his $8 sky high sandwich!  He opened it and took a bite only to discover that there was still the paper that comes between slices of cheese on the sandwich. Not only that but the sky high had two pieces of turkey and two pieces of swiss cheese (with paper) and a soggy smashed bun.  It was disgusting and so my husband did not eat that night!  Tried to call to speak to owner but neither owner turned up there that night.  Other than one other table that night, there was no one else in the restaurant other than all the senior citizens at the bar to watch the Cardinals game.  This place calls itself a bar and grill but I now know why it was almost empty on a game night. The food is awful, the service is sketchy and wait time is incredibly slow.  We will not go back and will warn everyone not to patronize this place. A couple had walked in while we were waitingfor our food and after waiting for about 15 minutes, they walked out. They don't know how lucky they were.  The owner of this place owns a place in Sun City called Royal Cafe, a breakfast and lunch place.  Maybe they need to stick to that!"}
{"text":"Great place for date night in the summer. Quiet affordable no wait. In the winter however the staff can't handle filled tables. Food takes forever to come out and people are constantly knocking into your chair."}
{"text":"All you can eat fish.  On Friday night!  Guess what? NOPE! Ran out of fish at 7:15.  Then they changed their mind after we complained and mystery fish appeared.  Manager  would not come over.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"What a great visit! I've been driving by this plaza for quite a long time now and an impromptu date night led us to finally give West End Bar & Grill a try. Boy am i glad we did! 

Nestled in a back corner of the lot behind Goodwill, it's definitely off the beaten track. You can't see it from the street, you have to pull in to the lot and head to the southeast corner of the back lot. And don't let the golf carts out front fool you--this place is BIG, FUN, and not just for the Geriatric crowd of Sun City West!

We enjoyed the wings for an appetizer. The wings were big and meaty with a nice crunchy coating.  I enjoyed the Veggie sandwich which was a portabello mushroom sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mixed greens on flat bread. It had a great pesto and balsamic dressing as well. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the special which was a taco salad with a FREE margarita or beer. He had the marg. The taco salad was just the right size, fresh, and plenty meaty. We also had dessert--a lemon bar sundae. Everything was really very good. 

Our server was friendly, interesting, and not intrusive at all. The other staff members were also friendly as well when they worked near our table, checking on us and removing plates as needed.  

I am really looking forward to going back to West End. This place is a diamond in the rough here in Surprise and supporting small, local businesses whenever possible is what I'm all about!"}
{"text":"Service is FreAKING slow !!!!! Had to wait to 15 min to order food.... Asked meanwhile for extra napkins..... Waitress was more worry  to check out bills than bringing napkins..... so, I took silverware from dif table.....  Service bad, food is better than Zen cafe used to be....."}
{"text":"Don't go for breakfast at West End!!  Their Eggs Benedict came with hard boiled poached eggs and their hollandaise is Bland, Bland, Bland!  The biscuits and gravy were horrible!  I always thought that the gravy was supposed to be a sausage gravy, but it's just a PLAIN old white sauce!  Their biscuits are dry and heavy.  On the bright side they do now how to cook an over-easy egg.....  Our server was dull and invisible!  She never showed up to ask how everything was.... and then made the \"gracious\" offer to remove our drinks from the bill to compensate for a terrible meal!!  WHERE CAN YOU GET A GOOD BREAKFAST IN SURPRISE???????????????"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Food was great and the price was right. Spread the word there's a new place to eat in Surprise.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"They did a great redesign of the inside. This used to be Native New Yorker quite a while ago and couple of places in between. Definitely worth the time to find. 

The breakfast selection is limited but that might be along of the lines of they don't do a lot but what they do, they do very well. 

We tried the Stuffed French Toast, Chaquillias and the Eggs Tuscano. I have to say everything was very, very good. The flavors are great and the prices were fair at $7 a plate. Good size portions too.

My only suggestion/complaint is the hostess needs to be much more aware and welcome people as they come in. Lots of attention needed there. 

Service was good and the waitress was very friendly. It was busy so food did take a while but worth the wait. 

It is near Sun City West so it was definitely an older crowd. 

We will be back to try the lunch and dinner menu and most definitely return for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wings were the perfect size, but the Buffalo sauce was bland, and the wings were greasy. Great atmosphere, hip decor, but the country music was a total turnoff. Clientele was 60+, but where else in the far west end of Grand Ave can you get 3 beers and wings for under $20? Please tell me- I'd rather be there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Service was quick and friendly. I would suggest cleaning tables off with soap and water as they were sticky.  The men's room could also use a good cleaning, not just the tops of items. 
Good prices on the menu and good food."}
{"text":"Under new management great owners awesome staff friendly service!! Good things are going to happen!!! Going to be a great hangout place!! Great specials awesome prices.. Open for breakfast lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"NOTHING FANCY...JUST PLAIN GOOD FOOD.
Just had breakfast.   Service was quick and outstanding.  Can't believe how fast our food came.
Nothing fancy but just plain good.  And reasonably priced.  Off the beaten path...but worth the extra trouble to get to.  Thanks West End.  YOU DONE GOOOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because I saw the good reviews. I dont know what these people were smoking. I went in on a Friday night and had the worst fish and chips I ever had. The order was ready the second the server put it in. So you know it was just sitting there. Rubbery fish cold fries. Slaw was warm. The service was horrible. I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time.  We had a GREAT waitress... Erin!   The food was amazing, three classic burgers and one club salad at our table!

The beer was cold, but not served in frosted mugs (-1 point)!!   Y'all need to fix that!!

Burgers were very tasty, and 1/2 pound Angus beef!!

We'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"West End is under NEW ownership!! Stop in and meet them and share in all the exciting things happening! They are talking about a more country theme complete with line dance lessons! Throw on your cowboy boots and come say hi to the awesome staff. Grab a bite to eat and when the menu changes come grab another taste!"}
{"text":"Four of us went there on a Friday night.  We had fish, shrimp pasta, crab cake sandwich and a hamburger.  Not only was the food horrible (we sent back pasta and could not eat the crab cake..was VERY fishy).  The service was terrible.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"Large, well decorated in a basic modern theme and clean--I love the decor.
The food was great with no complaints (Friday night fish), the price was right and the service was very good.
Went a long time ago (sorry, but I forgot to write a Yelp review then) for a birthday party soon after they opened, but all my memories of this place are positive."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Rather quiet for a place that shows.... SPORTSBALL!!!   I'm good with that.  Good happy hour.  Fair prices.  Food was ok. Could have used a little more flavor, but not bad overall.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for our second visit. Both tonight and the first time for the Friday night fish fry. Both times we had to wait over a half hour for our food. You would think if the special is the fish that it would come promptly. How could it take so long when that's what everyone comes for? Anyway, the first time (last fall) the fish was decent, so almost worth the wait. Tonight the fish was terrible, like it was fried in motor oil. Someone else at our table thought  the oil tasted like cigarettes. Overly thick coating. Fries and coleslaw were just okay. Our waitress tried to compensate with friendly service but it wasn't enough. Would not go back here again. I wish I could give this zero stars."}
{"text":"I only gave West End two stars because the happy hour drink prices were ok. Decided to walk there one day with our puppy and sit outside in the gazebo but the stench of the unemptied cigarette butts in the many cans sitting everywhere was unbareable! Having previous experience in the bar business it seemed inexcusable to not have the space properly cleaned for all to enjoy. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a side of Mac n cheese for an appetizer. We both ordered fish since it was Friday, with side salads. We also asked for a cup of the soup of the day- clam chowder. The salads came out first, then 2 minutes later the soup arrived. 1 minute later the Mac and cheese arrived. We joked that the word \"appetizer\" seems to be beyond most servers. We had a few bites of our salad and our entrees arrived. Are you kidding me? We had so many plates on our table the waiter made a joke about it. I just looked at him like \"are you punking me\". To top this off 3 different servers seemed to be our servers plus the food runners. We had to ask several for refills of water. We also had to grab someone for salt/pepper and to just get our bill. They were all super friendly but it's super clear there is no leadership or management guiding them. The deco is great, the food was all good. We will try one more time, I always give local places a second try. These service issues must be addressed. Any pos system should allow a server to time when food comes out. Clearly there is a miscommunication between the servers and cooks, this is a management issue."}
{"text":"Zack, James, Amanda and Garrett are amazing!!! So attentive and get your orders right. Loved the service. Amazing vodka available."}
{"text":"Walked in with my wife and we were the youngest ones their amidst senior citizens and decided to leave.  So I have no idea what the food or service is like."}
{"text":"If your wanting a bloody mary before 10am go to Fuzzys. They refused to make us a drink before then."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed dinner, drinks and dessert. All I can say is \"It was terrific.\" Fresh, flavorful and nicely presented. Great service."}
{"text":"After carding my boyfriend and I for mimosas, the server took our IDs and walked to the back and inspected them for like 5 minutes with two other workers...the girl returned and said it took so long because they don't usually have to card anyone so they don't really know how to...weird. Then it took about 15 minutes and 3 employees to open a bottle of champagne for the mimosas. Eggs Benedict was good for the price...only $7.00! The \"chicken soup\" was okay tasting, but it was made with beef, not chicken."}
{"text":"Just the average bar. Nothing special. Might visit again and try something other then a burger."}
