{"text":"This place is a gem. Their sandwiches, pastries, cookies, and pretty much everything is delicious. What makes it better is that it is very affordable. Perfect to grab a quick bite during the day or a quick lunch. 

This place needs more reviews!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet. I'm suspecting that it's the kind of place the locals want to keep a secret. Hugely popular and busy, Dispensa Cafe has been my go to coffee place since I moved into the neighbourhood this year. 

First off, it's an authentic Italian grocery/bakery/coffee shop/lunch to go establishment. The place is pretty small so it's the kind of place you get stuff to go. 

Man is their food fresh and high quality. Aside from a range of espresso drinks, they also have baked goods and prepared lunches, all prepared fresh daily! The best part is despite it being located in Old Montreal, it's actually pretty inexpensive. I regularly enjoy their $3 pastries, $2.75 lattes, and $5 veal lunches. 

As I've said earlier, the place is Italian. I'm not Italian myself but it seems pretty legit to me. The store also happens to be an mini Italian grocery. They've got a selection of pastas, sauces, oils, chocolates, cookies, cheeses, cold cuts, and drinks; mostly brands I've never seen at a regular grocery store. 

If you're in the neighbourhood and am in the mood for some good food and coffee take out I highly recommend you try this spot!"}
{"text":"Some of the nicest people to ever own a coffee shop in the old port. Inexpensive, tasty espressos and milk based drinks, they also have great, cheap sandwiches and pre-made lunches, I think they have the most inexpensive lunches around that area. 

They also have a small but solid cold cuts, cheese and dairy, and pastries section, and a small grocery store for the people who lives near there.

One of the coolest find I've been to in the entire vicinity of downtown."}
{"text":"Great, super cheap place to grab lunch from! Their selection varies but their sandwiches and calzones are generally good and you can't beat the price and how nice the people who work there are. They always have smiles on their faces. It's also a little Italian market so you can buy a bunch of assorted Italian things. I don't drink the coffee, but I've heard it's solid."}
{"text":"I go there about once a week and the place gets absolutely swarmed at lunch time.  It's a very tiny counter but pretty much everything coming out of that kitchen is fabulous.  Their big thing is the porchetta sandwich, which is heavenly.  The salads and the pastries are delicious, service is fast and the prices are really honest.

Hopefully this place stays the same!"}
