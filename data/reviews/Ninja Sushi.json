{"text":"Americanized \"Japanese food\" with plenty of sushi rolls being offered - if you like your sushi rolls with a mayo based sauce, fried item of some sort, imitation crab, with a bit of avocado, this is the place for you.  On the expensive end - won't be back."}
{"text":"They are used to be good.  Portion, rice, food quality are extemely bad"}
{"text":"Chirashi don is pretty good. Sashimi tasted pretty fresh. Their tempera is not very crunchy but still pretty tasty. 

California roll is average."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI.  And Ninja sushi is my new favorite sushi spot.  They use top quality fish.  I havent tried anything I didnt love yet.  Nice atmosphere, great food, good service.  What more can you ask for?  They have a huge selection of creative rolls.  Worth a trip to try some killer sushi.   ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was sorta cute inside I guess but when I go somewhere to get japanese food I expect it to be light & refreshing but ninja sushi was the exact opposite! The sushi mainly tasted of mayo & was fried..when I order even a Cali roll I think of crab,avocado, & carrot but it was all mixed up with mayo & edamame had table salt instead of sea salt, the chicken I got was all dark meat & sorta fatty, salad was iceberg lettuce& had basic ranch dressing not a nice japaneese dressing,  the \"baked shrimp\" appetizer was swimming in grease & obviously fried & To top it all off we had little yellow flowers on our plate for presentation & the flower came from the bushes right outside the restaurant...defiantly won't ever waste my money there! In my opinion a japanese restaurant should offer something thats different than all others like it because there's so many of them within walking distance & the only thing different ninja offers is that it's worse than any I've ever tried"}
{"text":"I've had sushi from dozens of different chefs. This place is hands down the best. Chef is obviously highly trained. Perfect rice to fish ratio. Super fresh. Perfect consistency. Very good value as well. Hope you live or work close as you will be back regularly."}
{"text":"I always refer to yelp reviews when picking a place to eat, but I've never written one until now so bear with me. 

We're always looking for great sushi places near the house so we were very excited to try this place out as it is around the corner from our house. 

The decor is cute, especially considering that this restaurant sits in a strip mall with a Fry's grocery store around the corner. One look at the menu, however, and it seemed extremely pricey for a restaurant in a strip mall next to a Fry's. I'd expect prices like this at a swanky place in Scottsdale. We tried to be open minded hoping the prices would be justified by awesome sushi. 

The menu is HUGE with pages and pages of special sushi roll options and there is no sheet to write down what you're selecting. The waitress takes your order. We ended up writing down what we wanted on a napkin so we could order without forgetting what we wanted once the waitress came around. The waitress seemed nice enough but knew very little about sushi. We got a blank stare when we asked her about their sashimi and she had to ask someone if they even offered it and where it could be found on the menu. What sushi restaurant doesn't offer sashimi? The rolls were HUGE. By huge I mean a small piece of fish wrapped around a giant fist full of rice. The chefs are also very liberal with the sauces they use. TOO liberal. All you taste is white rice and sauce. One of our sushi rolls had lemon in it and they didn't even bother to take the seeds out. Imagine biting into a 13 dollar sushi roll with lemon seed. If you're into Americanized sushi, aren't into raw fish, and have a fat wallet, this is your place. If you enjoy sushi for the simplicity and flavor of the fish, you'll be disappointed. 

In short, this place was overpriced and served over-sauced, overly-Americanized sushi.  We should have gone to Sushi Eye."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 9/10

A very snug spot for some inexpensive yet delicious high quality sushi. The ingredients we're very fresh and everything tasted wonderful! I had a sushi and sashimi boat and the fish was fresh AF and was at the perfect temperature slightly colder than room temperature. Rice was well seasoned and the proportion of fish and toppings to rice was reasonable and balanced. 

It is a very small place and only has two sit down tables of two, and a counter strip that can seat around four people. 

The staff and chefs were very friendly and provided very responsive service seen in welcoming us, taking our order, and bringing out food and appetizers. 

Also seems like a very takeout-friendly place from seeing numerous walk-in orders made during my sit down stay for dinner. Not the fanciest place but definitely a place I would reach a few times a week to get my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Theres only 3 reviews here so I thought I put down my views since I'm a regular here.  Some background, I've eaten at AYCE (All you can eat) sushi places and regular sushi restaurants --- so I'm very particular about taste, texture and smell.

Like another reviewer, I've been eating here since it was known as Hokkai Ya -- in fact I ate there roughly 5-6 years during that time.   And any friend I brought here was instantly hooked.  The owner of Hokkai Ya sold it to second owners that changed the name to Ninja Sushi.     Went there twice and it was horrible, keep reading.

A few years had passed so I thought I'd give it another try and found that 3rd owners have taken over.  Thankfully they did and are still there, they have restored this sushi place to its former glory.

Firstly let me just say this is a mom & pop kind of sushi place they only have two 2-seater tables, 3-seater if your friends don't mind a crowded table .... and a sushi bar.  They also do takeout, but no delivery unfortunately.

The fish quality for this one sushi place has always been spectacular, salmon that is my favorite has always had a great flavor and texture here.   The rice for sushi is perfect, good temperature not cold like some inexperienced places.  

They automatically put a bead of wasabi under each sushi fish until I requested they don't do so cause I like to taste the flavors of the fish and my buddy does the wasabi and soy sauce mix.

If you sit down and eat in they also offer you seaweed salad, miso soup and barley tea which is a very nice treat.

The prices are amazing I'm willing to say this is the best sushi place in York Region, and also because the quality is above average I'd say a solid 8/10.

The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars, is because I've had sushi at a sushi restaurant that gets all their fish from Japan and that was amazing --- but it was a tasters meal and paid hefty for it.    

The only reason why I keep coming back year after year is because although quaint and charming in its small size its a damn good sushi period.

They also do fried items now such as tempura (amazing) , dragon rolls and their gyoza (Japanese Dumplings) are crazy addictive..

UPDATE: 
October 5, 2013 -- Still going here and still great sushi, I like finishing off a sushi/sashimi platter (with a friend of course) with Salmon Sushi Hand roll, its delish.   

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion (sometimes thats the issue).  If you're going to bash this place, at the very least say why you don't like it.  Saying stuff like average Japanese restaurant or something like that, then compared to what alternative?   

Some people just love complaining or think their gods gift to everyone.  Always look at that persons other reviews either they hate every place they try or they love every place.  That will give you a sense of how they gauge reviewing.  I tend to just review good food spots, cause lets face it people check yelp to see where they're eating next.    I prefer objective reviews and I try giving the best objective review I can....I hate this because...I like this because..."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise. We went on a whim on a Saturday night and didn't expect that much with a name like Ninja Sushi. All the food we had was excellent. The Sari's Special Roll was eight large pieces for about $13 and was quite good. I don't recall everything in it, but there was deep fried shrimp, red snapper, spicy tuna and other items in it. The endamame was good, if a little hard to extract from the pod. For entrees we had the Korean Style BBQ Short Ribs and they were amazing. I'm still thinking about them. Perfectly prepared and seasoned and accompanied by white rice and a salad.  Someone else complained about the salad dressing, but my wife and I loved it. Would probably ask for it on the side next time because it was a little overdressed. We also had the Combination Tempura and it was good as well. It included shrimp, potato, carrot, asparagus and cauliflower. All were good, but the asparagus was a bit wooden. The only thing preventing me from giving this five stars is the bar area needs a little work. No one knew how to make a vodka martini and we ordered Zin off of their wine list, but they were out. This was minor though as I just had a vodka rocks and we ordered a pinot. The staff is outstanding and was apologetic about the bar issue.  We were impressed as to the appearance of the restaurant as the bar is nice and roomy, both the alcohol bar and the sushi bar. Also a good number of tables and booths. I second what a prior reviewer mentioned that this is the Bermuda Triangle of restaurant locations. Nothing seems to stick here very long. Let's hope Ninja Sushi reverses that trend."}
{"text":"First visit
Great quality sushi. Had a sushi lunch special, 1 roll 1/2 and 1/2 plus 3pc nigiri $10.95. Great attention to detail in sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was good  ,sorta pricey if you don't catch happy hour . No liquor License yet would be my only real complaint . I would only come here during happy hour because like i said its good but i have had better for cheaper ."}
{"text":"Quick takeout spot. It is a small restaurant, there are seats but doesn't look too comfy. Aside from parking being a bit inconvenience, paying cash you get 15% off. I called ahead to pick up. Quick service, approximately 20m, by the time I arrive they just finished. Quality isn't bad for the price. Sashimi is quite fresh, sushi is flavorful and pretty big and filling. Not big in sense of rice but the ingredients in the maki is in good amount. The maki came with small party tray was California roll and a shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura is fresh, crispy batter, and shrimp itself was very tasty. I ordered a spicy salmon maki on side. And I have yet find another spicy salmon maki taste as good as this one. Just right spiciness, and not oily. They were generous and given me a salmon maki as well after I went home and opened the box. I'd come back If I'm around the area for a quick takeout."}
{"text":"Affordable and friendly. Place is cozy. Nothing spectacular, but will suffice for a casual meal. This place offers takeout, and if you dine-in, you get complimentary salad and miso soup.
Their card machine runs on a telephone line, so it is significantly slower than what you're accustomed to.
They are also very accommodating. Came in late one time, they had everything packed up and ready to close. Instead of telling us to leave, they quickly set up everything again. Felt really bad, but their service deserves recognition."}
{"text":"Big portion, own by Korean couple. Small place which only got two tables. Food are okay but the sashimi not servers as a piece, only half piece... love the rice."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a sushi connoisseur, so most of the time, sushi is just sushi to me. As far as I'm concerned, the sushi here is pretty good.

We ordered the Spider Roll, S.T.A. Roll, Crispy Spicy Salmon, and Ninja Sashimi Combo. Perhaps they've changed it up, but unlike a previous review, the softshell crab in the Spider Roll was crispy. The other rolls were a regular amount of enjoyable. 

Serving three people for about $41 with decent sushi, I have no complaints. They told me to be careful while taking the sushi out so that the tobiko wouldn't toppled over, which I found charming because it conveyed that they cared. 

I wouldn't say the food is travel-out-of-your-way worthy, but if you're nearby and feel like having sushi, I think you could trust this place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight after this place has been open about a month. First impressions were very good. Warm greeting when we entered. We decided to sit at Sushi Bar and had a friendly sushi chef that was very eager to please. The menu is very large with a lot of custom rolls not found anywhere else. The choices re cool but also a little much to digest. The sushi chef recognized this and asked what fish we like best. After we replied, he suggested a \"Special Roll\" and it was awesome. Very good flavor and fresh. The service was VERY attentive, almost too much so. The staff works in teams and is very aware. I was asked three times in two minutes by three people if I wanted a drink refill. Too me, i like having too many requests than none at all. Overall, nice place we will go regularly."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars for the consistent quality of food and service. 

This little sushi joint is more suitable for take- out than for dine-in, and has been around for more than 2 decades (there must be a reason why).

Great place to pick up a party platter or a pound of salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurant in the GTA. Food is always excellent yet still very affordable. 
An always go to for takeout!!"}
{"text":"We are not heavy sushi eaters but ninja has changed that.  Their rolls are so good.  Service is terrific, they changed the tv so we could watch our team.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It's located in Bamburgh circle Plaza.  This is my third time here as I live very close in walking distance.   I read good reviews on here so I keep coming back to give it another chance. 

Got take out today, nobody else was there, decided to order 3 rolls.  Ninja roll (spicy tuna, avocado, tobiko)(5.95) spider roll (10.95), and salmon skin roll (3.95). It took 15 minutes for the rolls to get prepared. 

When first opening the box they were nicely placed with neat presentation. The spider roll was big, rolled in tempura bits. When taking the first bite, it was a little disappointed as the tempura flakes were stale, the soft shell crab was warm and crispy. 

The salmon skin roll contained a lot of rice and thin layer of salmon skin and some cucumbers.  It was warm and freshly cooked, but the ratio to rice was about 70% rice and 30% filling. 

The ninja roll was a little disappointing too.  I ate the tobiko first and noticed once again 70% rice and very little filling.  They used the tobiko to cover the lack of filling so it wouldn't be noticed if you eat it in one bite. 

Some ayce Japanese restaurants provide way more filling than here. 

Including taxes, it cost $24 for 3 rolls, I thought it was pricey considering the number of Japanese restaurants and higher quality in the area.  

I don't think I will come here again."}
{"text":"Ninja sushi is a small Japanese restaurant located at the corner of the Bamburgh Plaza. My sister and I ordered this giant sushi platter from here as we were craving sushi and wanted an assortment of sushi rolls. Make sure you order it advance as they are a small restaurant and it takes them time to prepare the sushi platters. They offer a la carte at the restaurant in addition to the party trays. For this medium sushi platter, it was about $60 for 72 pcs with sushi, sashimi and maki rolls. Visually it looks very presentable on a platter. The sushi, sashimi and rolls were quite good for a sushi platter. There were a nice variety and a bit of everything. Everything was simply delicious and tasted great! I especially loved the tempura rolls. The sashimi was nicely cut and quite good. It was nice and freshly prepared when we arrived to pick it up. Overall, loved the sushi platter and would definitely come to order again! Highly recommend coming here for your sushi fix and definitely consider their party trays when you host a big gathering!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant. Good food, fair price. But limited seats, good for take-out orders."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of my friend, we came to dine-in here for lunch and what a mistake that was...

I yelped the restaurant prior to going and quickly fell in love with the pictures and reviews of this place. I was excited!! Once arriving, this place was SMMMMMAAAAALLLLL. There were only 6 chairs in total, 2 tables, and one bar-sitting area. Also, I noticed on the dine-in menu that I had to pay an extra $1 for eating at the restaurant and there was a time limit of an hour. Seriously? When you get two women together, you know lunch is going to be more than an hour long with all the talking/gossip/catching-up that we're going to be doing. 

Thankfully, we were the only two dining-in the entire time and the restaurant didn't get busy at all. We probably stayed there for close to 2 hours before the owner told us that our time limit was up and we had to leave.

Food-wise, I ordered the bento box that came with 3 pieces salmon sushi, 6 pieces california roll, 2 shrimp tempura, 2 yam tempura, and salad. The sushi pieces were alright, typical sushi that you'd get elsewhere, nothing spectacular. The shrimp tempura had a thick batter... I wasn't crazy about it. The yam tempura, let me tell you, it is not yam, as in the orange sweet potato; the yam tempura was yellow in the inside and again, I was not a fan of that batter. The salad was just weird; I couldn't quite figure the dressing that was on top of the shredded cabbage... I am thinking it tasted like caesar but it is weird that a sushi place would use caesar dressing. Overall, it was a meeehh bento box, I was hungry so I ate it all but I probably wouldn't recommend ordering it.

Overall, would I return? Maybe... the sushi here was fresh, but I will most definitely opt for the take-out to save not only $1 charge but also the tips."}
{"text":"Decent little sushi place. Very small inside so not ideal for dine in. Take away is ok though.  Sushi and sashimi was fresh. Not the best or worst sushi place but ok enough to fulfill joke sushi cravings.
Pricing was pretty good for the party tray. I got the small one for about $37.
Don't think I will order from here again as there are better take away sushi restaurants around."}
{"text":"This place is very conveniently located ( for me ), the owners are nice people and the food is tasty. Yes, you could probably get cheaper elsewhere ( as other reviews suggest ) but I think the food is good value for the quality!"}
{"text":"Beware, Ninja sushi is small. It has two tables and dining in costs an extra dollar, which I assume is to encourage take outs more.

I had a small sashimi and sushi boat. The boat consisted mostly of salmon and tuna. The salmon was very decent and fresh. The rolls in the boat were on the larger side, and the sushi were very filling due to a generous amount of rice underneath.

The place is nothing fancy. Quite rundown from the outside, in fact. However, if you want decent, quick sushi, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is a small sushi place that has been around the Bamburgh circle plaza for many years.
It is right across from Sam Woo restaurant and situated beside Pizza Nova.
I ordered a large party tray with a combination of sushi, sashimi, and maki. 
It comes with 122 pieces (34 pc sushi, 40 pc sashimi, and 48 pc makis) with a price of about $93 before taxes, $105 after tax. 
I had ordered for takeout with a pickup at 6pm and made the call in the morning. 
The food was made on time and it was a quick drop in. 
The owners are very friendly and they were very generous with the amount of condiments/utensils they provided us.
I thought the food tasted great as everything was fresh and there was a wide variety of selection!
I counted the pieces..yes, I'm that kind of person..and the tray definitely had more than 122+ pieces, which was a plus! 
This place is more for takeout/catering as there are only about 2-3 tables for dining in, fit for about 7-10 people in total. 
Highly recommended and worth a try!"}
{"text":"This has always been my family's go to for sushi when we need food for a big group. This place is for takeout - there are a few seats though. Every time we order they've been on time and efficient. The pricing is quite reasonable.

The rolls are always well made - fresh ingredients and well portioned. The most recent time didn't meet my expectations though. After training myself for the past few years I can finally eat and enjoy raw fish - the first thing I noticed was the odd pale color of the salmon sushi. The slices of fish were quite thin and both the salmon and tuna weren't very flavourful. Perhaps their sashimi is better. The rolls were okay too - good but nothing mind blowing. My mom commented that the avocado wasn't ripe enough. 

The food wasn't bad. I might look for something better though! Presentation was beautiful."}
{"text":"If you're craving for sushi, this is the place to go! Good quality and value. They also include complimentary rolls. Very nice owners. :)"}
{"text":"Very small place. Literally two tables and seats in front of the chef. Ordered green dragon and red dragon (no fish eggs), and tempura (4 shrimp + 4 yam). Tempura was more on the breaded side (I prefer panko flakes). Rolls came with fish eggs, but were decent size. Avocado tasted fresh. Red dragon texture was too soft/moist/mushy.

Would I go back? Probably not. Definitely not for tempura."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times since it opened a few months back. Each time, the sushi was fresh and the portions were huge. They have a menu so large that it's difficult to make a decision (and that's not a bad thing)! It's a tad bit pricey but they recently started a happy hour special where you buy 2 rolls and get the 3rd for free. The only problem is that the happy hour only goes until 6pm. I'd like to see it end at 7 instead. The owners are always very friendly and come to the tables to check on everything a few times. The service is typically good but there is one server that I've had the last 2 vists who seems very \"spaced out\" and acts as if it's her first day on the job each time. Not a huge issue but just a little annoying. Overall, I'd highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was decent. Not really filling but the service was nice and quick and made when I've arrived to pick it up. Some rolls were just the size of a loonie which was disappointing"}
{"text":"I walk through the door of a location that is not unlike the bermuda triangle, swallowing up and business that gets its foot in the door. My first thought was deja-vu of course, but after I got through that I noticed the decor.

The place I would describe as nice, sleek, hip, and decorated with rich, dark colors. The bar has beautiful countertops, also very dark in color. There also seemed to be somewhat of a steel  theme near the bar area, mainly the area parallel to where customers dangle their legs.

Ninja Sushi can probably seat about 60-75 people comfortably. There were 4 tables seated when my family arrived at 5:30 pm on a Friday (their 1st day open by the way). 

The food? Top notch. Some of the best sushi I've eaten. i can't believe you can buy a California roll for $4.95. We also got a Bubble Bubble roll (even better) for $7.95. Average price for a roll there averages $12, and entrees were about $13-14. 

Negatives: it took awhile for our food to arrive. You'd think a newly-opening restaurant with not a bunch of customers would try and woo their first ones with getting the food out quickly. Of course we had our baby with us and perhaps the chefs were getting used to the menu, so perhaps we were a little impatient.

No desserts! What?! Very odd, we were ready to order. The waitress didn't know much, but I got the feeling they may get desserts, but they were not available nor were they on the menu.

All things considered, mostly food quality and price, I give it a thumbs up and will be happy to recommend such a fine Chandler establishment"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've ever had. Service is always great! Sushi is always amazing! I go here very often and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We tried Ninja Sushi a few weeks ago and I have to say I was very pleased with the atmosphere, the food, and the service.  

My daughter and I came in on a Friday late afternoon/early evening so they were not too busy yet.  We were greeted and opted to sit at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs were all so nice and eager to help us.  My daughter loved watching them and they even prepared some beautiful pieces for her.  She was delighted.  She loves shrimp and was very pleased that there was an appitizer of popcorn shrimp on the menu.  She loved it and with a bowl of rice she was a happy camper.  I had a Dragon Roll which was delicious.  They have an extensive menu and seemed willing to make anything to order.  Having never traveled to Japan I wouldn't know if this is \"authentic\" versus \"americanized\".  I frequented several sushi spots in Northern California and this is on par with those I've tried before.  

The service was very pleasant and we were checked on several times to make sure everything was to our liking.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere.  There are several booths and a nice bar along with the sushi bar.  It's decorated in dark colors with a cozy feeling.  The only thing I thought awkward was the space, or lack of, right when you walk in the door.  The register in there and then it seems as though you are right on top of the tables.  I would imagine this would be a problem if they were very busy.  There seemed to be no waiting area.  

I am pleased to have a good sushi spot close to home and we will return! They also run lunch specials so I will be trying them for lunch soon."}
{"text":"The spider roll is huge, good enough for two people.  
Love the hand roll, it is big too.  good for take out, and the price is great too"}
{"text":"This place is really small tucked in the corner of bamburgh circle. The restaurant itself is really small and is pretty much good for takeout. I wouldn't say their fish is the best, but it's pretty decent if you're looking for sushi, pretty above average. 

Japanese restaurants are really dependent on if they're fish is fresh or not, and this place has fresh fish, but not necessarily the best cuts. The salmon pieces are a bit lean which caused it to lack flavour. The shrimps also lack that sweet flavouring, tasted like any boiled shrimp. 

I ordered their sashimi party trays a few times and haven't been disappointed yet, they are quite generous with their portions and they put a lot more salmon then other fishes. The price is on point and you get what you pay for. Their chirashi is a little bit expensive and not really worth it imo. Haven't tried their rolls yet but based on menu and photos, they are just normal sushi rolls you'd find at any restaurant, not really unique so I never tend to order it.

Service wise they are very quick and efficient, when I order for pick up they are ready around 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here 2 days ago. Got there for the Happy Hour and was pleasantly surprised that my beer cost $1.  Happy Hour is from 3-6pm and a great value.  The special offer for sushi rolls - 3 rolls for price of 2.  These are all specialty rolls. The sushi was fresh and the service is excellent. Met the owner Moon who is a delightful person. We are definitely going back and plan to be \"regulars\"!"}
{"text":"Had my usual dishes there recently (twice in fact), but since changing owners the quality of the food went down dramatically. So much so that this is no longer my default Japanese restaurant. That title went back to my really old default: Sashimi House.

The Chirashi Don though more packed than other places, but it was packed mostly with rice. The rice was mediocre, sort of the same thing you can get with the microwave rice cooker rather than the soft Japanese rice. The quality of the fish is so so for the price you pay for as well. 

The soft shell crab roll also needed a lot of work. It had too much rice and the crab was pretty mushy rather than crispy. 

It's too bad that the quality went down so much. I really liked the two previous owners since it was called Hokkai Ya, but change happens and hopefully it would change back, but I am not putting my money on to find out."}
{"text":"Had a great sushi experience at Ninja Sushi. The food was great. Only 4 stars because they need a happy hour and a few more lunch choices."}
{"text":"Another great sushi place out here in the middle of the desert. How they do it, I'll never know - but it's tasty just the same. My only complaint was the non-sushi items were a bit pricey. I got a \"seafood salad\" which was $10, and it included a handful of lettuce, an imitation crab stick, and two thin pieces of octopus. Similarly, the squid salad was somewhere in the $10-$13 range, which is waaaay more than places like Mikado and Sushi-Eye. 

BUT, they're a new joint and it's very good food. I loved my double dragon roll, so maybe in time the prices will come down and we'll be going back. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   It's not an amazing place... but for the price it's worth it.   I've been going for a number of years to the previous place (Hokkai Ya) and don't think the quality has gone down that much... as stated in other reviews here.   

Don't go expecting awesome stuff..  it's good though.   The quality of the fish & rolls are above most sushi restaurants."}
