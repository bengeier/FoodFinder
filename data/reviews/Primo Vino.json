{"text":"Charming little spot, yummy food--the salads are chilled!--and terrific service. They did a super job with a large group. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"There are plenty of great restaurants in Little Italy, but this is not one... The clear view of the kitchen gives way to the microwave, which is used frequently to reheat old dishes. I personally prefer restaurants that make their food on the stove and hold themselves to a higher standard. The food is lack luster as demonstrated by the use of microwaves. But, if you are looking for just a nice small iceberg lettuce salad with a couple olives, it may be to your liking."}
{"text":"This place may have a lot of Italian panache but there's one thing they have that you won't find in Italy: the Leaning Tower of Microwaves.  I'd like to say something nice about this Italian basement-job but if a place doesn't have the respect to offer its customers a fresh meal (especially at their prices) then I just can't do it.  It should have been obvious to me and my friends when every other restaurant on the Little Italy strip had a 45 minute wait while this place was dead-empty.  We decided to give it a chance anyway, mostly because they were showing the Lions-Patriots pre-season game on the little TV behind the bar.  From our vantage point we were able to get a clear view right into the \"kitchen.\"  My friend pointed out that there were a couple stacks of microwaves and we contemplated bailing on the place right then but I assured everyone that the presence of a microwave does not automatically mean every meal is going to run through it.  Boy was I wrong.  We observed the \"chef\" carefully selecting items from the oversized refigerator alongside the bar.  Order after order received a generous ladle-ful of his thin red sauce and was then tossed into one of the many microwaves.  When our food was delivered we were all given the warning: \"Be careful.  The plate is very hot.\"  Thanks for the tip.  One of my friends took one bite and promptly walked out to go across the street for a coffee and a pastry, his appetite wholly destroyed.  None of the rest of us were able to stomach much and we all left our plates full.  When a server asked why we didn't eat anything and didn't want to take it home we told her it was because it tasted like it was microwaved.  She gave us an understanding look and told us she was sorry.  I highly recommend staying away from this place unless you want to know what it's like to appear in the first 15 minutes of a Kitchen Nightmares episode."}
{"text":"Should have known when all other places on the street were packed this place was empty. Their sauce was simply awful, not much more than ketchup. The veal was tough and chewy, the egg plant was a mushy mess. I think a step up would be Ragu. Also there was hardly any cheese on either dish.  Avoid this place at all cost, better off going to Fazolis."}
{"text":"Still tasty! Went again during the Feast of the Assumption with family and were impressed the by price, offerings, and homemade quality. No fancy stuff here, just good italian basics served by nice folks. Makes me sad they more folks don't go here."}
{"text":"I must have had a little bad luck. I realize most of the reviews are primo. I didn't have such an experience.   First of all, when I walked in (and down the stairs into this cavern-like place), it smelled like a blend of mothballs and 1954. Fake flowers (fake poinsettias to be precise, in late February) sat on the table. Other assorted kitsch was all around. And I don't think it was ironic kitsch (cf. Melt).   I wanted a beer to start with. Since their list wasn't long, I assumed they were on tap. Nope, just bottles. And they were out of whatever I wanted. The wine list, to be fair, is a little longer.   My party was really hungry and let down by the results of a trial earlier that day. We wanted to have a nice experience.   Meh.   We hoped to have some of the bread other yelpers have talked about. It was cold white bread with a few sesame seeds. The oil on the table was canola oil, not olive oil. So that was obviously rather gross.   Having noticed things weren't going well, and since the lone server was dealing with a larger party, I just resigned myself to having an appetizer. Some kind of mozzarella stuffed with something. I couldn't tell what it was. It was okay, with way too much lettuce for \"garnish.\"  From the people who had proper dinner, the portions looked generous. No one made much comment either way as far as the food is concerned, so I figured it must be fairly mediocre."}
{"text":"Good, solid and traditional Italian cuisine here. I've been coming to this location every time I'm in the Cleveland area since it was Rocky Marciano's Italia. Very reliable."}
{"text":"the dandelion salad is great.  The dandelion is a bit heavy but they told us about that, the dressing was fabulous! I really enjoyed it.  The Cesar salad was also wonderful.  Love love love the dressing.  My husband had the spaghetti with meatballs and a side of sausage. He said the sausage was the best he's ever had.  I enjoyed the Raviolli. The dessert of pistachio and chocolate Gelato cake was wonderful!  They were very friendly and took the time to talk to our children and make them feel welcome. They treat you like family and we like that"}
{"text":"Primo Vino is a traditional, family-owned Italian restaurant where the food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is relaxed and casual.   On our last visit, I ordered the chicken piccata, and it was to die for. They also had a pretty unique wine selection, and the bottle we ordered was very tasty.   My favorite part of the meal was dessert - fresh figs, whipped mascarpone and a marsala reduction. My husband and I pretty much raced through it to try to get a bigger portion away from the other.   Lastly, I have to mention that the service always makes you feel very welcome and comfortable - right at home."}
{"text":"Primo Vino is a very interesting place. It reminded me of my dead great uncle's basement. Very old school Italian.   Went with a group of other Yelpers. We came to drink. I think we accomplished what we set out to do.   The bartender was also pretty old school. He had the attitude that every older Italian man has. It's a \"don't be a smartass\" kind of attitude. And don't try to make jokes and don't look at me that way or I'll knock your teeth out. But once you get past that, you're good.   The owner was a nice guy. He made sure everyone was taken care of. Even though we only came to drink. I think they may have thought we were strange... well, whatever. They were right about that.   Hey, Billy!  Next time keep your tongue in your mouth and don't slobber all over my friend (I told him I'd mention him in my review)."}
{"text":"Who are these people giving it 5 stars?  Terrible all around! With all of the other restaurants in the area, why even think about going here...  To be honest I can't believe it's still open..."}
{"text":"This is a solid three star joint. And that's nothing to be ashamed of. Unpretentious and they don't pretend to be a 5 star and then let you down.  Sometimes a 4. Tonight a 4.  Good food and modest prices. Ask your server what's good tonight - you'll be a lot more satisfied. CHEAP OK wines by the glass. Cozy basement setting with a great semi circle bar for socializing  AND they have free parking."}
{"text":"One of the more quirky Little Italy establishments.   I found it somewhat odd that the place is below ground. It's like you're in someone's basement. Not too well lit. Tables are a bit cramped. But I loved it.  I can't comment on the food for all I had was a couple drinks with some fellow Yelpers. But the drinks were good and the entertainment was worth it. The owner is a quick-witted, sharp no-nonsense Italian dude. He made us laugh and I'm sure he's got tons of stories. The locals that were hanging out were also a trip. One of them licked me. Yep, I said LICKED.  I look forward to going back, but I may wear a wetsuit."}
{"text":"The name \"Primo Vino\" pretty much sums it up. They have a nice wine list that is reasonably priced. Forget about it being in a basement, a lot of restaurants in Italy are in basements. Our problem with this restaurant is the food. We started with mussels in white wine sauce. The sauce was good, but 6 out of the 18 mussels were not opened, thus inedible. They did only charge us half for the dish since we pointed the problem out but, those mussels should never have been served in the first place. My husband ordered the lasagna. It was a piece of pasta on the bottom with a very dry ricotta and meat filling in the middle with another piece of pasta on top. It was so over cooked that the pasta could not be cut with a fork. It seemed as if the food had been heated via microwave which would also account for how hot it came to the table. I ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce was watery. It did have some meat in it but it needed more body and less water. We were so disappointed with our meal that we decided to cut our losses and not order dessert. Over-all, this is a place I would avoid."}
{"text":"Primo Vino is one of those restaurants that you really *want* to be good. It seems so promising- it's a cute independent restaurant with a 25-year family legacy in the Little Italy section of Cleveland. The owner comes out and talks to you, the staff is all friendly and funny, that kind of thing. The ambiance is perfect for getting you in the mood to eat a giant plate of delicious Italian cuisine: checkered table clothes, brick walls, wine bottles with Christmas lights strung through them, paintings of Italy on the wall, and bottles of oil with rosemary at every table. There is a spacious, fully-stocked bar with a decent variety of beer, liquor, and wine. So like I said: at first glance, this place is great. More than that, you really *want* it to be great because you want to support a family-owned establishment with a little bit of character. But then you get to the food.   I realized after looking over the menu that I probably wasn't going to be wow-ed by the food at Primo Vino. It was really just your typical, unimaginative handful of old-school American Italian: spaghetti and meatballs, ravioli, spaghetti and sausage, etc., and the cheapest dinner entree was $9.95. I ordered a daily special: broiled salmon and spinach with a side salad and a small bowl of pasta with the meat sauce. Across the board, the entire meal was sub-par. The oil at the table wasn't even olive oil; it was canola oil, which means that it was watery and had no business being used as a dipping liquid for bread. The salad was rubbery and dry (the worst part was their homemade red wine vinegar- I *wanted* it to be good, but it seriously tasted like the smell of nail polish remover), the pasta was overcooked and the sauce was from a can, and even the main entree was disappointing. The salmon was well-cooked but the filet itself was just flavorless, and the spinach with which it was served had obviously just been thawed and slopped on the plate with it, because there was spinach-flavored liquid all over my plate when they brought it out. So, yeah. Disappointing.  Primo Vino: You want to support a family-owned restaurant in Little Italy that has a bit of character, but for the sake of your palate it probably shouldn't be this one."}
{"text":"As the name indicates,wine is first, very good wines at wether best price. Primo has its specialties, spinach and beans,etc all at very reasonable prices. A lot of locals in the place"}
{"text":"I mean, it's not terrible. You won't get sick from eating here. If you're starving and not wanting to wait you'll enjoy this place just fine. It's one of those 2 star places with a 4 or 5 star staff."}
{"text":"Everyone comes from somewhere. Not necessarily where you were born, but where you grow up. A place where memory and context form your entire being. A coming of age if you will. Where places, events, experiences and upbringing form character. Where did I grow up? Where were my fondest memories as a youth? In upstate New York, sitting around Grandma Provenzano and Grandpa McG's red and white checkered table clothed kitchen table.    Sauce, meat, fish, bread and red wine abound. The entire family sitting around, captivated by Grandpa's endless stories of yesteryear. A no frills kitchen, but with plenty of old world charm. Grandma didn't use immersion blenders, microplane graters or other fancy tools to cook her meals. She had a flat edged wooden spoon (flat not by design, but through use) and an old forged steel pot that was probably passed down for three generations previous. She cooked the majority of her meals with these few utensils. But you know what? She never complained about it. And meals at that home in that kitchen were some of the best I've ever had.   Why did I drone on for two paragraphs about my childhood in a Primo Vino review? Because this place seemed familiar to me. This was my youth! Descending to that basement, seeing the large families gathering around the red and white checkered tables breaking bread together, the cheap red wine poured by the no-nonsense bartender, the Italian Lemon Ice, similar to the stuff my Uncle Guy Bonomo used to make? All reminders of my youth. I felt home here. Memories of a much simpler time were reminisced in the basement of Primo Vino. For the short time I shared with friends in that dining room, I had a moment, perhaps an epiphany. Life slowed down for a short while. We solved all the world's problems over a few glasses of red. These are the times I cherish in life. I'm nostalgic. I'm sentimental. The basement dining room at Primo Vino was a replica to a scene I remember growing up in and I took great comfort in capturing a moment like that during our visit."}
{"text":"Cute interior, very cozy Dinners include a lot of food, good portion sizes Pasta is cooked perfectly al-dente Good service It's a little more expensive than what I'd usually pay for the quality of food you get though."}
{"text":"Wait staff was painfully slow, food is taken from a bar side fridge that remained open for the hour we were there. We had to ask for bread, and got a cold rock hard mini loaf in a basket. I've had better food from a from box. It looks charming when you sit down but it's all downhill from there."}
{"text":"There is very little here for vegetarians--and what I ended up getting (a fava bean salad) was tough and had little taste, mostly just vinegar with a really weird chemical taste. Yuck. I would stay away from anything with their vinegar.  Their so-called \"meatless\" sauce is really \"low-meat\" sauce... it's got meat stock rather than solid meat. I respect that that is traditional, but a few more options for vegetarians could still be on the menu, making them able to accommodate a more diverse party of diners.  I didn't like what I had, nor the underground atmosphere--however, I don't like to rate one star based only on my subjective preferences, and the service was fine. So, two stars."}
{"text":"The server was excellent. She had a great personality and seemed to be genuinely funny. The food was decent. As other reviewers have mentioned, the brick wall basement is an excellent dining room. The prices were comparable to most Italian restaurants and cheaper than some in Little Italy. I do plan on returning some time in the future."}
{"text":"\"Ubriaco Depravazione\" stop 2.  Wow. I was literally wowed by this place. Most people probably would wonder why, but something about this place spoke to me. Maybe it's because we were in a basement bar. Maybe it was the gruff, but full of character bartender. Or the guy licking yelper #%!$#!#^ 's arm. It was classy, but wild. Quiet, yet loud.  We  sat around a circular bar that allowed our group of seven to all see each other and interact. We were all starting to feel our body buzzes at this point. I had a Pernod off of the aperitif/digestivo section of the menu. It was very absinthey and nice to sip on rocks. Most had wine, but yelper $@#&!^ went right for the sorbet. It was served inside of a lemon and looked hella refreshing. We all bs'd and soaked up the vibe, which  is less family friendly, and more secret underground club. Not to compare anything to the VTR, but it had that speakeasy hidden gem feeling, you know?  Didn't try any food, so that's out. But as far as boozing, this was the highlight of the night for me."}
{"text":"Place is a joke, I tried to go down because I spend a lot of time in the neighborhood and its been there forever.  Called at 9pm on a Friday night, asked if they could squeeze 4 in since every other spot was packed down in Little Italy, He puts me on hold and comes back and says if you come now I can squeeze you in.  We get there 5 minutes later theres only one other couple in the restaurant, we ate the food, poor quality, 9:41pm 2 of the people in our party ask to order more drinks, the server goes \"We're closing down, sorry.\"  We said you close in 19 minutes, don't you want to make a few more bucks on another round of drinks?  \"No, he replied and that's the owner right there.\"  That was all I needed to hear, will never go back, there are plenty of good spots in the neighborhood, not wasting my time there again."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great places to eat in Little Italy. This place is not one of them.  Like some others have said, I wanted to like this place. I really did. It had that homey feel of eating in someone's basement. That's about where the charm ended.  Myself and my big party (10 other people) received a lot of attitude from the wait staff, when we were fortunate enough to get his attention. As others have commented, you can see the stacks of microwaves in the kitchen. As others have commented, they don't put out real olive oil on the table (is it really that expensive? I don't think so).   I will admit, the main dish I ordered was actually tasty (some lemon chicken), but that lemon chicken was accompanied by a sad bowl of penne with marinara sauce. Really? And the same went with the majority of the dishes. We also ordered a lot of appetizers, and the stuffing for the stuffed peppers reminded me of cat food and saw dust. To round it out, it took an hour to get the check.  I really like eating at a ethnic, locally owned restaurant, but I will never go back to Primo Vino again."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Cleveland area and now live in California. Every time that we visit we eat at Primo Vino. The waiter is a little grumpy, but that's part of the experience. The food is great and at great prices. I'm used to paying $17 - $25 at other restaurants for food that is not nearly as good and as fresh as the food at Primo Vino and Primo Vino does it for quite a bit less. Serving sizes are large.  The atmosphere is great, especially if you have young kids, as you won't feel that you need to keep them perfectly quiet."}
