{"text":"First time going there today. We had Original ramen with pork soup and Black ramen with chicken soup.   First of all, both ramen were just average. Nothing exceptional. The soup is hot enough, but the noodles were a bit too hard to my taste. The eggs were over cooked. The pork shoulder was small.   And then, they charge $1 extra for the pork soup, which in my opinion doesn't taste much different from the chicken soup, except more greasy.   Paying $10.50 and $11.50 for a bowl of ramen this quality, it is obviously over priced.   Service was very slow. The waitress was friendly though.   Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this new ramen place at lunch. No line ups should have been a sign that it would be just okay. We ordered the spicy ramen and the garlic ramen. Small portions. No msg. Pork belly was more fat than meat and was soggy. Egg tasted off.  There was also construction being done beside the kitchen (is that safe for food?! Likely not coming back soon. We prefer sansotei or chef papa instead for uptown ramen."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed!!! I called this location yesterday at around 2:45pm and asked if they do reservations, if they were open and I also told whoever answered the phone that we will be at the place within 30mins, so he said yes they were open and doesn't need any reservations and he also said it was fine for us to just walk in when we arrive at the place. So we got there at around 3:12pm and I was pissed because the lady told us that they have a break at 3pm to 5pm. Most of the Ramen places have their Hours of Operation on their Website and it does state that they will close at a certain hour and will reopen. But Touhenboku's website doesn't say that at all, and i called anyways to make sure that they will be open and the guy that I spoke to over the phone assured me that they are open and i clearly told him that we will be at the place within half an hour! Very very disappointing!  When we got there the lady just stopped us at the door and told us that they will be on break, i did expressed my disappointment and she just said sorry and no other explanation on why did the guy told us that it is ok to come at that time!!!!. For the nth time i was very very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and ordered different ramen (thick, thin) , pork soup, and appetizer  Food - decent, good soup base, nice runny egg Price - high for what you get. you are hungry if you are a regular consumer. good for young slim couples. you get one slice of pork, one egg, and a bit of soup ... a few pieces of seaweed. service - very good. courteous staff  if they can give you more for the price, it will change my rating a bit!"}
{"text":"Please update the hours on your website! Hours state open until 10pm. On a Wednesday, we tried to call over 10 times from 8:40 to order take out. And it played music, rang then went to voicemail. We ended up driving there and by 9pm and it was dark and closed!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I have been to many ramen places around the GTA, from the known to be subpar (Ajisan) to the higher end (Momofoku) to the miscellaneous (Kinton, Hakata Shoryuken...). None of them have beat the flavour that I experienced the first time I had the black garlic ramen at Touhenboku. There's just something about the ramen broth that gets me every time. I have never left this place feeling unsatisfied or regretful that I chose to eat there.  With that said, I think they really need to work on some of their smaller side order dishes. The ebi mayo I had once was pretty bad and they can do some much better for a price tag of $9 dollars."}
{"text":"Portions are too small, and our wait for take-out was a 40 minute wait. There are many other ramen stores that are more comparable in the area in terms of portion, broth, etc. Quite expensive for the food that we got."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, especially the Noodles. Also the staff are friendly, the service professional. I would totally come back again!"}
{"text":"Saturday Lunch it was not busy.  The place is clean, and the washrooms are clean!!  The food tasted okay, and the service was above average. However my wife found butchers twine in her ramen........... 4 pieces in total.  Please takeout the butchers twine after you marinate and slice the pork. It's not pleasant chewing on butchers twine and noodles too!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is very new, clean, and spacious but they do not have enough servers. We had to wait a while to order our food, did not get any attention after sitting down, and we asked to refill water 3 times before someone actually did it. The food is only at a decent quality, it is definitely not one place I would recommend to family or friends. The portion of the ramen is quite small. I think there are way better ramen places I've been."}
{"text":"What I'm real surprised is that people won't stop whining about the food they had here. Having tried ramen at Japan don't always mean you know what you're saying as there are always good and bad poutine and back bacon in TO. My tung says these guys did real good job on making ramen already, and I tell you what, my Black tonkotsu ramen got me running throughout 3 meetings after all. I'm satisfied, and I'm coming back as I don't like what other ramen shops mixing with all sort of powder stuffs at the back of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was very pleased when my friend suggested we go for Ramen and it turned out to be Touhenboku. I love their spot on Queen street and since I live North of the city it's great that this is a little closer.    If I was able to I would give it 4.5, not 5 stars because they didn't have some of the things on the menu that I wanted. I understand it comes with opening a new restaurant, but still I was a little disappointed.  Also the staff were a bit chaotic and we had three different people come to our table.  They were friendly but it makes it confusing. I prefer to deal with one server.  You could tell they were not very experienced but that may improve with time.  The decor is very plain and seems a little empty compared to Queen street where you're bumping elbows with other people.  Here it felt like they could put a few more tables in.  It might even improve the feel.  I did like the little spaces under the seat for your bag. reminded me of Japan and very handly so no one is tripping and your bag isn't sitting on the ground.  Anyway to the Ramen.  I ordered the red (spicy) ramen with thin noodles, shio (sea salt), and the pork belly.  Personally I prefer thin noodle to the thick ones because I feel they hold more sauce.  I also prefer the pork belly because it's the fat that makes it taste so good.  Some people might find it a bit rich though.  It's made with the chicken broth which can be pretty rich as well.  My friend ordered the light ramen which has a clear broth because he didn't like the rich broth last time.  He said it tasted like shitake mushrooms and liked it enough he got an extra bowl of noodles. There is an extra fee for that but it's cheap like a dollar or something.   All in all I was very pleased, There is room for improvement but just minor things. I think this place will only get better.  I love ramen and hope they keep expanding North."}
{"text":"I was happy that when my friends told me that another Touhenboku Ramen opened in Richmond Hill just around corner from my place!!   I ordered the shoyu broth with thick noodle this time. I usually order their sea salt broth with thin noodle.  I enjoyed the shoyu broth very much.  I like their creamy broth which reminds me my favourite ramen restaurant back in my home town in Japan.  Now I can visit this restaurant!!  I gave four stars because the service was somewhat not organized and servers seem a bit confused. I guess this is because they just opened just two weeks or so.  There is room for kaizen for sure.   I will definitely come back to taste my comfort food."}
{"text":"Pretty good in my last visit. Nice broth, good service too! A bit salty for me though."}
{"text":"There was a Groupon for this place and my family and I decided to check this place out for dinner last night - I've always passed by the Queen West Touhenboku location and wondered how the ramen was compared to other stores and today was my chance to finally find out! For $45 (plus tax, and tip), we got 4 bowls of ramen, 2 donburi dishes, 2 appetizers, and 2 desserts.   After looking at the menu, we were really looking forward to trying the recommended Shouga-Yaki Don (grilled ginger pork) for donburi, and the takoyaki and gyoza for appetizers. But, when we flagged the waitress down to order, she told us that they were out of the Shouga-Yaki Don, and basically the whole appetizers menu except for the korokke (Japanese croquettes) and karaage (Japanese fried chicken). In the end, we opted for the Yakitori Don and Chashu Pork Don, and the korokke and karaage as our appetizers. My mom and I got the regular shio ramen with thick noodles, while my dad and brother both got the black (garlicky) ramen with thin noodles. We were quite impressed with the donburis, especially the yakitori - it wasn't dry, and the sauce was flavourful and coated the rice very nicely. The chashu pork was a bit dry but the rice was also good. The korokke was very creamy and was perfectly sized for two bites while the karaage was also crispy but juicy when bitten into. The mayonnaise dipping sauce went perfectly with the karaage. But when we got the ramens, we were all quite disappointed. The broth was too rich for me (I should have gone for the clear broth) and the noodles were a bit slimy (the thin noodles are better). The best part of the ramen was the egg, if I were to be totally honest - it was perfectly softboiled with a runny center. Can't go wrong with a great softboiled egg! But overall, we were all quite underwhelmed as we have had better ramen elsewhere. We moved onto dessert, where we got the cheesecake and discovered that it was quite delicious. I spied some vanilla beans in it, which gave the cheesecake a nice flavour.  All in all, the ramen is just ok. Not as bad as other places, but definitely not as good as ramen can be. It's ironic that we enjoyed everything BUT the ramen here."}
{"text":"We received terrible service from the waiter named Jacob. When we asked to order, he went to serve another table. Then he went to put in their order before coming to serve us. He did not acknowledge or say that he would serve us after. We had five people and he only set us up with four utensils. He did not give us water when we sat down and only gave us water when prompted. My friends ordered ice cream and he did not ask what flavours until we  specifically told him after he walked away. Also, he got one of the orders wrong and had to go back to the kitchen to change the flavour. He also looked like he had flat affect the whole time. In general, the food was fine but the waiter experience made it terrible."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight, a Wednesday, at 6:00pm.  Walked in and sat down to waitress saying \"would you like to order drink or appetizer?\" before we even had a menu.    Sat down with a menu, picked two appetizers to order.  Waitress comes back \"sorry, we don't have either of those\".  OK.  I'd like to order iced tea (on the menu).  \"sorry we don't have that\".  What do you have???  \"Well, for donburi we only have the fried chicken\" (out of the seven varieties on the menu).    We eventually ordered two bowls of ramen, and one donburi.  The food was ok, maybe even good, but the service was so bad that it overshadowed the food.  Asked for the bill.  Waited.  Asked again.  Waited.  Bill came.  I stupidly pointed out that it was missing one soup. Waited while two waitresses realized they had no idea how to fix it.  Waited some more.  Waitress says she needs her manager, who is busy talking to someone.  Wait more.  Finally she brings the correct bill which we paid.  At no point did she say THANK YOU for the fact that we pointed out we were going to be undercharged.  All in all, food was just ok.  Service was bloody awful.  Didn't have most items on their menu.  Really wanted to like this location of a good ramen restaurant, but tonight was really bad."}
{"text":"Did not think there is good Ramen place so up north :p visit in ice storm weekend such a delight.   Services: very friendly. (A fewer customers that day I guess we also got all the attentions:)   Environment: mordant, stylish, clean.   Food: super yummy, topping does have veg choice though."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of ramen in Toronto, so I would give this place a pass for flavour.  I had the yelpers recommended garlic broth with pork shoulder and egg.  While the broth was rich, I found the garlic a bit too burnt for my liking.  The thin noodles were fine, and we also tried the fried chicken with mayo dipping sauce which was also a bit bland.  Service was friendly"}
{"text":"I'd have to give it a 2 star rather than 3. The food tastes great, fresh.   I requested if they could have the half boiled eggs to be fully cooked because I am pregnant. The waitress was hesitant and said these eggs are already precooked the way it is and they can't do anything about it. How can you not? Food is food, you can cook it longer whether it is precooked or not.   It was very disappointing to hear that it cannot be done. So I gave my raw egg that was split in half to my husband. A simple request can't be done and not accommodating to your first time client isn't right.   There's minimal seating and you can't make reservations. Parking is ridiculous during peak times.   Decor is nice, feels fresh and clean inside. However, they really need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Used to enjoy this place as it's close by, serves decent tonkotsu ramen, and not busily packed with guests. Now that I've been here a couple of times, I kind of understand the reason why.  They have recently updated their menu to serve more variety of soup base and topings. We ordered a mushroom cream ramen, and the both tastes a little like cream of mushroom soup. The portion is decent, soup is hot, comes with a ramen egg. But that's about it. For the price they charge (~$14 per bowl), it is nothing out of the ordinary. With all the competition in town and all kinds of ramen joints popping up, I don't see what makes Tohenboku unique.  Furthermore, although my family don't normally dwell around the restaurant to chat and mingle, the staff seemed to have rushed us to take our bowls away and offered us the bill even before one of us were done.  Probably would opt for other ramen joints in the future."}
{"text":"The seating is cute, and the menu is nicely designed. I find the ramen itself is average, I didn't really like the noodles. The presentation wasn't super beautiful like Naruto ramen. Overall, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Very happy to have a new ramen spot nearby, food is good and price is decent.  Their combo deals are interesting, and I like the idea of earning the loyalty card.  We added extra pork to our ramen and both tried the garlic flavour, it was a bit odd that porkbone soup was extra cost, but overall a good experience. Interior decor wise could use improvement, service was prompt and good."}
{"text":"I have been there once?it is totally my style. The fried chicken popcorn was so crispy and not that much oily?I love it."}
{"text":"The ramen soup was very salty. The pork belly was a little tough compared to kinton and sansotei and didn't taste as fresh. However this place given the location near Richmond hill servers well."}
{"text":"I came here with a groupon for two, which included two bowls of ramen, an appetizer, a don burri and a dessert. I've eaten at Touhenboku before, in their downtown location.   Both my girlfriend and I got the black garlic ramen, we ordered the takoyaki and a fried chicken don. The takoyaki is pretty good, the fried chicken don was average, and the ramen was okay. We've had better ramen at other places.  However, their service was extremely terrible. Our waiter seemed extremely uninterested in serving our group, ignoring us for a lengthy period of time, and just seemed annoyed with us for some reason. They also ran out of dessert (cheesecake or a crepe cake) and told us the alternative was two bowls of ice creams.   Overall, the groupon is a fairly decent deal but I won't be buying it again. Their ramens aren't the most filling or largest portions either, and I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Saturday night! It was quite busy, but not enough to have to wait. They have comfy chairs and the Wifi password on the menu stand. The menu itself may seem confusing at first but it is really just intended to give you options.   I went with thick ramen in the Original Broth, with pork belly. Also got the student special even without showing my Student ID (guess the look is enough) so free glass of Coke! Yes...in a glass. Classic. OG. Whatever you want to call it. Onto the ramen. It was alright. Broth did not have that bold taste in comparison to the other places around this area (Kyouka, Koi Sakana, Sansotei etc.) and was quite oily in my opinion. The meat toppings were pretty good. Nice thick slices. The noodles were decent. But its rare you find a place that can screw up the noodles.  It is a great location. Lots of people living around and a school right behind it. Just hoped that they would deliver more. There are better options in Richmond Hill for ramen so unless I get bored of those...probably not gonna come back!"}
{"text":"Always excited for a new ramen joint in the area, but this one was a bit of a let down.   Came by on a Sunday night after work and the restaurant was completely barren. Not a single customer in sight. Granted I get that it was a Sunday night, but that was a new level of dead. The decor was quite nice, as it gave off a Japanese kotatsu feel to it, but was a little inconvenient, as the chairs didn't have backs making it difficult to find somewhere to put your coat.  So I ordered Takoyaki and Spicy Ramen with Pork Belly, and my friend got the Black Ramen. The takoyaki was done quite well, but the ramen was a little lacking. The portion was small, not much flavour to the soup, and my noodles were even in clumps. The noodles were a little expensive for that size as well, starting at $10.50.   The service was good, as the server was really nice. However, we 'were' the only ones in there, so hard to say when it's any busier.   Probably not the ramen joint I will frequent, as there are others in the area that are a little better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Noodles are average. Tastes more Chinese than Japanese ramen. Soup is good. I've been here twice having the thin noodles. Extra noodles are only a couple bucks. Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"3 stars max.. Leaning towards a 2.5 stars  I tried one location in downtown and sort of happy to see another ramen shop in uptown besides Sansotei... And when I walked by, there is no line up! Yay! Let's give it a try...  The place is big and new, looks tidy. But the food is more important. So I tried the pork based ramen, the soup is hot enough which I like but lacks the flavour - it's some thick broth but hardly has any taste or flavour in the soup. And the egg yolk was not runny that I normally expect from Japanese ramen. Somehow, the ramen overall and the taste doesn't meet my expectation. and the service needs improvement as well. For example, when I asked for the bill, it took a long time and seems that they need to wait for specific people to handle the bill... which is fine to have specific person to do this job but the end result is the bill take a long time to come ...  Not sure if I will visit this location soon..."}
{"text":"$11.50 for standard ramen with pork belly and soy based soup + $1.50 for extra noodles.  Noodles don't really taste like ramen and soup base was flavourless and thick ( they probably cooked the noodles in the broth). They really cheaped out on the soup in general (hardly any soup and the noodles soaked up almost all of it after eating for 5min).   Also ordered the large for $18.  Portion is like getting a large Pho but you are paying $8-9 more.  Its a real ripoff and would never go back there again. Total damage was close to $40 for eating dog food.  BTW the frozen ramen noodles from Sun noodles are 10x better and you can buy them at T&T supermarkets http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/the-fresh-ramen-kits-from-sun-noodles-will-knock-your-socks-off.html  Ajisen Ramen is probably the best of the worst i have tried in the GTA."}
{"text":"The soup was very thick and creamy as advertised in the menu, the thin noodles were firm, and there were a lot of wood ear mushrooms and green onions.  I adored the smoothness and softness of the boiled egg.  It had a very soft yoke that was to die for.  It was so good and well boiled!  I really liked the pork shoulder meat too -- it wasn't as tough as I was afraid it might have been.  The pork shoulder texture was just right and not chewy either."}
{"text":"This place is alright, nothing real special about it. There are better options out there. The price is ok - pretty average. I did find their noodles too salty though.  The layout of the place is also very Japanese style, but I think they just finished cleaning the washroom, it smelled like washroom in there.   It's nice that this place is in Richmond Hill, and it's close to home - but they need to up their game on their food for the competition that's around. The staff are friendly and they are pretty quick with their food. It's not woah, this place is awesome. It' just very average here.  Overall, I don't think I'll come back. There are better options!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looked so promising but we were so disappointed! First off, the prices are kind of expensive. It's an extra dollar to have pork instead of chicken broth, and another $1.50 if you want miso. So my boyfriend and I shared a ramen and don set - spicy pork miso ramen and ginger pork don. The rice for the don is your average Chinese rice that you make at home, and I couldn't taste any ginger in the pork - only soy sauce. The ramen was even more disappointing - the noodles are like Chinese noodles and I don't think are ramen noodles at all?? All we can taste is the chili flavour in the soup, and none of the miso. Lastly the egg was not soft boiled with the jelly texture, it was just a hard boiled egg. Probably will not return again."}
{"text":"Had the pork soup base (+1$). Felt incredibly \"rich\". The fat was solidifying as I was eating it. Next time I'll try the chicken soup. Thin noodle texture was good. Pork belly appeared to be steamed.. Normally prefer a bit of a sear to it. Soft boiled egg and garnishes were good."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place because the craving for ramen was at an all time high!  You get a warm welcome when you first enter the place and the first impression of the place is good decor, wide open space, and clean and new. Looking at the menu, the food is mostly customizable. First, you get too choose the base flavor, which is basically a choice of original ramen, black garlic, red spicy, and light. After, you get to choose soup base (chicken or pork), meat (pork shoulder, pork belly, chicken), and noodle thickness.  The food itself does not look as refined or visually aesthetic as some high end ramen places, and the price is not so cheap. The portion size is small, so you may want to try some of the combos, which comes with an extra portion of meat.  But once you actually start digging into the food, I found it was quite surprisingly tasty! We ordered the garlic base and was extremely flavorful, but felt it was not too salty, which is a problem at various other ramen places.  In summary, worth a visit, but a bit expensive, smaller portions, not as refined, but the flavors hit the mark!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was open in Richmond Hill until I walked passed it. It is located in a strip plaza in Richmond Hill, with a Starbuks, Ten Ren and Food Basic close by. I ordered the Red Spicy Ramen. The soup was as described, thick and creamy. I think because it was spicy, it almost similar to a Tantan Mien broth, though not as flavourful. It was a little strange that it's an extra 1$ for Pork broth. The noodles were pretty good, but nothing crazy special. A good place to get a ramen fix if you're in Richmond Hill and don't feel like braving the line or want to drive to Sansotei. I did think I had a better experience because I opted for the spicy version. My sister ordered the White Ramen (their classic) felt that the noodles were a bit bland."}
{"text":"It's next to impossible to find ramen north of Highway 7 but this is one option. The menu is simple and the decor and service is great. However, the ramen is quite disappointing. Bland with only one piece of meat and really non-ramen-looking thin noodles. My soft-boiled egg looked mangled and sad. A regular bowl costs $13 with tax. Better off going to Kinton which is about 15 minutes away and miles ahead in terms of quality. If you want speed and quietness though, Touhenboku is alright."}
{"text":"It doesn't feel authentic like kinton or the many Japanese ramen joints near Dundas station. Definitely not Japanese speaking employees or owner (assuming).  That being said, not many options in Richmond Hill.   The food was fine, the karage was good enough for me to eat to order it again in the future, crispy, nicely battered and not too salty. You get to choose the broth, noodle thickness, cut of meat for the ramen which is nice and it tasted pretty good. I would go again for the convenience and limited options on my area for ramen and But $11 a bowl seems reasonable enough for me!  Good ramen experience makes me drink the broth at the end, I didn't do that here.   The service was quite good, they would try to greet and send you off Japanese style but the enthusiasm just isn't there. Which the other ramen places downtown do, I expect it now!   TL /DR : good but not great. Non authentic ramen experience. Few ramen options out of the city uptown."}
{"text":"Visited the new location @ Bayview & Major Mackenzie. We got a table instantly, it wasn't too busy on a Friday night. We ordered the Karaage & the Black Garlicky Ramen. The Karaage, tender juicy chicken was really good! The ramen was good. This is a good place to go to if you are craving a quick ramen fix."}
{"text":"Ordered this from Uber Eats tonight because my boyfriend was craving ramen. Noodles are subpar and remind me of the noodles you get from instant ramen. Really cheaped-out on the vegetables in my vegetarian ramen and the cut of chicken in my boyfriends black garlic ramen was a strange cut of grey meat. Potato croquettes were good. Fried chicken was very poor quality dark meat but tasted okay. Not worth $50, and wouldn't order from here again but glad we tried it. Worth mentioning, service was excellent and very helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I am a regular and I always get the pork broth + garlicky soup + thin noodles + pork shoulder. Yum. Definitely my favourite ramen place in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. The speed of the service is quick, the servers and chefs always have a positive and friendly attitude, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very relaxed and clean. The prices are pretty standard and one bowl of ramen usually fills me up (though I do find the portions a tad bit smaller than some other ramen restaurants I've been to).  Clearly, I don't have any complaints and I would recommend trying this place out, especially if you are a fan of ramen dishes. I will certainly try to expand my selection of food in the future, as the restaurant does offer many other items in addition to just ramen. Overall, Touhenboku is a great place to have a sit down meal that is fast, affordable, and satisfying!  Tip for a free drink of pop: show them your student card for the student special :)"}
{"text":"Very inefficient service. Got a line up of people waiting at the door for seats and yet the servers are incredibly slow to take orders, bring bills and clear tables. They ran out of all chicken dishes at popular Sunday lunch hour - many other customers disappointed they could not get Kaarage fried chicken, bbq chicken donburi, or chicken chashu. Pork belly chashu was very very fatty compared to other ramen places. Ramen and soup were okay. Sansotei Markham is better - ramen is cheaper there and service is way faster."}
{"text":"I may not be a Ramen connoisseur, but I rather like the soups at this place. I like how I can choose the flavours (just a shame that all my favs - pork, miso cost extra). The portions are decent and I prefer the thin noodles. Also a bit pricer than other places. I still come back regularly."}
{"text":"Not overly authentic and when compared to some of the others around for town,  this one will lose out.   But given the location in Richmond Hill,  relative ease of parking,  this is not a bad choice.   Food is decent, fresh,  environment is nice and the service good.   A nice change of pace from the typical Chinese in the area.   Is it Wow?  No.   Is is Bad?  No.  Will I come back?  YES."}
{"text":"I definitely like the downtown branch more.   Yes, I already knew that the toppings are very little, but I loved the soup base so I stuck through. I mean, it's a little pricey ($11.50) to just get ONE slice of meat in your ramen, but the souuup. The taste of all the food was great but goshdang the soup was so fattening. Good thing they don't have a program like Kinton with Kinton bowler because I don't think my stomach could handle it.  I had black garlicky soup, which is my ultimate fav, paired with sea salt in chicken broth, and thick noodles. It's pretty much my go-to. The downtown location has better soup because it isn't as fatty. The broth I got here was so fat that it congealed the moment the bowl landed on my table. .. Ew?   At least the soup and ramen were hot. This is rarer than you would think.   The service here was definitely excellent. The waiter was very nice, smiled, and checked with the kitchen on a discount I saw here. Turns out the $16.80 for 2 ramens is only available downtown. Who knew?!   So...  For service: come to this branch.  For soup/food: go to the downtown branch"}
{"text":"If you're comparing it to ramen places all over Toronto, this place doesn't even cut it close. If you're comparing it to ramen around the GTA, this place is better than most.   I was glad to come try it out, especially with it being close to my house. I know this place is a chain but I've never tried it so I was definitely excited as I pulled up the the parking lot. Tables are wooden and the place is wide and open. There weren't a lot of people here but I can definitely see it being packed with high school kids wandering over from bayview secondary during the lunch hour. If I was still in high school, this shit would be up my alley.   The service was extremely quick and friendly. They were always smiley and came over several times to check up on us. One thing about the menu that's weird is the fact that they charge an extra $1.50 for pork soup base when it's kind of a basic thing for any ramen place. I ordered the red spicy base with pork belly/soy sauce/thick noodle & it was enjoyable. Broth was medium-rich and the noodles were super chewy and texturized. One thing though, the portions were the tiniest I've ever seen. For anyone with a larger appetite, you're definitely not going to be satisfied.  Also ordered the karaage and the takoyaki, which was were both alright. Takoyaki was doughy and packed full of octopus but it definitely had too much sauce all over it, which was too overpowering.   Overall, an okay place in rhill for ramen. Would probably come back."}
{"text":"We came hopping we found a great ramen place near our home. Atmosphere was great - light and airy, well designed and inviting. Menu was awesome, not a ton of options and to the point, (I prefer that in ramen joints). Service was good - very attentive and friendly. Most importantly, disappointment in the ramen. We both had the black ramen which did not look like the pictures at all but still looked like a decent bowl of ramen. Noodles were great - nice and chewy. Soup and pork belly was a fail. The soup did not have that depth of flavour and was quite watery tasting and the pork belly was not as tender as it should be. The fat in the pork belly melted in your mouth but you're left chewing the rest of the meat that should be much more tender. It's too bad, this place looks so nice I really hoped it would be better."}
{"text":"absolutely terrible im sorry but everything about this restaurant makes me want to hurl and i swear to all the ramen gods that i will NEVER set foot into this place again.  first off, i find the servers extremely awkward (maybe it has to do with the fact that they are young and inexperienced yet but still)   second, the ramen was just dreadful. i got the spicy flavoured one with: sea salt, pork belly and thick noodles. the ramen was not your typical Japanese ramen. to me it was like idk spaghetti noodles like EXCUUUUUSE ME I AINT GONNA PAY NO $10 for SOME DAMN SPAGHETTI NOODLES also it wasn't cooked throughly (still tasted a bit hard) the portion was too small for what i paid for and not to mention the presentation was just an embarrassment. i would've taken a picture but i didn't want to burden my phone with such a horrendous thing. the flavours weren't very compatible and the chilli oil had a weird aftertaste idk  anyways yeah overall just terrible. and i got a real bad stomachache after it now lemme say HOMEGIRL here has a pretty strong stomach but yeah this caused me to feel extremely disgusted and expect to sit at the toilet a few times just saying LOOL    oh yeah another thing i find it ridiculous that I have to pay for extra toppings like excuse me?! WHY DO CHOPPED ONIONS HAVE TO BE $1.00?! AM I PAYING TO EAT ONION GOLD?! DOES IT TAKE THAT MUCH SKILL TO CHOP SOME ONIONS LIKE jeez sorry my opinion but yeah redonculous."}
{"text":"Food was average at best.  Service was slow and for one of our orders they brought the wrong Ramen.   Charged extra for pork soup base - talk about money grab.   I was hoping this place would be decent as it's conveniently located unfortunately it looks like I'll have to go a little further to get better ramen"}
{"text":"We went there last winter right after a ski day. Perfect food after a whole day of coldness. Serving very fast, and very friendly waitresses.  I ordered a spicy pork soup noodle, and I love it. I don't know what kind of chilly sauce they put into, but it goes very well with the noodle. The egg is also made well and felt authentic too."}
{"text":"I've had Ramen several times in Vancouver and Toronto but not like this. I usually find it a bit too salty or too bland. This was my first time here and I ordered the light chicken broth miso. It was great!! I also had the chicken Karage and unlike a few places, this place actually had big pieces of meat. I'm not an expert when it comes to Ramen, but having worked in the restaurant business and growing up in a family where good food is appreciated and celebrated, I can say that I will definitely be back to this place!! The service was pretty good too and the owner always has a smile on his face and is welcoming. Maybe a good place to have a nice birthday meal in April!!! :)"}
{"text":"Purchased a $ 24 Groupon for a rice donburi, appetizer, 2 bowls of ramen & dessert. My mother and I throughly enjoyed our meal. Wait time was short, which was a bonus! The downside is that the Groupon was actually in USD dollars!! I checked my credit card statement last night, and it looked like the $24 Groupon got converted into USD dollars. I paid almost $40 for our meal, which was the actual cost of our meal (without a Groupon). Very misleading! I don't know why they would advertise this as USD dollars, as this is a Canadian business. Shame on them."}
{"text":"I have been to many ramen restaurants ( Kinton, Kenzo, Sansotei...etc) by far this is the worst.  To my surprise I had to pay extra for pork bone broth, which should be standard for traditional ramen.  Portion was way too small and my ramen only had one piece of thin pork meat.  Overall, my bowl of ramen looked and tasted sad.  I personally think you will get better value for the money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Taste just as awesome as their Queen West location in downtown and now I don't have to travel a long way there anymore. Because now they open an new store in our neighborhood, very conviently for me.  Plenty of parking spaces. Why I love Touhenboku?  I can just have 2 orders of chicken karages (super juicy inside and crisp outside) and one bowl of spicy meatlover Ramen that will satisfied my cravings for Japanese Ramen."}
{"text":"\"A-OK\" ramen. Nothing amazing but safe to try. Probably one of the lighter broths I've had. I had the White ramen with pork soup, sea salt seasoning, thin noodles, pork belly. Lots of green onion & soft wood ear."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. The restaurant was well staffed.  The food tasted decent, not the worse ramen we've had in TO but definitely wasn't the best either. My meal (lunch combo) costed ~$19 after tax and tip.   The only complaint I have for this restaurant is the value/portion.  I have heard much about the legendarily stingy portions of this restaurant before coming here and MAN this place really took no time to prove them right. The \"iced water\" we requested obviously didn't come with any ice, and came half-full in whiskey glasses which are gulped down in two sips. We ended up asking for 3 refills. The ramen came with ONE, THIN slice of pork. Not to mention the overall small portion. For $19 I was really expecting more.  If you're looking for a ramen fix without breaking your wallet, this won't be the place for you."}
{"text":"Overall, the best place about this location is their amazing service! Same food you would get at any other Touhenboku Ramen. If you've never been to Touhenboku Ramen before, be sure to try the Karaage Donburi.   Service 5/5 - When my family and I went there, all 3 waiters very polite, patient and helpful. They accommodated our group very well and never have i received the same level of service in any other ramen or noodle house, nor do I expect the amazing service that they provided from a ramen place.   Food 4/5 - To be honest, I feel that all Ramen places taste more or less the same. However, Touhenboku offers more customization than pretty much all other ramen places I have been to, allowing you to pick what type of soup base, meat, noodle, etc. that you want. We also had a side of Karaage and I had a Karaage Donburi and both were really good.   Price 4/5 - not much to say about it, decent food for a reasonable price. I'd say the best bang of the buck in terms of taste and fill would be the Karaage Donburi."}
{"text":"$10.50 + tax and tip for an average sized and average quality bowl of Ramen is pretty steep for lunch in Richmond Hill. I went to try it today for the first time at 11:15am, and was out in 25 minutes. The original flavour chicken soup base with soy sauce, thin noodles and pork belly looked small, but the soup and pork was quite fatty that it filled me up by the end. The noodle quality is so so. And the soup is salty and has too much MSG. I wish I had a student card to get a free glass bottle of Coke product (normally $2).   Overall, it wasn't too bad, but it did not impress me. I probably will not be returning any time soon, unless friends suggest to meet there.  3 stars for the food and service, but 2 stars because of the price that comes with it."}
{"text":"Finally, a ramen place in the suburbs.   This place has a student special; ramen with a pop for 10.99. This includes university students; not just high school students. For those of you who are still in school, you can take advantage of it.   It was not so crowded when my group went on a Sunday evening. Plenty of space which is what I like unlike the crammed, smaller ramen restaurants. Good lighting and decor.   The takoyakis and black ramen broth with the pork belly was delicious. In my opinion, there's not much of a difference between the thin and thick noodles. They looked pretty much the same when we were comparing. Service was great and definitely willing to come back again.   Since it is near a high school, I would try not to go during the high school lunch and after school times."}
{"text":"Came for some ramen with some friends on a Sunday night. To order you choose: 1) Soup Flavour 2) Soup Base: Chicken or Pork ($1 extra) 3) Seasoning 4) Noodle Type 5) Meat  Ordered a Thick Ramen in Spicy Pork Broth with Pork Belly, a Chicken Karage and a Mille Crepes cake. Show your student card and you get a free glass bottle of pop.  The ramen was okay. I would've enjoyed slightly more meat toppings (there was only 1 slice). I found the flavour of my girlfriend's Garlicky Chicken soup better. I expected the chicken karage to be more crispy, but the taste was alright. The cakes here are quite nice."}
{"text":"I would say this new ramen joint is just ok. I had higher expectations due to reviews at their locations.  We ordered the black ramen with sea salt and thick noodles. The noodles were a bit undercooked however,  the broth was thick and Creamy with lots of flavour.   We asked for the Japanese red pepper flakes but instead got a bowl of black pepper, was not impressed with that.   For dessert, we ordered the crepe cake and it was pretty good, a little on the dense side but the taste was there.   Good for a quick fix if you're nearby. As this is a new establishment I would only hope that it will get better."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with family.  The noodle I had was kind of maybe okay.  I am not too sure, because the noodle was not as chewy as I am used to, yet the broth was okay.  It was not too salty.  Oh yes, it is kind of expensive.  This I am sure.  Services was very iffy.  We sat at a communal table.  The server put on our bill the charges of 4 other customers who sat on the same table.  I raised the issue, and the server corrected it immediately.  He and 2 other servers apologized profusely.  I hope the billing issue will resolve when staff become more experienced.   The experience of this one visit is 2.5 stars.  Yet this place is too new to not give them a chance to work out the growing pains.  They get a 3-star rating from me but observing."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my friend Tony on a weekday. It wasn't very busy, so we were seated quickly.   I've been to many of the downtown ramen restaurants and the menu for Touhenboku was minimalist compared to those. For example, all the ramen options required extra charges i.e. Extra $1.50 to change from chicken broth to pork broth or to choose the miso soup base as compared to soya sauce or sea salt base.   The food came slower than other ramen places, probably due to less customer turnover and the place being new. When the food came, the soup broth was not as hot as I had wanted and for the price charged, there was only one measly piece of pork belly. Furthermore, the soup broth was also very oily. My friend ordered the spicy soup base and a thick film of oil quickly solidified at the top.   We also decided to order dessert and chose the Mille Crepe, however, was told that it was sold out along with all the other desserts beside the Japanese cheesecake. Therefore with no other choices we ordered the cheesecake. When it came, it looked nothing like the picture in the menu (which has some sort of blueberry and whipped cream topping).   Overall, I would not come again as there are a lot of way better ramen places."}
{"text":"I had been eating at Touhenboku many time at different locations before. I think they do a very good job at quality control. It tasted the same to me, not the best, not the worst.  The price is a little high for the portion that they give you. There is a combo that you get a bowl of rice with toppings + bowl of ramen but then you're going to pay $16+ including tips and tax. Not really a good deal.  I remember a couple occasions that I ended up eating there because there's no ramen place around and I was craving it.  Taste *** Price ** Portion **"}
{"text":"Similar layout to Sansotei Ramen in Markham. I thought the food was pretty average. The pork belly was just too fatty. If the fat was melt in your mouth then it would be acceptable but for me it was just too much fat to swallow.  I got the meat lovers ramen $13. You get 4 slices of meat. I chose 2 pieces of pork shoulder and 2 pieces of pork belly.  A regular bowl of ramen goes for $10.50 which only comes with one slice of meat. They also charge you an extra $1.50 if you want miso soup as your base soup flavour and $1 extra if you want pork broth instead of the standard chicken broth. I really think this is just a money grab because I did order one bowl with the extra options and could not tell the difference.   Also tried the takoyaki for $5.50 - pretty average once again."}
{"text":"Came here twice.  The takoyaki is great, though take this with a grain of salt as I haven't had it anywhere else.  The fried chicken is unique.  The noodles are filling. The \"Spicy broth\" is intensely mild, but you can add spices.  The prices are reasonable.   The service is good (They can speak Japanese and Mandarin as well)."}
{"text":"So there aren't that many ramen places in GTA, but they are very slowly popping up as the years go by.  Stopped by here just before their lunch time close, which is at 3 pm. (They reopen again at 5pm for dinner service  - so just a note - in case you want to come by here for a late lunch.)  Touhenboku is known mostly known for their chicken based broth, they do offer the pork based broth (extra $1.50 charge).   The menu is quite simple and streamlined. They offer Ramen - 4 base noodle set start at $10.50 - which includes your choice of broth (chicken or pork* base, noodles type (thick or thin), flavoring (salt, soy sauce and Miso*) and meat choice (chicken, pork belly, pork shoulder); there are options, Spicy, Original, Black (garlic) and light.   Appetizers are basically one price $5.50, same with the donburi. I suspect that here are limited options due to the fact that they're still in opening mode, so there are a lot of kinks to work out. We originally wanted the gyoza, but ended up getting the takoyaki instead due to lack of availability.   Service-wise is ok; when they are serving you - they are quite polite. The only thing I would say is that there is a break between 3 and 5 pm every day; so keep that in mind if you're walking in for a visit in the late afternoon. They did end up turning people away, but I think it's because the sign isn't very clear and it might help if they locked the door at 3 pm, so to avoid the explanation. Also, things are a bit awkward for dining in, if you're hauling around an infant car seat like me and there really isn't much room to put a stroller or a car seat; we ended up putting the car seat on the floor while we ate.  Overall, Pretty decent ramen, not the best I've ever had and with the limited availability of options regarding the other items does detract a little bit; but it will change as time goes on and they find their groove. My main caveat is the fact that there really isn't that much seating to help accommodate a baby in a car seat comfortably."}
{"text":"First review of 2016... I'm so slow on this haha sorry! Here we go!!! This Ramen place is somewhat new! Located Bayview and major mack which is close to my gym holllaaaaaa. Haha anyways the decor inside is very simple yet cozy. I don't really like their seats though.. there's no back and I would like to lean back occasionally without the fear of falling.   The food doeeee hmm the Ramen portion is quite small... probably the smallest I've ever seen/eaten. Pricy too for something of a small size. Definitely was good but for you $ you could probably get something a lot bigger. The appetizers are good. The takoyaki we got was nice and had more then 1 piece of octo which is blessssss. The chicken poppers are hella deliciousss and sauce all day!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for 4 and decided to try this place out. It's a chained ramen restaurant with different locations. For the price of $46 plus tax and tips total $56. We got 2 donburi, 4 bowls of ramen, 2 sides and two desserts.  Idk if it was because of groupon but they told us we only had 2 of the sides to choose from and the slices of cake was a bit tiny.  The ramen was mediocre the meat was kind of dry. The donburi was actually really bad... the rice felt like it was left over rice and the texture had harden on top but they covered it up with the meat.   The sides we got, the potato and fried chicken. The Fried chicken was not really crunchy but the potatoes were very hot and fresh.  Asked for the desserts they were a bit smaller than what I expected but for that price I guess that's what you get. The cheesecake was very delicious but the other slice was a tangerine flavoured Millie crêpe and it tasted a bit weird.  Also we had to ask for water, the waitress wasn't too attentive. The weren't rude but just not much service provided. The seats were quite uncomfortable as there's no back rest so you couldn't put your jacket. However they did have a coat rack.  I guess if you live uptown and really crave for ramen m, this place will satisfy the craving; but definitely not the best."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my prior review to 5 stars.  Been trying the ramen in the area and these guys give an amazing experience, lots of options, and in house noodles."}
{"text":"Really enjoy eating at this Ramen place. I always get the black garlic with thick noodles!!"}
{"text":"Touhenboku is a nice, snug restaurant on the corner of Majormac and Bayview. The food is decent and there is a good portion size but the ramen prices are very expensive.   I spontaneously decided to try the spicy ramen but it just tasted like the regular broth with a slight touch of hot flavour. (This is probably because it is the spicy seasoning is just laid on top). The chicken was nice and flavourful but there were only 2 slices. My biggest disappointment was biting into a COOKED egg, the gelatinous egg that is usually laid over top was NOT cooked to my liking.   My friends got karage don and thought it was, fresh and crispy. However, the overflow of the chicken and the small bowl made it almost impossible to start eating.   Overall, there is good customer service with the waiters coming around to pour water every so often, as well as giving good suggestions on what to get. If you stop by, I would stick to the original broths."}
{"text":"I noticed that one of the popular downtown ramen chains had opened up a location in my neighborhood so I decided to give it a try last night. I was very surprised to see that it was almost empty when we arrived, as it IS the holiday season.  The inside is very spacious and minimalistic..there are many blank walls and the kitchen area is very empty aside from the exposed shelves at the back used for random storage (which is not visually appealing).  The menu offers a variety of options such as karaage, donburis, build-your-own ramen.. picking the soup flavor (white, red, black or light), soup (chicken or pork, pork was extra $1), noodles (thick or thin), meat (pork belly, shoulder), etc.   I had the red (spicy) ramen with pork shoulder, thick noodles and sea salt. Upon receiving my bowl of noodles, I was surprised to find ONE single piece of pork shoulder, a marinated egg and a handful of noodles... very steep for $10.50.. (corn and other toppings are available to add on for ~$1+).  The broth was pretty flavourful and very creamy, the noodles were meh; nothing spectacular like what I would have expected from Sansotei or Kinton (they weren't very chewy...I'd say more like spaghetti consistency).  Overall, for the price and the portions given, I will not be coming back although it is one of the only ramen joints in the area."}
{"text":"Took me long enough to visit and I am glad I did!  Went on a quite afternoon for lunch. I showed up before three but my server didn't mention the special. I didn't realize there was a lunch special until after I ordered which was unfortunate. Other than that the vegetarian miso ramen is delicious, I would definitely go back for more.  Next time I will ask for the lunch special."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that I haven't written a review for this yet.  They have a killed Miso Vegetarian Ramen. There is a slight spicy kick to make it all worth it on a cold night. Staff are friendly and attentive.  This is a great date spot and can be a really great night.  Definitely a staple if you are in the Richmond hill area."}
{"text":"Here's the thing.  I have been to Japan and I know my ramen.  Texture-wise, they were bang-on.  I have always liked a chewy noodle, cooked, but chewy.  The broth was bland and thank God I asked for miso otherwise it would have been very uninteresting.  It was not terrible - and the vegetables were fresh.  I had the chicken-don on the side and I did not care for the taste of it at all.  I wish they had not even brought that as a special offering.  This place has one problem.  My personal belief is that they may be \"adjusting\" their seasonings to the local palate.  Keep it authentic - re-adjust your seasonings!  My spouse could not even taste the garlic in his \"garlic flavored\" soup.  The portions are small."}
{"text":"The place is alright, pork broth soup is good and flavorful, ramen is average, but the pork is a bit disappointing - it is a bit chewy.  However it is good to have ramen place north of hwy 7.r"}
{"text":"A decent ramen option for the neighborhood. I liked the concept of a build your own ramen, you get to choose your soup base, noodle type, seasonings, etc.   The waitress was a bit concerned that we didn't want seasoning (they offer a seasoning option, sea salt, soy sauce or miso paste) but we usually find most  ramen to be on the salty side so we passed. Once we got our ramen and tasted it we realized why she insisted on seasoning, she explained that they do not add any salt or seasoning to their soup bases so we asked for some soy sauce on the side. With the soy sauce, the soup was better however it now tasted strongly of soy sauce so I'm not sure what the best choice would have been, maybe the miso option would have been best but that's a $2 up-charge.   We also had the karaage don which was delicious. The chicken was crispy and flavourful and the rice was seasoned nicely.   While the flavour was not as rich or pronounced as other ramen places, it still hit the spot, the meat and toppings were good and I'd go back to try the chicken base which is supposedly what they are more known for.    The service was good and the restaurant is clean with communal style bench seats and long wooden tables, also some booths on the sides. Prices are on par with other ramen places, same with appetizers.   Not my first choice for ramen but if I'm craving it and I don't want to drive too far, I'd definitely go back to try some other options from this place."}
{"text":"Brand spanking new location to add to the growing influx of downtown-turned-GTA ramen establishments.  Same owner as the Touhenboku @Queen&University with a similar menu.   It's a mid-sized shop with 6 \"couples\" tables and 4 group tables.   If you've been to the downtown location, you know the familiar noodle and broth textures - creamy broth and nice light ramen noodle.  In fact, after speaking with the owner, they bring in everything from the downtown location!  It's a customized menu so you get to choose virtually everything you want in the ramen bowl.   The home made dessert (the crepe) tastes nice, light and great after a nice bowl of ramen.    The service is excellent, almost over eager since it's the grand opening week here and it will be great if they keep it up.  Will come back for my ramen fix any day."}
{"text":"Ramen- good ramen place for a neighbourhood ramen. Broth was a good consistency and flavourful. I've personally had better ramen, but for this joint it's pretty good! Ordered the original.   Service- was mediocre. It was a little on the slow side... but overall just okay.   Would probs come back if I craved for ramen in the area, but would personally make the trek do a different ramen joint if there was a choice. (Just a personal preference). Still a good joint! But had better!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot better than their other location at Yonge and Eglinton. I had a bad experience there and was a little hesitant to come here.   This location is spacious since it's up in Richmond Hill. They had a student special going on - you pretty much get a free pop along with your ramen ($10.99). The cute thing is, it comes in these classic bottles! The service was very friendly.   I tried the black garlicky with chicken. This is better than the pork because there's slightly more meat. I really liked the flavor compared to the spicy one I tried before and really enjoyed it. The broth, however, was a little salty for my liking but, hey, that's for all ramen places. I also tried their chicken karage, which I thought was average.   The cakes that they serve here are wonderful. I especially liked the mille crepe cake."}
{"text":"I need to go kfc after , portion is too small for male and I think an instant noodle taste better."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Touhenboku Ramen.  The restaurant is very modern and small. I came at an off time around 5:30pm so it was before the dinner rush with lots of empty tables.  I ordered the black ramen with garlic oil.  Seasoning I picked pork broth, soya sauce flavoured with thick noodles and pork belly. I also ordered the chicken karaage. The pork broth was delicious! Overall a yummy dish.  The chicken karaage was a little pink inside I took a bite and was afraid to eat anymore.  It was not as tasty as the chicken karaage at other ramen places I've been to.  The service was great. The waitress was always coming to the table to give me water and made sure I had everything I needed.  Could be because the restaurant was empty. Lol All in all glad I tried since I frequently drive by and always wanted to try it. But compare to the other ramen place this was ok.  Although compared to other ramen places this one is cheaper at $11.50 for a bowl of ramen.  Also they give you a stamp card to collect 10 stamps you get your next ramen free!  It's great value but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I got the spicy ramen with pork shoulder. Pretty tasty but the price is on the high end."}
{"text":"This is probably the place to go to if you have a sudden ramen crave. Ordered a the white ramen w/ pork soup, thick ramen, and pork shoulder ($11.50). The portion was not too big nor small, just perfect for an afternoon crave. The bowl is definitely smaller than the famous chains. The soup was a little creamy? because of the pork bone but definitely rich flavour. I personally isn't a fan of heavy taste so this is a little salty. It also has too much green onion, maybe can ask for less next time. The shoulder was tender, it's like the Japanese chashu. The hard-boiled eggs yolk was cold so you can tell its been marinated and put in the fridge. Thick noodles were indeed more chewy than regular ramen. Overall, I would come here next time but only when I have a crave and don't want to go far  P.S- students, if you have your SPC card, you get 10% off your food item. In my case, it only costed $11.70 included tax and discount"}
{"text":"Soft opening.. But I only got 1 slice of pork shoulder. The eglinton location always gave me two slices. I asked if his was normal at this location to give only one slice, and they said yes only one slice. This is not a soft opening issue.   Luke warm ramen and not enough soup was served (I had to ask for more soup as it was served an inch below normal).   Very family friendly. They moved tables to accommodate our baby stroller."}
{"text":"For a ramen place in the suburbs (not comparing it to downtown places), this place isn't good.  Their menu is based on customizability, but the pricing for adding anything is really not worth it.  The portions are extremely small and broth is pretty bad.  The noodles are decent, but the broth tastes like they are using powdered chicken or beef stock as a base.    I would rate this place higher if their pricing more accurately reflected their food quality, which is low."}
{"text":"This is the third Touhenboku Ramen location I have been to, so I kind of know what to expect. I have kind of glad that Touhenboku decide to open up a location up in Richmond Hill as it is not easy to get a decent ramen up here.   I am though kind of disappointed that there is no special deal like they offers in other locations. Last time I got a beer and ramen lunch special for $12 at their Queen Location. And there are always periodically specials in other locations. But here nothing?!  Oh aside from that 2 bowls of Red Ramen for $16.80 special on that large chalkboard right on top of my head? Maybe I should have order that? A sign that the portion is small that I could have ate 2 bowls?!  Red Chicken Broth Thick Noodle Sea Salt  Pork Belly ($10.50) was perfect as a snack! My single \"sheet\" of pork belly was fatty but paper thin. This must need special technique to able to prep that! Noodle wise it was cook well with a touch of chewiness. Chicken broth not as oily as pork base which I found it A-OK.  The interior is bright and modern. Ultra mininalist and clean. Service is efficient with waitress fluent in Mandarin and English.  Hopefully there will be some special offers in this location soon. Ramen & Millie Crepes? Ramen & App? Something? Anything?!"}
{"text":"Really?  Another ramen place. For any ramen fanatic, i think you would find this place very - mediocre   Tts a wonderful news to have ramen without travelling to downtown and most importantly no line up is always a bonus.  From the soup base, soft boiled egg, noodle, to soup base, not one particular item really hit a home run, it wasnt anything to crave about. Everything was done just right, nothing memorable about that ramen bowl.   One very disappointing fact was to the surprise that they charge extra for pork bone soup base, there were only chicken or pork bone soup to choose from! i thought it is almost a minimum standard to have a pork bone soup base!"}
{"text":"Food wise, I am comparing to all the other ramen places available, this place definitely just stands pretty average. It's a very cute, spacious and clean environment. They have those awkward tables in the middle with the stools so you have no back support or a place to hang your clothes.   We got white soup ramen and the light ramen, first bite was incredibly oily! My lips felt like they were drenched in oil lol. The white soup base was flavourful but incredibly thick, not my thing but could be for others. The chicken soup base was very light and lacked seasoning. They usually just give a few slices of meat, but I have to say the portions are a little on the small side. Dessert was the Mille crepes and tiramisu, which tasted like its from a grocery store."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed... On the more expensive side of ramen restaurants, Touhenboku offers a bland take on ramen that fails to make an impression in a market already saturated with other great options. The place isn't very busy around dinnertime and it's easy to see why when you compare this dining option to some of the other restaurants in the same plaza!  We started with a chicken karaage and fried gyoza. The chicken karaage wasn't overly breaded which was nice, but at the same time, it wasn't crispy at all which was a disappointment. The fried gyoza was crispy and tasty but nothing to write home about.  For the main, I ordered the shio ramen off of their \"Staff Favorites\" menu. The soup base was flavorful and the noodles had a springy bite but that what really brought the dish down were the toppings. The egg was way overcooked; the texture of the yolk was a mix between hard-boiled and powdery. The pork belly was thin and lacked flavor. Both of these left a pretty sour taste in my mouth on a dish that had the proper foundation to be really good!  The end of the meal was alright: they offer black sesame ice cream which can be hard to find at most restaurants. Although even this dessert was not enough to make up for the quality of the ramen that was served.  Touhenboku is a tough pick when there are so many other great restaurants in the area. Likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Grand opening was extremely crowded. They are not very economic With the space they are given. Many people were turned away because of the limited space and long waiting times. They don't even have portable chairs to accommodate for additional diners!  Menu wise, it's nice having a modern oriental themed restaurant in the plaza. The interior design is very elegant and a new touch compared to the tradition stores that operate nearby.   This is a \"customize your dish\" type of place. You can choose between thick and thin noodles, soup base, and toppings. There wasn't a difference between the thick and thin noodles. And there is an additional surcharge if you want a miso base.  Though the food was decent, the restaurant was largely overpriced. With tax, the individual price per meal can be over $18! Portion sizes are definitely not reflective of the price.   Though service was very friendly, as they usually are during opening week, the wait time for the bill was incredibly slow.   Overall, I am interested to see how this restaurant will turn out."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday evening and it was quite busy. It seems very family-friendly, as there were kids at every table. There are approximately 8 tables, most will accommodate 4-6 people. Our group waited 5-10 minutes for a table.  We ordered the gyoza and the takoyaki to share. Both tasted excellent. The gyoza skin was thin and was full of pork filling. The takoyaki had distinguishing pieces of octopus in the filling. It was decorated with fish flakes, which provided an interesting presentation.  I ordered the black garlicky ramen with thin noodles, chicken, chicken broth, and seasoned with sea salt. I liked that the broth wasn't salty. However, I thought it could be more flavorful. The ramen noodles were cooked really well. It had a bit of chewiness to it. The soft-boiled egg had a nice runny center. The seaweed paper was a little too moist. Granted, it was sitting in the soup, but it should have been crisper.  Overall, I thought the food was good. Touhenboku is a great addition to the Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"Came by because of a Groupon deal. Portions are very small. When I say small I mean it seems it's meant for kids. Taste was mediocre (had the white soul base ramen). Only got 1 thin slice of pork shoulder. Ordered the don (ginger pork) was dry and VERY salty. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"For a fair comparison, I will not compare this location to any ramen locations downtown but rather to Sansotei (Markham) which is nearby. This place is noticeably less salty and oily than other Japanese ramen place I have been to. While this is good for more health conscious people like me, it comes with a cost because the broth doesn't taste nearly as good as Sansotei.They cheap out on the ingredients because the entire portion was so small. I don't know if I was extra hungry that day, but the amount of meat, mushroom, noodles and other stuff was just minuscule (comparing only to Sansotei). Just judging from the noodles and pork belly alone, I did not feel like they were good quality. You have the option of adding ingredients like corn and butter for $1.00 per item which is a rip off in my opinion. There are specials like ramen with dessert combo and a student set with a pop. I ordered the ramen and dessert combo and was told I would only get half the portion of the dessert which was understandable looking at their full charge if you order the dessert separately. They did not have the Japanese cheesecake I wanted that day so I ordered the chocolate one instead. It was pretty mediocre and I wouldn't pay extra to order it again.   I really wanted to like Touhenboku more since it's one of the few ramen places I didn't feel sick right after eating, but unfortunately the quantity and quality don't match up to the price for me. Therefore, I will give only 3 stars and probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend at around 2pm and the restaurant was surprisingly bustling. We ordered the $10.50 student special (you'll need your student card to get the discount) that came with a bowl of ramen and a glass bottle of coke.   It wasn't the best ramen but it certainly wasn't the worst. The servings were small and the soup was alright. The pork belly wasn't melt-in-your-mouth delicious, but it was alright. The best part of the ramen was probably the noodle, it was just the right thickness and texture.   Final verdict: If you ever have a craving for ramen in Richmond Hill this is one of the very few places where you can satisfy it. Otherwise, save your money and go next door to Ten Ren for better food and drinks."}
