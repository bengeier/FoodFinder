{"text":"I love this place.  I live in the South End, so when I feel like a having a craft-brew, I take the train into Uptown to the 7th Street Market and I go to Tank's Taps. The owners are two dog-lovers, and are great bar tenders; driving around town, you might even spot 'Tank's Taps' personalized tags--devotion! The other staff are super-friendly and just exude local pride. Love these guys and I recommend everyone stop in. It's a Charlotte classic!"}
{"text":"Tank's is an awesome place to grab a beer after work or if you're in the uptown area looking for a local selection.  They have about 15 local beers on tap and also allow you to buy a 6-pack of your choosing on your way out.  It's a conveient stop since I work in uptown and because they have my favorite beern on tap, Noda Hop Drop and Roll, more and more I find myself going to Tanks rather than another uptown bar.  Their prices are decent and if you're hungry, there are plenty of food options within the Public Market.  Great business and friendly staff, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It felt like we were sitting in someone's kitchen counter. Very close and personal service. I got the peach beer and my boyfriend got the black ipa that tastes like a light refreshing Guinness. It is located in a very cute market. Having come from Seattle recently it reminded me of a very small pike"}
{"text":"Tanks Tap....One of the areas hidden jewels. They're using some of the finest beer from all the local brewery's and it always taste fresh and crisp because of that reason. If you're into great tasting stiff beer... give these guys a chance!!! The servers are very pleasant, attentive and they will make sure your satisfied. Stop by if you're in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of local drafts. Never knew Charlotte had so many local breweries. At least 10 local beers were on tap and they had a cooler as well. It's located inside the seventh Street market which has a lot of local food places and specialty food shops. Very cool market. If you're in the area I would highly recommend and try Pure Pizza in the market.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Laura was super amazingggggg!! She made me feeelllllll like a natural woman. I came in with my tranny friends and she accepted us with our \"long hair\".  But seriously she is so fun and amazing. I hope she is getting paid well. We enjoyed hanging out with her today."}
{"text":"Chill place to relax and have some of most current local beers going...large bar top area to drink at, and plenty of food stops in 7th Street Market..."}
{"text":"Thanks to Tank's Tap now there are even more options for beer in 7th street market.  A U shaped bar with about 8 taps that are always rotating and a cooler of some other nc beers should keep you quenched.  Also, I noticed they had some specialty beers in the fridge ( Triple C's Dude Imbibes yum!) and some non local beer as well.  This is a great place to keep the buzz going while waiting on the light rail"}
{"text":"This little bar is conveniently located in the center of 7th street market. They have a good selection and variety of local beers and ciders. They don't serve food, but there are other vendors in the market who do. My friends and I met here and grabbed a drink  before a hornets game. It was a perfect meeting place for this as it is walking distance to the arena.The bartender was super nice and extremely attentive. If you haven't been, I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Another piece of the great puzzle that is 7th Street Station. Tank's has a decent representation of local craft beers on tap and a large cooler with canned beer. Anyone that has Jam Session on tap is cool in my book. Large screen TV with sports. Nice granite bartop. Good place to sit with your food if all the tables are taken. Great simple idea - great location!"}
{"text":"Always have a great, local beer selection. Nice to be able to grab a drink to go along with the many awesome food vendors in the 7th Street Market."}
{"text":"Hey wow, there's a craft beer bar in the market in Uptown Charlotte.  The beer selection consists of mostly locals..Birdsong, OMB, NoDA and maybe one from Hickory NC added to the mix.  The bar is granite and it's a large square space.

I didn't find the bartender overly friendly.  When I arrived I was straining to see the taps. Little did I know there was a printed menu. Would have been nice if the bartender gave me that to begin with. 

Often the staff just makes it or breaks it for me and this time I just felt kind of Meh, although the beer selection saved it from being a 2-star review. Perhaps it was an off day. It was the day before a holiday and the whole market was busy. So I am willing to give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Just beer, no fuss: local brews and friendly smiles. Stopped in here today two hours after it opened and found out I missed a crazy lunch rush. Thankful for that. With all the other dining options now at 7th Street Public Market, beer is all they needed to be a success. Will be a regular here for sure, and the place will definitely do well."}
{"text":"Just when I thought 7th Street Public Market couldn't get any better... then they go and do this. Insert slow clap here.

Tank's Tap is a little u-shaped bar situated between Not Just Coffee and the new crepe place. A ton of local beers on draft and also some non-draft options in the cooler. 

My favorite part: they have a TV. Caught the first half of the Army-Navy game here on Saturday. Hungry? Grab food from one of Tank's many neighbors in the market and enjoy a beer at the bar. Or, take the beer outside for some people watching and soak up a beautiful afternoon.

Parking tip: the market has a machine to validate parking at the 7th Street parking deck for 90 minutes. Validation is self serve and located next to Bonsai (the sushi place)."}
{"text":"Really awesome concept in the middle of the market with a great selection of local beers. Bartender was a little inattentive, but I'd still go back"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a beer or 5!  I love that no matter what you want to eat inside the 7th street market they'll deliver it to you.   The beer is mostly local and it's always tasty.

The bartenders are quite knowledgable about tastes of beer and what you'll like.   Can't get enough of this place!!"}
{"text":"Walked from southend to seventh street market and worked up a thirst - Tanks Tap was a great spot for a quick beer. 11 taps featuring local breweries and during our visit we found that after 10 purchases/visits you get $5.50 off your next visit ! I love a deal and will definitely return to work on my stars!"}
{"text":"Tank's Tap is one of the newer vendors in the 7th St. Public Market. And a great addition it is. 

Featuring local beers from around Charlotte, I think they do have a great job having something for everyone even with the small number of taps. And even if they don't have something up your alley, they have plenty of bottled options to choose from as well. 

Gorgeous tall bar, super friendly bartender, and you can have your food delivered to the counter. What could be better?"}
{"text":"For me this is the hub of 7th street market because basically I get food from a place and then head to Tanks. They have a decent selection of local beers but it doesn't change very often so this isn't a place I would head for just a beer especially since there are a lot of other options in the area. So if you are at the market for lunch or a very early dinner take your food over to their bar and get beer."}
{"text":"Love a good local beer, this is the place to stop and shop.  The 7th street public market is complete with vendors and a great place to enjoy lunch, grab a few unique things and enjoy time with friends and family it's got something for everyone. 

Now Tank's Tap is a new favorite, great local beers on tap and plenty of other craft beer in the fridge. Staff is fantastic and oh so friendly, grab a beer and order something to eat at one of the great lunch spots and they will bring your order over to you at the bar. 

Sports fan no problem games are on the TV, just a fun spot all around to enjoy a break. Oh and their growler fill system keeps your growler fresh for 2-3 weeks.  Love this place!"}
