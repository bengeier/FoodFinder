{"text":"Really loved the food!  The beef with vegetables was amazing, very tender and the vegetables were perfect!
Great service too!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place. very convenient! Helpful staffs , Family friendly and fast service. Highly recommend for Orange Chicken lovers!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese... Tried the hot and sour soup and took home a quart for dinner.  Had the San siren and Mongolian beef for lunch... Excellent."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service and a good value. The food was tasty and less salty than some other local Chinese takeout. The cashew chicken had generous amounts of cashews and chicken. The broccoli chicken was also generous. It is great to have another good Chinese takeout/delivery in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We randomly stopped here for lunch and we're glad we did. The waitress was very nice and helpful. We asked for a recommendation and she recommended a noodle dish that was fantastic. We had the lettuce wraps for appetizers and they were great. We had our two youngest with us and they really enjoyed themselves as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We happy to stop by Wei Wok Chinese restaurant! Under the new ownership, it used to be Chen's. The food is way better then before. Now the taste of black pepper steak is a amazing. We Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very respectful staff and comfortable environment. My husband and I tried the hot and sour soup and loved it. I had the sesame chicken, and it was super tasty! The best sesame chicken I've ever had."}
{"text":"We came here expecting Chens, we stayed hoping for as good of food. It was extremely disappointing. Good is not good and service is slow."}
{"text":"This place is great. Most dishes are authentic Chinese except for a few, which are Americanized. My favorites includes Ma Po Tofu, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Roasted Duck, Pan Fried Cantonese Style noodles, and Lo Mein. However I wouldn't recommend the Walnut Shrimp (mayo overload) and BBQ Pork (not prepared the authentic way). If you want authentic BBQ Pork, I suggest going to Mekong Palace and ordering from there. The taste/flavor is completely different from what Wei Wok serves and it's more authentic/close to the real thing.

Other than that, this place is great. It definitely puts Panda Express on watch since it's just a few blocks down the same street!"}
{"text":"I work in the complex, and could always use a yummy quick chinese food place! This one is a gem. The employees are pleasant as they come, and the lunch specials are great, food was bomb.com. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our lunch here. We loved it so much we ordered extra to go to share with our family. We tried the orange chicken, Black pepper beef and beef lo mein. All of which I would order again."}
{"text":"We came to Gilbert to check on our daughter's dogs, and then decided to grab some Chinese food.  Saw that his was close by, and the reviews looked good, so why not.  So happy we came!  I have some favorite Asian places closer to home, and some go-to places in Phoenix.  Now we have a favorite in Gilbert.  It's definitely worth the drive.  


Why?  Well, other reviewers have said the orange chicken is great, and my wife agrees.  I got Mongolian beef; I've never had any better than this.  We both got the remarkably inexpensive dinner combos that came with delicious lo mein and rice (rice is rice), and added a cup of soup.  My wife loved the egg flower soup; I loved the hot and sour soup (I also loved the two spoonsful of her egg flower, too.)  Crab puffs were the best I can remember, ever.  Great spring rolls, too.  Since Wei Wok did a great job on these standards, I'm sure they do great on their other dishes as well.  We'll be back -- soon."}
{"text":"Hubby and I did some running around and decided to stop and get something to eat. We were going to go to Outback but decided to come here instead. We were both so happy we did. The food was delicious! Great portions for the price. We both had plenty of leftovers that were just as delicious the next day! Friendly service topped it all off. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were very happy to see that what was Chen's Chinese Bistro is now Wei Wok Asian Bistro which just opened last month. The food is excellent and the prices surprisingly inexpensive given the quality of the dishes and soups we ordered. The service was extremely efficient and friendly. Whether ordering in person or for take-out I highly recommend this bistro for a casual Chinese food fix. Great value."}
{"text":"We were in the area and stopped in for a quick lunch. The waitress was helpful and very accommodating and gave us some great advice. We enjoyed the delicious food and the atmosphere. Would definitely come back again to try some other all-fresh delicious-looking options."}
{"text":"Food was average. Server was rude, inpatient and not helpful.  She was more interested in being on her computer than serving her customers. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"New owners/new staff. Terrible food. Used to be our go to spot for Chinese in the entire East valley when named \"Chen's Chinese Bistro.\" Now the same terrible tasting fare as served in the cheapest/ lowest quality Chinese restaurants. 

Although the menu is mostly similar, the recipes are not the same."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to go here! We were out shopping and missed lunch so saw Wei Wok across the parking lot and decided to give it a try. So glad we did! It was late afternoon so after the lunch rush and before dinner so we got right in without a wait. 

Lets start with the menu. It is typical in the fact that it is divided by pork, chicken, seafood and vegetarian. What is cool though is the dinner menu gives you 2 options: the regular plate or family style. In most instances family style was only $1 more than the standard plate but with 3 or 4 different appetizers and rice options to select. We decided we couldn't handle all the food so got the standard dinner plate-although my friend was kicking himself for not trying it all! Wow the amount of food was still incredible. He got the orange chicken and I got the tofu and vegetables. His first remark about the chicken was it was in big pieces and not the little nugget pieces you usually see in orange chicken. Prior to me ordering I grilled the server on what was actually vegetarian/vegan. She knew every dish, what was in it and what I could or could not eat. Most servers don't know what is in the sauces or soup stocks so her knowledge of the menu was very impressive. 

Both our meals were excellent as was their service. We are telling everyone we come across to go to Gilbert and eat at Wei Wok! You will not be disappointed! And yes, this place will be in our regular rotation now!"}
{"text":"We had placed an order for carryout and it was ready within 15min. Upon arriving, it was dead with no patron's inside, hence the quickness of the order. Our order was fulfilled exactly as ordered and it was Piping Hot Fresh! The quality and quantity of the food was great! I do hope patrons will give them a fair shot of making a go of it, as it'll be our go-to place for Chinese here on the East Side."}
{"text":"Terrific service with a smile, drink was never left empty and the food was AMAZING. Salt and pepper pork for the win."}
{"text":"East Valley needs some good Chinese restaurants besides another buffet. This place is great! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I love this new place. Th server was very attentive. Food were tasty and big portion. My new place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Used to go to Chen`s which we both enjoyed and hoped it was just a name change. Decided to give it a shot and were very bummed from the get go. Chen`s was my go to place for Hot & Sour soup and Wei Wok`s was weak and tasteless. Ordered the house special chicken with what was supposed to be a spicy sauce. Again, tasteless and about as spicy as Thanksgiving turkey and gravy. Service was good as were the prices but we won`t be back. On the hunt again for good Chinese in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We wandered in after doing some shopping and were really pleased with the food and service. We had sizzling black pepper chicken and orange chicken - both delicious. Prices are reasonable and the server was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night the server was really attentive and nice they have awesome chicken egg rolls my favorite Chinese restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere, service and food. A must for anyone who loves Chinese food."}
{"text":"So this place used to be Chen's China Bistro. I liked it then but the meat had too much breading before. The food is way better now, the dinner combo was about $11.50 a person for meat, egg roll, crab puffs, rice, and noodles. I ordered the orange beef and my husband had the general's. It was way more than either of us could eat, so we had the rest boxed up and now we have lunch for tomorrow. Waitress was super nice. If wei wok stays this way, we will be back all the time."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken I've EVER had! I'm from the East Coast! Washington DC to be exact. If you know anything about the East Coast you know we have our share of Asian Restaurants in every city from New York to Atlanta. So I've had my share of Orange Chicken....hands down this is the BEST by far!  The flavor is spot on. Very Fresh!  I wish I had asked for a bit more spicy heat. Other than that this is a must try!

Oh and the service was awesome as well. Very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"It was actually very good. I loved the fact my chicken was only lightly breaded. Great flavor. The crab puffs were ok; not as good as the rest of the meal, which was surprising. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Exceptional!  Our favorite Chinese in the west valley was Wok Wei in Goodyear but a sixty mile drive through Phoenix traffic was not very appetizing.  We \"Yelped\" for Chinese near our new home in the east valley and Wei Wok popped up (they have only been open a month) and we thought we'd give it a try.  If Wei Wok was as god as Wok Wei we'd have great food just minutes from home.  Well it was even better and we'll be back!  Excellent food, reasonable prices, and superior service.  Wei Wok rocks!"}
{"text":"Great service...quick and food was still hot when they delivered it to my house. Yum!  Food was awesome!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've had a hard time finding really good Chinese food this area.  I'm is glad this place has opened.  High quality food and great service.  The only down side is that my husband wished the kung pao was spicier."}
