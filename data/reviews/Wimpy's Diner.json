{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. The food always comes quick and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, I've been here for a few times and every time is great! They have a huge menu with choices to cater for everyone. You cannot go wrong with their all day breakfast options from big breakfasts & pancakes to loaded omlettes made just perfect. I recently came with some friends and we all had an excellent experience thanks to the quick service from both the waitresses and cooks! The waitresses actually pay attention to every detail, my friend got a burger with fries and whilst talking almost ourselves he said he would love Chipotle mayo... Well guess what? One waitress ended up bringing some! Awesome service, I guarantee your cup won't ever be empty and neither will your stomach once you've eaten at Wimpys. Get the Philly cheese steak or try out their specials like the beef brisket (Wimpys Texas style) their portions are quite generous, I'm 6\"5 and I always leave with a full stomach and a smile on my face! Amazing/5"}
{"text":"The food was passable, but not great. 

The service was horrendous. With people at three tables, the waitress acted like she was being run off her feet. She got my food order wrong and, to top it off, she dropped the bill on our table without bothering to ask if we wanted dessert.

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Working in the food industry when you get a Sunday off you enjoy it. So today I decided to drive from my place in downtown Toronto to Wimpys diner near Sheppard and Bathust area. As I don't eat pork I love the Turkey Bacon option. So today I went to order the pancake combo and was told that I couldn't sub pork bacon for turkey bacon because the kitchen doesn't make substitution on the \"signature dishes\" the dish is pancakes , eggs , bacon and sausage how signature is this. Love to meet the creative chef that came up with this complex dish that it can't be modified. So I had to settle for the classic that comes with the turkey bacon option and no pancakes , not gonna pay for two dishes. I'm a chef of a busier restaurant in the financial district and if any guest of mine asked for any modification it would be done and if my cooks can't handle that in a rush they would be fired. 
I will not be returning to this location and I hope the servers are more friendly and not quick to shut you down. She did nothing to try accommodate my choices and was just no. 
Hope rest of my day off is better"}
{"text":"A couple hairs on multiple occasions ruined my experience :("}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast Sunday morning. The staff is polite and friendly, but they're understaffed for the weekend rush. We sat at the bar for about 10 minutes till we got a booth. The food came to us fairly quickly. Average food. This place is reasonably priced and you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less. It took us a while to get our bill, and the staff apologized for the wait. 

The place is not the cleanest diner I've been to, and could definitely use an update. 

Overall: Very average experience, not one to be remembered. Will I go back? Most probably not."}
{"text":"This Wimpy's location is as good as they come. Great food, very friendly and effective service, pleasant patrons. We usually come for weekend breakfasts - gotta have them pancakes! Also the sandwiches are always good (try The Griller). I even tried their huge burger for breakfast - juicy and delicious, but had to skip lunch afterwards :-) Kid friendly, too."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice now.
Both times the service was friendly and quick.
The first time I had a huge portion of breakfast with all the expected classics. Breakfast is available all day, by the way.
This time, I had their huge famous Wimpy's hamburger with a side of onion rings. It was delicious.
The ambiance is 50s or 60s diner and is quaint and fun.
I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a good old fashioned meal."}
{"text":"I've only been to 2 restaurant locations.  The first one was awesome down by Yonge and this Bayview one was awful.  The server that I got was rude and judgmental.  I ordered for my family who's English is very limited, but she kept on looking at my family members to place their own order.  The attitude and tone spoken was sarcastic.  I changed seats and she complained that it confuses her.  She holds up the plate for us to catch our own instead of placing it on the table.  Almost hit my face with the plate because she was too busy saying \"hi\" to customers.  Just plain awful.  I don't see how two seniors that I went there with would deserve this type of service."}
{"text":"3 eggs over-easy, a hamburger steak and home fries is what I had and I was very happy with the food and friendly service. I will go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Dining at this establishment is the exact kind of experience that makes you want to get home and write a review.

The staff were very friendly, the atmosphere funky and retroesque, but the food was utterly repugnant. We ordered two burgers with fries and onion rings and drinks. One would expect that for over $30 worth of food one would be receiving something fresh [and I must add I was not expecting a healthy dish considering we were at a diner after all].  Our drink and food order arrived promptly. The burger patties tasted as though they've been in the freezer for a very long time. The bun was the kind filled with preservatives to appear appetizing and the fries and onion rings tasted like frozen. food service products. 

I always wonder how restaurants who serve such unpalatable food stay in business. The only reason I finished my food is because it was 5 pm and it was my first meal of the day. If I were not hungry I would not have eaten after the first bite. 

If you are interested in eating fresh and homemade avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I have a predilection to roaming the night owl options.
it just feels peaceful.
oddly enough my very fervent wish is to find a place that hosts a fairly good crowd during the wee hours.
In Argentina, in the city of Rosario. There is a 24 hour internet café/snack bar that I would sometimes go into at 10pm and emerge at anywhere from 3am-sunrise
That was one of my favorite places ever.
The endless options of online games and the convenience of food at the same place.
anyhow

I happened upon this 24 hour diner.
it was practically empty at 10pm
but picked up and up, and soon at 11pm it was about half full.

 the food was well portioned, the potatoes were just...meh
not bad. but felt out of place taste wise.

pretty good stuff"}
{"text":"We've been there twice, once for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and once for deserts on a weekday evening. We had steaks and burgers and they were so delicious. Apple pie was average but if you crave for sweet, it's good enough. The waiters were polite and fast. I am glad we have a diner like Wimpy's in your neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Now that's what I'm talking about! A classic diner chain. Almost all of which, unfortunately, disappeared before I was born. Perhaps the most exciting part about this place is the decor: old movie posters, coke ads for 5 cents a bottle, and all that good stuff. The interior, I can imagine, brings back memories for many, however I found it a little small for the crowd it draws. Adding to the nostalgia aspect, I ordered a vanilla Coke, something that I haven't had in a long time. Two thumbs up for that. Also, great service. Everything arrived at our table promptly, and the sever was very friendly. 
Anyway, the food was pretty good. We all had the classic Wimpy burger, complete with the toppings of your choice all on top of a golden brown bun and a side of crispy fries (or onion rings, if you're being picky.) Although the sandwich was full of flavor, I found the patty to be lacking somewhat; it was a little thin and paper-like, and as John G. mentioned in his review, \"pureed pressed\". However, the fries were amazing: crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and very addictive, as all good French fries should be. 
Overall, four stars. Dock one star for the patty. Not too concerned about the size of the establishment, but remember not to bring too big of a group."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really cute!  I liked the decor very much and our waitress was decent and friendly.  I ordered the 10 oz burger and some fries.  Why is the patty a weird shape so it doesn't fit properly on the bun?  It made it very awkward to eat and the bread fell apart as I was eating which made an even bigger mess.  The meat itself didn't really taste like anything.  The amount of toppings they put were laughable.  I mean seriously, the tomato was cut so thinly I can see through it.  I get more toppings and better quality at Harveys to be honest.  The plates were very small so the amount of fries I got was very little.  They were good just needed more on the plate.  I'm very sensitive to MSG or anything similar, it gives me a headache and makes me very thirsty.   Within 15 mins of eating my meal I got a headache and couldn't drink enough water.  If it's not MSG they use then it's something else which is similar.   Anyway, I will not be back.  I think I enjoy a burger from Harveys better.  I don't get why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"Not the worst breakfast I've ever had but close. Nothing was seasoned and everything tasted off, like the oil was rancid or something. The prices weren't bad and the service was fine."}
{"text":"first, we got a table that was highly uncomfortable, the seats felt shitty that we were/felt sunken in....space is cramped....just not comfy at all...

and food sucked..  i ordered a eggs florentine... equivalent to a vegetarian eggs benedict, basically the same hollandaise sauce....but it was o so shitty...

my friend ordered a club sandwich... the bread looked like whole wheat wonderbread..

{"text":"Wimpy's is good, but not great.  No real complaints, but it has to be above average for me to give it 4 stars.  I will say that the kids seem to love this place, and enjoy the shakes they make.  We've been for breakfast and dinner on separate occasions.    Service is always excellent.  Table side jukeboxes don't work which is a big disappointment for the kids!"}
{"text":"If what you're craving is the classic beef dip, then this is the place to get one! Soft ciabatta bun packed with shaved beef and a tasty au jus to dip it all in. No fancy mayo, sautéd veggies or cheese. Just the classic diner style beef dip. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a great experience after reading the reviews. The hamburger was your standard frozen patty heated on a flat top. Through the pass thru window you could see the cool eating while preparing your food. My server was super pleasant too bad the food and the cleanliness of the diner didn't match. 

Being in the restaurant business here's some advice:

Get rid of extra clutter
Clean the kitchen so it shines 
Give the place a fresh coat of paint. 

You want more customers today than yesterday so do something for new customers.  Your existing ones will maintain your sales. Your new ones will propel your sales. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"Melody the server is awesome. She is very attentive and a great person to talk with. Her attitude is just wonderful. The service is always great and friendly And the food is delicious. I recommend this place for lunch anytime."}
{"text":"Over the past almost-20 years, we've been to this location well over a hundred times - although the exact total is probably somewhat more embarrassing. The bottom line is that although the food is unexceptional, it's always good and it's always at your table in short order - Dino seems to consistently hire fast and friendly servers. The prices are good, the coffee is excellent and the decor is ... well, who really cares about decor in a diner?"}
{"text":"Wimpy's offers amazing breakfast ... whole day long! We went to this joint few times and never got disappointed ... two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had:

French toast combo ($10.79): 2 slices of French toast served with 3 eggs, 3 pieces bacon and 3 sausages.  Sausages were good.  Other than that, everything else was average.  Rating: 3/5

WIMPY'S Five Star Combo ($11.29): 3 eggs, 2 pieces of peameal bacon, 2 sausages and 4 pieces of ham served with home fries and Texas toast.  Home fries were okay, sausages were good. Rating 3/5

Huge portions.  Tight booth seating.  Good retro look.  Food is okay.  Good for brunch on a Sunday."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for a good old fashioned breakfast. Maybe not the healthiest but so good just writing this makes me want to go there tomorrow morning. While not un-friendly would be good if they recognized regular customers a bit more and were a little more involved in the community."}
{"text":"Food is decent but don't expect any smiles from your server!!! 

The place is cramped and they want you in and out in 20 minutes so they can stuff in the next guy. 

Nonetheless, it is popular for a reason. Grease and spoon good. Coffee wash down. Ahh."}
{"text":"I love wimpys for breakfast, this is by far the best looking one I have ever seen, from the retro red sparkle seats, to the art and media on the walls. 

Had breakfast, the hashbrowns were sliced instead of cubed not what im used to from wimpys, but very good nonethless. Bacon and sausage were great,as was the rest of the food.  I will probably never give a 5 star but I know my customer experience was a solid 4

And I saw its open 24hrs...."}
{"text":"I just visited Wimmpys at Dufferin and Steels with my friend and my sister. Icould not believe the friendliness of the staff. The food was so good.  This is a new Wimpys and I'm sure it'll do great.  seeing all friends from different restaurants ,just enjoyed my day, food and service. 
Glad to see that Sandra the waitress from Pancers was working There and seemed so happy at this location...
Thanks Sandra for taking me down memory lane...."}
{"text":"I was actually headed to Yogurty's to get some fro-yo but decided I was hungry and needed to grab a burger instead.  I was surprised to see how busy this place was, and it appears to have a committed group of locals that come here regularly.   The food wasn't anything that wasn't expected, but I can't say it was great food.  The burger and fries were okay.  There is nothing here that I would rush back for, but it did the job when I was hungry.  I did find the burger pattie on the salty side, and other then that it was okay.  Would I recommend, probably not if there is another option."}
{"text":"Don't put Open sign if you are not open !!! 

We went there to have an early breakfast on Friday morning in January around 6 in the morning. They have winter hours sign on the main entrance. Even though it being a Friday and they should be operating to their regular hours, I. E. 24hrs.. there wasn't a soul in that diner. I called them twice, to ensure if someone is in the bathroom would come to get he phone and knocked on their door too. We waited for 10mins and left. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I love going here for breakfast when I'm in town.  This location has really friendly service every time and I find the prices to be reasonable. 

Sure, the coffee isn't the greatest in the world, but it's a diner - what do you expect?  Great atmosphere and decent food, works for me.  I've tried a couple different breakfast options with no complaints at all.  Also, I love that they have a turkey bacon option.  Service is usually pretty quick too, even when it's busy.  Always a great option if you don't mind tasty diner breakfasts (I've heard the burgers are good too)."}
{"text":"After several visits to this location over the last several months...
Consistent:
Exceptionally friendly and prompt service. Very good food, and it is prepared fast and served hot.
Awesome soups. Huge, quality burgers. Daily specials are a good deal. 
Haven't tried any desserts because the meals have always been huge.

Highly recommend this restaurant location."}
{"text":"So here's a breakdown of my experience:
- There was rice inside my drink! The dishes are obviously not being washed properly.
- my potatoes were extremely dry. The food is obviously not fresh.
- 6$ for 4 strips of burnt bacon!
- Grilled cheese arrives at the table burnt!
- Servers are gossiping and disrespecting one and another in front of the customers!!!
- Grill cheese + Chicken club + 2 egg breakfast = 50$. Way to expensive for very low quality food.

Overall: Not worth it!"}

{"text":"I'm used to diner food in the US and Emily's is right on par. They're open 24 hours now which is awesome and usually everything that I get is pretty good. Mediterranean wrap, and onion rings :-). The only downside is that the place is really small. Only 10 or so tables and it's fairly narrow. Still, I'm sure I'll come back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Wimpy's Diner once in the US many years ago and so I decided to try it in my neighbiurhood because it is almost across the street from the other similar restaurant that I frequent. This was March of this year.
I had ordered take out over the phone their \"New\" flash combo because it came with 2pcs each of peameal bacon, sausage and regular bacon, When I went to pick it up (paid) and just as I was about to open the bag to check it, the waitress immediately said \" everything is in there\", so I went home. The dish was ok, not great. However, I felt truly ripped off because the most expensive meat- 2pc peameal bacon were missing! I called and I was told that they will put my name on the \"manager's board\" so that when I return, I would be \" re-imbursed\" but the server did not indicate if there was a deadline. Two months ago I decided to go back with a friend to give it another try. I mentioned the screw-up \"take-out' incident to the manager who said that it was too late and that I should have returned within 2 weeks of the incident. The manager did not even offer some kind of small bonus (such as couple slices of tomato or free coffee) to win me back as a customer which I would have done if I were a manager. This visit,  I had ordered the eggs benedict, value-wise -disappointing -small portion, so-so taste;  not worth the $$ compare to the one at Sunrise café & grill\" across the street which I just went to yesterday and overall is still consistent."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have breakfast. Decor is cute and the food is also good.  3 eggs are the standard but very small of course.  Lots of parking available and the service is very good.  Been here for breakfast only but will try lunch soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting just like disgusting one nasty fucking place stay very far I would rather eat rat fetuses then this places food."}
{"text":"Nice and close to home!  The decor was dusty and the restaurant was kinda dingy.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was OK.  Ordered the Greek salad with a grilled chicken breast.  Portion was good, however, the Greek dressing was not.  Way too much oregano and very oily!  I prefer creamy Greek dressing.  We will come back for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Went to Wimpy's Diner. 50s type place. Ordered ten oz burger with fries and coke. Ok, nothing special. I ordered everything on my hamburger. The other guy got onion rings, which made me jealous compared to my lonely French fries. Meh."}
{"text":"Been to 3 Wimpy's diner ( one:  in Maple or Vaughn, Yonge St. N of Hwy. 7, but particularly enjoyed this one in 2900 Steeles St. E. & Townsend / Donmills Rd. ) 
This local has a very quiet mall ambience and if you're lucky pretty good WiFi conn. In Most spots but esp. Good near Small Shopper'sDrugmt.  If you get bored, you can always go shopping at The Sears depot or descent but smaller Food Basics grocery local.  There are several sitting areas inside / Even OUTSIDE, not many malls are as equipped!!! Convenient by car or Transit.  Any ways, here's my review. 
  Small but quaint Wimpy's 50 /60s style decor.  
Had them make a special meal voiding my typical allergies. They made me a grilled chicken, sate fresh veggie ( broccoli, carrots, corn, no peas dish ) with rice dish.  Thought portions were abit small, I guess with my petite stature they didn't think I had a good sized appetite esp. That day!   
  Good juicey sized burger and it's there regular sized burger! $6.95 served with a fresh large kaiser crusty bread ( cannot compare to Wendy's, which are very good as well. Couldn't start to finish & took it home.
  Service was friendly helpful genuine but not so knowledgeable about their simple menu. Kind of odd since I passed there many x's ( saw the same oriental waitress  last 6 weeks and finally decided to go in? )  I guess I am only person who has particular food sensitivities who's gone to Wimpy's ?  Wheat / gluten and dairy mixed into their ground beef?  Anyhow, they thank God DONOT."}
{"text":"It was pretty good I went with my family. very large portions and really nice service. If you do order anything with gravy be prepared to get a lot of it."}
{"text":"Liked it better when it was pickles but the service is good not impressed with their changing their menu using sliced lunch meat on clubhouse sandwiches reasonably clean  still can't get rid of that smell in the basement of the bathrooms. Overall friendly and inviting"}
{"text":"Brand new Great place! Breakfast for dinner at 9pm. Super friendly staff. Good service."}
{"text":"Food was passable but expensive. But it took longer to get the burgers than to eat them. Service was terrible... and it was not even busy. Will not visit this burger chain again."}
{"text":"Can we say trashy?
Blarring tv, kids screaming cold eggs and complaining waiters

Used to be good about 3 yrs ago and all the noise and drama was worth waiting in line on a Saturday for the food but the food got terrible too. 
One i sat behind 4 drunk guys at 1130am and the waiter just went along with it. 
If you wanna feel like dirt trash in the am come to this place, the surrouding Plaza with its 'interesting' ppl will get you in the mood."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went today, I had the Wimpy omelette and she had the classic breakfast.  I have to say, we loved it.  The food was served quickly and was piping hot. The servings were large and the service was great, very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast, my husband went in while I was looking for a parking spot,  he asked for a table for 2 and was told that the restaurant's policy is not to give a seat to anyone who is waiting for others to join them.
 The waitress  (Rose) who greeted us by the door was so extraordinarily rude,  actually calling my husband a liar. After that we refused to deal with her and we asked for another waitress to serve us. We  also asked for the owner, but he was not in.  Breakfast came fast and tasted good, although my poached eggs were swimming in water, other than that everything was ok. The girls who served us were nice and tried to make up for  their colleague's bad behaviour, but the experience with Rose was so disturbing that  it ruined our Valentine's breakfast and even other diners around us had commented on her unacceptable demeanor and language. We decided not to return."}
{"text":"Large menu of choices. Prototypical American style diner food. Breakfast thru dinner is covered  here. I stopped in for dinner with the family. Decided to order the 10oz burger and fries. This burger is HUGE! Restaurant is clean. Service is fast and friendly. Was a little warm. Felt like air was off. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Worst. Steak. Ever.
Dirty floor....like, there was a tomato slice on the floor when we arrived and it was still there almost an hour later."}
{"text":"Being a local business owner, I frequent thus location often. The food is always good with value for the portions. I often during a hectic day call for a take out order. The order is always hot and ready when I drop in to get it. The wait staff are rushed but pleasant, and friendly."}
{"text":"This location is very small so be prepared for that.  Food comes quickly but they never seem to get the order right.  Better to visit the other Aurora location."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and this morning, my cousin decided she wanted to go out for breakfast so since there's one just down the street from us, we decided why the heck not. 

The place was pretty empty so I got seated right away and was asked if I wanted a beverage while I waited for the rest of the party, so I just ordered the water. But once the rest of my family came, the service level just dropped. 

Not sure if it was maybe a language barrier thing but the waitresses weren't very friendly especially for the type of casual atmosphere Wimpy's brings out. They would either rush us to place our order or would be walking away while we were still speaking with them. What makes things worse or complicated is that we're with an old grump (my Aunt),  my cousin who is a server herself, and I myself is in the hospitality industry. Still, we kept our cool and were still courteous. My cousin noticed that the server only started to be nicer when we were pretty much done eating and were ready for the bill. Welp, the server didn't get a good tip, that's for sure. So service-wise, I'd have to rate this place 2.5/5.

As for the food, portions were great considering the pretty affordable prices. One thing though is that for a glass of apple juice for kids, refills should be complimentary or at least lower the price (it was $2.99). I'd rate the food 4/5 since I'm still waiting for the honey I asked for and the coffee we were served was barely warm. 

There's an Eggsmart across the street so you may get better service there or maybe at Ted's Restaurant off Old Kingston Rd."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favourite Wimpy's locations. The food is always so fresh no matter what time you come in.
They have recently made this location bigger, which has made it a bit slower. This is really not a big deal though because there slow is still pretty fast!  
Parking is pretty tight in the parking lot but you are always able to park fairly close. Overall its a great experience"}

We ordered the burgers and fries and found the Oval patty greasy but dry at the same time. The fries were low end frozen 

If you are craving a burger & fries or diner food..there are a few other options in neighborhood that give you better quality"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years it has always been consistent with food and service. I love that they offer turkey bacon! Only thing I don't enjoy are their home fries."}
{"text":"Surprisingly it's pretty good. It's a little diner type place, you sit down and order. 

I got myself a burger and fries. The burger patty is football shaped, it sticks out on both sides of the bun. The beef is actually surprisingly tasty, certainly worth trying. The fries were good too, with gravy, it's good. 

It's not very expensive either. Pretty decent meal at a pretty decent rate. If you're a fan of diner type foods, then you'll probably love Wimpy's. Really cool decor inside too, really retro. On a final note the stave was really attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Love the cute old style diner vibe of this place. Good food, service and vibes. The food is not to die for exceptional but it is good. I've had the burgers, fries, onion rings, burgers and wings before and they were all really good. If you get fries or onion rings, I recommend getting their gravy, it complements their food well. Their burger tastes like a nice home-made style burger, it's classical and leaves you feeling good about your selection. I went here for breakfast once and I was not that impressed with their omelette but their waffles are great. I definitely recommend coming to this place, overall it is a good pace to grab a bite and catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Not EVEN 1 STAR!!

Went for breakfast/lunch and VERY DISAPOINTING. 

Sat a table noticed some sort of food spot/stain on the table, asked the waitress if she could wipe it, she did but didn't even remove the stain because she barely pressed the cloth to the table and the nightmare begins...

Ordered: 
Coffee, Ice Water, Coke, Bacon & Eggs, Ceasar Salad, Grilled Cheese with Ham, Fries with Gravy

The coffee was disgusting, water did not come with any Ice (even though I specifically asked), but the Coke came with a glass full of ice, go figure?

Although the fries and gravy were to my satisfaction, the Eggs & Grilled Cheese had oil dripping from it! Seemed like everything was cooked all together and looked like the oil has been reused. The salad had char marks from the grill and to TOP OFF THE EXPERIENCE a HAIR WAS FOUND sitting under the salad!!!

We are dearly paying for this!! GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten at wimpys occationally over the years and have to say that the last cpuple of years it has sucked; pancakes today were so chewey to be unedable.  Burgers have been the same.  Coffee is watered down and bland.  Service is generally fine though recently i had to overhear a senior waitstaff chastising a new girl for being late. I think im done now with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood, and saw this on Yelp, and my husband, son and I gave it a go. Kind of sketchy on the outside - didn't look busy, and when we got in it was completely empty. But hey, we're brave, so we went for it. We were all happy we did - the hamburgers are SO good. Not fine dining, but serious comfort food (and come on, most comfort food isn't fine dining anyway). The onion rings were out of this world! Service was really great - very friendly waitress and the owner (?) chatted us up a bit as well. 

We were all stuffed or we would have given the apple pie a go. Because, honestly, when the burgers, fries and shakes are this good - you just know they serve a fine piece of pie. Definitely on my list of favorite comfort food locations."}
{"text":"Came in here a couple of weeks ago to order take-out as I was craving a burger. I stood by the cash register for about 5+ minutes to order my meal with several waiters passing by. No one stopped to greet me or anything. Then I saw one of the waitresses standing behind the cash register in the narrow aisle texting on her cell phone while I was directly in front of her without being served!!! She didn't even look up or notice me!!! Or just plain ignorance...

I finally had to flag down one of the waiters to get their attention. I asked a young man, \"Can I order?\" In which he responded \"Yes, hold on\". After a couple of minutes, he took my order. 

I would have left after standing there for a while but I was really craving their Jr. Melt which was delicious. That's the only upside."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice. The portions are pretty big, and the staff is pretty nice. Sometimes the food comes a little bit colder than it should, but not so bad as to be a deal braker. 

I usually go there after waking up with a hangover, just to get my head back in shape :P

Also a really cool thing you can do there is for $0.25 you can select and listen to a song from your table!

They also did some major cleaning and minor renovations recently, so its even better   than it was before.

YAY WIMPY's"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for brunch/late lunch and it was great! I ordered from the 4-egg omelette menu (veggie omelette) with home fries and a side of cinnamon bread (i may be wrong about the bread, it's on the extra sides menu if you're looking). 

It's a small place with a couple of 4 seater booths and a couple of 2 seater ones and a bar but the service was prompt. When we got the food, our table couldn't fit everything! haha but it was very filling and I didn't finish my omelette. The home fries are so delicious! I felt like I was eating a whole carton of eggs.. greeassyyy!

It's about $10~pp, so definitely wallet friendly! Since it is a smaller restaurant, it does get loud fairly quickly, but I guess that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch.  This restaurant was busy.  My server was great.  I had corn beef hash with eggs and toast.  The corn beef was a bit spicy.  Next time I will order something else.  Their portions are generous.  I couldn't finish it all.  This restaurant was very clean.  It is small.  I have never had to wait for a table.  Their prices are reasonable.  I had to wait a while for my bill which was not a big deal."}
{"text":"So great eating here late at night when nothing else is open. The never can you go wrong with the pancake"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times. Loved it. Food was always good, portions are large and service is nice too.  I don't expect fine dining presentation and butler service. this is a diner so you need to come here expecting that and you'll be amazed when you'll get more."}
{"text":"Short and sweet today, I've been meaning to review this spot for several weeks as it is my GOTO spot after the gym for a healthy breakfast. I know I know I'm a terrible person for reviewing this chain for a second time BUT the owners here are lovely, the staff is super friendly and this is one of the best run locations of this chain that I have been too - bar none!

My order as of lately has been the Early Bird Special. I tell you one thing you truly don't feel like an old dude until you're up early enough on a weekday for an early bird special. Plus the crowd in there is something to marvel at - Honestly how do the elderly rise this early??? I was in at 8AM and it was packed to the teats....on a Tuesday!!!

I slightly modify my early bird special at a slight extra charge, I opt for the egg white scrambled eggs and turkey bacon with little to no hashbrowns and only a single slice of Rye toast - Ya you wish you were as healthy as me! In fact adding an extra white of egg is an additional charge as well but well worth it in terms of portion size difference for this growing boy. 

My only criticism is their coffee. Sure Wimpy's you're a diner but I overheard the staff mention a change in coffee providers and I noticed the difference...hollow flavour, almost plastic....bleghhaaa. please bring back your old brand :)

See you Thursday morning for my bacon and egg whites again :)"}
{"text":"Twenty minutes wait. One moody waitress. Two hungry kids. Add them up and what do you get? A terrible experience start to finish. The waitress took our order, the place got busier rapidly as we came at 5:30. By 6 we gave up and told her to cancel our order because the two cooks were busy cooking a large take out order and so everyone in the diner sat and waited..... And waited..... And waited. When I said I'd like to leave the waitress handed me a $6.50 bill for two 6oz (flat... As in no fizz) fountain drinks. I don't care if their burgers are the greatest thing in the universe...... This place is the last place I would ever go to again."}
{"text":"A nice variety of food and all-day breakfast is nice.  However, I went there on lunch and got back to work late.  Service wasn't slow per-se, but it's not good for those on time constraint.  Still, it's great for groups who all have something different they're itching for!

Not good if you have allergies, though.  They may have changed it since I went, but I notified the server of my food allergy, but she didn't check with the kitchen to see if there would be an issue with my meal, so I got pretty sick after."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great service at great prices. What's not to love? My husband and I took our three sons and their friends. We all loved our food and the service from the waitress and the cook were amazing."}
{"text":"I was here once for brunch, and even thought the place was half-full, it took us an hour to get ours meals which were very ordinary."}
{"text":"Read the reviews which were really mixed and we walked in expecting crappy service but wanted Wimpy's Breakfast...we won't be back.

We waited for over 5 mins at the entrance with another 10 people while the 4 waitresses joked, ate toast, checked lottery tickets and were hanging out at the bar. It wasn't until a little girl threw up behind us on the floor and the father asked for napkins that the waitress came over and said oh just find any clean seat. 

We sat down near the middle near the waitress station. Within about 10 seconds this middle aged lady with long curly hair in a pony tail started bashing customers. Her exact words about this Asian family were \"I don't want them sitting there as I will lose out on a table that will actually tip me\". She continued to talk badly about people, her family and being loud the entire breakfast. 0 stars. 

Our waitress with short hair was actually really nice and had good service and very friendly. I would give her service just 5 stars. 

Food wasn't good. The eggs Benedict sauce had no flavour and both the homefries I had and my wife had were soggy in the middle and burnt on the outside. I had them at other locations and they are usually good.  1 star for food.

Edit: so you took the time to review how long I took to get food and eat and leave. Ya 35 mins sounds about right cause all we heard was waitressing complaining so we wanted to get out of there 

It is nice you commented but you didn't address any of the waitress behaviour. Good luck with your restaurant as I won't be back."}
{"text":"Arriving at any Wimpy's no matter what the time of day, the question in my mind is always \"Do I do all day Breakfast OR the burger\"? Yes of course they have a scrumptious menu prepared to grease any spoon into submission, but for my money its either a) or b).

For those of you whom have never had the pleasure of visiting a Wimpy's (aptly named after the cheap, scheming burger Barron friend of Pop-eye), its the perfect place for a quick meal any time of day. The staff is warm, local and usually reminds me of my Mom or a cool sweetheart aunt. 

The décor in my mind is the tops, small malt-shop style booths with tons of quirky road, vintage coca-cola and movie signs, clutter the wall amidst 1950s memorabilia (looks like a James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis fan club had a field day in here).

Aesthetics and ambiance aside, lets get back to the real draw here: Foods! Ill be sure to review the breakfast menu on a follow up review some other time, but my lunch yesterday made me full, sleepy, and smiley and I must tell you all about it. 

I ordered the Wimpy's Famous Hamburger Combo (ordered a Coke and a Greek Salad) w/ Bacon and Cheddar cheese on top. The burger naturally comes with all the fixin's: lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, may, mustard, relish, but none of that matters when the burger arrives. An 8 inch long OVAL burger pattie protrudes a solid 2.5 inches on either side of the already sizeable sesame seed toasted bun. 

The SEP (standard eating procedure) for these burgs is to nibble your way around the meat until you hit bun and work away from there. I've near failed at this bodacious badass burger on several occasions, but always have found the will to push through and pack it in.

The last item I wanna rap about is the unexpected value of their Greek salad. It was the first time I had ordered it, and aside from not properly preparing the iceberg lettuce (it was a tad chunky for my liking), the portion was hearty and there was so much feta cheese that my bowl looked like a feta cheese salad sundae. Delish. 

Lastly, because Wimpy was such a cheapskate it would be a sin to make his signature meal pricey. Total meal cost was around $13 +tip (thats with adding cheese and bacon)

Dining here will never leave you spouting Wimpy's once famous line \"I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a Hamburger today\"

NOM :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years. Always consistently delicious food. Try the eggs benny.  It's also a very popular spot. Parking is tight, so park next door next to the paint place. Expect to wait a few minutes for a seat, as the restaurant is smaller than other wimpy's in the GTA. Trust me it's well worth the wait. Very cool old timey feel to this place. Posters, plackards and jukeboxes are on the wall. Staff is quick and helpful. If you're not in a rush and you want some great comfort food, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Steak sandwich and fries were great!!! Service was good. The dining area could be cleaner and makes you wonder about the cleaniless of the kitchen."}

Nearby Mercury Diner has far better food and nostalgic decor."}
{"text":"I come here for the poutine and massive burgers, the servers are very nice and although the parking lot can get pretty hectic (Metro/Shoppers) its worth it every time."}
{"text":"It's good breakfast place or hamburger place to eat in or dine out so give it try when your here the service is very good"}
{"text":"Had the most stressful meal here due to the old grumpy waitress with the weird blue eye shadow. 2 people from our party of 5 was 10 mins late and that waitress kept on coming over to give us attitude, saying: \"are you gona order or what?\" There were other empty tables in the restaurant. She gave more attitude when we said we wanted to split the bill in half.

Food was in smaller portion than other diners and the taste was just average.

Will never return."}
{"text":"Here's my mantra in my business dealings... it's not so much that mistakes or mishaps will happen (because they will), but it's how a business makes it right that counts for me.

Today my wife and I went to Wimpy's after a bad experience at another diner (we walked out when we thought we were being ripped off on account of a deceptive menu price practice).  We were hungry, and in a foul mood.

I ordered the big breakfast, which comes with four eggs.  I had mine scrambled.  I am 99% sure that there were only three eggs on my plate.  I flagged down the manager and asked her if it looked like four eggs to her.  She didn't blink an eye, argue with me, or screw around.  She simply asked the cook to do another scrambled egg asap, and it arrived inside of two or three minutes in a nice little bowl with courtesy and grace.   I was supremely impressed!  That is seamless service to a customer concern.  

Outstanding!  The place was crazy-ass busy at the time, and there was a line-up out the door, but it was clear that this manager was keeping it together upstairs, and was calm and in control.

The food and service was also great from our waitress.

BTW... re. my last review... there is really nothing wrong with the trek downstairs to the bathrooms.  It's a very lovely well-lit catacombs.  Like many Toronto restaurants, the stairwell to the bathrooms downstairs are just always steep. :-)    Not much you can change there.   I still wouldn't do it after a few beers, though.  Very clean bathrooms, for the record.

Definitely coming back, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. We could've had our coffee refilled more considering it wasn't busy. Food is pretty consistent, you get what you asked for, and it arrived in a timely manner. We both got the Southwest Eggs Benedict. The homefries were bland, but the eggs were fabulous. 

Location was clean and had 3 different sizes of booths. Like all Wimpy's locations, they only have booths and stools at the bar."}
{"text":"This deserves a zero stars! Stay away from this dirty \"restaurant\" that hire servers with attitude. We came in as a group of 9 to enjoy a late breakfast/lunch - everything was great until we met our server. Here's what went wrong - food took a very long time come to the table and it was cold. When we told the server she yelled back saying that's how it comes from the kitchen. Finally sent it back and they brought it back with a half eaten sausage. There was hair in the club soda and when showed it to the waitress, she claimed that it was our hair. The hair was black, we all have blonde hair or short hair for boys. The place is extremely dirty, the food is questionably and definitely microwaved, and the servers didn't have their customer service training. Won't be surprised if everyone gets sick after the epic meal fail."}
{"text":"Went with 3 other people and we were all unsatisfied. The service was very slow and on top of that, the food was cold and not tasty at all. They burnt the bacon, overcooked the eggs. Don't recommend it"}
{"text":"Great service, fast and friendly. Simple food, but tasty. Generous breakfast portions...try the Twist... 3 eggs, bacon and sausage, toast and a mound of home fries."}
{"text":"its a fast food 50 and 60s style diner we come for all day breakfast .. we think reasonable meet friends here on the weekends... its just ok what do you expect its a diner?"}
{"text":"Amazing and friendly staff with great breakfast. Clean and fresh ingredients. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wimpys is a classic diner. I love the old school vibe here and the booths and juke boxes they have in each section! ( to be seen and not heard so I hear!) they have a great early bird special for only about 5 dollars before tax! Which is far and few nowadays . The portions are huge and well worth your money's worth! Service was very friendly and knowledgable about the products.. Thank you for recommendation for the sausage and home fries with my eggs was deeeelicious!"}
{"text":"The Owner needs to get a grip on this place fast .The service here has really taken a turn for the worst, our so called \"waitress\" had a horrible attitude the way she talked to us & those other customers around us, was ridiculious & the service as a whole was just plain slow & bad. What a shame..... and yes, the place was pretty empty ( Tuesday afternoon )  This place needs to go back into its past & rethink everything,what happened to that happy, light hearted atmosphere that was Wimpy's ? ..... they went 99% of the distance with the decor .... but seriously, why unplug  the Jukebox setup; really dumb - ( uh that kinda was the whole idea of having it there .... REMEMBER ? Please,  no more ....playing this  trendy new garbage tunes through the lousy speakers - JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER JOINT ( Oh, it's more \"Popular\" .....- DUH - NO !!! - What made Wimpy's great & what can once more, is Fantastic food, service & the feeling of being in a happy 50's diner !!!!  Bring the good old music back & lose the old hag prison guard waitress with the issues -Head office needs to adjust the training - do a makeover - increase the fun factor & increase the profits  - This place was one of the best family restaurants; it could easily be again - Listen to your customers & don't hesitate - you'll be glad & so will we   :)"}
{"text":"Sandwiched amongst a chorus line of eateries in the Queen/Torbram area is Wimpy's Diner. I've been there a few times, and depending on when you go, the experience can vary.

Service has always been up and down for me. There was a time when I was the only one in there, and would have to wait an eternity for the waitress, and at other times, they've been prompt and awesome.

The interior is your typical 50's/60's diner-style setup, complete with the little mini-jukeboxes that will faintly play \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\" and other semi-annoying gems if you feed it money. Typically I'll play \"Monster Mash\" and twist my mustache sinisterly, while I wait for my food.

The menu items I've sampled have also varied significantly in quality. The breakfasts were especially disappointing. I haven't tasted the more expensive dinner items out of fear, and the sides flat-out stink. How do you screw up fries? Yerrgh.
The one menu item that earns this place a 3-star place in my heart is their zipper-splitting burgasm-inducing slice of heaven that is their 10oz hamburger steak. So seriously delicious. The impossibly hot chick of 50's diner burgers, I'd give this thing a horizontal hug if I could. 

Not much else to see here. There is a little bar, but I'll be damned if I ever see somebody actually take advantage of it. This location also appears to have set up a patio just in time for winter. Good job guys!

So there you have it. A couple of somewhat decent menu items, a glorious burger, and booths that can only seat 2 and a half people. Little people of the 50's, rejoice!"}
{"text":"Great service and a real nice lunch served. I'm always happy to dine here as I don't visit often , it's a treat when I do."}
{"text":"I was recently notified that Wimpys has reopened and is under new management. I look forward to dropping by real soon for a meal."}
{"text":"There are nice diners, and there are cheap diners, and this one is the latter. 
Today was my second time coming here, and it made me remember why I've only come once before.
The first time I came many years ago I ordered the pancakes, which were nothing special and overpriced. 
Today I got the chicken fingers with fries. I got the dinner version because it comes with coleslaw, an extra chicken finger, and garlic bread. The chicken fingers were fine (those are pretty hard to mess up), the fries were awful, and not even salted. They also forget to put ketchup in my bag, so I had to go back (even though I asked if everything was in there including the ketcup). The coleslaw was decent, and the garlic bread was nothing special. $14.

My particular server was nice, and I happen to know it was the kitchen that forgot to give me my ketchup. However, the other server that I spoke to momentarily had a bit of attitude. While I was there, there was also a guy who came up to the front to get water because he had been waiting for it for over 10 minutes.

Overall, if you are craving low quality diner food that is overpriced for what you are getting, this is the place to go. I expect that people who don't have much expectation for diner food, service/atmosphere, would be okay with this place, but that's not me."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot when I was younger. It's in a convenient location, easy to get too and it's small and quaint. It's got several tables that can sit up to 4 people, some two seater's, and the bar area. The service is excellent, and though I've only tried their signature burger combo (which is awesome by the way) I would definitely go back to try some of their more dinner like meals. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We checked out the web site and it said this location is open till 10 pm. We walked in at 8:30 and was told they were closing at 9. Sign on the electric sign on the window said open till 9:30. I went in to tell them their sign says 9:30 I was told by the guy we will take care of the sign. How rude. Ended up at East Side Mario's. Your loss"}
{"text":"Foods great and it comes very quick. My husband and I have never had complaints about the food. 

You do have to get there early or there will occasionally be a line - especially weekend mornings!  

They do try to sneak in up sells (for example cheese in your eggs) without mentioning costs. But overall the waitresses are friendly, warm and they stay on top of refills.

The decor is always great in wimpy's diners, they're entertaining, great convo starters and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Brunch rocks!!! 
And brunch at Wimpy's Diner rocks too!!! 

I ordered the latest addition to the breakfast menu, the corn-beef hash combo. And boy did it hit the spot! 

Be sure you bring your appetite when you go to Wimpy's. On top of the generous serving of corn-beef hash came an abundant amount of potato rounds (alternative to home fries), 3 eggs and 2 pieces of toast. 

The 50's & 60's decor gives you that true old school diner experience. The friendly staff made sure our coffee cups were bottomless and their clever wit made our experience even more memorable. 

Simply unbelievable value for the price point.

I would have rated this location a 5, but my toast was overly buttered and our fruit was stale. Therefore a solid 4 it is!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is clean, but I found the food very greasy and unapeeling."}
{"text":"This place is classic Wimpy's. Delicious, gigantic burgers and friendly service. I've only gotten takeout here for work and they have always gotten the order correctly, despite everyone's special requests.

The space looks like an old retro diner and is pretty busy during weekday lunches.

The food itself is what you'd expect, nothing mind-blowing, but satisfying."}
{"text":"This is THE ORIGINAL store that the franchise was modeled on!
Before they became a chain, their burgers were REAL homestyle, (like ones you might make at home from ground beef) not pureed pressed patties like they serve now. **There was NEVER A BETTER BURGER!**
Otherwise, this is where the huge servings and motif were copied from!
It's a really small place, lots of 'regulars\", and they had daily dinner specials. The cooks were the owners!
This was at LEAST 15 years ago, and really needs an updated review.
'fact I think I'll make it a point of getting back there real soon.
P.S. I AM SPEECHLESS THAT THIS ICON HAS NEVER BEEN REVIEWED!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you are craving some traditional diner fare at 2am in North York? Drive to Wimpy's! 

They have a good selection of burgers and sandwiches. The chocolate milkshake is awesome. The service is typically above average. You need to trek down a long and dark hallway to reach the washroom in the basement. And if you come during the afterhours, there are always some interesting crowds for people watching. 

What else would you want?"}
{"text":"The real greasy spoon diner concept. Fun place to pig out. Large portions and a reasonable price. Not for the diet or nutritionally concuss. Staff is very friendly and helpful. This is a family owned restaurant and it shows in the attitude. Try the liver and onions. They got it right."}
{"text":"I try burger at each place. So i got one of their burgers, it was a huge patty making you slobber at first sight. However the size doesn't add much if the quality is down. 

If you are a quantity over quality person, that is your burger."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a big weekend breakfast. You just have to get there early cause sometimes it seems as if most of Newmartket like it as well. Portion size is ample and the food is delicious. It's not fancy high dining just solid diner/greasy spoon fair. Great service from old fashioned waitstaff that are friendly and helpful and call everyone \"Hun\". Prices are reasonable and you do get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Love the vibes I get from the place. The price isn't too bad but the food was a little bit greasy for my liking."}
{"text":"First time dining here and food was pretty standard fare.  There's a good variety on the menu...all-day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, steak, fish and pasta.  I found portions were a bit on the modest side.  Pretty standard diner taste, nothing noteworthy.  There's ample dining room with a very oldies diner ambiance to it. Not bad for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"If I could give this location less than one star I would. The customer (dis)service is the worst I've ever encountered. Maybe I'm too polite a customer and should have spoken up before waiting twenty minutes to ask why I was being ignored. 

Other suckers, I mean customers were being served and their plates removed. New people were coming in and being offered service, and yet there I sat, in plain view and no one came near me."}
{"text":"On occaision i pass this place and think about dropping in so this time, i did.
Some love it some hate it, so i had to see for myself.
I have come to this conclusion, its edible, but lots of food does not mean great food.
For the price its fair trade, but the burger was dry, the fries were greasy, but a big portion.  I guess it depends what you are into, and this aint it for me.  
Now its a been there done that situation.
Its just OK and thats the best i can say.  for $10 i got what i would call a decent meal, its just that if i compare it to the burger i had on the weekend i would surely pick the other place if given the choice and i was in the area.  
But, I had to try it for myself.  I came, i saw, i ate, i left, I lived.  However I wont be craving a return."}
{"text":"We arrived here around 12:20PM on a Sunday afternoon and waited around 20 minutes to be seated. Wimpy's was packed and had many people enjoying different meals. We were given menus and the kid's menu to order. My sister got the Flashback combo and I got the Five Star combo. The Five Star combo also came with two warm pancakes. The service was great and I was surprised how busy it was. All workers looked busy trying to run the restaurant so koodos to them. I found the food was freshly made and the eggs were delicious. However, the home fries were bland so I had to add salt. Even so, they still tasted bland. The food was okay maybe a 7/10. I would not return because I do not think large breakfast meals are my thing but service is definitely excellent. In addition, the washroom was super clean."}
{"text":"We were there for breakfast this morning. It was not busy.  We waited a few minutes to get seated and given menus.  We waited 15 minutes and left. Nobody wanted to take our order. The servers seem to avoid eye contact with us. It is just Macy's all over again with diner decor. They need to work on their customer service. They do not have that great a location either."}
{"text":"The portions here are massive but the prices are great. My family ordered this huge burger steak, vanilla and chocolate milkshakes, fish and chips, and chicken tenders. Food wise, it's nothing memorable, it tastes similar to other diners. The decor is pretty cute though."}
{"text":"Typical American-Style diner with way too many options but I'm just here to talk about breakfast. 

The portions here are 'Merica friendly (HUGE) with prices to make here a choice when waking up feeling like splurging on a breakfast outing 

I decided to order (Via SkipTheDishes) and they promptly fired my order timely to when the carrier arrived prompting a decent delivery time while the food was still fully cooked and warm/hot/anythings better than cold. 

When I finally opened my food I immediately said \"what have I done\" ordering so much food for two people. But that's as exciting as the food gets. 

Upon fest'ing I noticed something was missing in every single bite out of every single individual item, seasoning. Nothing was seasoned at all not even a grain of salt was on the home fries, I ended up using most of the ketchup packets to get thru the bland meal :(. I got extra mushrooms on top of my burger-steak and they were really just chewy flavourless brown buttons, it was kinda annoying trying to get thru all of them (don't waste food). 

With all that being said, id honestly order again or dine I if I ever had a chance but just have salt and pepper handy when doing-so. One thing I did like was the fresh OJ, places that offer fresh OJ deserve second chances

TL;DR : price and portions are generous but no seasoning on food. 3/5 based on food only."}
{"text":"Awesome comfort food. Staff are warm hearted and very friendly. Best breakfast around. Club sandwiches are very big and filling. Just wish there was a bit more space because it's almost always full with customers"}
{"text":"We came here at 12:30 am after a night of drinking, and we were dining with about 3 other full tables and man did the food come quick! Loving this wimpys too, always clean and the service is great too. They know how to make you feel welcomed and this is why I always go back here. Who could complain about 24/7 hours!"}
{"text":"Super busy on weekends, pretty quick though. I'll have been going here for years and years and they finally put an extension in. Amazing decision, there is more room for people to sit and overall just more space for everyone. The chefs always do an amazing job at making sure you enjoy what you are eating. Would defiantly recommend. Just not a place for huge groups even with the rude customers the waitresses never truly show them attitude, overall just a great environment."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday with a friend for lunch. Usually this kind of food is not my cup of tea. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't terrible either. 

It's decorated diner style, which is a culture in itself. My table has an old music player attached to the wall. The servers are nice. We had to wait for a table which took maybe 15 minutes. 

We had the smokey sweet poutine and a chicken shish kebob. I thought the poutine was good. Sweet potato fries make it feel less greasy than regular fries. Cheese and gravy is never bad. I didn't find the meat very smoky. 

The so called shish kebob was a disappointment. I've tried lots of greek souvlaki, Iranian kebobs, and lebanon style kebobs. What Wimpy's served was NOT kebob. There is no smokiness from the meat. It felt like they just stir fried it on a pan. It's not even shaped like a kebob. I was expecting cube chunks. They served thick slices so obviously it wasn't grilled on a skewer. They should have just called it grilled chicken

Anyways, the food was still very edible. The prices are reasonable. Even though it's not my type of food, I wouldn't rule this place out for the future. But I'm not dying to come back."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food definitely worth The visit had lots left over will be coming here again soon"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed coming here for dinner. The server was pleasant and professional.  Food was good and filling. Love the atmosphere  and company there. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was completely ravenous today at lunch, & I was having trouble deciding where I wanted to eat, & what was going to fill me up.  After some deep thought, a neon flash went off in my head, & it occurred to me that I hadn't been to Wimpy's in probably over ten years (mostly because my wife doesn't like it there).  I remembered that they have a monster burger, & just like that, the decision was made.

I went to the Whitby location on Brock Street, & walked in.  For those of you who have never been there before, Wimpy's is a 50's-style diner, with tons of signs & murals on the walls, featuring 50's icons like Elvis, Marilyn, James Dean, etc.

I got there at about 1:30, grabbed a newspaper & sat in a two-seater booth to wait for a server.  There wasn't really a wait, as the waitress brought me a menu (that I didn't really need), & took my order right away.  It was a foregone conclusion that I would be ordering their Wimpy's Famous Hamburger Combo, which is a monstrous 10 oz burger, with fries & a side of gravy.

She brought me my drink & there was only a brief wait before my meal arrived.  Now, when I use the term \"burger,\" it's being used out of convenience, because in actuality, it looked more like a deflated football with grill marks on a bun - only about a million times more appealing.  The burger isn't round, but more like a rectangle with rounded ends.  It completely dwarfed the bun, & looked almost ridiculous.  Beside the burger was a large pile of fries that were so piping hot, I had to eat the burger first.

Since the burger hangs over the bun, you don't really have much choice other than to eat the patty until you get to the bun.  The patty was pre-made & formed, which isn't really surprising, since that's how chain restaurants maintain consistency.  As a result, I can say definitively that the patty was super juicy, flavourful & cooked just right.

Once I managed to eat my way to where the burger actually met the bun, the burger got even better.  The toppings were crisp & fresh, & the burger was so juicy & messy, which was just what I wanted today.  The fries were frozen too, but because they were hot & cooked properly, they were great, too.  The gravy was your standard packet gravy, but it fit perfectly with everything else.  Some people decry frozen food as low-quality or \"not real food,\" but I've been to places that serve \"fresh ground beef burgers & fresh-cut fries,\" but weren't nearly as good as what I got at Wimpy's (cough, cough, STARR BURGER).  If a place serves hot, tasty food, who cares if it's frozen?

At any rate, my meal came to thirteen dollars & change, which, considering the huge portions, seems fair.  This was the first time in a long time that I couldn't finish everything on my plate, so you know that the portions are ample.  Good food, good service & decent prices mean that I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my second time that i had breakfast here. If you want to hate egg benedicts then this is the place to start. I had it and I don't even want to recall the taste or anything. Too much oil and the ham was like gum! But honestly I had normal eggs last time and they were good. And the fatty stuff made my hangover better I confess."}
{"text":"Its Friday night. I was craving something greasy. I grabbed my cellphone and looked for a nearby restaurant and set the filter to 4+ stars rating, $ affordable, and of course free WiFi. Well Yelp suggested this place for me.

I love the decor. Its so old fashion you might think you just stepped out of a DeLorean after driving 88mph! (Speaking of, its 2015 already!).

Now to the food. The menu is huge and has pretty much everything you want from a diner. I ordered their famous burger (picture attached). It came with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, pickles, onions. The patty was too big for the bun which is awesome. Meat was tasty. Veggies were fresh. Absolutely no complains. Service was quick and friendly. I am surely a fan of this diner. Next time I will try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Wimpy's is a franchised diner.  Not all are the same though, since a good diner is usually run by a family or close team of staff.  There are Wimpy's that would get one star, but this location has consistent and freindly staff and decent food."}
{"text":"Service can make or break a restaurant,  especially one where there is a safe, tried and true menu.   The first time I came the service was excellent and the food was delicious.   The second time I came,  the service might have been the most atrocious I have ever had.  She wouldn't even look at us or talk to us,  she gave us 1 menu for 4 of us,  then didn't come back for 20 minutes.  Later she brought coffee with no milk or sugar,  and didn't even bring utensils when we finally got our meal!  You would think the place was ramped and she was overworked... Nope.   It was half empty and she was 1 of 3 servers in a max 15 table restaurant.   I rarely complain but in this case I asked to speak to the manager.   He wasn't even there.... Ie he was at home.  This was last year and I hope /pray they has been let go or smartened up.   Because I would rather support a local business than a chain any day of the week. 

Food was good both times though.  Burgers are big and pretty good!"}
{"text":"You know how he always said \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\"

I can understand why.  The prices at first seem a bit high.  I originally came in wanting to try it but just had a full meal and the curiousity drove me there to try a small hamburger.  I got this giant meal of a burger, loaded for 2 digits on the bill.  The waitress did tell me that they are expensive, but they're amazing.  They're really good and worth the try.

For that price, I did with the bun was warmer. Aside from that, I can understand why Wimpy would have his own burger joint.  It's decently good and the portions are more than reasonable, but the price seems a tad high, which for that, I'd go to Harveys.

What makes this place so amazing is the diner feel and the diner service is very good, once you get a feeling of the place and feel the vibe.  I came at lunch, It wasn't too busy, just a few local customers.

If you do have a big appetite and want to try something different.  Come up to Wimpy's and give it a try.  Next time if I can, I want to try their breakfasts, but this trip, my waistline wouldn't allow it.  

As for the burger, I'm glad I came.  I'd come again for sure."}
{"text":"Wimpy's Diner

So we decided to check out this location for something familiar as we had frequented a Wimpy's in Brampton a few times.  

The service here was very friendly.  This place has a 1950's vibe that at this location looked a bit worn.  It was also a bit dark which did not add to the place.  Some of the plants should be given the heave ho and some of the seats need to be fixed or replaced.  

I checked out Today's Specials after browsing the menu.  

I had, as an appetiser, the plate of onion rings.  They arrived promptly, hot and tasty.  Personally, I could have had a few more which would have made sharing easier as a starter. 

My wife had Club Sandwich - turkey, cheese and bacon.  She liked it along with a side of fries. 

I find with any club sandwich it is hard to avoid over cooked bacon.  Personally   the strip should not be 10 seconds anyway from being bacon bits. 

I also felt the fries were very bland and ketchup did not add anything to their appeal.  Stick with the Rings.  

I ordered the chilli with toasted bun.  However, I was told that chilli was no longer on the menu - even though it was on the white board.  

So as a quick default I had the chicken Caesar large size.  The fillet was done nicely but it was a bit salty.  The salad portion was decent.  Not heavy on the garlic which was fine by me.  

I figure a 3 out of 5 is a Yelp recommendation so as I can't do that for this place so I gave them a 2."}
{"text":"Very poor restaurant. I was pleased to get a table immediately on a Sunday morning. Most places have a wait. Although it wasn't busy it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to come to our table. The food was cold and the server seemed irritated that we were there. It was also over priced. I would give Wimpy's Diner a miss."}
{"text":"Interesting burgers. I've always wondered why in the cartoon the burger that Wimpy eats looks a little off kilter, now I know.  Nothing too fancy about this spot. It's mostly diner type food which would be fantastic after a long night of drinking, however they don't subscribe to the diner hours. My fiancee and I enjoy the burgers and fries we get from this spot, but in no means think they are the best around, just good for what they are. Cheap, tasty, and quick."}
{"text":"We visited Whimpy's  at this location yesterday. Our friend raved about the place so we trusted his judgment. There were three of us. One of us ordered a large salad and had coffee. My friend had some kind of pancake/breakfast special and I had the spinach and feta omelette with fries. Everything tasted all right at the time. However. After the meal I experienced gastrointestinal distress that lasted til the evening. My friend got up during the meal and raced to the bathroom with the very same issue. And what's worse is our friend who suggested the place had gastrointestinal distress after dining there again today. Something in this food is not agreeing with us, the one common denominator we shared was having their coffee with the 10% milk."}
{"text":"Never tried Wimpys diner before but its a typical diner with all day breakfast menu and burgers, salads, pastas.

Being in the area it seemed like all hope was gone for a late night meal until we found this 24 hour joint.

Food was ok. Alfreda pasta with salmon was a bit greasy. Fries are average as well but they sure gave me a lotta gravy which I drank bottoms up."}
{"text":"Wimpy's has been around for years but seeing as I am not a huge breakfast guy ive never been.  Went one Friday for brunch and my eyes went straight to the burger.  10oz burgers who in their right minds would pass that up lol.  The burger was an odd shape.  Oval burger but round bun.  Took me a few minutes to figure out how to eat it when the burger arrived at the table.  After thinking about it for a few minutes i just cut off the ends of the burger and turned it into a regular burger.  The burger was super tasty topping were fresh, perfect amount of cheese and bacon.  Fries were crispy and golden brown.  Although this may not be my first choice to go and have a burger but I will come back to Wimpy's."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. But I'm glad they are still surviving in -AURORA - this place is nostalgic for me as I grew up in Scarborough and used to love it. Let's keep it real - this place is a comfy 50's diner style eatery. The menu is very huge consisting of all day breakfast foods (if you can think it you can image they have it); sandwiches, salads, fish & chips, roast beef...too many to list - oh yeah of course their famous shaped oblong burgers.  It's a real family kind of place, service is friendly and food comes out fairly quickly however it's never packed when I go so could explain the speediness. My food has always been what I expect from a place like this; nothing fancy ,no frills just good value and good taste, not expensive at all; Nothing over the top. As for my recent visit the signs of an aging diner are starting to show on some of the tables & chairs  (get rid of the duct tape)."}
{"text":"I really love Wimpy's diner.  The food is just great and service, for the most part, is attentive and quick.

I've been to this particular Wimpy's several times.  It has a great classic 50's American style ambiance, complete with posters, paraphernalia and non-working jukeboxes.  Some people think that the jukeboxes work because I found a quarter stuck on top of one once.  (I don't check the jukeboxes each time I go though, there may be more stuck quarters there).  The colour scheme puts you in a joyous mood and the all day breakfast is outstanding!!!

I honestly would have given this a five stars, but one of my loves, the home fries seems to have changed.   I so loved the old home fries' mix of herbs and spices, whatever it was that made it taste like amazing home fries, as well as the crunchiness on the outside coupled with the soft texture on the inside. Another reason this place does not have a perfect rating is because, it seems, while seated at the back of the diner, did we not get such attentive service.  I was dying for a coffee refill or two, but did not get any even after I was done my meal and was eyeing all the servers and waving my hands.  So yea, quick coffee refills is really integral to good service.

Anyway, about the home fries, the last home fries I had was mushy and just tasted like plain potato.  I was not the only one who noticed as my companion also commented on it.  I hope this was a one time thing and not a change of recipe!!!

I super love the five star breakfast, but everything in the all day breakfast section of the menu is superb.  Love the corned beef hash, omelettes, pancakes, still have to try the french toast, but based on the rest, I think they would be superb.  Love the coffee, love the free refills.  Love the portion.  LOVED the home fries, that's now like a plain potato :(, but anyway, I still LOVE this place and I will continue going for my breakfast/brunch needs.

One new thing that I guess all restaurants have now and Wimpy's has is the calories listed on the menu.  I wonder if this had an impact on the flavour and texture of the home fries.  Did they make it more \"healthy\" but sacrificed the flavour? Or was it just a one time thing, off day for the cook perhaps?

I will find out as I will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Ajax to grab breakfast. The wait staff is friendly and greets me with a warm welcome. The food is good and service is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"I wasn't satisfied with my experience. It was around 2 PM on a weekday and I was working in Whitby so we thought we'd try lunch at Wimpy's. The restaurant was empty but the server was very slow to take our orders. For $15 I was able to secure a turkey sandwich, a couple of onion rings, and a small fountain pop. The price was a little much for what it was. By \"texas toast\" on the menu they actually meant wonderbread. The turkey was very fatty. I think you'd have to try pretty hard to find fatty turkey breast but they managed. The turkey tasted off, too, I think it was past it's prime. Even though the sandwich is premium priced you have to pay even more to add cheese and you have to ask specifically for mayo because apparently most people relish dry sandwiches. It was something like $4 to make it a combo which means a drink and choice of side. I chose onion rings and got what I would pay .75 cents for at Pizza Pizza. Honestly, it's flour, salt, and white onion, you can give more than six if you are going to charge $4. Anyway, I ate it, then decided to take a washroom break and get back to my day. The toilet was filled with the previous diner's excrement and wouldn't flush. It was a nice end to the meal. I won't go back."}
{"text":"OMG

How did I live in the area (Thornhill, Concord) for 20 years and never know about this place and instead go to Mickey D's for late night cravings. 

I missed out big time. 

Finally got to try and I was impressed. 

tried some sort of breakfast combo and all in all was pretty good, 

Would try again and will be seeking out GTA wide Wimpy's on the late night tip for sure!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't eat here because of a recent review. Glad I ignored it.  We had good service and food was exactly as ordered. The restaurant and washrooms were clean. Was a little pricey for plain breakfast but can't complain."}
{"text":"The food portion size here is òk compared to other locations.. some day they have very friendly staff guess it depends on the day and how busy they get. I usually get the flashback breakfast or their roast beef meal which is very good..
Flashback combo comes with 3 eggs 2 bacon 2 sausage and 2 pemeal bacon I usually change the pemeal into one sausage and 1 bacon so I get three of each and comes with taters I guess you would call them even if their photo show medallion potatoes and 2 pancakes which are always fluffy..
Roast beef meal comes with sliced roast beef on top of a Texas toast smothered in gravy which I go crazy over and has side dishes of mashed potatos (or you can get fries or rice) I prefer the mashed potato and steamed veggies.. if you have a big appetite I suggest getting those two dishes  they will for sure make you full.. 

But today I tried something different got there wimpys famous hamburger meal same like roast beef but minus the toast and come with a 6oz or 10oz burger with grilled onions on top.. and my boyfriend got the famous hamburger  with onion rings and a side of poutine..

Again depends on the day you come how busy and what mood the staff is in to get the really friendly service.."}
{"text":"I always get their FLASHBACK BREAKFAST COMBO or the ROASTBEEF MEAL they have a very nice size portion of food and friendly staff.. so far they haven't let me down with the taste and quality of food or service.. I love going her with my lil one cause he enjoys the food and it's the type of food he likes"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service totally blows. Great breakfast menu. The ladies washroom was clean when I visited and I was greatful for that. The overall place was well kept but I can't get over the craptastic service and I'm saying this from 2 different occasions with 2 different servers. The ladies weren't attentive at all. We had to ask for everything from condiments to refills. Once our food was served, its like they forgot about us. I'd go ago if I was asked to but I wouldn't pick this place."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5/5! This is a small but great little diner. I don't think i've been to a wimpy's diner before. Each booth has a neat little music player (that doesn't work btw, don't put your coins in it!). A note to everyone ordering: portion are huge, american portions i would say. The breakfast options has 3 eggs and the omelettes have 4! Why anyone would need so many eggs at once i have no idea why.

I got the junior burger melt (crispy sandwich with melted cheddar, caramelized onions and burger), it was really good! I looked past the grease and artificially spongy meat because i was starving and I needed just that after exercising. Our waitress, Melissa was great- really attentive and perky!

I think I'll try the pancakes or share a dish with someone next time. Probably want to try a different location too."}
{"text":"Old school diner, what a beautiful thing! Wimpy's diner is a throwback to the era of diners and drive-in movie theatres.  I wasn't borne at the time, so I don't know what it was like, but going to Wimpy's gave me a little sliver of that, and I think I liked it! 

Wimpy's diner has all the elements of a diner, the bar stools, booths, and even the old school jukeboxes on each table.  At first my friend and I didn't know if they were just decoration, but found out that they were the real thing! Excitement took over us and we were grooving to Jenny on the Block in no time! 

I ordered fries, typical diner style fries, and my friend ordered a milkshake, which he seemed to quite enjoy.  Our food came super fast, mainly I think because the diner was closing. But the waitress never rushed us or made as feel like we were inconveniencing her, when we clearly were.  

I'll be coming back to Wimpy's shortly, for a full meal this time... A blast to the past."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and each time I had a good experience with the staff and food. 

I ordered breakfast each time and it was good for the price. Their lunch and dinner looked fine from the tables around. 

If you come on a weekend you will wait for a table 

Price was 8-$12 for a big breakfast"}
{"text":"So conveniently located across the street from my place I go often and often say I won't come back but I do. Had some good experiences but 1 or 2 really bad ones. Ordered 2 poutines one regular and one cheeseburger poutine and it took no joke, 35 minutes. Got home, the wife loved the regular as usual. But my cheeseburger poutine was made with mozzarella, no bacon on it and had chunks of cut up frozen hamburger patties that were still cold. 
If you go, get the all day breakfast. They have great variety with a huge menu."}
{"text":"I love this spot anytime I'm in town and looking for a morning bite. The food is always consistently good, the staff is always super friendly and it's a fun atmosphere with all of the 50's & 60's memorabilia on the walls."}
{"text":"Pretty unenjoyable experience. Went Saturday 1030 am and realize this is the peak breakfast time but after being seated and waiting 15 mins we had to get our own menus. Waitress went by seemingly purposefully past our table every time. Getting coffee took forever. Taking our order took forever. By the time we got the bill and were able to leave it was almost 1230. 
I guess their \"all day breakfast\" means you have to be there the entire day to have it."}
{"text":"It's hit and miss. They're open 24 hours so that's a bonus. Sometimes bacon is super crispy, sometimes it's nearly raw. Some staff are nice, some not so much. When the food is good, it's good and it's fair for the price."}
{"text":"This place is good for quick cheap eat. If you come before 10 am you can get their early bird special. Mine was $5.99 and it came with 2 large pancakes, egg, and a meat (bacon, sausaage, or ham). Quality isnt great. But portions are big and filling which price is cheap. It's not really clean and service can be quite slow."}
{"text":"Food was simply ok. Meat loaf was dry as was the beef in the beef dip sandwich. Both looked like a reheat from the day before. Gravy, as well as the au jus for the beef dip, was way too salty.

Burger was uninspiring and small for 6oz. I expected better after reading the glowing reviews. Otoh, service was quick and friendly.  +10 for ambiance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply horrible.
The food is blah, the beer is luke warm and I would never attend again.
Stay away"}
{"text":"Just a plain ol' place to have a quick meal or all day breakfast. I had the liver, which is bread and then friend. It was very tender and delicious. It was served with fries and a good brown thick gravy and it hit the spot.

A very varied menu with a lot of specials...."}
{"text":"Probably waited for 2 hours for a burger fries and shake 

1 elderly lady working 

2 families and myself 

REALLYYYY"}
{"text":"Love service here, always been great. The food is good, almost consistent quality. Really love the corned beef hash eggs Benedict! Most of the time really good, at last visit a couple of weeks ago there was barely any corned beef hash under the hollandaise. Waiters are very nice, great to see the same familiar faces."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner.  After finding most places closed for the night, I found Wimpy's open--just barely!  Coming in at just before closing, the staff had no resistance to seating us and serving.  They advised us that the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes, so we ordered quickly.  They took the time to clarify the order and entertained special requests.

I ordered the Fish & Chips but with a sub garden salad instead.  I had been craving this for a while, which usually leads to unreasonable expectations.  In this case, expectations were met.  No objection, no complaint.  That earns a star!

The food came quickly, and with quality.  It did not appear like the kitchen  rushed at all.  We ate and left without any pressure.  Attitude speaks volumes, even when people try to hide it.  I would drive out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Definitely right down the centreline when it comes to hitting the mark for breakfasts.  Good variety, well executed, Wimpy's breakfasts are hard for me to pass by.  The classic 3 eggs, bacon, home fries and toast is my favourite.

Not just the food, but the ambiance is a big part of the charm.  With the quaint '50's decor, it's a blast from the past.  I don't know what it is, but I also like the Waffle House in the U.S. for the same reason--it has the appearance of a throwback greasy spoon diner, but I don't remember the food being this good.  How times have changed!"}
{"text":"This location has fallen out of favour.  Stopping in for a nice breakfast, there was not a lot to praise.  Starting with a cup of decaf, I was told they only serve instant decaf.  Strike one.

The 3 egg breakfast came with a mound of fried potatoes, that were throughly over salted.  Strike two.

Like many, I enjoy PB&J on my toast.  The waitress brought the jam, but no peanut butter.  Being allergen free was the excuse, but I don't buy it.  Wimpy's on Yonge in Aurora still serves peanut butter.  Strike three.

Back to the minors for you!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins + for our plates to arrive. I get that they were busy, but the worst part is everything that could be messed up was.. including wrong orders multiple times.."}
{"text":"Typical American breakfast with decent prices. There are better options but when it's in your area why not. It's a hit and miss with which servers you get but the food is what matters and it is pretty good."}
{"text":"This the worst breakfast ever! The strawberries were soaked in booze, or has fermented! Threw up in the dirtiest bathroom I ever saw"}
{"text":"My second time here and anytime you're nostaligically craving some old diner food Wimpy's is usually a safe bet! 
Thankfully there's a location thats close to home Hwy 404 and Steeles at Shops @ Steeles Plaza. The interior is decked in a 60's to reminisce the old days, with bar stools along the counters, checkered floors, and overal vibe.  The last time I came here their Corn Hash special $9.75 was pretty scrumptious, however second time around the Burger GoDS were calling me back.
Last time I had a burger was approximately 4 months at Johnny's, so it was long overdue! Wimpy's TEX-MEX 10oz was my saviour, and boy was it huge. I up-ed/ biggie'd my combo to include fries and a coffee.  All Canadian BEEF you could taste the quality of the meat, and to me that was KEY. There's nothing worse than having bad quality beef, and quite honestly it can MAKE or BREAK a good burger experience.  Thankfully Wimpy's has maintained it quality grade beef which is why it's always a diner favorite.  The service was awesome, and quite efficient.......................................................................To be honest all this place is missing is GUY FIERI from Triple D (Diners Drive-ins and Dives) :P"}
{"text":"Saturday morning breakfast at Wimpy's was definitely a nice experience.  This franchise on Yonge St in Thornhill was convinient for our family to hit up. The place is quite small, but cozy, with american vintage decor posted all over the walls, along with the old style countertop bar/ bar stools. However do try and come here earlier if for Breakfast or you can find yourself waiting, but not too long.

The service we had was very efficient, and up-beat! after all this diner is always packed, so hence its needed lol...

Now the works! after contemplation, I resorted to having their French Toast breakfast! wow! were the portions more than enough.  Two big slices French Toast, three sausages, eggs, and fruits on the side. 
I was able to smooch some potatos off my gramps plate, and yum was it good...In terms of coming back to Wimpy's, no need to think twice about it!
I was extremely satisfied with everything, the food, service, affordability, and ambience!"}
{"text":"This wonderful place is easy to miss as it's somewhat buried in the corner of a retail mall but this outlet serves the same top-grade diner fare as others in the chain. Their oversized burger patties are a favorite as is the exceptional eggs Benedict. Really, you can't go wrong with just about anything on the expansive menu."}
{"text":"This is a neat little diner. Our usual faves are the Eggs Benedict and the cheeseburger with its oddly-shaped, oversized patty. Not necessarily because it's the best burger I've ever had (though it IS pretty darn good) but because it's go different. When you're eating it, it makes you feel like there's so much meat it's literally overflowing. Pretty novel I think.

We've also had the turkey dinner and hot beef sandwich. Both pretty much exactly as you'd expect it from a diner, which is a good thing. Wednesday is all you can eat spaghetti and meatballs, which as also surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Not a good experience today. Staff are in rush and keep forgetting to bring stuff.  Dish and spoons were not clean. Food was good though."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick burger at lunch time. Food is cooked and served quite quick. The staff are friendly, prompt, and polite. The restaurant is pretty busy during lunch, yet it all holds together exceedingly well. A convenient location in DownTown Whitby too, although I can't figure out why for the life of me they aren't open late on Fridays and Saturdays when the downtown of Whitby is packed with party goers eager to spend money... Maybe we will see that change soon."}
{"text":"Wimpy's diner has been a staple on royal windsor for a while and we've always been dying to check it out.

The restaurant itself is huge with tons of seating and funky retro 50s pictures of elvis and monroe etc etc as well as retro tables and chairs.

The menu is quite extensive with a featured all day breakfast.
I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich which was terribly underwhelming, my husband ordered a burger which he said was 'meh'. The fries were tasty though and I would be okay with checking this place out again and trying something else. 

Service is good, but we came during a lunch rush with only one server so it did take some time to receive our food.

Not bad, will try again.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once and would never go back. Had breakfast... The bacon was greasy, the potatoes were almost raw, and worst of all the coffee was COLD
Would not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This location used to be reliable for consistently decent food but based on my consumer experience on Thursday and my friends on Friday -  the quality of food has gone way down. I noticed new waitstaff and cooks so I wonder if it has anything to do with that, hmm? 

Peameal bacon on Eggs Benedict was so chewy it was unpalatable, Turkey bacon looked like pasty white mutant food... stiff and stale as a board. Coca cola from the fountain was flat (how, why?!!)  so I opted for C plus in a bottle since there was no canned/bottled coca cola or Pepsi. Poached eggs were undercooked. 

Friend said the Philly sandwich he ordered on Friday was super greasy and to top it off the bun was burnt! He agrees the food used to be much better.  what a shame...kitchen looks dirty as hell (and I'm sorry,  some of the cooks do too!) I won't be going back for a long time!"}
{"text":"Meal - Flash back combo, French Toast served with Nutella, Coke, Coffee and an epic milkshake.

Setting
Very cute retro setting, love the juke boxes at the table with songs, even though they don't work, they are EPIC.

NEW Flashback Combo
3 eggs, 2 pcs peameal, 2 pcs bacon, 2 sausages, home fries and 2 buttermilk pancakes.
Eggs were made perfectly, they were light fluffy and down right delicious... added a little salt and pepper great, the sausages were very tasty as was the bacon strips, crispy and cooked perfectly. The peameal bacon was drier than I would have liked, cooked a bit too much and perhaps for far too long, it's an unforgiving meat to cook, because after you have gone over the threshold for perfection it's like a piece of rubber, no one can fault you, it's hit or miss some days for anyone. Home fries were undercooked, and a tad crunchy and I like my home fries mushy with some onions, but I could appreciate the pieces that were well cooked and ate them as they were lovely. My biggest disappointment was the pancakes, I could have easily overlooked everything if the pancakes were light, fluffy and soaked up the lovely syrup you provided but sadly, it was a no go.. one side was light and fluffy, the underneath however was hard and chewy. I will try again, as I believe you deserve another chance, pancakes are not my strong suit personally and we have all had our days waring with that breakfast food. This scores a 2/5

NEW French Toast served with Nutella
Drizzled with chocolate hazelnut. Served with whipped cream.
My boyfriend and I have one word for this breakfast treat \"Perfection\". Score - 5/5

Vanilla & Banana Shake
AMAZING!!!! Score 5/5

Coffee
It's pretty good coffee, and they are very generous with their milk and cream. Bonus. Score 5/5

Service - Our server was a lovely lady, she did her best to accommodate us and food was brought out in a timely manner. She added a warmth to the establishment one would not have expected, she is truly a gem and we personally adored her. Score 5/5

We will certainly be back to try things from their Lunch and Dinner Menu."}
{"text":"What an incredibly dishonest restaurant. We had placed an order through skip the dishes and had to cancel it within the first 5 minutes of placing the order. We had a family emergency that we had to deal with. This restaurant refused to cancel the order. No one was at my house to accept the order which they insisted upon sending, knowing that we would not be there to accept it. 
I called them to speak to them about being refunded for the order but they refused to refund the order and the manager Raj pretended that he was not in, as we called a second time and they claimed the manager was not available right now after telling me that the manager was off and at an 'event'... Skipped the dishes called and explained to the owner that we had a family emergency and we weren't able to be at the location to accept the order and they still refused to refund the order stating \"foods made, what's the problem\". Their staff was equally horrid when I called, the waitress could be heard over the phone speaking to each other and stated \"She ordered the food, she should pay\". I have ordered from this location 8-10 times, this was the first time we have ever had to cancel an order and we did so within 5 minutes of placing the order but they claimed that the meal was already cooked... lol ( there's never been a time when I sat in a Wimpy's restaurant that they started preparing my meal before a good 10 to 15 minutes in). I hope that it was worth losing a loyal customer over $38. Skip the dishes however was very understanding and offered us a max refund on their part, because they understood how unreasonable the restaurant was being.
I would call them incredibly unethical and lacking any basic compassion for their customers.
I caution you about their poor customer service and their food. 
Their food is equally disgusting, most of the time the pancakes are undercooked, the eggs are hard and every combo we have ever ordered from them has always been sent without a drink and they tend to claim that the 'driver' has forgotten it, but it's happened about 3 times... so we know who's actually forgetting it. We have also eaten there and I will say that their wait staff is incredibly rude to customers and disorganized, they are unable to take an order correctly, it's why we started ordering in rather than dining in. While they do fail at most breakfast foods, their Burger and club sandwich was actually fairly good, but this location is not worth dealing with anymore."}
{"text":"Came here mid week early with a friend for breakfast 
Service was food food came out fairly quickly .
Had a breakfast special with 3 eggs bacon and sausage was very good and fresh .There coffee is pretty good aswell .if I'm in the area I'd Come back for sure ."}
{"text":"Well I finally tried the new Wimpys in my area ! 
So it was a Friday evening and a few friends and I were hungry,  and seeing that wimpys was open 
24hrs , we thought hey let's try it .....
So going in ...the decor is cool , very cool infact .
Awesome 50s style decor everywhere ! 
I ordered the Fish & chips 
My buddy ordered the classic wimpys burger 
And my other buddy ordered the 
Classic poutine ! 
The burger was dry and over cooked ,which we were very surprised , but whatever right,  let's try the poutine ...should be good right ! 
The gravy was clumpy and had like the gravy skin as if it's been sitting all day , you know what  I'm talking about that skin that forms like Ontop of milk if it's sits too long !!
Old gravy yea it's true !!
The waitress took it back and brought another one but it was the same ...very sad 
And my fish & chips .....oh my fish & chips ....
(Sigh).....I wish oh how I wish I could have enjoyed them I was so craving them they were rock hard like a weapon but hey maybe it was supposed to be that hard what do I know ?? Oh wait I do know I once worked in a restaurant . 
Anyways I really really wish I could have enjoyed mine at least,  considering I live around the corner , and love a good diner in my area !! 
It's sad to say So sad ......

I will say the service was decent the waitress was pleasant 
The decor is nice and pretty cool 
They do serve alcohol which is a bonus 

The food .....(sigh ) I wanna cry I wish it was good"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, joint. attentive staff. Good variety on the menu. Food was on par with what you'd find at a Denny's. But hey, it's 24hr so not a bad option for a 4am burger mish."}
{"text":"My new breakfast go to spot. By breakfast I mean I want to eat everything on the menu at all times of day. It's a small spot and always seems to be filled with happy couples, families, kids and adorable grandparents. Staff is super sweet and helpful and my coffee cup is always full. 

I've tried:
- poutine - full of cheese and gravy. It's savory and filling and delicious. Definitely recommend.
- fish and chips but I never actually get the chips, just the fish. So crispy and soft and just yum. I order it every time I come. 
- the ultimate club sandwich. Meh. It's ok, there's a lot of bacon and the portion is huge but I don't know how I feel about the chicken breast in it (turkey..?). It's a bit dry, whatever it is. Comes with coleslaw like the other sandwiches. Coleslaw is kind of soggy. I'd give this one a 3 out of 5. 
- eggs are done to perfection. The Benedict is a must have but I'm sad they don't have smoked salmon :( 

Overall, huge fan. Will keep coming back and trying to eat my way through the huge and overwhelming menu!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a casual meal. Wouldnt come here for an occasion. Usually come here if i want to feel like im at home. 
I come here a couple times a month and get the same thing- chicken souvlaki with greek salad. Trying out new things on the menu us very hard because its either a hit or miss. 
The service is great.. If the place is empty. When its busy in there the servers usually forget about you or your order. 

The food is alright. Takes time to cook, but quality is usually great.

If you decide on getting the double burger.. Its massive!"}
{"text":"The thing about chain restaurants is that there is supposed to be a basic consistency between locations. And with Wimpy's, there is that. But some locations stand out more than others. 

This is one of those locations.

The food here tastes fresh and homemade. The service is friendly and efficient.

I always order breakfast or fish and salad. The portions are large, and the food shows up on your table quickly.

This is one of the best Wimpy's in the chain."}
{"text":"Ive been to Wimpys many times. I usually order the original hamburger meal. It was excellent until recently they changed their burger. Why change a good thing?? Now the burger is nothing special. Not enough to come back craving it. One thing I like is you get a good bang for your buck. Dinner for two is like less than $25 if you play your cards right. However I dont think the cooks are that friendly to their employees. One time I had to ask a waitress if she was okay she seemed upset and crying after she was yelled at by one of the cooks. That was unprofessional. I felt really bad for her. Not sure when I return now, switch back the burger!"}
{"text":"Wimpy's has a surprisingly varied menu and it's even licensed. But you probably come for the burgers. This isn't a fast food restaurant but sit down. Service is quick, however. Your burger and fries are served up quicker than Harvey's can slide one out. 

I've found faux diner joints like Johnny Rockets to serve really substandard food. While I can't vouch for the rest of Wimpy's menu, the burger was surprisingly good. As you can see from the pictures, it's a kind of \"double wide\" patty nicely topped with onions and condiments. The fries were a bit of a let down. But the burger for sure would have me back."}
{"text":"My son and I are regulars there. We go there every other Sunday for a brunch. The staff is friendly, the food is comfort food, but of a good quality. The atmosphere, oh the atmosphere is of old American movies. I love it. The music, the posters, the nice time together in a diner where we can stuff ourselves with whatever our hearts desire and not be bothered by anyone. The waiters respond in a glimpse of an eye and are accomodating and friendly. I think, I mentioned it already, but it is worth repetition, since, I think it is very important. See you soon, Wimpy's."}
{"text":"Excellent diner with very friendly service, tasty food, and cool decorations. The shepherd's pie was delicious and so was wimpy's poutine. Highly recommended for a good meal and relaxing time."}
{"text":"I am not really a huge fan of Wimpy's, but this would be my favorite location in Toronto. Every Wimpy's seems to do their own thing? Why I am not sure, but if you find something you like at one location it will more then luckily be different at another location.

The service is always friendly, and fast. No matter how busy the place is they still get things done at a reasonable time. 

Weekday lunches and weekend brunches seems to be the busy time for this classic style diner. 

If its fast, greasy food you are looking for, without all the frills then stop into this location."}
{"text":"Nice place to go. I think they are targeting older visited as most the signs and themes correspondence to the 60 s. I liked that tho and it was nice to check it. The server was very unique she was good with special attitude. We came for the breakfast special which was before 10. It was cheap but not as good quality. As I had better breakfasts. But the you cannot go wrong for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Love the classic diner deco. Staff is nice"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that I absolutely love this place. This may come off as biased but they have given me no reason not to. I've been here on several occasions with my boyfriend for a late night burger, and their burgers never disappoint! I usually get their \"small\" classic cheeseburger (6 oz, ergo \"small\"), while my boyfriend orders their famous 10 oz burger. It's absolutely incredible how huge their parties are. Full toppings include all the veggies you could possibly need, with mustard, ketchup, mayo, bbq sauce, and relish offered as condiments. You could add a fried egg to your burger for an extra dollar or so (highly recommend!), along with cheese, bacon, onion, and mushroom (just what I could think of off the top of my head). Honestly a great experience, the staff is always friendly and the service is exceptionally quick. Be sure to order their Oreo milkshake as it's exactly what a milkshake should be: thick, creamy, and delicious! The interior decoration is fun and the facilities are clean, albeit a bit outdated. 

TLDR; 10/10 highly recommend get their famous 10 oz burger if you're hungry (+ egg, cheese, bacon) and their Oreo milkshake for a classical diner experience!"}
{"text":"We were a little scared when there was only one older gentleman there on a Friday night, but for some reason we persevered. Partly due to still not being super familiar with the area yet and trying to find more restaurants we like, which has been a challenge. I read the reviews and saw that not getting enough cheese in the omelettes was a concern, so I asked for extra cheese, and it worked out well. The potatoes that came with the omelette weren't very tasty in my opinion. I also got a root beer float, and it was pretty weird. The menu said there would be two scoops of ice cream, but there was only one, and they put ice in with the root beer. I've never seen that in a root beer float before. It was a decent meal, but simple and could likely easily be replicated at home."}
{"text":"Wimpy's Diner has a cool looking atmosphere along with some economy breakfast menu choices till 11am.  Or splurge on what you desire from their menu, even for vegetarians.  I tried their breakfast special with two eggs, potatoes, choice of meat, choice of bread for four bucks.  The turkey bacon was low in fat and low in satisfaction.  Credit cards accepted, street parking, open Monday-Thursday 8am-8pm, Friday-Saturday 8am-8:30pm, Sunday 8am-4pm."}
{"text":"Are experience here was less than impressive. The chatter by the staff should have been had after their shift. The server was constantly changing, some were very nice, some were iffy.

Food was ok, nothing spectacular. Portions were large, so much so that both my friend and I took part of our meal home. 

Varied menu in a nice, diner environment but they are very much focused on the regular customers at the price of the occasional visitor.

Overall, I've seen nicer Wimpy's diners."}
{"text":"Okay food, staff is friendly enough. Prices are average at best and the reason I'm giving 2 star is because when I ordered by scrambled eggs with sausage, the waitress dropped a sausage while putting my food down... And never replaced one. Charged for the same price and she never even apologized. Not going back!"}
{"text":"I was ravenous, needed pancakes and we were kind of in the middle of nowhere (don't hate, I grew up near here, I know what I'm talking about). Looked up Golden Griddle. Sadly the one we were looking for was no longer there. Back up plan? Wimpy's. I'd only ever been to one years ago and it hadn't made a stand out impression on me, but I was starving, so we went. The staff are friendly, I love the amount of variety on the menu! I had the breakfast with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon and toast. They have a good system and lots of hearty foods (with some lighter selections), tons of options and the prices were okay, as well. I'd go back (especially because I despise paying $10 downtown for 3 pancakes)!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool.  It is a made believe 60's diner.  The decor is all about the 50's to 60's.  All it is missing a a jukebox.  The menu is like a scaled down Danny's: all day breakfast, burgers with super-sized beef patty, sandwiches, fish and chips, salads, etc..  Where it is different from Danny's is that Danny's has ventured into contemporary dinner items and Wimpy's remains true to its heritage.  

We ordered a classic breakfast and a classic burger, and they were so good.  The breakfast was good as expected.  The burger was as good as Harvey's.  What truly blew my mind was the pricing.  They are LOW.  For example, coffee with refill is $1.90.

The services was efficient, effective and friendly."}
{"text":"I go to Wimpy's, any location, for their all day breakfast and original burger.  That and the services.  I have never been to a Wimpy's where the services are not effective, efficient and super friendly.  This location far north on Elgin Mills is no different.  The portion of the original burger ($8) was crazy large, as well as the onion rings combo ($4).  The burger was good, not gourmet, just the way it had always been.  The fried onion rings were *excellent*.  I ordered a junior (kid) burger ($6) for mom.  The junior came with patty and bun that were just a hint smaller than the original burger.  I probably should have ordered it instead.

Coffee was good enough and bottomless.  Waitress refilled our cups on request.

I recommend Wimpy's as a reasonably priced, neighborhood diner, especially for breakfast and burger, and good services."}
{"text":"Don't know if it is true, but someone has told me this is the first Wimpy's in Toronto.  The decor is an adorable 60's and 70's feel, including the booths.  I ordered a Striploin Steak dinner because I felt like having a cheap steak.  In other words, quality was not my number one concern.  The steak meat was okay, diner style.  As expected, medium rare became medium well.  The home fries were good not great.  

This local gem has average steak for a diner (below average for a steakshouse of course) but exceptional services.  I was served by 2 waitresses.  Both were diner-style friendly and talked to me like I were a regular (I am not).  They took my order while I waited for a table, so I could sip on an ice tea while I waited.  I was never rushed out even though there was a line waiting for tables.

I am going to give 3 stars for cheap steak plus an extra 0.5 star for services.  Since I am sure this will be a 4-starred joint for all day breakfast, I boldly go 4 stars anyway."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's small however so timing is important in order to get a table. Food is great assuming you keep your expectations at what it is! It's a diner, portions are great but don't expect a 5 star restaurants service."}
{"text":"Again, my Scarborough bias might be showing here with a lack of good spots in the area (and I happen to live right up the street) but I LOVE this greasy spoon. Everything on the menu is a solid choice. Everybody knows about the burgers and breakfast but they also do great liver, souvlaki, sandwiches, etc. They released a new menu too with all kinds of interesting stuff. 

All the staff members are always fantastic. Great \"family\" feel.

Yes it is a small joint so you might not get a table at peak hours but I've never had a problem. I think the mafioso feel of the strip mall keeps the crowds at bay. On par with T-Bone's for \"colorful\" clientele.

Wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Was in the area and had a hankering for a burger. Thankfully a wimpy was nearby, and they never seem to fail me. 

The service here was quick, friendly and efficient. Food arrived quickly, piping hot and fresh. They had a few other little things that was new on the menu that we tried and they were just as tasty as we expected."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a wimpy diner, I highly recommend going to try one. If you have been to a wimpy before, this one still has just as good of food and service as nearly any other.

The burger I noticed still is quit large, but somehow seems drier these days when I go. The onion rings remain large, crispy and tasty and the other half loves the all day breakfast variety.

Wimpys has an excellent selection of American food, with burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, dinner and everything in between.

My first experience with wimpys was actually at this location, and this location  actually doubled in size in the past few years as they took over the space next door which is a welcome addition. They still bring in crowds of all ages for breakfast to dinner and seem very consistent through out their franchises and this location.

It's my comfort food go to when I'm in the area and looks to remain so for the foreseeable future"}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly staff and cool atmosphere. A little if the small size and the is usually a line up on the weekend (especially for breakfast/lunch). Not really suited for parties of larger than 4; as the table size is limited."}
{"text":"I've been watching \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" aka Triple D on the food network lately and watching this show makes me hungry all the time. The show visits many diners in the US and it makes me wonder why there are so few diners in Toronto. Or am I looking in the wrong areas? So a quick search on Yelp with the word \"diner\" showed Wimpy's Diner as the first result. So this is what prompted my visit to Wimpy's. The decor is snazzy but if you compare to the diners on the show Triple D it doesn't even come close. 

Ordered up a Philly cheese with beef + Onion rings and a French Toast combo with sausage and bacon. About $10 for each dish. The food was good but nothing really stood out and wowed me. The best part of the meal was the beef sandwich. It was tasted really fresh but flavorwise it seem plain. The French toast was nothing special. Just a regular slice of Wonder bread with eggs.....could have made that myself at home. Well, I guess I will continue my search for the ultimate diner in Toronto. Next stop... Hazel's Diner"}
{"text":"It's bad. It's always been bad. I have no idea how this place is still open. I only ate here a few times & had to stop because I would get an upset tummy."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this chain. I'm so glad I did. Markham is in need of more western style breakfast and brunch places. Especially diners! This location is hidden in the plaza at Don Mills and Steeles. I  love this place. It has a retro vibe with posters of stars from the 50's and 60's. The menu is classic diner fare, greasy spoon type. Early bird special, all day breakfast, really decent prices around $5-8 per order. Service was quick and friendly! And the food was greasy and satisfying. Coffee wasn't memorable but it was acceptable."}
{"text":"We miss the previous owners. Came in for New year's day breakfast and left before we got our food. They took 10 minutes to get a server to take our order. My husband ordered bacon and eggs with coffee and I ordered corn beef hash Benedict with Tea. The best part of the meal was the coffee and Tea.  We sat and waited 45 minutes for our food. Even if the food isn't ready, the  server can visit our table with warm beverages. This didn't happen. We saw the manager walking by and so we inquired about our food. She explained our order got lost and to give her 5 minutes. We left upset because we wasted 1 hour of our time that we can't get back. Seriously you serve breakfast this shouldn't have happened.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great, friendly customer service. Tasty diner food, big portions!  We've been twice in three days and have been very happy both times. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Breakfast pancakes were dry, hard and uneatable.  We told our server but they weren't replaced, just a sorry.  We have always been very happy with our breakfast at Wimpy's at Willowdale and Sheppard and never had a problem.  Staff was their usual friendly self and good service.  We hadn't seen this server before or the cook either.  We will probably go again but not order pancakes."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, had a club sandwich,
seven out of 10 stars.  Service was good, waited too long for the check."}
{"text":"This place is very cool!  Great 50's diner vibe with booths, jukeboxes, funky old signs and art.  Service was mostly friendly and efficient and the food was pretty darn good.  One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!  Big portions.  Huge step up from your regular fast food joints, $13.00 veggie combo, while it appears pricey, is actually pretty fair for the quality/quantity you get.  Call me a fan!"}
{"text":"Seeing as how the Denny's on Cross recently went bankrupt, Wimpy's has become among the best choices in Oakville for all-day breakfast / brunch. Wimpy's has changed for the better under the new management, and I must say that I am extremely impressed with their business acumen. They recently revamped their menu to be smaller, better organized, and easier-to-read. They have also introduced new items, with one of the most welcome additions being a delicious and juicy 1LB burger (which is so big, it could easily feed two). Customer service has dramatically improved over the last 3 years, with the servers being attentive and friendly to every table. If Wimpy's continues in this positive direction, they will be my first choice for sit-down breakfast. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is actually my first review in YELP, since I got so many useful information from it, it is my time to contribute, plz bare with my long words, just try to price as much as useful information as possible)
We went to this location particular due to so many positive reviews in YELP.
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!WORST EXPERIENCE IN RECENT 5 YEARS. 
First, positive things. Food is not bad, but not good neither, more like A&W burger level. 
After we get there, a white-skin more than average body shape waitress recommend the wholy cow burger, which is NOT in the menu, what she didn't tell us is the price for 10oz wholy cow burger is TWICE PRICE AS OTHER 20oz burgers.( yes, one 10 oz wholy cow burger is equal 40oz normal burger they offered, and she didn't  tell us the price, just kept selling it to us, and we are not cautious enough to ask the price, our bad). ASK FOR THE PRICE BEFORE BUYING THE WHOLY COW BURGER!
She don't let us to order the burger itself even though  in the bill it said \"add mashed potato +4.99, we kept told her that we don't want it and it might be wasted,wasting food is not good, she  just insisted to ask us to order, we have no choice to order it( we don't wAnt to leave cuz we drive all the way just in order to taste their good reviewed foods:(
Then the service, no smiles whatsoever, she and another waitress just thrown the plates on the table, no single polite 'you r welcome' after more than ten \"thank you\" from us. The second we finished our meal, the waitress brought us the bill even though we told her that we want to pay it after our friend came back from washroom, she just ignore our words and brought the machine and stand beside us and staring at us, which make all of us very very uncomfortable.
All in all, food is not bad, but if you are looking for a pleasant eating experience, I REALLY REALLY DOUBT THAT. All of us just think they are so eager to earn cash rather than giving you a good eating experience."}
{"text":"I've only eaten breakfast here. Good place, and the only breakfast place in the area. 
Nice and comfortable booth seating - they have the 1960's look with all the nostalgic photos and props. 

food is always good. portions are quite decent, almost large too. Standard canadian breakfast fare - ham, sausage, eggs, toast. Also on lunch menu are many more sandwiches and burgers.

Waitresses always seem to be extra nice. Filling up coffee. Asking if you need anything else. must have a good training program!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for breakfast with a local friend. The egg dishes are uniformly excellent -- some come with pancakes! -- and the service is friendly and efficient. (It doesn't hurt that my friend's a \"regular,\" I imagine.)"}
{"text":"We have been there twice on a Sunday for breakfast and there were very few people in the restaurant and services extremely slow. You would figure the waitresses would look around at the tables to see if anybody needs anything but they don't. It's an average breakfast nothing special prices are a little high I guess you pay for what you get"}
{"text":"First and foremost the service here is amazing, its like visiting that one awesome aunties place for lunch.  Great food, good laughs and amazing people.  I got the chicken club with fries and it was great.  Portion size was good and was made fresh to order with real chicken breast.  The atmosphere is that of your typical local diners and the staff is super friendly, you gotta check it out, great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Wimpys is one of my favourite breakfast restaurants.  It has the usual breakfast fare, serving all day, as well as sandwiches, a few diner-style restaurant meal options, and floats and milkshakes.  What I love the most is their home fries - I'm not sure what it is about them, but they are good.  I also enjoy their omelettes and their souvlaki on a bun.  Another favourite is the poutine, not real poutine with cheese curds, they use shredded cheddar cheese, but the fries are almost swimming in gravy with gobs of cheese on top.  The poutine is the sort of thing you don't want to order if you don't like others at your table snatching your food off your plate.  The servers are generally friendly, maybe with the occasional mistake but it is always easily fixable.  I would highly recommend this as a breakfast or lunch destination at any time of day!
UPDATE: Their prices went up by a couple of dollars on each item last year.  I might have been able to live with that but they changed their food.  Their \"home fries\" are now hash browns with disgusting amounts of garlic in them.  To get what used to be home fries, ask for \"potato rounds\".  The big problem is that they cheaped out on ingredients.  I used to love their American Omelette but now they barely put a sprinkle of cheese in it.  They took a great restaurant and ruined it, so my five stars are now two.  Sure their food is technically edible, but I will not be making the effort to drive over there anymore for disappointing food at a high price.  Thanks for ruining a good thing, Wimpys."}
{"text":"Great Greasy Spoon!  SO MUCH FOOD!  Some days I think about ordering my meal with out the home fries, but then think again.

The staff are amazing!  Ask for Stacey, she's so much fun and is always fast!  She's just about to have a baby and this girl can still move!

It's a great hang over place and the prices are reasonable.  On the other hand the bathrooms leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Always guaranteed a good breakfast. Fast service and wholesome food. Portions are generous, although I wish the plates were two eggs, three is always too much for me. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. Don't know if it was because it was -40 degrees outside but the restaurant was really cold, I had to keep my coat on.  Will go back as good bang got your buck."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was that the service was amazing. It was prompt, personal, and attentive. 

After ordering I realized how many people in there were regulars. Customers struck up conversations with the staff like they've been doing it for years. 

Then the food came. I love how unique the burger was. Tasted good. Not amazing bit definitely good enough for a diner. 

The ambience was just that as well. Old school diner. They even had some old 1992 blue jays posters up. 

Onion rings were the bomb and drinks are refills. 

Good experience overall"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Wimpy's location. I love burgers and fries, and this place has the best. I always order the famous hamburger combo with bacon and cheese added and gravy on the side for my fries. The burger never fails to impress and is HUGE. The fries are fantastic, crispy and thick and the gravy is amazing. This is actually one of my favourite places to eat, period."}
{"text":"Wasn't welcomed properly or seated in this wimpys in different locations I was welcomed with a smile and seated.
My fork had a very sticky mush on the back that was not cleaned off right unfortunately I did not notice it till I was done eating when I flipped around my fork and I know it was not from my food because it was not any type of food it turned me right off my table was sticky and my waiter was not very welcoming and seemed like she did not care and she would continue talking to her friends and yeilling out sit anywhere when someone walked in when I was finished eating I was waiting for her for about 15 min before she actually stopped talking to friends and came over and asked if I was finished and if I would like anything else the food was slapped together I understand its a 24 hour wimpys and you have to serve and make a lot of food in a fast paste time but it could of been neater and cooked a bit more. Restaurant looked dirty could be a pit more cleaner and cleaned ask people left their both."}
{"text":"Out of the three Wimpys I have been to this has to be the best amazing food and amazing service 
Staff checked in with me about every 10-15 min to see how everything was going and they were also very friendly and welcoming walking in and seeing a big smile and a hello I knew this was a good safe place to have a nice meal."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews really surprised me. 

My review is based on new staff. I'm not sure if the locations has a new management team though. 

Anyways. I'm notoriously know for being there after midnight since I finish work late. I never dine in, rather take out. But my food is always hot, fresh and no complications. 
The stuff is absolutely amazing. Sweet ladies and cooks. I've yet to have problems. 

I've also come here during the day. It's has it usual crowd as well as new folks. No matter how busy it is, the staff will do anything in their power for food to come out in time. 

The place is a diner so don't expect a posh atmosphere. It's suppose to look old and rustic. However, it's quite clean inside and the noise level REALLY depends on how's dining. Not the servers. So don't complain when you go on a busy day that it's really noisy. That's not the servers fault. Stop being stupid."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! Drove all the way there on a Saturday evening at around 6pm with my son in tow, got there and the open sign was off.. Relieved when I saw their posted hours were until 10pm until a girl opened the door and said We are Closed. It wasn't busy so we decided to close!!! Who does that? Am I expected to call before going to find out if they are open?what is the point of posted hours. Won't be visiting them again and I definitely wouldn't recommend going as you don't know if it will be open or not!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite local places. Great sandwiches and daily specials.  I have eaten here dozens of times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have never been disappointed with the food.

With the servers however, it's a bit of a crap shoot depending on who you get. They range from seasoned and cranky to new and clueless. But still, they have some real gems there too. 

Since their renovation took place it went from tiny to comfortable, but still not great for large groups.  

But for real...try the specials."}
{"text":"Wimpy's diner is the best place to go and have great food and a lot of fun with the staff. The girls are amazing especially Annette and Chris Jenna and Karen's daughters the whole entire family it's just amazing the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The food is always hot and delicious no matter what you get to eat it is always tasty and delectable I know because I have practically eating everything off of the menu. I recommend this restaurant to families to anyone or groups and friends gathering together for a great time The cooks Nick and Chris are fantastic. I have to admit that for the past 18 years it has been my favorite place to go to and I highly recommend this restaurant to the people of Newmarket and surrounding area you always have smiles and laughter when you go into wimpys diner. I love you guys at wimpys you're fabulous. Hooray !!!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaoooowwww. Please run away from this Wimpys. Run far far awayyyyyy. It is awful. Truly truly awful on all fronts that count in food service.

We walk in on a weekend afternoon and the place is mildly busy. We stand at the front waiting to be seated and no one approaches us. Not a single server acknowledges us, not even to tell us to take a seat anywhere we want. I'd understand if it was busy or something, but there were many empty tables and the servers were running around as if they were slammed. And there were about 4 servers for a total of about 10 tables TOPS. So I don't understand the shitty ass service we got (or didn't get as we walked in the door).  We stand there in some confusion, trying to figure out how their seating works for around 5 minutes before finally taking a seat at a table in front of us.

The table was dirty. So they wait until people sit down to wipe down the table in front of you and put down cutlery. Gross.

Took around 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and hurriedly take our order. My boyfriend ordered a bottle of Canadian and was served a pint...by a different server. Service seems disorganized and ridiculous, we heard one server yell at others for some bullshit. Everyone just seems panicked for NO REASON AT ALL. It's brunch on a Sunday you guys, and it's not even full capacity. EVERYONE RELAX and focus on decent service. 

Our food was generally awful, My bacon wasn't even real bacon - it was some weird fake bacon closer to the travesty that is \"turkey\" or \"chicken\" bacon. Eggs were rubbery, potatoes were not memorable. The best part of my meal was their rye bread. Which...should say something; that the toast that they likely purchased elsewhere was the best part of my meal is depressing.

This place is messy. Messy service, messy food and messy servers. You are better off literally anywhere else. Like honestly, go to the Dollarama next door and get a chocolate bar."}
{"text":"Nothing ever disappoints at this Wimpy's location. The burgers are tasty, greasy and filling. The poutines have the perfect cheese to gravy ratio, with fluffy soggy fries. Breakfast is always on point, great sausage, and the grilled cheese with bacon is where it's at. One of my favourite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment on a whim. We were driving home around 8ish in the evening and decided that we were going to come here. We walked into the restaurant and it was EMPTY. I think maybe there was one booth with two people in it. We eventually got noticed and was told to sit anywhere we would like. 

So we got the menus and the selection was HUGE. I order a fish and chips with onion rings instead. My boyfriend got the junior burger with a side of fries. The food came at a reasonable time. The fish and onion rings were overcooked and greasy. The coleslaw was flavourless and warm. His food, the patty (which is original to Wimpys) was bigger than the bun. He enjoyed it, I figured theres probably nothing special so I wouldn't give it a bite. 

Overall, it wouldn't be my first choice to eat there. Nothing really jumped up at me that would want me to return from the menu."}
{"text":"After a night of house hunting, I took my boyfriend to Wimpy's in Whitby to get a quick bite to eat. This Wimpys is located just north of Dundas at Brock road on the east side.

One thing I always love about Wimpy's is the classic diner atmosphere. On top of that, the menu here is pretty large so you can find some good diner food to suit just about anyone. They had a few specials on but I ended up going with the Wimpy's turkey club and my boyfriend got chicken fingers. The restaurant was pretty quiet so we got our food quickly and our server was very friendly and accommodating when we needed more time with the menus.

I LOOOOVE the club at Wimpy's - its a great size, big enough for dinner and the only time I've been able to have a side of fries or something is if I split it with someone else. This is probably one of my ultimate club sandwiches - YUM!

Overall, Wimpy's is a great diner with predictably great food. I'll be back to try out some more things and see what else they have to offer - but its going to be hard to tear me away from that club sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wimpy's Diner is my favorite brunch spot in North York. I go there on the weekend for their delicious southwest egg benedict, and the food is always delicious. Plus it's open 24/7 which means that you can show up for breakfast at like 5 AM.

The staff is super friendly and my favorite people there are Melissa and Jennifer who's the manager. I highly recommend that you check this place out for breakfast when you are in the North York area."}
{"text":"I was at Wimpy's Diner a few weeks ago. The portions are big, friendly staff and a cool retro themed environment. It was also very clean. They expanded the restaurant since my last visit and had lots of tables and booths available. I would definitely recommend and will return soon!"}
{"text":"For some reason this place is not really one of my favourite places to go.  However everytime I go I have to admit the food is fresh and tasty.  I had a great omelette with a side of greek salad instead of home fries.  It's reasonably priced, I was only charged a $1 for a generous side salad."}
{"text":"Typical diner- good food and very good service. Exactly what you'd expect for a reasonable price. Don't overthink it- it's breakfast!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with that I feel like this is like reviewing a Burger King or McDonald's but given that its reputation on Yelp is terrible, which doesn't compare to my experiences there at all, I had to let people know what I thought! 

New Years Day some friends and I were ravishingly hungry and hungover and needed to eat. Cora's was closed so we went here.

When we arrived there was a huge lineup. To our surprise it moved rather quickly and we were seated within 10 minutes or so. We got a booth which was cozy bus-style seats. There was a jukebox at the table. We were thinking of using it but didn't but it was cute that it was there.

Our waitress was very friendly and on top of things, even with a diner full of people. I ordered the Wimpy's Club which had bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and chicken breast on white bread. It was good and tasted like a club! The chicken was good quality especially for a restaurant of 1.5 star calibre as it says on Yelp. For a club it was more than I expected from a diner because the chicken was actual chicken breast and not deli meat.

For a diner with an average rating of 1.5 on Yelp I was expecting it to be terrible but I was actually quite impressed. Way better than Denny's or Golden Griddle, and the friendly waitress made our stay there enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very nice interior at this location. Very clean and well organized. Staff is really nice and food is so tasty. The burgers are big too, wish they served more fries though. The milkshakes are even better, but is priced high at $4. The food I found to be expensive too. Not somewhere I'd be going all the time but once in a while for sure. They offer wifi at this location too which is always a bonus !"}
{"text":"I really dont need to get into detail here. Definitely one of my favourite breakfasts at a restaururant. I ordered the pancake combo and everything tasted perfect!

The coffee was incredible too. I must have had 4 cups because I couldn't believe it! I definitely want to return for breakfast soon."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. 

I typically visit the Shops at 404 because it's on my way home. I like the Food Basics and Shoppers Drug Mart. 

I decided to visit the food court. It's not officially a good court, but most eateries are around here. My closest Wimpy's Diner to home is here. 

I decided to give it a try. I went with French toast with scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage links. Everything was yummy. My meal hit the spot. 

I had to ask for ketchup. I also parked myself in front of the TV and watched CBC programming. I got my news update for the day and ended my meal with the Rick Mercer Show. Pretty cultured and Canadian, huh?

The downside was seeing a staff member throw bags of garbage in front of the store, which was right in front of me. Not the most pleasant experience!

I paid by credit card, so I had to go up to the counter at the other end of the restaurant to pay. 

My server was friendly and competent. I'd come back again, hopefully earlier in the day than 7 pm!

{"text":"I come to Aurora fairly often. I like the cineplex here. Next door is Wimpy's.

After seeing a movie probably a good two years ago, I was hungry and decided to drop by this restaurant. 

As a kid, my dad would drive along Warden Avenue, just south of St. Clair. There's was a Wimpy's, but never visited. That restaurant no longer exists.
 
Well, I walked into this Wimpy's and you feel like you're in a time warp. It is like it's either the 1950's or 1960's (well before my time, so I'm not completely sure) with red and blue upholstery. Sirius XM 80's music plays in the background. I don't mind, as I listen to that channel all the time. 

You are free to sit wherever you please. Staff here are always friendly and the service is wonderful. 

I tend to order the hot turkey or beef open-faced sandwich when I want comfort food. Otherwise, I will go with an all-day breakfast combo with pancakes. They are all yummy. 

I don't have any complaints. I am a return customer who likes to eat here and have access to free WiFi."}
{"text":"I crave pancakes every now and then. I also tend to crave then late in the day, meaning that I need to find an all-day breakfast place. 

Wimpy's fixes all my first-world pancake needs! I ordered three blueberry pancakes with a side order of ham. For the record, I tend to do pork sausages, but changed it up a bit. Everything was yummy. My pancakes were done perfectly. I also got to hoard the bottle of maple syrup for a bit. 

I like Wimpy's. The music suits my style, as I can listen to 80's music until everyone around me gets sick! The servers here are always nice. It's comfy. 

Free wifi is wonderful, too. Otherwise, I wouldn't be posting this review so quickly!

There's plenty of parking, as the diner is at the north war corner of Elgin Mills and Bayview. 

If you'd like a quiet place to eat, this diner is for you. There is actually a guy doing work in a booth while he chows down. I don't recommend doing work when you are hungry, but it's an ideal work setting than a loud coffee shop, for instance."}
{"text":"Wimpy's has been my go-to greasy spoon and all-day breakfast spot in Thornhill as far back as I can remember. Their food has consistently been great and the portion sizes are ample for the price. They have the best home-fries I've yet to eat (rather than standard square cubes, they do a pre-boiled sliced variety which is always homemade). Everything is fresh, made-to-order, and served with a smile. Despite the expected increase in price over the years, I still continue to return with family and friends when in the mood for diner-style food. Back when I first started going, the owners/cooks were two older Macedonians (who I and everyone else) thought were husband and wife. They have long since retired and the current owner is a younger gentleman who is frequently present during the day to greet customers and oversee the operation. He is credited with bringing real on-site smoked meats to the location. A new, somewhat renovated dining area with better air conditioning, flat panel TVs, and additional memorabilia offers a comfortable and homey place to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I didn't know Wimpy's did breakfast, so decided to go there with friends a few days ago. 

I really love the classic 50s vibe to the diner. Very old school and classic. They have a full all day breakfast menus with specials if you come before 9 (or 10 - I don't remember). The also have classic diner food like burgers and fries. 

I decided on a spinach and feta omelette. Visually it looked pretty good and came with home fries and toast (of your choice out of white, wheat, or rye). 

The flavours were pretty good, but the home fries, and quite possibly the omelette too, were heavily fried in canola oil. It's a diner, so I am not sure what to expect. The prices are pretty cheap which is good. 

In all, Wimpy's offers classic diner fare and gives an old school vibe. I'll probably return for a milkshake and fries at some point."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place cause I have heard good things and love the fact that it is based on the character from Popeye, a cartoon I used to love as a kid.

We ventured out in the snow to this place last winter and i'm not sure it was worth the drive. 

I had the regular Wimpy's burger, which was absolutely huge.  I did try the poutine with it and it was not too bad for both.  I watched as they brought out other food for people and all of their portions were insanely big, and they were valuable priced considering the portion.  Not sure that I'd be back.  I went for the novelty, but the food wasn't that memorable.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"My review is based on my past experience with other restaurants. I've been to quite a few high end (Ralph Laurent, Canoe) and low end (Pho). 

The intro is meant to give you a perspective of where I'm coming from, unlike magazine reviewers. 

Wimpy's is substandard. I believe that the restaurant's environment plays a major role the total dining experience and appetite - Wimpy's killed my appetite. It's depressingly dark and if you see the sun outside and it's dim inside... there's something wrong. 

The menu was on a sticky plastic. The breakfast is also substandard but maybe this is just me - how can you get wrong with sausages and eggs. So yup, it's just me. 

However, the staff? AMAZING! Our server wasgreat and very attentive to the point of apologetic that she hadn't attended to us. It was nuts - the service was better than 360. Though mind you... the place was a lot smaller. 

I enjoyed the food but I probably won't come back. I know it's not the Carribean but a dim restaurant in Richmond Hill is a bit depressing. 

Three for food, four for service and one for atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were actually heading to our favourite Sunlight Grill but saw that they had converted this place to a Wimpy's and decided to give it a try. 

The place looks similar but different to the old Macy's that was there. Having never been to a Wimpy's before, I am guessing they all sort of follow that same red and yellow vibe. It was cheery enough. 

Having changed plans at the last minute, I had no idea what to expect from their menu. I was really hoping for a few healthier options, which I understand is a laughable concept at most diners. But come on! Even Denny's has whole wheat pancakes and egg whites on their menu. They did not have anything except for the offering of turkey bacon.

I opted to go with the AYCE omelette bar which runs every Saturday and Sunday. For $10.99, it seemed like a great deal as you could also get hashbrowns and mini croissants with your omelette. Ultimately, I liked being able to make my own semi-healthy choices. Kind of, but not really. If you are a big eater, then I would absolutely suggest the omelette bar. 

Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Can't fault them there. We may be back in future to try one of those wacky burgers. But I'm not in any rush."}
{"text":"Found this place in December 2011 while visiting Toronto and wanted a better option than overpriced breakfast at the hotel.  Cute little diner with retro décor and friendly staff.  We all opted for breakfast and were pleased.  Being from the US South, we were a bit confused as to what 'peameal bacon' was, but our waitress was happy to explain.  I loved their home fries - nice and dark on the outside.  My omelette was good, but nothing mind-blowing. 

Overall - just what we were looking for.  Nice local place to grab some greasy-spoon style breakfast and get on with our day.  This is certainly not the place to linger over a long brunch - there were customers waiting for seats the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my order. Will not return. My sandwich was just slop. Falling apart in my hand."}
{"text":"Been here many times find the burgers not that big gotten smaller liked the original owners they were real burgers &bigger than your buns. Will go there once in a while not often ."}
{"text":"No more corned beef hash?!?!?! Whatttttt??? Not impressed as i came here hoping to order corned beef hash, and being an all day breakfast diner, how could you not have corned beef hash?

I ended up ordering the eggs Florentine, the hollandaise sauce was flavorless. Instead of home fries i asked to sub with sweet potatoe fries which was served dark brown black color, not the typical orange color? I suppose it was burnt or triple fried."}
{"text":"I bring my family here all the time. It is the best whimpy's in the GTA bar none. Great food portions, clean restaurant and friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"Good greasy spoon with a large selection of breakfast foods, burgers, hot dogs, and roast beef with gravy.  

I used to come here a lot when I lived in the area.  After a 5 year hiatus I returned to my old neighborhood and decided to come here for some nostalgia.  The food was exactly as I remembered it - the burger was large and in charge!

I honestly would have given this restaurant 4 stars for the food alone, but the service is what brings us to 3 stars.  Our waitress was not very friendly or attentive - she did not come back to the table for a quality check, and we had to flag down another server for refills."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I was there eating a meal of a burger and french fries and it wasn't until I was half done when I realized there were tiny flies all over my fries and burger. I was throwing up in their washroom for a good 10 minutes.  I was so upset and furious."}
{"text":"Not open 24/7! Drove by at 12:57am on a Saturday night and they're closed. Not cool. Update your hours"}
{"text":"I went here on two different occasions. I noticed that this place gets crowded most of the time and there was a chance that your had to wait in line if you wanted to go there. I like their retro style decor, really colourful! Every booth had retro music machines where you'd insert a quarter and choose the songs you wanted to listen to but those don't work anymore. After sitting down, it took more time for the waitress to get your order and to get the food since there were a lot of customers. The food itself was okay, I wasn't a big fan of it but it was nice to have an American styled breakfast during the afternoon. Service was average, nothing special. I noticed that some of the condiments on each table were dirty and it made me feel weird eating there."}
{"text":"When I first walked into this place, I was captivated by the jukebox and its decor. I felt at home and at ease as if I had my past life in the 50's or 60's. 

I ordered the Vege Omelette and substituted the fries for a coleslaw. This omelette here is quite hefty although it's filled with veges. Just a heads up.. I believe it was made with 4 eggs! The omelette could be a bit more salty as I found it to be quite bland. Also, I didn't taste much of the veges in it, perhaps it wasn't fresh?? I mean, I've made omelettes at home before and I can taste the aroma of the onions and green peppers.. not sure, what happened here... Aside from the omelette, the coleslaw was alright. The omelette also came with your choice of brown or rye bread. I chose rye bread and toasted with butter. Wish they would give more than 1 packet of strawberry jam though. How will 1 packet of strawberry jam suffice for 2 pieces of toast?! (Well.. not for me at least..)

Anyway, an order of omelette will keep you full for awhile. Plenty of food, decent price and prompt service. They're always eager to clean off your table once they notice you've stopped eating.."}
{"text":"Long over due review. We haven't been in almost 2 years. Is this fair, you may wonder, but take it as a warning :)
The first time BF and I came, service super friendly and food was awesome diner food. I totally LMAO when I saw someone receiving the 'regular' sizes burger. Omg I'd never seen anything so hugely ridiculous (except on American food shows..lol). I had fish and chips and portion was giant, BF had a burger I think. Everything was so good we couldn't wait for an excuse to come back.  Got take out about a month later, it was good, but suffered from being, well.. take out. That's not on them.  Went maybe 6-8 wks later, noticed a young guy at the 'helm' (aka kitchen) chattin' it up with a buddy. Ordered liver and onions and I fish and chips. Liver was tough and not cooked properly (no little sear on the outside) and it just so happened all the pieces were full of tendons - ok, I know liver is gross for most people, but we love it and this was pretty damn bad. Mashed potato were barely warm, same with the gravy. My fish was soo disappointing. ThicK! batter, not exaggerating saying it was 3/4 inch top and bottom. Batter was of course raw inside. The waitress was nice when I sent it back, they re-coked it, but you could easily tell this kid behind the grill totally could give a damn. We have been 'afraid' to go back even though we live very close by. I've been tempted, but I'll keep up on my fellow Yelpers to steer me the right way.  Inconsistent! is my best way to describe.  Good luck"}
{"text":"The staff is incredible! The chef was very friendly and the waitress was very accommodating. She let the customers right away that they ran out of pies and she brought the menu without any problem when one of us were tempting to get something else after we ordered the food. 
I remember the price of the dessert on the receipt didn't match with price that was from the menu and she changed it without a problem. 
(NOTE: CHECK THE RECEIPT BEFORE YOU PAY IN CASE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS)
 I'm impressed by the variety of food they offer, including the traditional diner menus. The food here is really filling for a reasonable price! I'm really down to come back for more stuff!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest place I have ever been. Went for an early meal with my kids. Waited at the door for 5 mins before the lady said to sit anywhere. We started to walk around and 80% of the tables had dirty plates or food on the tables. There was only two people eating there. Decided it was not worth it so we left."}
{"text":"My go to place for breakfast now.  The service is very friendly and fast.  Love the classic breakfast with poached eggs and the potatoes.  Will go back to try other things on the menu for sure."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8pm-ish on a Sunday evening.  There was only one other table of customers, so we received prompt and attentive services.  We ordered a grilled haddock dinner and a roast beef dinner.  Food arrived quickly.  Everything was generously portioned.  The roast beef was good - loads of beef and gravy.  They agreed to pour extra gravy on the fries, so we effectively got a poutine, san cheese, for free (scored!).  The haddock turned out to be pan fried not grilled, so boyfriend felt cheated.  Other than this, fish tasted good."}
{"text":"The burgers was good and the size of the patties cut in two you can make a double burger. But I have to say why did the staff and some of the patrons kind of weird. #keepinit100 for real. 

The place does provide us great memories growing up rummaging the neighborhood in our teens.  Any who the food is good but I would recommend a different location."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast special Mon - Fri before 11am. Love the fish and chips with their homemade tartar sauce is dynamic! I think its family owned and operated too which offers a very friendly atmosphere. The burgers are massive and delicious. I really do enjoy this place and definitely recommend it for those greasy spoon lovers like myself!"}
{"text":"Just a quick update to my previous review...Went back for another burger. This time I asked not to cook the burger all the way so that it will remain juicy. The waitress happily communicated this to the kitchen and voila! Juicy burgers!!  I also noticed that it was not the same cook as last time, so maybe that also played a role, but either way, has a great meal and service, just needed to say what I wanted."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable, and common fare as expected.  Service was average.  

*Beware liquor tax on your bill if you order ginger ale, they regard this as an alcoholic beverage."}
{"text":"I happened to take two coworkers here at Wimpys after an overnight shift on a Sunday morning.  I ordered the chocolate french toast and it was OK.....nothing special about it. It was not sweet and the bread was kinda soggy.... So I was a bit disappointed and upset at myself for giving their french toast a try.  My coworkers were happy with their big breakfast combo, so my visit was not a complete disaster.  Price wise, I paid 46 dollars for all our meals and that is with the tip ,  so the prices are decent. The waitress was polite and the food arrived fairly quickly.  Would I visit again? Yes! I will probably order their burgers or big breakfast combo the next time I visit. In my opinion, stay away from the French Toast because it will only disappoint you :(."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Decent breakfast. Their burger is disgusting in my opinion, as its extremely thin and tastes like meat loaf. I know a lot ofpeople like it because it's big but I think it's gross. Service is good. I'd go for their fries and gravy, or for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good place for diner food. 

Burger bigger than the bun. So I end up eating the burger off the sides before diving in

If you get the pancakes, they are thick and filling. I was unable to finish it"}

{"text":"Driving in circles deciding to have breakfast or wait for lunch.  Brunch?
I wanted to go to a Family 88 restaurant or something like that, but it was closed for some reason or another until Nov 16th (or 18th), so went to Shopsy's - haven't been there in a loooooog time.  And it will be another long time since it was closed.  Ended up at Wimpy's.  Nothing too brilliant to report.  Just another american breakfast and off I went to fill my day with activities.  
As you know, this place is littered with old posters and memorabilias.  One thing that caught my eye was a tootsie roll add.  I do believe that the Political Correctness peeps would have field day with it.  Check my photo posting of it!"}
{"text":"I come to this location often because it's very close to my house. The staff are always very friendly and the service is always amazing and fast. The portions are huge and there are so many awesome choices on the menu that I always have trouble deciding.

Some of my favourites are the western omelette, the club sandwich, chocolate chip pancakes, strawberry french toast, the five star combo and of course the burger which is humungous. I usually get the smaller size. I also recently tried the eggs Benedict and it was wonderful! 

The decor is also awesome! So much fun stuff to look at on the walls.

I will always come back here. My go to for a quick, large and awesome breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wimpy's is a franchised restaurant, and the owner of this particular Wimpy's is one of the most friendly, helpful gentlemen you will ever meet. He's been there almost every time I go, and each time he has welcomed me with a friendly smile and a greeting. The servers are also very friendly, and even the cook says hello and asks us how our meal was. The theme is 1950's, a theme I personally love, and the decor is clean, fun and interesting to look at, definitely kid friendly. As for the food, you cannot beat what you get for these prices - it's delicious! 

I love their breakfast, and for their dinner options, I've had the chicken fingers, and they definitely give me more food than I can eat, which is great for leftovers. As for their burgers, which they are famous for, I am not a fan. To me, they taste rubbery and have little spice for your palette, so I stay away from those, but there is so much to choose from, I really don't mind. I'd say a lot of the items on the menu are LESS than $10.00, which is great for my wallet. I would recommend Wimpy's to anyone who wanted good food for a good price."}
{"text":"First time here, we actually went because we couldn't find any ph? in the area and while this is an odd choice, it was close and we wanted food.

Walking in, the decor was very, colourful? Not a huge fan. It was pretty cold to be honest. We had to keep our jackets on and that just makes it harder to eat.

The menu was surprising, as someone with all the food allergies, there were lots of choices. I went for the caesar salad with chicken and my gf had the junior cheeseburger.

The salad was decent, not my favourite dressing and way too many croutons (I always forget to ask for no croutons), chicken was cooked well. The cheeseburger looked ok, didn't come with any vegetables which was odd.

Our server was pretty friendly. Overall it was decent. Nothing terrible, but nothing special."}
