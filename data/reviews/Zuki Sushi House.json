{"text":"This was probably one of the best sushi places I've been to. It's a small restaurant, but the quality is impeccable. I had the spicy kani roll while the friends I was with had the bridge. The setup of the bridge was adorable! Service was great, and the sushi rolls were delicious. I'd highly recommend trying the spicy kani or spicy tuna rolls, as those were our favorite. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"After eating at almost every sushi spot in Cleveland, it is awesome to have one that is local to me. The chef started out in New Orleans and has been making sushi for ten years. He really does an excellent job with the rice, which, believe it or not, is the true backbone to good sushi. It is not too sweet or too sour and is cooked with just the right amount of \"bite\" so that you can actually taste the texture of the grains. They use high quality rice.  

Was pressed for time so had take out. Regular sushi dinner and chicken pad thai along with a rainbow roll. All the sushi was spot on. As I watched the chef, we chatted, and I could tell he was not only skilled, but paid attention to detail in forming the rice and placing the fish. The rice to fish ratio was ideal in the rolls and the sushi. Nothing worse than getting a big honking mound of rice with a tiny piece of fish. The sushi dinner came with miso soup or clear soup (mushrooms and fried onions) and salad. I had the miso. Nicely done. Not too salty. The salad was iceberg (fresh and crispy), but the standard dressing was really good. Nicely in balance. Not sure if they offer a japanese salad. The pad thai was very good. Not drowning in sauce or with a funky color that can just ruin it. Nice balance of fish sauce, sweetness and citrus. Rice noodles where not overcooked and still had some texture too them even though I did not eat until I got home. All the takeout packaging was secure and neatly packaged. Noticed that the menu had hibachi (cooked in the kitchen, not table top), based on my experience with the pad thai, I would try it next time. 

The place is small (six or seven tables? and a small sushi bar, five or six seats?) but nicely decorated and clean. The staff really went out of their way to make me comfortable, answer my questions and point out unique items based on my preferences. All despite the fact that I was just getting take out. And the best part, highly reasonable prices for the quality. The menu is not overwhelming, but they do have a unique selection of rolls and a fair amount of hot food. I would have to assume that if business booms the sushi offerings would expand (they do have almost all the standards plus a few more options for the adventurous). If I could critique one thing, it would be the wasabi. Feel like it could have been firmer and hotter. It was serviceable though. Pickled ginger was pink, not yellow. Standard, but not amazing. I prefer the yellow. 

My take away, Zuki is legit. If my subsequent experiences are as good as my initial one, I will be a regular. I was hesitant to write this review because this place appears to be a hidden gem and it is small. I want to keep it all to myself (and just roll in on a Friday night and actually get a seat), but the food was just too good not to give them the props they deserve. On a price to quality ratio, this place is off the chart."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of the food. Owners are always welcoming and have great recommendations. Very glad to see the popularity of this restaurant growing"}
{"text":"Out in Twinsburg for work and wasn't expecting to find a well reviewed sushi restaurant but glad I did.  It was quite busy for a Monday and the poor waitress was slammed but the sushi chef stepped in to help and was very friendly.  The presentation and flavors were great."}
{"text":"Moved to area over a year ago and was pretty bummed to have to drive a ways in any direction to find decent sushi. Just decent. No more! Ordered a sushi dinner to go here, and it was AMAZING. Huge pieces of fish for the sushi, great service, so excited to have found them!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight with a girlfriend. SO GOOD. Fresh, delicious and creative sushi. I had the Beauty and the Beast roll and it was amazing. I'm a huge sushi fan and this is some of the greatest sushi I've had. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  Great selection of sushi especially the specialty rolls. Has other great options as well if you are not a sushi person. My new go to sushi spot! Exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi restaurant.  A lot of creative rolls.  Great customer service.  The owners actually take the time to come over to see how your meal was."}
{"text":"I love these guys. The owners run the food and the floor. They are extremely nice, remembered my name, and make the most incredible sushi. I told them to keep it small and keep doing what they're doing. You may have to wait a moment to get your food but it is highly worth the wait. I travel for work and always try the local sushi. This is the best I've had. Try the Beauty and the Beast. This is my new found Love. If you're searching for another, try land & sea, but the Beauty and the beast is just.. so... perfect.. in every way! Gosh I love you guys. I'll be back to Cleveland if only for this."}
{"text":"As other reviewers stated, this place is so unassuming you would drive right past without giving it a second look. After eating there, I have to say that this is now our favorite sushi restaurant in the area. We love sushi and used to go to another restaurant because of THE MOST amazing sushi chef, Sam. Since he left to head back to his home in Laos, the place he worked at just hasn't been the same. Well...we found our new place.
Zuki is a small restaurant but clean and tastefully decorated. The entire staff was so welcoming and we were greeted the moment we walked in.
After the amazing seaweed salads and Wonton soup, we started with the Signature roll and the Volcano roll. Both were incredible with the most beautiful presentation. They even included a cute palm tree with shells as a garnish (see photo).
The rolls were so good, we wanted to try more so we ordered the Fujiyama roll and the Tuna Martini. A great highlight is that you can actually see the sushi chef, Jin (who we found out later is the owner) carefully create the rolls. As you can see from the other photo, the presentation on the Tuna Martini was over the top spectacular.
I should note that all the sushi was extremely fresh (brought in daily) and the sear on the tuna was perfect. 
We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Really good sushi and not too expensive!  The owner is really nice.  It's nice to have a local sushi place that is actually worth going to.  We definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and great service! We had the tempura and shumai appetizers and a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls. All delicious and very fresh! One of us tried the chicken hibachi--very generous portions and very tasty. Our server and chef were friendly and attentive. From the food, to the service, to how they plate the food, you can tell they care about their customers. So happy to have a great sushi place in Macedonia now. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A fairly new restaurant to the Macedonia area, but the food is absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend and I went in around 5:30 on a Wednesday and were the only people dining in, but there were a lot of carry-out orders being picked up while we dined, which may be seen as a \"good sign\". We were served a tempura appetizer on the house which was very nice and delicious. An overall 9/10 experience (because no one is perfect haha). I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is located in an unassuming white, nondescript plaza on the side of the road in Macedonia. If I didn't find it on Yelp, I wouldn't have even thought to try it, but I'm really glad I stopped in! 

Stopped in for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty busy and the poor waitress was alone, working her butt off inside and takeout orders. While it's pretty small inside, I was really impressed with her work ethic and providing good service even though she was slammed. 

This place is insanely cost effective, especially if you go at lunch! For 5 people to eat, we spent $60, getting a sushi roll to start, everyone getting a meal, and two desserts to finish! 

We got a spider sushi roll for $10 and it was delicious! Crab, avocado, cucumber, rolled to perfection. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box that came with a lot of food for the price! It was around ~$8 for the box and came with chicken, rice, soup, 3 California rolls, and 3 little fried dumplings. Too much food to eat in one sitting, but it was so good that I did anyway. 

We finished with green tea ice cream, with a little whipped cream and chocolate on top in a cute little sundae cup. 

All in all, I would say it was definitely worthwhile to stop in and I can't wait to go back and try more sushi!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. What a great find. This is great sushi with fresh fish and some great specialty rolls. My go to spot now"}
{"text":"The Sushi is phenomenal! Very nice atmosphere and the owner goes out of his way for perfection. This will be a place I frequent often! The potions are surprisingly large for a small walk-in restaurant."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go to a tiny sushi place in Macedonia, and I probably wouldn't have were it not for the stellar reviews. 

But they were so, so right!

Zuki is small, the decor is very pleasant, and its so clean. The people working there are really nice, and even the menu was impressive (sleek, black, high quality).

The quantity, quality, and prices really are outstanding. I love sashimi, and nothing tasted old or off. In fact, everything was fresh, nicely plated, and the portions were generous. The prices are competitive with other good sushi places in the area. 

If you check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food. Beautiful presentation and very friendly staff. The inside is not big; but it's cozy inside. I thoroughly enjoyed my sushi and my 4-year old liked his sweet and sour chicken! We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a cute but small unassuming little shop run by Chinese people.   Perhaps it was the day of the week we went (Saturday), but my sashimi was not very fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the calamari salad appetizer though. It was not overdressed or over seasoned like at most places. For the price, this place is worth another try. My sashimi lunch special was $10 for 9 pieces including a soup (or salad). The atmosphere is nice, and presentation was cute as well."}
{"text":"We tried Zuki because Of the reviews and thank goodness we did! When I saw this place I vowed to never go to a tiny sushi place in a worn down plaza. This is now our favorite weekend dinner spot. It's a tiny place that is always full so be prepared to wait, but the sushi is fresh, you can eat Hibachi without walking out smelling like the place (they cook it in the kitchen instead of in front of you), and the owners are friendly. They serve pretty good sake as well."}
{"text":"Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the size- not an ideal place for big dinner parties. About 8 tables in the restaurant. Other than size, this place is wonderful!!! I have been struggling trying to find some good sushi around town and I have found my new favorite place! Absolutely delicious and I have a feeling I'll be ordering take out once a week from here! The service was great and staff are so friendly-which is a must for me!"}
{"text":"I didn't think any place could top Toko but this exceeded expectations!   So good, nice place, Nice owners.  This will be a frequent place for us.  
Update 1/6/18....back again. This pic doesn't do this presentation justice.  AMAZING and SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Oh my!!! What a place. It is a cute little sushi place with 5 star quality all around. The sushi master who makes all the sushi by hand right behind the bar is an artist with his food. Every roll of sushi I have ordered has been outstanding. I keep going back, slowly trying every one on the menu. The Lemon salmon roll is the best.  It is a great experience and a must try."}
{"text":"Love the service and excellent food!! Always fresh and friendly people. Have gone several times my kids also love it!"}
{"text":"Very small place that is extremely busy. The table wait was about 15 minutes we ended up taking a two top and added a chair for three people. Selection is big and gives kids a opportunity to eat general Tso chicken and other American Asian cuisine. Two sushi chefs make it at least a half hour wait for dishes. The sushi was fresh and excellent. I would have taken pictures of the food but we where so hungry we ate quickly.  I would not pass this up unless you are famished."}
{"text":"Great! Had the eel with rice and it was amazing! Waitresses were very nice and the food seemed (at least to my untrained eye) quite authentic. Will be returning for sure. 

Wouldn't recommend bringing kids or groups."}
{"text":"Traveling and looking for good food.  Drove by this place the first night.  \"Sushi, but it looks sketchy\" and ended up going to another place.  Next night I read the reviews of this place and went in.  It is great!!!  Go!  Clean, friendly and everything we ate was awesome.  Sushi, bento boxes, crab rangoons!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a sushi place that is good in my area. We went to Zuki, best sushi i have had since we moved from California in June. Staff and service is great. Food was delicious. Will go back soon for sure. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Got in late from flight.  Didn't know where to eat.  I always enjoy Japanese food, but in Ohio.  It had 4 stars so I decided to go for it.  First the miso was excellent.  Perhaps the cold weather outside made it taste that much better.  Next, the roll was also equally excellent.  Finally, the Sashimi plate was the icing on the cake.  Very nice little establishment.  Will definitely come back to eat if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have Zuni Sushi house in our neighborhood! I have not yet dined in but have ordered out a bunch of times. Sushi and sashimi are quite fresh!  My favorite is the jalapeño yellow tale- very Nobu-ish!  So proud of Macedonia- this is a cultural upgrade.  And to boot- they have great unfiltered sake!   We will be sure to come quite often."}
{"text":"Really impressed!  The sushi is delicious. So excited that we have a quality sushi house about 2 minutes away from our home. The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"We liked Zuki so much that the experience prompted me to make my first Yelp post. I judge a Japanese chef by the tempura and it was perfect as was the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"The only places I ever think about getting sushi is downtown or in another town. Then I remember this place in town and I haven't been there yet. I am sure glad that I did. I got the monster roll, foreplay roll, and Christmas roll. All amazing! I know I will be back and the best part is it is only five minutes away. Lastly I went when they said it would be ready and they were just finishing up. Freshness is key with sushi!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Monster roll is one of my new favorites in addition to the General Tso chicken. Recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi Restaurant I have been to since Virginia Beach.  So so good. We are going almost every week!  So happy they were open Christmas Eve!  The Christmas Sushi Roll was delicious!  Very small place but so good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. Yummy sushi at a reasonable price.  Great service. We have been here a couple of times and have had a good experience every time. I highly recommend coming here if you are close by."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch.  We ordered the bento boxes and the food was good.  The salad dressing is fair and lacks flavor.  I would not recommend the hot tea.  There is a very off-putting taste from the tea itself or the plastic mugs that they serve it in."}
{"text":"Unreal place. Food was delicious. The owners are great people. Highly recommend going here! The sushi was the best I've ever had !"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING. Point blank. Great owners that are so friendly and welcoming, great sushi and you can tell it's made with care, great food from the kitchen. BEST CRAB RANGOON I HAVE EVER HAD (and that's saying a lot). Service is a little slow, simply because there is only one waitress, and she owns the place. Good food takes time. HIGHLY recommended. Small place so dont bring a big crowd, but it's such a great spot. Carry out is always spot on as well. I can't say enough good things. Check them out."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go because of the previous Chinese place there. This place is amazing. We finally some good sushi in Macedonia. Food is great and so is the staff. Sushi rolls are very unique. Was not a huge fan of the General tso but everything else was fantastic"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and both times the sushi has been very very good. I also tried their orange chicken lunch special that was flavorful and served with rice. 

The menu consists of appetizers, sushi, entrees, hibachi and they have lunch specials. The hibachi I have not tried and is not cooked in front of you which can be a plus so you don't leave smelling like it.

The place is small and if going at dinner time expect to wait but it is definitely worth the wait.
I know, I know sushi from a resturaunt in a plaza? The answer is Yes! You will not be disappointed. Or don't go that's okay more for me. (Insert emoji with tounge sticking out and silverware in hand)"}
{"text":"really good sushi, quick, cozy and cheap. the pork dumplings are so good although i'm allergic. The Philadelphia roll exceeded expectations by far. The waitress was awkward and made us uncomfortable because she whispered like the asian girl off of pitch perfect we could barely hear her."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh flavors!  Fast and friendly service. Sushi great. Seafood soup tasty. Seaweed salad yummy. Excellent quality.  Five stars."}
{"text":"The food is very good and price is not expensive. The sushi is fresh and taste delicious. I also ordered hibachi and the steak is great."}
{"text":"So fresh and yummy and tasty!  Have been here 3 times lately and as soon as I eat my food (have always gotten take out) I start think about when I will come back again.  Reasonably priced and the dining room is usually very busy so others must agree with me!  Even if you dont care for sushi, there are more traditional items on the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it to come eat here. The food is amazing and the presentation is beyond great! They make it into a work of art. They're very friendly and welcoming. The lemon salmon is DELICIOUS! I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Great food comes in small spaces. The food is fresh and tasty. We had the Love Boat for 2. It was just the right amount of food.  While we were there, we saw half a dozen to go orders, carefully packed.  I heard at least four languages besides English so the menu appeals to many. We will definitely return. I do suggest a reservation. With only 22 seats plus 6 at the sushi bar, it can get crowded in a hurry."}
{"text":"Relocated to Cleveland this past year and have been looking for a good sushi place not too far from Twinsburg. Eureka! The wife and I both agreed this is the spot. The chef has great attention to detail and it shows up in the flavor and presentation of what he serves. The rice is the perfect texture and flavor and they have unique roll selections. I would call the pricing reasonable compared to most sushi places in the area. They don't serve beer right now because of archaic Ohio alcohol laws (chef said he wants to get the license), but they do have wine and sake. The Sho Chiku Bai nigori sake does just fine. It's a small location so arrive early or be prepared to wait, especially now that word is getting out about this place."}
{"text":"What a treat!!! So impressed with this new little spot. Wonderful presentation. Delicious sushi. Such nice friendly husband/wife owners. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!!  The food is excellent, reasonable and best of all the owners are really cool people.  I don't often leave a review, but these guys deserve this...    You don't need me to tell you this...  they will be very successful on their own.   See for yourself and check them out!!  YUM-MY!!!!!"}
