{"text":"Cool spot, very friendly and attentive service, and super flavourful dishes! Meat cuts are a bit rough and fatty but servings are well portioned and delicious! Some of the tastes definitely brought me back to Vietnam street food..."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly partial to Vietnamese food but this place is amazing. Have been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks (all takeout). First 2 times we had the pho bo - really flavourful broth and they pay a lot of attention to how they pack it to go. Last time we branched out and ordered  the banh xeo, pok pok wings, and pho bo ko (?). The wings and pho bo ko were amazing! I'll definitely include one of the two on all future orders.  As for the venue, staff are friendly and the kitchen is right in front of you. This makes waiting for your food to be prepared very entertaining. So happy this place is in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Vit Beo has a cool vibe and visually appealing food. However, there are a few issues that need corrected. 1) the salt levels in the shrimp and wings are unacceptable. Who's idea was it to make them this salty? 2) the spice levels are too mild. The pepper slices were from some non hot chili. I don't think this would fly in Vietnam. 3) the beef in the noodle dish was dry and tough. Maybe a longer braise is needed. And lastly, the restaurant was freezing. I know that heat escapes through large glass storefronts but the heat should be cranked or space heaters utilized to compensate. This said, the staff was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure what the concept is , nothing you couldn't get at any other Vietnamese restaurant for a lot cheaper   Note the ventilation is poor inside so if you have other plans after dining there I would advise having a change of clothes . The place absolutely wreaked of nuoc mam (fish sauce) and the food was extremely salty."}
{"text":"Everything taste like fish sauce. I've ordered multiple dishes over several occasions and each time with a new chef in the kitchen. I was dismayed but hopeful until everything tasted like fish or soya sauce."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Taste: 2/5 Price: 1/5  Chicken wings- dry, extremely salty. I could not continue eating after barely having to finish one piece. $12 for about six pieces. Prawns - once again, extremely salty, didn't have much flavour. $12 for 6 pieces. Cauliflowers- probably the best dish of the three but $8 for a handful of cauliflowers, I wouldn't come back for it."}
{"text":"Nice little new spot on Bloor & Ossington. Menu is small but not overwhelming like other Pho spots. We had the Chao & Pho Bo.. both were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Been there twice already the last 2 weeks and loved every dish. The food and service was fantastic, and I'm so happy it's open late nights. My only wish is that it was a little warmer inside. Definitely chilly if sitting close to the window.  I had these items:  Dumplings - golden and pan fried to perfection  Pho Bo Ko - the taste of lime and tamarind were so enticing, although the stewed beef could have been a tad bit more moist... I would definitely still have this dish again  Seared beef with watercress - beef was so tender and delicious  Also had green papaya salad and banana flower with chicken. Both were extremely flavourful and showcased the ingredients wonderfully.  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the dishes!"}
{"text":"I would call this place Vietnamese-inspired food versus actual Vietnamese food, despite the authentic names on the menu.  Great service, really nice people!! Odd hybrid restaurant/takeout counter set up.  Bo Kho was really really salty, banh xeo is a loosely interpreted version, bo luc lac lacked flavour but the greens were yummy.  The fried shrimps were AMAZING, a really bright spot on the menu.  Pricey for the small portions."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on it being featured on a local blog site. I haven't had the best luck with Viet-Fusion types of places but the food looked great and there were some classic dishes on the menu that caught my eye like Banh Xeo and Bo Luc Lac.   Service:  I think they are still trying to figure out the service model. It's small space with only about 14 high top seats. You order from the counter and they bring you the food.   Ordering and paying was simple but food all came out at different times and took a little long which I guess is standard for tapas, however, not standard for a traditional vietnamese joint. If you're not sharing, I recommend telling them that you want everything at once.   Overall, service was okay. I'll chalk it up to it being a new place and them still ironing out some kinks. Not a big deal.  Food:  We had the Banh Xeo, Bo Luc Lac and the Pho Bo Kho.   Two things you need to remind yourself to avoid extreme disappointment: portions are smaller size and dishes are modern interpretations, despite the authentic Vietnamese names on the menu.   Although modernized, the authentic flavours are there. They used tenderloin for the Bo Luc Lac so the meat was tender and cooked perfect med-rare. The acidity of the watercress salad cut through the meat nicely. The Pho Bo Kho was a good interpretation with nice chewy, thin rice noodles and leaner cuts of meat. The Banh Xeo was a disappointment only because I was looking forward to the traditional crispiness of the Banh Xeo accompanied with fresh herbs which is the hallmark of this dish. This version was more like a salad roll.   Overall: Here's why I'm happy we tried Vit Beo but why we were left wanting and will not return.  The menu reads like an authentic Vietnamese restaurant serving up traditional dishes but we have read reviews describing it as \"Vietnamese street food\" or \"Vietnamese tapas\".   I should note that the adjectives \"Vietnamese street food\" and \"Viet tapas\" are from reviewers and not from Vit Beo itself. Although, herein might lie the problem. Vit Beo, to me, doesn't yet know where it fits in the food scene. As such, its customers may be confused.  We went in expecting either homely dishes shared in abundance (Vietnamese), or cheap eats eaten in unassuming surroundings (Street Food), or more subtle bites slowly consumed in a cozy atmosphere over drinks and conversation (Tapas). I think I would have been happy if even one of these experiences was met.  However, the portions were small relative to the price and although after each bite I thought \"this tastes good\", my next thought was \"I could have gotten 'just as good' down the block at a traditional Viet joint for less money and for nearly twice the portion size.    As for being a Viet tapas joint, I wasn't feeling it. Through the layout and lighting I felt like I was sitting at a deli counter - somewhere I wanted to order, pay, eat, leave; not somewhere I wanted to savour small bite after small bite along with a beverage (or two...three...). This feeling was reinforced with the people queuing up to order at the counter just feet from you and with having to get up to go to the counter to get things like sharing plates, cups, etc....   The most unfortunate part is that despite there being dishes that showcased some culinary vision and talent in pushing the frontier of Vietnamese cuisine while respecting its heritage and flavours, on our drive home from Vit Beo this was overshadowed by jokes about the looks on the faces of the other customers when their small $14 bowl of Pho arrived or about how there were at least two other people (including ourselves) on their phones during dinner researching where to go to nearby afterward to get full.   In fairness, for similar reasons to the above, I've yet to find a fusion Vietnamese restaurant that works. If anyone has any suggestions in the Toronto area, I would love to hear about them. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho, unsure why people are saying so salty. Wings were perfect. Price is right. Staff are nice.  More of a dine and roll experience. I would go for a long date."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Nice staff, amazing washroom pho wallpaper.  Pho Bo Broth is the most bland I've ever tasted. Added a ridiculous amount of hot sauce to attempt to create flavour. Meat cuts not great. $13.56 is absolutely ridiculous. For the size, portion, etc...  I like the simple menu, the pho is the 2nd worst or worst I've ever consumed."}
{"text":"loved the food & low key atmosphere. loved being able to get good food late night in that neighbourhood, saved me from another guilty trip to mcdonalds. tried a few things, all different flavour profiles, generous portions, food came out quick. washed it down with a light beer. v happy"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've eaten everything on the menu and enjoyed it all. My favourite item is the kho quet - fried cauliflower in a caramel fish sauce. Service is friendly, atmosphere is great. Every person that I've brought in has become a fan. I'm really happy that this place has become a part of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is a cozy spot to grab a drink and boost your sodium intake. I get that bar foods are typically salty to go with beer but this was just a bit too salty, especially since my friend and I were mostly there to try the food.   This is a small place with less than 20 spots to sit. You order over the counter and the food will be delivered to where you're sitting. You don't get a number or anything so it's simply based on the waiter's memory or calling out your name. The staff was very attentive to remove any empty plates off as soon as we were done with them since the tables were quite narrow. My friend is allergic to peanuts and they were able to remove the nuts from the chicken wings. They forgot to remove the peanut from the green papaya salad the first time, but was happy to take it back and make a new batch.  The flavors of the dishes here are very different from the other more typical Viet places. Maybe it was the unfamiliarity, but I didn't quite enjoy it as much. The green papaya salad was very different from what I was expecting. I was expecting a refreshing salad lightly dressed with lime and fish sauce mixture, but their version here was mixed with a soy based, strong dark sauce. It was very salty, and the freshness was drown out. The cucumber in there was able to stand out against the sauce, but the papaya was completely lost. The beef jerky was chewy and didn't really have a flavor of its own.   The first bite of the wings was really good, loved the fried bits of garlic and fresh chili and green onion on top. Then it got a bit too salty. For the fresh roll, you can really taste the prawn and the crispy rice crepe gives a nice crunch, but the pork belly was a little lost on me.   If you're trying this place, maybe try the other items on the menu and skip the green papaya salad."}
{"text":"Pretty much a hipster viet take out place. Small location. Not so much a restaurant since there are only 3 bar tables. Got the beef pho and friend got the pok pok wings. Pho was $12 so that's a little more than most pho places. Portion was ok. Not very big. But soup was pretty good. The wings were so good i got another box for take out. I would come back to try other things on the menu and for more wings."}
{"text":"If u like Vietnamese food u will love the food here. Great creations such as the cauliflower (Kho quet ), dry noodle dish (Pho Bo Ko) and crepe. (Banh xeo). Great valued food! And great friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Tapas style dishes, I like the spiciness level they used. Standouts were the Pok Pok Wings and the Bo Luc Lac. We ordered one of everything cause there were 5 of us, but I think we should have gotten multiples of some stuff. Hard to discern portion sizes/numbers."}
{"text":"The food here is so salty, the amount of salt is probably saltier than the Dead Sea. My friend and I spent a good amount of time talking about how salty our foods were. I don't think any of our sentences lacked the word \"salt\". The food isn't bad, it was tasty and lots of flavour but portions were really small; if I came here on an empty stomach I probably would've had to spend a good $50.   I ordered the wings and the dry beef noodles. Surprisingly the noodles had a little kick to them which was nice. My friend claimed the noodles to be too spicy for her liking, even with the little portions it came as. Wings were so good, would've been even better with rice since it was, you know, so salty.   My friend got the spring rolls which were really good, but again--salty. She said the saltiness mainly came from the meats which is why she had to wrap the spring rolls with the lettuce it came with on the side to ease the saltiness. She also got the papaya salad which was salted with tasteless but salty sauces jerky. Honestly everything at this place was salty too the max, if it wasn't for the water we got at the end of our meal I would've dried up into a prune.   On the bright side, service was awesome. Even though the joint was order food at the cash, the \"cashier\" would come around the (small) store picking up your trash or take away your empty dishes. It was really nice of him and he really did make the stay a little better. Now, would I return? Probably not. There are better Vietnamese joints in the area at better prices with better portions so I'll have to pass on this place."}
