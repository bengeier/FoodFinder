{"text":"I had high hopes for this place to get a break from the boring airport fare. Alas, it failed me. The place opened three weeks ago and I hope they figure things out.  The menu is quite basic with sandwiches and salads. I'm not much into meat as of late and the three salads didn't sound appealing. I ordered a Portobello sandwich, no garlic mayo and a side of fruit. It came out and I scanned the sandwich. It had a healthy amount of greens and roasted peppers and mayo.... I pushed it aside. No one came. I flagged the attention of someone, who said they must have mixed up the order.... I ate the fruit cup while waiting. The fruit had been cut up for a bit, not the most fresh, but it'll do. After I finished the fruit, the remade sandwich arrived. It was clear less TLC was put into the remake. The mushrooms were quickly cooked and the water and oil wasn't filtered before placing onto the sandwich. Soggy mess.  Tip: sandwiches include a side of chips or fruit. The chips were bags of chips. Hmm.... The only real local flare were the beers.   Overall, I left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"I got to sample their Mister Rogers grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup as part of a Yelp tasting event.  I myself was not a fan of the grilled cheese. To their credit, it was grilled perfectly, and super cheesy; I just didn't like the flavor combo.  The tomato soup on the other hand was DELICIOUS!! It was umami on my tongue and actually made my mouth water when I was eating it. It was tangy and tomato-ey and fresh. I would eat a gallon of it!   I also LOVE the exterior and interior of the restaurant. The lighted sign is modern and super chic, and the industrial decor is just awesome. I love that they put so much time and detail into the design because it blows the nearby eateries out of the water, and lends itself to a cool experience, on top of the food experience.   I will be back because their food execution was perfect; I'd just order a different sandwich! :)"}
{"text":"Another stop we had on our Yelp's passport tour was this place.  For their sampling we had \"Mr. Rogers\" grilled cheese and tomato soup bisque. They used melted brie and apple for this sandwich. I must say it was fresh and different than what you would normally find in a grilled cheese sandwich.  I really enjoyed it. The soup was very good as well.  They are located in concourse A which may be a bit of a problem if your flight is not in that particular concourse. They have both table and bar service. Thumbs up on that grilled cheese. That alone was worth a quick stop here."}
{"text":"If this place was downtown it would be 5 star. The restaurant is good. They have a nice selection of beers and a Pittsburgh feel. The Mr. Rodgers grilled cheese and tomato soup are AMAZING. I if you are traveling through PIT airport it's worth a stop on a layover.  However I took 2 stars because coming here just to visit this restaurant ...sucks. You have to park and this is going to take a while so plan at least 2 hours, go to the terminal show id and get a pass, then you go back  through the terminal across the street and down the hall to TSA alternate check, metal detector, shoes off, Pat down, the you take a trolley ride to the terminal then you can walk through the mall to the restaurant. Takes about a half an hour.  I did go to the Yelp event and know that they will be moving the terminal to make this easier but until then it's just not worth it for a lunch or dinner."}
