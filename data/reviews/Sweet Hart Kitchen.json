{"text":"3.5 stars   We are a gluten free family and were excited to  visit this bakery during our stay in Toronto.  It was a humid and hot day: we walked and walked through the residential area to get to this shop. As we got close to the bakery our 3 year old suddenly felt the urge to go to the washroom and began crying. My husband picked the crying child, went into the bakery, looked around the treats, and hesitantly asked if they could let the child use the washroom. They said no and waited us to order as if nothing else was happening. We were the only customers then.  We knew this was not a restaurant: we as the grown-ups wouldn't expect them to let us use the washroom, but here it was a child crying in tears and asking for the washroom.   We were not familiar with the neighborhood but my husband went out, carried him and ran around to manage to find a washroom for him. We came back and ended up buying $18 (plus a tip) worth of the baked goods and a drink.  The atmosphere and food were nice: I personally liked them as I could taste that they used earth-friendly, good-quality ingredients. My husband said some of them had an odd texture and were \"hard to swallow\" so didn't care for those.  After all we both left with disappointment.  I wish the pleasant young woman behind the counter showed us a tiny bit of sympathy to the situation and helped us to find the washroom nearby at least."}
{"text":"The sweets (snickers bar and pb&j blondie) weren't anything to write home about. I checked in on Yelp and was expecting to get the complimentary treat mentioned but the cashier had never heard of the deal and therefore I did not get anything. If a business has a check-in reward, it should make sure that all the employees are aware of it. I probably won't be back as Kensington has tons of other gems"}
{"text":"Best new vegan / gluten free spot in Toronto! Lots of no bake / raw treats that are naturally sweetened. Beautiful space with so much light, can't wait for their patio to be open too."}
{"text":"Give it up to this cute little shop to change my mind about gluten-free, plant-based eating. I'm not vegan and fortunate enough not to have any dietary restrictions, but I really enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised about how delicious the baked goods were (the chocolate bundt cake was my fav) . It is a food experience that is naturally sweet (refined sugar-free), locally sourced and yummy to the tummy.  Baked goods are not the only thing they sell. Pizza pockets are made in-house with cashew \"mozzarella\", roasted red pepper tomato sauce, and a balsamic reduction. They also have tofu sammies, ice cream sammies, refreshing iced beverages, truffles, and pilot coffee. The decor is just the cutest, with it bright atmosphere and neon signs. I will definitely return and recommend it to all my gluten-free and vegan friends."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo happy I went to check this place out!!!!!  Knowing that I am a fan of pastries, chocolate and vegan cuisine, a friend of mine recommended me this place and well... now it goes directly to my \"favourite bakeries\" list.  The moment you enter the place, you can feel that these people really really like what they do -this is a very cute location, the owners are super welcoming and the pastries are clearly made with a lot of attention to detail and a lot of love.   Julia, one of the owners, greeted me with a big smile and we started to talk about all the yummy things that I could try. My intention was to try a couple of pastries, but I ordered a pizza pocket too because I was so curious about it and I could not help but have one. Finally I decided to have a peanut butter snicker's bar, a mini carrot cake and the pizza pocket. Everything was delicious, no exceptions - my absolute favourite was the peanut butter bar - WHAT A DELICIOUS bite, if I had known it was that good I would have ordered 10 more. This little piece of chocolatey peanut butter delight made my day!!!  Will come back for sure, already planning to take some of my Yelpie friends here because I know they're gonna love it."}
{"text":"We were thrilled on checking this place out and we are very happy for having found a such great vegan bakery!! I asked to one of the founder about their mix and flours used and I'm so happy to hear that they use 100% Canadian (from Ottawa) flours and not any of pre mixed red bob mill products (which I found contain garbanzo fava beans flour) extremely poisoning for me (I have favism). Then the best new is about their creations.. made just by intuition and fantasy. Good job.. just your tiramisu cake as I said .. would be nicer to name moka cake for the consistency, texture and presentation.  And by the way I'm looks forward to taste your coffee!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this bakery, but the service was underwhelming. Perhaps it was a bad day for the staff/owners, but none of them seemed friendly and welcoming. Their answers to my questions about their baked goods were short and abrupt, and none of them had a smile on their faces. I tried the cashew blondie which was relatively yummy (might be too sweet for some) and the decor of the place is really cute."}
{"text":"Cute vegan bakery on the edge of Kensington market. I've been here a few times and have had the cookie dough and the chocolate brownie ($4; I liked the brownie more). I've been wanting to try the snickers bar but they always seem to be out whenever I drop by :( The iced coffee ($2.25) was also good!"}
{"text":"Really great spot. Delicious treats for all - including vegans. Lovely aesthetic. Purchased truffles, squares and donuts."}
{"text":"Looks sweet... But tastes bitter/bland? As a mostly plant-based eater with a huuuge sweet tooth, I've been meaning to check out Sweet Hart Kitchen since it first opened a year or so ago. It's a super cute one room house right next to Toronto Western Hospital. Seating space inside is quite limited - there are two bar stools and a window bench, so max 4-6 people can eat inside. However during the summer there's a larger sitting area outside the front of store.  Today I missed lunch because of hospital craziness and was feeling kind of miserable with all the snow and slush, so decided to eat dessert for lunch lol. I absolutely had to try the cake of the day $6, a peanut butter raspberry jam, completely vegan creation. In addition I picked up the famous Snickers bar, obviously also vegan, made from peanut butter, a date jam, and dark chocolate on the outside. I was a bit surprised by how bland both treats tasted and how bitter rather than sweet the Snickers bar was! The cake of the day had a wonderful, ice cream cake-like texture, but was definitely subtle, not nauseatingly sweet like most cakes out there. I loved the raspberry layer, very refreshing! However, it still threw me off how subtle the taste was. No flavour explosions, that's for sure. The Snickers bar $3 was bitter and I don't think that's an over exaggeration because I think the dark cacao coating was real dark chocolate and healthy as opposed to the sugary chocolate candy type we are usually exposed to.  With a Veg Club membership card I was able to get a 10% discount.  For sure I'll be back at this cute vegan bakery next time I'm in the area, but I probably won't be ordering the same items again!"}
{"text":"I'm a repeat customer. I've even sent my sister here to pick-up treats from my chosen Sweet Hart   Since cutting out sugary stuff like soda or mass-produced chocolate bars / candy / donuts (like Tim Horton's, Starbucks), I've become especially sensitive to how my blood sugar spikes. For some reason, I just don't get the spikes when sweet treats are made with good-for-you ingredients.  These are my stand-outs so far-- Snicker: chocolate and PB; my preferred alternative to a reese's cup or snickers bar. Potent. Instant gratification. Salted Vanilla Nanaimo Bar: dark chocolate layer, coconut cream, dates/almonds/cashews. Deeply satisfying. Raspberry Vanilla Linzers: Light cookie! Yummy vanilla.  I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"I visited this place on their opening weekend and it's the sweetest vegan place I've been too. Sweet decor, very nice and friendly staff (the owners), and I'm usually not a fan of plant based food, but this place broke the rules. Delicious deserts, healthy, made with fresh and organic ingredients, very tasty and don't make you feel 'fat' after eating them. Got the Peanut butter muffin and tastes as good as a regular (non plant based) muffin. Coming back soon for the raw cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The truffles are to die for. Not overly sweet, great bite size and they also offer lots of other treats and drinks. Go support this local gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last Saturday afternoon, it was quiet however their treats looked delicious! I tried their napoleon slice of cake and it was creamy and flavored well. Almost reminded me of eating ice cream -- which was my dream come true as I can not have dairy. I originally came for an ice cream sandwich but they ran out. I hope to pop by again to try them out! I also purchased their no bake hazelnut donut. For me, I could not finish it because it has a odd taste. The service was friendly and the bakery has very clean and airy feel."}
{"text":"With such a pretty Instagram ready setting, I would hope the flavour and service would match a nice atmosphere.  It's quite unlike anything in Kensington.  Instead of the grittier and more urban feel of most spots, Sweet Hart is spotless inside and out with lots of natural light and white washed walls.  It even has it's own cutesy neon sign to snap away.  This is a vegan bakery and similar to the Bunner's right down the street or the Almond Butterfly on Harbord.  Both those spots surprised me on how gluten free and vegan doesn't mean tasteless.  Sweet Hart Kitchen has a beautiful display of their baked goods... lots of variety all looking pretty on varying pedestals.  I was quite intrigued and hopeful... well, unfortunately it seems to be more on the aesthetics and less on flavour and service.  I came on Mother's day in hopes to pick up a few treats to bring back to a few family members to help end the day on a sweet note.  The eye catching blueberry lemon macaroon bites and lemon bars were the more colourful ones so I asked for them to be boxed up.    As the staff starting to pick, I noticed on the platter of lemon bars that 2 of the 6 were smaller and much more darker in shade.  As she lifted the dark yellow one out, I realized why.  It was from an older batch... the edges were more dense and moistened so it was darker and the lemon curd had dried out making it look darker yellow.  I was really disappointed they would serve old items without informing me.  I do get that it's not good to waste food but other bakeries often offer old stale items at a discount or inform people before final purchase.  Even there's a great app called Feedback that specializes in reducing food waste by offering slightly older items at discount.    Not here.. the person replaced the old piece with a fresh lemon bar that matched the other 4 on the plate.  This put a bad taste in mouth... do I feel good offering my family stale older baked goods?  Not at all.  Anyhow, I paid $9 for 2 macaroon bites and 1 lemon bar.  Expensive... definitely not cheap but GF rarely is.  I was hoping that the taste at least matched Almond Butterfly or Bunners.  Sadly they didn't.  At the end of the meal, they were mostly uneaten except for a few forkful and then pushed aside.  Blueberry lemon macaroon bites - Visually quite pretty as it has an amethyst shade with all the coconut pieces sticking out.  First forkful for a little kid who has a sweet tooth was a strong 'No'.  I tried it myself and I realized the concern... the berry note was more similar to a sour underripe blueberry.  Though the sweetness is very minimal, the coconut flavour only briefly in the middle before a very strong vegetal and mildly bitter note came out.  It was also on the dry side and I noticed this more when the little one drank half her milk after the bite.  It wasn't a macaroon or a treat... definitely missing the concept of the macaroon. 2/5  Lemon coconut curd bars - My fear was realized... it was stale.  We touched the top of the curd and it bounced back without a single finger print.  With a fork, you can see the gumminess of the dried out curd.  Oh ... well.  Flavour wise, it was better than the macaroon bite as it didn't have a bitterness.  A more sour than tempered sweet lemon note was prominent.  The base was mostly wet as it was old and didn't have the nice chewiness as some of the other GF bases I've had at Bunner or Almond butterfly.  If it wasn't old, this might have been good.  1/5  Overall, I think if you want GF or vegan, head to Bunners just down the street or go to Almond Butterfly if you dont want to be in Kensington.  There's also Little Pebbles and Blackbird who do amazing baked goods for those who are gluten intolerant or fine with non-vegan offerings.  For the tastier and more pleasant experiences of a vegan or GF offering, I think other places in Toronto are worth the extra $$."}
{"text":"Sweet Hart Kitchen is a vegan plant base bakery near Kensington Market. It is slightly off the beaten path, near the Toronto Western Hospital.   The decor is pinterest chic - white walls, neon lights, patterned wall paper. The bench is filled with cozy cushions.   I have been frequenting Sweet Hart Kitchen ever since it opened a few months ago as it is relatively very close to work. It's one of my favourite place to visit for a guilt free treat.   I tried many items on the menu including snickers bite ($3), energy bite ($3), raw carrot cake square ($4), ice cream sammie ($5), and cake slice ($5-6).  My least favourite are the raw carrot cake square and ice cream sammies. I find the raw flavour unpalatable. The ice cream sammie unfortunately hurt my teeth when I bit into it. It might have harden a little too much in the fridge or freezer. Not a fan.   Aside from the aforementioned, I really enjoyed this unique bakery. Most treats are cashew and coconut base. I highly recommend the rich hazelnut chocolate cake slice. It's creamy, delicious, decadent and surprisingly guilt free.   Pro tip #1: Check in with Yelp for a treat! Pro tip #2: Sweet Hart Kitchen only takes credit card when your purchase is over $5."}
{"text":"I dropped by Sweet Hart Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon to pick up some vegan goodies and pastries with my boyfriend. Looking at the wide selection of goods, we both ordered an everythang cookie and a fudgy brownie to share. Both were delicious and lovely. The decor of the place was definitely pretty, especially the neon sign and the bench with the cushions. It's those little details that made me want to sit there for hours. I also noticed that they had a selection of hot and cold drinks as well as Pilot Coffee.   Overall, service was very friendly, the baked goods were delicious, and the space was easy on the eyes. Would come back for more vegan goodness!"}
