{"text":"It's...okay I guess. But years back, I bought a noodle dish that tasted \"kind of funny\". I was throwing up within half an hour."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait, what seemed to be premade food takes 5mins of walking around to serve. If there is 5 people waiting, it's going to take 25min to get your stuff. Price increase every year, before cost $4 now cost $6. Food quality stays the same, carrot is very bad and everything else is  mediocre. \"Chicken ball\" is just a filler, 90% air and deep fired bread 10% bad chicken. Worth the 5 dollar to me but don't worth an extra.  Ps. Carrot got better."}
{"text":"Spent many a cold november morning getting one of their combos to satiate me for breakfast and lunch as I struggled to complete my CS degree. Luckily enough, they were parked right around the place that CS students at University of Toronto usually parlay - Bahen Centre. I haven't seen them in a year or so, so I'm not sure what happened, but my time at UofT would have been much harder had it not been for their delicious, comforting, very reasonably priced food. Thank you Ken Ho!"}
{"text":"I didn't like it at first. But after I found combo number 8, I have to say it is not too bad at all. At least I can get decent amount of protein and vegetables."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be straight up, it's slop. But it's good slop because I always keep on coming back. It's not great food by any stretch but I'll be walking by. see his truck and say to myself, \"I got a hankering for some Ken Ho's right now.\"  I always order the same thing, combo #9 with rice just so I can get a little bit of everything, so let's break it down. The veg is nothing spectacular, not much in the way of seasoning but stir fried enough. Mind you, because it doesn't have much seasoning it makes a good accomponiment to the other stuff. There's also a bit of curry potatoes, not too much of a curry seasoning but it's there.The BBQ pork is cut thinner then what you would find in most Chinese restos, I'm sure to make it cook faster but that also puts it on the dry side. The beef with oyster sauce isn't too bad, not too salty and pretty moist.  Now onto the \"Chicken Ball\", and I use the term loosely. If you look at the uploaded pic, yes that's pretty much a little finger nail size chicken kiblet but I still like it. A pack of plum sauce on that badboy, yummy!  All this for 4 bucks (well, $3.95, but I don't think I ever got that nickel back) which isn't too bad for a person on a budget. I personally find I can't eat it all in one sitting so I save the rest for later so really, it's only costing me $2 per meal, not bad."}
{"text":"This food truck wins a prize...one that's actually tough to obtain: The Worse Chinese Food I've ever eaten.    Slop is the only way that I can describe it.  I'm not sure if the beef is meant to be ground or sliced, but it's covered in glop.  The breaded thing...I'm not sure if it's chicken or a vegetable.  In addition to the gloppiest, highest-MSG oyster sauce I've ever tasted, there's some other sauce that's salted beyond belief.  Somehow even the rice has a weird off-taste.    It's cheap, but it is truly, truly terrible.  Service is rude.  I just am praying I don't get food poisoning.    #1 Worst.  Chinese Food.  Ever."}
{"text":"Matt's Pick: Combo #7 (Vegetarian) on Chow Mein, $3.95  Ken Ho runs the red Chinese food truck in front of the Bahen Computer Science Building on the U of T campus. Ken has a small menu with about a dozen items. Most of the options are $4 combos consisting of various permutations of BBQ pork, chicken balls, vegetables, beef in oyster sauce, and so on. You choose whether you want it served on white rice, fried rice, or chow mein.  Combo #7, stir fried vegetables, is a decent vegetarian option. For most of the U of T trucks \"vegetables\" just means onions and maybe some wilted greens but at Ken Ho's you get a good mix of properly cooked veg: broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, bean sprouts, red pepper, and Chinese eggplant. Ken Ho's is also the cheapest and least greasy truck.  On the downside, Ken Ho's combos tend to be the most bland of the St. George trucks; you're going to want to pile on the hot sauce and soy sauce. He's not going to win any awards for his food but when you're getting $4 Chinese out of the back of a truck you have to make some concessions with regards to quality.  Overall this truck serves 2-star food but I'll give them 3-stars for cost, convenience, and a good veggy option. A good spot if you're a U of T student but probably not worth it otherwise.  Pro Tip: Make sure to grab a handful of hot sauce and soy sauce; you're gonna need it."}
