{"text":"Ce restaurant est personnellement, pas le meilleur restaurant indien que j'ai manger de ma vie. J'ai commander 50$ de nourriture et c'était teeeeellement décevant, les samosas n'étaient pas frais. Le poulet au beurre, désolé, mais je ne goûtait absolument pas les saveurs de l'Inde à travers ce repas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, and the best butter chicken in the Montreal area. Intimate decor, good service, amazing food. 

The 10$ thali is a great deal, and the konkanee shrimp are delicious.

I love this place."}
{"text":"First time here and went with some of my friends and had a great time. The food was sooo good. I had the tandoori feast for two as I split it with a friend and it was so yummy. The waiter was really nice too."}

Friend got Norovirus from eating there which is due to bad hygiene i.e. urine and fecal"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at tandoori express. Will never come back to this place. Inconsistent quality and questionable business practice.

I've ordered take out many times before but the last two times when I ordered and picked my order, the guy with the beard served me. First, he told me he put the receipt in the bag. I got home and found no receipt in the bag. He's done it twice and each time he told me the receipt is in the bag.

Now comes the food quality, Each time o ordered kebab wraps, they're were very tasty and had a full kebab skewers. This last time, I started eating and could not get to the meat. So I decided to open the two wraps and I was shocked to find out that there is only half skewers in the wraps and the rest was cucumber and onions. Half skewer in a full size wrap!!!

Sorry to say that I will never come back to this place...next time, I will order from tandoori palace, the place I've been to many many times over the years.

I'm posting a photo of the wrap that made me write this review."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find an Indian restaurant in the neighborhood unfortunately this place is the pits...the food is mediocre at best and the price is way too high. For what it is... Avoid and be happy..."}
{"text":"Bonne expérience Indienne en livraison sur ce restaurant. Je ne suis pas un expert mais tout ce à quoi nous avons goûter était très bon et avait beaucoup de goût. Nous avions l'impression de voyager. Nous avons pris un combo pour deux personnes avec plusieurs mets Indiens dedans afin de goûter un peu à tout. Poulet et crevettes braisés, riz basmati, boulette d'oignons frits et accompagnements sauce et légumes. Le prix n'est pas du tout excessif (50$ pour deux) et les portions sont très généreuses. Je me ferais un deuxième avis lors d'une prochaine commande/visite."}
