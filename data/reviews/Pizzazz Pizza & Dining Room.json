{"text":"This is a Cleveland classic. Been around for years. It's not health food, but it's good solid pizza, calzones, and Italian fare. Get the Salad!!! (We call it cheese salad) there is so much prov on there it's insane but it's soooo good. They sell their dressing because people demand it! It's that good. Small wine and beer selection as well. It's almost always busy but worth the wait. They also deliver and offer take-out. Parking is tight but again, worth it."}
{"text":"Nice salads. Take-out service is a bit slow and disorganized. Be prepared to wait longer than they tell you over the phone. Parking is definitely a problem, but I'm not sure what they could do about it. The staff is friendly and courteous. I'd come back for a no-frills meal."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad with  house dressing within a 100 mile radius (at least)."}
{"text":"Love love love pizzazz!!! Always a great choice. Never a bad experience. Always great service!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the location on Fairmont Circle. The location at Mayfield disappoints. Good flavor, but the crust is always undercooked. A lot of young high schoolers trying to flip pizzas quickly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We've been coming here for many years and wonder if they are under new management.  Food was rushed and when we sent it back, we waited and waited.  No bread and then it was thrown at us.  We were surprised at their lack of service and management did not apologize.  Again, very disappointed.  There's a lot of competition and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Want a good pizza? Pick up the phone... and THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW.  Go to Pizzazz!  I believe this place was made back in the time that people were all a foot shorter, or maybe I'm just that tall... but the food is amazing. From their choices of toppings to their wait staff. The girls are friendly and the guys are a bunch of ston---. What? I worked in the biz before. These are the people you want making your pizza.  They make a great white pizza. If you're thinking \"Ah, Alfredo sauce\"  you'd be correct that they have that there, but its not what a real white pizza is; olive oil and garlic. Oh my! (George Takei voice).  Their home made salad dressing (Italian of the sort) is perfect for dipping your crust. Their salads in general are HUGE.  Maybe you're not like me and don't prefer the garden of veggies I order on my pie, but rather be that inner carnivore, then step up to the Cholesterol Monster. More meat than you'll know what to do with.  I've listed that this place is good for everything but late night. Why? Well, they're not open late night, and when isn't pizza a good choice for any meal?"}
{"text":"Been a customer for a long time and have always enjoyed it. Nice to get a pizza with fresh toppings and a lot of it. Not searching trying to find the toppings.  can't get enough of there fabulous house dressing and does make a great dipping sauce for the crust. Have enjoyed there pizza, salads, calzones and dinners. Large portions which either are shared or left over for next day. Pizzazz is a family favorite!"}
{"text":"VERY expensive delivery. Their pasta is microwaved from frozen, the sandwiches are pitifully small. The pizza is good, but pricey. Given the quality and portions of their other options though, it is probably the best bang for your buck.  Delivery fee + 2 person meal will set you back in the 30 dollar range, which is a bit expensive. Drivers will occasionally come to your door (I live in an apartment), but sometimes you're heading downstairs.   They do deliver beer though, which is a plus. Not sure if thats worth the cost of everything else though."}
{"text":"I could drink the Italian dressing. Consistently delicious. A go-to anytime I'm in town!"}
{"text":"terrible customer service! and way too much cheese on a cheap iceberg lettuce salad. this my first time here and my last time"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and even if you are starving.... go anywhere else....    Dark, cramped, dingy and not so clean but I ignored the classic warning signs of a restaurant on the decline and gave them a shot...   Terrible customer service experience.    Now I know why the reviews are saying this place is \"not the same\"..."}
{"text":"We have been faithful to Pizzazz for 20 years. Love getting takeout pizza and Pizazz rarely disappoints. Sheet pizzas are great for family parties. Dinner salad gets thumbs up, too!"}
{"text":"Don't go!  Terrible service.  Stood at doorway for hostess that never showed. Lots of wait-staff passed by; not one made eye contact or said anything that would indicate someone would help us soon. After flagging someone down, we were sat at a table facing the kitchen.  No one came to greet us, offer us water or drink or tell us to go to hell. After what seemed like more than an appropriate time to wait, we left but not before telling them why.  They could not have cared less.  We will spend our money elsewhere.  Oh, and while we were waiting, looking into the kitchen, there's food on the floor, and it looks less than sanitary.  Go someplace else."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the pizza and they never short you on size.  Why more food then you will need.  Great little place!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to find out your kitchen was still open after 9:00 p.m. on a weeknight.  Then were greeted by friendly staff.  Our pasta dishes were scrumptious.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This some of the best pizza in the city I have been coming here for years and they recently added a Gluten Free pizza that is not half bad."}
{"text":"If you don't feel like eating pizza, I highly recommend any salad on the menu.  Their grilled chicken is awesome, and their Italian dressing is killer good.  I forget the name of the salad I ordered but it had salami, ham, and provolone on it and of course I added grilled chicken to it.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken salad to go. When I got to my office ready for lunch I realized the salad dressing was missing. I could not eat the salad without dressing.I called and they said they would send me a gift certificate.  I received it a few days later for 3 dollars. I ordered another salad the following week and brought the  certificate . I told them I was not happy about only receiving 3 dollars. They told me they charge 1.50 for extra dressing so I should be very happy with 3 dollars... and why would I waste a 10.95 salad. MANAGER SHOULD BE FIRED. Never going back."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY BASED ON THE SERVICE!!! The Owner and his wife (VAL) are VERY RUDE...I can promise you that I will NEVER order from this place again and I will tell anyone and everyone that will listen not to order as well. What type of fast food/dining spot threatens a customer who is paying them for food, she threatened to contact a coworker's manager because she didn't like the way a PAYING CUSTOMER was talking to them. Why not tell her mom as well!! Very Unprofessional and I will gladly spend my money at CAPP's pizza or some other place. Btw the only reason she became rude is because Val's rude husband doesn't know how to talk to people. He lacks empathy and for someone who deals with people on a daily, this is unacceptable.  If you don't have patience maybe you should do something else that doesn't deal with people. Just saying...."}
{"text":"ordered take out. the staff was great. order was not right but they sent another order to my home. beyond customer service. I have been going there since 1979 and have never been disappointed. thank you"}
{"text":"We had the white pizza with onions and pepperoni pizza. They give complimentary bread at the start. The white pizza was tasty. My husband told me to order it with onions and tomato. I just chose onions but next time I will order both. (He's from NY and that's how they do it). My husband wasn't overly impressed but I would go back. We went on a Sunday night around 5:30 and were seated quickly."}
{"text":"Pizzazz is a family favorite. We have gone here for lunch at least a half a dozen times, and every time we have enjoyed delicious food and great service. They have great weekly specials, and their salads are to die for. They make their own Italian dressing in-house, but my favorite is the spinach salad with hot pepperoni dressing. We come here often after hiking in the North Chagrin Reservation and it hits the spot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Use to love this place.  Have had 3 recent experiences that tell me things are not the same and it's time to find another pizza joint.  Ordered food for work and everyone complained in one way or another about their meal.  The eggplant parmasan was cruncy (under cooked), the salads were tasteless, the pizza was undercooked and bland.  Not sure what is up with this place but I'm done with bad experiences."}
{"text":"Had them cater a family event and ordered the chicken Parmesan . The order was ready right on time and they also brought it out to the car. Everyone at the party raves about how good the chicken Parmesan  was.  It was very moist and the salad that came with it was great. If you need to cater an event this is the place to go. Prices were reasonable and they have a great menu.   I would not hesitate to use them again"}
{"text":"Fantastic PIZZA! We created or own large za with pesto sauce, chicken, artichoke hearts and spinach and it was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas I've had in a while.   We also split the large ceasar salad (plenty of servings for 3-4 people) and ordered their house italian for the side because it's so damn good.  Ordered their house cocktail it was like a pineapple fusion drink with bacardi - DELISH!  Service was great! Love that it's a little hole in the wall. I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why so many people rave about Pizzazz. It's just pretty darned blah.  Their salads are so cheesey and icebergy that they're hard to stomach. I don't understand shredded cheese on salad. Why? And why so much? If you happen to order a salad that contains chicken be prepared for it to be \"blackened\" aka grossly overcooked. I hate \"blackened\" anything. I thought that craze died in the mid-90's.   The pizza is passable. Not awful. Not great. Just passable. Or mediocre (my fave word lately).   Calzones or whatever you'd like to call them -- extremely blah. I don't even want to talk about them they're so blah.   So as not to be too scathing, I do like one item they serve. I cannot recall the name though. It's much like a sauceless white pizza that's sprinkled with rosemary. Pretty good! Also, their chocolate chip cookies are always some of the best."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place that used to be great now the service was terrible you're always pushed in tables little Room to move the parking is not good and to top it off the pizza so stingy now with the pepperoni and sausage cheese it's not like it used to be the garlic bread is not crispy anymore and the salad that has so much cheese on it that you  have very little salad"}
{"text":"The worst experience I had in terms of customer service. I didn't even eat inside, I had a takeout order. Ordered a dinner and dessert. Didn't give me the dessert. The driver walked off before I could grab his attention (no harm). However, when I called to ask for my money back some cook told me no. I thought he was joking but clearly not. He got pretty mad on when I asked him if anyone actually cares to check a delivery order before it goes out. He said he did personally. I got pretty annoyed at that point. He ended the conversation by saying I can stop by the next day, ask for him, and get reimbursed When I went, he wouldn't speak to me. He must have come to his senses. The lady up front must take customer service lessons from a trap-house, she was equally rude........go figure. So who is your cook to say that you won't correct an error from your end? Typically when people order food, they are hopeful they get what they ordered. I could care less about the mistake but the lack of professionalism on your end as a restaurant needs more help then the taste of your food. Trust me, both are bad. There are too many legitimate Italian restaurants to willingly put up with that. Good luck, you will need all you can get."}
{"text":"If you were a huge fan of this place like I was a few years ago, you need to know things have changed, and not for the better.   The salad used to be crisp and tasty. The cheese was legendary. Now it comes in a small bowl and the cheese is dry and tough.   The pizza used to be absolutely fantastic. Tonight it was flat, tough, doughy, bland, and it actually tasted worse than a cheap frozen pizza from the supermarket.  The cheese turned as chewy as bubble gum as soon as it cooled.   Our kids eat anything. But they took one bite of the pizza and gave up. The wings weren't any better. They were were meatless and way over cooked.   We actually had to go eat somewhere else when we left.   We voiced our disappointment to the waitress and, although the owner was there, he neither came out and said anything to us nor offered to adjust the bill.   $53.00 down the drain!  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their calzones: chicken, mushrooms and pineapple! Yum! My daughter loves the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, not too pricey & a great treat."}
{"text":"Good pizza; not amazing but, pretty good. Family atmosphere and decent parking in the back.  Good sauce. The best part of the pizza was the sausage! So tasty. VERY cheesy but, not too much. Just enough to get a good strand of cheese up in the air and pull it with your fingers.   Enjoyed dinner with the fam here. Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, calzones, garlic cheesy bread.  Can't go wrong with anything.  Nice for take out or eating in."}
{"text":"Terrible! TERRIBLE!! If I could give it negative stars I would. This place is awful!! I was on my way to Columbus from Rochester NY and last year we went to a pizza place in a white building that looked like this. So we thought this was the same place(wrong)! If this was the only place to eat on earth then I guess I would starve to death! The pasta looked gross along with the bread. The salad had more cheese on it then the pizza did and was so unhealthy. Waitress wasn't attentive. Tomatos weren't fresh. They didn't even have Mozzarella! What pizza place doesn't have Mozzarella?!?! Never again would I come here if I'm in the area. Starve to death instead of coming here. Do ur self a favor"}
{"text":"great for an old fashioned no frills italian meal. salads are generally just lettuce, maybe a cherry tomato or slice of onion and a big heap of shredded mozzarella. pizza is decent. pasta is so-so (i got the fettucini alfredo and it was tasty but a little separated).   everything about this place is small - parking lot, driveway, lobby, tables, dining room, servers, and most importantly - prices. definitely worth a trip back (in time)."}
{"text":"Gave pizzaz another try tonight and this will probably be the last time. The pizza was mediocre at best we ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza and then we ordered a baked spaghetti with a house salad. The pizza was very flavorless and caked with cheese and hardly any sauce. But the baked spaghetti was the worst of it all there was hardly any spaghetti in with all this sauce covered in a ton of cheese we definitely won't be back after such a disappointing dinner given all the choices we have in the are."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone, sub, soup, and dessert for delivery. The food was delivered right in the time window even During a horrible blizzard and was DELICIOUS.   Will continue to order from Pizzazz. Fun menu and great prices!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here ever since I was a little kid and I come here almost every time I come back home for a vacation.  Pizzas are always great and oooooohhhhh that house salad dressing!!"}
{"text":"I love Pizzazz... I've been eating here for years. The reason it gets 5 stars instead of 4 is because of their salad dressing. I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. I'm not sure what makes it so great... The italian seasonings or the extra garlic, but whatever it is, I can't get enough. I consider the salad simply a mechanism for me to eat the dressing without using a spoon :)  The pizza is good but not great (probably 3 - 4 star if I just had to rate the pizza)."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times - always good service and good food. Dinner salad with grilled chicken is nothing special but their Italian dressing is what makes it great! I always get the white pizza on wheat crust and it is super yummy! I've ordered Togo with no problems and normally grab a bottle of Italian to take to work for lunches. Small, small place so take that into consideration on busy dinner times."}
{"text":"This place is a treasure and sometimes get a craving for the best grilled chicken salad ever! The pizzas good too but the house dressing makes it superb. I saw they even bottle it now. Very tight parking lot and small area to fine so often order takeout when in the area."}
{"text":"Second time to Cleveland...second time to Pizzazz Pizza. Reading the reviews I'm sad my Cleveland based \"P\" coworkers have had such a bad experience. Us Californians love this place.   The BLT pizza is my favorite, especially on the Wheat crust. I love the atmosphere inside. It's quaint and cozy. This is still a must stop when I'm here visiting."}
{"text":"Wow - this place has changed.  The pizza is OK - but it used to be great.  Ordered some wings Too - was basically a container of oil - totally disgusting.  Plus - I am all for the hole in the wall vibe - but this place is just dirty."}
{"text":"Since I'm a vegan now, the allure of cheese ain't there anymore, but...I'm happy to report that some of my long time faves can be veganized. My beloved spinach and mushroom calzone tastes just as good without cheese. And I now order a mushroom salad without cheese - which is essentially an entire package of mushrooms tossed in with a handful of lettuce. But I really like mushrooms so I can get down with that.  I'm also a fan of their relatively new in-house delivery service. They used to offer delivery through a local food delivery service, but they have their own drivers now. I feel like I get my food in a more timely manner. And my orders tend to be right."}
{"text":"Not the same for sure.  The new owner is so cheap. no meat on the calzone, $5 for delivery, and cutting way back on ingredients. and to top it off, he argues with customers. Take a lesson the from the people who owned and ran the place for 40 years, tr5eat your customers right and they will be loyal, Cheat them, and they wont."}
{"text":"Just ate there with my family of 4, we haven't been there in years, we order cheesy garlic bread, large pepperoni pizza & large house salad, I don't know if they changed the recipe of the sauce but it tasted like canned sweet pasta sauce, the salad was meh, what happened to the fried pepperoni on the salad? I remembered when it had a whole heaping of it, I understand cost cutting but we received 3 slices of pepperoni 1 person went without pepperoni, unfortunately it was me, my wife gave her slice to our daughter, the only thing that I can honestly say was good was the bread that was given in beginning of the meal, cheesy garlic bread had a smidgen of garlic sauce a lot of cheese on it, next time I'll stay going to Joe De's & Antonio's off Chevy Blvd..."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area and came here often with my family as a child. I just moved back here after being away for 12 years and this is the first place I went with my family. The food was just as great as we remembered. I had the calzone named The Gamby and it was great! Prices are more than fair and the service was perfect. The rest of my family loved their food also."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pizzazz since the 70's when it first opened, and I have never once been disappointed.  Everything there is really good, ESPECIALLY the customer service.  One time I had ordered a pizza and by accident they gave my pizza to a take-out order (they do a big take-out business) so I had to wait about 5 extra minutes for their pizza to be done for me.  The wait was minimal, but without asking they gave me the pizza for no charge because of the mistake.  That's the type of high quality service they give.  Maybe the salads aren't that innovative - a nice size bowl of iceberg with a heaping topping of cheese.  But the house Italian dressing is to die for - I've never had a better dressing anywhere else.  All the pasta is good and spicy and piping hot.  The pizzas have a great variety - both red sauce and white pizzas.  The calzones are AWESOME - they have some standard styles or you can pick your own toppings.  My fav - the spinach and cheese calzone with pepperoni.  Piled high with a soft, yet crunchy dough, makes me hungry to think about it!  All served with a side of sauce if you want to dunk.  Yes, as a whole the restaurant is on the small side, but the parking lot has been widened recently and is much more accessible.  There's a good reason that there is always people waiting to be seated - GREAT FOOD!  It brings you back again and again, like I said, I've been eating there at least once a month for 30 years and now I'm driving close to 20 miles just to get there.  IT'S THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great the restaurant is a classic no frills pizza place. When you go just know the parking lot is small and narrow."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of enjoying the pizza from Pizzazz a couple times now at business meetings.  I have never eaten in this location, only had the food.  The pizza is really really good.  Cut into square pieces and with the perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni, I always tend to enjoy it.  The salad is loaded with cheese and olives and fits perfectly with the pizza.  For dessert, my belly always gets happy when it gets to enjoy the delicious canolis!  Is it a little greasy?  Yeah, it is.  Is it yummy?  Yeah, it is.  Sometimes you just want some good, old fashioned pizza."}
{"text":"I've gotten Pizzazz on occasion for work functions 4-5 times and enjoyed it.  It's better then Giorgio's or Dominos but not as good as Beach Club Bistro or even Congin's.  I would have no problem stopping in and picking up something on my way home.  Salads do have the blackened seasoning on the chicken but I'm sure you could get without.  I am considering heading in to the restaurant to dine just so I can feel out the ambiance and service provided.    Some pizza takes a turn for the worse if not eaten straight out of the oven, so maybe this will help Pizzazz's review going forward.  Until then, feel free to pick up some za if you don't feel like driving out of your way for something better."}
{"text":"So we just did take out and ordered online. The food was awesome Pizzazz Salad, Pizza and pasta. It was ready on time we ordered online. We got there early and so we had to wait a few. Sitting waiting for our food you have a direct view into the kitchen. They are busy busy busy and crowded in there. I have to say I saw a guy with long hair and most of the lovely locks were not in the hair net. Another dude had a beard that should have also been somehow contained. 1or 2gals had pony tails also not in hair nets. I don't know about you but finding a hair of any type in my food will deter me from eating there again. I'm happy to say no hair was found in our takeout which I'm very happy to say because I love Pizzazz."}
{"text":"It was okay. I went for lunch. I don't think it's anything to write home about. I had the chicken salad and pesto pizza. The pizza wasn't bad. I wasn't a fan of the crust. It didn't taste like much and was dry. The dressing for the chicken salad was better than most house italian dressings. Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  From what I can tell from the reviews below, I am not the only one that has encountered the horrid service.   I will be going elsewhere here forward. Employees seem bored and disinterested. My order sat at the counter for 5 min while I was in the waiting area and they could not be bothered to check the ready orders to disperse them.   Specifically told them I was a vegetarian and requested pepperoni be taken off the salad. Opened my takeout order to find pepperoni on the salad. Called to speak to the manager they left me on hold for 10 min and then hung up.   Don't waste your money. Northeast Ohio is full of great Italian food, Pizzaz will no longer have my business."}
{"text":"Always great food with equal service...a neighborhood favorite! The pizzazz salad is always a must. Can't go wrong with the any of the parmesans. Avoid the dinner crowd rush, the place is small and cozy"}
{"text":"Good pizza and pasta (asiago-stuffed gnocchi) and I love the salads (very simple: tons of cheese on some iceberg lettuce... but the dressing is really good--slightly sweet Italian). The seasoned bread (garlic flatbread?) is good too.  It's small, often crowded, and lacking in atmosphere, and I didn't care for the somewhat tasteless pesto (alfredo and tomato sauces were better). Parking can be tricky when there's a lot of traffic: it's a one lane shared entrance/exit. So minus 1 star, but I'll keep returning!  The red tomato sign shown in the photo here is from a different place; the actual sign is small with white letters on black, on a white \"house\" shaped building next to the convenience store. Across from Heinen's."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The char chicken salad with homemade dressing was fantastic and the deluxe pizza is out of this world. Our waitress was very friendly and pleasant as well. Overall great experience as we were in and out of there in about an hour and stuffed to the gills."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the world. Get the pepperoni and keep it simple. I also recommend the white pizzas and the tomato salad."}
{"text":"Asked husband to pick up a Petti's pizza, and he stopped here instead.  Not a fan of either the veggie or pepperoni pizza.  Not flavorful.  Asked for a small and a large, and was sent out with 2 large (paid for larges).  For me to not even eat the leftovers the next day for lunch says volumes about me- I never waste food, but it went in the trash."}
