{"text":"EverythIng was great - service,food, price, ambiance.  My wife had ahi tuna and I had rainbow trout.  Both were excellent."}
{"text":"So delicious! Everything from salad to entree to dessert was so yummy. Definitely would recommend the chicken pot pie and the cinnamon sugar donut!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here for dinner.  Atmosphere is relatively busy and there is available outdoor seating. The decor is average at best but forgettable for the most part.  Service was friendly and adequate.  I ordered a draft beer and my wife ordered a martini. She really liked her martini ($11).  My draft beer ($5) was served in a 16oz pint glass but only filled to about 12oz. I guess that's how they roll here but you can't help feeling shorted.  The menu is 'California Cuisine' and the prices are on the higher side (e.g., $14 hamburger, $20-30 entrees). My wife ordered a salad and and added chicken (a $4 surcharge) and I ordered the scallops.  Flavors were OK but nothing extraordinary.  Very small portion sizes.  Scallops were $24 and included 5 scallops, 1 strip of bacon, and maybe 10 miniature snap peas.  Overall, a very expensive yet forgettable meal.  If you're really hungry you may end up leaving that way unless you're just used to quasi-European sized portions.   We've been to several Fox restaurants and have started to notice a theme of expensive food, average flavors, small portion sizes."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food. Very friendly waitress. Great selection on menu. Price is average for this area.   Cons: host took a long time to get us seated even when we had a reservation and there were plenty of open tables. The music is so loud that we had to shout at each to be heard. For such an otherwise casual and friendly restaurant the music was too much.   We will most likely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.  I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.  The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.  The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.  Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).  The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.  I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking."}
{"text":"The evening started out great. Seated immediately, waitress knowledgeable and friendly. Bread and bacon butter was yummy, GH Mojitos were fresh & fruity, main course of chicken enchiladas, pork tenderloin and ravioli were all really good. Then it went downhill. No drink refills, no desert menu (except we went and got one from the hostess ourselves), barely cleared plates, all under the watchful eye of the Manager (?) tall worker hovering by the food prep area. Waitress returned when we asked for the bill to explain she got caught up with a table of 10 and couldn't be there to help us. So what. So our food is any cheaper than the other table, or we were just less important.  Left a note on the bill saying we felt ignored. For the price and number of other restaurants in the area, I can't imagine I will go back."}
{"text":"Horrible main courses.  Decent salads and desert.  I had the short rib which was very tough with NO flavor.  My wife ordered the trout which was recommended by the server and it was so bland and flavorless that she sent it back.  In its place, she ordered the salmon appetizer which was smoked salmon on very greasy potato pucks -awful!  The beet salad and wedge salad were pretty good, as we're the chocolate bar and the donut desserts.  However, I would not return to this place again."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour.  The bartenders are great. Remember out drinks any old fashioned strained outs amazing. I like the 1/2 chicken and the wedges salad"}
{"text":"I went to The Greene House last night on a first date because I have had great experiences with other Fox Restaurants in the past so I figured it was a safe choice. Was I ever disappointed! Right after we ordered, a small German Cockroach started crawling up the wall right next to our table. At that point I lost my apatite. The manager came over and apologized but his attitude was snotty and insincere. The trout was way too salty, I had to force myself to take a few bites. The chocolate cake was delicious, but not good enough to make up for the ill prepared dinner, uninvited guest or the manager with a poor attitude . This is my worst experience with a Fox Restaurant and I won't be going back to that location.   After last night's dinner, I have noticed a common theme with some of the Fox Restaurants. They over season many of their dishes!!! A few months ago I went to Zin Burger at the Biltmore and the zucchini fries were so piled high with seasoning that I could hardly see the actual \"fries\" let alone enjoy them. A few weeks ago I dinned at North and once again the zucca chips were horribly over seasoned!   I have always had a wonderful experience while dinning at True Food, Sauce and Culinary Dropout so I will probably stick to those next time I decide to go to a Fox Restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner.  Had not been there before.  The restaurant was nothing special as to decor or ambiance.  Quite noisy, in fact.  Sitting inside was the same as sitting outside as the entire wall was open.  Pretty casual place.  Menu was pretty limited but had some interesting items, similar to other Fox restaurants.  Definitely not a steakhouse.   I chose the scallops which was a good choice.  Served with carmelized cauliflower and bacon, they were very good.  I also had the wedge salad which was the best I have found.  My wife had the chicken ravioli which she enjoyed.  However, I though the quantity would really be insufficient for a lot of folks.  The service was adequate but the some of the seating was awkward in that the only view was of the cooks in the kitchen.  The restaurant is coupled with North and Bar North in a dining district at Kierland.  Great for hobnobbing, people watching and bar hopping."}
{"text":"If we lived here, we'd eat here once a week. Excellent food, excellent value, excellent service.  It's too bad the Fox group doesn't expand the Greene House concept outside of Scottsdale - this would work well in Austin and other cities."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for Valentines Day 2009.. Our first visit here. We have both dined at Bloom another of Fox Concepts places.. The menu for V-Day was a prix-fix... I had the Winter Squash Soup (basically was a butternut squash soup), perfectly seasoned with Chive Creme fraiche on top.. My wife enjoyed the warm Brie.. For our dinners she had the Pork Chops in merlot demi and I had the Beef tenderloin with a Green peppercorn demi.. Very good and cooked and seasoned to perfection..   The deserts is where I am negative.. I had the Boca Negra Cake which should be left of the menu.. It is a 2nd rate chocolate cake that my 4 year old nephew could do better.. It was heavy and dry and lacking in real flavor..  My wife enjoyed the Lemon Sorbet with Pistachio biscotti..   I had a glass of of the Madrigal petite Sirah.. For a $15.00 glass of wine, which was good, not outstanding, the price point should be lowered to $10.00 a glass or even $8 or $9.. $15 is too much!!  My first overall impression is the food is cooked to order. Taste is great.. For the first time in awhile, I didn't reach for the S & P... We will try it again, so we can sample other offerings on the real menu."}
{"text":"My wife and went in to The Greene House last Saturday night. We had a really nice dinner...service was good too. Our only complaint was that it was a bit loud, but we will go back again."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The food was decent, but it is overpriced for what you get. Also, our server was not very attentive at all. It was a busy night, but he hardly came to our table, and when he was there, it was obvious that he did not want to be there."}
{"text":"I went to the Greene House for the second time on a recent weekend getaway. Both times the food has been great with a wine list to match. The donut is a must have dessert. The only downfall would be the noise level, but it does seem to add something. It gives you the sense that a lot is going on and the joint is hoppin'."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my aunt. Went in around 11:30. Perfect timing. We had the Asian Chicken Salad and it was as expected, nothing exceptional but good. We also had the Turkey Flatbread Sandwich....awesome! We will definitely order that again. Oh, and our server Myron was excellent too."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Kierland Commons and have passed by this place often but never gone in due to its resemblance to my favorite joint next door- North. Today, I realised this place is the only restaurant in the area I have not tried so off I went and dragged two girlfriends along.  I reiterate, my favorite joint IS next door- North. This place is average. We had the tacos, rainbow trout, calamari and pineapple rum cake and for eachs of the dishes, I can say I have had better. The service however was good and the patio seating is welcoming. But may be a long while before I am back. There  is North next door.  ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch,food is fresh absolutely fabulous great wine selection service top notch"}
{"text":"this was my first item going to the green house. after a night of shopping and tired feet the choice was hard but felt this would take the hungriness away. we walked in caring our Starbucks cups which caught them off guard.  the service was good a little slow but good.  i pick a sandwich that they made into a salad for me. it was amazing but probable better as a sandwich but still great.  i will be going back because i was great!"}
{"text":"The Greene House is interesting. It's California fair is a good attempt but needs to be toned down, prices too. If you go, and get the over-priced Kobe Burgers, but don't expect it to be cooked to the temperature you request!"}
{"text":"Fantastic location in the middle of the Kierland Commons upscale shopping complex and very nice open patio seating.    While my lunch was good (had the mini Kobe burgers), I was surprised how limited the lunch menu was - only two different sandwiches and two salads.   Maybe it's just me, but I don't really want a full meal at lunch time.     The service was very good and I would go back."}
{"text":"I went there late a few weekends ago and sorry, I was not impressed at all.  Since it was one of the last places in the area I had not eaten at, maybe my expectations were a little high.  Maybe it was an off night.  I arrived around 9:30PM, a few people in the bar but the main area was mostly empty.  Service was so-so, food was so-so and will have to try it again and update my review, if it changes.  With the other choices right in the area, it will be hard to pick it over some of the other places in Keirland."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend for lunch. Crowded, but that's OK with me. A bit \"noisy\" as others have said, yes, but again, I didn't really mind that. Had the calamari but it came soggy and visibly oily. NOT good. I've had it there some time ago, and it was very nice. I have no idea what is going on. The fish tacos everybody raved about were dry and boring. No real flavor. My friend had the trout. Again, a disappointment. Dry and overcooked with no distinct flavor. I know. I tried it in disbelief, but it wasn't good. The open kitchen can be seen by guests and we also see what's going on there. At a lull in the action a bit later, I saw one of the chef's helpers at the line eating off the line with his bare hands. I'm not kidding. My friend saw it too. There was a handwritten sign just around the kitchen corner from where we were seated that said, \"PUSH TROUT\". I can see why now. Just a word of advice to the kitchen staff there.....we can HEAR everything you yell out to each other behind the seating area in the kitchen space. It wasn't amusing in the least. If you really want to spend this kind of money on a lunch, do yourself a big favor. Go to Fuego Bistro, Calistro, etc. and see how nice food can be. Enough said. A reluctant two stars at best. Never again."}
{"text":"I was in town for only 3 days and chose most of the restaurants we ate at during the trip. The Greene House was fantastic, and if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again, I will make a repeat visit. I started with the Beet salad and after the fresh pasta dish with some of the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had on the side, I sadly had no room left for dessert. There is a good variety of wines available for reasonable prices and the Fig & Ginger Mule cocktail was good enough for a second (to go along with the wine we were sharing)! The atmosphere is inviting and our server was gracious enough to laugh along with some of the jokes at our table."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Greene and Greene architecture. And I loved that the design of this restaurant was like being in a Greene and Greene bungalow. And the food was delicious. Creative enough without being just plain old weird. The atmosphere was nice even if a little loud. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a difference from our last visits. We're used to good food & service at Greene House but this time we had neither. Our meals took over 50 minutes to be brought to the table. Pork tenderloin  was undercooked & the pasta tasted \"off\". The restaurant was fairly busy and we heard complaints from nearby tables as well. Hopefully they get back on track."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here (lunch) and we will return again.  The service was great!  Our server helped my wife find a white wine to her liking and was very attentive to our needs.  We each had the Chicken Tortilla soup and loved it!  My wife really liked her Caesar Salad with the light, tasty dressing.  I ordered the Roasted Chicken Enchiladas.  You know how food tastes when you are really hungry?  Great, then it begins to get boring.  The enchiladas were stuffed with a lot of spinach that became the dominant ingredient on many bites.  The sauce wasn't very spicy (and lacking in volume) so the second half of the meal became pretty bland.  Of course, I ate every morsel but I will order something different next time....or ask to hold the spinach and load up on the sauce!"}
{"text":"Once again Sam Fox has done it again. Great location, great atmosphere and diverse menu. Service was attentive but not overbearing. I had the ribeye and it was good. A bit overdone which was disappointing. The salad that came with it was delicious. I would recommend The Greene House."}
{"text":"The must order item at the Greene House is the Calamari appetizer....it is amazing!!!  The calamari is still tender, and it is in a very light tempura style batter...but they also mix in some thinly sliced pieces of zucchini also in the same batter....it is like getting two awesome appetizers for the price of one!  Their menu is full of very clean, coastal flavors.  I had the fish tacos, and while they didn't quite measure up to my favorite one's at Loco Patron, they were pretty good.  We also had some hummus, which was served with a delicious warm flatbread.  The only negatives I found with the Greene House was the noise level inside and how close the adjoining tables were to us.  I don't know about you, but I don't like hearing about my neighbors trip to the doctor while I am eating!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I really want to give it an excellent five star review but........not quite.  One of the \"Fox\" restaurants.  The venue reminds me of a California type restaurant.  Mix use of indoor/outdoor concept.  It's fairly quiet so people don't have to yell to have a nice conversation.  The food is good.  The tuna tartar tacos are very tasty appetizers.  They are \"appetizer\" so they are quite small.  It came with the wakame salad which I loved.  Tuna tasted fresh :)  The best dish I had was the black cod (seasonal).  It was grilled to perfection and the fish was out of this world good.  However, I haven't found that on the menu after one visit.  I ordered Asian 'chicken' salad twice but both times there were no chicken in the salad.........  The service is not very good.  The waiter changed three times at one of the visits that I made there......  I think if one is in the area (Kierland Commons), it's not that bad of a place to have lunch or dinner but I'd have to say it's just ok for the high price paid for the food.  It may be better off trying the Zinc Bistro down the street or even North.  However, North is too loud for my taste. (You literally have to scream to a person next to you to have a conversation)  I'm hoping that service will get better so I can go back there with great enthusiasm!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late weeknight dinner with my parents and we were seated immediately - it was pretty quite because it was a Wednesday night. Our server was great - extremely attentive and so, so kind. We didn't feel rushed to leave even though we were one of the last groups there and that was definitely a plus!  My parents had the late-night summer 3-course special that included two glasses of wine, one appetizer, two entrees and two desserts for $50. I think it's available after 8:00pm during the summertime, but I'm not sure about weekends. It was an amazing deal and the food they ordered was great - the Arugula Salad, Atlantic Salmon, Braised Short Rib, Sorbet (peach) and the amazing Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin. The sorbet was a bit bland and we probably wouldn't have ordered it without it being included in the deal. I had the Pacific Cod Fish & Chips which was really delicious! The portion was pretty big, too. I substituted the cole slaw for the grilled asparagus and was really disappointed to get soggy, unseasoned asparagus. Otherwise, we all loved the Greene House!  Overall the food is great! I think it's well worth a visit, especially to make use of the summer special!"}
{"text":"4 stars overall, 3 stars food. The service was outstanding. Friendly and attentive, couldn't ask for more from a casual place. Menu was solid, with some great new American dishes, classic combos and good flavors. Nothing risky, well cooked and excellent presentation.  Space was well appointed and \"comfy\". Quiet enough to have conversation without raising your voice and if the weather is right, outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Reasonable portions -- though we should have come on a Sunday night when it's 50% off wine. WIne list is varied, not a lot of options but a wide breadth. Some good cocktails. But the food is fresh, (even half size salads), service is good."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place hundreds of times as I walk through Kierland Commons.  I had always avoided it, thinking that because of the name it might be vegetarian (not at all).  I finally went yesterday and had a great experience.  We did have to move our seat though because the misters were getting us wet, and 95 degrees is NOT hot enough to get wet during your meal.  The cocktails were good.  I really liked the lemon sipper.  We started with the white truffle fries which were tasty.  I had the flank steak with bleu cheese.  It was really good, but the kind of good that makes you feel full for about three hours.  All in all, the menu had great items, there were many other things that I could have ordered.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is up beat. My favorite dish is the meatloaf very tasty. The prices are reasonable considering its location. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I agree with Ellen J.  I too am a huge fan of Sam Fox restaurants, but am starting to wonder if they are going downhill. We are a huge fan of Blanco in Tucson; can't stand Blanco in Scottsdale. But we were talking about The Greene House. I have been here twice now. Had the same thing both times. The Mahi tacos. They were great the first time, good the second time. My husband and I actually wanted to split an order of fish and chips but, despite lengthy conversation with our server and the manager, it didn't work out for us to do this. Apparently it is a very cumbersome procedure here to split an order of fish and chips. They are only three pieces of fish so they would have had to have cut the third piece in half. Apparently there is no easy way to add a fourth piece of fish. Plus there is a $2 split fee. Did I mention the fish and chips are $15?! Our daughter is a vegetarian and, at our server's suggestion ordered some pasta with shrimp added. It was excellent, but imagine our horror at the $19 price tag when we got the bill! Our nine-year old granddaughter ordered chicken strips. They don't have a children's menu and, I am not sure in what dish these chicken strips are used, but they were dreadful! She only ate one of them (there were four). I ate one just to try it and can only say they were for the most part inedible. They were batter fried and the batter was not at all crisp. The chicken itself had no flavor. Regarding the \"decor.\" Vinyl covered chairs. I mean come on. The whole place needs to be given a makeover. It is not at all upscale and not what one expects in such a high end area as Kierland. Our lunch ended up costing $70 for three adults and one child, excluding tip. Admittedly this did include one glass of wine and one beer. Despite having brought our dissatisfaction with the chicken strips to the manager's attention, no offer was made to remove the cost from our bill.  I admit I am very picky when it comes to restaurants. Regardless, because there are so many other restaurant choices in the area, sadly we won't be back . ."}
{"text":"First time for dinner. Recommended by sister-in-law who has visited during lunch hours. Average at best. Had the pork tenderloin. Ordered it medium, came well done. Must have forgotten the horseradish in the potatoes because they were bland as can be. Mushroom and asparagus were forgettable.   Service was so so. Deemed themselves with great desserts."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch. Love the hummus app and the salmon salad  & Chinese chicken salad. Servers are very attentative and atmosphere is great inside and out!  This is my fav fox restaurant."}
{"text":"I will say the food was excellent. Was there on a Monday night with after a business meeting with workers. Was surprised at the slow service. I felt like the prices were high for the size of the meal, however the company was paying. Honestly though it wasn't bad for being right next to Westin keirland. Over all of your going to eat at keirland commons this was a great place."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time in the last 2 months i went here and unfortuantely it will probably be the last. I gave it 3 stars for the service and how well the management dealt with our disappointing meal. The first time i went i ordered the sea bass and my friend ordered the steak. My fish was so dry and tough and his meal was lukewarm. I heard the table near us complain about their sea bass as well so i knew it wasn't just mine. They brought out 2 new dishes for us which was so much better and they even took it off the bill which was very fair. Gave it another try last night and asked the waiter about the sea bass and he said everyone seemed to enjoy it so i ordered it again and my friend ordered the steak again. What are the chances of the same thing happening? My fish was like rubber and had a hard time even cutting it with a fork and his steak was almost cold. I lost my appetite after that and didnt even want them to replace it. They brough a new steak dish and it was hot this time. For how much they give you for the prices and the disappointing quality of the food i am not sure how people rave about this place. The other couple we were with enjoyed their meals and i have been there for lunch and the salad was good. I would say stay away from the sea bass if you choose to go."}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to have dinner here last night, and so glad we did.  This is definately 4 1/2 stars.  I can't wait to go back.   It was a beautiful night so we sat out on the patio and had incredible service and just a great feel from all of the staff.  The place is beautiful and comfortable.  Since I miss CA so much, I felt very much at home with the restaurant, food and wines.  I came away from the Green House very happy!  I wasn't very hungry so we snacked on appetizers and split a meal.  OMG...The tuna tartare tacos are just amazing.  You must try these.  BF had the BBQ Pork Tenderloin and loved it, I ate his mac n cheese.  Amazing.     So I guess this is a completely different menu than they had when they first opened, so if you tried this place before and hated it (as my BF did) give it another try.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough of the service and food in this restaurant. I came in for my birthday with my husband- and my waiter MADE my night. He refilled my water at least 5x (that never happens) and when I asked for donuts, he made sure to bring me his favorite dessert too. The chocolate bar. Not sure how they made the most delicate, bold, and delicious thing on earth... But they did. Thank you, sweet server, your attentiveness and kindness will not be forgotten!"}
{"text":"Food is bland! This is the 2nd time here... The worst among the fox concept restaurants. Never coming back. Go North instead!"}
{"text":"I have not had such a bad testing shrimp fried rice in a very long time. We ordered 3 dishes and they were either ok testing or bad testing. Fox has some good restaurats but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Patio seating is great especially when the weather is nice. The service was great too. Everyone was nice and attentive. Food came out rather quickly. However, salads were pretty small portions and the chicken was burnt on my kale salad. The salad itself was good but nothing I couldn't have made at home. We also ordered the salmon Salad. Salmon had no flavor to it.   Maybe the other types of food are better. I did see other plates that were not salads that looked delicious. This is the second time here and really was not Impressed by the food.   But service and staff were great."}
{"text":"Three of us had lunch there this week. Service was extremely slow and we were after the lunch rush. Bartender  (very nice and professional) was our server, but think the problem was food slow to come out of the kitchen. Two of us got fish and chips. Fries were cold and fish was just ok. Has been much better in the past. Got the calamari/veggies for app and it was awful. Greasy and all stuck together in a big pile. Many other choices in the shopping center and Scottsdale Quarter that are consistent and better for the price."}
{"text":"I'm giving only two stars for three reasons:  1. Took almost 15 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order, even though he walked by us twice; I assumed he wasn't our waiter. 2. We sat on the patio and the birds in the trees were screechingly raucous; I realize that the restaurant can do little about it but next time, ask for a table inside! And 3: the biggest reason for only two stars: ordered the meatloaf dinner that was supposed to come with roasted vegetable and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was delicious, but the vegetable were a big disappointment.  I love good, roasted veggies and was anticipating asparagus or broccoli or pepper, maybe some sugar snap peas.  Nope. Received barely cooked celery, carrots and onions.  None of which were even caramelized.  For the price, they should have offered something more \"exotic\" than THE cheapest veggie in the supermarket and at least, cook it to perfection."}
{"text":"Overall the food was decent but the service was mediocre. Our burgers were cooked well done when we asked for medium which happens I get it but the manager didn't even do a table touch which shows a lack of professionalism. I would still go back though... pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I have visited a couple times over many years.  I have had a full delightful & delicious dinner (with great wine selections) inside and fabulous cocktails, appetizers and dessert outside.  As a native Southern Californian, The Greene House drew me right in with the food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review...  Oh for God's sake when will I ever learn?!?! Another rubber stamped FRC joint to blow my cash... FRC = decent quality, high service, and low value.   Corn dogs at the fair are also overpriced, but ya know what? They're f'ing HOT. And f'ing FAST. And that dude with one tooth also asks me \"How are ya?\" eight goddamn times. And they serve $6 beers, too.   I give FRC credit for training their employees well, and at least I know they will not be closed in six months... and it's pretty inside, and there are cougars, and there was a clan of sherpa's rubbing my feet, and the tempura calamari is bitchin, and the Basil Gimlet was splendid (I had to have two, and the bartender graciously taught me how he made it), and the mac n cheese was dreamy at the bottom, but...    Oh yeah... my check. And the cold mac that took like 17 minutes (although the bottom was hot). I sensed that it wanted to be really, really good... It was never given a shot at the heat, man... Oh and did I mention the check... Mac and cheese with andouille sausage for $9? I'm ok with that but serve it HOT or the specialty sausage that your chef's education conceived tastes like a microwaved hot dog gone cold. ...like Ma used to make (which is very comforting, don't get me wrong, but cost only sixteen cents).   You CAN judge a restaurant by the mac n cheese... Sometimes I am just as happy at the fair for $68... try somewhere beside Greene House at Kierland first."}
{"text":"Dependable.  Always good food, a little pricey but acceptable.  Fair by the glass wine list.  Mostly a good lunch place while shopping at Kierland.  Service is asttentive but not overly so.  A go-to place for me."}
{"text":"I was looking for something special for dinner and looking all around this place looks very nice. Great call. I ordered the sea scallops with vegetables. Awesome. The scallop was perfect and the sauce very nice."}
{"text":"After 2 wonderful experiences at The Greene House I feel comfortable giving this restaurant 5 stars. Definitely my favorite restaurant at Kierland Commons.   This isn't one of those restaurants like Cheesecake Factory with everything and nothing on the menu, it is a smaller (35 items maybe?) menu but you will have no trouble finding something that sounds (and will later prove) to be divine. As far as appetizers, I've had the hummus, brie, smoked salmon bruschetta, spinach artichoke fondue. Couldn't pick a favorite, they were all delicious and highly recommended. As far as entrees I've tried the Kobe Burgers, Mahi Tacos and Atlantic Salmon. I have not gone wrong with anything I've ordered. It just kind of depends on your mood.   I don't know why, but I guess I saved the best food for last. This place could get 5 stars just for its White Truffle Parmesan and Truffle fries. Yeah, it's all it's cracked up to be--Ends wars and saves marriages good.   Service has pretty consistently been good. The first time our group of 4 went on a Sunday evening it was packed and without reservations we ended up at the bar. The host staff and bartenders were very accommodating and friendly even as we moved chairs to fit the four of us together. Our table was ready before could finished appetizers and we were having such a great time we didn't notice the wait. Also, I've sat inside and outside. They have heaters on the patio so I was never cold and if you are the type of person that finds some restaurants noisy you may want to opt for outside. They have a semi-open kitchen and it isn't a huge place, so inside can seem loud. Also, another thing I love about The Greene House is that although you do run into some of the See and Be Seen crowd, most of the people are pretty casual. Nice casual but not dressed to impressed. The crowd to me seems more like groups of friends getting together to catch up, rather than a pretentious vibe.   Did I forget to mention half price bottles of wine all day Sunday? Silly me. :)"}
{"text":"Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated \"the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level.\"  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.  Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.  Re: Another reviewer's issue with \"soggy fried calamari\" It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.  I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!"}
{"text":"So, not purposely, I ate in two FRC's on the same day. Modern steak for lunch and Greene House for dinner. I would say that time has treated the Green House well. It has really found its groove. I have dined here before and this was the best experience so far.   The menu is varied with options and price points. We were with a group of six and everyone was surprisingly happy with every dish. I had the beet salad and unlike others I have had, this one had about 6-8 small roasted beets chock full of flavor. The greens were plentiful!! A large plate full and the goat cheese and pistachios added nice texture. Not sure how they prepared the goat cheese...it was almost the consistency of a mascarpone, yummy! Others at the table LOVED the ahi tacos and tortilla soup.   I had scallops as my main course and they were cooked perfectly! A great sear on the outside yet tender inside. The julienned peas were really fresh and complimented the dish nicely. The only thing out of place was a crispy piece of bacon on top. The bacon seemed out of place and really unnecessary (albeit perfectly cooked...so much so a lot of breakfast joints should take notice.) Others loved the trout and homemade pasta. Everything seemed light, with a CA flair.   Oh, and the wine list is reasonable too. Only two bottles over $50 and many in the $20 range."}
{"text":"Terrific place!  The fish tacos were perfect as was the service.  The atmosphere was quiet enough to have a business conversation.  A bit hard to find as the place is tucked well into a shopping area.  I will be back."}
{"text":"always a good experience, good service and ambiance is quiet and calm.  perfect for business lunch or break from the madding crowds.  everything i've had here has been excellent."}
{"text":"A perfect table and a lovely evening spoiled by Kobe burgers that were ordered medium rare but delivered twice, well done.  The third person awkwardly ate alone. The manager and wait person were both appropriately apologetic removed the charge and gave us a complimentary desert. It was a very unsatisfactory evening and we won't be back. We were looking forward  to enjoying good food together not a free meal."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have seriously walked past this place a million times, but always chose North or another Kierland spot over it. I reminded him of this last week so we decided to stop in Thurs night for a quick bite. And woah, SO glad we did. We wanted to sit outside, but it was a little chilly... 'no problem' - says the hostess as she promptly flips the switch igniting the ceiling heaters. We were toasty in no time.   We started with a 10oz pour of a tasty and reasonably priced cab. Followed it up with the smoked salmon bruschetta - YUM, get this, trust me! And ended with a split portion of the chicken & pancetta ravoli (they split it for us, delivered it in heavy cast iron skillets so it was piping hot... and we both got 2 HUGE rav's - plenty of food). *Something to note if you order the ravoli - the sauce on the pasta is pretty heavy, rich/decedant, probably very caloric (& might I add... totally delicious).   The service was great too - quick, friendly & not pushy. The manager popped by for a breif check-in too. The final bill was right around $50 (b/c we shared the entree) & we used part of a FOX CONCEPTS gift card from Costco (these are awesome - $100 for $79.99).   Great experience, way to go Greene House!"}
{"text":"After having been to the Greene House many times now, I can say that you will not be disappointed in your experience here. This is one of our favorite go-to places."}
{"text":"To begin, our server Brent was phenomenal! The dedication to attending to customer needs was outstanding. This is our favorite place to come to any time of the day, and enjoy the food and good service. Compliments to the chef for awakening our taste palettes, and to the staff for making the dining experience welcoming and great!  See you next time when we visit from California."}
{"text":"Luv this place in summer when all bottles of wine 1/2 off (usually there 1x/wk with that special!).  We've sat @ tables, patio & bar, but usually bar, (faster, pers. att., swap new wine tips).   Luv the wine list Luv the truffle fries Yummy cheese plate Fun cooking classes @ summer Good patio for people watching :-)"}
{"text":"Went to The green house last night and haven't been there in awhile. We would definitely go back. The food was really good and sitting outside was lovely as well. The reason I decided to post is because the service was outstanding. We had a waiter named Anthony and our table of four was joking around and he joined right on in. Our friend was having a really bad day and he really helped to make it a great night. Even when one of our guy friends ordered a \"girly\" beer and we made fun of him for needing a straw with it, Anthony put a straw and flower on the beer when he brought it out. These small touches made a huge impact. Another thing we noticed was that the manager was not just standing in front like most, but rather was walking around making sure every table had what they need as well. She also was noticed. Good food and even better service makes this a place to check out for sure!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant meal I've had in a long time. Best kale salad ever. The chic ravioli n arugula was amazing. My diners also had great meals and raved about their meals!!!"}
{"text":"Going with a California feel, the restaurant looks like a beach house with huge wraparound patio. Evenings in Arizona get cool and dark quick, maybe some overhead heaters and patio lights/lanterns might make dining outside a bit more enjoyable.  The food is ok - throwing some ginger dressing and crispy wontons on shredded cabbage and lettuce doesn't constitute as making something \"Asian\" to me, but to each their own I suppose. Dumplings are crisp and meaty, no doughy filler which is always appreciated. Mussels are in a flavourful tomato sauce and truffle fries are a little overwhelming (yes, there is such thing as too much truffle oil)  Overall, decent place but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I love the Greene House, always our \"go to\" when we want great food and reasonable Scottsdale prices.  The ahi tacos are the best starter and the crispy chicken or any house made pasta is perfect."}
{"text":"Let me start by mentioning that I am a huge fan of Sam Fox restaurants. I usually find myself giving them four stars and the lone five star for Bloom that is now gone. The Greene House used to be one of my favorites and on our regular rotation, but we stopped going frequently when I found the menu items not worthy of the prices, particularly at dinner. And the past couple of times we went, I could barely find anything on the menu that even sounded appetizing to me.  Having said that, there is nothing inherently bad about The Greene House. They have a beautiful wine by the glass list, and some amazing cocktails. The pink and Greene martini was out of this world delish and served as my dessert too!    Hubby started with the tuna tartare tacos, which were presented in mod fashion.  He enjoyed them immensely.  He followed that up with the seared ahi tuna entree which, too, came artfully presented, with a huge mound of ahi.  I was surprised.  Not as tender and flavorful as he had hoped. (I have to keep reminding him that seared ahi is nothing like sashimi ahi, which is buttery and melts in your mouth.)  Satisfying but not blown away.    Usually, I like to pick an appetizer for my starter and an appetizer for my dinner, but I was hard-pressed to find even one this particular night so I opted to order the sea scallops with caramelized cauliflower, snap peas and bacon. What I received was five teeny-tiny sea scallops, lots of baby snap peas cut on the bias, charred cauliflower and one piece of bacon.  The scallops were tender and flavorful, the rest were useless garnish as far as I was concerned. We paid a lot of money for five scallops!  The host was genuine and welcoming when we arrived, seating us promptly in our desired area as we booked on Open Table and specified where we wanted to sit. Service was okay, nothing spectacular from our waiter.   On the up side, I love the Greene House patio, especially the side adjacent to the main dining room.  If you get there too early, you will get some serious sun as it sets in the evening sky, but it is one of my favorite patios in the area (along with the one at Bar North). It has great people watching and catches a nice breeze on hot desert nights. Saturday nights are especially happening when Kierland Commons has a band playing.  Full tummy (even if the food is just okay), nice walk around the center, and fun music makes for a great evening."}
{"text":"If this review came a few years a go when I first ate here, it would be a solid four stars, unfortunately things have changed at the Greene House. The high prices I understand being in keirland but the flavor and presentation of the food don't match up. Unattentive service and an exhibition kitchen where you can watch the cooks play with their hair and scratch their ears and some other things that we all know happens but just don't want to see. The cocktail list is very cool.  Three stars if salt was included during cooking process."}
{"text":"Took some clients here last night and really enjoyed the experience. Cool vibe, very good food, and excellent service.  Highly recommend the Trout or the Scallops.  The one downside was the fact that the wine is served room temperature. The restaurant is open-air and it was warm last night, so the wine was warm.   Aside from that, well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Horrible and the bartenders were SO rude!!! Bald head guy and blonde chick - won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable meal, warm, romatic setting and knolwedgeable wait staff. Comfortable fine casual dining done right. Good wine list and pretty reasonably priced selections. Definitley recommend."}
{"text":"I have always thought the Fox Restaurants were a step above the rest.  Well, the Greene House is a disappointment,... mixed at best.  When we arrived in the late afternoon the sun was so glaring off the cars parked out in front that I thought we might have to leave.  Oblivious to my discomfort, I finally asked the manager if they had a shade screen.  They did and he finally lowered the screen which helped a lot.  Should have been on top of that as I'm sure it happens every afternoon.  A side dish ordered by my husband was dropped on the floor, so it had to be made over and arrived after he had 1/2 finished his meal.  I expected the manager to come over, apologize, offer to compensate ( free dessert, whatever).  No, that didn't happen.  It was the creamed corn which was wonderful and worth the wait.   I ordered the pot pie which was dry and overly seasoned with Rosemary.  On the plus side, the salad - wedge - was huge and we were happy we split it, and it was great.  The parmesan truffle French fries were phenomenal.  The serving was very generous and I have no idea how they keep them so crispy and hot for so long, but they were wonderful.  Asking for the restroom, we found out that it was completely outside of the building.  Not appealing on a hot day.  So a mixed memory, but enough wrong that we probably won't be back.  Too bad because I may dream of those truffle French fries!"}
{"text":"excellent cuisine and ambience at the greene house - warm and friendly staff and managers - i will surely return to the greene house on my next visit to scottsdale - wish we had a greene house in southern california -"}
{"text":"On other Yelp reviews my wife and I tried this place. We r already contemplating our next visit. The Hummus appetizer is a must and is the best I've ever had. I got the fish and chips; which is unusual for me in a land locked state but again this dish doesn't disappoint. Perfect batter and portion size. The tartar sauce is not the traditional \"over mayoed\" stuff. They add a bit of malt vinegar so you get the traditional English flavor but is not overpowering.   My wife got the Mahi tacos and once she hit them with a squeeze of lime they brightened up and were a great dish. Also her side of green beans was incredible. The fresh beans were just slightly grilled with added toasted whole almonds.   I highly recommend this place and thank other 'Yelpers' for the recommendation."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Fox does it, but their restaurants never fail to impress. With so many choices for NYE dinner, we decided to try The Greene House for the first time. It was great!  The food was absolutely delicious -- fresh, flavorful, well presented.  The service was typical of Fox Concepts -- excellent.  Cost -- For under $70 we got an app, two entrees, two beers and a martini. Not bad!  I must say that the overall ambiance of The Greene House isn't quite as nice as Fox' other spots, but certainly still lovely. Perhaps they shouldn't set the bar so high. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and thought the food and the service was much better. This time it was a dismal experience on all fronts. It took 90 minutes to get a table of 7 fully served. Was really the worst experience I have had at any restaurant in a while. The food was okay and I've had better here in the past.  Sam, if you're listening, I think you've taken your eye off the fries brother. Stop opening so many places and focus on what made you great..Great experience, great food, great value. The Greene House needs to go back to the basics."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why the restaurant is categorized under \"salads\" and \"vegetarian.\"  I don't know that the menu has any more salad or vegetarian items than most other restaurants.  That aside, I really wanted to love The Greene House, as I have been a supporter of all the other Fox restaurants I've visited.  This one missed the mark for me.  There was nothing unique about the menu and the food was underwhelming.  On the bright side, I thought the decor was nice.    I was particularly excited about trying it out because the description boasted healthy fare.  I figured I couldn't go wrong with the kale salad.  Well, I could...and did!  The salad was swimming in dressing and had the equivalent of a block of cheese in it.  To make matters worse, the flavors in the salad just didn't go well together.  I generally like most salads but this one was bad.  After the bad salad, I threw my health kick to the winds and opted for dessert.  Surely, the restaurant could redeem itself with some sugary goodness.  Eh, not so much.  I tried the pineapple rum cake with vanilla gelato.  What a disappointment.  It tasted like a slightly warmed honeybun with whipped frosting on top.  That might sound appealing to some but I didn't care for it at all.  When I splurge on calories, I want to be blown away!  Sadly, this just wasn't it.  I didn't finish the salad or dessert.  The positive side of the visit:  the waitress was awesome.  She was very friendly and attentive.  She suggested a fruit-muddled mojito that was quite yummy.  I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, went there during a restaurant promotion, really enjoyed my pasta and everyone in my party liked their choices.  Nice al fresco dining also if you book ahead you can secure a spot on the terrace."}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Service was delightful.  Pomegranate margarita was divine!!  Awesome for a kid with food allergies!  Overall great"}
{"text":"Dear Green House  Ahhhhh Fox Concepts, how you woo me with your impeccably designed restaurants and local/delicious fair. I miss you, there is nothing quite like you here in puffed-up LA. You were so unpretentious but at the same time completely gourmet. The thought of your cheese plates, Braised Short Ribs, or Calamari make my loins ache with fiery longing. The memories we shared, my first sip of Orogeny, oh how time flies. Alas i must go but you shall always have a place in my heart... and stomach.   Sincerely Yours, Matthew  P.S. You lost a star for how you milked my wallet you fickle mistress. I love you though, you were worth every penny."}
{"text":"Added a fourth star to my prior review.  Had the half chicken dinner,  simple but delicious. Was exactly the meal I was looking for.  We also had the skirt steak.  Perfectly prepared,  and as I heard at the table,  \"I think this is one of the best skirt steaks I've ever had.\"  Well done.  The fifth star could be I  the future."}
{"text":"Great customer service.   Surprised my wife n friend s with a bottle of champagne.   It was easy and quick over the phone and the manager made sure it was perfect.   Thanks !!!!"}
{"text":"Ok atmosphere but I am always so happy to meet a friend for lunch in this convenient location and order their salad with chicken added.  I love that meal and it is VERY consistent and delicious with amazing goddess dressing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Green House on 8/22 based on Yelp reviews.  The meal started off great. We ordered the Calamari and the Brie.  We went on our server, Rachel's recommendation regarding the Brie.  It is served with \"sour cherries\", which we weren't sure would be good.  Rachel actually got us a sample of the sour cherries and we liked it and gave the Brie a try.  It was oddly presented by having small mounds of roasted whole garlic, whole sour cherries and whole nuts on the plate with the Brie.  It was served with toasted bread, which was excellent, but it was odd to put brie with a whole garlic clove, whole cherry and whole nut.  It would have been better served as spreads that could be put on top of the Brie.  On to dinner... on Rachel's recommendation I ordered the fresh pasta with tomatoes and shrimp.  It was excellent!!  My wife ordered the Fish Tacos, which Rachel told us was a lunch portion.   We thought it odd that the dinner menu offered lunch portions but she ordered it.  When it came, it was two rather small tortillas with a small portion of Mahi and a HUGE helping of Cole slaw on each tortilla.  It was way too much Cole slaw to the point where she couldn't even pick up the taco!!!   And when she finally tasted it, she couldn't even taste any fish, it was ALL Cole slaw!!!    We enjoyed a few drinks during dinner, but felt like we had to find Rachel a number of times.  We were going to get after dinner drinks, but when Rachel couldn't be found for 10+ minutes after offering us the dessert menu, we decided to leave.  We wanted a great evening and it started off that way, but it quickly spiraled down.  It was a shame."}
{"text":"We have eaten at The Greene House many times over the past year and have always had a great dining experience. Last Saturday, I made reservations and added that I would be bringing my baby in his stroller. When we arrived for our reservation the hostess could not have found us a better spot away in the corner and plenty of room for our stroller. I was so grateful! The food was amazing and we enjoyed the salmon appetizer and the donut for dessert. It was such a great experience out for the parents of a new baby. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here is great. Eat here a lot! Vibrant Bar Scene, Fit for Foodies, Great for Outdoor Dining, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Romantic, Special Occasion, Great for Lunch, Hot Spot"}
{"text":"It was OK, maybe a little above average. Don't get me wrong--I enjoyed it but I wouldn't go back. Caesar salad lacked any zip. Entree was more of the same."}
{"text":"Words can not describe the amazing sensation my mouth felt after taking a bite of the Mahi Tacos! By far my favorite Mahi tacos ever! I loved the pico de gallo, avocado, & salsa that brought out some brilliant flavors to the Mahi tacos. The tacos come with beans as a side, which were mouthwatering. I tasted some citrus and corn but I don't know what else it was seasoned with, but whatever it is keep up the good work. I'll return just based off of the side beans that came with my dish. My colleagues ordered the chicken pot pie and a salad, which they said were good. But no one else was gushing about their dish like I was so I think mine is a safe bet if you like Mahi tacos. Love that I work so close to this restaurant, because I definitely intend on returning! Plus superb customer service!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during Spring Training. Had the guacamole and chips with two excellent salads--very fresh ingredients, well-tossed and dressed along with polite wait staff."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed dinner during restaurant week here the other night. We made a reservation which I recommend doing. We got a great table outside and got to people watch. We had a 3 course meal for $40 and it was delish. I started with the Arugula Salad which was a really nice size. Then for my entree I had the Sea Scallops with Caramelized Cauliflower, Snap Peas & Bacon. The 2 long crispy strips of bacon were so good when cut up and in my mouth with the scallop. And I've never seen such little snap peas. They were an inch long. Didn't care for the cauliflower, but I still ate some of it. My friend got the fillet and it was really juicy and well prepared. OK, and lastly dessert was so good. If you love chocolate like I do, you must get the Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin. took at my pictures and you can see how awesome it is. The bottom is like a nestle crunch bar with mouse on top and then covered in a crispy chocolate shell. We also had the Pineapple Rum Cake, but it was nothing compared to the Bars of Sin. Our server told us we can get this dessert at Bloom too and we have 1 in Colorado."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place I ain't got their regular house salad great mixture of greens I like the dressing that was on it pretty refreshing salad worth the ten bucks wife had the salmon salad was okay but definitely not worth 26 bucks have the vanilla pudding it was okay their donuts was great our server was okay but nothing special more of a robot I would go back try something else on the price side for salads no"}
{"text":"Wowza, what a mac and cheese! I really enjoy everything about the Greene House.  Walking into the restaurant, the atmosphere reminds me of a California beachside restaurant you would see in Newport Beach. The fare is light and full of flavor. I always enjoy the salad options and the steak salad is no exception... it is truly flavorful. Just the salad would be too healthy for me though, I like to take a friend and split the mac and cheese with it also. Although I can never get a straight answer of all of the cheeses that comprise this little bowl of wonder, it doesn't matter, it is delicious. Topped with homemade croutons, the mac and cheese can't be missed. While you are visiting, make sure you look at their specialty drinks... the raspberry lemonade vodka drink is delicious on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Very good. Great wait staff.  Very nice setting.  Comfortable.  Berry mojito cocktail is  excellent. Food is fresh and well prepared. Salmon salad delicious.  Nice fish dishes.  Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a group dinner here during recent conference in Scottsdale. We had a range of wonderful appetizers (hummus plate, warm brie, smoked salmon), generous helpings of fresh salad fixings, exquisitely-prepared main dishes (sea scallops, rainbow trout, bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, atlantic salmon, filet of beef), and decadent desserts of Chocolate Bars of Sin and Caramel Apple Crostada Vanilla Bean Gelato. All served with grace and gusto by a gregarious, attentive waiter who ensured that our wine and food selections were pleasing and timely throughout our visit. Really fun experience & fabulous food in a casual yet elegant atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times so far, and the food is always fresh and tasty, service is good and the setting is perfect. We have been here for lunch every time, and I'm looking forward to trying their Sunday wine special and linger on for an afternoon! Great little spot with cute outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten at the Green House for lunch, I dont really see it as much of a dinner spot since Ocean Club and Zinc Bistro are so close. I have had the best service and they have the greatest Asian Chicken Salad. Great portion size yet very light and healthy. It is definately worth the trip :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the Greene House for the first time this past weekend. We had a reservation and sat right down. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant, and the waitor was upbeat and friendly. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, and really enjoyed it. I was really disappointed in my entree, though. I ordered the fish tacos, and they're probably the worst fish tacos I've ever had. Very bland... my husband ordered the meatloaf, and he liked it ok. Unfortunately, our experience wasn't good enough to bring us back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"11/17/2017 Met friends for lunch today and we all enjoyed the selection of items to choose from. The staff were very pleasant and tended well to our needs. There were 4 of us and we each had half of the turkey sandwich on a flat bread. We all agreed that it was very flavorful and fresh. Delicious!! I especially liked that they used Boston lettuce and the cherry tomatoes tasted like a tomato and not flavorless like so many. They must have a good produce purveyor. I will go back for sure.  Cudo's to the staff and chef!!! Highly recommend The Green House"}
{"text":"Two for lunch. Salmon salad (excellent), tempura calamari (excellent), roasted Brussels sprouts (could have be roasted a tad longer), horseradish potato gratin (very good but not a hint of \"horseradish\" ), spinach and cheese fondue (excellent).  Service by Christian very good. Crossings - New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, excellent - White Cosmo - just OK. Worth a return visit - (they were very busy but service was still very good). Food and drink prices were modest as well. Ambiance is \"open and airy\" large windows - lots of natural light."}
{"text":"We've been to several of the Fox restaurants and have enjoyed them.  My wife and I decided to try The Greene House even though it's a 45 minute drive from Ahwatukee.  My wife had the sea scallops.  They were nicely seasoned, tender, and cooked just right.  Even with the included sides, the portion seemed small and she was soon sharing my dish, the Roasted Chicken Enchiladas.    The enchiladas were excellent.  I'd probably go back to The Greene House just to order them again, despite there being several other entrees I'd like to try.  The portion was generous and the presentation was nice in an oval cast iron pan.  For dessert, we shared the Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin.  If you like chocolate, order this!  You won't be disappointed.  Definitely enough there to share.  Service was excellent, our waiter seemed knowledgable, friendly and was around just the right amount of time... not hovering too much.  Why only four stars?  Well, two reasons.  For our tastes, the restaurant has too many tables squeezed into the space and it's an extremely noisy environment when crowded.   We were seated at a row of two and four place tables that made us feel like we were dining with the strangers next door (we know all about their son's experience with college admissions now). When the waiters were speaking to the neighboring diners, they would stand between the tables resulting in the waiter's back-side staring us in the face like an uninvited guest at our table.  That and the overly noisy environment really took away from what should have been a five star experience.  These things probably aren't deal breakers for some people, but my wife said that even though she'd like to try more of the menu, she didn't think she'd be willing to make the trip again just because of the high noise levels."}
{"text":"These two stars are only for the service because our waitress was super nice and attentive, but the food definitely needs some help. I am very surprised that this place even has four stars because the pictures make the food look really good, but in reality it was one of the more disappointing places I've tried here in Arizona, especially for the price of the food on the menu.   First of all, the waitress introduced the restaurant as having dishes inspired from California. I would definitely say otherwise because we do not have dishes in CA that stink up your entire hands like the mussels that we were served. That appetizer dish was honestly not appetizing at all. The mussels just smelled so bad and trust me when I say I have had amazing mussel dishes and I ordered this one because I thought I was going to have that same flavor here in Arizona, but it was a big mistake. That tomato sauce needs some work and didn't even seep into the mussels long enough. The bits of sausage in the dish also made no sense and threw the flavor off. The only good thing was the ciabatta bread on top so that I can quickly use something to change the flavor in my mouth. For my main dish I ordered the seabass with broccoli and mashed potato since it was a recommendation from the waitress and also  a whopping $25. My guest ordered the pork tenderloin wrapped with bacon and vegetables. I paired my dish with a glass of white wine and my guest had a super watered down mojito. My wine wasn't too bad.   In terms of my main dish, it was honestly whatever. My broccoli on the side was cold when it arrived and the only thing keeping my dish warm was the small piece of fish lying on top of the potato. There was no sauce or anything for me to slide my fish into, just some mushy potato. The only reason why I expected more from this place is because of the reviews, location and the price of the food. If you're going to serve a piece of small fish for $25 please at least make it somewhat appetizing. I was super full after the meal but paying $90 for everything was just not worth it, not because of the price but the taste was just off for all the dishes. I'm not sure if I'm not supposed to order fish in Arizona, but since their menu had many fish dishes, I assumed everything would be fresh and yummy, but I guess I was wrong. I didn't even want to try my guest's dish because I was so disappointed at everything by the end.   Overall, I think they could improve their dishes if they change some things up and serve some better flavors, but for now I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"All the sexy people in Scottsdale go here...it was jam packed the night we went, and we were lucky enough to get a seat in the bar area.  Cheese plate featured artisanal cheeses (my fave) and the wine selection is outstanding.  Just a super cool place to be for a summer night out."}
{"text":"Good food. Not amazing, but definitely good! I get the iceberg wedge salad but I ask for it chopped up. Tastes good. I wouldn't recommend the turkey on grilled flatbread sandwich. It's nothing special. Instead go for the Kobe burger! Really good!   They give you bread and butter before your meal comes. It's delicious! The bread tastes like an asiago cheese bagel and the butter has bacon in it.   Great location. Restaurant has a patio which is super nice! If you're shopping at Kierland and want to eat somewhere this is a great choice."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Fox restaurant I have eaten at and it was ok. My fave is still Culinary Dropout, mmmm fried chicken... but I digress. The restaurant has a very calming atmosphere and on a Sunday afternoon was packed! I'm sure that had nothing to do with half price bottles of wine. The service was solid, the pricing about average as was the food. All we had were salads but the food being taken to other tables looked appetizing, especially the little tacos. I had the green salad and it tasted like Caesar salad but with some pistachios in it. I was hoping that because it had other \"green\" veggies in it the dish would have been hearty. I guess in the scheme of things the salad I had contained a few less calories than a Caesar and after half a bottle of wine in the middle of the day I shouldn't complain. My biggest complaint is that there is no restroom. There is a public restroom outside that is shared by, what I assume, the other 3 restaurants in the vicinity and everyone else that happened to be strolling by in that part of the mall. Having to wait so long to use the facilities was a turn off especially since public restrooms aren't maintained as well as ones in the place of business.  I would probably go back for half price wine bottles but try to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"So nice to dine outside. Good service. Good food. Be sure to try the hummus & flatbread appetizer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.  You will always receive great service and food.  Wine selection is also extensive.   When weather isn't hot they have a open concept and love that"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to the restaurant.  The food is always great and the dessert we had recently were amazing.  The location is great though we all know parking can be tricky there but I have never had a bad experience.  The last time I was there I got the chicken and prosciutto ravioli, the time prior to that it was the salmon with fingerling potatoes and it was simplistic but amazing.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have been to The Greene House twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times I enjoyed the experience.  First I went there for lunch with a friend. We sat out on the outdoor seating  to enjoy some of the perfect Arizona weather. Our waiter was very attentive and prompt. I ordered the twin kobe burgers. I thought they were done perfectly to my medium specifications and just the right amount of food. Now I am a \"picker\" when it comes to eating so two little burgers are plenty for me, but for others they may feel hungry afterwards.   The next time I went for dinner with my parents on a Saturday night. The restaurant was pretty packed and the wait about 25 minutes. The bartenders were very accommodating as were the hostesses. I guess you can give them your cell phone number and they will call you when your table is ready, so you can go around and shop if you want to. I think that is a nice touch.  Well, we were finally seated. The service was prompt and attentive. For my meal I had the crispy half chicken. I thought it was very good and the marscapone cream corn was an interesting side. Definitely different and out of the ordinary.   All and all two great meals for lunch and dinner. My dad barely complained when he was there, he loved his food, and that is saying a lot for an establishment. ha."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and ambience. Just nice enough for date night with candles and dim lighting  but casual enough to drop by anytime. Fantastic fresh food and drinks with great service. This has become one of our go to places in Kierland area."}
{"text":"I had Avocado taco and Pork Tenderloin.  Both dishes were well execute.  Not too heavy feeling afterward.  Great services to top it off."}
{"text":"Food was good and I like that you can actually hear and have a conversation here.  It wasn't really crowded at all (about half full)  when we wennt in around 8:30pm on a Saturday so it was a little baffling why the service was really slow."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of these negative reviews. I've been here 4 times and have enjoyed the food and service each time.  The trout is the best trout I've ever had! It is a big portion, is very fresh, and comes in a great light sauce. My husband got the pork tenderloin and enjoyed it. We ordered the salmon on potato pancake appetizer which was delicious."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and both times have been a good experience.  Food was very good and presented nicely.  We especially liked the salmon appetizers.  My wife swears by the trout.  Good drink menu with tasty cocktails and a wide variety of wine options.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  Apple crostada for dessert was a great finish.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, andin themood to try something new. The area is a nice out door shopping center, so it would be a fun activity for pleasant weather. The overall atmosphere was trendy and clean- pretty much what you would expect for the area. The staff was friendly and our waitress was decent. As for the menu selection, pretty standard American food, which is what I expected, so right on par so far. I ordered the Kobe Burger with the addition of mushrooms, fries for the side, and a beer. The burger was good. Not fantastic, just good. I couldn't really taste the 1000 island dressing, so it could have used just a touch more. The fries were, well, just fries. Nothing special there either. Again- none of it was bad- it was all tasty, but just very standard. My biggest complaint was that all their beer is in bottles, nothing on tap. That was a dissapointment, which is to say that I would eat there again if I was in the area hanging out with friends that wanted to go there, but if left to my own devices, I feel that for the money, there is better. This is by no means a bad place, just that there is good competition in the area."}
{"text":"The servers were all very well informed and helpful, the food was great. Nice variety given the size of the menu. The drinks (we had old 46) were incentive and fresh. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Kierland and wanted to check out the scene across the street. We settled on TGH after reading Yelp reviews. Our server was great. He wasn't shy about making recommendations of plates to enjoy and to avoid (saying that they were \"ok\" but didn't necessarily reflect the best creations on the menu.  I had the skirt steak and it was delicious. Will be hard not to order it when we go back again tonight."}
{"text":"i have been here many times, the food is always good tho the service can be spotty , wednesday my bf and i went before we had to head to the airport, and our server was absent minded at best and spacy at worst,  the food was very good ,tho the *bread available upon request*was very closed textured and rather heavy, great flavor but under bloomed,  not appetizing. for dinner we ordered the half chicken, and the braised short ribs stars service 1- food 3- total 4- would have been 5 had the server not been so absentminded"}
{"text":"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews.   This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.  When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.  Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying \"excuse me\" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.  I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.  After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.  Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.  We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout.   When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us.   When our server said she could take the fries back \"to keep them warm until our trout was ready\", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.  Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.  As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.   Spend your hard earned money somewhere else"}
{"text":"I love love love, did I mention LOVE fox concept restaurants?  Having said that, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by the menu and this location in general.  It was just mediocre.  nothing about it was bad and nothing about it was good.  If I were in the area again I might go in depending on my mood.  At this location, probably not, I would rather go to North.  Also Fox but DAMN GOOD.   Service was fair to average.  Same with food."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive waitstaff and wonderful vibe.  Everything I've had here is good and they care about the dining experience.  It's a favorite!"}
{"text":"Our first time here but not our last! Had delicious scallops entree with roasted cauliflower and snap peas. Gluten free option which was great. Husband had bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. Fresh food. Great service."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The food was really fresh and had tons of flavor. When busy it is a bit loud but did not keep us from having a great experience.   The tortilla soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"The Greene House was my second stop for Restaurant Week.  I figured it was a good casual place in a good location- you could do some shopping at Kierland and then have dinner and wine?  Sounds like a good day to me!  After wading through a sea of children, including a naked 4 year old girl, playing in the fountain (Seriously, this is not a public swimming destination, it's a mall...would you let your kid get naked and play in the fountain at Fashion Square?  Furthermore, this is North Scottsdale, don't you people have pools?) Thomas, Rickie and I arrived for dinner.   The first thing that struck me was that everyone at Greene House was SO friendly!  It was really nice.  I appreciate it when servers are excited about the food they serve...it makes me excited about it.  Things didn't start off very well, our bread was cold and Thomas had some dirt in his napkin.  Meh.  But things began to look up when our dishes started to arrive at the table.  I chose the smoked salmon crostini (essentially fancy bagel, lox, and cream cheese) and holy cow, it was HUGE!  I was expecting little 1-2 bite crostinis but these were pieces of toast- three of them!  Smoked salmon was layed on double thick!  I was most impressed by the scallops that I ordered for my entree- they were by far the cleanest and most well cooked scallops I've had in Arizona.  The quality wasn't there but they were at least prepared well and not at all gritty or sandy.  At the Greene House?  Who knew?  The sauce was a tad sweet but the snap pea shavings were the perfect compliment to the scallops texture wise.  Again, a huge portion.  For dessert I selected the strawberry rhubarb cobbler, which was oddly served cold, and found it too tart to eat.  Which was too bad because it was huge.    I'm giving Greene House 4 stars based off my RW experience because I think it serves the function that it is supposed to- it's a good place to grab lunch or a dinner when you are shopping.  The menu is diverse, the price points are varied, and the wine list is solid.  I don't think I would make it a point to come here specifically for dinner but I would plan on it if I was shopping in Kierland."}
{"text":"Braised short ribs were amazing.  The meat was extremely tender.  My biggest complaint would be that entrees were very small and extremely over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere pricing is good for the quality of food that you get. I ordered the French dip and it was on point."}
{"text":"This is really 3.5 stars...The Hubby and I went here last night (Tuesday) for dinner around 6:30. A friend recommended it and after checking out the menu online, I thought it looked pretty solid. We were seated right away. We ordered the Asian chopped salad to share and my hubby wanted to try the chicken tortilla soup. We loved the salad. It was awesome. But he thought the soup was just eh...it was aiight, but he wasn't wild about it...for our main entrees I had the braised beef short rib which came with zucchini and cheese grits. Hubby had the fresh pasta with shrimp. I loved how tender my short rib was although I'm not sure about the juices the grits were sitting in...I think the cheesiness didn't mesh well with the flavor of the short rib juices and it tasted a lil weird..I was still able to enjoy everything though, I just didn't eat a ton of the grits. My hubby thought the pasta was bland, So he used salt and pepper. Pasta looked nice and fresh though! I wouldn't say it had a sauce on the pasta, because it was so thin. To him, that was kinda weird and he would have rather had more of a tossed in olive oil type pasta. Overall the salad was amazing and my dish was mostly good. They also have fresh lemonade that was super good :)"}
{"text":"For some reason I thought this was a vegetarian place until a co worker convinced me otherwise.  I have been here twice now.  The food is so good.  I had the Half Crispy Chicken(not actually a half a chicken but so good) and the Mahi Tacos.  Both are really good. I would order them again.  The Doughnut is so good as well.  Don't miss out on that. I repeat, get the doughnut!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service is ok. We sat for 15 minutes without a server, and apparently.no one told him we were his table. It's understandable since he was working in the patio and we were in the bar area. Overall, it was pretty good. I've been here multiple times and the food never disappoints. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful, casual atmosphere with nice outdoor seating.  The complimentary bread and spread are different and good. My Greene House Salad was okay. I asked for the parmesan on the side and did not get the parmesan at all. My son's Fish and chips were good. Rainbow trout was prepared well and very good. The Chocolate Mocha Bars and ice cream for dessert were fantastic and I would definitely get that again. Overall, a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Have lunch here every Thursday, eat at the bar.  Great service and I think the food in great.  I think I have had most everything on the menu at sometime, with the exception of the desserts which look great.  My favorite thing is the tortilla soup, but the main courses are also great.  Jamie makes a fantastic martini."}
{"text":"The Greene House is a very solid restaurant.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the meal.  We both liked the decor and ambiance, and eating outside in the Winter was great, as we're from Chicago, though the heaters were a bit too intense at times (they cycled on and off fairly frequently).  The service was excellent; our server was very friendly and attentive and offered advice when I had trouble deciding between 3 entrees.  The food was very good, overall.  The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was very tasty, though nothing truly unique.  My scallops were good, though I felt like the bacon strips were gratuitous and made the dish feel cheaper than it actually was.  Her turkey sandwich with pesto on their grilled pita bread was the real standout: interesting and flavorful, with just the right amount of kick.  I'm rarely jealous of what others order at restaurants, but in this case I certainly was.  If and when I ever return to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I certainly wouldn't mind returning to the Greene House."}
{"text":"Horrible hosts! Gave a 40 minute wait and were rude about it .. on a Wednesday night. This isn't miami or La.. give me a break. Especially when I saw open tables."}
{"text":"We decided to sit at the bar tonight! Service was prompt and drinks arrived fast. I had a classy old fashioned which I was very happy with! My girlfriend had a fancy mule. The calamari is unreal, some veges mixed in between gave it extra flavor. I wasn't over impressed however with my skirt steak, a small piece with a bit of mixed salad to accompany. My photo is after two bites. I was hoping for a better size serving. All in all it's a cool spot and very busy!"}
{"text":"Disappointing lunch. Ordered the chicken club sandwich.  Not your normal club. The grilled chicken breast was dry. Worst part was finding a strand of hair in the sandwich halfway through. The rest of the family thought the food was ok. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"I would have more inclined to give Green House a 5 star rating had a couple of poor Customer Service issues not occurred, because the food was excellent:  First we ordered drinks, there were 4 of us but only 3 drinks were ordered.  No kidding, it took a solid 15 minutes to get them and I saw them sitting on the bar waiting to be picked up.  (it was Sunday and NOT busy)  We also ordered a bottle of wine  and the wine was served 1 minute after the drinks were served.    Also, I think there is a bit of an art to how many times a server should come over to the table and ask, \"How are things\"?.  0 is too little and 5 times is too much.  Any disagreements?  These 2 CS issues made me not want to go back.  I think its a shame, as I said, the food was excellent and hope that the owner or manager reads this."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there today! Good ambience! Great service!  Tasted the chicken tortilla soup (just awesome), bacon wrapped pork tenderloin (made a bit more spicy for my Father in law) and fresh pasta with chicken (yumm)! Ended the meal with their panna cotta which was just heavenly!  Definitely coming back to try out more options in this place!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to FoxRC's for over a decade.  What a metamorphosis of a brand! Many of our Yelps have been about their various restaurants and our experiences as diners with special requests. This includes their SoCal concepts as well.  Saturday late afternoon we called ahead and spoke with Tony and told him about our special/healthy requests. No question their Chefs would have to do something out of their box, yet simple. Tony was over the top accommodating and we came in.   Danielle was our waitperson and she was a Pro through and through and one who has been with the company for the better part of 12 years. That and full of good energy knowing she is plotting her runway towards a career in medicine..  My greatest joy was that they could accommodate my wife's healthy request and that she was major league happy with what was served.  What a win!  Tony was all over the place including cleaning the windows.  Seriously!  Fox has a way to empower their people to excel and one never gets the feeling that these people are only present as \"quit and stay\" staffers.  Amazing culture without any doubt!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner, and fell in love with this place!  The salmon entree was perfection, wide wine selection and terrific service.  Well worth it and I'll be back!!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Mussel appetizer:  It was good but a little bit salty. It could've been better if it was warmer. The giant size garlic bread that served together was also very good.   Sea Bass:  It was not Chilean Sea Bass but The fish was soft and tasty. Especially the crust outside and juicy inside was extraordinarily good. And the spinach and mashed potato was cooked perfect also.   Shrimp Pasta:  We ordered with spaghetti noodle and it was little too thick but it was cooked perfect as we want.   Special:  The server (I didn't get his name) was very very kind and knowledgeable to answer our questions."}
{"text":"Outdoor dining is very nice. The crispy chicken, meatloaf and trout are very very delicious. My friends were able to split the chicken and meatloaf dishes without an extra charge for sharing. And try the homemade donut with cinnamon dessert is light and flavorful. For those of you who are people watchers, it's a great location particularly the side closest to Papyrus."}
{"text":"This was the restaurant my coworker chose for her birthday lunch. A few of us have been here before but it was years ago. It was not very busy when we first arrived around 11:30ish but it definitely picked up during our time there.   To start, we shared the the Crab & Avocado dip since it was a seasonal item. It was plated nicely but we all thought it was odd to come in a jar as it was not the easiest to get to the guacamole at the bottom. Once the spoon is in the jar, stuff would fall out so it was a bit of a struggle - not that eating is really that much of a struggle but I'm being a diva right now. We enjoyed it - refreshing for the hot weather but nothing special.  We all enjoyed our dishes. I got the Scallops entree. The others got the Shrimp Pasta, Bacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin, and a Kale Salad.  The Scallops were cooked well with charred cauliflower, snap peas and chunks of bacon bits. Maybe it's just me but I think they were a little heavy handed with the bacon bits. I would order this again. My coworkers enjoyed their meals as well with the Kale Salad with the least loved. Who loves Kale Salads anyway?  Finished our meal with the Chocolate Mocha Bars and the Cinnamon Sugar Donut. The vanilla custard & berries that came with the donut was the perfect pairing. Think of it as a deconstructed filled donut. I didn't get the mocha taste for the Chocolate Mocha Bars - more hazelnut than mocha. It was a very rich dessert so I would share."}
{"text":"This is a generous slant on 3.5 stars as this is probably the best experience food wise that I've had at a Fox restaurant. I really, really do want to like them as the atmosphere and service are always second to none but the food usually falls short especially for the prices. The restaurant was quite full, as was Keirland-anybody hear about the recession? No? Good, keep spending and eating at restaurants!!  Greene House gets major props for the Mission/Arts & Crafts decor (my favorite as it embodies timeless warmth) and a very friendly server!! I ordered the pork tenderloin with penne (mac-n-cheese) and broccoli. The pork was masterfully cooked, the mac-n-cheese was okay and the broccoli was straight out of the bag I don't think it was cooked at all. The house BBQ sauce struck me as almost bitter and not very good, but my buddy just loved it. You know what they say about opinions..........  Kobe sliders were okay I thought, good fries, and my other two friends had the sweet potato cannelloni and veggie panini which I did not taste but they seemed to enjoy.  I'd probably go back to Greene House, patrons should check out the $100 gift card pack for Fox Restaurants at Costco for $80 to maximize your value."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite Fox Concept restaurant so far.... (Ive tried most).  I went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too packed- no waiting.  Server was very attentive, however may have been new because he was not very knowledgable when I asked about menu specifics.  Nearly everything we had was great!  Spinach and artichoke fondue was a yummier, classier version of the (usually) boring appetizer.  I love when places serve it with grilled flatbread rather than chips!  I ordered the chicken and pruiscuitto ravoli and it was very good!  I was very skeptical of the donut dessert before trying because I did not a want something greasy like a churro or funnel cake.  Fortunetly my assumptions were wrong!  It is truly amazing and unique!  The only disapointment was the side of Mac n' Cheese.  I love trying different macs at restaurants so I made my boyfriend order it for his side.  It was one of the most disapointing Macs I've ever had.  It tasted just like velvetta shells n' cheese.  Not what I expected at a Fox restaurant.  If it wasn't for the Mac I'd give this place 5 stars!  I will definetly be returning to The Greene House in the future"}
{"text":"Jess Rocks!!!! My husband and I dine at the Greene House an average of 3x per week.  Why?? Is it the food? Well, the food is great for sure. Every item we order is a fantastic combination of ingredients. Is it the location? The location is certainly convenient for us. But it is none of these.  It is 100% the bartender team. We exclusively sit at the bar and ALWAYS receive 5 star service and made to feel completely welcome. Jess and Jaime are simply the best in town!!!!"}
{"text":"The green house restaurant in Scottsdale has greaattt food.  We visited Scottsdale for New Year's Eve and during the day we were shopping at the keirland commons, we had put down our name at another restaurant which had over one hour wait, as we were walking we walked by The green house, we walked in and luck it didn't have any wait, I was hesitant that it might not be as good cause there isn't any wait but, my husband said let's try it and aren't we glad we tried it.  Food is phenomenal backed by excellent service.  We are sooooo glad we walked into this.  Their Smoked salmon, tortilla soup, pot pie and roasted chicken is just amazing."}
{"text":"Dinner for two on a weekend came to $110 with 1 drink and no dessert. The meal just wasn't quite right. The bacon scallops had a single slice of bacon across the top. Weren't they supposed to wrap the scallops in bacon? Strange. The scallops themselves were tender and fresh. The fillet medallions which I asked for medium was more like a medium rare and the sauce that went with it didn't have enough flavor. The steak was pretty good but nothing amazing. It was the only place in the Commons that night that didn't have a long wait which is telling. Wait service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great salmon dinner and wedge salad  Good coffee  Good service and hospitality Did not appreciate server telling us the 20% tip amount and that we could take it off our gift card too Very pushy"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a late lunch at the The Greene House last week.  The waitress suggested a salmon kale salad and it did not disappoint.  This is not just your regular old salad spot.  It's super fresh and delicious.  I can not say enough about the service!  It deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"When we went before, we must have been there and it was a bad restaurant day!  We have been back many times since and love going there, especially for lunch, eating outside and do lots of people watching.  Food definitely has improved!  We have had so many things on the menu, salmon, salads, burgers, scallops.  All excellent.  We are definitely fans!  On Sundays, if you go, they have a bottle of wine, I believe is half off. We go and we feel like we, too, are tourists!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Nothing special - shrimp pasta, Asian chopped salad and gratin potatoes.  Service was good.  This was our second try so will cross it off the list for next time."}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary and couldn't have been happier with the food, service, or ambiance! The grilled filet medallions over fried rice is quite possibly the best dish we've ever experienced in the valley. Weeks later we're still raving about it! Besides the filet, we ordered the scallops that come with carmelized cauliflower and snap peas with bacon which was no disappointment either. Very rarely do we buy dessert at the restaurant since we have our favorite stand alone dessert spots, but after seeing \"Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin\" on the menu, we had to check it out. Holy Moley! It was so rich, so perfectly chocolate-y, with hazelnut wafers topped with chocolate mouse and dipped in a chocolate shell, vanilla bean gelato and fresh raspberries, all lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce. Amazing! I can't wait to go back!   *** The only downside to this place is that patio dining seems to be really noisy. We ate inside but it's an open air concept so we could hear all the racket outside. Sure, it's a busy area but it's the birds that make the tree outside their home that are loudest. Weird, I know, but they were so loud, I remember thinking how glad I was that we ate inside."}
{"text":"Great good with a cozy atmosphere.  I work at Scottsdale Quarter so I have a plethora of restaurants to visit at lunch. This is by far my favorite. It is a bit pricey (it IS in Scottsdale after all) but this is quality eats with good service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Greene House, and I was really impressed.  The service was outstanding!  The bartender went so far as to offer to make me a Dirty Martini with basil (if you haven't tried this yet, you should...my boyfriend and I make them at home and...YUM!) when I asked about the vodka Gimlet with basil.  In addition, when I stuck up my nose at the caramel topping for the chocolate dessert, he quickly said that he could make a substitution.  And he said I was beautiful, which, of course, always catches my attention!  The salmon creme fraiche bruschetta was OUTSTANDING and actually portioned larger than I expected!  And my main meal (scallops) was outstanding as well!  My only complaint is that I only received two (2) scallops.  Really?  I paid $19.00 for two scallops!?  Lastly, the bar is beautiful...love the FLW influence...and the place was hopping on a Saturday night, which is a very good sign!"}
{"text":"Some of the best scallops I have had. Who would have thought in AZ of all places. I love the concentration on  use of local veggies, and attention to adding so many colors to incorporating dishes with quality ingredients. The scallops I had here were Devine and creamy on a bed of roasted cauliflower and an array of green veggies.  The green started salad was large and hearty. The dressing was the best part."}
{"text":"Had the tortilla soup for a starter- awesome! Wife had an Asian Salad and enjoyed it. I had the skirt steak on top of some veggies. Would def get it again.  For dessert had the rum cake, it was good but not warm all the way through. They needed to heat it longer. Overall a nice restaurant and we enjoyed it. We like the Kierland area and walking around before or after dinner."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, makes me feel like I'm in California but the food was just okay. Good but not amazing. The only thing I recommend is the Tuna Tartare Tacos. I could just order that!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Servings little smaller than what I am used to but definitely enough for most people. The Kobe burger, pot stickers, and ahi tacos were excellent. Waitress was very friendly  Less a fan of the scottsdale location and crowd. Reservations are a good idea because it is busy on a Saturday. For happy hour, probably good deal with 1/2 price bottles of wine"}
{"text":"I've visited this location three times -- once for lunch, another for Happy Hour, and then for dinner. All three experiences were wonderful.  For lunch, the ambiance is bright and cheery, the perfect midday stop to enjoy watching others shop and appreciate the company you're surrounded by. I had the mixed green salad with salmon, my friend had the same. We each had a glass of wine. The service was great, the salads were fresh, and the salmon was prepared medium to perfection.  Its easy to be lazy with a salad and salmon. But Greene house fresh flavors kept me full and happy for hours.  Happy Hour we split the tuna tacos, the potstickers and yes of course the warm brie. There was plenty of food for the three of us and the cost was very reasonable. I wish I could come back for Happy hour more often!  As expected, the warm brie was absolutely to die for !   I don't recall what I ordered for dinner. I only remember we dined outside and it was just a lovely romantic setting.  I wish I had liked the guy, I would have swooned a bit more.   I can't wait to go back. Fox Restaurants has yet to fail in my opinion. The hassle of Kierland parking is actually worth it for this one!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the food wasn't as impressive as I had hoped.  I had the Lobster Risotto and it was decent, but nothing really special I felt.  The flavors were a bit off and I didn't want to ask my dining companion about her meal fearing she was having a similar experience (and since I had chosen the place).  For the food, I'd say three stars.  Service was good though, and the dessert I had was great (Scharfenberger mousse).    Ambience was a bit loud, and not super cozy, but I may be a bit of a food snob since I'm so spoiled by some amazing food in the Bay Area so I just can't give this more than four stars."}
{"text":"My wife, myself, and some friends all decided to go here. My wifes friends were treating due to all the help we did with their wedding. Its a very nice place, in a very nice area. Everyone was friendly and the service was good up to a point...  I seemed to get the short end of the stick at dinner. I had the scallops and greanbean thing. My scallops where all burnt on one side, and even the greenbeans were burnt. I joked about it with the waitress, who did apologize, and wanted to replace it but after waiting so long I was pretty hungry from waiting so long.... Wheres Gordon Ramsey when you need him checking the food? Everyone elses dinner in our party appeared to be good from what they said.  There was some shadiness when we went to pay the bill. Our friends had a gift card, and added a 100$ cash on top. She got the gift card back, with change on the gift card. To me, this is a big no-no. Gift card gets used first, and then give us cash back please! Now because of the money being put on the card, she didnt have enough for a proper tip. After she dropped the card off, she pretty much disappeared so we didnt have a chance to ask about it. Oh well, she got a less of a tip because of it.  Afterwards it was nice to walk around the shops and window browse."}
{"text":"All I can say is that The Greene House served it's purpose, but it's nothing to write home about.   It's not very distinguishable from Zinc Bistro since its in the same area.    We started off the meal with their soggy fried calamari and artisan cheeses that were just average.  My boyfriend enjoyed his trout and I liked my pork tenderloin and sauces, but the creamy cornbread (polenta) that accompanied the entree had a weird texture.   Good thing we ordered fingerlings! My friends had the Mahi tacos, but the limes were dry and another had the Kobe burgers with Mac and Cheese.    The service was good, always refilling the drinks and available.   As a whole the food and restaurant were not memorable and I probably would not ever go there again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I met some good friends at The Greene House last night for dinner at 6:30 p.m.  After reading the recent reviews on Yelp, I was a bit skeptical to try this place to try this place.  So glad we did!   I could not have been more pleased!     We were seated very quickly inside at a table for four at the window.  This was perfect as we love to people watch.  Kierland Commons is a great place to do just that!  Our table started with the hummus app. which was great!  Everyone had something different for their entree.  Our table had the tuna tacos, the fillet, the shrimp pasta as well as the bacon wrapped tenderloin.  We also shared a Mac & Cheese for the table. Not one complaint!  Everyone was very happy.  The stir fry veggies with my fillet were delish!  We wrapped up our dinner with the donut dessert (easy to share for four after a big meal).    The service was also wonderful and attentive.  Our server, Renee, never let our wine glasses get empty and we never wanted for anything.   She was fantastic and very nice!    Bottom line is you have to judge places for yourself.  Last night was good company, good atmosphere, good food and good service.  We could not have been happier!  After dinner went next door to North to have a night cap and watch the end of the basketball game.  Alex, the bartender at North, was terrific fun and made a wonderful martini for me based on my preferences!  He seemed to enjoy whipping it up as much as I enjoyed drinking it!    Thumbs up to Fox Restaurant Concepts!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service at this restaurant!  I had the trout and it was excellent.  My husband had the crispy chicken.  He typically never orders chicken out but said it was the best chicken he has ever had.  We started with the Greene House salad and it was great.  The vegetables were crispy and fresh.  The way they should always be but rarely are!  We split the brussel sprouts and they were perfectly done.  Jude was our server and he was extremely attentive.  He offered to bring me a sample of a wine before I ordered it to try it.  They are lucky to have him!  We look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great vibe. I always enjoy this place. Love the Kierland location."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to try this place on a beautiful spring evening when the walls were open tom the outside. Beautiful ambience. The fish taco plate was perfectly sized, satisfying without being overwhelming.  We also very much enjoyed the fondue appetizer.  Would definitely return!  One suggestion, some Arizona wines on the menu would be nice. given the proximity to the Westin, it would be a great opportunity to showcase some fellow local businesses."}
{"text":"We have been customers of The Greenhouse for years. It was our favorite restaurant but sadly I can't say anything positive about it. We have noticed that the prices continue to rise and the quality is going down. On Friday I had the fish and chips there was so much grease the fish was not crispy and the fries were soaked with grease. I mentioned it to the waitress but she didn't even respond. My wife had the salmon salad and the greens were not fresh and wet wilted. We also noticed a lot of new people. A real shame as it used to be great. I am basing this on our last 3 visits. It has not lived up to expectations.   I have spoken with them I have returned and the problem has been taken care of. This is a great Reasturant"}
{"text":"I think I am coming to realize as I write my reviews that aren't impressive have something in common: Fox Restaurants.   I must not be a fan of their taste but again, I like the style. I love this patio, too. I came here with my mom for wine and salad. I don't remember what salad I had but it was leafy greens with a vinegarette of some sort. I will probably come back just because I enjoy the patio so much....but probably only if theres a super long wait for Zinc. I would have Zinc over this any day"}
{"text":"I have to say this is a very inconsistent place. I have been here and it was really good and the time time not good at all.  The brick ckicken is flavorless and tastes very chickeny. It is moist though.  The steak is the only time I have ever like steak at a restaurant, But it has been bad too.  The short ribs are good but not amazing   the best thing I ever had there was a seasonal walnut ice cream it doesnt sound that great but it is truley amazing  I do like this place but for the price and inconsistensy not so good.   Its a gamble"}
{"text":"Well Zin is too crowded, so why not another FoxRC restaurant and it was a nice surprise; good going Trish!  Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Club Kobe Burgers make comfort food a necessity for flu victims like us ;). Great service, location and funkadelic music...unique all the way, even with the double clear coffee cups.  Hint:  ask for extra bacon strips so you will be happily greeted by big nosed doggies :)"}
{"text":"The Greene House never fails to exceed my standards of excellent food and service -- (and trust me, my food standards are quite high) and this dining experience was absolutely enjoyable and without exception a wonderful dining experience. Kim, our waitress, was exceptional on service, knowledgeable, and extremely attentive - not only to our table/needs - but also to the other tables she was serving around us (oh yes, I was definitely watching and observing her flawless service to each and every customer she spoke with). She made us feel like we were part of the Greene House family (and if management is reading this, Kim deserves a raise, bonus, pat on the back, free movie tickets, etc). And I'm not sure what it is about the Greene House, but everyone -- and I mean everyone that works here has a smile on their faces! :) Now THAT'S what I like to see -- happy smiling people. So whatever you're doing (management), whether you're spiking their drinks with happy juice or just being plain awesome, it's working! Happy, smiling employees make for happy smiling customers that will be coming back for another wonderful dining experience... Yes, that's me saying \"I'll be back\" (like in the movie Terminator, lol). So, in short -- Thank You!!! :)"}
{"text":"Other than the noise  we really like coming back here.  Food is always consistently good.  Only one so so meal, that was the flank steak.  Great mall to walk around after dinner."}
{"text":"I really didn't really look forward to this restaurant because I was skeptical but I really enjoyed my chicken pot pie. The servings were perfect and all of my friends enjoyed their food.   I'm really happy with their work toward creating a greener environment. The price was fair and I really can't explain how good my chicken pot pie was."}
{"text":"Browsing at Kierland Commons and wanting a wine break, we walked into The Green House.  The walls are open for the cool desert night time air and the decor is a subdued modern with candle lights.  Our bartender swiftly greeted us and served cool drinks. My daughter had the fig mule which is a cool twist.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Reliably good food at reasonable prices - for the Scottsdale area.  In other towns it would be the five-star out-standing restaurant.  The food is California-American. My salmon dinner was nicely prepared and presented; service was excellent for a busy Saturday evening."}
{"text":"We made a reservation.  I was in town for business.  The brie appetizer was delicious with nuts, dried fruit and fresh bread.  The potstickers, since I'm Chinese, were not as I expected. They were tiny and a bit wet,salty and brothy for my taste. I'm accustomed to a larger dumpling that is crispy on the exterior and more crunch in texture.   I ordered the halibut and it was perfection. Perfectly moist, and fresh. Portions are a proper sizing for the health conscious.  And last but definitely not least is the chocolate candy bars for dessert. A crunchy hazelnut base, and crisp delicate crackly chocolate exterior enveloped a cookie/cake center that was light and rich at the same time. The ice cream (vanilla bean) was the perfect pairing.  I think the dessert was my favorite item this evening.  The staff, as some have mentioned, are learning.  Give positive feedback to your servers so they can learn.  They communicated well, but perhaps some need to listen to the needs of customers a bit more and smile??? Hopefully they are receptive and apologetic.   I recommend The Greene House.    When I'm in Phoenix I'll return."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant. The crispy half chicken delicious, and their kale salad is my personal staple... and I always try to find an excuse to order the chocolate bars for dessert. We always choose the Greene House when we are celebrating a birthday or when people are visiting from out of town. The prices aren't unreasonable for what is offered, and it is supper clean. The service is always great. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have to say what an awesome service at green house. food was exquisite , drink was amazing and our waitress Alexandra was just the best like great great personality. we ordered the braised short rib and the beef tenderloin so gooddddddd!!! Definitely coming back here and if alexandra is working i will be here asap for that great service"}
{"text":"The service was disagreeable... and it was a big bummer.  Mainly because all of there restaurants over the years have never let me down... Not only was he elusive and difficult to get any time with to ask questions or order... But when we asked about something his response was,\" They have improved the taste\" in a tone that made it sound undesirable  or   When we asked about Ginger Stout Cake \"it is just like this other dish Hot Chocolate \"Boca Negra\" Cake \" ...  The items sound very different on the menu but the waiter felt they were the same.  The Ahi tar tar tacos... the shell was too think and was not enjoyable... that really took away from the delicate ruby red tuna...  The Blueberry Crostata was good, but nothing set it apart from a diner's baked goods.   The menu seemed boring to me, and there was not much that popped out to me.  I did not feel like I was in California, it did not give me a fresh farmers market feel I get when dining in restaurants with a \"California\" feel... it seemed like an up graded chain restaurant.  I like the building and interior... that was my favorite part. I would go to North next store... same owner, but better management."}
{"text":"Our first Fox restaurant was Sauce, which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner.  Since then, it's been mostly down hill. We have been to Blanco twice, North once and now The Greene House.  My feeling with each of these places is that they're one or maybe two food items good.  The rest is just m'eh!    Clearly the Fox group knows how to make a very good, flavorful taco. Four Stars good, both here and at Blanco. As for the rest of the story, to paraphrase Paul Harvey....    We came here yesterday for a light lunch. I spotted the Tuna Tartar tacos on the menu and knew I had to try them.  At the time, I hadn't seen any of the posted pictures on Yelp. Too bad .  The tacos were three tiny, minuscule things about three inches wide.  Our server did try to warn us they were small and asked if I wanted a fourth?  Sure, I said. So three tiny tacos for $13.00 and the fourth for $4.50. Were they good?  Yes. Were they better than the ones down the street at Tommy Bahamas? Sadly no.   My lunch partner had their Fish and Chips for $15.00 and was very unimpressed.  \"Bland and nothing special, mushy and greasy\" were his exact words.  The lunch bill for two came to $38.75, along with one Iced Tea.  A little pricey for a Two and Half Star experience..   Sorry!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit out on the patio and enjoy a great, flavorful lunch.  I enjoyed the chicken club for lunch yesterday and wasn't disappointed...so very good and the fries were addicting as well!  Good service, great patio and great food!"}
{"text":"Made reservations on Open table, had to change twice and cancel then reschedule reservation.  Super accommodating on phone and then in person. Food and drinks were spot on. Had calamari, tuna tacos, Brie apps and fish for main w purée cauliflower. Service and food were great. Kudos to accommodating team for flaky customer."}
{"text":"Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Gotten the chicken pot pie to many times. Just as delicious each time. This pot pie is the PERFECT comfort food and has the best balance of flavors. Overall recommend for the relaxed atmosphere, bread on table, and great service."}
{"text":"A very cute place to have some lunch. Went here for Mother's Day and the service was great, very friendly staff and delicious food! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Was here a couple of days ago, food was fantastically fresh, I am rely not a Samon eater but I saw a couple of salmon orders going by, it was awesome over a salad!! Do it do it!!"}
{"text":"Everything  the waiter recommended was delicious .... The food was amazing"}
{"text":"One of my regulars for lunch.  Great salads and salmon.  Try the zucchini chips from nOrth next door; they will gladly fill the request with a separate bill.  Had a very good pasta special one evening."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I stopped in on New Year's day for lunch with my daughter and it was not crowded but the service and food were on point.   Everything was incredibly fresh and well made. California inspired cooking, light, simple ingredients that don't need too much fuss.  We had the wedge salad, mussels, truffle fries and brussel sprouts.   Wedge salad - crisp and fresh, dressing has a nice garlicky kick.   Mussels - delicious broth you can sop up with 2 wedges of grilled bread. Made with chunks of chorizo sausage that add a smoky finish.   Truffle fries - fresh crisp fries covered in freshly grated cheese and tossed with truffle oil....mmmm....  Brussel sprouts - nicely roasted and flavorful but more on the soft and tender side as opposed to crispy.  Great place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had a really lovely lunch here the week before Christmas.  The hostess noted that I was wearing dark denim and gave me a black napkin as she seated me so I wouldn't leave with white lint on my jeans.  What service!  We had the brie appetizer, two different salads, and split the blueberry cobbler.  All were excellent.  We went back just to try the lemon meringue pie the next day as carry out and it did not disappoint!   If you're staying at the Westin across the street, this place is better in terms of service, pricing, and food quality than the couple restaurants I tried on the hotel grounds."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a business trip with a few coworkers and really enjoyed it.  Everything is decently priced, the menu is broad without being mediocre, and the ambiance was warm and inviting.  My group really enjoyed the fondue, fries, flatbread sandwich, and the ribs.  Watch out though - the portions are massive!"}
{"text":"5 checkin's here - need I say more . Bar side service is quick and easy - awesome Martini's.."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie from Chicago so I was told to check out the FRC places. I have started with Greene house. I was lucky enough to have an amazing server named Mel. He was extremely knowledgeable on basically everything. I would def suggest the Pink & Greene martini. It may have been one of the best martinis I have had in a while. I would skip the horseradish potatoes. Good but not great. Def try the fish tacos. They are tapas size and super amazing!!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.  Jaclyn was a joy. Lively atmosphere. The hummus was a unique preparation excellent.  On to the pot pie which was yummy.  Molly will be back.   Me too."}
{"text":"Just across from banana republic. Menu reminded me of similar items at True Food Kitchen.  This place is nice and great location in Kierland, however, I think the food is tastier at TFK.  Sorry Greene House.  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Had turkey pita sandwich and chicken club I think?  Club was better."}
{"text":"The Greene House had been talked up by a few of my friends so I knew I had better check it out.  I am accustomed to the unique and delicious meals created at Tru Food and expected something better due to the higher prices, but it was not delivered. The service and atmosphere were great, but the entree I ordered was something that would come out of the Applebees kitchen.    I ordered the trout which is something normally prepared very simply and although the ingredient list in the meal's description did have quite a few ingredients it was how they were put together that ruined the meal.  When the dish was brought to the table I thought, \"this isn't mine\" because of how it looked.  Trout should be served very simply with no breading, gravy or anything else to cover the taste of the fish.  The people at the next table even commented on it.    I did bring this up to the server who also thought they overdo it on the trout.  My friend had another dish that was quite good.  I'll stick with Tru Food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Kierland. Nice outdoor patio and service is always great. The chicken sandwich is excellent as well as the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Great calimari. Ahi tuna was very yummy.  Great service too. Tuna tartare tacos were awesome, order 2! Another Sam Fox hit !"}
{"text":"O.K.  One of our vendors took me out to dinner at 'The Greene House', and I had the Bacon Wrapped pork loin.  That, and a really good zinfandel wine, and I was in heaven.  Everyone at the table was in love with their food, the waiters were cool, and the ambiance was perfect for the night.  If you find yourself at the Westin Kierland or just at the Commons, give this place a try.  You will have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for a fun, casual lunch. Located in Kierland Commons Shopping District next to North & Banana Republic. Small, contemporary dining room with casual cool ambiance. Seated and greated promptly and politely.   The server addressed my food allergies with sincere concern. Ordered the hummus to start which came with thick, warm freshly cooked pita bread triangles. The hummus was delicious! A twist on the usual with lime juice, creamy feta, red onion and grape tomatoes. A must have!  We both ordered the Green Goddess Salad with Seared Salmon, cooked to order, medium. Romaine tossed in a Green Goddess dressing with thinly shaved Romano Pecorino Cheese. Tossed in were bits of crisp snap peas, broccoli and pistachios.  Another favorite!   Prices were very reasonable. I paid $36 for the hummus, salad with salmon and a 9 oz pour of Pinot Grigio, also delicious.   If you're in the Kierland area make sure to stop here for a delicious and healthy lunch or dinner. The menu was impressively stacked with one of a kind good for you eats."}
{"text":"I really dug this place. Really!  So, I'm trying to eat healthy (I've got some sweet ass vacations lined up in the next couple months that I'm gonna be smokin' hot for)  Anyways, this place has a lot of great healthy option.  I got the turkey flatbread, and asked for a half portion.  Done!  They were happy to oblige.  For a side, I got the roasted vegetables.  Delicious!  They were very, very well seasoned.    Add some organic green tea to drink.... perfect meal. I didn't even feel like I was dieting.    I shall return."}
{"text":"Love the restaurants in Kierland, they all have their own unique vibe with delectable food. The style and layout of Greenhouse is not what you would normally see in Scottsdale and reminds me of an northeast restaurant on the coast. But this is another great Fox concept!   I came here for lunch and tried the chopped kale salad (without corn) and added some protein with chicken. It was delicious and tasted so healthy. My friend had the greenhouse salad, which she gets every time and another good choice. Service is good and portions are on the smaller side compared to the price.  Would love to try this place for dinner one night after reading all the entree reviews. Maybe Sunday night with a 1/2 bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"The Green House is a good place to stop while in Kierland Commons.  My wife and I have been here a few times. Pretty good Happy Hour food specials and the Chocolate Bars of Sin is the best dessert in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and has it all:  FANTASTIC food, top notch service, and great ambience.  I was in Phoenix for a work conference, and came here for lunch on a gorgeous October afternoon with two friends.  The menu looked fantastic, so we figured to get the most of our experience, we ought to share.  Here's what we ordered: Apps: 1. Roasted Beet Salad (generous with the succulent beets) 2. Fresh Pea Dumpling 3. Tuna Tartare Tacos  Main Courses: 1. Braised Short Rib (delectable - was my favorite) 2. Sweet Corn Cannelloni  3. Spicy Grilled Chicken Sandwich  Everything was well prepared and tasted amazing.  The short rib was perfectly done, so tender and well marinated.  Also, the portions were fairly generous.  There was plenty of food to go around.    The service was oustanding.  Our waitress was pleasant and had a good sense of humor.  The kitchen even split the salad three ways for us, without request.  My only complaint is that the Black and Blue Mojito was a bit difficult to drink because of the seeds, but the flavor was great.  Definitely check out this place. The wait would be worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to Greene House with my sister for dinner on a Friday night. It was busy, but not super busy.    We waited ten minutes before a server acknowledged us. We didn't even get an eye contact and \"I'll be right with you,\" when one of the three waiters that walked by our table.   This really put us in a funk because we had been really looking forward to eating here.   When our food came, my drink glass was empty, and our waiter set down our food and walked off. I thought he would come back, but I had to ask another waiter to get me a refill.   My sister got the turkey with hummus on pita, and felt it was way over priced for what she got. Same with my sandwich, it was decent, but I've had better. The best part of our meal was the salad dressing that came on our side salads.   I am a big fan of other Fox Concept restaurants (Blanco, North) and this just left me really disappointed."}
{"text":"When I'm out at a restaurant, the atmosphere must be just right. And of course the food and company! The Greene House made me feel like I was dining outdoors in California. Beautiful setting with attentive staff. On the pricey side but but the food quality is worth it. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here.  Great atmosphere, caring staff, and one of the best half chickens with sweet creamed corn I've ever had.  If you're on a date order a bottle of bubbly (they have one for $42 and it's excellent) have some muscles and potstickers, split a wedge salad and enjoy!  The pineapple upside down cake is a great choice for dessert.  Simple honest food, nuff said."}
{"text":"50% off wine on Sundays. Sold! I have been a couple of times and the service and food is ALWAYS fabulous. There hummas is some of the best that I have ever had. If you are ever in the area on a Sunday evening, run to The Greene House! The have a special on wine all day long and believe me, when you are catching up with a girlfriend, wine and appetizers go hand in hand. Plus they don't kick you out when you are the last patrons in the restaurants. Heck we were even able to order dessert as they were cleaning and they did it without batting an eye and with smile, even though they were truly ready to go :)"}
{"text":"Love their salmon! Service is quick and friendly. It's expensive but worth it. Not necessarily great for kids since it is more upscale and pricy. Wish their bathroom wasn't outside of the restaurant though."}
{"text":"I ate at the Greene House on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It wasn't busy at all which was nice, actually. Since I was traveling for work, I was dining alone.  My server (I think her name was Maryann) was excellent. Personable and attentive, she helped me choose a cocktail. I ended up with the Smashed Irishman which was whiskey, lemon juice, mint, honey and a Guinness reduction. It was delicious!  Since it was just me, I chose the Smoked Salmon Bruscetta with a side of mac n' cheese (because I can't help myself). The salmon bruscetta had this amazing horseradish sauce on it and was light and fresh but really satisfying. The mac n' cheese tasted like nothing more than penne with velveeta. Not impressed with that.  Overall, SUPER pleased with the whole experience. Have been thinking about that bruscetta ever since..."}
{"text":"Greene House is a reliably good place with a comfortable atmosphere, gracious wait staff, and tasty cuisine. Try the spinach-artichoke fondue. They also do an excellent job on their kobe beef burgers. The horseradish au gratin potatoes make for a delicious side dish. Great place to people watch, too."}
{"text":"The look and vibe pulled me in here for dinner. I had a couple of Kilt Lifter beers that were very good (just not quite cold enough) I ordered the Roasted Sea bass with Potato purée, Wilted spinach, Charred broccoli, Cipollini onion with Preserved lemon vinaigrette and capers. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service was very good (Natasha) and they made good recommendations. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a very nice bar. I enjoyed the ambiance and lighting. They had a nice mix on the menu which had a decent amount of choices. Bill for 2 and drinks (4) was around $100. I'd eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I had a fanastic lunch today. Started with a beautifully made Rye old fashion cocktail with dark cherries. The chicken pot pie was one of the best I have had as it was loaded with chicken, sweet potatoes and herbs. The crust was so flakey and scrumptious. I recommend saving room for their homemade donut with strawberries and custard. It was  soft, light and warm. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The trout is amazing and pineapple rum cake...to die for. Ask for Jude. Be is great."}
{"text":"The Greene House is one of my favorite spots. I've been many times for lunch and have never been disappointed. My choice menu items include their Chopped Kale Salad, Yellowtail Sashimi, Fish & Chips, and the French Dip sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been to The Greene House quite a few times and I'm extremely torn on the review, hence the 3 star rating. I think the decor is really nice as its low key and I like the layout of the restaurant. We've never had an issue with service here which is great because that is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to dining out.   In my opinion the food is inconsistent from a flavor standpoint. Sometimes they hit the mark (salads, tacos, fish & chips), and others, like the last meal I ate there (Parmesan Gnocchi) just don't. It was pretty bland, sauce and all, so I had to add quite a bit of seasoning with salt and pepper to amp it up.  As my friend Eric once said, \"Butter and salt are the reasons the food tastes so good at your favorite restaurant.\" Seasoning is key and Greene House just missed the mark for me on my last experience. However, I will be back to give GH another shot...60% isn't a failing grade and I know for a fact there are things I do really enjoy about this place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite No. Scottsdale spot for dinner!  Hubby & I went for Fashion Night Out at Kierland Commons and enjoyed their price fixe menu. (It saved us about $12) Starter - Smoked Salmon Bruschetta  Very smokey and plentiful. So good I took the leftovers home for breakfast the next day! Main Course-Short Rib with creamed potatoes, carrots and pearl onions.  They couldn't have prepared this dish any better in my opinion. Short rib was flavorful, moist and plentiful.  I had to take half of this home too.  The creamed potatoes were \"lick the plate clean\" good! Dessert-Chocolate Cake, this was my only disappointment-kind of bland or perhaps I was just plain too full to enjoy another bite!  We received great service and loved the comfortable, yet upscale feel. You may have missed Fashion Night Out, but don't miss this gem of a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Thought the food was okay, service was good and fast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Love the kale salad. It's wonderful! And the warm Brie appetizer is fantastic! I also love the scallop entree. I've never had anything I didn't like at the Greene House."}
{"text":"Just ate there last night with my girlfriend, and it was AWESOME!!!  The braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork, the cocktails are great, and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time yesterday while lunching with my girlfriends. When I arrived they were already seated on the patio which was a perfect place to enjoy the spring weather. Unfortunately, everyone else thought so too so we ended up sitting at a table with minimal room to move in the corner of the patio. The service was excellent (when our server was around ) but like others have said, the service is slow. I ordered a chicken salad with a curried yogurt dressing and an iced tea. Quite honestly I was more impressed with the iced tea, than the salad as it just didn't have any flavor. I will definately give this place another try so that I can absorb some of the ambiance this establishment has to offer and try something more tantilizing on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the calamari but literally got a plate of fried asparagus, onions and zucchini, Maybe two pieces of calamari.   The entrees were not great, shrimp pasta had four pieces of regular sized shrimp. The mahi tacos were less than satisfying.   Would have gotten dessert if everything else hadn't been terrible. Not worth the cost. Should have gone to Shake Shack next door instead.   Service was also very mediocre at best. However, the atmosphere was nice but didn't make up for the rest of the inadequacy. Don't be fooled by the nice looking restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really just medium. It has a great location but I sort of find it very over rated. Portions are tiny for their price and service could be more attentive.  It isn't a bad place but there are much better ones around"}
{"text":"Bright, airy decor.  Our waitress, Callie, was very hospitable and attentive.  Made us feel very welcome.  We had questions about the menu and she was very helpful.  We ordered Calamari and the crab and avocado dip.  The Calamari was incredibly good.  Not a lot of calamari.  It included tempura vegetables (also outstanding) and a fantastic red chile shoyu (not too spicy, a perfect complement to the calamari).  If you like calamari, you MUST get this.    For the main course, two of us had the caramelized sea scollops.  Cooked with bacon and complemented with a citrus vinaigrette, the were outstanding.  The citrus-flavored Crossings Sauvignon Blanc complemented the dish.  At Callie's recommendation, the other diner had the braised short rib and loved it.    I succumbed to temptation and, being an incurable chocaholic,  ordered the Chocolate Mocha Bars.  They did not disappoint.  Extravagantly rich.  Really too much for one person.  Buy and share.    Summary:  Good atmosphere to converse with friends.  Great service.  Really good food.  Priced fairly for the quality of the dining experience.  If in Scottsdale again, I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time over Memorial Day Weekend and we loved it! We started with the pot stickers and they were really good. Then we had the house made pasta dish and a nice bottle of wine. It was the perfect end to our long weekend. We loved the fresh, seasonal ingredients and our waiter was very friendly and seemed to enjoy discussing food which, we LOVE!!"}
{"text":"I was blown away at how incredible our food was. My husband had the pork tenderloin, and I had the half chicken dish. Both were impeccable. Flavors were off the charts! The cream corn and blanched green beans alone were amazing, but when you top it with a perfectly roasted (crispy on outside but perfectly tender and moist inside) chicken topped with tomato jam, it was out of this world! We finished our meal with the pineapple rum cake! It came with some amazing vanilla bean ice cream and crumble. So delicious! Our server was also very professional! Our entire experience was amazing, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Great outdoor patio. Really great service by Brittany. However, the food was sub par. Lettuce in the salad was already wilted when they put it on the plate. Fries were decent but nothing worth writing home for. The pot stickers were strange.. tasted fine but I believe a restaurant should always ask about sesame seeds on a dish like that prior to adding a half a bottle on to it. The broth that they're swimming in seemed useless and unnecessary. Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere just next to the Westin Hotel. We got lucky and got a table at the bar - it's a pretty busy place but worth the wait if you need to. The cheese plate was so good. And the entrees are nice too. The only thing that was a disappointment is that they don't even have their own bathroom in the restaurant. They send you outside to the public restroom with all the other strip mall goers. Other than that, food is good."}
{"text":"I entered the Greene house for my second time in my life with great hopes for an experience like my last. My previous venture into the venue of the Greene house was phenomenal with a perfectly cooked steak and creamy mashed potatoes. This time around the menu is changed (primarily for the worse) and I had a long wait ahead of me. My friends and I had a reservation for 7:30 and were seated at about 7:32. Punctual at best, the place was packed like sardines, but with such success a fine establishment like this shouldn't be troubled by a crowded venue. We sit down and order drinks from our wonderful waitress who was very nice. Unfortunately as the wait drew on for our food after ordering we lost more and more hope of ever receiving something to eat. We were brought our potstickers that we ordered about 30 minutes after we sat down and some Parmesan bread was also brought to help tide us over. However at the moment I am writing this it has been 1 hour since we ordered our food and about 45 minutes since we even contacted our waitress. All we can do is look on in agony and envy of other tables that are receiving their food as we wait for the glorious moment. You could even equate our table to Jesus himself with what seemed like a wait of 40 days and 40 nights in the hot Arizona desert. Finally we had our food brought to our table in the shining glory that we could barely make out at 8:30 at night. I ordered the skirt steak, and man was it the saving grace of this meal. The steak was a colorful blend of flavors and had a tingling remainder in my mouth even after I had inhaled everything like a vacuum. My amigos got the Mahi tacos which were very tasty according to him and my other amigo ordered the beet salad which according to him was a major hit. Overall The Greene House serves up great food, but the challenge is waiting long enough to receive it."}
{"text":"I came back after being turned away the first time due to \"no open seating\" despite the multitude of open reservations available online.    To my surprise we were actually seated!    Even though the host was occupied, the bar tender stepped up immediately and helped us get seated.  He greeted us well.  We were seated in a nice little nook next to a window.  The room was very, very noisy.  Even our server (who was very sweet and friendly) could not hear what we were saying.  The overly loud ambiance seemed commonplace based on our server's reactions to the noise.  I ordered the \"crispy chicken\" which tasted like something I could have pulled out of my freezer and heated in the microwave.  It was not crispy or even very flavorful.  It came with creamed corn, which was quite dense and way too salty.  Very yellow.  The presentation was nice, however.  I also tried the fondue appetizer.  It was good, not great.    Overall it was an okay place - its best quality being the service and employees.  But I will not likely return."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Sunday afternoon business lunch - stumbling into 1/2 price wine Sunday!  That's a nice way to start off the conversation!  Difficult to write a truly detailed review as we just had salads and sandwiches.  (The Asian Chicken salad was very tasty, but a little shy on chicken, and not very Asian!)  That said, we sat on the patio, enjoyed a nice Pinot Noir at a reasonable price, and soaked in the ambiance of the trendy little faux-neighborhood that IS the shopping district in this part of Scottsdale.  Looks like some great menu choices had we been looking for a more substantial meal.  So why the four stars?  Well, service was excellent, the food was tasty, and the ambiance was really quite lovely.  Would go back if in the area and had an excuse to do so!"}
{"text":"First of all, the only reason this rating isn't one star is because our waiter was phenomenal and actually made the experience bearable. I sent back the Fresh Pasta I ordered, and got the meatloaf instead. The pasta says it's made with pamesan cheese, spinach, and melted tomatoes, but I got this weird soupy bowl of pasta with some kind of buttery, fishy tasting sauce, about six spinach leaves and two sliced tomatoes that were not melted, but rather soggy. I will say the herb hummus appetizer was served with some of the best hummus I've tasted, but the bread and butter was some sort of cheesey bread with butter that was blended with some kind of pico de gallo mixture. It seemed as though for every good thing the restaurant had to offer, there was something worse to counter it. Our table also ordered the Trout, which was very good, but Trout is also famous for not tasting fishy....it seemed the fishy taste escaped and jumped straight into the \"fresh pasta\". YUCK. The atmosphere was crowded, noisy, and very poorly lit. And do not get there around 8 because there are only drunk bar slobs that you get to enjoy your meal next to, since of course you can't hear the people at your table as the drunks around you are screaming about Pablo Picasso and what not. Completely unsatisfied, a waste of a prime location if you ask me."}
{"text":"\"The Greene House - Inspired California Cuisine\"  What in the hell does that mean?  Oh wait, it must be referring to the fish taco on the menu.  But where's the sushi?  We all know Arizona is severely lacking in these fine culinary experiences.  Perhaps that is why the good chefs at Fox Restaurant have brought us \"inspired California cuisine,\" since us Arizonans could use some inspiration.  Well, hoping to be inspired, my aunt and I decided a break was in order from the Kierland experience, and Greene House it was.  We opted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather.  We even got the special treat of enjoying someone's cigarette smoke wafting toward us while another prospective diner contemplated going in.  Greene House can boast quite an eclectic menu offering something for everyone without having to resort to the catalog of a Cheesecake Factory, for example.  We opted for a roast beef sandwich and grilled turkey on flatbread.  The roast beef listed the \"raw or undercooked\" disclaimer; but in fact, the beef was well done.  I would prefer it not have been chopped, but with the addition of pickled red onions and fontina cheese, it was a tasty sandwich.  The turkey on flatbread is billed as including baby swiss, avocado, butter leaf, and hummus spread.  The hummus spread was what sold me on the sandwich; unfortunately, I never tasted it.  Not much avocado to speak of either.  We also ordered the fries kicked up with parmesan and white truffle oil.  Certainly destination fries if you're a fan of truffle oil.  Perfectly cooked, but served with ketchup.  Seriously?  Ketchup and truffle oil?  Not too inspiring on that one.  We had pretty good service, overall.  But the California lifestyle took hold, and our server disappeared for quite a while before bringing the check.  Perhaps he ran out to work on his tan.  Although I probably wouldn't make the drive just to dine at Greene House, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in for a meal next time I'm at Kierland.  Some of their entrees looked pretty appetizing."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture. By the restaurant's name, I expected a setting where all walls and ceiling are made of glass - just like a green house. I was wrong. It was a lot more cozy, yet still open and welcoming.   My friends and I were really impressed by the Fig and Ginger mule. It was sweet yet not too sweet and the ginger was really refreshing.  I let my girlfriends taste a small sip and they were hooked and both ordered their own.  The yellowtail sashimi with avocado and cilantro with  ponzu sauce came with 6 pieces of flavorful bites. We all wanted several servings but secretly fought over who would have the last one between the 5 of us.   I'm a huge fan of trout so it was no contest that the rainbow trout entree found its way in front of me. It was a large serving - one that could be split between a couple but not me. I was determined. I ate the whole bit. It was draped with succulent oven dried tomatoes and the tiniest conveniently bite sized fingerling potatoes, garnished with lemon and garlic.   For as busy as it was at lunchtime on a Thursday during a prime eating hour, surprisingly our service did not lag. Our waitress was patient as we made our decisions and handled separate checks seamlessly. She was kind, attentive, and made the end of our pleasant hour or so there worry-free! I can't believe that I missed this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The name really doesn't do this place justice. To me, a name like \"Green\" makes me think that this place is going to be uber healthy and while the products are fresh and delicious, it's not your overly health conscious restaurant. It's just a eatery that offers a variety of delicious freshly made products and has a nice atmosphere to go with it.  I've eaten here several times and I've had a great experience each time. When the weather behaves, the patio is a perfect option and it's in the heart of Kierland, making for some fun people watching and a nice ambiance.  During lunch, I've enjoyed the hummus and Kale Cesar salad which are both good and have fresh ingredients. During my last visit, I had the spinach and artichoke fondue and fish tacos. The fondue was to die for and I highly recommend that you order it immediately! The fish tacos came with two tacos that were hearty enough to fill me up. We ended the meal with their delectable pineapple upside down rum cake. Like I said, this restaurant doesn't exude \"healthy,\" but instead it's the perfect happy medium. You can eat healthy if you want, or you can eat hearty and enjoy things like a Kobe burger or Chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. The food was good and the beer was good, but it was expensive for what it was. Nothing really blew my mind. It feels like it's trying really hard to be fancy but the food isn't up to snuff. The portions for the entrees are pretty small as well."}
{"text":"Service was very good. The 3 stars are due to the service and my dining partner enjoyed his food. I'm Vegan and was really hoping with a name like \"The Green House\" I would have a few options. There are NO Vegan options on the menu. The server was kind enough to have the kitchen adjust the hummus appetizer for me to make it veg friendly. It was just ok, nothing great, and I left lunch pretty hungry. I wouldn't personally return."}
{"text":"My friend decided to she wanted to try this place out for one of her birthday meals. She made reservations though we didn't need them since it was pretty empty at 6 on a Wednesday. My first thought when I walked inside..\"this is cute!\". We wanted to sit outside so luckily they had heat lamps hanging above almost every table, it was perfect and cozy. We both ordered the grilled chicken club; our server was very attentive and we got our food pretty fast. In an attempt to be \"healthy\" instead of fries I ordered mixed greens with the sandwich. It looked great when it came out though I felt like the plate looked a little empty... like it was missing something. Surprisingly the sandwich was delicious! I thought it was going to be a mediocre bland chicken breast but the chicken and cheese, avocado, bacon and other ingredients worked great together. The salad was pretty good too; it was tossed with some sort of vinaigrette. My friend had a voucher for a comp birthday dessert so she ordered the cinnamon and sugar donut..it was good, but not great.  It seems like a great place for a dinner with family or a business meeting."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister's birthday dinner! I had the lemon drop drink (it was delicious) and the mahi tacos. I liked the tacos but what really was out of this world was my sister's side of mac and cheese! I know what I am getting next time! Quaint little restaurant and north is attached to it! I love all of Fox Concepts Restaurants."}
{"text":"The name implies this Fox Restaurant Concepts is big on salads, and that conclusion would not be wrong.  The menu is somewhat limited.  There are not a lot of choices if you do not want a salad.  However, the entrees my wife and I had were just outstanding!  She had the French dip and it might be the best one either of us ever tasted.  The tender beef slices had a genuine barbeque (I mean \"cooking\" barbeque not sauce) smoky aroma and taste to them, as if the roast had just come off the grill, with the crusty edges done just right.   Combined with the au jus and bun this item was full of flavor and seasoned to near perfection.  Be sure to try this entrée.  I had the fish and chips.  Normally I would have eaten only half the order and taken the rest in a to-go box, but it was so good I can't believe I ate the whole thing!  The coating was nice and crunchy and remained so throughout the meal.  The fish, ID'd by our server as \"rock fish\",  was moist, tender, and flavorful.  The fish nearly melted in my mouth.  I would come back for this again and again.  I cannot say enough about our server, Sarah.  She might be the best server we have had anywhere in sometime.  Not only was she friendly and pleasant, but she was very knowledgeable about the menu and so attentive, to the tiniest detail.  At one point I knocked my knife off the table.  No big deal, I'll just ask for another.  By the time I got that thought in my head, she was there presenting my another knife, carefully cradled in a napkin.  How she heard that knife hit the floor is beyond me because this restaurant, like other Fox RC facilitlies, lacks any acoustical dampening; it can get loud in there.  Sarah also brought my wife an extra straw and it, too, was cradled in a napkin.  Sarah filled our water and tea glasses without us ever having to ask.  She was there at the appropriate times to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything.  Her timing is impeccable as we never felt she was intruding on us at all.  Although we were both full, she recommended their Chocolate Mocha Bar desert, promising we would like it.  Sarah tells no lies.  It might be the best desert we have had in years.  Two rectangle logs of creamy ganache coated with decadently rich dark chocolate resting on dusted cocoa powder and accented with raspberries soon arrived at our table.  OMG!   Thank Gawd we only ordered one or I'd be headed to the store to buy bigger pants!  It was so good, it would be worth it to go to the Greene House just for that.  If you go, ask if Sarah is working and sit in her station.  You won't be disappointed.  Fox RC knows how to get it right and they did here.  PS:  I forgot to mention in my original review that, because it was our first visit, Sarah comped our desert!!!  How amazing is that?!?!?  You want to have repeat customers, treat them like this and offer great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"There must be a trend among Scottsdale restaurants to re-do their menus this month. It seems like every where I have been going, there are new menus which is great!  And this is a good thing for Greene House. When they first opened I really thought they were good. But then it went down hill....fast. Now with the new menu,,,they get 3 stars from me. They no longer have their 3 different menus like they once had. They now have one for the whole day which can be bad or good. There is alot more to choose from compared to before. More salads...which are monstrous! More entrees to choice from too. I had the Tomato eggplant panni which was pretty dry. It came with a \"side salad\" that was baby greens with sea salt dressing. Seriously the greens were too salty to eat. I had a couple bits then had to drink a gallon of water. And then of course I had to walk outside to get to the bathroom!  My friends had the Mahi Mahi Tacos and I guess they were pretty tasty, along with the navy bean corn casserole side thing! I wish I would of ordered this instead. The best part of course was the dessert! My friends had the Strawberry rhubarb cobbler, I heard it was divine. I, on the other hand, am a chocolate fanatic so I had to try the hot chocolate cake with walnuts and whip cream. De-lish!  So if you have been to Greene House before and did not like, give it another try!"}
{"text":"Greene house has fantastic food with a comforting atmosphere. I can recommend the Kobe Burger Sliders, the Tacos, & Asian Chicken Salad. Also my Americano was double yummy.  Reservations are good for peak hours."}
{"text":"Treated a friend to lunch today, our first time dining here.  Food & service were outstanding.  I ordered the French dip sandwich with Brie cheese, seriously the best one I've ordered anywhere!  My side of truffle fries were crispy & perfectly seasoned.  I usually try to leave a dainty amount on my plate, but it was so good I polished it all off.  My friend got the wedge salad with grilled chicken which she loved.  Think I found my new go spot at Kierland.  'Tis noisy inside, hope to try their patio once the weather cooperates."}
{"text":"i came here for a work event, so keep that in mind. it was a little loud inside but what restaurants aren't these days?  we had the set menu which included:  delicious green salad with avocado (i think it was the greene house salad with avo) roasted chicken over a beautiful creamed corn and served with tomato jam  dessert was a really yummy pineapple rum cake  and the red blend chosen was also very good!  no complaints, definitely enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Was last here about 3 years ago and enjoyed the experience, tonight, not as much.  Arrived at 5pm and the place was pretty empty, about 6 tables outside and 4 inside with patrons so not busy by any means.  We were greeted by our server and our drinks arrived timely.  Order the flat bread and fondue artichoke dip and found it to be very pleasing.  Another waitress came to our table for a lemonade refill and brought back the wrong drink.   Ordered the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon and waited...and waited...and waited almost 25 minutes for it to arrive to the table.  The male who was the food runner had zero personality and served us each the wrong plate.  Had to literally flag someone down to exchange them since they were so hot, they couldn't be touched let alone moved.  The potatoes served under the meat were a bit overcooked and burnt.  Not light nor fluffy.  The tenderloin was tasty but as we progressed with the meal, the taste was saltier and saltier.  Ordered the Mac and Cheese side and my goodness, it was made up of noodles with some butter and parmesan cheese on top truly that was it and nothing more!  This was a far cry from any restaurant style of mac and cheese we'd ever had and it was plain, dull and boring!  We could not even believe this was on the menu or served here - a TOTAL disappointment!  The waitress during dinner was no where to be seen and never came back to ask us how the dinner was.  We watched her walk by the couple next to us and shout out to them \"how is it, is it good guys\" as she passed right on by.  Not very service oriented.  It took about 10 minutes after we finished to have our plates cleared.    Overall the $22.00 dinner entree was in my opinion, no where near the quality of a $22.00 pork dish, more like $16.00.  We would have stayed for dessert but we were afraid it would take too long so opted to head over to Tommy Bahamas for dessert - which was amazing!!!  While the restaurant did get busier while we were there, considering we arrived with not even 25% of the place filled and the order took 25 minutes and the staff appeared to be unorganized, a bit overwhelmed and didn't seem to be too concerned that people were sitting around staring wondering where their food was...not sure I'll be back any time soon and certainly will not suggest this place in the Kierland area, too many other service oriented restaurants.  Maybe they do better at lunch with a smaller crowd?"}
{"text":"Sitting outside in the patio is recommended for various reasons. It's quieter. There's fresh air. You can people watch: the beautiful peeps of Scottsdale. Serving is top notch. The menu is one of my favorites. Last year, they had trout; this year they had sea bass which was cooked perfectly wet. I had the roasted half chicken which rivaled Maui's HGS. The chicken came with cream corn. We split an incredible beet salad on butter lettuce. For dessert, we had panna cotta with fresh strawberries and strawberry sorbet on top. As for the wine, you can order it in various sizes which I thought makes ordering fun! Again, the service is super good from the time you call to the time you leave with a happy face."}
{"text":"Best meal we have had on our vacation in Arizona. We started with the Calamari. It was a good portion. Very light and crisp. Not oily or heavily battered. Served with lots of tempura veggies. We split the beet salad. Delicious! Citrus roasted beets, butter lettuce, whipped goat cheese... perfection. I had the scallops. Seared perfectly. Generous portion of 5 served with cauliflower and snow peas. My husband had the sea bass. It came out from the kitchen a bit overcooked. They immediately took it back and recooked it and the redo was flaky and everything you expect sea bass to be. The service was friendly and attentive. Best service we have had in Arizona. We had actually begun to wonder if unfriendly service was just a thing in this area and this restaurant made us reconsider that. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious fish & chips served in a cheerful cafe atmosphere by pleasant waitstaff made for a lovely lunch. Worth the wait and parking challenges."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there last night.everything was just ok. It's not very busy.    Hard to figure Fox keeping this place. It seems to be the weak link."}
{"text":"I liked everything.  I liked my wine...a Pinot Noir called Windy Bay. I liked the truffle fries. I liked potstickers. And I liked the trout after we had some extra sauce.  Oh, and I liked the bread with the bacon chive butter...yum.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give any Fox Restaurant less than 5 stars because I absolutely love this concept! I heard great things about The Greene House from my co-workers so I decided to check this place out. The inside is really nicely done and very clean. The service was just mediocre--not enough interaction with our server but he was a nice young man nonetheless.   The menu was extremely short, I felt like there wasn't enough creativity put into it. Lots of entrees and salads with fish and chicken, there's one burger (just your standard Kobe burger) and maybe 2 sandwiches on the menu. I guess I was just really expecting to have more options like other Fox Restaurant's have to offer. I order the grilled chicken sandwich (I wasn't in the mood for fish today), and I know other restaurants in this concept have a talent for turning a simple dish into something brilliant. The fries were pretty good though! Overall, I just feel like there was a lot lacking in flavor and creativity behind the menu.   Maybe I'll try it again later and order something more exciting but for now, my experience was just alright."}
{"text":"I love The Greene House! The first time I came here it was actually by accident that I walked into the wrong restaurant but I decided to stay. I'm so glad I did because everything I've had has been so yummy! My most recent visit I ordered the fig & ginger mule {Figenza fig vodka | Ketel One | lime | pomegranate | ginger beer} It was something out of the ordinary and it was really good. Not super figgy like how I expected but light and fresh. These days I am trying to have some self restraint when ordering so I opted for the chopped kale salad for my entrée. The salad consisted of grapefruit, pistachio, roasted corn, and an Amish cheddar vinaigrette. I added shrimp at an additional cost. Everything was perfectly balanced- the grapefruit contrasting with the sweetness of the corn and the perfect amount of dressing. Don't you hate when your salad is soaked?!   In the past I've tried the chicken tortilla soup, black mussels, warm Brie, tuna tartare tacos, scallops, and grilled mahi tacos- all of which I recommend! You just can't go wrong at The Greene House."}
{"text":"We had very cute outside table.  Restaurant wssnt busy but took at least 15min get a drinks. We never get bread.  Portions were pretty small.  My beets salad had no dressing and beets tasteless only shrimps was ok. Salmon was good but garnish ed with same beets. And second round of drink came after we psid bills."}
{"text":"Greene House has a 3.5 star average on 148 reviews and that seems, frankly, a little high. In fact, I considered giving the place a lower rating just to overly screw the the cumulative results, but I am not going to exploit Yelp's system to further push my own beliefs onto others (take note Yelp Elite committee).  After a lunch date with orders of potstickers, kobe burger + potatoes au gratin, mahi tacos, and a donut, the three most memorable items were the potatoes, drinks (berry lemonade is good), and John Mayer walking past our patio table. As others have mentioned, the service is good and the restaurant is as nice as any other Fox joint but, considering it is a FRC, the menu just comes off as lazy. In fact, looking back, it seems like Greene House is the result of an intern coming in and designing a restaurant after seeing what FRC has done with their other places.   Swing and a miss. When we get back to the Commons, we will likely try the other restaurants."}
{"text":"These guys didn't bat an eye when I asked for a table for one. (Oh, lonely business trips.)  The restaurant's supposed to be in a California style. Having lived in California for five years, I didn't think they got it exactly right, but I could see what they were going for. The decor was fresh and clean but unromantic. The clientele seemed to be either business people or families, and it was crowded but I was seated right away. They have a nice outdoor seating area.  I found the service quick and unobtrusive (they let me read my book in peace but kept my water filled), and I ordered the seared ahi tuna with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. The entree was almost perfect. Everything was delicious, but part of the fish was overcooked. Seared should be just seared, and one of the ends had been cooked almost all the way through. Other than that, though, the flavors were fantastic, the fish was fresh, and I plan to come here again the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Always pleased with FOX restaurant, this place is no exception. I came here for lunch this week and was happy with the food served.  I had scallops for lunch. I don't think they have special lunch menu. Perfect portion size for lunch, perhaps a bit small for dinner if you just have scallops. Price was good for dinner but was a bit pricy for lunch, (more than I normally pay but perfect for a special occasion). Scallops was cooked perfect, easy to overcook scallops but they did it right. Nice flavor, I thought it would go well with a glass of wine. Too bad I had to go back to work on that day.  Somehow I was convinced I should order a desert and so glad I did. They serve my kind of desert here. Panna Cotta. It was creamy, right amount of sweetness, blood orange was a perfect mix with creamy panna cotta, sweetness and citrusy went well, creating really refreshing light desert. This desert doesn't make you feel heavy at all.  Service was excellent. He was attentive and friendly with a nice smile. Located at the Kierland Common, because of price I can't be a regular but definitely would come back again when I want really nice lunch."}
{"text":"Clients of mine said they'd like to take me to lunch, saying, \"Bonnie, you pick the place.\"  Kierland was sort of in the middle, so I said, \"How about The Greene House.\"  Wise pick on my part.   I had the turkey on grilled flat bread.  The bread was very tasty; seemed flavored, not like the bland flat bread I've had in the past, and, yes, it is grilled.  The turkey and lettuce was delish.  I would have liked there to be more turkey than lettuce, though.  It felt a little like a salad in a sandwich.   Considering it was so tasty, I won't complain about that.  The parmesan fries on the side were hot off the fryer.  The sandwich was definitely good regardless of the amount of lettuce.   My clients had The Greene House Salad.  Well named.  Everything about it was green.  She said it was very good, and she liked the combination of flavors.   Another had the iceberg wedge salad.  I must admit, I'm not an iceberg lettuce kind of gal, but she really liked it.    Lastly, the fourth order was the Asian Chicken Salad.  He said it was quite tasty.  It looked as though it had the right amount of chicken and other ingredients.   The service was fantastic.  I think the manager even came over and asked how we liked everything.  Nice touch on a busy work day lunch."}
{"text":"Kierland Commons has a number of good restaurants.  On this visit, tried another Fox Restaurants Concept establishment and found you can't go wrong with this group.  The complimentary table bread was dense squares of a parmesan-herb concoction.  Delicious!  My salmon salad was a tiny disappointment in that, while the salmon was tender and moist, it could have used a bump of herbs or dressing to add more flavor.  However, combined with a bite of the vinaigrette coated salad greens, it came to life.    I couldn't pass up the excellent dessert list and settled on the warm cinnamon and sugar donut that came with a custard dip and berry sauce.  My server's detailed descripton of his fav, Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin, was pretty appealing so I guess I'll have to visit again soon!   Liked the open, yet cozy, feel of the restaurant, and the server was attentive even though I was a party of one.  Prices ranged from $9 for an iceberg wedge salad to $26 for grilled filet medallions.  Salads were in the $8-$16 range.   A number of yummy side dishes were listed for $7 each."}
{"text":"I joined my Girlfriend and her Uncle for dinner on a Sunday night at Greene House. The staff that night must have been their B Squad, as the service was pretty awful for this caliber of restaurant. However the food was amazing and the wine specials on Sunday are great, half priced. I ordered the Rib-Eye and it was absolutely perfect, my girlfriend ordered the Pasta with Shrimp which was equally as good. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for excellent food and a casual dinning experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately customer service by management is obsolete at this establishment. We ordered calamari, which had more tempura vegetables than calamari. Then when our orders came, my husbands was uncooked ravioli. Waitress agreed and asked him if he wanted something else. He chose ahi tuna. I was done eating and we waited an additional 15 minutes after I was done for his meal to arrive. So I ate alone and he ate alone. When we received our bill, they up charged us for the ahi, no apologies, nothing.   Will NEVER go back. Way too many other choices in Scottsdale that cater to their clientelle."}
{"text":"During another one of our very rare trips to this \"posh\" Kierland Commons area, we found ourselves hungry for something different, we walked by the Greene House, actually the baker's window at the Greene House.  Turns out it is a small station where smaller plates are arranged in the restaurant, a Garde-manger almost, where salads and breads came out, I think I even saw some desserts potentionally being cooked up there.  Nevertheless, the friendly face behind and the intriguing display window drew us in.  It was lunch time on a saturday, the place was pretty busy.  We walked in wearing clothes that didn't scream out Scottsdale, but more of the quiet, Millionaire Next Door type of look, needless to say, we didn't get seated at a very good spot.  Wearing our t-shirts and jeans got us an awkward table that felt like it was below the bar.  Half of our lunch was eaten with a waiters butt in our faces.  It's not exactly the type of warm buns I was hoping for with my butter.  The food, being avid and experienced fish and chips lovers, to try the Greene House's rendition was a must, we are no strangers to the great old fashioned greasy spoon fish and chips from accross the pond, England.  The result? Surprising, the fish was good quality white fish, if I had to guess, possibly black cod, it came with fries, not chips. \"Chips\" meaning big potatoe wedges that are finger length.  Nope they were just regular ole fries, a mound of it, with two small portions of the fish.  The plate was not balanced, the fries outweighed the fish (the main attraction) by a good 5 to 1.  Wow.  We asked our very waiter who kept asking us if wanted anything to drink besides our ice cold water, are the Kobe Beef Twin burgers made from grass-fed cows?  I thought, Kobe beef, it has to be, you mean to tell me a cow that gets massaged gets to eat grains?!  I thought there was no way that he would come back saying it wasn't grass-fed beef, I expected a lie, a lie that would have made me feel happier.  Nope, the Kobe beef is from grain fed bovine. That's right... the waiter got 1 point for honesty, and chef, 0.  For those who know their meats, beef that is grain fed is like.... humans who only get their vitamins sources from pills and not fruits and meat, un-natural and frankly kinda gross.  When the twin burgers arrived they were small, sliders small.  Why not call them sliders?  The \"house pickles\" are these strangely marinated curried cucumbers.  Who's idea was that?  It overpowered the meat, something that should stand alone really being KOBE no?  The beef could have maybe, and that's maybe passed for Angus, Kobe? Not a prayer.  On the upside, the parmasan, truffle fries were good though.  So, I guess I can't really judge this restaurant to its fullest yet, I saw potential in the menu, but also I saw a lot of pretentious combinations that should have been left off the menu, at least simplefied.    I will be back to this place one day, and that time, I will be dressed like David Beckham, wear sunglasses indoors, throw on a sportscoat and possibly designer jeans.  Maybe just maybe, then will I have a shot at sitting at one of the great seats in the house where you can see folks walk by outside, or the beautiful open kitchen they have.  Don't miss: The patio seating and atmosphere at night Skip:  the bar half of the restaurants, seats are badly placed, and save your cash with Kobe burgers that barely surpass the gut-bombs from White Castle.    For now Greene House, you get a 3 out of 5. Not good enough."}
{"text":"I've been here three times recently for their 1/2 wine bottle special on Sunday nights.  Every time I've had a great experience.  This last visit we started with a bottle of Angeline pinot noir.  It was refreshing and started things out on exactly the right note.  For dinner I had the braised short ribs.  These babies are tender and melted in my mouth.  Absolutely delicious!  The second bottle of wine was a gorgeous Ladera cabernet savignon.  It went perfectly with the short ribs.  For dessert the caramel gelato was just right.  The decor and service are always first class here.  I can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful date night here.  Excellent food, atmosphere, and wine. The server was attentive, knowledgeable and gave excellent recommendations! We will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a reservation at The Greene House at the insistence of my foodie friend.  She claimed that I had to go for the doughnut!  So we did...  We had to wait about 5-10 minutes, even with a reservation, and the bar area was packed...we stood hovering at the door with other couples in anticipation of our feast.  We were greeted promptly and ordered wine.  As we perused the menu, it was determined that because we were definitely getting the doughnut, I would forgo an appetizer and ordered the Braised Short Rib.  My husband, however, was intrigued by the tortilla soup and fish tacos, which came highly recommended by our server.    He returned shortly after taking our order with a basket of bread and butter...my excitement peaked and then fell when I placed my hand on a cold dense roll; I was hoping it would be fresh and warm, but sadly it was the butter that was warm and melty.  The tortilla soup arrived and I quickly asked for a second spoon; I need to at least taste it!  My husband stirred the dollop of cream and tortilla strips into the brothy soup and took a taste...no response.  My spoon arrived, I took a taste, and found it to be lacking flavor depth and heartiness that tortilla soup is famous for. Even my husband suggested it needed some citrus or fresh herbs...maybe even a little more heat.  Not thrilled, and didn't even finish it.  When our entrees arrived, my foodie excitement reappeared as the Braised Short ribs were placed in front of me...glistening in a demi-glaze the short rib----though no rib to be seen- sat atop a smooth pool of potato puree and was topped with a large onion and small nubs of carrots and a piece of celery greens.  The flavor was spot on, though nothing out of the ordinary or flavor popping and the meat was literally melt-in-your mouth.  At first I thought there wasn't enough, maybe because it was so tender and yummy I didn't want it to end, but as we got closer to the end of our meal, I found that  I couldn't finish it.  Oddly, however, my usually non meat-eating husband, found it within himself to take one for the team by eating the final bites of the tender goodness; he couldn't even resist! His tacos, he said, didn't thrill him.  While the waiter bragged about the portion of fish used in their tacos; we didn't seem to think so.  As a result, I didn't even want to take a bite so as to leave more for my honey...so sadly, I can not report on the tacos...though he did let me take a bite of the white bean salad that was on the side, which was quite flavorful.  Then came dessert....we knew we wanted, as it came highly recommended, so we ordered it blindly.: the doughnut.  I was sad, however, to see that there was NO chocolate whatsoever; not dripped, none to dip, not a chip!  I was happy to see they give you the WHOLE doughtnut....hole and all, and along side the cinnamon-sugared-fried sweetness was a small ramekin of vanilla bean custard with a dollop of strawberry.  My husband enjoyed it very much, whereas I had only a few bites...it's more like a classic doughnut than the krispy kreme in that it was more dense than I would have preferred and not enough custard to compliment the dryness of the doughnut itself.  Overall, it was ok...though I don't think we would go back."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and that was good. My friend had the braised rib and it was yummy. Braised rib must be a common dish in this area as they have it on a few menus at the restaurants in the area.   We ordered a couple of desserts that were good.   Service was lacking. I know we were sitting in the bar area, but waited forever to order after we said we needed one more minute."}
{"text":"I'd be hard-pressed to say what NOT to get here.  Roasted half chicken with creamed corn, tomato jam, and green beans - fantastic.  Braised short ribs on cheddar grits - still raving about these. Greek pitas and hummus, pineapple rum cake, yum yum yum.  The service was top notch and friendly making for a wonderful evening.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 and everyone walked away very impressed with the service and the good. Our waitress did a fantastic job and didn't even blink an eye at us all needing seperate checks. Well done."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Greene House since it opened many years ago. Sadly, this favorite restaurant just moved to the bottom of my list. Last night's dining experience, a birthday celebration no less, was marred by a terribly over-cooked sea bass entree with tough broccolini which, when sent back, returned a while later (as my companions were completing their meals) with the same problems. I have had this dish three times previously in the past 5 months and it was excellent. The waitress demonstrated no interest in how the dish should have been prepared (it even LOOKED overcooked). The manager did stop to check on our table when the second dish was served and apologized, taking the item off of our bill. The people at the table next to us were also complaining about the quality of one of their dishes. Something is very wrong in the kitchen, and there was no chef on duty. And of course, I ended up with no dinner as I wasn't going to order a third time now that my dining mates were done. The restaurant is also looking a little shabby: seats are broken down, table was not that clean when we were seated (which we indicated to the waitress, who did nothing), and so on. Overall a very disappointing experience. We used to recommend this restaurant to our friends but for now those recommendations will stop."}
{"text":"Pretty good eats for lunch. Had the mahi tacos. Good portion and great flavor. Don't miss the white wine sangria. YUM!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for the half priced bottle of wine as they have some great reserve bottles.  I'm not sure why but I never noticed the guy in the back hand making the pasta.  It's fun to watch but even more fun to eat. If you aren't into fresh pasta, they have a good selection of comfort foo.  The patio is good sized and when the weather is nice the bar area is pretty open."}
{"text":"My first two trips to Greene House were years ago... they hadn't been open for long and both trips were for dinner and left much to be desired. I didn't return until recently when we met some friends for a late lunch on a Saturday...  Lunch is the way to go at Greene House!  It was a beautiful day and we sat on the patio... the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fresh and filling.  It's a tad bit on the expensive side, but worth a splurge for a nice lunch every now and then...  We started with a brie appetizer and a plate of roasted veggies.  Both were delicious.  I had the Asian Grilled Chicken Salad as my entree and was totally satisfied; I'm usually picky with my chicken and this chicken passed the test... I'd order it again in a heartbeat!  Lesson learned: Greene House is perfect for a lunchtime splurge!"}
{"text":"Omg total foodgasm. Reward for mailing my taxes this afternoon is THIS. Holy cow these chefs know their way around memorable food!  Behold braised short ribs (perfectly carmelized and tender), smoked cheddar grits, charred onion, grilled zucchini and wild mushrooms and spectaular beefy wine sauce from scratch, garnished with cilantro. Highly recommend. (Also had beet salad on goat cheese mousse with pistachios and balsamic reduction sauce, and a homemade donut with custard and fresh strawberries.).  Jeez what an afterglow!!!!!  Super service as well. I'll be back. Often."}
{"text":"Had a lovely experience here!  My company wanted to show me around Kierland Commons as I had never been. After parking, we walked along the beautifully lite street, enjoying the warm evening air. The Greene House stood out to us from the sidewalk. It was an open concept restaurant that had tables flowing out to a stunning, candlelit patio. As we entered the front door, the ambiance was equally as spectacular. The soft lighting was soothing, but also sexy and inviting. We saddled up at the bar.   I'm usually a wine drinker, but their signature cocktails looked enticing - a refreshing beverage sounded great. My eyes narrowed in on a  jazzed up Moscow Mule - one of my favourites! It was a Fig, Pomegrante Mule and boy was it delicious.   We wanted to check out some other spots in the area so we only had the one drink, but I will definitely be back here to try their food - it smelled exquisite!  Thank you to the bartender who was kind, prompt and made our first visit a pleasure."}
{"text":"We just had a fabulous meal at The Green House for Az Restaurant Week.  We started off with the warm Brie served with tart cherries, crusty bread, roasted garlic and nuts...delicious! The green house signature salad was also amazing and light with pistachios and avocado.  My main course was the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon..OMG! Perfectly cooked, tender pork (which is impossible for me to do at home). This was served with horseradish potatoes..delish! I was stuffed but I couldn't stop eating. For dessert we had the pineapple upside cake..nice crunchy texture on the bottom...wonderful sauce that wasn't too sweet.  All and all it was a great meal. I would recommend making a reservation as the last time I came I saw a lot of people not being able to be seated right away without one with a lengthy wait.  Excellent service..the manager even stopped by to see how we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for brunch. Especially on Sundays - Half priced bottles of wine! HELLO! Can't beat that!   Food is amazing and I assume is fresh because it tastes fresh - not like it's been frozen."}
{"text":"The Greene House is one of my favorite places to eat. Located in the center of Kierland Commons, it is a great restaurant for a night out. They start every meal with a super delicious cheese topped bread. I usually like ordering a couple of appetizers as a meal here just so I can try different things. The last time I was there I got the Smoked Salmon and the Potstickers. The sauce that came with the Potstickers was so good I almost licked it off the plate. The bread that came with the oysters was so amazing and garlicky. I've had a lot of great food here over the past couple of years and can't wait for my next meal at The Greene House."}
{"text":"It is a pretty cool place.  All the hardwood furniture and windows looking outside.  The service is great!  Not the restaurant's fault, but the screaming kid (45 mins) made my head hurt!  SPINACH & ARTICHOKE FONDUE - Delicious...   CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Perfect to warm up the soul CRISPY HALF CHICKEN - This was so good, I would just come back for this"}
{"text":"Wandered in here after attempting to have dinner at Postino first and walking out on that awful experience; so glad we did!! Greene House was excellent.  The server was friendly and explained things perfectly. We had a turkey on flatbread, and fish tacos for our entrees, along w/a side of mac and cheese.  The restaurant was busy but not packed, and they didn't sit you on top of one another like so many places do.  The food came out quickly and was perfect; had everything we expected and the server checked on us often to see if we needed everything.  We will def. be back soon, and enjoy their beautiful patio and great ambiance."}
{"text":"What an excellent evening. Ryan was an amazing server. It was my friends birthday and he completed my request of having the whole staff sing happy birthday. We had amazing table-side service, graciousness, and an excellent wine suggestion. I would definitely suggest the chateau moulin de tricot. For the price range, it is an excellent alternative to the normal go-tos such as Caymus. We will be back to ask for Ryan specifically!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner.  We go there quite a bit since we work up in the Quarter.  The Turkey/hummus/pita entree is very good.  Good place to try if you like other Fox Concepts spots...which I do"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite new restaurant that serves the best grilled chicken I have ever had! It's absolutely so tender and to make it even better, it was sitting on top of creamed corn. TO DIE FOR!! I think what really made this dish spectacular is the tomato sauce that was used to compliment the chicken. It wasn't like any other sauce, it was different to perfection. you would think it would be warm but it was cold; salsa texture & temperature. Definitely compliments your palettes in spectacular ways.   The service was average, nothing amazing. Very simple & to the point. No complaints.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was average, I had the Butternut Squash Pasta there was too much going on in the dish. Didn't care for pistachios, tomatoes in the dish. Location and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to this restaurant since I moved to AZ. I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day. I had my hopes up but I wasn't really impressed.  We were squeezed into a corner table, the service was decent, and it was quite noisy . I didn't feel that I was able to experience the vibe of the restaurant being in the corner. I order pasta w/breadcrumbs/mushrooms, and I ended up returning it. It just didn't taste right. Desert menu was a disappointment as well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"all flash and no substance.  i had ravioli.  waitress raved about their pasta and how it was homemade.  that may be, but it was also very undercooked.  almost raw. really no getting past something like that."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I can't agree with the majority on this one. While the restaurant is what it is billed to be it just isn't that great.  My partner ordered cannelloni and it was the smallest dish of pasta I've ever seen. I had a bistro steak salad which despite being ordered medium was delivered rare. Lunch for $30 and I only drank water? That's way too much for appetizer size portions.   I like Kierland and most of the restaurants, but The Greene House just isn't that great. Too noisy, too Scottsdale (yes, I know it's in Phoenix) and too fake.  On to the next review."}
{"text":"Hot! stupid, slow.  Lame. Poor management. Hot. Hot. Hot. This is Arizona. Get a fan. The misters were turned off at sunset. The temp was 100 plus degrees. There is a happy medium., Fans!  They were invented a billion years ago.  We sweat like pigs In a slaughterhouse.  This is a typical Sam Fox restaurant. How do you miss the obvious? The extremely obvious.  The insanely in your face obvious.  Designed by idiots.  It is equivalent of no heat in Chicago. Does anyone have a brain with this dumb chain?"}
{"text":"Why eat here when there's a Cheesecake Factory a few steps away? That's exactly why. Step out of your shell, my little Banana-Republic-Crate-and-Barrel shopper. There's a whole new world of individuality out there.  Even though this joint is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts mega-conglomerate, it is a unique place to try. I've been a few times on visits to Scottsdale and each time I leave with a smile on my face. Good \"California style cuisine\" according to their signage that pleases this Californian.  Mahi tacos: yum! Trout: Delish! Their servers: So this is where the male models work when they aren't in a photo shoot."}
{"text":"Get the potstickers for an appetizer and make sure you go for wine Wednesday when wine is half off a bottle. It's a cute restaurant and I will definitely bring my girlfriends back for Wednesday's. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal. I had the short ribs, outstanding! My hubby had the pork tenderloin which was very good. I really recommend the short ribs. The humus was very good. Beautiful night, beautiful place"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice patio seating. I had the crab & Avacado dip. It was actually really good. The Asian chicken salad was on point too. The service could have been better though. The server didn't introduce himself and forgot what we ordered as well. I'll give this a place a second visit for sure."}
{"text":"What a cute spot!  They accommodated our party of 7 (with reservations) and I felt like we were really well taken care of. Our waiter was great: patient, funny, insightful re: the menu. We stayed for a few hours and didn't feel any pressure to wrap it up and leave, which was nice. I thought the food was interesting, fresh, and delicious. We shared a bunch of apps (warm brie, fondue, calamari) and they were all yummy. For lunc I had the kale salad with salmon and it was really good!  We had the pineapple rum cake (with a candle in it for my friend's birthday) and we all savored a bite or two of that.  I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"In general, I'm not a big fan of the Fox Restaurants but both times I have been to The Greene House, I have been happy with my meal and service.  We had the Kobe sliders, a Grilled Chicken Club with Tavern Ham and Avocado, and a salad.  All of us enjoyed our meals and the service was VERY good in the bar area.  I was very impressed by our server - she was quick and attentive.  Service really makes all the difference for me.  $75 for 4 of us for lunch - a little expensive considering we weren't drinking."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and I love the food! I recently ordered the Asian chicken salad but asked if I can substitute the chicken for another type of meat. The server recommended ahi tuna - the tuna they use on their ahi tuna tacos. I decided to order the ahi tuna and my salad was sooooooo good!!! I also ordered the parmesan truffle fries and they were freaken amazing too. Their black tea was great too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't miss Greenhouse!  The Food and Service are Superior!  We started with the Hummus..... A must have!    Mussels and The Wedge!   Best Mussels I have ever had and the dipping sauce was irresistible !!!  Just ask for Perry....  He will take great care of you!   Bon Appetite  :)"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here...sat at the bar. Food came pretty quick, even though they were pretty busy. The food was VERY good, I had the pea soup which was great, and I had the fresh fish special which was Halibut. It was also very good. Portions are small but I like that, I'll have to come back and check out the wines....the wine list looked good!  It was about 80% women in here...which was also very yummy..."}
{"text":"This place was great! Scottsdale is not my usual stomping ground so I went based on a recomendation and was not dissapointed. I had the beet salad which was delicious and a side of fingerling potatoes. I am very picky about my fingerlings and these were prepared perfectly! My girlfriend and I shared the pineapple upside down cake for dessert and all I can say is YUM! Definately worth the drive..."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight, family of 5 adults, plenty of tables available - however, they asked if we had reservations.  We did not.  They stated - all tables are \"committed\" - we asked were are those that \"committed?\"   Hostess did not have a response.  Unfortunately for Green House a family of 5 adults is an easy $200 dinner bill out.  Shame on mgt for not teaching hostesses the value of business and turning true \"committed\" diners away."}
{"text":"First time to visit The Greene House. Came for lunch. Did not have to wait for a table. At first service was prompt and courteous.  Then it took a long time to get our iced teas. A long wait for our server to come back to take our order. Another long wait for our salads and sandwiches. Food was brought by an expo(runner) and slammed down on our (very slanted) table. Not plated well.  Food tasted great- no doubt. Server didn't check on us. Took a long time to get our check. Runner picked up our used plates again loudly!  It can be a combination of the big and small things that can make a place and your meal memorable.  I would go back but I wouldn't keep it on my list of top 5. Scottsdale (Kierland and the Quarter) have other choices-many of them Fox concepts ... I would recommend those first. I would have to give The Greene House just an \"eh\"."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience with excellent food! Chicken pot pie was perfectly seasoned. The bacon wrapped pork loin served with a scalloped potatoe was so flavorful, I took home leftovers and couldn't wait till the next day!"}
{"text":"Whenever we come to vacation in Scottsdale we have to eat here at least once. This trip we are already on our second time here in 3 days!  The vibe in the Kierland Commons is great. Fun to walk around and shop.   My husband's favorite is the salmon with getting the skin crisped on that fish. For me, it's the citrus beet salad with added scallops and avocado - this is The Best combination of flavors!!!  Their organic green tea is refreshing  - making this a healthy, delicious go to favorite!    The wait staff has always been very friendly and accommodating with my food allergies. We like to sit outside on the patio, but the inside has one whole wall which opens up to the outside which is nice too."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  The only reason it doesn't get a fifth star is how challenging it can be to find parking but everything else about it is great."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts has a dozen restaurants in the valley, and it's no wonder.   They are hard at work, creating inventive ways to serve standard America and Italian fare, and the result is always a culinary adventure.  I dined alone at the bar one night, and had a chance to observe the team work and camraderie that exists between the staff here.  It was a busy time of night, the bartender was juggling the entire bar area by himself, as well as waiting on patrons seated at the cocktail tables.  I noticed the various servers in the dining area helping one another out by helping to serve meals, as well as the manager stepping in to assist the guests and servers.  I had a fantastic margarita, made with pomegranate juice and OJ, a house specialty.  After perusing the menu of classical comfort foods such as the mac and cheese appetzier with andouille sausage, I opted for the brie.  Served at just the right temperature, oozing with cheesy goodness, it came complete with a cherry compote and a heaping of roasted garlic.  Spreading the goods on buttery crostinis, I polished the sizeable appetizer off within minutes.   Although my belly was contented with its meal, I was now eager to explore one of their entrees.  Entrees that the bartender suggested, for someone who likes it all and is always indecisive:  Rainbow trout with fingerling potatoes, baby artichockes, and charred tomatoes Crispy Half Chicken with mascarpone cream corn, and natural jus Grilled ribeye with arugula, avocado, tomato, bleu cheese, and an herb vinaigrette BBQ Pork tenderloin (his personal fave) with mac and cheese and roasted broccoli  I opted for the rainbow trout, a fish that I love and miss from my days in the northwest.  The entree was delivered so quickly, within 5 minutes, that I had to wonder if it had been waiting for me all along.  The filet was so large that I never got half way through my meal.  It was perfectly seasoned, doused in a wine and garlic sauce, topped wtih spinach, artichokes, and charred tomatoes.  For those that are unfamiliar with this fish, it has softer meat and a \"dirtier\" taste.  If you are used to the likes of sea bass and halibut, this $19 entree would not be to your liking.  Towards the end of my meal, I spoke briefly with Danielle, the manager.  I had spotted this woman throughout the night, assisting the servers, bartender, and host - along with speaking to guests and showing them to their tables.  I was so impressed with her devoted participation in the restaurant.  And, well, I had to tell her what a great job everyone did that night, especially the kitchen in preparing my magical dishes.  She talked me into their \"Boca Negra\" cake, the traditional hot molten lava cake, coated in a dreamy caramel sauce and topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  A wonderful end to a delicious night"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been fans of The Greene House since we first visited there about 5 years ago.  Every time we come to Scottsdale, we make a trip there so that we can have the fish & chips.  Without question, they are the best we've had anywhere and I am a bit of a fish & chips fanatic.  Friends of our came in from Chicago this weekend and I told them about the food there, so they just had to try it.  We ordered the fish and chips and the tuna tartare tacos.  Our friends agreed that the fish and chips were the best and the tacos were excellent as well.  They enjoyed it so much that they wanted to stop there on their way to the airport for lunch!  Their reviews say a lot because one of them is a partner in Sunda in Chicago.  Would give them 5 stars, but the service can be inconsistent."}
{"text":"Great food but shitty service after dinner. They close at 9pm and are extremely rude about people hanging around afterwards. How disappointing"}
{"text":"Been here several time.  I like the wine selection it's not overdone but a nice selection.  Wednesday is 1/2 off wine by the bottle which is fun because you can try something that a little more pricey .  Always a good meal too."}
{"text":"We were told about the The Greene House by a friend . It more than lived up to there description. Service was great and the food excellent. We would we definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great place to solo dine or share a meal with your part time lover and full time friend. I wandered in here the first time, while on my way to solo dine elsewhere, and fell in love. It was the menu that got me.  I actually continued on, to my intended destination, then turned back after realizing that the Green House's menu was so much more interesting. I had to try those Tuna Tartar Tacos!  I sat at the bar and had the Tacos, a cheese plate and a bottle of wine, for half off.  The cheese selection was diverse and highlighted some cheeses from California, which I may have passed over otherwise in the market.  I am a fan of the Humboldt Fog, but who knew California could make such a great gooey Brie?! The cheese plate came with fresh dried peaches, cherries and grapes as well as blanched almonds.  Yum!  I thought I would skip right over the fruit, but ended up enjoying it.  I went back again with my boyfriend.  We shared a multitude of appetizers, and loved every one of them   as well as our sweet and cheerful server.  He liked the truffle French fries most of all.  I actually drove 4 hours just to have an excuse to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Best Asian chicken salad in Scottsdale!!!  Super fresh, farm to table taste!!!  Will definitely come back!!  Great menu!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the fondue appetizer. The entrees were good too. Easy to make reservations with Opentable. Will go back with out of town guests."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch here before a design show.  It was the perfect prelude!  It was a warm sunny winter day in AZ and dining alfresco was in order.  We both ordered drinks; I had the Black & Blue Mojito and she had the Fesca.  We shared the White Truffle Paremsan and Chive Fries!  Yummy!   I was warned that my drink was sweet but honestly it paired well with the Turkey on Grilled Flatbread with a side of mixed green salad.  The Turkey sandwich was made with a tasty hummus, avacado and fresh tomatoes.  I like simple, uncomplicated taste - maybe that's why I like the Fox Concept Restaurants so much.  The outdoor patio is great for people watching as well as soaking up the great AZ weather.     I hope to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy our lunch here.    Had to wait for a hostess to even come to the hostess stand to seat us.    The waitress took even longer.   This was on a Thursday at 2:30 in the afternoon.     It's not like it was a busy time.      Ordered the brie appetizer, wedge salad, fish and chips and shortrib.     The wedge was good but  the portion on the fish and chips was way too small.   Very poor quality cod.   My husband thinks he got some type of food poisoning from the short rib.   He was sick all night.    Would definitely not go back.    Also very expensive, not worth the money."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch at 11:30 on a weekday, had the fish and chips. The front desk was a little chaotic, but we were seated relatively quickly and the server promptly came to the table. Service was excellent as was the speed of the kitchen.  The fish and chips were not to my liking. It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough.. The breading was soggy and the fish was mushy. It tasted greasy.  It's a great location for a restaurant and if you find yourself in the shopping center, you  shouldn't feel bad going here. But I wouldn't make this restaurant a destination."}
{"text":"Good food, great service (Ryan) our waiter was super nice.  The black mussels appetizer were delicious and the house salad was excellent! My friend had the kale salad was yummy as well.  Love the Riesling, it was just perfect for my taste.  The negative part was, very noisy and I couldn't even hear when our waiter was explaining for the special menu.  Overall it was great."}
{"text":"One look at the menu and the inviting patio is all it took for me to chose this location for dinner.  The smoked salmon appetizer is excellent and splitting the Cesar salad was perfect before our dinner. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was incredible and perfectly prepared. The potatoes that come with this dish is a must order.  Make sure you leave room for the cinnamon sugar donut dessert.  I will for sure be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Meh.... Nothing to write home about. And with the plethora of restaurants around I likely won't go back to this one again. Crispy Calamari was only good because it was filled with tempura. Otherwise I didn't really even taste the calamari. My Asian chicken salad was mediocre and my drink was weak."}
{"text":"...went there for lunch today. Realy nice menue. Most awesome lunch in a long time. Very nice service as well."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a group for sure. You can get a smaller menu so it keeps it easier for them and you. Everything was delicious and the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The green goddess salad is delicious and simple so it's a great starter for all types of eaters. I got the Nimi ranch skirt steak and it was awesome! Location is good but it's in an out door mall so it's a little congested and you will have to park and walk some. But it's not too bad. Downside is that the bathrooms are outside and they are public so they are not well kept. Other than that everything was awesome"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I hit The Greene House on a Friday night and it was a great place for a casual, but not too casual,  Friday date.  Even though it was Friday we were able to get seated right away. We decided to get a few things to share, that way we could try a couple different items on the menu.   We started with the mac and cheese with sausage. It's kind of like an adult version of macaroni and cheese with a hot dog. The mac and cheese is tasty - very thick cheese. The sausage is a link served on the side, cut in half which was perfect since we were sharing. The sausage had a little kick to it but was not super spicy. A nice compliment to the cheese.  Next we had the twin Kobe burgers with fries. They put it on two plates so I think we got extra fries which was cool. The burger was delicious. So tender and juicy and had that good burger flavor. They are small like a slider so if we hadn't been getting multiple dishes I could have easily eaten both. The fries were good too, thin and crispy with lighten herbs on them.  For desert we had to try the donut. We are both big donut lovers and this one didn't disappoint. It's an oversized sugar donut served with a large donut hole. Definitely big enough to share. On the side is a vanilla and raspberry cream sauce for dipping. It's kind of like a reverse jelly donut. The donut came out warm and soft and was delicious when dipped in the sauce.  A great choice for dessert when you want something a little out of the ordinary but nothing too weird.  My only complaint about Greene House was the noise. It was very loud in there so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The place isn't that big so we were surprised at the noise level. If it hadn't been so hot out we would have sat outside. Oh well, next time.  I would love to go back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is probably the only place that I've been to that I have never complaint or had a bad meal! Everything is great here!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone, and is really lovely. It's fairly pricey, but that's to be expected for its location. Last time I went, I got the salmon salad - it wasn't necessarily what I was expecting. They use butter lettuce which really is delicious, but otherwise it was a piece of salmon on the bed of greens. I suppose it's minimal and healthy, but it didn't warrant the price. There were other really good looking menu items coming out to tables nearby, and the wait staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"Well two for two,  Nice service, exceptional bistro food.  Great day to enjoy outdoor dining in Scottsdale.  Salmon, prepared to perfection. Kobe burger with sautéed onions, crisp thick cut bacon and aged cheddar, YUMM. Caesar and grilled chicken, nice but the attention to detail in the croutons.  Well...You just gotta try em!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot to eat right now. All of the food is delicious, and refreshing in flavor. When you walk in the ambience is very cozy and romantic. I recommend sitting on the patio during a nice evening, because the lights from the outside add to the feel.  For appetizer the warm Brie is the best! It's very comforting food to enjoy on a cool evening. For entrees my top three are the green goddess salad, French dip, and salmon! You will not regret eating here, the only reason I did not give it three stars is because sometimes waiter to customer ratio is off and you may be waiting for awhile when it comes to getting drinks and order taken. Totally worth it though!"}
{"text":"The Greene House is very good. Their atmosphere and outdoor patio is one of the best things about this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday & had the Fresh Pasta & Shrimp - soo good! The only thing my husband didn't like so much was his entree was a somewhat small to medium sized portion for a grown man."}
{"text":"Sent to dinner with 2 vendors from out of state.  We sat outside, covered patio with heaters. We were intermittently hot and cold but it was not too unpleasant.  Food: very very good!!!  Had the braised short ribs, sampled the chicken pot pie and trout. Also very nice Drinks, alcoholic very good.  No dessert  Service was very good.  I would happily go here again.   Great location. Priced accordingly in the KierlandCommons. Free Covered parking garage"}
{"text":"Little bit pricey but the food is really good. Especially the braised short rib. If you like old fashions try theirs it's also tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent salad. Chicken enchiladas not traditional, which I loved not too cheesy. Had lots of veggies. Great flave."}
{"text":"After a nearly eight year hiatus, I returned to Scottsdale for a short trip and my first stop, after baggage claim, the car rental pick up and checking into my hotel, was dinner at The Greene House.    Since it had been so many years, I read some of the more recent reviews and was excited to see that nothing had changed, outside the common theme that the entrees were expensive.  I had a very enjoyable meal, which consisted of a melted brie appetizer, chicken and prosciutto ravioli and an apple tart for dinner.  My entire meal was $35 for three courses, hardly expensive.  A Bentley is expensive, a three course meal at $35, using quality ingredients is a bargain."}
{"text":"Have dined here twice. Once for dinner and the other lunch. Dinner was the first. The service was ok.. Not the friendliest waiter, but not the worst either. The food was good but nothing I would go out of my way to have again. Lunch was better. The tortilla soup is amazing. By far the best I've had in a long time. My salad was good as well. The service was much better. Very nice waiter, polite and very professional. My only criticism is the service was rather slow. It took forever or 2 salads. It was busy, but not enough to justify a 20 minute delay. We had to ask for the check the same time the salads finally arrived. If you have meeting or a scheduled lunch period, I would not suggest this restaurant. But would be great for dinner or a weekend when you have no time frame!"}
{"text":"Not many vegetraian options.  You have to like fish to eat here.  I was surprised at how fish heavy the menu was, especially with a name like Greenhouse.  Food was tasty though."}
{"text":"This place is much busier than Zinc and the waiting area was packed. My wife has been here before and this was my first time. She ordered red wine and I had a Coors lite. I had the fish and chips along with a lettuce wedge salad which was one of the best I've had. It had avocado, hard boiled egg sliced in half, bacon bits and sliced red onion. Yummy, hit the spot. The fish was Rock fish and came with coleslaw, catsup, tartar sauce and French fries. The fish was nicely battered and a slight greasy, not enough to turn you off. My wife ordered the Braised Short Ribs which was tender and packed full of flavor. I'll order that the next time we visit this great restaurant. Our server was polite and knew his menu and was also attentive."}
{"text":"Great as always. We think the menu change is always fun and the service is the best. Our drive is 50 minutes but worth it every time. The Fox Resturant Group has it down concerning what people are looking for in a good meal."}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner here and ordered a variety of dishes. All the food was visually appealing and everyone seemed to enjoy what was ordered. I ordered the Kobe burger, however, I don't think it was actually Kobe. This just tasted like regular hamburger. I've had a number of Kobe burgers at other restaurants, and they have a distinctive taste, unlike this one. Service was good, but I don't remember her offering desserts. Maybe she just wanted to turn the table, don't know?  Overall, I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"In town for some meetings and a little fun. This place is a short walk from the Westin Kierland. We had aa wonderful dinner there. Guided by Mel, one of the best servers we have ever encountered. He patiently walked us through the menu, asked questions about our tastes and then made his top recommendations. All were spot on.  Kale salad. Hands down the best ever Pork tenderloin. Cooked to perfection, large portion And finally this chocolate desert that was amazing. Can't remember what it was called but just ask and they will know.  Looking forward to our next visit next time we are in town"}
{"text":"Asked the waitress about the filet.   She said it was \"ok\", but that I should  try the short ribs as they were outstanding.   I told her I made really good short ribs, so I wasn't sure about ordering those.     She said trust her, their short ribs were amazing and if I didn't love them she would take care of it.    Sure enough, the short ribs were tough, over-seasoned, and simply not near amazing.   When the waitress asked how my meal was, I gave a very blasé \"ok\".    She muttered to herself, hmmm, I guess you didn't like them and walked away.    I maybe can excuse that, as I did say they were \"ok\", but given her prior comments and the fact that my meal was less the half eaten....     Overall, I found the service lacking and food, well, \"ok.\""}
{"text":"As one of the Fox Restaurants, you know quality and price point go hand in hand.  We've been here several times and have yet to be let down.  Something small, yet noteworthy... don't be afraid to ask the chefs for something special.  Something as simple as \"Can you do something to spice up the Mac N Cheese...?\"  And they come back with some siracha-infused bowl of awesomeness...  HELL YEAH!!  Thanks Greene House!!"}
{"text":"Sarah was one of the friendliest and most helpful servers I have come across at any restaurant. She did a great job. Good suggestions and timing.  The food was good, not great. The tempura vegetables with the calamari were good but the calamari was bland and a bit rubbery. The sauce was odd.  The French dip had some good (nice horseradish sauce, au jus was rich and salty) and some meh (the bread was too soft and kind of dissolved in the au jus). Husband enjoyed his tuna tacos.  Drinks were interesting. The sangria was good but didn't taste like a sangria or wine at all. Paloma was fresh and summery but needed more tequila."}
{"text":"We have been in Scottsdale for the past week and ate here twice - both meals (one lunch, one dinner, same menu and prices for each) were great, just spot-on.   I tried a basil gimlet and the salmon bruschetta - both lovely.  Scallops perfectly cooked, and my wife loved her chinese chicken salad. The next time, we had \"pea dumplings\" - wonderful little morsels in a broth we wanted to lick up, and we split both a beet salad and mahi tacos - oh yeah and I had a fantastic pomegranite margarita.  We were tempted to stay all afternoon...  If I am ever back in this neck of the woods, I would look forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"While staying in the area we stopped in here for happy hour.  We got there around 4PM and the place was nearly empty, but within an hour it got packed.  The have a really nice wine menu with most options available in 4 increments from a glass to a bottle, which makes it nice to only buy the portion you might be interested in trying.  They appetizer menu looked really nice so we tried the calamari and the hummus.  Both were outstanding!!  The hummus was out of this world, with fresh cucumbers and feta mixed in and something spicy in it as well.  We really enjoyed this!  Their calamari was unlike any we've had before.  It was tossed lightly in tempura batter, along with carrots, green beans, onions and mushrooms and all of that was fried together.  They all tasted amazing on their own, but the shoyu (Asian sauce) that came with it really added an amazing kick!  Overall, we really enjoyed this place and recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Best pineapple upside down rum cake also their fresh donuts are amazing, good place to go for lunch or dinner everyone is so friendly and food is fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome visit. It was my first time by my wife's second. We already had dinner elsewhere but she insisted we crossed town for their dessert.   We were seated promptly on the patio. It was pretty busy in the dining room. Our mission was to have the chocolate bars of sin.  Even though we were there just for dessert, our sever was excellent and very attentive. We paired the dessert with some Riesling. OMG - wow, loved the dessert and the music coming from the band playing in the open area a short walk away. Total bill was about $16.  I can't wait to come back and try their entrees."}
{"text":"A lovely spot for lunch. The patio is just perfect with the weather cooling off. People watching and fresh air. Our food was fresh and tasty and the service fast and friendly. I can recommend the smoked salmon bruschetta, grilled vegetables and noodles, mac and cheese with Italian sausage and the green tea. After a lovely meal....we had the added bonus of $15 off...received during a dinner at North (the restaurant next door....also very good)....after we realised we were dining at a Fox Concept Restaurant. Lovely lunch spot."}
{"text":"My dinner companions enjoyed the sea bass and pork medallions. The pork medallions were the best meal my companion ever had. I was disappointed with the short ribs. The meat was fork tender and delicious. The entree was drenched in an overly salty sauce. The entree skimped on the cheese grits. I cannot recommend this signature dish."}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to dinner restaurant. They have great food that matches the varied taste of all our family members. I highly recommend adding scallops to the beet salad if you're less hungry, or getting the scallops or the pot roast entrees if you're on the mood for a bigger meal. We also usually get the tempura calamari with veggies, which is perfectly crisp and served with a light sauce."}
{"text":"My go to place when I am at Kierland.  Love the warm brie.  The fresh pasta with shimp may sound innocuous, but don't be fooled it may be the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, I ordered the chicken breast and I dont think it was really that great - the chicken was either undercooked or not a great quality unfortunately. $21 for a low quality dinner with small portion- But the service was excellent. I might come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Server - Sarah  Service - 5 star - Sarah is ON it.  Loved her.  What would we order again -  Crab and Avocado Salad although I hate the jar they put this in.  You lose some of the good stuff on top because the bottom of the jar is wider than the top.  I'm not eating the felled pieces from the table top. Kobe Burger Kale and Roasted Corn Salad  What I wouldn't order again -  Tortilla Soup - It's good.  I'm just not a huge tortilla Soup person.  This is a brothy Soup and I'm more of a creamy Soup person."}
{"text":"We were here on the very busy Valentine's Day - not only was the food incredible, but the service was top notch as well.    My husband got the braised short rib and I got the kale salad and the homemade pasta.  I loved both of my dishes.  The kale salad had a great amish cheddar vinaigrette and the grapefruit slices complimented the salad perfectly.  I also loved the handmade pasta and thought that the simple dressing with melted tomato and spinach was perfect and really highlighted the handmade pasta.    But really the highlight was the impeccable service.  My husband and I were sitting on the patio, which was gorgeous, however, there was a couple next to us who started smoking.  Since I'm nine months pregnant, we decided to wrap up our meal quickly.  I headed inside to wait while my husband asked for our food to be boxed and paid our bill.  Shortly after that the manager approached us, found us an inside table, and offered us dessert on the house.  I'm really impressed that they were so accommodating on one of the busiest days of the year.  Thanks Greene House!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years- with friends, family, this restaurant is great for everyone and is always so so delicious. I have never had a bad experience here! This place is a definite must - great location and even better food & drinks! I recommend the artichoke cheese fondue appetizer and any of the salads- the chicken with tomato purée and creamed corn is to die for. Also any of the desserts especially the doughnuts literally melt in your mouth! 5 stars if I could I would give it more."}
{"text":"We visited The Green House quite bit in the past, however, our last few experiences have really not been up to par. I rarely Yelp something bad unless the experience happens multiple times and that is certainly the case here as well.  Bottom line, this place has gone way down hill. The service the last few visits has been less than great and the food was pretty average. They are quite often out of items on the menu, and the food is bland and unremarkable. Frankly, there are so many other excellent places to eat in the area I doubt we will ever return. The only item with much merit on the menu, in my opinion, in the Beet Salad."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great salads and service is amazing! Wonderful for brunch and lunch with girlfriends!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place during Arizona Restaurant week.  The food was extremely good.  The place is small and gets a bit noisy but the the short ribs make it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent evening here. I had the fish and chips after numerous great reviews and it didn't disappoint (and that's coming from a Brit)! Head Office found a gluten free dish and we had hummus to start, which was also as good as the reviews.  Desert menu was not very interesting at all"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a coworker on a weekday a little after noon. The place was packed! I was also very surprised/glad that we easily found parking. Tables are a little cozy close together but wasn't an issue however it was a little loud.   The service was fast! The server told us this concept is a Asian inspired California cuisine. We started with the Smoked Salmon and Oh. My. God. If you come here, get it! Best thing I've tasted in a while! I got the Asian chicken salad which was phenomenal! Very glad we checked this place out."}
{"text":"I like how \"California\" has become restaurant code for \"portions that are made for actual people, rather than gigantic monsters.\" Everything on our inaugural visit to The Greene House was flavorful and thoughtful, and it didn't make me want to be wheelbarrow'd out of there!  Every time I'm in Kierland I note how this place (like most Fox RCs) is busy and say I need to try it. I'm glad we did, and I can see why it's so popular! The interior is comfy and welcoming and makes you want to just stay a while.   We started with the hummus, which had my favorite mode of transportation for dip-to-mouth: grilled pita. Char marks just make everything taste so much better. The herby feta/tomato topping was a tasty touch. For entrees, I chose the fresh pasta (they had me at \"melted tomatoes\") while boyfriend chose the crispy half chicken. Both plates were a perfect dinner portion and really delicious. The tomatoes, spinach and cheese of my obviously prepared in-house pasta sound basic, but were executed in a sublime way. I know I'm waxing poetic about a simple pasta dish, but I really wish restaurants would understand the \"less is more\" way of operating. Boyfriend said his food was delicious, and I stole a bite of the creamed corn--whoa!!  Since you're not shoved into a food coma here, you get to try dessert! One word: doughnut. Do it. Warm, sugary/cinnamony doughnut (with doughnut hole!), side of two dipping sauces. Oh, those dipping sauces? Some sort of vanilla cream concoction and a strawyberry jam situation. Done. Devoured. MAGIC!  I'm really glad The Greene Room is close to home. It's outstanding!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, despite observing many open tables (both inside and out), we were told it would be a 20 minute wait. We asked about the open tables (ie- were they all reserved????). No answer was provided by either of the two hostesses but we were now advised we could be seated outside right away (odd, right?). Immediately after being seated, we noted that all the patio misters faced outward, misting the sidewalk only. None of the tables on the patio are misted so the patio is absolutely unbearable in the July early evening (7PM). We opted to instead wait at the bar for an interior table. The hostess was advised and could easily see us at the bar as we sat just a few feet away from her, in her clear view. After waiting almost an hour (!!!!!!), all the while noting that most of the tables remained open throughout this time (while the hostesses chatted among themselves), we asked how much longer we would have to wait for a table. The hostess immediately responded \"your table is now ready\". The table she was bringing us to had been open the entire time we waited! WTH?! Then, while heading to the table, I slipped on a wet spot on the floor (spilled water??) and fell, hard, falling first on my knees, then my thigh and finally hit my mouth/head. While falling to the floor, I dropped my martini which shattered, pieces lodging in my leg. For the record, I want to note that I only sipped about 1/4 of my fruity martini during our long bar wait so I was not inebriated nor was I in a state of being unsteady for any reason. The bartender can attest to this as my family and I were chatting throughout our wait. The floor was wet and I went down which has resulted in a very bruised thigh, a bruised/swollen lip with internal cuts, welts on my arm, and three glass cuts on my calf. A man ( the Mgr??? No idea...) came over and helped me up and then proceeded to busy himself with cleaning up the glass. The hostess asked if I was ok, joked that my fall looked like it happened in slow motion, and then she proceeded to sit me down at the table which was covered with glass shards and martini. I told her I thought I was ok (I wasn't...I was dazed to be honest as it was a hard fall to my face). My 21 year old daughter then stepped in and advised that our sitting at a glass shard table was unacceptable and asked that we be moved to another table in a different area. The Manager never introduced himself, never came over to check on me, never asked me what happened, never offered me a band aid/something to clean up the blood on my leg, never asked me to fill out a claim form (to protect the restaurant and have the incident on record), and never even offered to replace the spilled drink. NOTHING. Even worse (if it could get worse), we waited 10 minutes and NO ONE came to our table to service us. The server in the area waited on the two tables on either side but did an excellent job ignoring us. Needless to say, we got up and walked out. I  have never been treated so poorly at any commercial establishment/restaurant in my entire life. Has anyone at this establishment been trained? Their customer service is appalling and the Manager is inept. I am the CFO in the hospitality industry and my company owns/operates 3 restaurants. If this Manager, the hostesses and the server worked on our team, they all would be fired. It has been 5 days since my fall and I am still bruised and I am still in pain. Shame on everyone involved at the Greene House. Your total lack of human compassion is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday for to celebrate a birthday.  We saw and liked the menu and picked this place.  Well, nothing to write home about and no creativity what so ever in any of the foods plus very small portions for the entrees.  My friends had salads which was just okay nothing great about them just average - the Cheescake factory has much better salads and they are located right down the street.  We love Brie, so we ordered the brie appetizer which was just okay nothing wow.  Picazzo's in scottsdale has a much better brie app.  I had the ricotta gnocchi with sweet potatoes which were hard and it was bland, not creative and just basic.  Nothing to rave about at all, the food was just okay not worth the price tag and we will not be going back.  I like food which tastes good, not something with no flavor. .  avoid this place if you want real good food."}
{"text":"Second visit here. This time, we tried the yellowtail sashimi to start and it was super yummy. The ponzu sauce complimented it perfectly. We loved it so much, we forgot to grab a picture.  I'm skeptical when it comes to raw fish of any type but still enjoy a good ahi tuna, Chilean sea bass and shark as well as good sushi. I don't like fishy tasting fish and this was not that. Really good. Texture like a noodle. For entrees, we ordered the braised short ribs and the chicken ravioli. The hubby like the ravioli quite well, I could have passed, but it was good nonetheless. The braised short rib had a buttery flavor and melted right in my mouth. All the veggie pairing were well chosen and the aged cheddar grits were some of the best we've ever had. Yummy!  Will come again."}
{"text":"We've always loved The Greene House and frequented it when we lived in Scottsdale. We've since moved to Southern California but return every year. This year, we were traveling with friends and were excited to take them to some of our favorite spots. Kierland was close to the hotel we were staying at and it's a nice area to walk around. We were traveling with our two young children but came early and since it was a holiday weekend in summer, the restaurant was not crowded.   We were seated quickly. The waiter kindly offered to take our daughters' order and bring bread for them to munch on while we looked over the menu. My three year old started munching on the bread and my husband split a piece of the bread in half for my other daughter. Much to his surprise, there was a rubber band inside! We immediately called the waiter over who apologized, took the bread away, and sent over the manager. The manager explained that they don't make the bread there, he would have a talk with the bakery and apologized profusely.   Our kids' food (mac and cheese) was brought out so quickly that it was before the adults had even had their order taken. I mean, not the most ideal situation, but since everything else had been expedient, we figured it was no big deal. We asked about specials and the waiter joked they had rubber band - which kind of rubbed us the wrong way - and then said there were no specials.   Our kids were done eating within moments. Our food probably took another twenty to thirty minutes. By then, the kids were ready to leave. They're 4 and 3 and so timing the food to come out early is only helpful if the rest of the food is delivered quickly.  The manager had offered to comp desserts to make up for the rubberband bread and we  had accepted. We decided to ask them to box up the desserts so as to get the kids out of the restaurant. He obliged and we headed out.   When we got back to our hotel, and I unpacked the desserts so we could all eat, I realized that not only did he pack any plastic utensils - he packaged up multiple ice cream desserts (IN PHOENIX! IN SUMMERTIME!) for us to take. The packages were covered in melted ice cream and although some of them might have been tasty, we had no way of knowing. The waiter never mentioned that the desserts were cold and perhaps it wasn't the best idea? They didn't offer to comp our drinks or anything else instead. They sent us out with desserts that melted.   It was an unfortunate night and sadly, we won't be returning to The Greene House on any of our trips back to Arizona."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here on Sunday night and was blown away. The service was spot on. Ericka was fantastic. We had a reservation for 830, even though they close at 9, but they still treated us like gold! We have a few allergies and dietary restrictions, and Ericka accommodated ALL of them with ease. She knew the menu inside and out, and never was flustered when we asked for something to be changed. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, each of us had a different entree, and everyone was very satisfied. She even heard us talking about the donuts, and had them sent out to us (with some icecream to go) and took care of it since we were celebrating a Bride to be. We all work in the hotel business and want to steal here away to work for us. If you go, ask for her to wait on you, you will not be disappointed. The restaurant is nicely decorated - we sat on the patio. The wine and cocktail list are fun and unique!"}
{"text":"Cool outdoor patio, good food, great atmosphere, near shopping. Our waitress was great! The short ribs were divine."}
{"text":"I would never write that the food here is \"bad\", but it certainly wasn't anything to remember.  The dishes are a bit overpriced for the quality and quantity of food.  If you are looking for a special night out with great food, I'd direct you to NoRTH, which is directly....South of The Greene House, and also owned by Fox."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Food was spot on with generous portions. Perfect place for a date night or nice dinner out with out being pretentious."}
{"text":"Really great little spot!! It was recommended to us by a friend, and I'm glad we went! The creamed corn is a must order! I ordered the pan roasted sea bass, and I have to be honest it was a bit bland. I had to use table salt, which is rare for me! My husband the French dip and liked it. Service was great! Ambiance great as well."}
{"text":"We went out to the Greene House for dinner.  The skirt steak was phenomenal.  From the the cocktails to the deserts everything was top notch!"}
{"text":"Celebrating my daughter's new job and she always picks Greene House! We love this restaurant. Service is always great, but a little disappointed with my salmon salad tonight. I get this item often and tonight it was dry. :-(. Our waitress was great though and gave me some extra dressing to take with my left overs.  We will still always come back!"}
{"text":"I'm sorely disappointed with our experience tonight at GreenHouse. I've been here many times and have had very pleasant meals. But I won't be going back any time soon. Today was my husband's birthday and we hoped for a typically enjoyable meal. Unfortunately it was a disaster. When we sat down we informed the waitress we needed something to go. Could she please get that going when we were finishing our meal. We ordered and after that it was all downhill. First they ran out of the fish my daughter and I ordered. They said one of us would get what what we ordered. The other would get another fish they grabbed from the kitchen at North. When it came they were both the same and no one could tell us what we were eating. My husband's meal did not come until we were half way through with our meals. And then when it finally came it was raw. And it was pork. He didn't get his food until we were done. When the waitress saw our disgust she said she'd send the manager over. Someone came to deliver my husband's food but never identified himself as a manager and said simply we're sorry. We'll comp the entree. Ok. Then when we were having dessert we reminded the waitress of our to go order. She was a deer in the headlights. She had clearly forgotten to put the order in. We waited about 15 minutes but had to get going. When we asked where the food was the waitress said \"the kitchen's a mess. It will be more than another  15 minutes\". I realize restaurants mess up sometimes but this was one thing after the other. And then the manager, if he really was the manager, should have been  a little more apologetic. Especially when we said it was my husband's birthday. This was very un-Fox like. Their restaurants run pretty professionally. This whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I've left Az for some reason. The ambiance is nice, can be somewhat romantic at night with dim candles lighting up the patio. The waiter we had was very pleasant and just the right amount of checking up on us. The food was fair, but a bit overpriced for smaller portions and selection is limited. Overall I think it's a cute little restaurant with what appears to some pretty healthy and tasty options and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  We searched for a place to eat in Kierland Commons without a reservation at 5:45 on a Friday night.  Two other places couldn't seat us; Greene House was able to accommodate us on the patio when explained that we just wanted appetizers and drinks.  So glad we passed by the other two restaurants.  The service was impeccable.  We all ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup which was delicious and ordered the Tuna Tartare Tacos, and Smoked Salmon.  Expertly prepared.  This is a real winner.  For the quality of food, reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I want to go back!  My friends and I dropped in spontaneously for cocktails. We loved the atmosphere and after reading the description on here, I can completely agree that it is warm and inviting with a seaside appeal to it.   The service was excellent. We were informed that the tables next to the bar were open searing, so we sat at a table next to the bar and the bartender greeted us promptly and took our orders. We tried the wild berry mojito, an old fashioned, and the eighteen dollar margarita (which is only $11).  We all loved our drinks.   Admittedly, I wanted to come here for the margarita because I was specifically looking for a place that makes them without the sweet, syrup-like mix. It was so good that I had two!    At one point I asked if they did take-out and was delighted to know that they did. I ordered the short rib plate to take home and it was absolutely incredible.   Go here. Your tastes buds will be delighted."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! So much attention to detail! Thank you to Mel for taking great care of our daughter and her multiple food allergies!! The ambiance is quaint and sweet. The calamari is out of this world ! The tuna tartare tacos are so flavorful!!!! Loved those! The kids enjoyed their meals!!! The French dip was pretty darn great! Wild go back in a heartbeat! Thank you !!"}
{"text":"I never knew about the Greene House. Been to the Kierland's many of times but never noticed GH. My son heard about this place and had a lot of friends go here. I wasn't to sure about this place, but anyways we came. The outside seems very inviting with all the outdoor seating. When you first walk in BOOM the bar is right there. Very modern looking with an open kitchen. You can see the cooking preparing all the meals. Interesting.   I've read reviews and figured out the fish and chips isn't very good here so marked that one off my list. Didn't try and trust me on this. So I tried the Kobe Burger. Thick juicy huge burger with lettuce, tomato, thick piece of bacon, American Cheese and thousand island dressing. Very tasty. Enjoyed it. Loved the bun too. Very fresh. My wife ordered the Turkey on Grilled Flatbread. It comes with fries or salad and my wife got the salad. She really enjoyed it. She said the turkey was very tasty and had hummus. She put some of her salad in the sandwich and made it really good. Yum yum.   My daughter ordered the grilled Mahi tacos. They only give you two tacos. So it's really not enough. Fish was cooked really good. Very moist and tasty. She really enjoyed it but really wasn't enough to satisfy her. So beware. My son had the meatloaf. It was covered with a sweet BBQ sauce on top of mash potatoes with grilled vegetables. He loved it. Said he really liked the BBQ sauce. Very moist and had a really good taste. Gobbled it up. Do I have to say anything more about the meatloaf.   I would have to say the service was okay. Not great. Took awhile to take our order and get our food out but the food was worth it. I guess you have to be careful what you order here. It could be a hit or miss. We all enjoyed our meal so it was a hit with our family. Only thing is the meals were a little expensive. Around $14 a plate. I understand the cost since it's in the Kierland's. You pay a little higher premium when dining at the Kierland's. Good food and a nice atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal in the Kierland's. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Nicole the manager was awesome! Pork tenderloin was one of the best!!!  I definitely would return when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"It's fresh and light yet super filling. Taste was delicious and much different than previous FOX restaurants I've been to. Brother really enjoyed the pork filet dish? which came decently sized and filled him up. I stuck with a salad that needed a LOT of work on presentation but their garlic truffle fries definitely made up for it. Also...their tacos for appetizer...fat siblings for the win."}
{"text":"Our fave restaurant - pasta , scallops and ravioli rock ! Appetizers- have the tuna tartare tacos , or the hummus . Dessert don't miss the bars of sin Great ambience , friendly folks it's a wonderful place"}
{"text":"Always a good meal here. I have probably been here around 5 times and been able to try new things each time. The crispy chicken, bbq pork tenderloin, sea scallops, short rib and chicken & proscuitto ravioli are all tasty. They each have a very unique flavor to them.   They also have some great appetizers like their smoked brie. My absolute favor thing on their menu is the tuna tartare tacos. They come with 3 tacos and they are excellent! Almost every time I have gone I order them as an app.   The restaurant itself is nice, nothing special, but they do have an area where you can eat outside, which is a nice change."}
{"text":"Excellent Yellowtail appetizer and chicken enchiladas. Great atmosphere and food experience. Service at 12noon was slowed by a large crowd but it's better to be busy than empty at lunchtime. Patience is worth every bite."}
{"text":"It's a good thing that the food here was decent; otherwise this place would have gotten zero stars.  I went here with 3 other people and was told that we'd have a 20 minute wait. After those 20 minutes were up and we still weren't seated, someone told us that the high top tables were first come, first serve, so we decided to sit there instead. BIG MISTAKE! Once we sat down, we were basically ignored and had to flag down our waitress anytime we needed anything. After we ordered our food, it took nearly 45 minutes to get our meal, which, after all of that, was completely wrong. At least one thing on everyone's plate was incorrect, and when we asked what took so long, instead of just apologizing, our waitress AND the manager both had two excuses that made absolutely zero sense. The first one was, \"Well, Scottsdale Quarter is closed\". (It wasn't). And the second one was, \"We were trying to locate french fries\". (I still can't stop wondering what that means, but it was a good thing they did end up \"locating\" them because they are the reason this review gets its 2 stars and they were delicious). Not only did they make up those strange excuses, but they were 0% apologetic for anything and basically refused to acknowledge that they had done anything wrong. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit which I'm sure won't be used."}
{"text":"love the greene house. flavorful california style cuisine, moderately priced. the sandwiches are great with ample portions. the fries are delicious fresh shoestrings.  must try, the chicken tortilla soup...in any weather! it's more filling than it seems.  also the hummus appetizer with flabread...also filling.  the spicey chicken sandwich is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"We have had good experiences here before.....but this time, they would not seat a party of 4 three minutes after closing time.  We went down the street to Zinc Bistro who said no problem.........sure you can dine with us!"}
{"text":"My parents live nearby and like this place so we figured to enjoy the pleasant weather after completing some errands. To that end, we grabbed a bar table next to a large open window and a shortened our wait. Decent atmosphere overall in Greene House, but the food was underwhelming. I wouldn't return.   The calamari disappointed everyone - at least half of the dish was fried vegetables! I'm ok with sweet potatoes and green beans, but not in place of calamari. My burger was overcooked to well done though I'd asked for medium. Additionally, the bun could not hold its own and disintegrated. The fries were decent at least.   My parents liked their soft tacos and salad, the latter of which was tossed without an excessive amount of dressing. That's a plus for any restaurant in a shopping complex."}
{"text":"Recently popped in for a spur-of-the-moment dinner, mostly because it's right around the corner, and happy to have the Greene House as a neighbor!  Love the ambience, and open feel of the restaurant, especially with the open wall to the outside. The great weather this week obviously helped, not sure how comfy that can be in the summer, but we enjoyed the fresh air. And might I mention the people watching - if you like a lot of stretched-tight skin in various places.  Also, I always seem to like a nice restaurant with the open kitchen that seems to be part of the restaurant. All it needs is a screaming Gordon and I'd feel like I'm in Hell's Kitchen. And I mean that in a good way. I love to see the flames of the various dishes being cooked.  Drinks were good, had a perfectly made dirty martini, albeit a little on the small side. For an appetizer, we ordered the warm brie. It came with perfectly toasted bread, sour cherries and garlic. Mixing all 3 onto the bread seemed like the perfect threesome. (Hey, minds out of the gutter please, I'm talking about the brie)  Entrees - I had the chicken and prosciutto ravioli which were delicious, however I would have liked more prosciutto taste and less chicken. Almost had no prosciutto-y flavor. Still loved it, but I do love me some thin italian meat. (geez, will you stop with the snickering?)  The other dishes ordered at our table were the Seared Ahi Tuna which comes on a bed of stir-fry veggies that I was told was mouth watering, and the roast beef sandwich with fontina cheese. I asked my wife how it was, and all I got was a wide eyed nod as if she didn't want to even open her mouth to waste one taste.  And my little one devoured the mac-n-cheese, penne type pasta drenched in melted cheese, topped with parmesan. (also available with grilled andouille sausage).   And kudos to the GH for the meal size. I love a meal where you finish full, but not stuffed. Everything was the perfect size. Service was great with plenty of attention without being annoying. We didn't leave room for dessert, but the warm cinnamon and sugar donut with vanilla custard sounded very tempting. I just wanted to be able to walk out of the restaurant under my own power..."}
{"text":"We have been to The Greene House many times with outstanding service.     But today we took a seat at the bar for a beverage and a light bite.  The bartender (tall male) ignored us for over 10 minutes.  There were other people at the bar but it wasn't full.  Not even a look from the bartender or the bar back that was also behind the bar.    The couple sitting next to us couldn't believe it.  They were trying to get someone's attention along with us.  That couple just shook their heads when we walked out."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Green House today, and sat outside on the perfect day.  The service was very good and the food was fantastic.  We had the ahi tacos for appetizer and they were very good.  I had the fresh pasta and shrimp for lunch and it was fabulous.  The shrimp were jumbo prawns broiled beautifully and the pasta was fresh and delicious.  Others in my party had the Green House Salad and the mahi-mahi fish tacos and they both loved it.  I definitely recommend the Green House for a great lunch."}
{"text":"I have to say I have been to this restaurant many times and I always leave happy.  The food is always good, the staff is always very nice and on point. Tonight the manager came over to the table to let us know our food was just being played and will be on the way shortly, which I thought was incredibly nice. I don't believe any of us felt we had been waiting a long time so that was just a nice \"little extra\" step that I think adds to the experience when going out.    I had the scallops with caramelized cauliflower and bacon it was delicious and just enough. My mom had the meatloaf and she loved it and my dad had the Kobe beef burger and said it was perfect. Our server then recommend dessert and we normally wouldn't do that, but decided to tonight and let me tell you it did not disappoint! We had a  sugar doughnut which they put the doughnut hole on top and serve with 2 dipping sauces 1 is a vanilla bean and cinnamon (I believe) and one is a fruit purée.. This was outstanding! Very light and not oily at all! It was the perfect end to a great dinner."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Last night was our first time at The Greene House. It was a 25% off Labor Day promotion that drew us in. We'd made a reservation requesting outside seating but the hostess \"didn't notice\" that so we waited and additional 10 or 15 minutes. Our server was friendly and enthusiatic about the menu. We ordered The Greene House Salad, Chicken Potstickers, Sea Scallops and the Horseradish Potato Gratin (SALTY but tasty enough). All were good - but not great. We tried the warm cinnamon donut with custard & betrirs6for dessert. That was quite good and maybe worth a return trip but otherwise, we felt there are much better restaurants for the money - especially in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. It didn't help to see the Manager stop at THREE separate tables to issue apologies for unsatisfactory food. We had no problems like that - there was just nothing SO good that made us want to come back. One particular distraction was the music on a tinny sound system. The choice of music really sets the tone of a place for us and we thought a \"California\" influenced theme called for some contemporary Chill music or similar. We likes the songs we heard - they just didn't add to the atmosphere.  We wanted to love it but again, it was just ok. If the prices were slightly lower, it might be worth returning but frankly, North (just around the corner) is the better Fox Concepts Restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"The calamari is fab.  My wife liked her trout dinner a lot?   My fish and chips were very average.  The reason for the two stars is that this large restaurant shares on out door rest room with Restaurant North.  It is way too small for both places and in the 10-15 times I have been there it is filthy, out o.f soap, out of drying paper and usually has paper and trash all over the floor.  After all the years these places have been open I can't  believe this still exists. Sam Fox needs to get .on this.  It is disgusting!"}
{"text":"A solid \"A\". We thought it was great. We (a family of four including 16 and 13 year-old daughters) were in town for spring break in late March and decided to try the Green House as our \"farewell vacation dinner\".  The hostess staff was a little unorganized but after getting seated the waitress (Jamie) was great and the food was outstanding. We had the scallops, bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, beef rib, and the house-made pasta dish. All were outstanding. One member of our party has an allergy to nuts and the staff was more than accommodating - the chef even prepared a special order of warm chiabatta bread that was safe to eat as the regular house bread was made off site.  We would definitely recommend the Greene House and will go there again next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a girls day lunch here and it was Ok. I got a salad and it was alright. My big complaint is that they 1) didn't have a \"kids menu\" - but  the waitress told me what the choices were and 2) the kids meal was more expensive than my own entree salad!! How can you seriously charge $11 for a kids meal?! We've been to really nice, high end restaurants that don't even charge that for kids. The restaurant is loud and you have to walk outside to even get to a restroom (which was dirty, with a long line (only 2 stalls for two restaurants that are connecting to it). I don't think I'll be back to this restaurant in the future. I was really turned off about the lack of kids menu and the crazy price for the kids meal!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl just needs a salad! And when that time comes, I love the salads at The Green House. Situated right amongst the fabulous shops in Kierland, The Green House is perfect lunch spot during a shipping trip. I really loved the wine list too, the Pinot Grigio went perfect with the Kale salad I ordered. The service was super fast and very friendly. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"ate here as i was starting to\"eat healthy\" so i got the grilled chicken breast sandwich and it was actually really good.   we got seated pretty quickly and everyone seemed to enjoy the food they ordered"}
{"text":"Another fabulous Fox Restaurant to check off my list. As noted by a previous reviewer, my thoughts were that The Greene House means a salad/healthy restaurant. Not really the case, but amazingly delicious food, a good lunch splurge. I work close to Kierland and wanted a tasty lunch spot for myself and a few coworkers, one coming in from out of town. Lunchtime parking is a bit of a drag in the area if you don't want valet.  Because it's a Fox Restaurant, I kind of have expectations for service to be on point. It was just a-ok, because it took awhile to be greeted, given drinks and food, and provided the bill. Despite that, we had a wonderful meal. Our threesome ordered the brie as an appetizer, and it was delicious, enough for each of us to have a snack before our salads. Their kale salad was amazing because I added chicken in addition and the mixed dressing wasn't too much [normally I order dressing on the side for all salads]. Probably one of the best salads I've ever eaten in my life. As suggested by our server, we ordered 2 desserts to share - the vanilla panna cotta and the pineapple cake. Loved both, but my hats off to the panna cotta, the red sherbert on top took it over, and getting both on a spoonful was just amazing."}
{"text":"It was really good. I ate the pasta. It was a little on the salty side, but other than that I liked it. It was creamy and the noodles tasted fresh. The service was quick. I like the decor."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Kierland commons for lunch!! It was hard to choose what entree to get because they all sounded delicious. Ordered the seared scallops and they came out perfect. You get 4 large scallops and the vegetables that come with it are super accomodating and fresh."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Service not so much. It was busy however, our server, Mel, needed a personality injection. It doesn't take much to be friendly. Didn't even welcome us or give his name. I had to ask and seemed almost negative to give it to me.   Next time maybe we'll get to sit outside."}
{"text":"We had a nice evening thanks to the accommodating and attentive staff.  Our food was delicious including the scallops (never enough!), the pot pie devoured by hungry hubby (satisfied his big appetite too), guest's fish taco plate with beans he loved, daughter downed her pork loin with potato gratin (nice portion size, enough to stuff), and the horseradish potato gratin I could eat every day, mmmm. We shared a kale salad and it was about as good as it can be, being that it is a kale salad.  Craft beer selection needs a boost, but overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Cute little spot i Scottsdale.  The food is fresh.  The service is pretty good.  It can get crowded pretty easily though.  It's basically a twist on American classics.  The mac and cheese is absolutely delish and the real stand out dish in my mind.  I literally love mac and cheese and could eat it almost every day."}
{"text":"We love this boutique restaurant, just wish there was an Orange County store! Every time we're in Phoenix, we make sure to eat here. Tonight I had the grilled beet salad with a side of wonderful grilled asparagus. Magnifique!! Our server, Lexi was great, too."}
{"text":"Wasn't my favorite fox concept Resturant but it was decent. Really enjoyed the hummus appetizer and the burger was also tasty. Staff was awesome and friendly!!"}
{"text":"The Greene House hit the spot last night- its hard to get hubby to try new places and honestly we've been budget conscious about going out to eat lately, so we really want to make sure we'll go someplace we'll really enjoy. Luckily, hubby liked it, and we were happy with our experience.  I only give this place 4 stars because they aren't kid friendly (a little pricey and no kids' options on the menu), and the service was pretty slow, but even at that, the server was very friendly. We sat out on the patio as the sun was going down- the place had a nice atmosphere and it was just nice to sit, people watch and enjoy the weather. We started with the herbed hummus and I got the twin Kobe burgers with fries- they were pretty decent, nothing out of the ordinary. However, hubby got the mahi tacos and they were outstanding, as was the side of mac cheese we got for my son.   I don't think I'd order the same food, but I would definitely go again for a date night!"}
{"text":"We found this place because it was within walking distance of the Westin Kierland Resort (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-kierland-resort-and-spa-scottsdale) and because it's under the Fox Restaurant umbrella.  By coincidence, we had been thinking about trying Fox's Montana Avenue restaurant when we were in Tuscon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/montana-avenue-tucson), which has an identical menu.  Normally we don't do chains, but we we decided to give this place a try.  We started with the ahi tuna tacos, in part because some of the proceeds when to feed the hungry in Scottsdale.  A tasty choice.  We then split two entrees, the mini Kobi burgers (w/ fries), and the chicken and prosciutto raviolli w/ peppers.  Both were quite good, with the thin cut fries being unexpectedly excellent.  The house margarita and the Zinfandel from Paso Robles were also nice.  Honestly, for what my girlfriend calls \"upscale pub food\", you're not going to get much better."}
{"text":"Went here and we all got Kobe burgers and truffle fries. They were da bomb! Great service and ambiance as well on the patio."}
{"text":"My husband and I love stopping here for lunch or dinner. Every menu item we have had has been delicious! Service is great, and it's right in the middle of some amazing shopping. The perfect day date: shop a little and stop in for lunch! They have healthy options and pricing is on point. Outdoor seating is lovely with the misters on! Dinner can get a little busy especially on weekends, we usually snag a quick seat at the open bar to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"I was at this place for a work party. I would say overall the good was good, and the service was quick. It was hard as a large party at a long straight table and half the party was on a bench and the other half in chairs. This made it difficult for people to get up. Overall its a good place. Its not my normal type of place to go. I am glad I went once, but probably would not return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Delicious food, clean and attractive dining area, friendly staff. Minus one star only for noise level."}
{"text":"Went here in the afternoon one day with my mom for lunch. The place is usually busy every time i've walked by but there is a lot of seating so waiting for a table usually isn't that big of a deal. My mom and I didn't have to wait at all thankfully. We sat outside because it was nice out. The have misters and covered shading for the outside seating so that makes up for the weather part. The service was okay. Our waiter was not great on checking up on us but did check up on us to see if we needed anything. The food was very good though. I got a salad and my mom got a sandwich, both were very good. Besides the somewhat slow service I definitely would come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. The pasta shrimp plate was very good. Would order it again. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant and nice patio. All of our group enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Really friendly waitress who was very attentive. Had the grilled chicken sandwich and chicken pot pie...both beautifully presented and delicious. We sat outside for lunch - great atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! The Scallops are amazing! The other MUST have item on the menu... the Mocha Bars. Oh my goodness, in my top 3 best desserts of ALL time. Their yellowtail sashimi appetizer with avocado, cilantro and jalapeño is also to die for!"}
{"text":"Having lived in California for 15 years I find it funny when a restaurant says it serves California fare. What? Beet salad and seared scallops are only available in California. Warm chocolate cake? Only in the Golden State? Hmmm. Well, what's not funny is how much I enjoyed my food and the attentive and outgoing service we had. And I was delighted at how large the portions were. I was expecting scaled down versions for RW. Kristin S, Rickie and I were here for Arizona Restaurant Week (Ah, c'mon who are we kidding, let's just call it Phoenix Restaurant Week!) and had a fantastic time. My roasted beets were sweet and dee lish. While the sauce with my scallops was a bit too sweet for my tastes, they were cooked perfectly. And as luck would have it, it was half off bottled wines! YAY! Kristin and I sipped a wonderul Sauvignon Blanc that matched my entree perfectly. Rickie's Natural Chicken (WTF? Natural chicken? As oppossed to the chickens with silicon breasts? Now that would be very Californian!) was flavorful but since it was served with the skin on, could have been crispier. Not being a fan of rhubarb I was pretty sure I wouldn't like the cobbler. And. Well. I was right. I made that yucky puckery face you make when you wish you could spit out what you just put in. But I swallowed. Like a lady."}
{"text":"went for an early dinner with my honey on saturday.  we normally don't order apps but we we didn't have lunch so we needed something to get us through. we went with the hummus and pita bread and it was so fresh and yummy! server said that it's homemade in house. For my entree I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and the hubster ordered the crispy chicken and subbed the creamed corn with mashed potatoes, he loved his side of asparagus... smokey flavor.  our server did provide us a lit sample of the creamed corn because he raved how delicious it is. yes the creamed corn was very rich and in my opinion not worth the calories unless you've been good all day.  we both ordered red cabs and we skipped dessert since we were nice and full. enjoyed our meals and the friendly service."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, we were looking for something new and this place looked good online. The atmosphere was ok in keirland commons, the patio was nice, but other than the appetizers the food was meh. I had the kobe burger for lunch, and it was dry and tasteless. My wife had a turkey wrap which wasn't much better. If you want to eat here just order the artichoke fondue and some drinks."}
{"text":"Nice appetizers / drinks had the mussels / napa valley sangria  Entrees could use more variety pork tenderloin/ fresh pasta is good  Desserts were very good - sorbet"}
{"text":"My friend and I have a list of places we want to try and this was on it. We went on a Saturday and had no problem being seated. Our server was great. He helped us with recommendations since it was our first time there. We started off with the Snoqualmie Riesling and it was delish. We then split a salad and a sandwich. The salad was roasted beet and the sandwich was the kobe burger and fries. Both were good and cooked to our specs. I would go again and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I am editing my review. We were there last Wednesday and we had Logan as our server. He did an excellent job and he was so professional and attentive even though it  was packed. As always, our food was delicious.  I always order the hamachi appetizer and the salmon dinner.  It looks like they have made some changes with their hostess stand. Instead of a gaggle of giggling girls playing with their hair, they had one mature efficient hostess with the manager assisting her on occasion. So glad when I see a great restaurant make necessary changes. Can't wait to go back!   I have to tell you that this place almost lost our bi-monthly patronage because of some extremely snotty teenage hostesses.  The first time we thought it was a fluke but tonight was the icing on the cake.  We made a last minute Open Table reservation for a patio table on a Sunday night for 5:45.   We arrived at 5:30 with no wait ahead of us  and at least 2 open patio tables. The 3 young girls at the hostess stand let us know that they could not accommodate our reservation request and they let us know that they left me a voicemail to let me know. My husband asked how long for a patio table. They said emphatically that it would be at least 45 minutes. We said we would go somewhere else and they seemed extremely pleased that they accomplished this. Then as we were walking by the empty tables my husband decided to ask why we couldn't have one of the empty tables. They told him that it was reserved for 7:15!!! They agreed to let us sit at that table.    I will tell you this is the 2nd time we've had an issue with the hostesses. We dine out a lot and the only reason we have come back over and over again after the first \"hostess incidence\" is because the food is extremely consistent. (I love the sashimi appetizer and the salmon, my husband orders the short rib and our son orders the bacon wrapped tenderloin and we always order a bottle of wine off of the reserve list).   That said, we were glad that we battled the teenagers for a table. Our food was good as always and Sarah was an exceptional waitress. Also, we were done before 7 and that was with an appetizer, a salad, 3 entrees and a nice bottle of wine.   I am pleading with the managers as a loyal customer: PLEASE reevaluate who you hire to greet your guests. We have been frequenting your restaurant for years. My husband works with out-of-state clientele as he is always recommending your restaurant to his clients for delicious food and a fabulous atmosphere. We can not in good conscience recommend your restaurant anymore if the teens in charge of seating are playing control games with your customers.   Please hire a new greeting staff that is more mature and more concerned with customer service than they are with styling  their hair (yes-one young lady was combing her hair into a ponytail and one was arranging her flower halo while scolding us about not having a table for us).   We love Sam Fox and his restaurants and we know his restaurants are very good  (my husband is a college U of A friend of his). We know you can do this! Looking forward to upgrading my review after the problem is rectified. Green House-you have nailed it on your food and your waitstaff but please better train your hostesses!"}
{"text":"The truffle fries!!!!!!! I would drive all the way back for these fries. Shared the kale salad with chicken and the 1/2 roasted chicken with the husband. Both meals were incredible. Had a glass of malbec that was :meh: but everything else was wonderful"}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't even give this restaurant 1 star. TONY is the most unpleasant human and I will never step foot in this restaurant again. The way he treated me after a dinner out with my mother and grandmother was just appalling. He stormed to our table after I took a sip of my mothers wine (mind you I am 22 years old) and grabbed the glass of wine out of my grandmothers hand very aggressively. After that he refused to tell me his name and tried kicking me out. Since I was 15 I have worked in the restaurant industry and have never in my life experienced such a disgusting and unpleasant experience. DO NOT GO ESPECIALLY WITH TONY AROUND. On a somewhat positive note, the general manager was pleasant and helped the situation. To be honest I am just mortified with my experience and will never be returning."}
{"text":"Overall this made for a great place for Valentines! A week later and my husband is still saying \"that steak was so amazing!\" The filet truly was divine. Literally melted in your mouth! The rainbow carrots along with it were cooked to perfection with an incredible sauce. I myself had the bacon wrapped tenderloin which was equally as delicious, I just had entree envy and really wanted the steak!! The sides did leave a little to be desired. The mac & cheese was really plain and it kind of seemed like they just mixed noodles into fake cheese like valveeta. Not my favorite. The dessert completely made up for it though! Their chocolate mocha dessert was out of this world!! I would return for that dessert alone! Chocolate mouse on a bed of chocolatey hazelnut? Just too good to be true!!  Fantastic service! Our server was super wonderful and kind, made us feel welcome and important. I wish I could remember her name!  The ambience was fun and fresh!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but overpriced for what it is. You can for sure find better in the Kierland and Scottsdale area. Especially at that price point.  Herb Box for example in Old Town."}
{"text":"I think the Greene House might be my favorite restaurant in the Kierland/Scottsdale Quarter areas. I've dined here a few times or picked up food to go at least every other week. The food is consistently great and service is attentive and friendly.   The Greene House has great mussels, kale salad, sea bass, chicken pot pie, calamari, scallops, and salmon. The panna cotta is a very nice, rich and creamy homage to strawberry shortcake with the garnishes. (You should definitely save room for dessert here!) The drinks are also nicely done - I loved the pineapple mule and the fig mule.   I don't think you can go wrong with a meal at the Greene House - it's nice for dates or for work. The only downside is that there are maybe 2-3 vegetarian options on the menu and I don't think there is anything for vegans - this is the only thing keeping me from coming in more since a lot of my group has some vegan/vegetarian restrictions."}
{"text":"Meh.... I had high expectations for this joint and it sadly didn't cut the mustard.    The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our party, who had changed the reservation size twice and showed up late (oops!  we accidentally went to the Scottsdale Quarter).  My party enjoyed the prix-fixe meals for Restaurant Week.  The appetizers were certainly the highlight here-- baked brie, hummus, and calamari.  Each was tasty, had a unique twist:  the brie was accompanied with garlic and cherries and the hummus was topped with tomatoes, feta, and cucumbers.   The dinner portions were small and sufficient. I personally like salt, so the salty scallop dish didn't bother me.  However, another diner in our group took issues with the overly salty dish.  The chocolate cake was not worth the calories.    I'm a HUGE Fox Concept restaurant fan, but Greene House didn't do it for me.  Go next door (literally) to North or to the Scottsdale Quarter to True Food Kitchen for a better Fox dining experience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being taken here, Mother's Day, and from the greeting at the entrance to the farewell at our conclusion, it was apparent, the Greene House follows the protocols of hospitality.     The restaurant is very aesthetic and the staff, exceptional.  Our waiter was professional and I cannot emphasize enough, enthusiasm and being part of a positive experience makes anything that follows exemplary.  The food from appetizers to desert, was fantastic.  Subtle and complimented flavors, well prepared and, in the case of the pasta dish I enjoyed, enough to share.    A great occasion, experience and memory."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and vast menu (multiple delicious options - picking one dish won't be easy) with Californian inspiration.   Kale Salad and donut dessert - don't miss out on these!"}
{"text":"They were very accommodative with our family and found a space for us and our three year old that worked great. Our server Jessica was amazing and food was awesome. Happy to recommend as a date night or even with a family."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, had a great dinner on Wednesday. Went in for a glass of wine and dinner and found out they have half off bottles on Wednesdays. Ended up getting a bottle and their half chicken entree and it was awesome! I say surprisingly because in general, I have generally underwhelmed with Fox Concept restaurants, but this along with North have consistently surprised me. I'll definitely be making another trip here."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The hummus appetizer was excellent. The entree was great as well. They were more than willing to accommodate some amendments I wanted on the entree. The bartender was fast and friendly. The place itself was very modern and clean."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at the reviews here. This place is fantastic. A great location. Awesome food.   I've eaten half the menu and everything except the gnocchi has been way above average.   The herb hummus appetizer is great, too."}
{"text":"This is a local favorite.   Service was exceptional, but the menu feels stale.  Had the kobe beget which was excellent.   The calamari was a little on the great side, but the avocado and cream dip looked delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch recently and had a great experience! Salads were fresh, hot bread served, and service was very good! Another Sam Fox restaurant that didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly - it's definitely one of our 'go to' spots in the neighborhood.  The service and food are always consistent and the drinks are particularly good.  If you like a mule, their fig mule is really tasty and served in a copper cup - so it stays super cold until you finish it (as a mule should).  We consistently order the kale salad to start.  it's exceptional.  sometimes I just order it as a main course - it's that good.  For main dishes, we really like the trout and short ribs.  my husband loves their chicken pot pie... but it's BIG and you need to be hungry.  we rarely get dessert since their food is satisfying - but we did have gelato last time that was really great.  Overall... it's just always great.  patio is great seating and the bar is even nice if you're popping in and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I love most Fox restaurants but I think this one is my favorite of all.  We had good options of wine and cocktails but I was so impressed with the appetizer options I made them my meal.  We shared calimari which was incredibly tasty.  I had tuna tartar tacos for dinner and they were the best possible and I have tuna tartare a lot.  My friends all had a wedge salad and added scallops which was a nice option and the tortilla chicken soup was fabulous.  Absolutely fabulous meal all around finished with an fun donut and custard type dessert we all shared."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Always consistently good food and service. Have a good variety of menu options as well as appetizers and desserts. Staff is always friendly and helpful and willing to give suggestions. This is a fox concept so you kind of know what to expect. They also do a happy hour. If you're in the area and hungry or thirsty definitely come by and check out this spot. Lots of restaurant choices right in the immediate area as well."}
{"text":"This review is for our dining experience on 2/18/17.  I typically do not write reviews unless I have a great experience or a poor one.  This review is the latter.       My wife and I and our two friends made reservations ate the Greene House to celebrate our belated birthdays and our friend's new job.  We made reservations for 6:45p and arrived at the restaurant at 650p.  The hostess informed us that our table was not ready as the previous party was still sitting and talking at said table.  While waiting we had a drink at the bar, pinot noir and their version of the Moscow mule which was very well done.  We waited for approximately 25 mins for them to clear out and clean the table off before being seated at 715p.  Now, I understand it was a busy night and don't expect to be seated right when we walk in the door but a half-hour wait with a reservation is pushing it.     Once seated our waitress arrived promptly, however, she never introduced herself, so I couldn't tell you what her name was.  Everyone at the table had already had their drinks from our wait at the bar, but I ordered an Orange avenue beer that took about 15 minutes to arrive.  We then started off with several appetizers that arrived promptly.  First, we ordered the Yellowtail sashimi and the Tuna Tartare Tacos, both of which were excellent and very flavorful.  We then had the mussels and the calamari.  The mussels were served with grilled ciabatta and their house chorizo and were very tasty as well.  The mussels were also a very large portion and good for sharing.  The calamari was also a good portion size and very good as well.       During our second round of appetizers, were put in for our dinner orders.  My wife ordered the the Mahi-Mahi tacos, I had the Fish and Chips, and our friends had the Braised short ribs and Sea Scallops.  The Mahi-Mahi tacos were very soggy and the white bean salad was served luke-warm.  I had the fish and chips which came with three large pieces of fish and crispy fries.  The fish was flaky and meaty and very tasty.  Our friends both enjoyed their meals as well.  The short rib was very tender and the scallops were seared very nicely.  We also ordered Truffle fries and the Marscapone cream corn to share.  The fries had a good flavor and were very crispy, however, the creamed corn was very mushy and a miss.     Towards the end of our meal, our two friends were still finishing their meals and our waitress came back two times within 15 minutes asking us if we wanted to go boxes  We found it to be rather irritating that we were sat down late and then felt as though we were being rushed out.     And to top off our lackluster experience here, this morning two out of the four of us have felt ill with stomach flu-like symptoms.  Not sure if this was related to the raw fish from the sashimi and the tartare tacos we all had or not but it really caps off an overall poor dining experience, which is a shame because we had great experiences at several other Fox Concepts such as North and The Henry.  Needless to say, I would recommend skipping The Greene House and going to on of the other fine eateries within Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for lunch without looking up any reviews because we were starving. We did not know what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised! We ordered the hummus and the pot-stickers for appetizers. Both were extremely tasty and the pot-stickers come out in a cast iron skillet and are piping hot. Some of us got wedge salads that were extremely tasty and had a very good presentation. The Asian salad was my favorite - light and tasty. My family also said really good things about the chicken club and the turkey on grilled flat bread.  Overall, it was a really good experience and I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale to try round two!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Greene House twice and really do love the atmosphere of this restaurant. That wasn't unexpected for me though as it's a Fox Restaurant and those folks have the game on LOCK!   The Greene House is cozy, bright, well-decorated, and airy- very \"West Coast\". I love it.  One my 1st visit I had the fresh pasta (it comes with spinach, tomato, and parm) and although I had high hopes, I was a little disappointed. The pasta wasn't al dente and was actually somewhat mushy and overcooked. Also it was skimpy on the cheese and that is a cardinal sin in my world. For me, cheese = life.  On my 2nd visit I had the roasted sea bass with potato puree, spinach, broccoli, onion, and lemon vinaigrette. It was absolutely delicious but HOLY TINY PORTION SIZE BATMAN. This itsy bitsy ass portion of sea bass cost $25? Very, very disappointing. I most definitely did not get my money's worth. For about $5 more I could go to Pappadeaux's and get twice this amount of sea bass. And it tastes just as good TBH.  Also, I have to remark that my food came out cold on both visits. That's a huge pet peeve of mine. I will give Greene House a 3rd chance though- the pineapple mango mule drink is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love The Greene House. Especially the Sunday special with half off bottles of wine!  The fish + chips is to die for. So so good.  And, just about every single appetizer on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is unexpectedly great!! I had the braised beef short ribs with cheese grits. Incredible!!! The wait staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. We had a large group and everyone loved their food. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled across the Greene House while Yelping the other night. We couldn't figure out where to go for the night, so while browsing we came across this place and the decent reviews led us to go ahead and give it a shot.   It was a chilly Arizona winter night... but indoor seating was full, so we opted to sit out on their heated patio. When they say 'heated' patio, they aren't kidding... it was toasty out there! In fact the first table we got seated at was so hot we had to move, we were getting a little sweaty after just a few minutes and it was probably in the low 50's outside... so yeah; they have some pretty powerful heaters. Once we moved tables, it was quite relaxing and chill... this place just has a real nice relaxing vibe to it. That, and you can people watch all the yuppies shopping at Kierland as you eat, which is always fun.   We decided on the twin Kobe Burgers (with white truffle and rosemary fries) and the BBQ Pork Tenderloin. While we waited they brought some bread that was pretty tasty. The twin Kobe Burgers came and looked oh so good. The first bite into those things was like heaven in a bun... literally melt in your mouth good. Juicy and flavorful, and they went perfect with the crunchy fries. The Tenderloin was equally yummy... great sauce and crispy around the edges but soft inside; perfectly cooked in my opinion.   Our waiter was also great... very attentive and polite while not being too overbearing. All in all it was a great meal, and I can't wait to go back to this place. 4.5/5."}
{"text":"We attended the New Years festivities so the menu was limited. Even so, Ribeye cap and lamb shank were delicious. Lily was very good and attentive, as was the managerial staff. Look forward to trying this place not during the holidays, particularly for lunch."}
{"text":"My family LOVES Fox Concept restaurants. My dad specifically wanted to try a Fox restaurant we hadn't visited before, and this was close to us at the time, so we visited The Greene House.  The atmosphere here is fresh and pretty -- somewhere I imagine getting lunch with a small group of friends after some light shopping, though my family went for dinner. But I think my expectations for the food were too high. I ordered the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin because I'm a sucker for both bacon and brussel sprouts, which were both in the description, but was sorely disappointed. The bacon/pork tenderloin were extremely flavorless and lacked any decent texture. The brussel sprouts were pulled apart and used as a garnish. My favorite part of the meal ended up being the potatoes underneath.  Three stars because service was decent and the fondue appetizer was pretty good, but especially for the price point, I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I loved this place! California inspired at its best.  I had the black mussels and warm brie for appetizer.  I loved the mussels! Super tasty and the chorizo added a nice touch.  Mouth watering as I'm writing.  The brie was ok.  Not that special.  I ordered ginger margarita but had to send it back.  Quite bitter and not to my liking.  Instead I swapped it out for the Pomegranate Martini. Yum! For entree, I had the Sea Scallops.  The sauce was sweet and went great with the carmalized cauliflower.  I am definitely going to come back to this place.  There is so much more to try!"}
{"text":"I wanted a light lunch before a meeting.  I was solo.  So I drove into the Kierland Commons shopping center and randomly picked The Greene House.  I sat at the bar and had iced tea along with a grilled chicken breast sandwich.  I chatted with the bartender and people watched.    It was a very pleasant lunch in an upscale environment."}
{"text":"Update:  I went back for dinner and was equally impressed.  I had fish with some sort of sweet glaze and sauteed mushrooms.  It was out of this world.  Really really good.  I splurged and went for dessert as well.  Oh my god, everything was perfect.  Service was excellent.  Fox hit this one out of the park.    ------------------------  I had the most fantastic lunch at Green House, which just opened a few weeks ago in the Kierland Commons outdoor shopping plaza.  Oh so California, from the wine list and Cow Girl Creamery cheeses, to the fresh seasonal dishes gracing the menu.  Elegant modern casual breezy restaurant that really feels like it was plucked right out of the Bay Area.  The decor seemed one part California craftsman and one part Frank Lloyd Wright.   I totally splurged and had the Kobe beef burgers since I was dining solo.  Yes, the plural is not a typo.  The presentation is two mini burgers, aka sliders, with a square dish full of fries.  I opted for a salad of tossed greens instead of fries to assuage my guilt.  I washed it all down with not one but two delightful glasses of red.    I chatted up a mystery stranger at the bar, imparting some shopping advice (he was looking for that perfect Valentine gift for his lady), and he quite chivalrously paid for my lunch!!  Hip hip hooray for random acts of kindness.  The bartenders were super nice.  Overall, one of my top lunches ever."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends here on a Friday night. Place was busy, but it didn't stop our server from being plenty attentive. She was also helpful on a few menu questions and suggestions. They also have a really good ambiance both inside and on the patio (which is where we sat).  The food was good, but I'm just not sold that it's so good/unique/original that it warrants the price that comes with it. While I clearly anticipate the more upscale price tag that comes with anything in the Kierland/Scottsdale Quarter area, it just didn't jump out as 'totally worth it' to me.  My personal opinions aside, their food and service were both plenty good and overall it was a positive experience. No objections to going back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for some classic american cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped at Greene House for late lunch while shopping at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale. Menu is California Focused, with an asian fusion influence. My favorite part about this menu was the variety of appetizers. I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Tuna Tartare Tacos (so good!). Service could have been better, our waitress seemed irritated to be working there. Perhaps she was hangry? Would absolutely visit here again and try the salads and other entree options. Appreciated a light menu in a pretty environment in the middle of the mall. If service was a bit better, this would have been a 4-Star spot."}
{"text":"Smaller restaurant but great atmosphere. Went there for my family birthday and we loved the sea bass and short ribs plate! The food was delicious!!"}
