{"text":"I have loved all of the donuts that I've had the opportunity to try at Joe's. Maple Bacon and Chocolate Bacon were both on point; I was worried that they wouldn't live up to the hype, but they totally did. The Vanilla with sprinkles was on point as well. What I think was the gluten free blueberry flavor was also quite yummy; I would not have known that it was gluten free if they hadn't told me. I can't wait for the storefront to open. It's on my way to work, so that's going to be dangerous."}
{"text":"I cannot express how excited I have been to have such a great donut shop in walking distance from my apartment. Throughout their pop-up shop days it was difficult to get my hands on their donuts as they were always sold out, but now they're here!!! I've tried 8 flavors and my two favorites are the Everything and the Chocolate Espresso Cake donuts. The Everything has all the toppings of an everything bagel, but sprinkled over a thin layer of vanilla glaze. If you've never tried a savory donut, this one is a game changer.

They had some issues with keeping up with production when they first opened, but I've seen nothing but improvements in this area. Even when I hit at 8 am rush hour, there's a full selection and quick service. 

Great people, great donuts. Glad you guys are here!!!!"}
{"text":"I love gourmet doughnuts! My only complaint is the greasiness. It made the bottom of the doughnut almost soggy. Flavor was great otherwise. Maybe I just didn't get a fresh batch."}
{"text":"Today was my very first experience with Joe's and trust me when I say it WILL NOT be the last.  I was pleasantly surprised by a co-worker this morning who brought in a pizza box full of several different doughnuts and I went the safe route.  I tried the Vanilla one and wow.  I said this is amazing where in the world did you get this?  He sat and told me all about this Joe's place and the story.  We all sat around eating these talking about how good they were and how great it is we have this place nearby.  It got me wondering if they had any options for my daughter who has a laundry list of food allergies.  I checked out the website to see they had vegan and gluten free. I decided to email them and explain what allergies she had to see if it would even be possible.  Trust me this is a regular thing for me...many places act as if I am high maintenance or don't really care.  I have to say within 45 min the owner had responded with a personal message including others from the bakery (GM and baker included) to see what they had available that might work.  This means so much as I know they are busy getting this dream off the ground and keeping up with demand of great doughnuts daily.  I am so thankful for finding these guys and will support them going forward with lots of recommendations!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place after hearing such great things, I even made a special trip to get all the way to NoDa to try. It wasn't quite what I had hoped for. 

We arrived around 8am, there were only four flavors of donuts left. All of the flavors I had hoped to try were sold out. It was between vanilla, Smores, lemon, and a single everything donut. I asked how long for the other flavors - 25 minutes - crap I have other things to do. Smores, vanilla, and lemon with two coffees it is. 

Service and coffee were both great. Love that they provide almond milk to put in the coffee. 

The vanilla was delicious. The flavor was amazing. I felt the Smores was a little over powering but the frosting was still really good and I liked the marshmallow filling. I also enjoyed the lemon. I thought the bread was good despite some other reviews, but they were a little cold - I could only imagine how they would've tasted warm and fresh from the oven. 

It was a so-so experience for me. They have some good ideas, but need to work out kinks (basically with supply/warmth of donuts) I would love to try again, but will probably let them catch their footing first. I wouldn't want to arrive again without being able to try some of their other flavors!"}
{"text":"The donuts at Joe's were AWESOME!!! Especially because they were gf, vegan and completely safe for me. Unfortunately, I have a ton of food allergies and the owner, Joe, supplied me with all ingredients and the young lady that helped me check out was more than happy to put on clean gloves. Try the gf with the strawberry topping- so good!!! Thanks, Joe's Doughs!"}
{"text":"Sea Salted Chocolate Caramel.  Outstanding.  Light, just right.  If you haven't been to Joe's you need to check it out."}
{"text":"Although we arrived about an hour before they closed, it was my first time trying out this awesome little spot and the doughnuts were sub par. They were also pretty cold and dry. Ill probably return to duck doughnuts next time"}
{"text":"I love every donut that I have tried! Joe's Doughs always brings the perfect amount of creativity but doesn't overdo it. There is usually some more standard options (cinnamon sugar minis, almond glazed, chocolate glazed minis, etc.) along with a number of adventurous flavors like chicken and waffles, red velvet cookies and cream, and blueberry french toast, just to name a few. My personal favorite has been the peanut butter s'mores! You can't go wrong with any donut you try. 

Currently Joe's Doughs has been operating as a pop up shop at The Daily Press in Noda. Cash and cards excepted. Get there early because they WILL sell out!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love these donuts. The flavors sounded amazing and interesting and the pictures were fun. Taste wise - the donuts just weren't there. We split them up for our team this morning so that they could mix and match. The consensus was resounding disappointment with all but the PB&J donut (which was pretty awesome). Some of the donuts were even quietly spit out (e.g. the everything donut). We'll be going back to Duck Donuts next time."}
{"text":"Cute space, friendly staff, interesting flavors... But I just wasn't impressed with the doughnut itself. Underneath all that frosting is a bland, boring, stale doughnut that left an unpleasant film on my lips an hour later. 
All of the flavors I wanted to try were not available on a Sunday morning at 8am - goat cheese strawberry balsamic, coconut banana caramel, and PB&J. Instead I had a bite of the vanilla, everything, and candied lemon, but I didn't want more than a bite because of the texture of the donut itself. I don't think I'll be coming back to try those other flavors, this place just doesn't stand a chance against a hot, fresh Duck Donut or Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"Awesome one of a kind donuts. Get there early for best selection. My fav maple and bacon"}
{"text":"Joe's doughs is great, do not get me wrong- but, it still does not come close to the flavors and dough made by Your Moms Donuts in Matthews. I don't taste much difference eating these doughnuts than I would eating a doughnut from Krispy Kreme or Dunkin."}
{"text":"OK, I was a bit skeptical but now I am a believer!  

The first time I went to the pop-up shop at Pure Pizza on Saturday morning I wasn't that impressed. They were about half an hour late showing up and the line was very long.  I guess after waiting 45 minutes in line I was a little bit grumpy.

The next week I went to their Saturday morning gig at The Daily Press in NODA.  I was glad I did!  The Hot Chocolate donut topped with flamed marshmallow was great!  The Eggnog French toast was amazing!  Banana Cake with caramel was sublime. Panthers special donut was awesome. They are really works or art and delicious!

Can't wait for them to have a permanent home in Noda next spring!"}
{"text":"I would appreciate it if they would be open during the hours posted on their website. I drove 20 mins out of my way to try the doughnuts here, got here at 8:30am and they are closed when their website says they are open at 7am on Sunday. Also, you need to change your voicemail too regarding business hours."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST donuts I have ever had.  Very creative, delicious, and the people working there could not be nicer!   GO CHECK THEM OUT, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This edition of Exciting about Eating takes us to Joe's Doughs, a small family bakery making hand crafted artisan donuts in the NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte.

Dora here. I rarely like to go out for breakfast because why pay for cereal? But it was Ernie's birthday, and he enjoys breakfast out. So there you have it.:)

This doughnut place is not like most, where they have the same types of doughnuts every day. Joe's Doughs offers a limited variety and the selection changes every 45 minutes or so, so you're guaranteed a fresh bite.

Dora here. Because I'd scoped out the menu beforehand, I expected to drool over Espresso Cake and Candied Lemon, but they weren't there! OH NO! That's okay. My initial disappointment didn't last long. lol.

In order to get a true taste, we chose 4 different selections and shared. Dora here. Yep, straight down the middle. No cheating.

The Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel doughnut was outstanding, a yeast doughnut that was sweet and salty, but I could not pick up the chocolate. Dora here. I have to disagree with hubby here. This doughnut was my least favorite because the chocolate and caramel flavors were so light, I couldn't taste either over the salt. Not that I left any of my half, mind you. haha

The PB&J was  great, but everything is always better with peanut butter. This yeast doughnut was primed with strawberry filling and covered with creamy peanut butter. If you closed your eyes, you would think that you were eating a PB&J sandwich. Dora here. The PB&J was another surprise, mainly because I'm not a huge PB fan. But it wasn't overly heavy on the PB taste and the thick strawberry jam filling oozed out. The texture was such that we couldn't decide whether the doughnut was yeast or cake. A staff member verified that it was indeed yeast.

The Goat Cheese Strawberry Balsamic, although good, was my least favorite. It was also a yeast doughnut covered in goat cheese and drizzled with strawberry and balsamic. The doughnut was really fruity and only had a hint of cheese. Dora here. My second fave -- surprise, surprise -was the Goat Cheese Strawberry Balsamic. I so wasn't expecting that. Sweet, but not sugary. Light and delish!

The final selection was the Coconut Banana Caramel Cake. Outstanding! It was the only cake doughnut we tried and it did not disappoint, full of favor and almost tasted like a piece of cake. Dora here. My favorite was the Banana Coconut Caramel Cake, and it represented its name well. The only cake doughnut here, it reminded me of a thick, generous slice of banana bread. Yum! 

Overall the doughnuts were not as I expected, in a good way. You know how you dread that heavy, bloated feeling or the sugar rush that comes from eating doughnuts? That didn't happen. Maybe because we snacked on a few cheese curds before we left home? If they upped their number of selections and offered more coffee choices (like lattes), I might be convinced to go out for breakfast more often. Oh, you might want to check out their Instagram photos, but be prepared to drool. Don't say I didn't warn you.:) ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"The cinnamon sugar doughnut is absolute heaven!!!! I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"I just happened to drive by on my way to Salud, when I saw the sign and wondered if it was a donut shop! So happy I stopped! The donuts were top notch, the bacon maple donut was fantastic as they have some sticky droppings of maple syrup over the bacon on top! Delicious! I also loved that they used rainbow sprinkles too! And they don't skimp on the sprinkles! I ended up buying 6 to go with a small milk because they were so good! If you like donuts, you cannot miss this stop!"}
{"text":"I had visited Joes at pop up shops around the city before they opened their store front.  They introduced me to maple bacon doughnuts, not something I would've otherwise tried, but that morning, there was really no other choice, and after waiting in line for 30 minutes, I thought I'd give it a try. I was hooked! I went back to their store front a few days ago, and they had plenty of doughnuts, and it was surprisingly quiet. The girl at the counter was very friendly and the doughnuts I purchased were amazing! Tasted great to no surprise of mine! I'm not sure why everyone else has given this place negative reviews, but they must not know a good doughnut when they taste one. You want a good doughnut? Go here!"}
{"text":"First time going to Joe's Doughs and I live on the east side of Charlotte and it was well worth the short ride.  Doughnuts were amazing!!!  I got one of each flavor. Big and fluffy.  I am definitely going to come back for more and I recommend anyone to try them out too.  


Omg just went back... how do you guys make them so fluffy and delicious.  I had the strawberry lime coconut...Amazing!!!!!!!! So good. The best doughnuts in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Never tried or had a \"fancy\" doughnut before and thought they were all just the same, but in the wisdom of Clay Davis SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIT i was wrong

These were amazing!  That maple bacon will smack your taste buds straight off to Canada whilst singing America The Beautiful

Great owners and awesome staff can wait to drop by and change up morning breakfast!"}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this place!! I don't typically like chocolate and I got the chocolate donut and it was AMAZING! Wow!!! It completely MADE my husbands birthday!"}
{"text":"How awesome is this place? The definition of eating local.

Bring your appetite. These bad boys are HUGE. They're about twice the size of your normal doughnut. We got a half dozen. To my surprise, the PB&J was my favorite. They are totally welcoming and interactive with the client base. To see them start from scratch, go through the growing pains of starting a new business in an area that certainly isn't cheap to operate in, and  to do it all with smiles on their faces is one of the reasons Charlotte is great. 

Also, Joey, you WOULD put up a donut shop next to a video game bar, haha."}
{"text":"Yucky donut! $2 for 1 gross cold donut.

Won't ever be back! Spit it out, completely disgusting.

 

I would highly recommend the drive to duck donuts. Cheaper and incredible melt in your mouth goodness. You also have a wide selection of choices made fresh."}
{"text":"Creative flavors and tasty at that. They are pretty no frills though coffee and donuts and a small cooler for water and juice. So far every flavor we have tried had been very good. Maybe bacon donut was really good and it's been a go to for me.They are definitely making s good product in an up and coming area of charlotte stop in have a donut and then go drink a beer at one of the local breweries better yet bring donuts to the breweries and make friend and share your donuts maybe you will get a free beer."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are fantastic! Maple bacon is my favorite and the vanilla with sprinkles is a close runner up. Also, Jaclyn is fantastic and such a joy to be around!!! Can't wait for the store front to open!"}
{"text":"Have heard all this talk about joe doughs finally got the chance to go today. Not busy on a Saturday morning and the girls were in there making the doughnuts. If your in the area this place is a must go.  I wouldn't drive all the way up from Steele creek area to noda to get them due to price. Only had 2 doughnuts I couldn't get at Krispy Kreme. This place is know for there interesting doughnuts and maybe I went on a bad weekend but in all they were very good soft doughnuts. I got a salted Carmel and the rice Krispy doughnut. Very good and soft."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Joe's Doughs for dessert tonight.  The atmosphere was great. Open kitchen full of doughnuts and toppings... Friendly staff... Outdoor seating...  Doughnut display... AND according to their sign the doughnut menu changes every 45-60 minutes! (We weren't there long enough to see the next menu.)  We tried the more common doughnuts this time - chocolate with sprinkles and vanilla with chocolate chips - and were very happy.  It was my son's 4th birthday and they even made him a special donut with the number 4 in m&m's!  Next time we'll try the salted caramel or even the pb&j!"}
{"text":"Let me just keep it real... the joy I get walking into work and seeing donuts is like none other. 

Especially on a Friday! 

So I was delighted to give these a try! And...these donuts were DELISH!!! They were light and fluffy and packed with so much flavor. I tried the strawberry lime coconut. And I couldn't put it down! I loved that I could taste all the flavors and none overpowered the other. Everything blended together so nicely! It was like a party for my taste buds!

Now, that I've had my first taste, I've got to give more a try! There are so many more flavors that I'm excited to sample. 

Go on...be a good co-worker and grab some of these for your office! You will make their day! :)"}
{"text":"Today marks the second time I have had Joe's donuts. The first was when they were still a pop up. At that time the donuts were good but less than memorable. I figured I would give their brick and mortar location a try. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered the special a brownie batter and a regular the maple bacon. Maple icing was good, bacon was soggy. Fudgy icing with little chocolate chips. In general toppings were nothing special. My main complaint is the dough. More dense and chewy than a typical yeast donut. They tasted stale as if they had been sitting out for several hours. Considering it was 8:30 on a saturday morning, I would have though they would have been more fresh. $3 for most of the donuts. Way overpriced for average donuts at best. I can think of no reason why I would go back, especially considering the plethora of other good donut and pastry places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Donut. Cool laid back environment very airy and light hearted. Great for family, dates and etc. Donuts were reasonably priced for what you got. We tried the chocolate with sprinkles.  Will be back"}
{"text":"First experience was a positive one! However, I came on a slow, Tuesday morning. I wanted to avoid the crowds and have the place all to myself. If you want that too, I suggest coming during the week as the weekends can be jam packed. I was hoping to get a pumpkin seasonal flavor, but unfortunately, those weren't available today. The donuts are very reasonable, ~$2.00 each. 

I ordered the cookies 'n cream one because a)I'm a sucker for oreos, b) I'm a sucker for cookies and c) It made perfect sense. I also thought twice about the sea salt caramel and maple bacon, but I'll save those for next time. The cookies 'n cream donut really reminded me of a delicious breakfast cereal and dessert in one. The icing glaze is reminescent of milk, while the oreos speak for themselves. I would have liked the icing to be a little more fresh and melty, though. Only complaint so far. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I tried coming here 3 different times and I FINALLY caught them while they were open. Unfortunately, I'm quite disappointed:(. I had a chocolate glazed donut and I get the feeling it had been sitting out all day. It was cold and had a Cakey texture...put me in the mind of Dunkin Donuts. Maybe I'll try them again early in the morning when they are freshly made."}
{"text":"Took my family here for one of their 'donut decorating' events. Great find in NODA, very kid friendly and a ton of unique donut varieties. Donuts very fresh and great coffee."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try a new donut place but sadly they did not compare to my other local favorites. My sister and I tried the \"special\" white chocolate and strawberry. It was really odd and we couldn't take more then a bite. The cinnamon and sugar was ok but I really don't care for base taste. I'm not sure if it's the dough or what they fry them in."}
{"text":"Donuts were dry, the icing just wasn't good, and customer service was non-existent."}
{"text":"Joe's Doughs sells their donuts on one or two Saturdays a month at The Daily Press in NoDa. Nowadays, there's always a crowd waiting for him to set up his table. I'm afraid to provide this info as i want people to stop showing up so I can have more for myself. They usually arrives at 9:30am so you gotta show up at least 15-30 min early and get ready for the wait, but it's so worth it.

The donuts are usually yeast but he will usually have one or two cake donuts. He does a good job of providing a good variety of donuts offering some standard flavors (chocolate caramel, almond glazed, s'mores) and some more adventurous ones (PB&J, Chicken and Waffles, Tiramisu).  They range from $2-$3 and aren't overly huge which i prefer. You can order a couple to eat and you don't feel like a fatty after wolfing them down.

Cash and credit cards are accepted. Follow them on Instagram at @joedoughs so you know when he'll show up next as well the upcoming flavors for that day.  Be sure to order to support The Daily Press by ordering their awesome coffee and teas as well!"}
{"text":"I ate all the options for vegan donuts ( there was more than one option... There were four!!) and they all were amazing!!! Super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We finally made it here! 

They tend to open at 7am(I think?) and because we got there so late (9:40, Its our day off) they were pretty sold out so my fiance figured why not buy whats left. Which turned out to be a few over a dozen donuts.. and I am not mad about that! Plus it was still a good variety of donuts, choclate topped, vanilla, maple bacon, salted caramel, and the weekly special which was almond joy! 

Now, I am the biggest fan of cake donuts, because well who doesn't love eating cake for breakfast?!  but these yeast donuts were pretty darn great, especially the almond joy and maple bacon.  Yep I need these consistently in my life! Plus the girl behind the counter was so nice she alone made me wanna come back! 

All in all cool place, great donuts, and great people. win, win, win!"}
{"text":"Good for one, not for many.

Located in Charlotte's hidden gem of NoDa, I may have had unreasonable expectations for greatness from this little shop... because well, most of the food in NoDa is outstanding.  

Joe's Doughs however is good, not great.  With a constantly changing menu, their fun variety and openness to the gluten free and vegan community is their greatest strength.  

The shop is small with little atmosphere.  The staff is nice but not the strongest customer service (although in my experience the ladies doing the baking will bend over backwards to help when the counter staff is lacking).  The donuts are light but all the flavor is in the topping.  And most of all they are not designed for group events or special orders.

Twice now I've attempted to work with them on prepaid pre-orders and it's been a major disappointment.  My first order was forgotten about and so I arrived to no donuts and a half hour wait, that was of no fault of the kitchen staff but rather the owner himself forgetting to relay online orders to the shop.  Then this week, in an effort to support local, an organization I'm a part of and I tried to place a large order.  We planned to prepay and attempted to place the order over two weeks in advance so that there were be plenty of time to order extra supplies and bring on additional team members if needed... but it is a no go.  After receiving an immediate response of \"we can totally help with this, we would love to have your business!\" I instead received an email from the owner himself telling me that they would be unable to assist us with the amount we needed because they \"need to have product for our regular Sunday customers.\"

So long story short... if you're looking for one donut on your way through NoDa.  Joe's is a simple option to meet your need but not blow you away.  

However if you're looking to support local when placing a large order or have an event, Joe's is not the option for you and I would encourage you to check out a few of the other local donut shops who will partner with you and celebrate the promotion you are providing them."}
{"text":"The much anticipated Joe Dough's donuts.  I saw the sign on this place a month ago and could NOT wait for opening day!  After seeing their photos and tags all over IG, I just knew this was going to be big, REALLY BIG!!

Charlotte, though we have tons of eateries, we just don't compare to MOST other cities. As for these donuts...they put me in the mind of the most fantastic donuts I have had in a long while: Dough (Brooklyn, NY) 

I drove up on opening day. The line was bananas!! All day, BANANAS! Same thing the following day. I figured I will let the hype die down a little and decided to give them a week.

I ventured in on two different Saturday's the first visit - though I came to buy a dozen the clerk asked me if i could only purchase a half do to the long lines and low inventory.  I only had three varieties to choose from so I just got 2 of each. Let's just saw they looked great, but as far as the taste, this just didn't match my idea of a great tasting donut.

I gave them another try, just thinking that my first visit may have been a quirk.  since they have tried re-vamping the operations maybe something has changed.....Nope.  I stopped in on another day still, low inventory and none of the flavors I was looking for.  I did settle on the lemon and I tell you just not impressed.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE work on the donut itself!! We want you to succeed. We want a great tasting donut is all!! Good luck!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Joe's Doughs. Their donuts are filling and they always have a diverse selection. I only wish it wasn't so close to my house. Also I selfishly hope the Joe in question is Joe Pesci."}
{"text":"Ordering donuts from Joe's Doughs was quick and easy through the online ordering system on their website. I placed my order the same morning as pick-up and it was ready when I arrived. The Chocolate Sprinkle was my favorite! We also got the Maple Bacon, Chicken and Waffle, and Caramel Sea Salt. Thanks for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new storefront in Noda. The line was super long so I had a bit of a wait. It was Father's Day and a Sunday, so that likely made a difference. This was my first time at Joe's Doughs and even with the long line and limited selection available (you could only get a 1/2 dozen rather than a full bc of limited quantities) the donuts were amazing! The staff was clearly working as fast as possible to keep up with the demand and I will say, even though I didn't get to choose my flavors so much, the ones we did get were delicious (peanut butter smores, salted caramel, and strawberry balsamic). I would definitely go back and recommend them for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow. So overrated. We tried three different donuts (over $8), and threw out two of three. We had the goat cheese and strawberry, the maple bacon and chocolate sprinkle. The goat cheese and strawberry tasted like a plain glazed Krispy Kreme donut. Not even a note of goat cheese or strawberry, but smells oddly like cat urine. The chocolate tasted like Hershey's syrup and the donut was dry. The bacon maple is the only one we fully consumed, despite the bacon being the cheap pre-cooked type you find in the supermarket.  I have no idea how this place got such a great rep. Seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this doughnut shop. Hand crafted doughnuts in a hipster neighborhood had us intrigued. We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to get our doughnut fix! We ordered 3 doughnuts and 2 iced coffees. 

The donut lineup:

Boston Creme - perfect! 100%. A+++. The doughnut was soft, the chocolate ganache topping rich, and the creme was delicious! The creme to doughnut ratio was perfect. A generous amount of rich pastry creme with each bite that I took! 

Vanilla Glazed - according to the husband and daughter, this was amazing and their favorite! 

Cinnamon Sugar - my daughters choice, she liked it but said it had a spicy kick to it. 

I would return solely for the Boston Creme doughnut. I've tried many Boston creme doughnuts and most lack flavor of creme, or they are soggy, sometimes they are under filled and way to doughy. These guys got it right. 

Also, the iced coffee was great! Bold, strong flavor of beans but without the bitter burnt taste some beans have. 

Can't wait to return for another Boston Creme Doughnut!"}
{"text":"Solely basing this review off of the donuts. Was looking forward to going as I live in Noda and have heard all the hype. The donuts were ice cold at 8am, and with 3 flavors available is it too hard for one of them to be glazed....? If you like hipster chicks putting poppy seeds on old donuts you'll love this place, I however was extremely dissapointed."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free donuts!! It's hard finding donuts that are gluten free.  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Sugar. Rush.
Frosty pebbles was great but I could only manage 2 bites. Then the cinnamon toast crunch was up, it was decent not as sweet so I made it through one."}
{"text":"So yummy! I had the Strawberry Balsamic Goat Cheese. It was delish! It was so big that I couldn't finish it. I'd wanted to try the pineapple upside down cake but didn't have room. Daughter had Sea Salt Caramel. She gave it a thumbs up. We are pretty picky about our doughnuts, since we have an awesome place to go at home. I think this was better!!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus! These doughnuts are the most fluffiest, tasty doughnuts I've ever had. I'm sure there are some great doughnuts out there that have yet to grace my palette but for now these are the best in Charlotte! I like Krispy Kreme and all. I even like Dunkin... kinda; but these babies....

I already picked up some alcoholic cupcakes. Haven't tried them yet, still sitting in the fridge. Stay tuned. But after riding around, checking out the new developments in neighborhoods, we passed by this joint. My husband and I being fat kids and all, had to come thru (clearly I will be putting in at least 6 days of working out than my normal 5). 

Walked in and it's a nice size place. Clean bathrooms. The blonde hair girl (sorry I can't remember her name) had the biggest, friendliest smile I've ever seen. She was ready and waiting to take our order. Extremely pleasant and patient. 

My dude almost went for the last bag of doughnut holes? But I mean come on, when you have bacon, Caramel, chocolate, and cinnamon staring you in the face, you have to get the full doughnut, not a bag of the same flavor doughnut. 

All four were awesome! My fave was the cinnamon. I just like cinnamon. And honestly because my dude and I have inner fat kids living inside of us, we had to stop at Persuasion to get their fried wings to eat with the doughnuts. If you like chicken and waffles, frosty and fries, cake and chips, then you'll like this combo. TRUST! The whole sweet and salty thing is just my... thing. 

Although good, my least fave was the maple, bacon joint. Again it was good and I'm sure it's popular but I think I'm a simple doughnut gal. Gimme some chocolate or some cinnamon, maybe a lemon doughnut. Add that to a plate of Persuasion fried wings with some hot sauce! MMM!!!"}
{"text":"Update 5/20/2017: I tried again to get good donuts and was disappointed. One was raw, they were inconsistent sizes, and were far from fresh. Three strikes and you're out. Go to Duck Donuts instead.. you won't be dosappo

So, I want to write a good review. The donuts are delicious. But the odds of being able to get them are about 1 in 3. We have actually tried three times to go and have only gotten donuts once. 

One time was a Saturday at ten am. They were out of donuts. All they sell are donuts. How do you run out of the only thing you sell? So we went to Duck Donuts and had some warm, delicious donuts. The next day we got there around 8:30 and they had most of the flavors of donuts. They were good, but about $2/3 each. A little pricey for donuts. 

The following weekend, after remembering how much we liked the salted caramel and chocolate, we tried to get a box on our way out of town. They open at 7. 7:30 on a Sunday, they had no donuts ready. COME ON. You have one job and that is to make donuts.

Just make sure you have a backup plan and a lot of money!"}
{"text":"Joe's Doughs was a highlight of a recent trip down to Charlotte to visit my sister.  While my sister was working from home, I drove on over to Joe's for an iced coffee and to pick up a half dozen donuts for she and I to gorge ourselves on during the day.  When I got there, they had 6 types to choose from so I went with one of each. The chocolate covered, the cinnamon and the sprinkled donuts were standard but really well executed.  Blueberry glazed was really nice, super fruity and the glaze tasted REAL.  The bacon maple tasted like some bacon with pancakes, it was really freaking good.  They also had one with vanilla and a citrusy glaze with nuts.  Can't remember what that was called, but oh man it was tasty.  The iced coffee was also pretty good!  It's a little pricy, but these donuts are clearly made with care and the unique ones are worth the trip when you're local."}
{"text":"Service was good. Interior was clean and fun. The donuts were a pretty big disappointment. At least the yeast donuts were. The toppings were fine but the donut itself left a lot to be desired. We got a dozen, and the kids barely finished one each. After using the microwave in store to heat up the texture improved slightly but the taste was still rather bland."}
{"text":"TLDR: You will NOT be disappointed with Joe's donuts. Not only are the flavors very creative, Joe manages to balance the taste with the right ingredient pairings and sweet/salty levels.

Recommendations: Definitely try the cake-based doughnuts, show up early (otherwise you'll miss some flavors) and try every new flavor out there (they are seasonal)."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing!  And the rotating specials are out of this world.  They are the perfect consistency, and the flavor is always on point. The bacon is cooked perfectly, and the maple frosting is better than Duck Donuts."}
{"text":"So the donuts were good, and they traveled rather well (better than duck donuts does). They arrived fresh, but not soggy, and they boxed them in pizza boxes. Everyone got a kick out of that. I ordered 4 dozen donuts for International Women's Day in our office this year. I had some trouble with the website but Joe and Jasmine were amazing!! Seriously though they were so helpful and were willing to work with me on everything. I had the chocolate glazed donut once they arrived and it was tasty. I also tried to cronut type donut and It just wasn't for me. However my co-workers thought it was awesome. Everyone was impressed with the assortment and they didn't last long!!

I can't comment on the location, as I had another co-worker pick them up since he lives just down the street. I'm really interested in going back in person and trying some other donuts that they have on menu."}
{"text":"Hit Joe's this past weekend to indulge in something sugary sweet. They have a rotating array about every hour and they have about 7-8 different creations at a time!
I dug the vanilla bean glaze, which I got, and the chocolate glaze with sprinkles. I think I liked these because the glaze was very sweet. The dough is not at all. I think they even had an everything douhgnut that day with what appears to be poppy seeds, garlic salt, etc. 
I think that I'm a Dunkin girl more because those doughnuts just are not as seemingly greasy. I think these seem heavier to me because the are fresh so Im not gonna knock them on that, but I know Ill be back to see what other flavor combos they create. The sea salt and caramel one my friend got was housed in about 5 seconds."}
{"text":"Joe's Doughs currently sells their donuts Saturday's at The Daily Press and takes special orders throughout the week. They don't have a brick and mortar location as of now. Their donuts are a yeast donut base (however I believe they are working on some cake donuts). They are currently priced at 2 dollars/donut. I have tried the raspberry vanilla and the chocolate coconut donut. Both were very good but the chocolate coconut cake was my favorite. These donuts are better than Krispy Kreme! Sooooo good!!!! Make sure you get to the daily press at 9:30 because these donuts go fast!"}
{"text":"It was decent. Krispy Kreme and Dunkin taste better."}
{"text":"Yes, the donuts are delicious. The vanilla glazed is perhaps the best thing I've ever tasted. And, yes, I know these are handmade donuts. BUT I should not walk into a donut shop and they only have 12 donuts for sale. Not 12 kinds. 12 donuts. The were very apologetic, but that doesn't make up for the annoyance and inconvenience of making a special trip and being stuck with what was left. I especially did not like being told I should call ahead next time. That suggests that either I did something wrong or that an empty store is a common occurrence. Either way, I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"I took my team here for an afternoon treat after waiting for opening crowds to die down. We came in just after lunch and there were plenty of tables and donuts to choose from. The decor is nice and the kids' colorings of donuts is a fun addition. 

This particular day, there was a sign on the door announcing they'd moved to weekend only hours due to a lack of business during the week. While I appreciate the transparency, as a customer I should've taken this as a warning. 

I used to love the texture of these donuts at the pop up shops around town. Unfortunately they are just nothing like those little pillows of tastiness I was used to getting. The flavors this weekend were all candy shoppe flavors. While good, they were really nothing to write home about. 

What makes this a subpar review was the service. No one greeted us when we entered the shop and no one thanked us or said goodbye as we were leaving. Note - at 1 PM, it was also not at all busy. The cashier also didn't seem to be totally into what he was doing. He rang up our donuts at $3 a piece instead of $2 for three of them and $3 for one. It had already taken several minutes to get them and I didn't have the energy to argue with him over it. 

It came to $16 for 4 donuts and two coffees (which seemed expensive for what we got). The register is an iPad (which is fine...normal these days). When I signed, I asked for a receipt. When they clearly could not print one (every other place that has an iPad register can print receipts), I asked for an emailed receipt. The response I got was, \"You didn't hit the button to get an email?\"

No, no I did not since there wasn't one and I didn't click to the next screen to have missed it. He got another employee who told me to leave my email address on a business card and they'd send it to me before their close of business. 

Unfortunately I never got the receipt. Unless the recipe changes back to the original or service shapes up, I have a feeling I won't be returning and the hours of operation might continue to shrink. :-("}
{"text":"Love Joe's Doughs! We first tried them at The Daily Press and were blown away by the quality and unique flavors. I love the fact that it's a pop up service and the crafty set up for service with the daily flavors on pedestals for help with decision making. Definitely recommend for something tasty and different from your average doughnuts."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been working our way through the CLT donut scene (I know, tough job) and this morning we landed at Joe's!

First impressions: 

- The building is sweet (haha, donut pun!). Love the artwork painted on the sides. 

-The parking lot, one of the worst I've parked in. Half empty liquor bottles, giant holes, it's a mess out there...

- Inside is really cool. They have a nice open area where you can watch the bakers do their thing and a cool little display of their daily donut offerings. I would sit in there happily!


Ordering:

Ok so we preordered online because we heard this place sells out quick. I AIN'T TRYIN TO GET SNUBBED AFTER DRIVING A HALF HOUR YO. The online ordering process was a piece of cake (bakery related, pun still counts). 6 donuts with a tip came out $16 and change. Ok damn that's expensive...


The Donuts:

Look I follow these guys on Instagram and it all looks amazing. There is hype all over for this place. 

I have never in my entire life been served an oily donut. I'm not talking a little grease, in talking soaked through the box. Joe's, what in the name of all that is donut hole-y (DONUT PUN!) happened? So so so disappointed...

The glazes are good, but neither my wife of myself are sucking down grease sponges today. Maybe today was an off day. I hope it was just a fluke. For now my advice is do-nut go here. (Last pun, I promise)"}
{"text":"My son brought me here for Father's Day and let me choose a donut.  I chose one and was somewhat satisfied.  Coffee was robust.  Will return when they have everything worked out.  Not sure if bathroom was broken, but toilet and sink were problematic."}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!!!! Great variety of flavors and I love that they offer gluten free and vegan options!"}
{"text":"Joe's Doughs is a legit shop. It's a bit of a ways from the city, but not too far. There is ample parking. The inside is cute and inviting. They have counter seating and tables throughout. 

The goods? They were okay. The cinnamon sugar left an odd baking soda taste in my mouth. It wasn't incorporated well enough. It was good otherwise. It was the least sweet of the variety in the dozen my family and I purchased. The glaze was overly sweet. I loved the unique flavors though. The spicy carrot was pretty damn amazing! Again, the glaze prevented it from being a 5/5. The chocolate glazed tastes like pudding! Yum! They were out of bottled water so we got cups for the drinking fountain, found near the entrance, by the bathrooms. 

I wanted to love the donuts here, but I couldn't as they were just okay and far too sweet. Maybe it was a fluke. I'm not sure. I give the workers a 5/5 and the donuts a 3/5."}
{"text":"I loved that they had such original and delicious flavors! They change flavors every 45-60 mins which forces you to try new things. Usually that would annoy me because I am a creature of habit but these flavors are all so good! Also! VEGAN OPTIONS! This is really awesome since I am vegan and while there are a lot of food options in charlotte there are very few vegan dessert options. The vegan cinnamon sugar donut is twice as big as the nonvegan donuts and it was crazy dough-y and light. Honestly, one of the best donuts I have ever had. And they have such friendly people behind the counter. All around a great place to go for a treat or coffee!! :)"}
{"text":"I am so glad to see this store front finally open! These donuts are unconventional, unique, and delicious. Maple bacon, everything, and candied lemon are my favorites. What's not to love about donuts?"}
{"text":"My agenda at 6am this morning? The same thing I do every morning \"Pinky; try to take over the world\". (If you recognize this quote, we should be friends.)

Sunday is planning day, and with aggressive deadlines ahead, decided to make my way to Joe's for a 1/2 dozen to keep me sugared up all day. Stopped by on opening Sat but left after 30 min as people were walking out saying they were running out of stuff.  No prob. I understand. Opening day! Visited website to learn standard flavors, and though still awaiting the Coconut Milk with Thai Basil -which I hoped in vain for weeks to be featured during their pop-up Sats- I resolved to enjoy a few gluten-frees today. I'd buy one, eat it in my car, and if great, buy 5 more. Arrived elated, to no line and only a few cars in the parking lot, at 8:10am. They're open from 7-3pm.

There were only 3 donuts on the little display. I didn't panic. Sydney greeted me. I asked about the topping options for the gluten-frees, and she said she didn't think they were ready yet. I asked how much longer, thinking 10-20min, and she said they usually don't make them until the afternoon. Wait....What? 

Also needed to know what flours/starches are used in the gluten-frees (Rice? Corn? Arrowroot?). She didn't know, so I asked if she minded asking the baker/manager who was standing a few feet away. I'd read much of their press and recognized her by her green hair. Actually, there were 2 women with green highlights. Sydney returned with her response: \" She said it is a gluten-free flour.\" I blinked away the offense, instead empathizing with Sydney, seeing the pained look in her eyes at having to deliver what she knew was a rudely dismissive answer. I said \"Here's an idea. I'm sure the gluten-free flour has the ingredients listed on the packaging. Can someone check?\" Sydney brilliantly took the initiative, returning in less than 45 sec with the ingredients. How do the head bakers not even know the ingredients of their own donuts? Why would such an important question be met with such disregard? 

To not leave empty handed after the significant drive and time invested, I reluctantly decided to break protocol and go for the Goat Cheese Strawberry Balsamic . \"We won't make those until later.\" Floored. Tell me you ran out of strawberries. Tell me goat farmers went on strike last week.  Blame it on Brexit! Do not tell me you just haven't made them \"yet\". It's 8am for Christ's sake. It's one of your \"standards\"! Exhausted, I said \"Ok...then a Chocolate Glazed with sprinkles\"....... \"None are ready\".

(Be graceful Siana. This will all be over soon. Just. Be. Graceful.) There was a fresh tray of plain donuts on the racks. I asked how much longer before they could be topped...5 min? 15min? 30? \"Green\" told Sydney she didn't know because she had to finish frying the donuts. She had NO idea. None. In a last ditch effort to salvage the experience, I asked if they could top a donut with maple glaze but hold the bacon. I told Sydney I would go sit outside and wait a few. Sydney came outside and said the donuts could be topped in 10 min. After 12 min, went back in. Donut was waiting on counter. Paid and asked for receipt. Nope. Told it could be emailed to my email address. *sigh*

Throughout the debacle, Sydney was impeccable. From start to finish, she was nothing less than courteous and did her best to deal with the inefficiencies around her. I think I read the manager/head baker is a graduate of Johnson Wales culinary school. Will avoid any assumptions about her operational management training, and people skills. Was odd that being only a few feet away, she chose to not address me at all or make eye contact. I was the only one at the counter for some time. Funny, though a recent article boasts an all female staff, these ladies had that roller derby look, and I imagined \"Green\" thinking \"If I wasn't frying these donuts, I'd kick your ass.\"

Got in my vehicle and closed my eyes: \"God of all things delectable and habit-forming...Please let this donut win.\" Have NEVER written a 1 star review. A voice responded: \"Have no fear. Proceed.\" 

AND THAT IS HOW YOU TAKE ON THE DONUT SCENE IN CHARLOTTE.

Soft, light, chewy. Oddly familiar, yet unlike a donut. Then I realized...a zeppole! It tastes like Italian Zeppoles, which I grew up eating in Brooklyn. It also tastes similar to a staple of Caribbean breakfasts' known as a \"bake\". Joe's will get it together. One day this may be a 5 star review. I have a soft spot for dream chasers and know too well the challenges of a new business.  Still, just have the donuts ready Joe. I know you're rocking out in LA with your band. Please don't go the way of new spots that take the attitude \"we have plenty of customers, fans, followers.  If they want our donuts, they will wait or come back.\" Don't go that route. All progress in Charlotte rests on those donuts being ready. Do your part Joe. 

Now, back to world domination."}
{"text":"A coworker was kind enough to bring in a dozen of donuts. Let's just say she is my new BFF!!!!! Everything I tried was awesome! I had the goat cheese and balsamic, lemon it had lemon zest on top and a cinnamon one! All I can say is wow!!!!! I have to go there immediately! The family and I will be there soon! This may be an overdose situation for my 6y/o LOL"}
{"text":"Doughnuts are very small for the price. Not many flavor options, and the cake doughnuts really leave something else to be desired. For the price would rather go to Dunkin or Krispy Kreme and get a similar if not better doughnut."}
{"text":"Pretty creative concept for the doughnuts. Worth trying but not my favorite place to eat at. Give it a try and make your own decision."}
{"text":"First time stopping in to try the doughnuts and I must say I was impressed!  Tried the Maple Bacon and the the Vanilla frosting.  The Maple Bacon doughnut was unique and different than anything in recent memory.  I loved it.  I feel like they put a lot of time perfecting the unique salty sweet flavor and it paid off.  The doughnut itself was top notch as it was as fresh as can be and noticeably so because they make everything from Scratch right there on the day you buy it.  I like there style of doughnut because it is more light and airy then say Duck Doughnuts which are slightly heavier.    The location is a hip factory store setting in Noda and has potential to be something that sticks around.

Doughnuts:  5/5
Location:  4/5


Will return because its worth the trip."}
{"text":"Joe's Doughs has some major hits and a few misses. 

The building is totally cool. It is a white brick exterior, with a huge \"Joe's Doughs\" sign and plenty of parking. The industrial interior, with a huge wall of windows that let in plenty of light, is a perfect setting for weekend work. While cement floors and white walls could look sterile, Joe's Doughs instead appears fresh, clean, and inviting.

Joe's Doughs makes yeast donuts, and claims that fresh donuts are made every hour. The menu changes depending on what the pastry chef makes that day; when I was there the options were Vanilla Icing with Sprinkles, Vanilla Glazed, Earl Grey and Blueberry Glazed, Cinnamon Sugar, Chocolate Glazed, and Maple Icing with Bacon. The options are cutely displayed on little pedestals. 

My companion and I decided to try Vanilla Glazed, Chocolate Icing with Sprinkles and Cinnamon Sugar. The Cinnamon Sugar was very fluffy but the donut itself lacked flavor. The Chocolate Icing with Sprinkles was too chocolatey for us. I imagine lots of people would love it. The chocolate was likely semi-sweet, and just too rich for us. There was a perfect amount of sprinkles though! The star of the show was the Vanilla Glazed. The vanilla was made with real vanilla beans and it had good texture.

Joe's Doughs lacks an espresso machine, which always angers me in a donut store (see my review of Duck Donuts). Donuts need coffee, and drip just doesn't do it for me! The lack of an espresso machine, along with the $2+ price tag of the donuts, is why I gave Joe's Doughs three stars."}
{"text":"I've had Joe's Doughs on multiple occasions, this just happened to be my first time checking out their new digs.

I had a free Saturday afternoon and decided it was a good time, albeit a little risky, to drop by. I considered it a little risky because I came twenty minutes before closing and fully expected them to tell me that they were out of doughnuts or at least only had one to choose from. I was pleasantly surprised that was not the case. I walked right up to the counter (no line!) and then had to deal with making a decision. Options available at that time were the espresso cake, vanilla glazed, everything, lemon blueberry, goat cheese strawberry balsamic, maple bacon, and the sprinkle.

I hemmed and hawed for a moment and decided to go with the everything and lemon blueberry. The lemon blueberry was their featured doughnut that day. The decision wasn't all that hard considering I had previously tried all but three. Both doughnuts rang up to a total of $5.41.

Of the two that I got that day, the lemon blueberry was hands down my favorite. It had a blueberry filling and lemon icing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Sweet but not too sticky sweet. That's another reason why I like Joe's because they are creative with flavor pairings and also not afraid to heavily feature savory options. The everything doughnut tasted exactly like an everything bagel, it wasn't bad but it's definitely not anything I would order again.

My absolute favorite (as of right now) is the peanut butter smore. Light, fluffy, filled with marshmallow - I mean what more could you ask for? (other than a stack of napkins because it gets messy). I've also had the ever-popular maple bacon which is a good, solid choice but I feel like that flavor combo is a little overdone. The vanilla glazed is simple and sweet, good for someone who isn't completely crazy for doughnuts.

The fact that they are always coming up with new flavors makes it easy for this doughnut lover to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Some may like ... some may not ....but to me the donuts taste like white bread  with different sugar toppings .  And they were cold ( that made it even more like wonder bread ) If you like that kind of thing cool but not my cup o coffee . 
Staff was cool . I won't give it a \"bad\" rating but after the 2nd try I was good on  joes ."}
{"text":"There was quite a hype about this place so I thought this may be the \"your moms donuts\" or \"duck donuts\" version for Noda but I have to say it wasn't quite like that. The specialty ones weren't appealing at all and tasted odd. The only one we liked was the sea salt caramel one. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I have had joe's doughnut twice now and it has been amazing both times!  Today they set their pop up shop at the small market next to pure pizza central ave.  it was a match made in heaven because one of my favorite local coffee shops, Not Just Coffee, had set a pop up right next to them as well.  Amazing doughnuts and nitro cold brew!! Can life get much better?!??!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out this newer donut shop in NODA for awhile and I had a chance to try it yesterday.  I had read a ton of reviews that this place was excellent with a ton of flavors!

It is located right on the edge of NODA, a bit down the street from all of the bars and restaurants as well as breweries.  It is located right in front of some construction companies.

I was looking forward to a variety of types of donuts but there was a small selection this day- there had been storms so the power was knocked off overnight and the choices were slim.  Sprinkles, espresso, sea salt chocolate caramel and banana coconut caramel cake.  I was picking up some for my friend and I so I decided to get one of each except the banana.  We liked them all, but the sprinkles was my least favorite.  

I'd be interested in going back when there were more flavors to try...it was a cute spot including outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"This spot is one of my guilty pleasures in NoDa. My favorite doughnuts are the vanilla glaze ( simple perfection) and the chocolate sprinkles . I also find it a neat place to hang out and read , or chill with friends. They have hot free-trade coffee available, and a nice seating area for when the weather is good. Great place to bring kids-kids tables and coloring sheets/crayons."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my trip to Joe's Doughs. The donuts were cold and the icing was congealed. There was minimal variety in flavors."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Joe's Doughs I was so excited to have a great donut shop in the neighborhood. I really do want to like this place but after trying three times, I think I'd rather go somewhere that is more reliable. 

On my first visit, we had two maple donuts that were good. On the second visit, there were no donuts at all, just coffee. On my third visit (today), I was told that the Saturday Specials \"weren't ready yet.\" I would believe that at almost 9am on a Saturday that you should have your daily specials prepared. 

I'm sure this feedback will not be well received by the company/owner based on previous interactions that I've witnessed on social media. For the sake of the neighborhood, I do wish Joe's Doughs the best of luck but that will most likely require some changes to their current practices."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful first visit to Joe's doughs! I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and will say that my first experience did not disappoint. By far the best independently owned donut shop that I've tried in the Charlotte area. The flavor Varieties were wonderful and plentiful. The donuts were the texture and denseness. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"It Finally Arrives in NoDa!!! And it does not disappoint.

My wife and I went on the first day.  Lines were very long, but that was expected.  The staff was nice and handled the pressure well.

We got two donuts, Maple Bacon and Goat Cheese Strawberry Balsamic.  The former was Epic.  Just epic.
The latter was... experimental.  We went out on a limb and tried something different.  That doesn't always pan out.  But that is personal preference.

We live the donuts here, and are so happy they have a full time home in NoDa."}
{"text":"Did not actually go but had these doughnuts brought to us for our morning shift! I definitely will be going back! You can tell they are small batch and made with LOVE! Joes is definitely providing us with some of the best Charlotte doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Expensive fancy donuts. Thats what you get here. I think Im spoiled when it comes to this category. Maybe this is the bar for charlotte but compared to other larger cities like atlanta joes donuts just didnt make the cut. The dining area is more like a school cafeteria, it had an industrial feel but not in a cool edgy way, more like a cheap way. The donuts were just ok nothing mind blowing and def not worth the price. If you like $5 donuts that are just aight then strap on your baby bjorn comb your beard  and head on over."}
{"text":"Vey obsessed with the Peanut Butter Jelly and marshmallow flavored donut. I would definitely pick this place over Duck Donuts! I feel in love at first bite!"}
{"text":"I wish I could high five or hug Joe (in a very manly way) - but he's usually making or frosting donuts!

The brick and mortar shop next to Abari is going to be a real hit - okay, so that's yesterdays news as it obviously is already. So says the throngs that flock here.

Nothing fancy just delicious warm, fresh donuts made every hour. I like the system where they put samples on pedestals with nametags. That way I can decide which one I'm going to eat next - sometimes you just have to pace yourself! (and sometimes it gets ugly - I call it a donut massacre).

I am a purist so I started with cinnamon sugar, moved on to vanilla glazed and finished with chocolate glaze with rainbow sprinkles. Once I get a little braver I'll try the Goat Cheese Strawberry Balsamic.

The Brazilian Eldery Coffee is the way to go as far as caffeine is concerned.

Would love to see some more indoor seating along the side wall and I think they just need to buy a cow so they don't run out of milk for the kiddos. 

I love Joe's - as if NODA couldn't get any better, we have an awesome Donut Shop now. Fair prices, great coffee and shiny happy people!

All I can say is - never underestimate the happiness a warm donut will bring you!"}
{"text":"Being out of town we were super excited to try out these alcohol infused doughnuts. Didn't realize that they close down because they get sold out frequently. Looked really cool on the outside but couldn't even walk in because they closed up shop at 1145 when it stated they were open until 1pm, until we saw the signs....the up side was that we got a pic with Yoda who was painted on the wall outside, the down side is we walked disappointed and still hungry."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have in the neighborhood! The donuts are fantastic and they have new different flavors every week. They also have a regular list of donuts they have all the time that are sure crowd pleasers, especially for kids! The chocolate sprinkles is too good! They are located right next to Abari so donuts and video games is a great outing for the fam! 

Staff was super friendly and helpful. The coffee was good and they said that more drink selection is on the way. I stop by here on the regular for my morning cup, so that's exciting too."}
{"text":"Finally made it over for donuts and I'm not all that impressed. The apple cake donut was pretty great however the remaining five donuts we selected were so heavy. Not the light a fluffy donuts I was looking for these are dense rounds of bread. I'll stick with Duck."}
{"text":"We went to Joe's Doughs for a little Sunday treat. They had a selection of several flavors - some classic, some creative concoctions. \"The Heath\" was a nice choice! The donut was not too sweet either. The actual \"dough\" part was light and fluffy, and cooked nicely. The shop atmosphere is very calm and relaxed. It seems like a nice place to bring the family or friends."}
{"text":"I messed up and left my review for Joe's Doughs on another restaurant's page. I guess my excitement for this place got the best of me :) 

The smell of this place when you walk in would captivate anyone and their donuts thankfully lived up to the amazing smell! These donuts are FRESH - made every hour!! Their staff is so friendly as well which made the experience pretty awesome. I haven't had the chance to try all of them but my favorites so far are the Sea Salt Chocolate Caramel and Candied Lemon donuts. Can't wait to return for more!"}
{"text":"They had me at \"vegan donuts\"...and once I was finally able to taste the vegan donut (cinnamon sugar) it did not disappoint!

I recently learned of Joe's Doughs online and was happy to see that they sell a vegan donut and that they would be opening a storefront in NoDa.  It opened this past Saturday and I finally made my way there today (Wednesday).  I got the last three vegan donuts they had (sorry, fellow vegans!) and rounded out the dozen with other flavors for my co-workers.  They all really enjoyed them.  Per one of my co-workers who enjoyed one of the non-vegan donuts, \"I have to say, that was the most moist doughnut I have ever had...it wasn't even like a doughnut! It was more like a French pastry.   There is really no comparison to Dunkin'!\".

As for the vegan donut, I sliced it in half and planned to only eat half because I'd just finished lunch.  Well, that other half lasted for about 90 seconds.  ;)  The donut was really, really good!  I've been vegan for a little over 6 years and I love my vegan treats.  I also regularly bake my own vegan desserts for (vegan and non-vegan) friends and family members.  Holiday desserts, birthday cakes, etc. are all vegan and there are no complaints.  I know what is/isn't a good vegan version of something and these are great!  Kudos to Joe's Doughs for showing the vegans some love!  Particularly since I've yet to try to make my own donuts.  ;)

I look forward to seeing their vegan options continue to evolve over time! 

Thanks again, Joe's Doughs!"}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars for creativity. Not that much on the donut. I found them to have a bread like texture. Loved the variety of flavors. Service was good."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could give any less than 5 stars to any place that's sole purpose is to sell donuts and coffee. It should just be a default rating. In the case of Joe's Doughs I would give 10 stars. They get the automatic 5 for being a donut shop and 5 more for having really delicious donuts and friendly service. 

We went on opening day and while the line was out the doors, they seemed to have a pretty efficient method for getting things done. I went early so it could have gotten a bit more chaotic as the day went on. I got half a dozen to split with some friends, and got a good variety. We had 

* PB&J
* s'mores peanut butter
* chocolate with sprinkles
* goat cheese and strawberry balsamic 
* cinnamon sugar
* everything 

Let's talk about that everything donut real quick. It's the toppings of an everything bagel slapped a'top a vanilla frosted donut. It was... interesting. My recommendation is to order one and split it with friends so you can say you tried it. 

Of the remaining donuts on that list, the PB&J was my favorite but they were all really freaking good. Like... GOOD. The coffee was Enderly coffee which is a local personal fave of mine. Yum!

I'm glad to see the direction this business is going in, and happy to be able to support them. Definitely check them out, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If I could propose, or recommend, or hope for anything different it would be a recycling bin for the cardboard donut boxes (which maybe they have and I missed)."}
{"text":"Great place to get some fresh, local, and unique flavored donuts. There are usually four or five rotating flavors with different toppings. I have tried nearly all of them and I haven't been disappointed. Definitely come early to make sure you get your pick as they sell out pretty fast. Check their social media for special releases and availability."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious donuts. Chocolate sprinkles is divine. Good size for the price and lovely location."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Saturday and was super excited to try their vegan options. Cool thing is all the dough is vegan! Just have different icings that aren't. They had three different kinds I just tried two, chocolate and vanilla. Both flavors were good, and loved it with a cup of coffee. Definitely go check it out. :) they're nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and was so excited to try it. I got a half a dozen donuts for $22. All of the donuts except for one tasted like they been sitting around for a very long time. The one that didn't taste old was just average. I was completely disappointed. I had friends in from out of town and we all thought that the donuts tasted old. Totally bummed and I'm just hoping they were having a really bad day."}
{"text":"Horibble Horrible Harribel! just bad no matter how you spell it! Been there 3 times and each time they were out of maple bacon. Really? The donuts are hardly warm.  They have a few good flavors but nothing that makes you want to go with them over others. This place needs revamping already if they want to compete with everyone else."}
{"text":"Let me start with - This place has been open for 3 days. I tried giving a 4.5 rating but Yelp wouldn't let me (blame it on them). I knew of Joe's Doughs from an event at the Omni Hotel - my booth was set up across from them and thought their product looked great. They opened up shop this past weekend and I knew I had to go check it out!  I bought 9 different doughnuts and sampled most of them until I got full. I got - espresso, chocolate, vanilla bean, candied lemon, peanut butter s'mores, caramel, banana coconut caramel, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter and jelly. My favorites: Peanut butter and jelly and coconut banana caramel. 

The coconut banana caramel is basically fried banana bread - that is not bad thing - they fried banana bread. The caramel is definitely homemade - thank you Joes Doughs for making the caramel and the toasted coconut provided a nice crunch. The peanut butter and jelly was filled with strawwwberrrry!!! YAS, Score, High Five -you knew what you were doing. I thought I'd be more excited to eat the peanut butter s'mores (because i love peanut butter) but it didn't do it to me...maybe some graham cracker crumbs were added for texture or more peanut butter, I'm not sure. And if you like lemon, you'll love the candied lemon doughnut. That kicked my face with lemon and it was great. I couldn't eat a whole lemon doughnut but the bite I had was awesome. 

I'm a fan, I'll be back, they're in the PERFECT location. I'm sure Hart's Soda Shop will be around for them to pair up with and they're next to an arcade (business driving). Great job you guys - this place is on it's way up."}
{"text":"We wanted to wait and review this place after we tried it three times. All places to deserve second and third chances, especially a brand new establishment. But, it pains me to say, we are so disappointed. The staff was nice but not very informative and acted as if we should know what each donut was before we asked. The excitement we had every time we walked in, turned to disappointment as we watch the bakers make these fresh hot donuts and they come to us tasting cold and stale. The icing becomes crust-like and crumbles off if you attempt to cut it and the donut itself is not anything great. We wanted so badly to love this place because who doesn't love a hot fresh homemade donut!!!?"}
{"text":"The associate told me their donuts are gluten free but their icing isn't (insert look of confusion on my face). I ordered 4 donuts for $9. The flavor and texture of the donuts were pretty close to Krispy Kreme, but the icing was pretty awful. It was rich at first but after eating a whole donut it left a chemical taste in my mouth. Almost as if they use too much artificial sweetener or something."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Joe's Doughs on a Saturday afternoon with a buddy.  We had a couple rounds at Birdsong so I was in need of caffeine.  I was a little scared there would be a line out the door considering the parking lot was full (must have been a party over at Abari next door or something), but pleasantly surprised when there was no line.

You could kind of tell the place was recovering from the Saturday morning rush, but no worries, the doughnuts were pre-made (but fresh every hour or so) and the hardest decision was which doughnut to have.  They are displayed really nicely (kinda reminded me of a high end clothing store where they put their products on different levels or a store window front).  Luckily there's a nice clear barrier (I'm going to call it a drool shield) since they look so delicious.

I'm assuming or order was taken by Joe himself, while the other workers were working hard (probably on the next batch) in the back.  I decided on a salted caramel chocolate doughnut and was surprised how light and airy it was.  I was expecting a pretty dense treat, but it was rather light... I also got to try a bite of the cinnamon sugar and it was delicious.

Coffee was spot on... Chose the Brazilian coffee over the African since I was still recovering from the Rio opening ceremonies the night before.  But I'm sure both coffees are equally good.

Nice outdoor patio space for when it finally is not summer and 1,000,000 degrees with 100% humidity, There were a couple of tables (four I think) with chairs to relax in, though I have a feeling this place gets to be standing room only when the morning rush comes in on weekends."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.. and I'm asking myself why did I wait so long. It's so good. So fresh. And the combos are heaven in your mouth. Maple bacon was by far out favorite flavor!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Not a bad joint. A cool rhymey name is always an attention grabber. I think it should be Joe's Doughs & Joes though. The trifecta. It's Joe's. It's ring-shaped dough. And it's cups of joe.

I've only been once but I know already the doughnuts are quality. They ought to be at $2.50+ each. My salted caramel and chocolate one was great. My girlfriend thought her cake doughnut was too dense and...well...cakey. Who am I to judge? But yeah, they're expensive for singles. Make it a tapas trip or something. Go for the novelty of it.

We didn't have any coffee so I can't speak to the quality of that. It was pretty dead on a Sunday morning and even the staff was not chatty or attentive. I chock it up to folks still waking up after a night of partying. I'll try to make it back in some day when I get hit with that sweet tooth craving."}
{"text":"Went back to Joe's a few months later to try them out again, and I'm impressed. The donut base is better, the glazes were better, there were some really fun donuts, and I think they have found their stride. 

Again, I picked them up for work. I grabbed 2 of each of the following: cookies and cream, blueberry glaze, old fashioned cake, maple bacon, PB&J, and chocolate with sprinkles. When I opened the box, there were quite a few oohs and ahs because they looked really good. 

My co-worker who had a blueberry glaze said it was really great because it wasn't too sweet and the glaze had a nice tartness from the blueberries. I had a chocolate with sprinkles and the balance of icing to donut was perfect. This time the donut base was not bready, but it had that perfect softness and chew while still being flavorful enough to stand up to the toppings. 

I'm glad to be able to come back and give Joe's Doughs a higher rating, and look forward to some interesting treats in the near future."}
{"text":"My espresso/cereal/cake donut (chocolate cake, glaze and stale golden grahams) was nothing to write home about but my fiancé loved his everything glazed donut! They posted on their instagram page that the everything glazed donuts were all the rage and they are right. Plain glazed with everything seasoning you would find on an everything bagel - poppy, sesame, salt and onion. He said it was crazy but delicious! It was also much larger than mine."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try Joe's Doughs today with my girlfriend, but we both left a bit disappointed. We tried the cinnamon sugar, maple bacon, and chocolate sprinkles. Each was okay, but I wasn't a fan of the donut base at all. It tasted more like bread than a typical donut base, and the donuts reminded me of Hawaiian bread bought from the store with some cool toppings added. The maple bacon was our favorite - kinda. The bacon overpowered everything else, but without the bacon, the maple glaze was really good. The chocolate sprinkle was alright, and the cinnamon sugar was pretty meh. It just had huge chunks of sugar granules over the top without much cinnamon flavor. 
Overall, the donuts certainly weren't bad, but I didn't taste anything that would warrant $2-3 per donut or such high ratings."}
{"text":"Hello review #400. Who deserves such a milestone? Well, considering the fact I stalk Joe's Doughs all over social media, I do believe they deserve this love letter. And by stalk, we're talking like a bat ish crazy ex clicking on the profiles of everyone who liked your pictures kind of cray cray.

There is no brick and mortar store, at least not yet. So, how can you find them? Follow all their social media channels to see where they'll be popping up and also what flavors they will have. They do a lot of Saturdays at The Daily Press. 

Don't come expecting your regular old glazed donuts. These are gourmet handmade goodness where the sky's the limit for variety... Goat Cheese Honey Almond, Beet Red Velvet Cake, Fruity Pebble. Come on. Eat your hearts out Dunkin and Krispy Kreme. 

Important note: they go quickly. Why? Because they are freaking delicious and I'm not the only person in Charlotte stalking them. Plan accordingly. Also, Joe is a super nice guy. Best of luck and I can't wait until you guys find a storefront!

Added edit/note: Joe messaged me on here to let me know that the storefront will be open THIS Spring at 1721 N. Davidson St. Construction starts first week of January!"}
{"text":"I wonder if some of the other reviewers (or joes staff) have been to other donut shops.  If your only donuts have been dunkin or Krispy Kreme then joes probably seems like it's got it going on, even tho a fresh Krispy Kreme is a thing of beauty.

However if you've been to other places besides the big chains, joes falls a little flat.  Dynamo donut, doughnut plant, voodoo doughnut, duck donuts (becoming a chain, for good reason).  Sure these places have some history but they also have really tasty donuts.  joes has some interesting ideas but the foundation is a bland, somewhat stale donut.  I mean it's not called Joe's wacky frosting.

When joes was just a Popup at daily press we gave it a try.  They've improved some since then, those donuts had a distinct \"dinner roll\" yeasty taste.  I would just ask their staff this - would you eat one of your donuts with nothing on it?  I'd tweak the recipe until the answer is yes."}
{"text":"Go for the one-off donuts, but don't bother trying to coordinate to make a bulk order. I initially wanted to use them for my wedding on March 24, 2017, but decided to go in a different direction when I didn't hear from the owner after a series of email exchanges where we honed in on ideas and quantities, but never confirmed or agreed to ANYTHING. Almost a year later, I receive an email today, March 13, 2017, from the owner - after no communication beyond the initial pre-negotiation in May 2016, where, again, nothing was confirmed - asking when the donuts would be picked up this Friday, March 17, 2017, for my wedding. To start, my wedding is not taking place on March 17, but on March 24. That is an issue in and of itself. Even if we had confirmed a bulk donut order and paid a deposit for them, I would have expected to hear about this WELL in advance of my wedding date, not four days before it was allegedly taking place. The owner would have known that, had he bothered to reach out to me to fill out an order form that, to my knowledge, was never completed or seen by me. 

Through a series of miscommunications, I was not only accused by the owner of being untrustworthy, but I was also accused of not being supportive of small business in the community where I reside. So, I won't tell you not to go here - in fact, I'll leave my initial review below because I stand by my positive experience in-store with the employees and my sentiments regarding small business - but I will tell you that there are other small businesses in Charlotte that won't hold you responsible for their own oversight and presumptive behavior."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Can I just stop there?  We went later in the day son the salted caramel doughnuts by the time we got home was rather \"old\".  The guy working suggested 10 seconds in the microwave. ...perfect."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of gourmet donuts so I was excited to see Charlotte get a new place buuuuut I was kind of disappointed. The base of the donut was just okay and I didn't really like that it was the same for every type of donut.

We tried four different kinds: maple bacon, white chocolate strawberry, peanut butter smores and some type of brownie batter one. Don't get me wrong they were good! 

I does seem like the varieties of donuts they have are always changing which is great! It's a nice little place.."}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying the two donuts I have had were very good.  The candies lemon had candied peel placed perfectly so you get one in each bite.  Well done.   The peanut butter smores has an excellent filling that took it to the next level.  If my review was based just on donuts it would be a 5 star but it's not.  I have been here twice in 3 days and both times they have only had 4 flavors.  I have been in at 830 both times so they were not sold out.  You cannot advertise having gluten free or other flavors on your menu if you don't have them."}
{"text":"I think that I was so excited to try this place, that my expectations were crazy high.  The shop is nice and spacious, cool artwork on the walls.  I think it's in a great location and has many innovative ideas.  I tried the everything donut, which was tasty.  The texture of the donut was a little bit lacking in consistently, or almost too soft.  The cream cheese sweetness along with the toppings were good-excellent idea for a donut. I will go back to try other flavors because I think there is a lot of potential.  I wasn't disappointed, just expected something a little different."}
{"text":"Went for the first time after hearing a lot of great thugs and was so disappointed :( $13 for 4 donuts and each one was very dry and so dense needed a drink after every bite. Over priced and under delivered"}
{"text":"They just don't throw toppings on top and say here you go. Every doughnut is created to to taste amazing. Glaze and icing is not too sweet like some places. I tried the maple bacon and was expecting the maple to be overpowering and the bacon to be just an addition - I was wrong. All the flavors worked great together and had depth. Also had peanut butter and chocolate and the quality of flavor was really good. The peanut butter was delicious and not cheap like other experiences. The base doughnut flavor was very good too. You could taste egg and it was not too light and not too heavy. Their selections are small, 7-8 options but I think that's good because it doesn't get out of hand, items stay fresh because their created in small batches. You pay a little more for these than other places, but if you want something dessert quality, this is your place. I went two days in a row!"}
{"text":"We went on a recent Sunday morning. The menu looked awesome, however, they were sold out of most flavors (which was crazy because we got there pretty early). That being said, the doughnuts we got (chocolate dipped with sprinkles and glazed vanilla) were good. They weren't the flavors either of us would have originally picked, but they were fresh and tasty. Hopefully next time we will be lucky and get there when they have more flavors available."}
{"text":"Fresh donuts with a great variety. Their berries and creme donuts were excellent filled with fresh berries and a light creme. All their donuts I have tried are mouth watering and their rotating specials always on point.

The people behind the counter are also great and treat you with great care."}
{"text":"Joe's does donuts right. If you don't believe me look at their social media pages. They will flood your Instagram feed with mouth watering pictures of donuts that will make you want to stop by as soon as you can. Joe's is a popular place, though I've never experienced a line, be aware that they can get busy and sometimes even sell out of donuts some days. 

They have a great shop where you can have a seat and enjoy your donuts and coffee. They have superb coffee selections as well. Supplied by another local company! 

The donuts of the day will be displayed by the counter so it's easy to make your pick. But who can choose just one?? They have great hours on the weekends and are located right next to an arcade bar (Abari) so you can pretty much plan a whole night out right here. 

My only criticism is this. We picked up a dozen of donuts for my girlfriends birthday and we took the donuts out to the beach with us. We had a couple on the way down and they were delicious. When we arrived at the house however the cardboard box they were in showed signs of excess grease. That's expected because these are a fried food and you fry them in oil. That's all fine but when we started eating the donuts again the taste of cardboard was ever present in each bite. So we moved them out of the box supplied by Joes and into some plastic Glad storage containers. 

This can easily be fixed for Joe's by simply changing the packaging that the donuts come in, perhaps not using pizza boxes and using something along the lines that Krispy Kreme uses. Or by using precut parchment papers as a liner on the bottom of the boxes. 

Thanks for reading my review folks. I love Joe's doughs and I will gladly stop in when I'm in the area because their donuts are great!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite donut place in Charlotte. Their donuts are light and fluffy. I wish they were served warm, but they have a microwave which helps. Their flavors are incredibly unique and absolutely delicious. My absolute favorite was the strawberry cheesecake and the goat cheese strawberry balsamic."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a few times while checking out Abari nextdoor, but I have never managed to make a stop. Saw they had a Groupon and decided why not? 

The place is industrial chic with cement floors, exposed wood and metal.  The staff was beyond friendly! Mentioned to the guy that it was my first time and he threw in an extra donut for free. Ended up trying the sweet potato and the salted caramel donut and a latte. Let me say the latte was amazing.

 The donuts were good, but not exactly what I was expecting, coyingly sweet. My issue with the sweetness is probably more my problem than Joe's, but just know the treats will be very sweet. Next time I'll be sure to ask them if they have an option with less sugar."}
{"text":"Great donuts. Very creative concepts and very good. I've been known to eat 4 donuts at a time because they are that good."}
{"text":"Top notch donuts.  The old fashioned style reminds this 40-something what donuts tasted like when he was a kid."}
{"text":"Overrated and over priced. I think your paying for the box, because the donuts weren't anything special."}
{"text":"If you call Charlotte home and have yet to try one of Joe's famous doughnuts, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Crawl out from under that rock and get there.  Now.  Go on!  What are you waiting for?!?!  Go get your doughnut!

Seriously some of the best doughnuts on the planet!  Fresh made, unique creations that are locally rooted here in the QC!  I am a proud supporter of Joe's, and many other local grassroots businesses that call Charlotte home.  Joe and his team have built this business pop-up style, and have officially moved into their permanent brick and mortar location on Davidson Street in NoDa after a year of bouncing around the city establishing their cult following.  

Some of their fresh, rotating flavors include strawberry champagne, vanilla, candied lemon, strawberry goat cheese, basil, maple bacon, traditional sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles, and so many more!  Out of this world deliciousness!  

These guys have worked hard to build their following and this will prove to keep their new store successful.  Stop in and watch them working in the kitchen.  Grab your doughnuts to go, or sit inside and grab a cup of Enderly coffee.  Chances are I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"I drove from Concord to try this place out.  It was well worth the drive.  Joey has very nice place and a great product.  The place is really clean.  You can see back to where the donuts are created and everything is tidy. The donuts are great.  They have a daily assortment that ranges from basic glazed to very creative.  If you follow them on Facebook you can preview their daily menu.  His prices are very reasonable.  Clean, affordable, and delicious!"}
{"text":"OK LOOK. I hate donuts. I'm not really a fan of sweet things in general. Mostly, sweet things make me sick to my stomach. 

But there's a reason that they're sometimes sold out  (not that I've ever run into any problems with that, personally). My boss started getting these for us in the morning when she drops her dogs off at the bark and board nearby. 

You guys. These donuts are divine. I have become a convert of and worship at the altar of the maple bacon donut. Join me brethren."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE this place! Jasmine is always super friendly and very helpful. The donuts are always fresh and delightfully delicious."}
{"text":"These doughnuts are soft, fluffy and straight up delicious.  I mean I don't even like peanut butter and I murdered the peanut butter s'mores one! Best treat and super light so I don't even feel guilty about it!!!"}
{"text":"***This is an updated review of our second visit. Marked down to 3 stars....
Unfortunately our visit this time was not as pleasant as the last. We have 2 young children, and while we initially though the staff was very accommodating, we were left with a very poor taste in our mouth. We simply asked them to add sprinkles to a plain donut, what seemed so simple turned into a legitimate 5 minute discussion between the baker and cashier...basically the answer was no. 
For donuts to be $3 a pop, and still needing to perfect their donut recipe, it's pretty steep to not try to make the customer happy- especially ones that spend $20 each visit. 
The donuts were good- not great- and definitely not enough to compensate for making us feel uncomfortable when all we wanted was to have a fun Sunday morning with our family.
I can respect their concept, but when they are too strict with their rules, they take the fun out of eating a donut. 
I'm not saying this is the last time we will be coming here, but the extra 5 minute drive to Duck Donuts feels more than worth it. 


1st review....4 stars....Great, friendly staff... Smells amazing right when you walk in. 
This being our first experience, we didn't realize that you could only choose their donuts that were displayed. Going there with young children can be a challenge in that aspect- but again, the staff being so friendly did their best to accommodate with sprinkles. 
I will say they had a fun blow up seat and coloring galore that the kids went crazy for! 
For the donuts.... The vanilla glaze was magical, seriously so good and the size of the donuts is very impressive. The Everything donut.... OMG one of the best we ever had (which is why we are bummed we can only get that when the flavor is available) 
I had the candied lemon donut and the topping was outrageous... However, the donut itself was so greasy it literally dripped when I would bite into it. I got a tummy ache :( 
The kids had the chocolate glaze with sprinkles- and no one wanted to finish it. We went for another vanilla. 
All in all, it was a very happy beginning to a Sunday for our family, and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"In the land of Dunkin - thank you for Joe's! These are very good artisan donuts! They have the 'different' donuts to try as well as solid 'traditional' options. There is not a massive amount of variety compared to traditional donut places but with 9 options - you are covered!
Only negative was, the blueberry donut holes were dry - but the normal size donuts were awesome! 

Great donuts! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts made in house, in Charlotte. They know how to make the classics well and also keep it interesting with new flavors. Love how this place is growing and getting better with time! When we have a donut craving, Joe's is one of our top choices!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmy!! I'm not sure which doughnut is my favorite! Peanut butter and jelly, maple bacon, s'mores, the list goes on! Joe's Doughs are so light and airy, it's like biting into a pillow of goodness. And I love the creativity of the flavors, they are always trying something new and delicious. I can't wait for the shop to open this month!"}
{"text":"I've heard such good things about Joe's throughout the Queen City. I tried my best to visit on opening day, but couldn't make the wait in line. Finally for the long 4th weekend, We made our way to Joe's. No line, No wait, just doughnut perfection. I really loved the inside, the staff was friendly. I'm hoping Joe's will help bring more business to this area.

On to the donuts, Not being able to pick just a few we got 6... When in Rome. Fun flavors, large donuts, a little chewy. I liked these, but I wanted to love them. We tried the Vanilla, Espresso, Sprinkled and Salted Caramel.. The donuts consistency were very doughy and a little chewy, not your typical texture of  donuts. With that said, I liked it, just different and worth a try.  I hope Joe's becomes a NoDa staple, Amélie's needs some good bakery competition.."}
{"text":"I have been waiting anxiously to try Joe's Doughs for some time now. It seemed every pop up they had I was working so I had to wait for the store front to open. 
I went in around 12/12:30 on Thursday and they had quite a few donuts to choose from. I was super happy to see that one of them was the everything donut as this was one I had been dying to try! I limited myself to two donuts (even though I wanted to try them all) and ordered a maple bacon donut too. 
My mouth is watering thinking about that everything donut. It is aaaaamaizng. I love the sweet/savory aspect. 
Also the donut itself was perfection. I could eat a plain glazed one and be in heaven. 
All in all it was worth the wait and I can't wait to go back!
Also want to add how sweet the staff is! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Not that good. So disappointed. I was really hoping for a good neighborhood doughnut shop that served up proper doughnuts and fritters not champagne and bacon top doughs. This model would probably work in Ballantyne."}
