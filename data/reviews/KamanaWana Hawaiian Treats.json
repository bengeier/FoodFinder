{"text":"Kevin and debra are the best. I've  had the patia bowl and a lot of the Hawaiian ice flavors and iced coffee is my favorite!  I can't go enough I know  they need Sunday off but I'd go if they were open.  My favorite flavor is melon it tastes like honey dew"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  A very friendly and Awesome place for a refreshing dessert !"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Authentic Hawaiian shave ice, with friendly owners and it is  reasonably priced. My daughter has a list of all of the flavors and checks them off as she tries them. Super fun for families and a free large (as big as your head) size on your birthday."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and so glad we found it. The flavors are amazing and don't taste artificial.  Staff is always delightful and entertaining.  One day we stopped by before it was open and he still served us. Great product and service."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful and fantastic! We drove quite a bit out of the way to try this place and it was worth it! Although a few flavors were sold out, the two gentlemen behind the counter were so helpful and friendly. We weren't sure what flavors to try (being from out of town) and the staff were so nice, giving us their recommendations and letting us try the ones we weren't sure about. It was such a great experience with high-quality service and the taste was awesome! We can't wait to travel back there someday to try even more flavors."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just got home from an anniversary celebration trip in Hawaii and we were missing the local flavors of the island; found this little spot and for a moment were transported back to paradise. Authentic and friendly....  Mahalo"}
{"text":"Just the best! I got a shaved ice with ice cream Coconut and Lei Hing Mui flavor, and if course top it off with Lei Hing powder- authentic to Hawaii and a place I will go out of my way to enjoy. Kevin is super nice and I am happy to support this business!"}
{"text":"It was exactly like Kauai with snow cap and ice cream, highly recommend! And you can't beat the price! The owners are extremely nice and even give you samples to try to help decide BC they have lots of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian shave ice in the valley, Kevin(owner) is very nice and is passionate about the product that he provides. I highly recommend honeymoon flavor for the shave ice, and it is a MUST to have it with ice cream and the snowcap on top to finish!"}
{"text":"I have read all the reviews and I wish I had the same experience as everybody else. The owner was kinda rude to my wife and I and he acted like he was doing us a favor by serving us. I have had great shave ice on Oahu and this is not the same. This is basically a slush in a cup and not the wonderful light and fluffy shave ice I was hoping for. Maybe they were having a bad day so I gave them two more tries and nope it was the same crunchy ice slush as before. The attitude was a little better the second and third time around.  I think the owner needs to sharpen the blade on his machine or set it to shave a little finer. The machine he uses is the same machine they use in Hawaii so that's not the problem. On my final visit I overheard the owner say he was not using his \"regular\" ice, yet he was still selling a product he knew was not up to par. I'm still on the lookout for that authentic shave ice experience here on the mainland."}
{"text":"Their ice cream shop is great. Their Hawaiian ice cream is unique and delicious and the couple who sell it are sweet and relaxed. They really want to make sure you get what you like. Highly recommend you to try their honeymoon syrup on the slush and on top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I went to Kamana 'Wana for the first time today and it was an awesome experience! The owner was very friendly and passionate about the ice. It is the best shave ice I have ever had. Way better than Bahama Buck's. Also, the prices can't be beat. I will be back with my friends and family."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic hawaiian shaved ice then this is the place. Owner is super friendly and will help you pick a great flavor. I get the honeymoon with a snow cap (drizzled sweetened condensed milk on top) you can get it with ice cream too. Its like actual snow, not like any other place in the valley."}
{"text":"I like ice a lot owner is friendly and there's not a long wait time for your shaved ice. There's a ton of flavors to pick from as well !"}
{"text":"Having a pregnancy craving my husband and I stopped by after seeing the reviews on yelp. So glad we stopped! The owner was super nice. We had the watermelon and piña colada. Try the powder it is pretty tasty! Can t want to go back and try a different flavor."}
{"text":"Great locally owned shop and the Pitaya bowls taste as good as they look! Service was kind of slow because only the owner was working, but it was worth the wait! He also offered free samples to make up for the wait."}
{"text":"What a great place to just enjoy a special treat from back home. Loved it!!! Must bring everyone I know here!! Did I mention even in the rain the place was packed!"}
{"text":"First time I and a group of friends came here and it was delicious! They offered us samples to and tge service was GREAT!!! I highly recommend the apple colada and margarita as well as the bison berry. The pitaya bowls ate delicious as well and I suggest trying their unique flavors"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Arizona from home (Hawaii) and I was looking all over the place for authentic shave ice. The other day I came here to try it out and I was throughly impressed. The owner was super funny and even let us try a flavor we've never tasted before. The place had a very local vibe with local music playing and I truly felt at home. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fun place. The staff are friendly and they have shaved ice with acai or dragon fruit and the toppings can be changed. A little on pricey side"}
{"text":"Excellent shaved ice, great prices, friendly staff. Got the honeymoon flavor with ice cream at the bottom and snow cap on top. Soooo good! I recommend it. There are lots of flavors and add ons to choose from.  This will definitely be a frequent stop for me."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Very friendly and a huge selection.  Had the honey moon flavor with double ice cream, coconut,  and Li Hing Mui and a snow cap. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sooo so delicious. Yelp led me to this gem & wow I'm amazed. I really didn't know if it were going to be real Hawaiian kine shave ice (it was!) so happy we went & checked it out. Being from Hawaii, I was so excited to see all my favorite flavors and add ins (mochi, ice cream, & azuki beans) but, keep in mind, if you want the beans, call ahead because he doesn't always have them made. I got tigers blood & piña colada & it made a great combo. 

The owner, Kevin was so friendly & genuine. I like the passion he has for this little shop. Can't wait to go back! I'm already anticipating the flavors I'm going to get next time!

Aloha!"}
{"text":"Authentic!  They don't have the ice cream (for the middle) yet, but they are working on it. Prices are extremely reasonable (they have large portions) and the syrups they use are all imported from Hawai'i. The owners are absolutely lovely and happy to help."}
{"text":"I just love this neighborhood hawaiiAn ice place! Kevin the owner is fun and friendly and constantly joking with customerS and spreading joy! His shaved ice are fabulous and they have so many unique flavor options! I love the Li Hing Mui, flown in from Hawaii! The entire atmosphere is Hawaiian and beautifully painted! In fact the treats Kevin and his small crew make are authentic to Hawaii and Kevin has told the story of growing up with them, living in Hawaii. The overall experience is fun and your taste buds have experienced nothing like this sweet snow that melts in your mouth! Be sure to get the snow cap of sweetened condensed milk! Oh it is the cherry on top! Oh and they have coffee and pitaya bowls that look delicious! And on top of all these wonderful things, the prices are very reasonable! I love this place and will be back! Again and again!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the delicious treats here! The ice cream in the bottom of the shaved ice is a must! Each bite is better than the last!"}
{"text":"The owners are the nicest people I have met in phoenix, so friendly and informative!!!! Shaved ice was a new experience for my husband and I, the lady helped us with samples and gave us full explanations of all the products. In the end we opted for (I cannot remember the name of it) but it was a smoothie mixture with dragon fruit and then granola blueberries and slices banana on top which was absolutely Devine! All in all great experience, felt so welcome."}
{"text":"Best shaved ice place I've been to. I recommend it to many friends. Great customer service with a wide variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Love this place. We drove from the far west side to try it, was well worth the drive. This is a nice little shop. Clean and friendly. Love the dragon's blood and honeymoon flavors."}
{"text":"My sister insisted on bringing me here one day and I was thinking \"It's just a snowcone, what's the big deal\"

But this place is awesome! There are sooooooo many flavors and I got cotton candy and you can have ice cream in your shaved ice....which makes it BOMB. You can also get a \"snow cap\" which is sweet condensed milk on top....easy to pass by if your not looking out for it though!

Will definitely come here again.

Also, do not call it a snowcone, call it shaved ice....the guy will get angry haha"}
{"text":"Loved this spot! We were looking for a little dessert and stumbled on this place! We will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Great treat and no matter the size you order, the serving portion is huge! Awesome customer service and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor selection. Super friendly service--they even put a birthday candle in my Son's shaved ice and sang to him when they found out it was his birthday the next day. The Margarita and Mai tai flavors were so good!we will be back when we need another dose of paradise."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best shaved ice I have ever tried! The owner, Kevin, recommended we have a scoop of vanilla ice cream under the shaved ice then top it off with creme. I had the berry plum flavor and my husband and son had the honeymoon flavor. This will now be our favorite place to go for a treat!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great find in the corner of 19th and Thunderbird! The staff was incredibly friendly and food was delicious! I got the Tropical Bowl, which was fresh and a large helping and my girlfriend got a Blue Dragon smoothie. They definitely earned two new regulars."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing!!  My daughter and I got shaved ice with ice cream and my husband and son got smoothies. Everything was soooo good and the owner was super friendly!!  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious treat!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Owner (Kevin) is nice and is from Hawaii, he knows his stuff. He has a passion for his work and where he comes from. Prices are really good for what you get. He let me try samples of the flavors for the shave ice (like little miniature shave ice) which he makes every week made from cane sugar. I tried eight different flavors and loved them all. My husband had a frappe and loves it. We share a Hula Bowl which is crazy good. I had a shave ice which was good as well, the way he does the shave ice is awesome something that no other place does. Its not a snow cone, it's shave ice there's a big difference between the two, makes it where you don't want snow cones anymore. There is a huge list of flavors you can get on your shave ice including \"Dill Pickle\". There's this cream stuff that he puts on shave ice and it's amazing, as well as the Li Hing Powder I put that all over my shave ice."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my joyous finds in this city.  LOVE the shave ice, the coffee is always good, haven't tried the bowls yet, also Kevin and Deborah.  Fun and always a treat.  Thanks for keeping my family and I cool in the scorching valley!!"}
{"text":"Was craving something sweet & wanted to try something new, I've been picky since just becoming pregnant but I couldn't have been happier with this place! I got a melona & lychee with ice cream, mochi, & condensed milk. I don't even want to try any other flavors because I feel like that was the best combo in the world! The place had a line to the door only 30 minutes before closing & the owner was in there by himself & had the best give you shit humor!! Also think this place is almost too cheap! We paid $8 for two smalls with toppings you can't beat that! He should definetly charge for ever add on  & should up the price to $1.00 for ice cream people would pay more for this no problem because it's that goood!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Pitaya bowl, so delicious! I've been there 3 times now & will definitely be back. Everyone that works there is super friendly, haven't had one bad experience there. Try the bowls they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Today after a quick search on Yelp for somewhere to have a cold treat, i came across this shop that has amazing reviews for Hawaiian shaved ice. Curious and wanting to give something new a try,I decided to make the short trip and give it a whirl. For a nice change of pace, it was an excellent decision.
First off I can say that Kevin, the owner of the shop, is an incredibly kind gentleman who comes from Hawaii and grew up having these sorts of treats he sells now. By far this is nothing like a snow cone that you have ever tried. The flavors available, which are in the dozens and are made by hand weekly by Kevin, are all incredible. I sampled several and couldn't find one that I even slightly disliked. The portions are generous, and very reasonable given the low prices. For a Hawaiian spin, you can have a scoop of ice cream added inside your shaved ice to further the amazing taste and experience. If you come just for yourself or to get a cool treat with the kids, everyone is going to leave happy and thinking of what you will try next visit.
Not only do they offer shaved ice. but they also carry a variety of hot coffee, mochas, lattes, and frappes. There are a selection of smoothies to try along with a fruit bowl of sorts. I was able to try out the Hula Bowl, which offered fresh strawberries, cocoa nibs, sliced almonds, bananas, all on a chilled puree of pitaya(dragonfruit) and topped with honey. I was far and away amazed. It truly felt that I could order anything from here and it would be delicious."}
{"text":"Owner was so friendly,  he let us sample all his favorite flavors.  The shaved ice and ice cream was delicious!"}
{"text":"So impressed! The girlfriend and I wanted a shaved ice and pulled this place up on yelp, the neighborhood is little on the rough side, but couldn't have been more impressed! The staff was SO nice and helpful. They walked us through flavors (with samples) and told us all about traditional Hawaiian shaved ice. These sweet treats are beyond comparison with normal shaved ice places! I highly recommend the flavor \"honeymoon\" and be sure to get it \"snow capped\" and with ice cream! 

It's been 2 days since we went here and I'm still dreaming of it!"}
{"text":"Yum! Found this place on yelp! Really enjoy coming to this place with the family. Their flavors are true to their name...well except tigers blood :) whatever you try...get it snow-capped. Its a small place, seating is limited--they can make it to go too. Worth the wait when it's busy. Plus side for me--real friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We just moved here from Southern California and this reminds us of home! So many amazing flavors! If you like honeydew, you're gonna love Melona. Owner Kevin is so sweet and feels like my long lost uncle lol We will definitely be here all the time"}
{"text":"This is my top choice for shaved ice in Phoenix! The quality of ice and the homemade flavors make this place awesome. The only thing thats missing is fresh fruit! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Such a perfect place to cure that sweet tooth craving.  Been here a few times and every flavor I've tried so far has been so good. My plan is to try a different flavor every time but they have such a large selection it may take a while. Owners are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Reminded me so much of hawaiian shaved ice from hawaii!! Definitely will be coming back! Boyfriend and I ordered the POG, honeymoon, and guava flavors with ice cream and snow cap!"}
{"text":"So happy I tried this place after seeing it on Yelp.  Very delicious and the service was great. Will recommend to everyone I know and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is authentic Hawaiian shave ice, and you feel like you're on the island! The prices here are incredible, and you can get snow cap, mochi, and Li hing mui for free. The workers are so friendly and nice! It is a place that you must visit!"}
{"text":"Perfection in a styrofoam cup!

I selected a regular half (blue!) Vanilla, half Wedding Cake shave ice with ice cream, mochi, and a snow cap (condensed milk on top).  It was amazing, and definitely REAL Hawaiian shave ice.

Bonus points for not using those horrible wooden spatula spoons some places use, but having decent plastic ones.

The owners were extremely friendly, and they're \"locals\" from Hawaii too!  Their ingredients/syrups all come from Honolulu.  They mentioned that they do private parties, events, and fundraisers too.  I was also offered a sample of any other flavors they had, but I was far too into devouring my creamy vanilla cake concoction to take them up on it today.

I will definitely be back!  Note that they're prices are HALF of Snoh on Camelback's, with the trade off being less atmosphere (it's very plain inside) and less deluxe toppings.  Snoh's flavor-infused ice is also more \"sticky\" and \"fluffy\" while K's has a better bite/chew/texture to it, and has much more flavor thanks to the generous use of syrup!"}
{"text":"I love this place so many flavors for The Shave Ice so it's so fluffy and Light it instantly melts away the dragon fruit thing was good as well like the smooth texture of it super friendly people willing to explain everything about their menu even gave me a few samples of ice The Taste flavor I wanted awesome place will be back soon as I can sounds like next time I go hiking"}
{"text":"Owner was really cheerful and gave us a bunch of free samples as it was our first time. Every flavor I tried was delicious so it was hard to make a decision. Really good customer service, cheap prices, huge portion size, and delicious flavors! Not only that, but the Hawaiian atmosphere was a really nice touch that just added to the experience overall. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a great place to takes the kids and very Cheap. They serve shaved ice.The staff is very friendly and have many flavors to choose from. It is cash only. They also offer authentic hawaiian treats. Nice and clean. Its is locally ran and owned. Also noticed on their Facebook page they did some charity work too. 7 people and the bill was like 15$. Never realized the difference between shaved ice and snow cones until now. Shaved ice is better for sure. I love the texture of it!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I lived in Hawaii for a long time and this place is so damn close too Matsumoto's in Hawaii. Owner is very friendly and funny. I will be back here many many times."}
{"text":"Had shaved ice in CA, and had to find one here in AZ. I've been to another franchise, and while they were good as well, KamanaWana took it to a whole new level. Owners are very friendly, and from Hawaii. They treat you like family and have a wide variety of flavors. Have gone twice, and both were great experiences. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Funny personable owner , the most authentic Hawaiian frozen treats in town! You gotta get the SHAVED ICE with snow ! We have been going here for the last 3 years and will continue to spread the word! The syrups he uses are from Hawaii and you will taste the difference! a go to place for hot summer days or even cold winter nights ."}
{"text":"Excellent place and highly recommend! Wonderful personal customer service! Super friendly and endless selections and flavors! You owe it to yourself to check this place out!"}
{"text":"A great dessert for a hot Arizona day!  For their shaved ice, you had an option of with or without an ice cream center, up to 3 flavors, and the option of condensed milk drizzled on top, (affectionately called the snow cap).  There are so many flavors, and it would take multiple visits to try them all! Their pitaya and acai bowls were also great, and you could choose from multiple bases: apple juice, coconut water, and cactus water. The owner/staff was generally friendly when talking to us, but he may come across as a bit aggressive, as we heard him tell another group \"no outside food or drinks\" since \"the store also sells drinks.\"  Despite this, the place is worth the visit for their amazing desserts and variety of flavors!"}
{"text":"I've searched high and low all over Phoenix for *real* Hawaiian shave ice and I cannot count the number of times I've been disappointed by what amounted to snow cones. Now that I've found this place though I shall search no more!

Delicious shave ice, tons of flavor options and great customer service to boot. I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is delish! Definitely reminds me of getting a shaved ice in Hawaii. It's legit and definitely worth it! The owner was super friendly, helpful and you can tell he loves what he does. Overall, it was a great experience, great price, great menu, and my family and I cannot wait to go back for this special Hawaiian treat  Yum!"}
{"text":"Authentic  Hawaiian shaved ice! Great price! Local owned! A large variety of flavors, pitaya bowls and iced coffee's."}
{"text":"A paradise in a seemingly hole in the wall place. I got the tropical pitaya bowl, pretty much amazing in a huge cup! The owner and staff are both extremely friendly and welcoming! So glad to have found this thanks to the other reviews. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place SO much! They definitely got me hooked! The prices are super reasonable and affordable. When I went I got to sample many different flavors before choosing what I wanted. You get a TON of shaved ice for the price and ice cream on the bottom is only 50c more! This stuff is the real Hawaiian deal and I'll never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pitaya bowls!!!! It's our regular spot now when we're in the area. Unfortunately, there's nothing like this traditional Hawaiian in South Phoenix or  Maricopa."}
{"text":"Jeff and I LOVE this place! The owners are always happy to see us, the flavor selection is unreal, and so are the different items they offer. We are hooked on this place!"}
{"text":"Nice chill place...owners are really nice ...very good won't break ur wallet...will recommend this spot"}
{"text":"The shaved ice was great! I got blue raspberry and bubble gum (yes, I'm basically a two year old) and it was a huge portion. However, lack of signage left me wandering around the neighborhood trying to find the location and, when I finally got there, the wait was tremendous (even though there was no one queued in front of me). Perhaps he was short handed, but it seemed to take forever to make the tasty treats."}
{"text":"Delicious and very much like what you would get in Hawaii! Owner is very friendly and passionate about his business! We will be back again!!! Also, there are TONS of flavors, like 50+"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Underpriced (great for young families with kids) for what you get-I would never say that a company should raise their prices, but they actually should."}
{"text":"My daughter \"First time\" Hawaiian ice! Can say enough about the quality and the genuine attention to quality!"}
{"text":"Amazing shaved ice!!!!!! The owners are friendly and very helpful. The even offer samples if you want to try any of the flavors! I've never had shaved ice that tastes this good!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and it was amazing, probably the best shaved ice I've had in the valley by far. The owner was very cool the service was very good. We both got shaved ice with a snow cap come which is like a sweet condensed milk topping and which I recommend, the owner told me next time I should try it with ice cream, he said that is the real Hawaiian Way, so next time I will definitely take him up on that offer. while we were sitting there eating our shave ice there 4 kids there eating but only 2 bought shave ice, the owner asked them if they were just not hungry or what,  and the 2 said they were out of money, he said don't worry about it and he gave them both thier favorite shave ice flavors. That was so cool of him to do that, my kind of owner for sure, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  I have never had shaved ice with ice cream before and I was a little skeptical..... silly me, it was amazing!  They have so many varieties you can truly pick your flavor of the moment and they will have it to add to a delicious treat.
The family shared one with apricot and you can't help but push a little when it is your turn to get a scoop from the dish!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for an açaí bowl and to my surprise they have pitaya as well, which I enjoy even more than açaí. Got the tropical bowl. It's is INCREDIBLE! The owner is super nice too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and these treats are the real deal. Totally authentic Hawaiian shaved ice!! They even have the ice cream inside the shaved ice and the condensed milk over the top, called snow cap. I'm asian so the flavors I've gotten are lychee, passion fruit, li hing mui, tamarind. I actually love the li hing mui with li hing powder in the shaker can. That's the best!! My nephew has gotten cherry cola, pickles, root beer, blood orange and dragon blood. It all tastes exactly the flavor it should. The couple who runs the place are super nice and funny. My brother in law found this gem and we just wish it was closer to us so we can go more often."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident, but so glad we did! Don't let the outside appearance fool you-this place is truly a diamond in the rough! Walking in, the menu was a bit overwhelming because of all of the choices - it has everything! Kevin, the owner, was so kind and patient. After seeing we couldn't make a decision, he laid out 6 different sAmples for us! He explained how he gets all his flavors from back home in Hawaii.  I ended up with the coconut and vanilla shaved ice with ice cream and sno cap and HOLY MOLY, it's the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try the açaí bowls and smoothies."}
{"text":"Great place for shaved ice! Pineapple with ice cream was reminiscent of a Dole Whip, and the other flavors my family got were all great as well. The owner was nice enough to give us several samples when I was having a hard time deciding what to order, and the other employee helping us was extremely friendly as well. This will be a new favorite - especially during the hot Phoenix summer months!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Everything I've tried here has been very tasty! I recommend getting the ice cream at the bottom and \"snow capped\" which means they cover it with condensed milk at the top. They will let you try several flavors and give you samples but it's very hard to choose from all the great flavors. I love the dragons blood, Tigers blood and cherimoya! The owner is usually there and is very witty and pleasure to be around! His nephew is usually there and is also great! I have brought my whole family and a few friends and they all love it as much as me. The prices are also great!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night after finding it on Yelp! and we will definitely be back! Appears to be a mom and pop shop which we love, supporting local business keeps our community thriving!
On the suggestion of someone else's review, we tried the tiger's blood and piña colada shaved ice with ice cream, strawberry mochi and topped with a snow cap (condensed milk)! It was amazing!
We went at about 8:30 on a Saturday night and the place was super busy, it took awhile to get the bowl we ordered, but it was worth the wait! 
Definitely want to try some other flavors as well as try the dragon fruit bowl!!"}
{"text":"Best staff ever: brought our daughter for her first ice; they were helpful, patient and just as excited as we were. Great options, great flavors. Family run."}
{"text":"Just like home. Kevin does a great job of capturing the flavors of the islands. A must try spot. Double ice cream and mochi! Will definitely be making this a frequent stopping place for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"What horrible customer service. Threw a fit and yelled at me for having my reusable water bottle with me. I don't buy or use plastic bottles. Owner who sees me come a couple times a week always with a handful of people totally was rude in front of my wife and kids. I would never ever visit this place. And I will make sure nobody I know ever comes here. 


When he opened up I was Raving about it. Even Gave him my Hawaii license plate to use as decoration in his store. 


Never again. I've never felt so disrespected."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the corner of a little shopping square, but they're a hidden treasure! The people working there are SO nice, it feels like you're in a little slice of Hawaii, and the Hawaiian I've with creamy vanilla ice cream on the bottom is the perfect summer treat!
Something about Hawaii Ice is so much better than just a plain snow cone or something. It's light and fluffy and cold.
I'll definitely be coming back often to beat the summer heat."}
{"text":"I have never received such horrible service. Today was my first time coming here with all my friends. I had just spent money at Starbucks so I wasn't sure yet if I was going to order something for me and my boyfriend. After maybe 10 minutes I got in line and decided that I could afford it. Well after I was standing in line for 20 minutes (I swear that's not an exaggeration, I was counting) my boyfriend stands up and asks me if I paid yet, just because I hadn't been back to the table. I just shook my head no, and I think he could tell I was a little irritated. Then the man behind the counter started yelling at him. No joke. He said that it was STUPID of us to have waited so long to order, and mumbled other things about our decision to wait to order. I decided to give him 5 more minutes to take my order, and then I would leave. 6 minutes passed, and then he proceeded to yell at me. He told me that when I come in a big group like that (it was 6 people) that I need to order right away because if I wait to order then he has to allow my friends to stay at the table for 30 more minutes, and told me that was why he was MAKING me wait. So not only was I waiting, but there was an old couple and about 4 teenagers behind me getting irritated too. I wonder if he realized that by making me wait 30 minutes before he took my order...my friends were still occupying the table?? I understand his frustration, but if he just took my order right away and then maybe asked us to eat outside we would have been a lot more understanding. I would give this establishment negative starts if I could. Yes, the prices are pretty reasonable. But I would be willing to pay a few dollars more for even mediocre customer service. Don't waste your money, or your time here."}
{"text":"I give their food a 5 and their service a 0. Went in with 3 friends to try out their shaved ice. At first the owner was very nice but soon he along with a woman who worked their made it very uncomfortable for my friends and I. My phone was very low on battery and I saw an outlet so I decided to charge it . The man working told me that if I wasn't ordering anything I had to pay him a dollar for charging my phone. I completely understood and unplugged it. On the other hand my friends (who bought two items) felt they could charge their phone since they purchased something. I mean he did said it was okay. A little over 2 minutes later a woman came out and kept looking at our table making it uncomfortable , we just felt very weird like we were doing something wrong . My friend went to the bathroom & the woman walked over took her chair away and look at the phone plugged in . There were 2 extra chairs but she took the one my friend was sitting on. When my friend returned she grabbed a nearby chair and the lady came over and said \"were running low on chairs so use the chair on the other side of the table\" & then proceeded to charge her a dollar for charging her phone, after they told her she could. All in all it was a an unwelcoming experience & we won't be back . It's sad since their shaved ice is so good."}
{"text":"Went there with my family after hearing nothing but good things.

First off, let me say that the place was clean and everything we ordered was delicious.

However, the guy behind the counter could literally not have been ruder. We asked some questions and he barely answered. He looked and acted annoyed - and we were the only people in there. When we did get our items, he told my wife who was standing near the tables to sit down so she wouldn't make a mess. He then stopped what he was doing and demanded she take a napkin and my wife is not a slob by any means.

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm going on a 5 star yelp spree, but Arizona really deserves it.  This place serves up some really mean shaved ice!

Now, I've had finer, softer ices in my lifetime, but where this place wins is with their syrups.  I can't think of a single place that has better tasting, more accurate syrup flavorings.  Not California, not Hawaii, not anywhere.  The owner gave us his recommendations and let us try a sampling of his favorites.  I wish I could have tried his favorites before I ordered because those flavors were sooo good.  My favorites here are the Boysenberry and Honeymoon!!"}
{"text":"Short Version: Awesome. JUST like being in Hawaii. Got the Dragon Blood, Hawaiian Punch and POG with Sour Spray, Ice Cream on bottom and Extra Snow Cap. 

Long Version: I debated between 4 stars and 5 stars here because of the really long wait and The ONLY reason this didn't get 4 stars is because the owners are SUPER apologetic and accommodating. Granted, it was busy and there is only one person making the shave ice so it's understandable.

This place is a testament to exactly what solid, friendly service will do for a business. Patrons won't turn pissy for a long wait as long as the owners/employees acknowledge that there is a long wait, apologize and are friendly. So often do we go to restaurants now where the staff is pretentious and make you feel like you're lucky to be there (See: My \"The Mission\" Review). 

My nephew got little samples from the owner and shave ice maker in between him making it for other people. It's the little thoughtful things like that that keep customers happy and loyal.

You get to pick 3 flavors for your shave ice and optional additions are ice cream on the bottom and snow cap on top as well as a sour spray. The sour spray is pretty sour, so beware. We love sour so it was perfect. I love snow cap so I asked for extra. I wasn't disappointed. I just need to bring my own condensed milk next time.

I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"While on a quest to find a little taste of Hawaii (aka I was craving shave ice), I came across Kamana' Wana Hawaiian Treats... on Yelp... 'cause where else do you find what you need?!

When I pulled up to Kamana' Wana Hawaiian Treats, I realized that I had passed by a million times and didn't even notice it! (Quite disappointed in myself for not noticing it actually...) I went inside to the cute little shop, and was happily greeted by Kevin, the most kindhearted and helpful owner. 

Kevin was so awesome! We chatted for a bit, and then he rang up my order, and told me he'd let me sample a few flavors before I committed to the 3 I wanted (if you get more than 3, it turns into a mess!). I got a medium -- which I SHOULD have gotten the large shave ice, lol -- with a scoop of ice cream and also a snow cap (sweetened condensed milk drizzled on top). Then came the sampling... OMG! The flavors were all so amazingly delicious! Oh, and by the way, Kevin informed me that they make their flavors in-house and use natural cane sugar... none of that high fructose corn syrup yuck! And he's got some secret recipes, too! 

After sampling a bunch of flavors, I ended up getting Blue Hawaii, Li Hing Mui, and Coconut! All oh so good! I ended up taking my shave ice to-go... (yes, it's possible!) and rushed home to enjoy my frozen treat! I will definitely be back to get more shave ice soon, and try one of the pitaya bowls... and who can forget about the coffee! Aaah, Hawaii heaven!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  There is no other word to describe
What you are about to taste. I had the boysenberry flavor. I Highly recommend you get on down there."}
{"text":"Shaved ice is awesome! I've been looking for a Hawaiian shaved ice since the Hawaiian fair at Tempe. I love how they have so many flavors to choose from! Don't forget to add that ice cream! So good! Plus the owners are friendly. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic treat & great service always! My family loves coming here...one fave is a large with li hing mui, pog, & honeymoon with ice cream, strawberry mochi bits & a snow cap. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"After searching for a cool treat on a hot day we stumbled upon this gem. The owner, Kevin, went above and beyond to give us multiple samples, explained his product (his passion) and made us feel so welcome. The syrups are like nothing I've ever had, so sweet and fruity. They don't burn the back of your throat like the cheap sugary syrups and they don't dry out and leave you scooping hard, unflavored ice into your mouth. I also had the sour spray and snow cap. Both were divine! If your like sour patch kids, you'll love the spray. The prices are just dirt cheap. I'd pay double. Seriously. $4 total for two giant Hawaiian shaved ices plus toppings?!! We added ice cream to the bottom for an extra $0.50. I will definitely be back for more shaved ice and to try the cold-pressed coffee!"}
{"text":"I'm all about customer service and the guy (owner I think) behind the counter literally could not have been anymore rude. They close at 9pm and I arrived literally 5 mins before closing.. mind you it was my first time there and I was excited to try their Hawaiian shaved ice- I kindly asked the man what he recommended since it was my first time there.. he looked at me with a straight, annoyed face and responded with \"I recommend you come here way before 9pm but we have so many flavors\". Most unwelcoming experience ever.. I didn't even order anything after that. I looked at my boyfriend and told him \"na I don't want to order anything after all, worst customer service\"!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is Amazing.The owner and his nephew are wonderful  very friendly.
Treats are excellent very delicious! Great place to go with friends,family or a date;^)
Marley."}
{"text":"Such a delightful, little piece of Hawaii right here in Phoenix! The hawaiian ice with ice cream and \"snow capped\" with sweetened condensed milk was amazing. I had pjna colada and it was delicious and very cheap! 2.00 for a small size. The owner is so personable and nice! Many flavors!!"}
{"text":"I saw the rave reviews here on Yelp, figured this would be a can't miss, but boy was I wrong! The young man working up front was really cool but that's as good as the story gets for me here. The man that I assume was the owner was very rude to both my girlfriend and I. It took them over 20 minutes to make my shaved ice which was average at best, with WAAAY too much of that Chamoy sauce after I asked them for none of it in the first place! My first and last visit here thx."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are regular customer! :) we ate here countless time and will miss it a lot when we leave Phoenix :) 

We can't have enough of his shaved ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle! To name a few flavor We love li Hing mui, root beer, lychee, etc. we also love their pitaya bowl, especially the one w bee pollen! 
 The owner seem like a guy with the sweetest heart :)"}
{"text":"I have a very strong love hate relationship with this place......

      I work about 7 miles away from here in an office that has over 120 employees. About twice a week I send out a mass email asking for shaved ice orders and always come here to grab our yummy treats. EVERY SINGLE TIME I have been here the owner has been SO RUDE to me. I e been ignored for over 15 minutes before he would take my order when I was the only person in the establishment. Another time I asked for extra snow cap and was told \"No\", after I said that I was paying for it, he still told me no, and that he put enough on the shaved ice and I didn't need anymore. One time he was so rude and took over 40 minutes to take my order and make 5 shaved ice, again, I was the only person there, that I have him a $20 tip and told him to have a nice day, which he in return gave me a dirty look. I worked in the customer service industry as a bartender for 9 years as a bartender so I'm pretty understanding when it comes to service..... We all have our days, and you never know what jerk was in before you. But really???? Every single time I come in????? Especially when I bring you business every week?
          The issue is that the shaved ice is so stinkin good and one of my favorite treats! If you are looking for one of the best Hawaiian shaved ice around check this place out, but don't be offended when you get treated like crap. I will continue to come here weekly, but I'm thinking about making another co worker pick the order up because apparently he does not care for me.
         Shaved ice= 10 stars
         Customer service= 0"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the aloha pitaya bowl and it was so good. The owner and the young man working were very friendly. I told them it was my first time there so they gave me a few samples of their popular shaved ice flavors. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best shaved ice ever! Workers are so nice & even gave us samples of the flavors! Very cheap also!"}
{"text":"Friendly and genuine service. Best shaved ice I've had outside of Hawaii, and it was better than many of the shaved ice places we went while we were there. You will be able to taste the quality of the syrups. Very affordable and clean as well. We will definitely be returning frequently."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses and this one my go to places when I'm jonesin for some great shave ice. They have tons of flavors. My favorite is strawberry and POG with vanilla ice cream underneath. We loved them so much we had them cater my nephew's birthday party and they did a fantastic job. They served out more shave ice than what we paid for, meaning we got some free shave ice. When I tipped them for their service they were super appreciative since they didn't expect one. I hope they never move from this location since they are literally a stone throw away from my house. I do wish they were open on Sundays though!"}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian Ice I have ever had.  Been to all the other ice places in metro Phoenix and nothing compares.  All the flavors are so good.  Generous portions for a great price.  You will not be disappointed.   Been coming to this place for over a year."}
{"text":"Support a local business! This is as good as it gets. I close my eyes and imagine I'm in Hawai'i. Take me away! Tons of flavors that they import from the Islands. This is the real deal. Ice cream buried beneath my shaved ice? Yes please. Sno Cap? (sweetened condensed milk) Absolutely!  Ling Hing powder? Sure! Sign me up. Inexpensive, professional. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great cool treat in the Arizona heat! This place is honestly the BEST shaved ice I have ever had. They are experts at their craft. Can't wait to try an açaí bowl!"}
{"text":"OMG CHERIMOYA IS SO GOOD!! Love this place, great people working here, we will definitely be coming a lot more!"}
{"text":"The real deal. Just like in Hawaii. I often miss the shaved ice like on the North Shore. This place was amazing. Just like home. Melt in your mouth, not crunchie. Snow top with ice cream inside. The variety and quality of flavors are amazing! The owners were full of Aloha and welcoming like old friends. Really wished we lived in the area and didn't have to wait till our next vaca to the AZ to visit."}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden gems. I guarantee if you go there once, you will want to go there again. I have never liked snow cones and had never had true shave ice because of that. I am glad I read all of the Yelp reviews and decided to give this place a try. Our whole family had a wonderful experience trying flavors and finally deciding on our perfect choices. Lucky for us, many more flavors remain for us to try the next time. Kevin, the owner, is friendly and makes this place more than a mundane stop for a treat. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fresh flavors that don't just taste like sugar. Large portions and great prices. Service was excellent as well! We will be back."}
{"text":"Kevin is great and always hospitable to us and joking when we come in. We make a point to visit every time we are in town. My favorite is a coconut shave ice with ice cream and lei-hi-moi powder on top. 
This is truly the only shave ice place that has even come close to what I got in Hawaii. Kevin knows what is authentic because he is Hawaiian!"}
{"text":"The owners make this place special!! The shaved ice is unique and delicious! Plus the future plans sound exciting can't wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! My summer destination during these crazy Hot days!! They make shaved ice so super delicious!! Made them a painting to share the Joy they give to others every day!! Thanks Guys!!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere, and owner! The employee was super friendly. The pitaya bowl is amazing, and I can't wait to try other items!"}
{"text":"The owner of this place knows what he's doing.  I was mesmerized watchinghim craft ice in to perfect globes of snow. Clearly, he's had tons of practice, and cares that you receive an authentic shave ice. 

I ordered Hawaiian Punch, Pina Colada, and Dragons Blood with ice cream in the bottom and mochi. The melting ice mixed with the ice cream perfectly.  Who knew?  The mochi were buried deep within the snow,  so they didn't fall out when the ice melted.  Genius! 

My hubby ordered root beer with ice cream, and had his version of a root beer float.  Overall everything was perfect.  What an amazing find."}
{"text":"pitaya bowl!!!!!!!! super delicious!! %100 authentic!!! and the staff/owners are great!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have so many flavored the staff is so nice and it's inexpensive. It smells wonderful here also. They coffee smells awesome although I have yet to try it. I love this place it's very down to earth. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"3rd visit with in a month and love this place very authentic to what would you get in maui. But the price is better and the shaved ice is great. The owner is great to work with and provides suggestions."}
{"text":"This place is so great! The shaved ice is amazing and the staff here is so welcoming. I will definitely return as I live right across the street. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"The shaved ice is delicious! The owner let us try many sample flavors to help us choose since it was our first time. He was very friendly and talked with us while we are our dessert. We had the boysenberry and apricot shaved ice with ice cream in the inside. 
At first it was weird because it was empty on a Saturday night but worth it! Can't wait to come back and try the pitaya bowl!"}
{"text":"great staff, great prices, EXCELLENT taste! so many flavors to choose from. the perfect sweet treat for a hot arizona day!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place.... YUM. I'm super organic and non-sugar lifestyle and I'm always looking for yummy deserts when I'm craving the sugar! I seriously cannot wait to try the different bowls, other smoothies, and the AÇAÍ. Oh, AND THEY HAVE LOW ACIDITY COFFEE FRAPS? Yea just take all of my money"}
{"text":"Good reviews and 5 stars aren't enough for this place. My whole family loved it. The staff is very friendly and kind. You have to try it. My family will be regular customers now that we have been there."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience here today getting shave ice. 

It's a small establishment, and I'm glad I went when it was slow because I can only image how busy it gets when it's warm outside. 

The young man helping me was super funny and patient with me as i mulled over the vast choices on the menu. He even gave  me a few samples so I could try before I ordered. I finally settled on a yummy concoction and added ice cream and strawberry Mochi to the mix. 

Man oh man, when I tell you, this shave ice is super tasty! Now it's not as great as what I had when I lived in Hawaii and hit up the shade ice shop around the corner from my house in M?iliili, but it certainly took me back!

All in all fantastic service and great shave ice! I'll certainly be back this summer!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Saw this on yelp and decided to give it a try.  Staff was super friendly - could tell we were newbies and gave us some samples and a walkthrough of the flavors.  I'd say melona was the one I liked best, though there are too many to try them all in one go.  Ice cream at the bottom is a no-brainer, and it's a nice combo when it gets mashed up with the syrups."}
{"text":"The shaved ice is awesome!! the atmosphere is welcoming and the owners are very good to my kids!! they treat them like family!!! If you have never been in before I highly suggest you try the out!!! I recommend the Pitaya bowl is a must try!!! SUPER healthy!!"}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC Hawaiian shaved ice! Super cool like place with great personalized service. The owner is super friendly and will let you try flavors. Get the snow cap on whatever flavor you choose, trust me you don't regret it. My favorite is the honeymoon with a snow cap. Fantastic prices"}
{"text":"It's been hard finding an authentic hawaiian shaved ice in Phoenix. Well, this is the one! Good quality products will make a great shaved ice. Lots of flavors to chosee from and the cap is what makes it perfect."}
{"text":"This is a small mom and pop place.  They were swamped with a larger order prior to me placing an order.  I was took to take a seat and I will be told when we can order.  After 10 mins, when they were ready to take my order I was passed up by other customer.  OK, so I waited more to place an order.  Finally I got to place my order.  The shave ice was similar to the ones in Oahu an Maui.  I got the blue raspberry and hawaiian punch plus vanilla ice cream on the bottom.  After the crowd left, the owner was talking to us.  He was very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom for the first time. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the helpful service! There were so many different things to choose from. We got the Pitaya bowl and it was delicious 
Recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their shaved ice with ice cream and a snow cap! Their customer service and friendliness is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here just for the Acai bowls. The man working, I assume the owner, was so friendly! He helped us order and asked for both of our names. He took his time making some of the prettiest Acai bowls I have seen. You could tell he took pride in his work. They were great bowls! I loved all the options. I especially loved that he called us by name for the rest of the time we were there, even when we left and saying thank you! He was very personable and we loved the Acai bowls! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to be when it's hot out or even if you just feel like a bit of Hawaii. The owner is totally nice, and the flavors are amazing. There are approx 30 to choose from!  You can even get adzuki beans and mochi added!  

They also do iced coffee and frappe type drinks and the mighty pitaya bowl, which is basically dragon fruit blended and topped with fresh fruit and granola and honey. I had that during a previous visit. It was amazing! You've got to come in here, it's worth the visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Real Hawaiian shave ice! It is so hard to find the real thing so far from the ocean. Kevin was awesome and let us try different flavors. Honeymoon is the best flavor by far with shave ice. I topped it off with some ice cream. Flashbacks of Maui......Super chill mom and pop store"}
{"text":"Really good! So many options it's hard to decide! Great Shave Ice! The owner was very cool& helpful with selecting what we wanted."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. Great service, nice people, great menu. 
Will def be returning!"}
{"text":"The employees were so friendly and the snow cones were awesome. The ice was fine, and there was a lot of syrup. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on our recent trip to Phoenix based on Yelp reviews.  It's a little place with a few tables.  I ordered a pina-colada & coconut with ice cream shaved ice.  My husband had the cherry & orange with ice cream, and my son had the hawaiian punch & strawberry with ice cream.  Upon entering the place, we saw a man arranging items on a freezer.  We didn't get a welcome or hello.  We stood there for many minutes reading the menu when he finally told us to let him know when we were ready.  First impression, not very welcoming, but we'll give it a try anyway.  We placed our orders, and he insisted that my son try a flavor that he originally wanted to order.  The person behind the counter said that it was not popular with kids.  We really appreciated that.  That gesture made up for the lack of greeting when we came in.  Both my husband and son loved their shaved ice.  I liked mine too, but thought it was a bit on the sweet side.  I know that seems silly, but I've had many shaved ice in Hawaii that wasn't as sweet.  We all got the small size which was $2 a cup with 50 cents extra for a scoop of ice cream.  Overall, it was a cheap treat perfect for the hot Arizona weather."}
{"text":"Awesome/Authentic Hawaiian shaved ice....My husband and I had just returned from Hawaii and were craving authentic shaved ice....we googled and found this location...Kevin (the owner) was a nice and friendly as they come...The sizes were generous and the shaved ice....was the best I've ever had...taking another trip back today, and bringing others. Best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great! Where else can you get Hawaiian shaved ice desserts in the desert? Very friendly, helpful guy owns the place. The fruit bowls are really good. Go ahead and try a new flavor before you order, the owner is more than glad to let you do so. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Visited in from SF and this was a solid find next to where I was staying! Owner guy is super friendly and welcoming.  Only got the shave ice when I went but it was a cooling relief from the temperatures that grace the area.  Nice touch is that they top off the ice that inevitably melts when you add the flavors making sure it is a true full ball of cooling goodness.  Definitely will come by again next time I visit the area!"}
{"text":"Have I never rated this place? WOW, this place is amazing. I hate to share this, but I really have to. It use to be only the owner working, now there is another lady there, very friendly as well. We went on a Sunday not realizing they were closed, but they happened to be there filling their supplies, and they let us in and made us some shave ice. WHAT?! So freaking amazing and the shave ice is SO GOOD! I crave it all the time. My friend is from Kauai and she said it tastes like home. Li Hing Mui is really good, I usually get that with Melona with mochi and ice cream and snow cap. Since there's only 2 people working usually, the wait time can be a little long. But very much worth it."}
{"text":"The shaved ice was delicious and freshly made. The owner was super nice and let us try all the flavors we wanted, and YUMMMM with condensed milk on top!"}
{"text":"Finally found some good stuff here .... the best in Arizona ...."}
{"text":"Best Acai I've had in Phoenix! Excellent customer service, very friendly. Fruit was fresh and tasty. Acai was a good quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Let me start off my review by saying that I do not like to post negative reviews. Mainly because I feel guilty if let's say the service was good, but the food was bad. I am the type of person that does not want to hurt anyone's feelings. Well, the owner, Kevin, of this establishment was rude enough that I am willing to post a negative Yelp review. The shaved ice was delicious, however the service from the owner was hands down the worst I have ever encountered at a restaurant. I promise that I am not exaggerating. The gentlemen is rude to the point that he is borderline hostile. During the brief 10 minutes that I was there I saw him be terribly rude to his employee and he was rude to my friend and I several times even though we were completely polite the entire time that we were there. This is just a fair warning for those that may try the place. I just feel that no matter how good the product is that hostile rudeness does not need to be tolerated. If you do decide to go then I suggest casually observing his behavior and actions while you are there and you will clearly see what I mean.  Lastly, while scrolling through the reviews I noticed that I am not the first customer that is refusing to return after the poor and inexcusable treatment by Kevin. It is a shame, because the shaved ice is tasty, BUT not tasty enough to tolerate a hostile bully. I hope others are willing to stand with me by not supporting a business that bullies its patrons. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."}
{"text":"1st time going... And I'm now going to be a loyal customer, there smoothies and different shave ice is AMAZING!! I recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"KamanaWana is a prime example of how to do a shaved ice shop the right way. 

My girlfriend and I stopped by for a quick dessert when we were in the area. We both opted for small ices. I had my usual tiger's blood while she ordered a combination of honeymoon and guava while adding snowcaps to both. A snowcap is basically a drizzle of sweetened condensed milk, which I liked so much I regret not adding a second one to my order. What's even cooler about their product is that their concentrated flavors are all flown in from Hawaii, meaning what you're getting is the legit product. 

The guy working the front even let us try various samples, something that's incredibly uncommon with shaved ice. This helped influence my girlfriend's decision, while I stuck with something safe. 

The consistency of the ice is actually more on the fluffy side. Not quite as fluffy as the increasingly popular sno, but not quite as cubed/crushed as a lot of typical shaved ice places. We both really enjoyed it!

In addition to shaved ice, they also have pitaya bowls and various coffee drinks which might be interesting to try out on a return visit - which we definitely intend to do in the future.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had the wedding cake and honeymoon with ice cream and sweet cream on top. Heaven! Their cold drip latte is delicious. This will now be my new coffee stop!"}
{"text":"Really yummy and the people working there were so friendly! My daughter had just spent the summer in Hawaii and thought the acai bowls here were really close to the ones in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  They sure brought the Shave Ice to Phoenix!  The wife had the Pitaya Aloha bowl and it was great. The kids and I had the plain run of the mill flavors on our shave ice but the owner gave us a sample of his personal best, and now I know what flavor I getting the next time, the next time afta dat, and the next time afta dat, and so on and so forth. 
You have to add ice cream on the bottom and top it off with condensed milk on top. You will not regret it!
Best of all, braddah making the shave ice (the owner) is a fellow Waipahu-ian!"}
{"text":"I had the Honeymoon with ice cream and it was sooooooooo goooooooood.  I wanted to go back for more a few hours later.  The people working were very nice.  I don't know what is in the honeymoon (it was a secret), but it was so delicious.  I can not wait to go back to try the other flavors.  Luckily it is across the street from me and I wish i would have tried it three months ago.  I was missing out on the goodness.  My son had a smoothie and it was also very delicious and the color was beautiful.  I will for sure recommend it to all my family and friends.  LOVE IT!!!  Also the portion was gigantic.  my son and I both ate the regular."}
{"text":"First time here and it's a great experience for me and my family! Pitaya bowl is exceptionally good!!! How good? You gotta try it yourself! The owners are very friendly and nice! Hope they will open one in the west side!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got the Hawaiian ice with ice cream and condensed milk on top. It was amazing!! The employees were extremely friendly and kind as well! I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to get real deal Hawaiian shaved ice. So many flavors to choose from. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Mahalo"}
{"text":"Best dessert in the desert! Honestly, probably better than any shave ice in Hawai'i, too. Honeymoon with snowcap is the way to go, but there are no bad choices here. Kevin is a shave ice wizard!!"}
{"text":"I want to move closer to this place, so I can go everyday! 

This stuff is SO f**king good!

I had no idea what to order so the owner gave me about 6 little sample cups of different flavors to try.  All of them were delicious and only made my decision more difficult.

In the end, I think I decided on the boysenberry, apricot, and some green stuff called Li Hing Mui. 

There are so many flavors that I could have spent at least 20 minutes trying to decide, if I hadn't received help from the owner, who is extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best shaved ice place in AZ! Great service and a great treat! Definitely would recommend and will be going back soon! Unlike other places, they have samples and they are very generous with the lechera! 12/10 in my book!"}
{"text":"Such a such fun shaved ice shop! Me and my daughter got a regular size rainbow shaved ice, it was HUGE and so delicious! Both of the guys working were very nice and made an effort to get to know us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were looking for a tasty shaved ice place yesterday since it was burning hot outside and we happened to stumble across this place and boy was I happy that we did! The owner was absolutely amazing and joked with us and even gave us a whole bunch of free samples to try. He even made us a mini pitaya bowl after we already had paid for our shaved ice! He was so grateful that we had found this place out and decided to come in. Everything there is straight from Hawaii so you know you are getting the best of the best. I suggest getting the shaved ice with the hidding ice cream in the middle. Once you get to the ice cream, woahhh, its like it is a whole new treat! I am definitely coming back many more times this summer and I highly highly suggest everyone to give this a try! You wont regret it! If I could rate this 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I tried both their shaved ice and Pitaya Bowl. 

Didn't know what to get, since it was my first time there... so I got the 'HoneyMoon' Shaved Ice w/ ice cream and snow capped (sweetened condense milk). It was really yummy and refreshing!

I got the Tropical Pitaya Bowl and it was unique to me. Nice portion and I enjoyed it. You can either blend it with Apple Juice or Coconut Water. I chose Apple Juice because it costs 75 cents more if you choose Coconut water. Next time, I will try coconut water. You can also choose between honey or agave. I chose honey because I never liked agave. He also give you a Pitaya bowl punch card. Buy 9 get 1 free.

I'm craving this place often now, and I plan to go back regularly! The owner is so nice and patient."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and this place is awesome!

I had a Regular with Strawberry, Mango and Peach flavorings.  Plus I added vanilla ice cream.

Will be back Weekly! 

Would give 7 stars if i could..."}
{"text":"This is for sure a hidden gem! If you are looking for authentic shaved ice this is the place you need to visit. They have a huge variety of flavors, for an indecisive person as myself it is hard to choose lol. The owner (I am assuming he was the owner) was very nice and helpful. He gave us a few samples of some of his popular flavors and I really enjoyed the pickle flavor he mixed it with some other flavor I can't remember but I was surprisingly really good. He also gave us a sample of cherry cola and I loved it lol. I ordered a small with Hawaiian paradise and strawberry and a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle. 
And it was outstanding! I really enjoyed this shop. 
The syrups they use here are really well made which I really enjoyed. If you are a true shaved ice fanatic you will truly appreciate this shop. They also have Hawaiian coffee and acai bowls that I've yet to try, but have heard so much about them. I am definitely coming back here when I am craving some good ol' Hawaiian shaved ice. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This is the most legit Shaved Ice place in town.  The owner is super friendly and spreads aloha spirit to all that come to try his delicious treats.  The endless combinations of flavors mean this place always surprises me and makes for good clean fun when finding refuge from our hot summer days..."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until I randomly saw it on yelp and saw that it got great reviews. I was amazed that I only lived 5 mins away from this place. This shops hidden in the complex so keep an eye out for it. The stores small and nicely decorated with Hawaiian pics. The owners super friendly and let me try some samples because there were so many different flavors to choose from and I had no clue what to get. 

As I was waiting for my snow cone he was telling me about Hawaii because I've never been there. Since I was the only one there, he was conversing with me the whole time, which I liked. I wish he could put a huge banner outside by the corner or something because people should know about this place! It's very good! 

I got half Melona and half tigers blood with snow cap(condensed milk), mochi and ice cream inside. I added the li hing powder myself. It has a sweet and sour taste to it, which is yummy with the snow cone. Melona is amazing it tastes like the korean Melona ice cream bar if you've ever had it before! I got a small and it's still a huge portion for me. The price is very inexpensive. Overall, everything was great! I will come back with some friends :)"}
{"text":"Shaved ice was bomb dot com. We had the honeymoon and pina colada flavors with vanilla ice cream in the middle topped with snow cap. WOW - I can't believe I have been missing this all my life. Flavors are authentic from Hawaii per owner. I also had the Aloha Pitaya Bowl that consisted of blueberries and bananas. There a total of four types of pitaya bowls to choose from depending on which fruits you prefer. 

We were also given a stamp card for pitaya bowls. I will definitely be returning to this hole in the wall place. I'm excited to add new toppings on the shaved ice next time."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly environment!  The shaved Ice was a little bit of homeEverything I missed about Hawaii was right on the edge of my spoon. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. Too bad we live so far away. Sometimes we drive all across town just for a snow cone. Lucky for my kids this place is close to their pediatrician so they get a treat everytime they are sick. Prices are very reasonable and they really do have the best shaved ice."}
{"text":"What would I do without the trusty help of Yelp?

Not being used to the weather of Phoenix, Arizona has driven me to find every cold dessert, smoothie or drink place to keep me from fainting in this dry, dessert heat. I am thrilled to have discovered Kamana' Wana which is an unassuming shaved ice shop in the corner of a little plaza that provides a sweet escape from the warm Phoenix sun.

I decided to share a regular sized cup of shaved ice with a friend and chose the P.O.G., Mango and Red Raspberry flavors. We also decided to do the snow cap (sweetened, condensed milk) added to the top and a little sprinkle of Li Hing Mui powder on top.

The shaved ice here is as good as it gets! Flavorful, fruity and not sickenly sweet syrups provide a refreshing addition to the fluffy, melt in your mouth shaved ice. The condensed milk adds a small level of creaminess and the Li Hing powder gives it a contrasting salty note to bring out even more sweetness from the syrup.

There is a variety of flavors and you can choose up to three. There are also free add-ons like condensed milk, sour spray and Li Hing powder. They also carry Pitaya bowls here which I have yet to try, as well as coffee.

The owner, Kevin was so kind, calm and radiated friendliness. He made each shaved ice cup with total care and made sure to talk to every single person. Because of this Kamana' Wana may have a bit of a wait as he is the sole worker here, but it is so worth it! For $3.50 you get a decent sized cup that you can share with another person without getting too tired of it and no tax, you pay what is advertised.

Definitely will be back to try more flavors and of course the Pitaya bowl!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Omg. So fluffy soft and it cools you down. It's not like the shaved ice that is more like gravel. Go here. Try it. And you will love it."}
{"text":"Amazing choices of ice flavors.  Most ice places have ice pebbles but this was like snow.  Tasty flavors not like medicine. The small size is huge. $5 for two smalls  They also have coffee"}
{"text":"Best shaved ice around! Worth the drive for us from Tempe and our usual Bahama Bucks which is good also but we give this place the edge because of the portions size and reasonable prices for it. Staff is very friendly, nice, and conversate alot with customers. Only downside is the size of the place with just four tables that you have a 30 minute time limit to use. Bit it's understandable due to the many customers they have. Definitely recommend! This is now my new favorite shaved ice joint in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Just like what we had on the Big Island!! Very authentic! The owner is super nice and gives you samples of the exotic flavors to help you decide."}
{"text":"Two friends and I absolutely loved our experience here! We tried a lot of the flavors and enjoyed both an acai/pitaya bowl and some Hawaiian shaved ices! Thank you Kevin so so much for having us, it was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I was looking for when I googled \"shaved ice\". The amount of flavors and combinations are literally never-ending! I am a lover of things I already know I like so I went back to a childhood favorite and got blackberry, raspberry, and grape. If I closed my eyes I was 8 years old and it was summer time again and I was enjoying a Sno-cone with my sisters. My brother-in-law got one that I cannot recall all the flavors of but he was ecstatic over the lychee and said it was perfect, and that that addition of the ice cream and \"snow cap\" make it so unique and tasty!

The owner is super cool and chill, joked with us and a few minutes into our delicious ice asked us how we liked them. The whole place is clean with a relaxed, Hawaiian vibe. Their only problem is they can get busy and they only have a couple of tables, but that just means you can share a table and make some friends! Aloha!"}
{"text":"If you're a shaved ice fan, this place will hit the spot! Not only does the menu sport over 60+ flavors of different ices, it includes unique flavors such as Lychee, Horchata, and Mai Tai. You can even opt to get a complimentary sour squirt to your ice! And, if you haven't seen the pictures yet, the helpings are very generous. I ended up ordering a size small with Lychee, Cherry, and ice cream in the middle. It was so delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the other flavors. 
In addition to that, the owner is very nice and friendly. The restaurant is decked out in complete Hawaiian theme, and it made me feel like I wasn't in Phoenix anymore. Also, if shaved ice is not for you, the menu also offers acai and pitaya bowls. I've tried acai bowls in California, but pitaya is new to me, it's a dragonfruit from cacti which also looks equally delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and I were in the mood for shaved ice and stopped here. Kevin was very nice and let us sample some of the most popular flavors. The prices are great for the amount of shaved ice you get. I love the free topping choices!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on Friday night after dinner. I've been here a few times, surprised there wasn't a long line on a Friday night. I try to order something different every time I'm here. This time I had the guava and green tea with ice cream, of course. It's not the same without ice cream. You can't go wrong with guava flavor not so much the green tea. It didn't taste like the green tea  flavor at all. 

It's really small place with few tables. If shaved ice is not your thing, they do acai bowls too. Their acai bowl is loaded with goodness, worth trying for sure, and great replacement meal."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I try to stop in as much as I can. The flavors are awesome, the service is great. You just couldn't ask for anything more. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent shaved ice and coffee. Can't recommend this enough! I has the piña colada with ice cream and it was the best sweet thing I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I'd never had a shave ice until today and I'm so glad my first try was from Kamana'Wana. 

I wasn't really looking forward to it because I despise sno cones but my goodness, these are so different! Nothing at all like those hard crunchy, watery things you get at the fair only to eventually spill it all over your Poison shirt you had just expertly fringed and added beads to. The boys over in line at the Gravitron will never let you down for that!

Joking aside, the atmosphere is super clean and welcoming. There were a few people ahead of us and the lovely man behind the counter mentioned it might be a bit. No problem! This is a Hawaiian treat, you have to be on island time here. We grabbed a seat and bopped to the reggae as we waited. The portions are HUGE so I ordered a small black cherry (I'm a chicken, I'll admit it!) with ice cream and a snow cap. Watching him make it was so fun. He takes his time and you can tell he truly cares for his customers by churning out a beautiful cup of heaven. 

It's a must that you order it with ice cream and a snow cap. The texture of the ice mixed with the ice cream is such a fun and unusual experience. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"It's definitely worth 5 stars. I got dragon's blood with ice cream and a snow cap. Great flavor, fairly inexpensive, and it's the type of desert that doesn't leave you feeling fat when you leave. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"What a great shave ice shop!  I popped in and got a shave ice (coconut and Tigers Blood) with ice cream and snow cap - YUM!!  I love that the ice is fluffy, that is exactly the way I like it. The guys working were super fun, I love it when people interact with you and make you feel welcome. What an asset to this neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE place to get dessert in Phoenix.  The shaved ices are huge and absolutely delicious!  I love the soft fluffy texture of the ice.  I even got to witness how they get the flavors to penetrate the bottom of the cup so well!  He actually takes the whole ice on the bottom AND the top!  genius!

The owners are absolutely the friendliest people ever and they're always so welcoming and apologizing for any delay/wait or lack of seating even though we're always perfectly happy devouring the ice standing where we are.  

And the Pitaya bowl is absolutely divine.  I love getting that when I need something with a little more substance than soft, fluffy ice particles and sugar water :-)  probably a bit healthier too."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I went in. The owner is from the same city in Hawaii as me. But really they would've gotten the same amazing review regardless of him being incredibly nice. The type of place they remember you and what you get. I got a pitaya bowl. It's an acai bowl but with dragonfruit instead of acai. I got coconut water instead of Apple juice, and agave instead of honey. He asked me for my preferences (cause it was my first time) so I didn't have to have the menu memorized or even understand it. I can't wait to go back for some authentic Hawaiian shaved ice and more bowls!!"}
{"text":"Wow! How have we been missing this place all of these years? We got the \"tigers blood\" with \"snow capped\" tasted amazing! The people were more than accommodating of our large group and even have us some samples since it was out first time! We will definitely be back for more! So many flavors to choose from! Great summer treat for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Great service and very cool atmosphere and the shaved ice was like going to Hawaii without the air plane"}
{"text":"This place has the best hawaiin ice. A lot of flavors to choose from and the prices are good, the large could easily be for 2 people or 1 lol. Make sure to top off your hawaiin shave ice with li hing powder. Since the az summer is already starting this place is a good place to stop by and cool down. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I finally found real Hawaiian ice in AZ. Love Love Love. Great service, clean and everyone is friendly. Definitely coming back often."}
{"text":"I've been to so many \"snow cone\" places (on the mainland) and this is the real deal Hawaiian shave ice! Tons of flavors and you can put mochi or ice cream in it. Great place!"}
{"text":"We were in the area a couple weeks ago and I was looking for coffee. There's a Starbucks right there, but DON'T go there. Go here and get a coffee and a Shave Ice. The coffee is locally roasted, way better than Starbucks and cheaper! Now to the Shave Ice. The young man there was great. He bantered with me while my hubby was working on his phone. Very friendly and great sense of humor. He gave me several samples. Oh my--so many good flavors and fun to try. I ended up with a Honeymoon and some odd named Japanese flavor that I can't remember but was oh so good. I also tried Guava, Tiger's Blood, a pickle flavored one that was actually kind of good and a couple others. Ordered with ice cream, no snow cap, so delicious. I wish we lived closer as we'd be regular customers!"}
{"text":"I went to Thunderbird high school and have come here a few times and I do like the drinks that they provide. Lots of a flavors to choose from. I do recommend trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"I Was looking for something cold to cool me down and out do curiosity I decided to come here. I was greeted immediately and asked if i been here before. I was offered sample flavors before I placed an order to help deciding easier.  I got the coconut flavor and it was delicious! I wish I ordered a large but I'll definitely go back tomorrow before I catch my flight."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on vacation in Arizona and we found them on yelp. We enjoyed our shave ice, very authentic hawaiian shave ice and a variety of flavors. The owner is very personable. We would highly recommend to try them out."}
{"text":"I came here the other night when a craving for shaved ice set in. I ordered a small shave ice with dragon's blood and cherimoya flavors with ice cream in the bottom and a snow cap on top. It was absolutely delicious! We got to sample a few flavors since it was our first time in and we had no idea what to order. I really felt the employees went above and beyond to help us pick out flavors that we liked. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the prices were great. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get shave ice.  You can't get the same flavors they have back home but it's okay.  It's different than Rapasdos but still a good place to try. 

Unfortunately, we came on Saturday and their was only one worker so I already knew the wait was going to be long.  It was  25 minutes but I was fine with it because their was only one person working.  I enjoyed the local Hawaiian music that was playing.  

The guy asked for our individuals orders and wrote down everything so he could get the order correct.   Two orders were correct and two were wrong.  I ordered a rainbow.  It's called a rainbow for a reason (6 colors not three). I asked for Rainbow and he pouted.  If you don't know what flavors it is or don't want to make it then he should have asked instead of guessing.  By the way the flavors he selected were wrong.  It looked more like pastel rainbow.  I was disappointed that two orders were wrong and the syrup flavor was not the flavor advertised.

In addition a lady walked in with a dog the size of a chihuahua in her purse.  The guy told the lady flat out you can't bring dogs in here.  Umm...hello  how the does he know this is not a service dog?  I thought it was rude and not the correct way to approach the situation.  Not all service dogs wear that strap that identifies them as a service dog.  By law it is not required for them to wear one.  I was completely shocked at the way he spoke to the female customer.  It wasn't busy just my family and two other customers.  Only when the lady walked out is when he attempted to explain the reason why he can't have animals there.  Are you kidding me??  You wait until the customer leaves to explain!!   Customer service is important.

The shave ice is crazy cheap, cheaper than Hawaii but if I can taste more ice than syrup than to me it's not worth it.  Overall it was mediocre at best but guys attitude toward the lady and lack of knowledge for shave ice is a disappointment.   This is one place I will not return to. Get the real deal in Hawaii or at least someone who know what the flavors are supposed to taste like. 

If you're not familiar with shave ice then it will probably taste good.  Upside is they don't charge you for mochi ."}
{"text":"The Acai bowl was so yummy! It was really refreshing and the people working there were very nice."}
{"text":"OMG ! So yummy and so many options. They let you try anything you want. The people are so nice and helpful LOVEEE!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty :)  lots of flavors to choose from. Get the ice cream add in, it's very delicious!"}
{"text":"To whom it may concern... If you don't ever read another one of my reviews... please treat yourself to this Hawaiian treat!   IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! I order the exact same order I saw on a Yelp review (Tiger's Blood, Hawaiian Punch, and ice cream) I added sweet cream on top. I went last week and as I type this I am on my way again! Excellent customer service and they let you sample too!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was in February and I would now consider myself a regular. I have brought my best friend, my fiancé, my future mother-in-law, and my mom and all have impressed time and time again with Kamana'Wana açaí bowls. 10/10 would recommend to give this little place a try. The quality is far superior to any other açaí place I've tried--the fruit is always fresh and super tasty!  I get the Hula Bowl with honey!"}
{"text":"We were in from San Diego and I was looking for Acai bowls, and I stumbled on this place via Yelp.   My daughter and husband are huge fans of Shave ice, I usually just go for the ride.  Based on the yelp reviews, I decided to surprise them by taking them here.  Soooooo glad I did.  The syrups are made with real cane sugar and imported from Hawaii.   He has tons of amazing flavors that you wouldn't ever dream of.  The owner is hands down the nicest guy ever!  He had us try some amazing flavors, like Melona and cherimoya, both delicious.  As I mentioned, I usually go along for the ride, but this time I ordered as well since the tastings were so good.  My husband got his snow capped, the snow here is like no other, it's thick and amazing.  My daughter had the ice cream in the middle, traditional Hawaiian style.  The ice cream was so creamy, homemade and delicious that my daughter keeps saying that she needs to get more of that ice cream.  Definitely go here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Friendly service, consistent and always worth the wait.  They are always coming out with new flavors and happy to give us samples as we are waiting or trying to decide what we want.  This is as close to Hawaii as we can get.  Kevin and his staff are always happy.  My favorite is ice cream with POG topped off with snow caps.  They also cater, too!"}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of shaved ice even when I was in HI. Everyone told me to get an ice and I was like, \"Okay, whatever.\" I tried them on the beach and could not figure out what the big deal was. It was just an icey. However, I have heard so much about this place that I have been wanting to try it. As I was in the hood I zoomed in. Tricky to find so look for the Subway/Starbucks Mall and watch construction please. 

These treats are even better than anything I had in the islands. They mix the ice with ice cream and condensed cream on top. It sounds odd but it is really, really delicious. I had a half coconut half Mai Tia/Ice Cream in the middle and snow capped. ( condensed cream) So, so ,so, so good! I was actually shocked how much I liked it. I am dying to go back and try the bowls they have with the granola and fruit. 

I can not believe I am giving an ice place five stars but I really loved it. I loved the island stories from the owner. I read the other comments about him. Yes he takes a bit to warm up but stick with it. He razzed me about my accent and island lingo pronunciation for sure but by the end of the visit I was charmed and listening to his whole life story. I love island story telling and the Aloha spirit. He is also an ex Marine so I can respect that. 

Anyway, check it out, good stuff. I had a medium at 3 bucks so pretty cheap treat. Plus, it made a national best ice cream list. Gotta love that."}
{"text":"I recommend the honeymoon and piña colada with ice cream and snow capped. My friends and I will definitely come back for more very soon!"}
