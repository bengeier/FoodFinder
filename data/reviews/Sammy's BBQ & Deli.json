{"text":"I went to this place thinking it was George's Deli as it is in the same location. It's not close. Its much much worse. The guy running this place is rude, the place is more expensive than georges (like $7 vs $9 for burger and fries). He was rude, charged me for extra pickles (+$1), gave me a burger that was FROZEN - right in front of me. Not even ashamed (the sign outside says that its fresh made) and tasted frozen Terrible overall. Just go to George's. It's across the street on Bloor/Bathurst."}
{"text":"Gave this place a 2nd chance.  The place could be labeled as a Portuguese / burger joint.  They are getting better, and learning to tweak their dishes and offer a better meal.  I'm still apprehensive about the place, and know that they could do better.  At least the rotisserie chicken is not so bad with an order of salad.  Prices are ok for the area."}
{"text":"The sight of the slowly-turning rotisserie and the offer of a $6.25 quarter-chicken meal with two sides was what drew me into Sammy's. Sitting just north of the northwest corner of Bloor and Bathurst streets, it's a bright and clean spot, that's very modern yet has strange antique flourishes like a 1964 Elvis calendar and an old juke box perched above the stairs. There are no tables here, just ten blue marshmallow-shaped stools strung along their long counter.   Also on the menu were fish and chips, burgers and fries, and all day breakfast. But I had my heart set on chicken. I waited eight minutes and got an order of dark meat with rice and Greek salad to go. At home, I was excited to tear into this value laden meal but I was disappointed. The rice was undercooked. And the salad was pretty poor; lettuced drenched with really crumbly feta. The chicken was OK, but there was hardly any meat on the bones. Considering that I barely touched my rice and salad, this \"great value\" suddenly became a pretty expensive non-meal. I had to eat again an hour later.  I wish I could give this place a better review -- especially in light of the very friendly service -- but I would never order this meal again. If I try them again it will be during a busier service period (say lunch instead of dinner) and with a more foolproof order. It's hard to screw up eggs and toast right?  Obligatory Title Pun: Leaves SAM-thing to be desired.  Menu Readability: Bright, backlit and blue.   Need to mention: Cash only.   What this place teaches me about myself: I would never have thought this, but there is such thing as too much feta."}
