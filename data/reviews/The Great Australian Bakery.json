{"text":"Never seen anything like this. Chicken cheese avocado topped off with a Bundaburg Ginger beer.  Owner is really friendly.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Family visited Scottsdale this past weekend. Stopped for a quick snack, great tasting pies, awesome desserts. Super friendly staff. A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Was fantastic, had the chicken avocado pie and the sausage roll.  Service was good too, friendly staff. Flavor was amazing, will definitely come back for some Bundaberg rum when they get the bar put in."}
{"text":"It was great to get a taste of Australia again! Recently 10 of us on a cricket tour stopped in for a Sunday morning breakfast. The coffee was great, the service was very friendly and you have to try the sausage rolls. As most of us were ex-pats we are pretty familiar with a good pie and no-one left dissapointed. Hats off to Laurence and the team, great work and we look forward to seeing you again."}
{"text":"Walking around in the desert heat and I needed something to revive me. The staff in here were so sweet and friendly.  I loved that they actually seemed to enjoy chatting with their guests. I was shown where they make all their pastries- everything in-house. With some help from the guy behind the counter I decided on the ANZAC bisquit with an iced coffee spider (iced coffee with caramel syrup and a scoop of ice cream). Both were delicious and just enough sugar to get me through the rest of my afternoon."}
{"text":"It possibly is the best coffee in scottsdale.  The spinach feta quiche and apple turn over are amazing.  My daughters iced caramel latte was very good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife is Australian so it was much surprise that we stumbled onto an Australian Bakery in the middle of Arizona. It was such a treat to have lamingtons with a Bundaberg... although we were a bit disappointed that they didn't serve flat whites."}
{"text":"I think the food is probably fine just so long as you're not Australian. The meat isn't right, the pastry isn't right and the sausage rolls just made me cry on all counts. Oh and the prices? Just as well you're in old town and targeting tourists because those prices are ridiculously high.   All I bought were meat pies and sausage rolls. So maybe other things are nice but they are not a good representation of an Aussie staple.   If you've never eaten a real Aussie pie then you'll probably think these are okay. If you're Australian take a pass. Either make your own or wait till you get home. If you want authentic don't buy pies from here. Save your money, fly to Australia and have a great pie."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries and coffee! Top notch service and friendly staff. Highly recommend this place in old town!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Slow and everyone in line had an issue. The menu prices were out of date and people were walking out. After 20 min in line the cashier walked away and I walked out. Pathetic!"}
{"text":"Kim was so sweet and gave us a sample of lamington - spelling? But was yummy! Their coffe is to die for. But let me talk about the spinach and feta roll - I've never tasted such flavor in a delicious roll!"}
{"text":"They Cater! The Great Australian Bakery catered a breakfast event for our organization. We had 100 people in attendance and everyone LOVE the food. They had sausage rolls, bacon & cheese quiches, Spinach & feta quiches, veggie pie, and a full assortment of their delicious baked treats. Their staff is so friendly and did a great job interacting with our guests. I would highly recommend them for your next event. I love that their food is unique and delicious. We all get tired of the same sandwiches and doughnuts. Cheers!"}
{"text":"While the selection is a little small, the quality seems high.  The warmed scone I had was easily one of the better biscuits I've had, with just the right amount of butter and raspberry jam.  Their cooler of bottled water and soft drinks seems to be very convenient for those strolling through Old Town.  Service was fine, especially considering how very busy they were.  It was a bit of a pain to have to ask what was in everything as there were no tiny signs with ingredients/descriptions that I saw."}
{"text":"This cafe/ bakery is an amazing place. My wife and I were visiting from California and found this local gem. The women behind the counter were so nice and the drinks and \"pasties\" were delicious! Highly recommend this placed!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Quick, friendly, and clean. Love it here! Come for hearty savory and sweet pastry and leave full and satisfied! Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"This is a great new place in Old Town Scottsdale, owned by an authentic Aussie! We have been there twice in the past two days. Get there as soon as you can!   Just passing by when we weren't hungry the first time, we opted for an appealing matchstick pastry. Then yesterday we went there hungry for breakfast. My wife had the spinach and feta roll. I had the favorably reviewed sausage roll, finding it unique, delectable, and generous.   After the savories, we shared the most amazing apple turnover! Luckily we live about three blocks from The Great Australian Bakery and we're thinking we want to eat our way through the entire menu!   Whether you've been to Australia or not, you'll love this place. The pastries used around the savories and sweets are flaky and, we think, just perfect!  TGAB is something delightfully different in Old Town. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from L.A. And saw a Australian flag and remembered reading about Aussie pies. Decided to get a little Pie to share with hubby and teenage daughter for a snack. Got the Sausage roll after talking to Ian who was so gracious in describing what he had in the case. Got in car and I took a bite and could not stop. It was so delicious I ate the whole roll! At first I thought I would eat a third, then kept driving and ate half, couldn't stop eating it! It was that good! I had to turn back and get another one for hubby and daughter!!  Ian said they have happy hour for the food! Couldn't believe it! You can't go wrong with this place! They even have vegetarian pies and sweet pies! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Best meat pie I've had since Australia! Can't believe it took so long to find. I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"I've been twice now. First time had a sausage roll that was great. Next time had a beef curry pie that was awesome.  Also tried a lemington. Very tasty desert. Great food. Quick service."}
{"text":"I have never been to Australia, but the fare served here reminds me a lot of the types of foods I've enjoyed during my visits to England over the years.  Whether you're craving a mincemeat pie, steak and kidney pie, steak and mushroom pie, sausage roll, scones, or other assorted pastries this is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat.  My only complaint is that everything is a-la carte and putting together a meal gets a bit pricey. I wish they would offer some combo meals that include meat pie, side dish and a drink.   They do have some combos if you are ordering a large amount of food for a party or group event but nothing for individuals.  There's also not much atmosphere to the place as its a large open space with a cafeteria feel.  Overall though it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I had the meat pie, way too much Worcestershire sauce for my taste.  But my friends thought it was okay.  I guess if you favor authentic pies, you might try the place.  It did piss me off to have owner coming running out with two orange cones  as I was about to park, reserving his space.  His corvette ( red with \"Aussie\" plates) was parked two spots over but evidently he feels entitled to a space.  Arrogant ass.  It's public parking.  You don't get a reserved spot. I had to wait for him to pull out and move his car over two spaces so I could park.  That and mediocre food won't have me returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across this on Yelp. Stopped by today and it exceeded every expectation! We got the bacon and cheese sausage roll and the cottage pie and they were beyond perfect! They even threw in some insanely delicious pavlova cookies for us. We'll be back regularly for sure."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Australia, one of the things I miss most about home is the small town Aussie bakery.  Every town main street and suburban shopping mall has a bakery that in addition to bread, sells delicious savory pies, pasties and sausage rolls, and sweet treats like lamingtons, custard tarts and matchsticks.  Great Australian Bakery in Scottsdale has captured the spirit of these places and landed them in my new backyard in Arizona.  An exciting find! In addition to the traditional bakery counter, they also combine another iconic Aussie landmark - the local \"pub\" (public bar).  The bakery has a really nice bar space serving a full range of drinks including an Aussie style bitter on tap (apparently brewed at a local microbrewery just around the corner).  If you think you might like a real taste of Australian cuisine and friendly culture, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had a 2-1 coupon and due to extreme boredom decided to return and try the desserts. First problem was that they were out of Vanilla cake Slices, so the dessert choices were limited and I did not want one of the pre-made cold greasy meat pies. Ended up with two Lamington's which were white cake topped with chocolate and coconut. Honestly, I have no idea when these things were made as the dude spent a few minutes inside the freezer grabbing the items, so they obviously don't make they desserts in house, but they freeze them in-house. The cake basically tasted stale as one would expect and they did not even have a proper take out box as they were just stuffed into a paper bag. They should just turn the place into a petting zoo with Koala bears and kangaroo's and that would be a better use of this space than the frozen food factory it is now."}
{"text":"Really tasty food place tucked away in downtown Scottsdale. Staff was friendly and the service was quick! A must try for some unique foods."}
{"text":"Excellent service and I LOVE the idea of having a bakery and a bar together in the same place, but the Lamington was stale and the pasty was not very warm. I think if they are going to serve baked goods so late then they need to make a fresh batch in the evening."}
{"text":"Looking for something that is not the norm? Look no further the the great Australian bakery, the steak and cheese pie is divine and the lamington is to die for. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I was just walking by and this bakery caught my eye. Ordered the red curry chicken meat pie - yum!   Flaky dough and spicy creamy goodness inside.  Sat outside on a 110? day because I'm a masochist like that, but they have a huge, air conditioned space inside and even a big ole' bar. Will come again.  By the way, I saw some other reviews saying that the pies taste frozen - not my experience at all. Was told that they make everything in house, and it tastes like it."}
{"text":"We spotted this place and decided to grab some to go on our way out of Old Town. (We were still full from lunch!) I walked in and asked some questions that were answered by the breathtakingly gorgeous Aussie guy behind the counter. After some discussion we decided the sausage roll and the Lamington were the 2 'most Aussie' things to try. They did not disappoint. ... DELICIOUS! The entire family asking if we can go back tomorrow!  The items lend themselves well to sharing, so if we do go back, we would likely order many different things and divide each into fourths! The service was friendly, witty, intelligent (did I mention gorgeous?)  Made this middle aged lady's day! Swing by this bakery if you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. My husband had his favorite sausage roll and i tried a curry beef pie.  My curry beef pie was delicious! the curry flavor was mild.  I also tried the Ginger beer that was recommended (non alcoholic) and my husband and I both liked it. I cant wait to go back to try it."}
{"text":"A light lunch of steak and mushroom pie washed down with iced tea was all I was planning to have when I walked into this bakery, but the pie was so tasty that it kicked my appetite up a few notches and I wanted to try another item. I decided to get the vegetable pasty - it was so good, with flaky puff pastry covering a well-seasoned medley of vegetables. The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere very informal, and the prices are great. This is a great stop for a quick meal or snack during a jaunt around Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for spring training and a group of us went here after a giants game. Overall my experience here was great! We got drinks and the owner of the place treated us to some delicious Australian pastries. They also have shuffleboard, which we played for about an hour. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Wow, the chicken artichoke pot pie was unexpectedly delicious - hot, flaky, savory!!! We loved it. We were not sure what to expect so we picked 1 \"safe\" item - bacon quiche pie. It was also very tasty and super satisfying. But, I wish we would have picked one of the more unique flavors. I could see coming back everytime we visit the area. Great friendly service too. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The sausage rolls are legit! Despite them being a mouthful and far larger than the ones I would eat at children's birthday parties when I was a kid, the pastry dough that encases the sausage is so flaky and delicious! Like with pizza, it's all about the crust, the same can be said for savories, it's all about the dough! The Red Curry Chicken is another must, it has a slight spice but I feel it's missing a yogurt garnish of sorts. I love that I work in old town and it's a short jaunt down to the bakery, I expect many future visits there!"}
{"text":"Nothing like classic Aussie comfort food like a savory meat pie.  Located in the heart of Old Town.   I was finally able to try one of the popular pies amongst the locals which is the chicken cheese and avocado.  The two previous times I stopped by they were sold out.  It tasted like a chicken club sandwich wrapped in a flaky pie crust.  Unique and not something traditionally you would find down under.    But since that that wasn't available the first thing I ever tried was the steak and mushroom pie.  Chunks of sirloin and the mushrooms were so thinly sliced that I couldn't even couldn't even taste them but that's fine by me.  But it's a hearty pie and filling!  I'll be back to try the Curry Beef Pie.    The samples of the lamingtons spongebcakey bites are a nice little treat if you've never tried it and like coconut flakes.    5 stars for these filling pies made with quality ingredients and look out for the expanded bar area as well coming soon at this location to catch your favorite Aussie rugby club as well."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick bite. Service is brilliant  the chunky steak was a little dry.... Needs more sauce. The taste was good   Will be back"}
{"text":"After watching The Great British Baking Show on Netflix 3 times, I began drooling for meat pies and yelped meat pies and found this gem of a bakery.   Pies:  Mince and Cheese: My favorite pie from here is the minced and cheese pie. The epitome of a meat pie. As Paul Hollywood says, the pie crusts don't have \"soggy bottoms,\" are baked to perfection, and with the perfect amount of flake. The filling has just the right amount of seasoning, is moist, fresh, and so tasty makes me want more!   Red Curry Chicken: Another pie I've tried from here is the red curry chicken pie and it's alright, but I would prefer my red curry chicken on rice instead of in a pastry. The pie was still tasty, but I recommend any of the traditional meat pies over this one!   Desserts:   Matchsticks: whipped cream with raspberries sandwiched between \"matchsticks\" or thin crisp flaky pastry. To die for.   Chocolate eclairs: they're eclairs. Freshly made. Way better than those frozen ones you get at Sam's and Costco. Bottom line--fresh is better and Australian pastries are better   Drinks:   They serve fresh lemonade here. It's a must drink. So refreshing and cooling especially with the Arizona heat! #clever   Check out my food pics from this restaurant on my food insta: @deeps.eats"}
{"text":"Delicious meat pies. Great service and the coffee is good too! Highly recommend for a quick bite and coffee if you don't want to wait in the insane line at Dutch bros or Starbucks!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 sausage rolls and they were GREAT! the minced pie was alright but id definitely go again"}
{"text":"Restaurant has been on my bookmark list for too long so when I passed by on a morning bike ride it was time to stop in.  The spinach feta pie was calling my name which held its own with some of my other local favorite bakeries quiche version of the same."}
{"text":"I have tried their food twice now and cannot wait to come back! My mouth is watering just thinking about their sausage rolls. They also offer some wonderful catering options that are so unique and different from the usual bagels or doughnuts. This place is a must-try for anyone looking for a delicious snack and some of the best coffee in town!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this place and it didn't disappoint.  We tried the spinach and feta roll, shepard's pie and vanilla slice for dessert - wow, so tasty!  There were so many amazing choices and I'll have to come back and try them all out."}
{"text":"The Rosemary and chicken pasty is so very tasty. As was the scone with jam & cream. The Anzac biscuit was good too, but it wasn't my favorite thing. Overall, good stuff. Will return for more."}
{"text":"Amazing! Meat pies and apple turnovers oh my! Stopped in on the bar side for a cold one while shopping then the bakery side on the way home for a treat. Holy cow, delicious. Wish I could take them home to Ohio."}
{"text":"Friendly Unique AUSTRALIAN MADE FOOD!!! I had the mince pie with mashed potato and peas amazing!!! Authentic Australia Flair. Stop in on Friday or Saturday for high quality LIVE  music!"}
{"text":"Best meat pies I've ever had! Great location and friendly staff, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great little authentic Australian bakery in Old town Scottdale!!  Delicious \"pasty\" and sausage roll.  Flaky and so good!  They also served lots of other sweet and savory pastries and lattes.  Don't miss the charming Australian accents and yummy food!"}
{"text":"The sausage rolls here are amazing and a great value.  I cant wait to eat through the pie menu.  So far ive had the meat and curry chicken, flaky buttery crust and very tasty inside.  A great addition to old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yummy and different, that's what I'll start my review with. Went in yesterday with my husband after we finished an appointment in the area. Found them on Yelp, very good reviews and walking distance almost from we were so why not.   When we went in, I was surprised at how the place looked, cafeteria style look, something's being built (or fixed) in the lobby where they're at so the first impression was, hmmm I hope this will be good!   You order at the cashier. Everything is pretty much on display so you can pick what you want and I'll be served immediately. Great if you're in a hurry.   My husband and I both ordered the spinach and feta cheese rolls and got 1 Rosemary chicken pie. Both are served with dipping sauces. We also ordered two coffees, small. Order came out to about $20+ not a bad deal!   We dug in and it was great. I particularly loved the Rosemary Chicken with it's dipping sauce. the sauce was had a lemony flavor, something that really went well with the chicken pie.   After we finished, I was craving dessert so I decided to try something there too. I had.. Umm.. Can't remember what it's called but it's basically a sponge cake dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut, OMG yes I wanna try that. I had it and to me and to the ppl who know Bounty Chocolate, this was a Bounty Cake! I liked it. It was moist and tasted very good, thanks to the guy who took our orders! It was his suggestion as well as the Rosemary chicken.   Great service, extra clean bathrooms, very good food! I'm going there again to try the rest of their pies! Yes, I love savory pies!   Note: I didn't have time to take pics. The food had to be eaten immediately, sorry! :p"}
{"text":"Although still very much a work in progress as of April 2016, the sausage rolls, beef mince pies and lamingtons are tasty enough for a bakery in Australia to be proud of."}
{"text":"Great Aussie food and the owner is a delight!  They offer a variety of tasty Australian meat pies as well as fun desserts!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but going in was slightly awkward. The owner came up to the counter mid-order and started talking about how amazing his food was and how we couldn't get food like that anywhere else. He spent a ton of time talking about himself and even offered me a job. It was a bit on the creepy side. I politely told him I'd think about it but I already have a job. My fiancé was uncomfortable with the situation because the owner seemed to only be interested in me. I felt like I was being flirted with. Took the food to go but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Got a soy cappuccino and the steak and cheese pie. Both were really good. Authentic Australian food. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for a quick snack. The service was great! Very nice people! But the food was... somewhat bland. I had a Vanilla Slice and it did not taste very Vanilla-y at all. The puff pastry top and bottom were very... tough to chew and cut.   My mom had the Chocolate Pie Tart... which tasted oddly salty with a hint of cocoa but nothing to write home about.   I also tried my sister's Ice Cream sandwich.... which was DELICIOUS. The cookies were a coconut oatmeal cookie and they were filled with flavor!  The major Downside was that it cost us 25 dollars for two Pies, A Slice and and Ice Cream Sandwich... but I suppose I should expect that from a bakery that bakes their stuff from scratch.  I wish I could say I'd eat here again but unfortunately my hope died with the food. Maybe someday I'll come back and try their savory menu... maybe then I my opinion will change.  But overall great service, the Style of the restaurant is very unique, and the atmosphere is very Australian (from the lack of Australia in my life except from TV.)"}
{"text":"The Great Australian Bakery is located in Old Town Scottsdale. They offer savory and sweet Australian baked goods. This is a casual order at the counter place that's not big on fancy atmosphere but is fresh new and clean at the time of this review.   The savory baked goods are Pasty in vegetable or beef and are very large in size.  The medium size savory baked good is the house made sausage roll.   Smaller but enough are the pies that come in many varieties.  We sampled two pies and one sausage roll. I thought the Steak Curry Pie was delicious and it was my favorite but the steak was a tad chewy just like in the Steak Mushroom Pie. The Sausage in the Sausage Roll was tasty but a tad dry with it's grease released in the pastry.  My husband did a great job eating the food so I had room to try a dessert.  They didn't have all the desserts for sale that they posted on the menu board but they were selling three desserts on my visit.  They were offering a vanilla slice that looked very similar to a nepolian, apple turnovers and an Australian Dessert called a Lamingtons filled and unfilled.   I went with the Lamington unfilled. It was a DELICIOUS light spongy cake frosted with GOOD chocolate and dusted with coconut. The cake was excellent. It tasted like pound cake and angel food had a baby.  Good visit overall  Three stars is positive and means worth a try!  After all this might be the only Australian Eatery in Metro Phoenix so that means it's the BEST Australian Eatery in the Metro Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"The almost identical twin of the Cornish Pasty that is pleasing palates on the other side of Old Town.  The rolls and tarts add a distinctive Australian twist to the concept."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Authentic Australian pastries at reasonable prices. The owner came out and had a good chat with him, great service! These guys deserve to win! Check this place out."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for something different for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  We were the only ones around so I was a little hesitant.  Interesting selection of Australian baked goods.  We shared a bacon and cheese roll and a small Lamington both of which were new experiences.   They were both  quite good although I didn't see or taste any cheese in the roll so I asked the proprietor who told me it is mixed in with the bacon and other meats.  Don't expect traditional Yankee bacon either.  It's almost undetectable when combined with the other meats in the mix.  The puff pastry was very flaky and tasty.  Their rolls are hardy and filling.  The Lamington was a sweet surprise - a sort of sponge cake wrapped in a chocolate gnash sprinkled with coconut.  They tout their coffee as the best around but I say nay nay.  My wife's mocha looked like chocolate milk and my Americano was weak.  This is a nice place for something different but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Loved being able to walk around Old Town Scottsdale and find this hidden gem! We are not local but ended up stopping to walk around. We bypassed the usual tacky tourist shops, and were pleasantly surprised when we peeked in here. Both sweet and savory bakery items are baked in-house every day. If it weren't for the fact we had eaten breakfast only an hour previously before we stopped by, we could have easily stocked up a tray and ate a lot and called it lunch! Hubby ordered a custard type pie, and I had a sausage roll. We were intrigued by the Lamington and were allowed to sample that. The specialty coffee drinks made by the barista are a little on the expensive side, but they also sell a variety of water, sodas, juice and milk in fridges. Definitely a treat, and highly recommend to anyone who visits Scottsdale to stop by!"}
{"text":"Great find!  Have a mince pie or sausage roll but leave room for dessert!!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Was just walking by with the family when we saw this place. Sausage rolls were great, good food, friendly service, couldn't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"Tried it when they opened, it was bad, they couldn't get the pastry right. It was greasy, the meat inside the pies was okay, no flavor. Sausage rolls were terrible, bad pastry & odd tasting meat. It's really overpriced. I went back today, no improvements at all. The meat pie tasted like a frozen meat pie from the supermarket not freshly made. Odd consistency of meat, not sure what kind of ground beef it is, it's not good at all. The sausage roll was still terrible. I gave it another chance but won't go back there, there's plenty of places around the United States that will ship & I would rather pay the extra money & have great tasting pies & sausage rolls than wasting my money & calories on that."}
{"text":"I've been in Scottsdale for many years and don't think I've ever stepped inside this storefront on Main St in Old Town Scottsdale.  There's always a first for everything.  It's a little bit of an odd space with a fairly large open dining area in the center and separate offices or retail along the side.  In fact, I wasn't too wild about the layout or the decor.  As you walk up to the counter you'll see the menu posted above and the sweet and savory pastries in the display cases.  I chose a sausage roll and it was pretty meaty and flavorful.  The service was friendly but the whole experience didn't really wow me."}
{"text":"All of the meat pies were good. Warm and tasty. Don't go for drinks unless you check to make sure the bar is open. Was closed when I went."}
{"text":"Thank you once again for opening.   I'm an Australian native who has been in the USA for 22 years. It's so nice to have a little slice of home. Your pastries are spot on. I'm very excited for your Aussie bar to open next door.   Thanks for the great service and food. I forgive you for being from Sydney lol."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for my bday lunch.  Good choice!  I got the Steak and Cheese Meat Pie (Chunky steak filling with cheddar cheese. Topped with cheddar cheese and salt and pepper.), it was great!  Tried a bite of the Sausage Roll (Flaky puff pastry filled with a ratio of 2 parts ground pork to 1 part ground beef.), It was delicious.  I also ordered and inhaled the Vanilla Slice (Vanilla slices are made with homemade thick yellow custard, sandwiched between two sheets of flaky puff pastry and topped with vanilla fondant and chocolate drizzle dessert).  MUST TRY if you love custard.  Only con was we had to wipe our own table down."}
{"text":"Found this place while wandering around old town scottsdale on a business trip.  No one told me that nothing in Old town Scottsdale is open before 10 and I with my jet lag was walking around at 8 am in the morning in like a ghost town.  The only little shop open was the bakery.  Great customer service ( they let me sit for an hour milking my meal and chatted about the place). They have small versions of some of the pies and I tried their mince pie, mornay, and the spinach feta.  All super tasty.  My favorite was the spinach and feta.  They make a yummy tomato ketchup sauce that is so good with the mince pie too!  Definitely a nice surprise to find an Australian bakery in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Food was 3.5.  Solid food.  The chicken curry pie was good; not great.  The rosemary chicken pasty was good.  Crust and pastry was great.   The lemington was perfect.    Ambience is slapdash.  Throwing a couple of Aussie flags and a stuffed kangaroo doesn't make ambience.  The space is huge and it appears that they are constructing a new bar.  But for god's sake, hide the work.  I can see bicycles ladders, construction material in the space next to the bakery part.    The space looks like they had a counter bakery with Basic tables and a construction site.  Ambience -- 2  The owner is very friendly Native Aussie but the staff leave me wondering if friendliness is just limited to the owner.   Customer service -- 2.5  overall a 3.  However if they add ambience and service this place could be awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Went in bought one pie to share with the family and walked right back in and we tried almost everything, my favorite was the stake and mushroom pie. The staff was very helpful and super nice also the owner Laurance was very nice and explain the idea he wants to the area with his business and his food. And the coffee it's excellent, they have their own blend, lots of flavor and strong. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The iced caramel latte is so smooth and creamy. I love it!  I finished it way too fast, made me sad. Now I know where to go next time I'm in old town and want a coffee"}
{"text":"Ive never eaten Australian delicacies before, so this place was a welcome change to monotony! I enjoyed it. It is not a very huge with extremely well-done interiors. But the location in Old Towne Scottsdale and food flavours made it a great experience.  My husband and I ordered the Anzac Biscuit and Lamington to go with our Ice Tea and Coffee. The coconut goodness of the Anzac was really yummy! The Lamington is a simple vanilla sponge cake topped with chocolate ganache and coconut. We'll definitely be visiting this place again ... but we will opt for a to-go order, The Old Towne and parks nearby will provide great views of Scottsdale to enjoy with this yummy food!"}
{"text":"The Red Curry Chicken meat pie is delicious!! After trying out the food truck a few months ago, my boyfriend and I were constantly taking about taking a trip to the brick and mortar store. Well worth the visit! The staff are incredibly friendly and the food and drink selection is extensive and delicious."}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for a restaurant on Yelp. The meat pies are great and the owner is a nice guy from Sydney, Australia. Definitely a hidden gem in Old Town!"}
{"text":"The guy who started to serve us was fantastic friendly everything you would want from an authentic Australian eatery. This young man was wonderful. In fact the whole time we were there he was pleasent and engaging to the customers. The short woman was rude, angry horrible. For over inflated prices for take away food it was not worth the price. The chocolate eclairs had been down sized. We were now paying $4.00 for tiny eclairs. It was not the Aussie experience that you wanted. The place has no charm but do you expect charm from a take away shop. So the people who work there add to the experience. The young man certainly added to the shop but they need to rethink this womans role in the store, she is certainly not customer friendly."}
{"text":"A quirky, fun place for breakfast! The guy serving us was snarky but in a funny way, and since he forgot to give us our scone he gave us an extra! I wish they would have had fresh whipped cream instead of cool whip but overall a nice atmosphere with good coffee!"}
{"text":"The red chicken curry is so flavorful. The curry is a perfect Thai red curry, which is hard to find in the valley. The crust is perfectly made, not too soaky not too dry. I can use one hand to eat it, which means that the filling and the crust are perfect.   Another tasty one is chicken avocado. I cannot wait to go back to try different pies."}
{"text":"Grandma turned 90 and has always wanted to go to Australia. I heard about this place on the news and decided to pick up some meat pies, sausage rolls and desserts to bring grandma a taste of Australia.   Our favorites were the steak pie, curry pie and quiche sausage roll. For dessert the winner was the vanilla slice and we also tried the lamington and matchsticks."}
{"text":"Glad this place is here. Great espresso drinks and a variety of Australian baked goods including sausage rolls. There's even a koala in the tree. Dog and child friendly patio. They have a new bar inside for you to chug down your Foster's. You know you want to. So come check it out. Super friendly people!"}
{"text":"Found this place after walking around downtown.  Tried two different sausage rolls and a custard pie.  All were fantastic.  Will come back again to try a curry pie.  The lamington sample was nice bonus.  Soft sponge cake with ganache and coconut.  It was the best, most moist cake I've had in a really long time!"}
{"text":"I really should give this place one more try, as everything does look tasty, but in my case I guess I ordered the wrong item.   Firstly, the staff was very attentive and nice. The place is clean, but empty.   I ordered the sausage pastry, probably my first mistake, but it did look good. When I bit into it a glob of warm oil ran down my chin and onto the plate. The sausage no longer had a cooked appearance, but a rare to med rare look. Oil pooled out of its wrap and I immediately lost my appetite. So much for breakfast .  I've read many of the four and five star reviews at this location and I'm just assuming I picked a bad day and a bad product. I'm willing to give this place another chance, but it will be a while. And I won't be ordering that sausage wrap anymore."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery to enjoy some goodies and relax for a minute in Old Scottsdale. I'm always looking for a new spot for sweets, but this bakery has much more than just sweets.   The inside of the bakery was oddly spacious with the display of goodies in the back corner. There are several tables so that you can enjoy your delicious treats right away. The employee that helped us was quick to greet us and answered questions, but was not overly friendly.   We came in for sweets, but found that this bakery offers plenty of savory options too. The variety of meat pies and sausage rolls was impressive. Everything looked great. Next time I'll come for breakfast and enjoy the savory options.  My husband and I shared a Strudel that was filled with apricot. Very good! The pastry was delicious and the filling was not overly sweet. The Anzac Biscuit was my favorite of the two sweets though. It reminded me of the buttery, sugary flavor of an oatmeal cookie. It was a uniquely delicious cookie. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law ordered a small chocolate pie that they said was delicious too."}
{"text":"Great food, the Feta & Spinach Roll was fantastic. I had the Apple Strudel and it was great as well! Definitely recommend, can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I was told to come and try this place out and was told to ask for the Aussie from a friend.  Great little place to visit and get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love surprises, here there were a few:  1. Iced coffee was awesome, great beans, strong but not overwhelming, did not get watered down when iced. 2. Fresh authentic scones!  Get them with the raspberry and  the house made whipped cream, what a treat! 3. A whole egg in the quiche, was definitely a surprise, jury is still out on whether it was a nice surprise or not. 4. Service was outstanding, for Old Town,  that definitely  constitutes a welcome surprise!"}
{"text":"Very good, flakey pastry! The inside of my Bacon Cheddar quiche was a little bland. Service was good, and quick."}
{"text":"I had no idea that pasties are an Aussie staple as are Pies and sausage rolls I kid you not. Don't believe me go check out this Australian Bakery in beautiful Old Town Scottsdale.  ~Red Chicken curry $6.50 (marinated curry chicken, slices of onion, bell pepper and mushroom, in a spicy coconut sauce. Topped with red paprika powder) ~Chicken Mornay $6 (chunks of chicken sautéed with carrots, corn, peas and red bell pepper, creamy cheddar sauce) ~Chicken Cheese Avocado $6.50 (chunks of marinated chicken sautéed with carrots filled with slices of ripe avocado and cheddar cheese) ~Rosemary Chicken & Potato $6 (Chunks of chicken, in rosemary lemon marinade stuffed with garlic roasted potatoes in a flaky pastry) ~Apple Turnover $4 (Apple pie filling in a flaky puff pastry)  The chicken curry pie is the winner hands down! All pies/pasties are generously stuffed with chunks of meat and are about $6 which is very affordable.The crust is flaky and the pies are fresh. The Apple turnover had a soft crust with powdered sugar and the right amount of sweetness.  I can't wait to try all the other items on their menu.They also sell frozen pies and rolls which you can warm at home.I visit them frequently and the quality of pies/pasties is consistently top-notch.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's on my bucket list to visit Australia sometime, but for now eating their cuisine will be the best I can do! This cute little shop sells savory and sweet pies. The mouthwatering pie selections are mainly chicken and beef savory options, with a few vegetarian pies and desserts. I opted for a chunky beef pie ($7.29) and tried a few other items. The pie had a crispy flaky crust and well seasoned beef in a wine sauce. The beef was a little chewy but overall it was enjoyable. I also tried the sausage roll which I think is the best deal for your money ($4.50). It was filled with a lot of ground meat encased in flaky pastry. The bite of shepherd's pie I had was equally tasty and filling as well as a beef and vegetable pasty I tried a bit of.  Drinks are by the bottle and are in a fridge off to the side. In addition to Coke products they have Australian ginger beer which had a spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.  We finished our meal by sharing an apple turnover. The dessert had been refrigerated so the dough wasn't as flaky as the savory pies but I did enjoy the sweet fruity filling.   The decor is basic but cute with lots of photos of Australia, kangaroos and koalas. There is plenty of seating and we had no problems dining in on a Saturday early evening. Note that they close at 7 PM each day so get here early if you want to dine for dinner.  Overall this is a great inexpensive and fast option for food if you're in Old Town Scottsdale. I'll be back to try more pie!"}
{"text":"Here it is. A coworker last week asked if I wanted to go with her to the Australian bakery around the corner. I've never had Australian food before, and wasn't feeling up to trying it.  I had brought my lunch to work but went for the walk anyway.  We get to the café and OH MY GAWD. The sights, sounds, and smells.  I was intrigued. I walk up to the case and it was all over.  2 of my favorite food flavor profiles neatly packaged up in a fracking flaky crust!  SIGN ME UP FOR A SPINACH AND FETA ROLL!     One bite and it was over.  I'm a fan!  The crust is flaky and tender, And the filling is savory and creamy.  Flavors are seriously on point. (channeling my inner Guy F.)   I may have a GAB problem cause I've been here now 3 times since last week. Dang you co-worker for widening my lunchtime options and slenderizing my pocketbook.  LOL"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Cheap Eats, had the minced meat pie and it was awesome. Definitely a place you have to try the place is loaded with good treats. Service was great fast and friendly. There was also a nice bar inside place which was a nice little surprise for a night cap."}
{"text":"4 to 4.5 stars.  This place was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I both thought the food was really delicious and high quality.  The prices are a little too high, IMO, on the dessert items.  For the meat pies, it's fair.  Steak and mushroom pie was very filling and only one small piece of tough steak, honestly a lot more flavorful and good steak than I expected.  Bacon quiche and sausage roll both great.  I loved the apricot streudel, filling did not come out of a can and it was not too sweet.  The pastry dough is well made.  All the desserts were more like asian-style low sweetness, which is what I prefer.  Lamington, custard pie, and Anzac was good, not blown away.  Be careful not to over-order like we did, the items look small but they are dense and filling.  Cold brew was very strong!  If you are sensitive to caffeine, stick to the small size."}
{"text":"I love this place and come every week to get a delicious sausage roll, but they raised the price $2.00 so I guess I won't be coming as often. I can understand a need for price increases but 40% is more than I want to afford. I hope the increase will offset the loss of my business."}
{"text":"The sign outside says best coffee in Scottsdale so we got the cold brew. It's very similar to Nordstrom's blend, which is my favorite. I got the steak curry pie and it was delicious. It's like a pasty, empanada, or piroshky. The crust was buttery and flaky and held the deliciousness in without it falling apart. The baked goods also looked good too but I didn't have any room. They're adding a bar and more food options inside. Definitely check them out if you're looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"loved the curry one. expensive though. hard to justify getting one."}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar offers great food and drinks. I tried the Red Curry Chicken Meat Pie, it was the best thing tasting food I ate all week. I combined it with the imported ginger beer. You have to try them."}
{"text":"This place is like walking into a bakery with all the items in a display case and ordering what you want and sitting down at the tables to eat. No waitress.   It was only us when we were in there so it felt weird but with my husband being part Aussie we couldn't refuse the selection of pot pies.  Between 5 of us we had the Sausage roll, couple steak and mushroom, couple curry pies, a minced meat pie, and for dessert we tried their apricot strudel.   The pies hit the spot. We were all so full.   We walked around the town after and was well satisfied with these Pot pies.   A Yay to say come on in and trying this place.   If I lived here, I'd recommend popping these in the microwave for 10 seconds so they'd taste like they came out the oven. Same with the desserts, after placing them in the microwave so it's nice and hot place a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They are huge enough to cut into a few pieces. Your dinner guest will love it."}
{"text":"I'm being generous because I didn't try any of their pastries, just the savory stuff, and that wasn't very good.  One problem may be that it is not freshly baked, such as you would get at the nearby Cornish Pasty Company.  Another issue is that the fillings are one-dimensional - they need spicing, accent ingredients, etc.  The dough, too, is without character.  I hope the desserts are better."}
{"text":"The name suggests greatness, and as a pastry connoisseur I was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately my expectations were not met...  I thought it would be a neat little bakery in old town, but it's basically just a casual deli environment that isn't very inviting. I decided to order a bunch of pastries to go for our family dinner that evening; I went with a some quiches, a curry pie, a beef pie, a pasty, a sausage roll, a matchstick, a turnover, and a lamington. We were all anxious to dive in, but were all disappointed with the mediocre flavors and quality of the pastry. They were all decent, but nothing truly great. Out of everything we tried I would say that the matchstick and sausage roll were the best. On the bright side the prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice and helpful.   If you are looking for a quick bite this might be a decent place to do so, but if you want a great pasty or other pastries there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"Being from New Zealand, the name drew me in and I was pretty excited to see the selection of classic down-under bakery fare, all the favorites from my childhood - pies, scones, custard slices and lamingtons. All things that you would be hard pressed to find outside of Oz or NZ. I got a chicken pie and a lamington. My kids, who were skeptical of a pie with meat in it, were pleasantly surprised. My son said \"this is delicious!\", and it was. I talked briefly to the owner who was super friendly and said he's going to start shipping pies soon and was in the process of expanding to include a bar with down under beer and wine. My only regret is that we lived in Scottsdale for ten years but I never made it to this place before. I'll certainly be back whenever I visit Scottsdale though. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Old Town Scottsdale.  They are fairly new, only open 3 months but are delivering some great tasting meat pies and desserts.  Limited soda selection but they are in the process of opening a bar so by the fall they should have more beverage coices.  I thought the sausage roll was a little on the salty side but it still tasted great.  Not exactly a great vibe right now as a sit down place but great food to go."}
{"text":"Nice open space in the heart of Old Town. The \"hook\" is an Aussie menu. There's an assortment of pasties, sausage rolls, and the like plus typical Australian desserts.  The chunky steak pasty was  tasty, as was the cottage pie.  The bacon and cheese quiche was good but didn't seem particularly fresh. If I return, I'll stick with the desserts. The lamington was tasty. Fresh sponge cake covered with coconut.  Nice!"}
{"text":"I had an okay lunch here a few weeks ago, but my mind wasn't blown away by the meat pie. I had steak and mushroom and the overwhelming flavor I had was Worcestershire Sauce, which is fine since I'm sure it's an ingredient, but it should not be the star player in the flavors.  I think if I come back I'll try something else and maybe also a sweet pie.  The customer service was friendly enough, which made up for the fact that the food wasn't a big hit with me.  I do feel I'd be in remiss if I didn't point out that my very good friend was raised in New Zealand and he says this is the closest he can get to a yummy meat pie from back home.  So there's that going for them in terms of authenticity too."}
{"text":"What a sweet little place in the heart of old town. The selection of meat pies is fantastic and then there are the desserts! so much to choose from, only one stomach! Have been several times and tried something different each time, they have all been fabulous.  TIP: get on their mailing list!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. We tried a sampling of the hand pies & desserts and everything was great. The spinach & feta hand pie and vanilla cake were my favorites! Definitely stop in and check this place out!"}
{"text":"husband and i went there last year when we was visiting inlaws. the food was good and amazing. definetly got to eat there again the next time we r in town"}
{"text":"Such a great treat in Old Town.  Unassuming little place that sprouted up in what was once a lobby for small mall.  Its a wonderful assortment of meat (and other) pies and desserts.  I had the chunky steak pie and it was out of this world.  I look forward to trying a few other things over the next few months.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"We are impressed with the quality and style of this fast self serve concept. The tidy display cases show off the perfectly proportioned turnovers, and rolled savory pastry. Traditional meat and vegetarian options, we had the Apple turnover which was perfect, not too sweet. The iced cold brew was tasty, but needs a shot of espresso to fortify. We will try it for lunch next time."}
{"text":"I downgraded my review from 5 to 4.  I love the location, I love the delicious food, the atmosphere, and the service.  I was extremely disappointed with the staff obviously not preparing for lunch.  I entered the building around 12:20 and the pickings were very thin.  There were no sausage rolls at all and the glass cabinet was sparse in terms of other choices.  In my opinion this is unacceptable.  If I managed this place that wouldn't happen.  I need to know when I go there that I can choose anything there on the menu, and it is available especially at the beginning of lunch.  I have a 1/2 an hour for lunch. Also it wasn't very busy at all, maybe 8 customers if that."}
{"text":"Seriously was soo excited when I heard we were getting some Aussie meat pies in town! We always get them frozen from New Zealand or Australia. But dang these are delicious. The food is great service was great!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the savory food because it was too salty and the bacons & cheese quiche was hard & crunchy. The sweets were much better. The counter person was friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Food to die for, been here everyday for a week. A taste of home for me. Great friendly staff, seem more like friends than staff. A must do if your in the area. Authentic Aussie tucker.  A M A Z I N G"}
{"text":"This place is a must-do in Scottsdale! We are locals from Tempe and came to try their food and pasties. Our expectations were surpassed with a delicious sausage roll, chicken avocado pie, and others! The Lamington dessert and apple turnover were perfectly made and I ate the rest of it!   The owner is so cordial and the staff was just as good. The owner came over to our table and put a small town home feel. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We were strolling around Old Town Scottsdale and came across The Great Australian Bakery. They offered a wonderful variety of \"pies\"and we opted for the beef curry pie and the cheese and bacon quiche pie. These were very good. The crust was very nice as was the filling. It would have been nice if the pies were hotter but this was a big deal as they were lightly warm. I also thought their coffee was very good.  I did not try any of the desserts but my wife did and she liked it. It was a flaky layered crust filled with a vanilla custard. We are glad we found this spot and it perfect for a mid afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"This is clearly a bar that needed to find a way to generate revenue during the day. The pie/quiche is ok. Not very flavorful.  My buddy describes it as an $8 hot pocket with beef stew in it.  The staff was very friendly so that is a plus"}
{"text":"The only way this place could improve is if it were in Australia. After living in Australia for 5 years myself, these pies are authentic and delicious. A little pricier then what I'm used to spending but it is to be expected and I feel it was worth it. We will definitely return time and time again!! I highly recommend you try this place - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! I didn't expect Australian Pastries to taste this good. Last time I went to Australia, all I ate was seafood and now I regret not having any of this during my travel.   My friends and I had been talking about coming here for quite some time now. Yesterday, we've decided to drive up here and give it a shot (even though the wind was 30 MPH outside). The restaurant looks like a small food court. I saw at least two other retail stores sharing the same space at the end of the alley, but it doesn't bother me at all. I was there for good food, not for trying to get fine dining experience in old town Scottsdale like other stuck up Scottsdale folks do (comments as reflected on other yelpers review. I just have to say something). I've done quite a bit of travelling around the world and found that some of the best food is served at places such as this. You should judge the place by it's food & services, not where it is located. ANYWAYS, service was great and welcoming. Workers were hardworking even towards the end of the night. Since we've never been there, they waited for us to pick what we wanted patiently without giving us an attitude for it.   There were so muxh to choose from i didnt even know where to start. I asked them which pasty on the shelf is the most popular. Apparently, it's the sausage pastry. The pastry was soft and flakey. The sausages were well seasoned and tasty. I didn't think that small size one was going to fill me up but it actually did. I also took a bite of everyone else's. They were all just as good.   Ill definitely come here again especially for their sausage pastry."}
{"text":"You need to find this place!!!  It's not often that a restaurant opens in Scottsdale that rings truly unique...The Great Australian Bakery is filling that void!  Although \"meat pies\" and \"pastys\" aren't purely original, this place does them PERFECTLY.   The Shepherd's Pie is insanely tasty and the Red Curry has a great blend of curry and comfort.  Save room for dessert because the Apple dessert of greatness is worth the trip alone!  So glad Scottsdale has another good place to hit up!"}
