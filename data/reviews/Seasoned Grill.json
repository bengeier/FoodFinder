{"text":"The Phoenix Burger with a fried egg is my favorite. The wings are delicious and so is the rest of the food. Good beer selection for a small local bar. Good daily food specials as well."}
{"text":"Going into this bar I was super unimpressed by how small it was. Then i began meeting more and more friends up there and began to realize its become like a second home to me. I love the DJ's and karaoke that they have on the weekends and of course, you can never go wrong with $1 beer night on wednesdays!! And they also have the best fries!! But unless you know people from northfield or macedonia you really wont fit in much. But its definately worth checking out a few times before you make your decision on whether you like it!! It grows on you!"}
{"text":"Love Seasoned! Kelly is the best bartender ever!!! Go here try the apple pie and the food is amazing! i always recommend seasoned!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and is always a good time. They seriously have the best burgers and wings in town! Specials all the time and a good pool shooting crowd. Dollar domestics and happy hour."}
{"text":"This can vary between 3-4 stars depending on what you order.  Their loaded chili cheese fries, if you realize you are going to eat unhealthy anyhow, worth it. Soo good.  Their wings, these are good as well. I just think the fries are even better.   What's nice (or not depending on what you are looking for), is they are small enough a place and will hook up regulars a bit more. Also the apple pie shots that are homemade are literally perfect.   They transitioned cooks a bit ago, but apparently trained the new one pretty well because after a while it was hard to tell the difference again in taste of food.  Also, they have pretty good steak dinners on Sundays (their special).  Above average for bar food easily, however don't go here and expect it to be head and shoulders above it."}
