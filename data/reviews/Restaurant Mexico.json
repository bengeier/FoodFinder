{"text":"Went there on a Thursday with my family from out of town. Wanted to show them a good Mexican restaurant and was completely disappointed.   We walked in and waited for a table for about 10 minutes. That's not so bad normally except that the restaurant was nearly empty. Got seated and the chips were stale and cold, salsa was watery and bland. Went to use the restroom and they were out of toilet paper. Luckily I noticed before I sat down. Got out and told our waitress, waited 6-7 minutes for tp to get stocked. Ordered the beef and chicken floutas, they were tasteless and had very little flavor. The meal also came with the usual rice and beans as well as a little pile of guacamole. I found a hair in the guacamole.  When I confronted I waitress about it she was very kind and apologetic then went to show her manager the hair. I overhead their conversation and the manager saying \"Another one?\" They came over apologized and took the meal off of the bill.  So overall my experience with RM was one star. However considering the fact that my family was satisfied with the their meals and had no problems along with the courtesy of the staff, earned them one more star. Would I recommend this place to anyone? No."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. I've been coming here since I was a baby and it never disappoints. The sopes and green cheese enchiladas are amazing. I love the salsa and everything is fresh including the guacamole that I always add a little salt to but love that the don't over salt for you. Clare burro is great too! This isn't your average Mexican American place but it is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time. It's quick, reasonably-priced and great! Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went in because they were next to a shop on Mill, to our delight, it was Really good!  Some of us are vegetarian and they had quite a selection. The Clara burro and beans were awesome. For the non vegetarians in the group they loved the special chicken Mole, and great flan for desert. Although my friend got the last flan, apparently it goes fast, it would be a bummer if they were out and you came for it. Our waitress Sherry was really nice! Not fancy atmosphere for an impressive date, but very clean.  And they serve Beer. Will try to make this a future stop again."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOVE RESTAURANT MEXICO!!!  I grew up in Tempe and have been going to Restaurant Mexico for as long as I can remember, at all of its various locations over the years.  It is, without question, my favorite restaurant in Arizona, and the best Mexican food out there.  The wait staff is so nice and has worked there forever.  The food comes out super fast and is always hot.  And most importantly - DELICIOUS.  Their enchiladas are amazing - with queso fresco (not gross yellow cheese) and green tomatillo sauce... oh man.  So good.  Now that they're back on Mill, the location is great.  I can't recommend this place enough.   Go, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I was disappointed. Took an out of town visitor there and I am embarrassed. The place was pretty empty would should have been my first clue. I had a combo plate. My cheese enchilada was cold. The chorizo tostada was not bad. Overall, boring food."}
{"text":"Okay, so it is HARD to find mexican food in tempe that is like what I have with family in Mexico. Every time I'm craving some plain frijolles de la olla (beans, whole) I go here. I keep coming back for the burro clare. Don't come expecting some fancy restaurant but it's great for a yummy lunch.   One thing is that their salsa is kind of lacking and a side of guac will cost you your first born, but other than that everything I've had is delicious, including their margaritas.  Once we went and I met once of my favorite artists, Crystal Castles, hanging out having some margaritas before their show at the marquee! I figure this is probably a rarity as usually the place is pretty empty. The service is awesome, the girls there are SO nice and helpful."}
{"text":"The food was great.  We had to find a server.  The chips & salsa, shrimp bowl & chicken tortilla soup was excellent.  The water tasted horrible.  The drinks were great!!"}
{"text":"Most Mexican food snobs or \"foodies\" would spew guacamole out of their nostrils at the mere mention of ground beef tacos BUT at Restaurant Mexico since the '70's this is what I order like 4 out of 5 times (80% . You didn't know there'd be math on this quiz, did you? Well DIDJA?!).       The Taco Duros with the picadillo aforementioned ground beef with teeny-tiny bits a taters, topped with lettuce, sauce and queso blanco in the fried tortilla is the best ground-beef taco going.  And the only gb taco I eat.       The mole also is well above-average, as are the bean & guacamole enchiladas. Never had a sub-standard enchilada here; always tasty.  Decent chimichangas, and a good change from the usual is getting the chimi topped with the radioactive-colored red sauce.  Not spicy, just visually roja-radioactivio.  Harquahala.  IF ya know what I mean.       The Salsa - not as red red as most, not very spicy, but tasty and worthwhile.       On Mill in the midst of a busy buncha stuff, good neighborhood atmo.       Later."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know."}
{"text":"Nice, unique little mexican restaurant. The food both tastes and looks unlike most Mexican places I've been. The food felt very fresh, chicken was right off the bone, tortillas were chewy (very flaky when fried), and salsa and guacamole were homemade (if a tad under seasoned, but still very tasty). Great location too."}
{"text":"Authentic!  All in all, this gets 5 stars.  It's simple and I don't go there for pampering.  I go there because it's cheap, fast, and oh so good!  They use the real Mexican cheese -- queso fresco.  None of that oily American crap served at just about any other so-called Mexican food restaurant out there.  If you don't know the difference, then you're used to eating Americanized Mexican Food, you don't know the real thing, and you should continue to eat at the ...berto's out there.  Yes, their salsa ain't chunky.  Authentic Mexican salsa isn't; if it is, it's called pico de gallo. Their chips are certainly decent enough, but I don't go there for the chips.  Their wait staff has gotten to know me and while they've always been very nice, they really warm up even more when a friendly face comes to eat.  The staff isn't perfect and sometimes they get frazzled, but the food is always consistent -- always!  A friend who never likes to eat at Mexican restaurants because they never taste like his grandma's, always loves Restaurant Mexico.  He says, it's good and authentic because it's so simple.  I brought his sister here after she'd been in Hawaii for months without the real stuff -- she couldn't believe how authentic it was.  Did I tell you the food comes out fast?  Yes, FAST!  I recommend #5.  I also recommend #3 with green sauce.  Yikes, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic mexican food!  Service is EXCELLENT--exactly what you would expect from a small, friendly establishment.  And...I'm craving the salsa RIGHT. NOW."}
{"text":"After a disappointing first visit, my husband and I went back a second time, since reviewers seemed to rave about this place.  We were sorely disappointed a second time. We were practically shoved over to an empty table, by an impatient, impolite and apparently overworked woman who appeared to be part hostess, part waitress, part cashier.   The chips were stale, the salsa looked like tomato juice; it was so runny you couldn't even scoop any of it onto one of the crusty chips.  I ordered the enchilada, taco and tostada combo and maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the enchiladas use Cojito cheese which does not melt well and does NOT belong in a traditional enchilada. The tostada had more potential since it contained chorizo and refried beans, but the beans had very little flavor and the chorizo was so greasy the tostada broke in half. When I asked for some more napkins (politely, mind you) the hostess/cashier/waitress told me \"when I get a chance.\" What gives??  I really don't understand why so many people write positive reviews about this place. The quality of the food was like something you'd find at a fast-food place and the service was non-existent. The only consolation was that the meal didn't cost much. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Restaurant Mexico since I was in college. Whenever I am in town on business, I go there. It is fantastic. As to the lower starred reviews, take those with a grain of salt. If not two grains of salt. Comparing authentic Mexican cuisine with Filiberto's is like comparing Nordstrom's to Walmart. (RM is obviously more Nordstrom's)."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on an episode of \"Check Please Arizona\" and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Went with my husband and a friend, we liked the food but it was lukewarm at best. My rice wasn't cooked thoroughly.  I will give it a star or 2 on ambiance and service, great staff."}
{"text":"I heard really great things about this place and I was willing to overlook the fact that it took them 10 minutes to seat me (a party of two!) when there were about 5 empty tables...except that the food just was not very good.  I went on a friday when they have the \"amazing\" chile relleno for their special of the day, and I love a good chile relleno, so I ordered that.  Wow, was I disappointed.  There was pretty much just a solid mass of cheese inside, it wasn't melted or even warm!  The batter was greasy and the sauce was more of a tomatillo sauce.  I give them two stars instead of one because the beans and rice were good.  Even the chips and salsa were just meh.  My dining companion had a chimichanga that just had meat in it, and he said it was pretty boring.    The only good thing about going here is that it's right next door to Paletas Betty, which is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant all my life through all its different locations. I have never had a bad meal or bad service. And while I live a very far distance from this place and dislike parking in the mill ave area, I still come here at least once a year for my birthday. It is also the cheapest sitdown restaurant I have ever been to. I prefer it to any other Mexican restaurant. The taco suaves are amazing."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love these beans. They are as close to nana's as it gets! Friday's CHILE RELLENOS ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. CLARE BURRITO & GREEN CHILE ENCHILADAS are also great. Expect Queso Ranchero and serrano chile flavors. Family favorite."}
{"text":"Watch out you Gringos! It's The Real Deal! I've been going to Restaurant Mexico for over 20 years. Raised in Arizona, I've had my share of Mexican food all over the southwest and Mexico. This is authentic food that is fresh and home made! The queso is delicious especially in the cheese enchiladas with green sauce (I crave them!). The cold guacamole salad is perfect on a hot summer day. Since I've had nearly everything on the menu, I won't go on and on, but try any of the dishes and see for yourself. Don't expect your average Mexican food though. This is *not* the bland, grease-ridden American-Mexican food you find as a default all over the US. Nice choices, great service so, go try the real deal already! :) (PS: If you are expecting the average Mexican food you always eat around town, then you may not be happy with the real deal. Expand your mind and stomach!)"}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favorite places to eat in Phoenix Metro.  The atmosphere is casual, the crowd diverse, and the food is cheap, good and one-of-a-kind.  Try their Monday night special (a pumpkin sauce?!).  If you don't want chicken, get the sauce on the Clare Enchilada (my favorite), mmm mmm."}
{"text":"I should only order enchiladas @ Carolina's, I guess, because I am always disappointed when I order them anywhere else.  One star for excellent service, one star for awesome beans, one star for serving Pepsi, and one star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.  Found the popular American music an odd choice...Stevie Nicks is not what I expect to hear while I'm noshing on chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are complimentary.  And the salsa has a slight bite and is very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you can't make a good shredded beef hard shell taco in Phoenix, Arizona....you don't deserve to call yourself a Mexican restaurant. The shredded beef, in the tacos I ordered, was hard chewy with no flavor. I took one bite and the meat stuck together as it came out of the taco. My small bite turned into a big mouthful of flavorless chewy shredded beef. That one bite turned out to be  all of the meat in the taco too  Let's just say lunch was super fast today  I should've eaten the wrong order that I was first brought when I had the chance"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had. Their beans are simply delicious, and their rice is my favorite! They offer two different types of cheeses--you can get the yellow cheese or the crumbly white kind and wow, both are delicious! The staff is so welcoming and friendly, and always up for a good conversation. Very well priced, too! It's not often you find quality Mexican for a good price, and this place has it! I had a wonderful experience and will no doubt be back here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The enchiladas in green tomatillo are superb, the tomatillo is more sour and spicy (which I love), but using the cheese they do balances out the flavors. They have great beans and rice. But, my personal favorite has to be huevos rancheros. I have a hard time ordering anything else.   I visited Restaurant Mexico the night before last with a friend who was craving Mexico City style. We were fully satisfied. What we didn't realize is that we came in just before closing. But, we didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, they refilled our bowl of chips and salsa when the food came out.   I've lived in Mexico City and the flavors here are the closest I've found in Phoenix to the food I would eat there. This in mind, the sauces accent the flavors of the chiles and tomatoes more simply and without sugar. Sour and bitter flavors can be part of the overall allure of these type of sauces, hence the \"watery\" salsa that comes out with the chips. It is a simple tomato and chile salsa without frills, but that is the style.    The only complaint I have is the enchiladas are a traditional small size. That said, I could probably eat a platter full."}
{"text":"Love Restaurant Mexico. I have been eating here for over 10 years, actually more like20 years, in three different locations. Clare burro is terrific, beans, avocado and green sauce. The guacamole is fresh and chopped rather than the green puree they serve at most restaurants. I also love that they don't melt a giant wad of american cheese over the top of everything they make, like most Mexican restaurants seem to these days. They only down side is the chips are terrible, always have been. But everything else is great."}
{"text":"Wow, not such friendly reviews.  Maybe I can help.  It's true, the mexican food you receive here is not what many are used to in that its not as spicy and the menu is limited.  However, if you want to try the REAL mexican food instead of the Americanized, \"cookie cutter\" versions that surround the rest of the town, Restaurant Mexico is the ticket!  It's a mom and pop joint with friendly service and wonderful hospitality.  True, the restaurant is lacking in decor, but it is clean and gives it a small town restaurant feel.  The food is on the lighter side and doesnt leave you feeling bloated when you leave which is great in the hot Phoenix sun!  I recommend the cheese enchilada combo with the green sauce...delicious!  The cheese is light and the texture is wonderful.  It's the first time when eating an enchilada that I actually slowed down and savored every bite!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was poor made. Service was sub par. Will not be going again.  Had a Carne asada burrito and a quesadilla with rice. Quesadilla was good; beef in burrito tasted a bit old."}
{"text":"This place is a Tempe landmark. I've been eating there for years and the food is fresh, delicious and healthy. The enchiladas are outstanding as is the guacamole. The green sauce is addicting. The place isn't fancy but the food trumps everything here."}
{"text":"This may have been the freshest taco I've ever had in my life!   High quality chicken, freshly made tortillas and made to order guacamole!  I have a relatively mild palette so I can only imagine how amazing the more adventurous food on the menu is for people who like many different types of Mexican food.  EAT HERE!!!  You will not be disappointed and the host and server were both very friendly.  As I said, my palette is tame and my server was very sweet, accommodating, and my food was exactly what I ordered.  Truly delicious!!"}
{"text":"Endless bowl of chips and salsa; too bad the chips were not warm though. We had an early dinner there and just after we seated ourselves, three more parties came in and two of the parties were greeted by name and one of them mentioned that they had coming there for over 20 years while the one of the other parties said they have been going there for years and years.   Food was yummy, I should have asked for beans, they were especially good!!!   I used the ladies room before leaving and have to say that they have one of cleaniest restrooms around!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Been coming to Restaurant Mexico since the 1980's (they've moved several times). Food is very fresh and very flavorful. Service is always great! The only thing I seem to have to repeat when coming here these days is to ask them to warm up my food upon arrival. Not sure why it is always not hot enough...thus, the four stars."}
{"text":"Restaurant Mexico is a Tempe institution, I have been going there since the 1980's as a student at ASU. This is not your typical Sonoran style food, Restaurant Mexico's food is unique dishes from Mexico City. From the crumbly, creamy jalisco cheese, to their green enchilada sauce, Restaurant Mexico is delicious and different. Pipian Monday, Green Corn Tamale Tuesday. and Mole Thursday are my favs, but I won't turn down a whole bean Clare Burro (whole beans and flavorful guacamole) or a Pork Taco Suave. The servers have been there for a long time, which says something very positive, and treat you like family. Truly my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here about 2 times a week and am always treated like family. The food is extremely good, and always tastes very fresh. Definitely a great place to check out if your on Mill Ave, and want something other than \"Big Corporate\" food."}
{"text":"This place is overrated by some, and overpriced given the quality.  Starter Salsa is runny and bland. So called \"steak\" is the thinnest piece of beef I've had in a restaurant.  Food presentation is non-existent.  If this is called \"authentic\" Mexican food, it really is a humiliation to Mexican cuisine.  If you don't want to feel ripped off and still hungary after eating there, pls stay away and save the regret!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Mexican food this good in L.A.  Don't expect standard Mexican food drowned in gooey cheese-they use a different type of cheese that crumbles on the top.  I had been going there since they opened up in 1978, and whenever I am in Tempe I have to go there.  Their green enchiladas with tomatillo sauce are addictive and very spicy!  And their beans- heavenly!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. We really enjoyed the Machaca and steak fajitas. Handmade tortillas was delish! We had quick service and the food came out quickly. Definitely, would eat here again."}
{"text":"yep...restaurant mexico is back on mill avenue...been here for about twenty years, maybe thirty...it's authentic but not sonoran (that is what you usually eat when you eat mexican food), super fast, locally owned and just remarkably good...not your standard overly fried (though sometimes that is tasty) americanized mexican food...white cheese, not yellow, super fresh, lovely salsa, guacamole to write home about....RM is my fave....and their new location is their best yet....try the clare burro......delish"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bit at lunch time! Their taco salads are the perfect lunch portions and the chicken is so flavorful. Their salsa has a bit of a kick to it, which is nice. Friendly staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"This is a yummy tucked away place. It's good if you want to get away from all the nonsense that can be on mill at times. This place reminds me of someburros (if you have ever heard of that restaurant chain) but with a more authentic feel."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! The service is great, food is quick and delicious. Reminds of of my Abuelas homemade Mexican food. Not fancy, just a good casual spot with simple tasty food and good people. My favorite is the cheese enchiladas with green sauce!"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful.   I could have dealt with the grainy queso fresco. I could have overlooked the undercooked corn tortillas. I was even partially amused by the eccentric (AKA somewhat rude) service. But when my girlfriend ordered the enchiladas with red sauce, it literally had NO TASTE. How is that even possible?  It just tasted like...well...red. My only working theory is that there are some five pound boxes of cayenne and paprika that have been sitting around on a shelf since 1973 and have completely evaporated any and all volatile flavor ingredients.  And to top it all off, the chorizo and the picadillo tasted exactly like Taco Bell beef. BOTH of them.  Never, never again."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ since I was 12 or so.  I've had most everything on the menu and never been dissapointed, but for the past 10 years or so, I've only strayed from the 2b with corn tortillas, (juevos al la mexicana), a few times.  Their salsa can't be beat....Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in the heart of bustling downtown Tempe. Service was good and they gave us more chips when we asked for them (sign said only one per table.) Try the chimichanga if you're into the that- mix it up & don't feel you have to rely on the meals to construct a tasty plate."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Plus there was an actual leaf blower in the back of the restaurant that left me uneasy"}
{"text":"I had breakfast for lunch here, and it was heaven-sent.  It was one of those days - when anything else just won't do.  I did the machaca scramble (basically a shredded beef scramble with bell peppers and tomatoes) with rice and frijoles and was very pleased.  The best part of this dish were the homemade tortillas -  I couldn't just have one (Lays eat your heart out, mofos).   While it was good, I've definitely had better.  A good choice if you're moseying on Mill.  It's location now is very hidden - but it's right next to Ra, and once I tell someone that, they know exactly where it is."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has 3.5 stars. What a disappointment! The food was bland and cold, the service was ok but my husband and I will certainly never return. Terrible"}
{"text":"2.75 stars:  Cute little mom and pop type joint on Mill Avenue (rare, I know) that's been around for ages. Nice people, good food, fare prices. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still better than your average fast food joint. Not a fan of their chips or rice, but they've got some good machaca enchiladas and their chicken flautas are tasty too."}
{"text":"Unforunately, I was underwhelmed. I read reviews prior to going to Restaurant Mexico the other night and I went in with low expectations. Maybe that isn't totally fair, but then again, that's why I yelp.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas. I ALWAYS order cheese enchiladas when it's my first visit to a Mexican restaurant. The sauce was bland (red), thus causing my enchiladas to be flavorless. Like many reviewers before me, the dish was lukewarm. My iced tea was the highlight of my meal. I don't think I would consider putting cinnamon in my iced tea but for that, one star.   My girlfriend had the green chilie burrito and seemed to enjoy it. She also had the chorizo tostada and liked that as well. Another star for her enjoying her food.  Service...meh. We were one of two tables in there. Our server was overly attentive.   I don't want to say I would never go back, there's always a possibility. I just won't be going out of my way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places--however it isn't for everyone.  If you want a big glop of yellow cheese go someplace else.  If you think you know better than the cook (i.e. you are going to tell the kitchen to put something in your food instead of what it says on the menu) go somewhere else.  If you need your Mexican food deep fried and \"enchilada style\" go somewhere else.    On the other hand if you have a sense of adventure and like to try new things you might really enjoy it.  Fast and friendly service.  A true madre and padre type of place.  I am partial to number 5 but I have eaten virtually everything on the menu at one time or another.  Thursday chicken mole special is a classic."}
{"text":"Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy, and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland, disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"So much to like here.  I know it's a favorite of locals, and college students.  They've got great retried beans. Good enchiladas, although a tad small, they- gasp! - used the right cheese! Woah. But the shredded beef Taco? I wound up doubling down on that bad boy, ordering another. Yes, I pigged out, and I was a very happy pig!  Tips- I'm more of a Calfornia (Sonora style) Mexican food guy- for the purist, this is more of a Jalisco style food found in, say, Mexico City and Guadalajara.  I forgot this, and got green sauce on my enchiladas. That was ok, but I was looking forward to the red sauce.  I assure you that I'll be back to try those too. All's ya gotta do is ask.   One shout out to the big guy that waited on me. His Spanish is great, but his service is spectacular. It's been months if not years since I've been waited on this well.  What an upbeat guy.  He makes it worth going. Tip well!"}
{"text":"Goodness Gracious Great Rolls of Enchiladas!   Every restaurant has its quirks. Come on now, this restaurant has history and some of you are attempting to judge without savoring the true essence of the place. Consider this: the menu has changed little in 25 years, the prices have had only minor jumps, but nothing major. Yes, the staff have job security.  I say: put in your time lil doggies and you will only be paid back; and,  might have learned something along way. This is NOT your typical mex restaurant.   A little back story about the quirkyness of this place. 30 some years ago, a girlfriend and I. after a helatious night of drunken bingeing and copius amounts of sex, staggered into the original Restaurant MO-HEE-CO and slumped into a booth,  feigning a migraine disguised as a hangover. We were greeted by a beauty hippy gal who immediately sensed our shattered bliss and quickly joined us in the booth! Looking over (what was left of us), the cheery gal said not to worry  and that she would be right back after she found out it was our first time there. One of the beauty of an on-the-ball server's is not needing to ask what we wanted, but just started loading us up. She returned with frosty Bohemian beer jars, from the freezer vasos and placed little bowls of red and green (warmed) salsas and hard as rock taco chips. Asking if we liked guacamole, and we hardly able to respond to little more than pablum; nodded to her with acceptance.   Meanwhile, one of the staffers looked right out of an image of Devo, Debby Harry, Talking Heads or maybe Brian Eno videos was efficiently working the regulars with his upbeat altitude. It was obvious, but not at the time, but we were watching someone truly unique, a man/server named Clare, from Planet Clare.  Meanwhile, our newest best friend and nursemaid, tended to our whims of wanting wonderful food. Who knows what we had exactly, but I had never tried Huevos Ala Mexicana, crumbled white cheese (queso ranchero) or tomatillos, or picadillo, or a freakin Sope for that matter. In fact, a quesadilla wasn't what we thought it was either. The only thing half familiar was the word taco and enchilada at that point. Then came the food. We ordered a lot of everything, cause we felt like going to the hospital, but were starting to feel the fog clear and the aromas from the steamy food, revitalized our senses. We realized we were on to something special.   Although I have eaten here more than 100 times lifetime average in 34 years and eat here less than I used to, I still recommend it to newbies, foodies, fooks and fools alike.   The reason nothing makes sense to the novice is that this is not Tex-Mex or Sonoran, but the flavors and dishes of Mexico City.... wha-tha you say? That's right naysayers, you need to back off, lower (raise) your expectations and take your time savoring this unbelievable, wonderful food. Fast food sometimes, but for the most part just consistent. And remember, the restaurant has been shoved to new locations over the years and still has the same choices and recipes.   During the old school times, I admit to ordering the same few items 20-30 (lifetime) times: first it was the heuvos ala mexicana. I soon learned that I could split the only available RICE or BEANS, Wha?? instead of choosing one. Relief!  Then, the next phase was to order soup beans 'a olla' (ala carte), which comes topped with cilantro, white onion and a a sprinkle of white cheese and add an enchilada or two on the side and always with green sauce. And for a delicacy We will enjoy the CLARE BURRO a delightful mix of soup beans&lt; chopped onion&lt; quacamole&lt; ciliantro wrapped in a large tortilla, slathered with tomatillo sauce and salty crumbled white mexican cheese. And of course, the Clare Burro, was named after then quirky guy server Clare....   Fork this!  DJBUB"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place this past Saturday. We were so disappointed.  Firstly, our server forgot about us after getting our drinks for us. We are very patient and understanding people, being that both of us come from customer-service heavy work backgrounds, but there were only 3 other tables being served at the time. When our server finally came back to our table to take our order, she even made a joke about forgetting about us. Poor form.  When she brought us our food, I realized she had brought me the wrong order. I as OK with that, but what I didn't like is that there are two kinds of enchilada sauce, and she didn't ask me which I wanted. Most places out here do red by default (if they serve verde at all). As I read this, I realize it may sound a bit snobby, but it's just a bummer when you don't get what you order. I've never sent any orders back and I don't want to, as I know it makes more trouble for the cooks and servers - so I usually just deal, but what I got wasn't even good.  Which brings me to my next point. Beyond the service not being that great, the food wasn't good either. The salsa is pretty much just tomato puree, and was cold. The chips were stale. I realize they're free, but even microwaving the salsa would have made it better. As far as the enchilada and taco, I didn't like them much because I don't like super fried food - but alas, I could have sent back the order and didn't, which is on me.  Anywho, the overall experience can be summarized with a raspy \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Straight up, son, we eat here like EVERY WEEK!   The chorizo tostada is on POINT!   The number 5 combo is my favorite it comes with the aforementioned chorizo tostada, a taco, and a bomb enchilada.  Get the green sauce on your enchilada, my ninja.  The cinnamon iced tea is the boom shpoof and i drink like 4 of them mugs before I leave.  Take your posse over and visit with the ultra friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is a downtown Tempe institution.  I love it.  I've since moved away, but it's always my first stop when I'm back in town.  I will admit, it isn't for everyone.  You have to appreciate simple, homey, Mexico City style food, in contrast to the Sonoran style Mexican fare (with gloppy cheese) that is typical around here.  The salsa is perfection to me, but if you like chunks, you're out of luck.  The chips are thick and homemade, so if you like super thin, uniform chips, you're out of luck again. No melted cheddar, but plenty of fresh, crumbly white cheese (either Queso Fresco or Queso Blanco, I can't tell) that is addictive - if you're used to it.  I know many people who had to acquire the taste.  I prefer the whole beans (topped with onions, cheese, and cilantro) to the refried.  The tomatillo sauce is perfectly tart.  The rice is my favorite Mexican rice in the world - drier, no chunks, simply spiced.  Watch for the specials - the chicken pipian has an amazing pumpkin seed sauce, everyone loves the chicken mole, the tamales are decent (different than you may be used to, drier), the chiles rellenos are great.  Service is always efficient and no-nonsense, and your food will get to you just moments after you order, even on a busy night."}
{"text":"Horrible waitress - extremely rude  We got up and left and completed about how rude she was  Made us all feel very uncomfortable as she yelled a disrespectful comment under her voice when she left our table. First time they're poor experience would not ever go back. If you're a family with kids and looking to have a nice experience don't come here not worth it"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his family personally know the people who run this place and have been regulars here for years. Given that I am half Mexican (raised on Tex Mex and Sonoran Mexican food), I tend to be more on the picky side when it comes to branching out and trying different regions of Mexican food. So my first time here I was a little on edge... it's definitely a different style than what I'm used to.  This is not your generic Mexican food (Carols O'Brien's, Macayos, Chevy's, Manuel's), this is authentic. If you're used to spice and flavor complexity, this is a milder, more bland (not in a bad way) Mexican joint. They use more green sauces as opposed to red, and queso fresco (white, crubmly, look it up) as opposed to cheddar or American. For those who can't handle a lot of spicy - this is probably the place for you.  While it's not what I'm used to I really enjoy their food. The waiters really make you feel at home. It's a great place for a family dinner with options on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"I went there with my fiancee and we went in as hungry patrons and came out satisfied.  The odor when you go in is not pleasing and the set up feels odd.  The first round of chips were complimentary and the salsa was hot but good.  We ordered sodas and found out that only one extra refill is free which is not good when you're eating some spicy salsa.    The food was okay, not great.  We had a chicken chimichanga, flautas, and Spanish rice.  The chimi was hot and really crispy and the guac and sour cream on the side were good. The Spanish rice was very light and fluffy.  The fiancee wasn't overly impressed with the flautas and that is coming from a flauta/taquito expert.    The bathrooms were about on par with all the bathrooms I've used on Mill Ave, which means you don't want to spend much time in there.    All in all, if you really want Mexican on Mill and you want more than Del Mar burritos or quasi-Mexican Z Tejas, hit it up, but I'd rather walk an extra few blocks and go to Macayo's Depot Cantina."}
{"text":"I've listed the Meat and Bean burro enchilada style as my last meal on earth.  What you order here is the key to your happiness.  I recommend the clare burro, the enchiladas and the taco's.   The margs are pretty much a bad tequila and off the shelf mixer, but will do if you want them.  I don't ever have the service problems that others have mentioned.  I go here every time i'm in town.  I wish I could get there more often."}
{"text":"It's very different than the usual Mexican restaurant. This is Jalisco style. Not Mexican American. Authentic. Portions are small and no melted cheese on the nacos or most dishes but Athentic crumbled mexican style white chees very mild flavored.  It was okay not bad but I don't forsee myself jonesing to return.  Margarita was a bit high and I don't think they use Tequilia and I didn't see a bar. I think they may use white wine, which isn't unheard of in small family owned places in Mexico."}
{"text":"The food here is godawful. Everyone I know that has been here had said it was bad. I wanted to see for myself. I can confirm it is terrible. I have a feeling that the only reason they're open is because they sell liquor"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday afternoon over ASU's summer break and was treated to amazing service. The women working the front were incredibly warm and welcoming and made sure we were never in need of chips, salsa, or drinks.  Clare burro with green sauce was fantastic. Loved the whole beans and how messy and flavorful the whole dish was."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in town. Had the Clare enchilada and potato enchilada with red sauce. Both were good. Hard to decide which one I like more. My favorite is the quesadilla. Different, more like a gordita but so delicious! The service is super friendly and it's a great place to grab so e food on Mill."}
{"text":"Over the years our family and friends have gone here, our kids now meet up with their college friends. It is always good! A Tempe classic. It is hard to decide which is the favorite, Clara burro excellent, Thurs Chicken Mole, and the Guacamole is always the best."}
{"text":"Guacamole is bland, needed lots of salt and salsa isn't very good.   I wasn't very impressed with this mexican establishment off the main drag. We were looking for some good chips and salsa with guac but were dissapointed. The food wasn't all that good either.   Yelp failed me on this one."}
{"text":"I'll leave one star just bc the waitress was nice. But seriously it has to be hard to make food taste that bland and unflavorful. It was horrible"}
{"text":"Overall, I was not impressed. The chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was not chunky, and my meal was so...lackluster. I ordered the Flautas Plate...which consisted of two, what seemed like microwaved, chicken flautas, rice, beans and some guacamole. The flautas were more like taquitos that you buy in the freezer section, the rice was good and was really the only thing I enjoyed, the beans were standard re-fried and the guacamole was quite bland. The other three people I was with all ordered burritos and really enjoyed their meal...so I'm thinking the flautas are not the shining star at Restaurant Mexico."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I attended ASU in 1971.  At the time they were located almost on the NW corner of Mill and University.  They have moved at least 3 times since then as the city has razed old buildings for new.  Any place that has been around that long has to be 5 stars, and Restaurant Mexico definitely is IMHO.  In fact, a few of the servers have been there since I found the place.  The food has never changed in all these years, not one tiny slip of quality or flavor.  It is quite different that most Mexican food places, in fact I've never found another like it.  I believe the food is of the Mexico City region.  The variety of Mexican food available to us in the Valley is amazing and I believe everyone should visit this place often enough to try everything on the menu.  We all have our preferences and I'm sure you will find a favorite here that will addict you to returning time after time.  Be sure to try the Chili Rellenos, which are only available on Fridays if you can get in before they run out.  They are made the real way, not just a folded omelette with a chili inside.  Check out the Beef and Avocado Tostada (Salpicon), and the Soup de Olla (soup style beans).  The service is always the best, although I have read a couple of reviews where that disappointed.  Some customers are miserable and not to be dealt with, and of course something could have happened one day.  A servers sudden absence, server having a general bad day.  Not sure what happened but I have never in 40 some years had that happen to me."}
{"text":"It was okay.  The chips were pretty bland and the salsa wasn't great but they were included for free.  It looked like the best option to get was the fajitas or the chimichangas.  The people in my group that ordered those seemed to be pretty happy with their dinner.  I got an enchilada and quesadilla combo and was pretty disappointed.  It really did not have much flavor.  Luckily, it was not that expensive."}
{"text":"Salsa wasn't good, our server was worse! She started out nice, until my friend asked if she had limes for her beer, she walked away saying \"that was a stupid question\". Then as she took our order I asked about the type of cheese they used & she was sooo rude! She was extremely rude! Food was ok."}
{"text":"Hard to think of a restaurant that has survived in downtown Tempe as long as Restaurant Mexico. Well, I guess Chuckbox and Jack In The Box should be recognized as well, but they weren't forced to move from place to place because of \"progress\" and redevelopment. Anyhow, the current location is basic and service remains decent. The real star of the show is the food. The enchiladas rule and the guacamole is yummy. This is a cool place. Props to them for hanging in there and outlasting most corporate chains in the area."}
{"text":"This has been the very first time Yelp has failed me. There is no reason this restaurant merits anywhere close to a four star average. I seem to think that people around here wouldn't know good mexican if it hit them (bit them?). I tried it after it first reopened at its current Mill Ave location and the food was horrible. Very bland and kind of cold. I have since stayed away, but after reading some very good reviews here on Yelp I decided to go back. I had the enchilada, taco, beans and rice combo (pretty much your most basic mexican dish). The beans were more like beany water. The rice was beyond bland. The enchilada was like eating cardboard wrapped around cardboard flavored cheese. The taco was the best part with some sort of flavorful beef. The chips were alright but the salsa tasted like cayanne pepper & water.   This place is just another disappointing restaurant on Mill Ave. The area must be cursed."}
{"text":"Not good. Friends had chicken and it was boiled chicken, no flavor added. Service left something to be desired. Other friend had a salad and it was teeeeeny. Will not be back or recommend."}
{"text":"Restaurant Mexico was a place recommended to me long ago by people familiar with AZ food when I was first coming to town. I have been there many times. The food has a great home kitchen flavor and is on the more authentic side than most Mexican food found in the US. The service has been hit or miss on my visits, but is generally okay. The food prices are very low. It is easy to fill up on great tasting food without spending more than $5-10 per person. Chips and salsa come free at the start of the meal and are pretty good. My favorite item is the chorizo. I recommend getting it on tostadas or just as a side bowl with a few tortillas to fold on your own."}
{"text":"It is amazing how often this restaurant has had to move because of development in Downtown Tempe, but I think they've found a place to stay.   It has everything you look for in a great restaurant; great food, great staff and great value.  Their daily specials in particular are a great way to have a good meal for very little money."}
{"text":"This place has over priced unappetizing  food. Ordered two tacos one beef and one chicken. The meat in the tacos was old and tough. The chips tasted like cold cardboard and the salsa might as well been ketchup. The guacamole was pre-made and tasted like nothing. Go to fuzzys or hefe literally 100 ft away and get yourself some real Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food ever, the chips and salsa were awful, I had a bean burrito enchilada style and it was just not good, my step moms food was cold, the service very slow I would not return :("}
{"text":"A long time Tempe staple, Restaurant Mexico is true gem.   This is not Northern Mexico/Sonoran food. These are from family recipes from the region around Mexico City. All of these reviews claiming inauthentic food are from dumb know-it-all's that have never had anything but sonoran style.   The food is spiced very differently. Words like quesadilla refer to something entirely different. Once you let go of your filibertos based preconceptions you are in for a treat!  I usually recommend the #5, #6 or Clare Burro for first timers. Either of the combos will treat you too the incredible chorizo. This delicately spiced meat is much more subtle in spice and more finely ground than its boarder land counter part. The #5 will offer the chorizo atop a tostada, while the #6 will present it on their sope. Here a sope is sort of like a tostada with fried masa instead of a fried tortilla. Finally the Clare Burro is a whole bean burrito with avocado, an amazing house green sauce, and the always spectacular white Mexican cheese.  Restaurant Mexico is not a gastronomical hipster adventure. It is not a sonoran greasy spoon. Restaurant Mexico is deep central Mexican comfort food. It is your abelule's kitchen."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this one! DELICIOUS, cheap, authentic Mexican food. Definitely one of the best real Mexican restaurants around here. 12/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"\"I give it four thumbs down.\"  This place is an enigma to me.  For some reason, people rave about this joint.  I've been here twice and felt like I was being shafted when I ended up paying money for the garbage they served me.  At first glance the place looks promising, sporting your basic mexican menu with all the classic combinations.  However, upon ordering an enchilada, flauta, or taco, this joint nose dives.  Bland is the best way to describe this place.  The salsa is laughable, and the \"hot\" salsa isn't even one alarm.  They don't offer a real bar or much beer, so try their \"margarita\" thing for a huge disappointment.    I can't understand why this place hasn't gone belly up, but I guess that's why I can't understand folks promoting the joint either.    Fili B's is better than this, no lies!  Anyone giving this place 5 stars should be grounded from yelp for a month because there is no way that this place deserves it."}
{"text":"3 dollar roll tacos....way over priced. Total rip off. I get it its mill but damn...i hope people notice other Mexican restaurants. I don't know what's keeping this place open still..."}
{"text":"The salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like, I don't know, Agent Orange?  It doesn't taste good.  My tostada was swimming in a pool of grease.  My enchilada was decent.  The taco I had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart.  It had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums.  Goddamn, everyone who works here is so nice.  I feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really, honestly, not very good.  I am not a picky eater, really.  I am easy to please.  If I tell you a place has lousy food, then man, you are gonna shit your pants."}
{"text":"Food is good, lots of flavor and spice. They refer to this style of food as Homemade Mexico city and Jalisco style. If you're going for lunch its a little spendy but they have a a few combos under $10. You can also order items al a cart. for about $3 each taco, enchilada, etc. They have a few breakfast dishes w eggs, chorizo. I ordered the fajitas w/ rice and beans My lunch w soda plus tax and tip came to $18. So if you prefer quality over price this is the place for you. If you want value you should look elsewhere. You get some chips and salsa while you're waiting for your food. The service is nice and the food came out quick even when they are busy. Located off Mill Ave in Tempe so there is limited parking meters, garages, etc."}
{"text":"Everything here is relatively tasty.  Nothing we have tried has been bland, with one exception:  That dang watery salsa that comes with the complimentary chips.  The salsa has a decent taste, what little taste it has; nothing bad can be said about the taste. But the consistency is just awful.  Completely chunkless.  And fairly bland.  Service is super fast.  No, really, I mean ULTRA FAST.  You'll get your food generally in under 5 minutes, unless it's a steak which has to be cooked for a while to get done.  This place would get 5 stars easy if they improved the salsa.  I take my teens here a lot."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious dinner with Mom and a friend.   Fast service  Immediately greeted  And holy cow the food was amazing  You want to feel like family at a restaurant and get great food.    GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This is truly the best Mexican food I have ever had, and living in AZ, that's saying a lot. I was introduced by my friend who's family has been going there at least once a week for years. Once you get to know those who work there, you realize they're not rude like people say - they're friendly faces. As for the people who prefer the cheap orange Mexican blend cheese you find in overpriced chains, they really don't deserve to review this restaurant - queso fresco is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Have you had the Fajitas???   The staff is all hispanic, the food is authentic and tasets great- also the prices are cheap to fair!  Yes, don't go if your in a hurry or at 12 noon, (hence 4 stars) but it's really a great place. Put extra quarters in the meter. Take your time to relax and enjoy the cute simple decor, great food and happy smiling service you get. I go often, and enjoy supporting a mom and pop type of place!"}
{"text":"Comfortably, friendly, inexpensive, delicious, welcoming, spicy, filling, clean, homey, loving, cute, fresh, fast, institution, reliable, familiar, guacamole, beans, sopas, salsa, and flan.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"My dad used to eat at the original location in the late 70's so I gave it a try.  Only had one carne asada taco but it was the juiciest most flavorful bite of carne asada that I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I love this place! The waitresses are amazingly fast and friendly and the food is delish!  I always order #3 which is the enchiladas with red sauce. They are as close to Mexico as I have been able to find here in Arizona without having to go to some hole in the wall place.   Come and give it a try! This is a perfect spot for lunch, the food comes out super quick and hot!"}
{"text":"I love Restaurant Mexico! They have the best beans in the world!"}
{"text":"This place I totally forgot about. A friend use to take me here years ago and I forgot how good it was. The chips and salsa are ok, but not the best. This is not gourmet/fancy mexican but it is good and VERY affordable. The tostadas are great and the chimichangas are good also. If you are looking for some cheap good mexican, for sure check this place out."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in about 5 years or so, last time I was here was when their location was over on university.  They got moved out by Tempe selling that location to build a high-rise condo thing that failed and now that location sits as an empty lot (except for one building)  Anyways.... went here for a lunch meeting suggestion.  Place was pretty busy, we didn't have to wait to get a table but it looked packed all the way back at lunch time on a friday.  Good deco. Clean. Very busy mill ave vibe. Lots biz lunch meetings going on and yet it remained a good volume in there to have a meeting and hear everything fine still.  Ordered food and got it out on the table fast.... no I mean like FAAAAST!  I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes MAX.  Like FAST.  Okay you get it I know.  Service was very friendly as well.  Hard to explain but the food was light... most mexican food you walk out feeling like you have a bowling ball in your gut... Not here... It didn't seem greasy like most places and everything up to the tomatoes were very fresh and crisp.  They used Asadero cheese on top, which is super good, not many places use it anymore.  Not the Gringo cheese you get like at macayos or anything.  The rice was really good and flavorful too.  To view the flip side of this review... I wasn't a big fan of the chips and salsa. Chips seemed semi-fresh but really thick, I like a lighter tortilla.  The salsa was just a red sauce.... tomato sauce with some heat... no chunks...  It seems to go with the \"light\" theme I mentioned earlier but I ended up not eating much of it at all - just wasn't my thing.  I like fresh tomatillos onion etc etc....  If we could do half reviews this would be a 3.5.  I gave them the shove to 4 because Restaurant Mexico is kind of a downtown Tempe staple - they've been around a long time and that's gotta count for something in this town."}
{"text":"Inside tip- ask for a \"Claire Enchilada\"- beans and avocado for a refreshing and one-of-a kind flavor.    The crumbled cheese is a fresher, healthier, and more flavor full way to prepare Mexican food- I will forever prefer this cheese over the gooey, slimy, fatty stuff used by other Mexican places.    For desert, be sure to request them to set aside a flan for you (otherwise they tend to run out on busier nights).  It is a secret family recipe that the woman who makes it for them refuses to ever divulge.  Again, this is unlike any flan you've ever experienced before.    Happy eating!  Warmly,  Kirin :)"}
{"text":"Suavemente, Besame Yo quiero Restaurant Mexico besandorne otra vez  Suave, besame besame Suave, Yo quiero Restaurant Mexico Sauve, Okay-O I don't know Spanish Sauve, but I really like this song  Besame indeed, man I was totally hungry walking into Restaurant Mexico!  This little shop down on Mill Ave.  After a few drinks or two.  This place hit the spot.    I can't say it was the best I ever had.  However, the service was really good.  I ordered the basic taco meal with beans and rice.  Like most Mexican restaurants they offer free chips and salsa.  Salsa was good and the chips seem pretty solid in a good way.  My taco entree came quick right after I order leading me to think of it like cafeteria food.  I guess it was so quick I had in mind some lady slopping it onto my plate while smoking a cigarette.  I'm sure that's not the case.  Moreover, my tacos were good.  Nice shredded beef in a deep fried taco shell.  My favorites were the rice because they were a tad bit different from what I was used to.  Mexican rice is generally pretty bland, but here it was nice soft and sweet.  One of the best I've had I must add!    Overall, experience at the Restaurant Mexico is good.  It's right in the heart of college town so my surprise was the pricing.  I guess when I went to college long long long time ago food was much cheaper!  Wow kids are rich these days! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go here because we were kind of getting tired of some of the other joints on Mill. We tried this place thinking that you CAN NEVER go wrong with Mexican food. BOY WERE WE WRONG! The service here was deplorable, seeing as our server was reading a book rather than keeping track of our food, water, or needs. The food was bland and not appetizing. The \"quesadillas\" were not quesadillas, but some sort of weird bread without cheese, meat, or anything for that matter. The salsa was watery and old, and all of our food was cold. The waiter said they were \"authentic.\" I was with two hispanics and an east coast foodie, and none of us felt that any of it was authentic. My friend also found a hair in her chimichanga. The ambiance is lackluster and boring. This is one of those places on Mill that needs to get with the program or LEAVE. There is no place for something so grossly unneeded in Tempe. They should honestly put a new restaurant or bar there."}
{"text":"This is not the best food- no matter what the reviews say.  The chips were stale and salsa was like spicy ketchup.  The food was edible but they only allow one refill on soda and add 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.. won't be frequenting this place anytime soon"}
{"text":"Restaurant Mexico is Mexican food for people who don't like spice, or warm food.   I've tried several items here and I always feel the same, like I'm eating air. Everything seems watered down and flavorless. What I do love about this place is it is a family owned spot and their food is very simple and some people probably love that.  For me, I want to taste the garlic and I don't want my guac to consist of basically squashed avocados and tomatoes.   My usual suspect is the Clare Burro. It has lovely whole cooked beans and is topped with a tomatillo salsa. Sounds good right? Well, it always seems cold, the salsa is thin and I just never feel satisfied by the flavor.  The quesadillas are very unique in that they are Mexico City style so it is a bunch of corn meal that has been deep fried and the meat is inside. NO CHEESE! HA! It is very good if you're interested in sort of a fried tamale sans cheese.   The one thing on the menu that IS really good is the flan! Oh the flan is the silkiest and smoothest flan I've ever had with little caramel crunchies on the edges. ! Interesting fact ! They don't make it in house!!! That's right, the one thing on the menu that is good is brought in by a local baker lady who makes flan deliveries once a week. Put that in your chalupa and smoke it."}
{"text":"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi."}
{"text":"I drive all the way across town, from Arcadia to Tempe for Restaurant Mexico's green corn tamales. Alright, it's only a 15 minute drive, but I'll tell ya, I'm drooling the whole way. Rumor has it that \"the man\" is going to tear down the whole block to build a high rise, I hope and pray that Restaurant Mexico relocates to the empty ice cream joint over on 38th street and Indian School so I can just walk across the street for its yummy awesomeness. I had to take away one star because the salsa is inconsistant, when it's good, it's awesome but when it's not it resembles watery soup."}
{"text":"Really like the green tomatillo chicken enchilladas, service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Restaurant Mexico is an institution that has food you will crave for years. I love their food, and I get excited when I know we're going.  I've/we've been eating there since 1980. It's not sloppy Tex Mex. It's delicate but very flavorful authentic Mexican food. I get a number seven, with creamy crumbly Mexican white cheese, wrapped in tortilla and covered in flavorful, green tomatillo sauce, a crispy perfectly seasoned beef, corn wrapped \"quesadilla\" (it's very much like an empanada), and creamy flavorful refried beans. It's not too greasy or salty, which I really appreciate. You can add a little of your own salt if you want to, so it's up to you, and just a little is all it might need to bring out a little more flavor without sending you into salt shock, like so many other places...yay! Their shredded beef tostada is also fantastic. Wash it all down with an ice cold Negra Modelo beer with a slice of lime. Heaven!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always very picky when it comes to Mexican food and this place didn't really impress me at all. I ordered the number 4, a taco with some type of pork meat in it and was disappointed that there was barely any meat in it at all. The flavor was overly salty and it also came out luke warm.   The service wasn't bad though, the waitress was nice and the place was nice too.   Overall won't be coming back here...overpriced and nothing special about the food."}
{"text":"Went to this Mexican food restaurant due to Yelp reviews I've read recently.  Sort of a mom and pop simply decorated place - yet, service was great, and the fajitas I ordered were great.  Home made tortillas added to the flavor and taste of the meal.  I appreciate a good meal served competently at a reasonable price.  These things were met at Restaurant Mexico.   I will go back on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Slow service, weak margaritas and stale chips. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I think this video sums up my opinion of this restaurant.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df0BXSnBr1Q&feature=related"}
{"text":"Average Mexican food.  Tortillas are really good and the best part of the meal.  Wait staff very friendly.  I had fajitas, the spices were good, however the quality of meat was poor."}
{"text":"A few years ago I transplanted from So Cal to the not-so-deep South, and as you can imagine, the quality of Mexican food plummeted. Apparently there's a deep fear of spice in my neck of the woods, unless it comes as a shot of Fireball. In any case, I was eager to find a run of the mill Mexican eatery that wouldn't require an Uber drive and this restaurant was rated modestly above average. Unfortunately, although the dishes I ordered looked good, the flavor was completely lacking and apparently unadulterated by seasonings and spice. I smothered what I could with tapatio and a touch of salt, but honestly I could have done the same thing with a can of beans. The tortillas were definitely tasty and service was prompt, but they alone can't save a meal.   Conclusion: hopefully my dish was the runt of their menu, but if not and if you are at least remotely familiar with authentic Mexican, you best take that Uber ride elsewhere."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.  They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.  If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's."}
{"text":"Really bad Mexican food. I give it 2 stars only because of the cheap price. Tacos were awful. Coming from San Diego this food was really bad. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is a cute little family restaurant located right in the middle of the downtown mill ave strip.  There food isn't the best I've had, but isn't bad either.  If you are on Mill and want sitdown Mexican food then come here I guess...  Might go again sometime but I am in no hurry."}
{"text":"Don't know how I missed this place for so long. I've worked on Mill Ave for over 3 years and never made it to this restuarant and I have to say that now that I have I will probably be there more often. I had chicken enchilladas with a side of rice and really enjoyed it. Perfect balance of spice (in my opinion) and flavor. It wasn't overpriced either which makes it a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday $6.95 lunch special!!  Started with complementary chips and salsa.  The salsa was very good!!  Had a shreaded beef and a chicken corn tacos with rice and beans.  I definitely recommend the taco special!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on a whim earlier this summer because we were craving Mexican food and it looked nice and authentic. It was quite possibly the worst Mexican food either of us had ever had. There was a ton of people finishing up eating because they had just come from a softball game or something. My friend and I ordered the flautas combo meal, both which came with guacamole. It came out right away, but it was stone cold. Like it had been sitting there, maybe they were anticipating someone from the game would order the flautas meal but no one ever did, and they gave it to us instead? The outside was stale, the meat inside (shredded chicken and beef) was soo dry, tasteless, and crunchy (yes, crunchy from being left out for so long). Also, neither of our meals had guacamole on the plate even though it was supposed to come with it. So the waitress gave us $1 off each meal instead of bringing out some guacamole.:( The beans were so watery, it seemed like they were running out because so many people were in before we came in so they added water to them. Like we definitely could have used a straw to drink the beans. $22 later we hardly tasted our meals and had to leave because we could not physically make ourselves eat the food. We maybe just had a bad experience because we were coming in right after all the baseball/softball people were leaving, but still, neither of us would ever come back. The people who work here are super nice, if the food was decent I'd return."}
{"text":"I visited this location on Tuesday to order some authentic horchata (which cost approximately $3.75). I stopped in yesterday for lunch. You are given a complementary bowl of nachos with sauce (it looked like Tapatío). I ordered horchata and chimichanga (costs about $9.00 and tax). Both were extremely delicious. The chimichanga was nice, hot, and crispy on the outside. The server was also friendly and nice. The only reason why I docked a star is the cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise, I will return here for probably the most authentic Mexican food close to ASU."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!"}
{"text":"In giving Restaurant Mexico 3 stars I wish I could change the rating of A-OK to Eh-OK. It's not bad, it's not great, it's just Eh ( insert shrug here) OK.  Went there today with some co-workers. I've been before and realized I have not written a review. Probably because it's a bit forgettable. I got the shredded beef tacos with rice and beans. My favorite tacos are from Los Olivos so I use those as a gauge when ordering tacos. These do not even come close to Los Olivos. They were okay. Decent amount of beef but they were kinda hard to bite through. The whole lot of beef would come out when I took a bite. This made me look like a slob in front of my boss. Awesome.  The rice and beans are also okay, nothing special. The beans are kinda watery.   But to me the biggest disappointment is their chips. Chips and salsa can make or break a place and their chips just don't do it for me. They're really bland and kinda thick. But maybe it's good for my waistline because then I eat less overall. Trying to look at the positive :)  If you're in the area and craving Mexican head up Scottsdale Road to nearby La Fonda instead. They have pretty much the same stuff but better."}
{"text":"Mexico authentico! This is a real mexican restaurant. No gringo bullshit with sombrero statues and pictures of texan missions. Just plain old excellent mexican food. They don't drown your food in salsa, because the food is good. You could certainly put the salsa on your food, it doesn't belong there though...it belongs on your chips! Which they make there.  The Clare Burro is phenomenal, I have also had the chimichanga and enchiladas, but return for the Clare most often. Its got whole beans! So good...  Not only that, but Restaurant Mexico has been in business for over 25 years, has survived numerous losses of physical building location, something that has killed so many other businesses. Impressive, because of its impressive food!"}
{"text":"I stopped into this place for lunch while on Mill Ave for the craft fair. The service was great and the food was very fast. I ordered the huevos rancheros and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was very tasty, but the guacamole did need salt. I will return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Simple nice restaurant. This is a family owned restaurant and the staff is very friendly and they remember me every time I come in. Their daily special is always a good deal. This is by far one of the most authentic Mexican food restaurants I have found in the valley. Very casual atmosphere. Don't expect margaritas and tequila shots here. This is a true restaurant."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on \"Check Please\" and we had to try it. We ordered the # 5 & #6. Both were good. I didn't notice that the #6 didn't come with beans. I had to help my wife with her # 5 that has beans.  Next time I will get the #6 again (yes, I liked it that much) and order a side of beans. Guess you have figured out that I liked the beans. My #6 had a Clare Burro. This was a first for both of us and it was the first item that was eaten. Most likely I would order the same again.  Next time I will ask about the daily special. I could have gotten the Clare Burro for less by ordering the Monday Special. Service was fast, chips & salsa is mild and stewed. My wife commented that this is the first time she was able to enjoy the salsa. meaning that it isn't very spicy.  I like this place. It isn't overly \"draped out\", the food doesn't make you break out in a sweat or  take the top of your head off. The people are friendly and actually concerned that you like the food. Yes we will be returning. Oh by the way, FREE PARKING at 3rd & Mill, even though the lot says to pay. YOU DO NOT NEED VALIDATION. Restaurant customers park free ."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily bland food :(  for being on Mill Ave I hoped for better but...it didn't taste authentic at all unfortunately and the enchilada sauce was watery and looked like it had food coloring in it. Service was great at least."}
{"text":"Service on Saturday for lunch was quite good. Cheese and chicken enchiladas were pretty good, but the guacamole was very disappointing - really lacking in flavor.  It was an economical lunch, however."}
{"text":"Love this place. Originally from Chicagoland, this is the Mexican food we're used to. \"Authentic\" as this is how my family prepares our Mexican food. Tacos duros with picadillo all day. No yellow cheese or drowning food in red sauce here."}
{"text":"Ehhh. The service was great, very fast and nice. Margarita and michelada were tasty. However, food was just okay. I didn't like the way the chicken tasted. Seemed like it was boiled and tasted dull. The Clara, which is onion bean and avocado was tasty and a much better choice than any of the meat there. I was kinda grossed out. Also the salsa tastes cheap and chips were stale. Not planning on going back sadly. I wanted this place to be fresh Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I love places like Restaurant Mexico!  First of all, the food is amazing!  they have a lighter hand when it comes to the use of flavor conducting fats, not greasy at all!  I have eaten here twice now and it's always great!  the portions are actually people sized not gorilla or elephant size.  You leave feeling full and satisfied without the guilt of gluttony.  I ordered a carne asada taco dinner which was just what I wanted.  It hit the spot.  The tortillas were grilled and had a good toast on them but still soft and chewy.  The carne asada was well seasoned without masking the taste of beef.  The beans were excellent as well as the rice.  I love the horchata but I could have it less sweet.  The second time, i just had the carne asada dinner!  If you are hungry for beef but not need a full on 8 oz of meat...this is the meal!  My rec is to go and enjoy your favorite Mexican meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered #8 with shredded beef.  Luke warm food.  The meat was so dry it was like leather.  Neither of us finished our meal the food was so bad Waitress was pleasant"}
{"text":"I give this place 4.25 for being extremely cheap yet amazingly delicious! This is not your normal Taco Bell, Filiberto kind of Mexican food. According to my friend (who's actually from Mexico), this restaurant offers \"Mexico city food.... southern Mexican food\" My fav is #4. It's small but enough to fill you up for lunch. Their spicy, juicy shredded beef in the flour tortilla is to DIE FOR! And their beans and rice are definitely the best in Tempe! One of the best place for food on Mill."}
{"text":"First time in Tempe. Thought we'd try some Mexican. Located in downtown Tempe surrounded by a ton of other restaurants. It was fairly easy to find, but the nearest parking lot charged $5.  Food: The green enchiladas were pretty good. We liked that they weren't soaked in sauce and that the tortilla still had some texture. We also tried the Clare enchilida, which was recommend. It's a nice vegetarian alternative, but nothing too special. The meat burro was a good size but way too greasy. The beans and rice were pretty good as well but what was weird was that you had to choose either rice OR beans if you ordered the combo plates, not both.   Service: Service was fair. We were seated fairly quick considering the place was pretty busy, and we sat outside in the patio cause the weather was nice. The food was brought out in a timely manner, and was hot so that was good. The waitress was kind and it was nice that she left a pitcher of water for us, so that we didn't have to bother her for refills.   Conclusion: The food was fair, but the portions we're too small for the buck. GrooveSession will not be returning. Hopefully we could find a Mexican restaurant in Tempe comparable to the ones we have back home."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and never had a bad experience. Food is always great (although really greasy and unhealthy) and service is always great. Love the atmosphere.   The only downside is that they charge 1.95 for a side of sour cream! Biggest rip off ever. (This is where they lost 1 star) Most places only charge $1. I guess they have to make their money somewhere."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and didn't have much taste to it. I didn't even finish my rice and beans and I'm not a picky eater. 2 stars because I got take out and everything came out in a timely manner.  Would not go back in the future with the amount of other Mexican places within a 10 minute drive."}
{"text":"let me set the scene for why i did NOT enjoy eating here.  up on mill ave for a nursing class on the weekend...with about 8 other girls...walked in after wandering aimlessly for the first 15 minutes of our 1 hour lunch break cuz we are all indecisive bitches...enter restaurant mexico.  we sat ourselves in the corner booth and almost walked right back out when we saw the sign that said \"no split checks\"...we prolly should have right then and there.  after being reassured that we would be able to pay separately, we decided to stay...then came the chips und salsa.  three chips in, i got a hair, A HAIR, in a chip.  ugh...way to start on the wrong goddamn foot.  took forever for our drinks to get there, food wasn't expensive, and was semi-tasty...i got the chicken taco & rice, it was good...except the BONE i got in my taco.  i was so super done with this place by the time we were ready to leave...but then we had to tackle the issue of trying to pay our ONE check w/ 9 cards...UGH.  overall, place wasn't half bad, it just got on my bad side with the hair/bone/check issues.  nothing worth writing home about and i would rather have wandered around longer...big, fat PASS on this one in the future."}
{"text":"Restaurant Mexico has Jalisco style food. They have excellent service and unbelievable Huevos Rancheros! If you like great food and great customer service, you will love this restaurant. They also have fair pricing."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been going here for almost 6 years. As noted by other reviews don't expect a fancy experience this is simple, clean, non-greasy food without the gobs of cheese littering most Arizona Mexican food. This is not Tex Mex with Tina of sour cream, guacamole, sauce and extras. It's good old fashion Mexican that your family would make. It's fast, the service is great and I personally love their salsa. I'll be there again as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Now I understand why so many reviews trash this place. I don't think I've ever gone on a Sunday before, but what I got was: --Stale chips --Lukewarm food --Bare minimum of service  The waitress had clearly decided I wasn't going to tip, as I couldn't even get a drink refill or a \"how is everything?\" check. Now, I usually tip 20%, but when waitstaff is doing everything possible to treat me like a non-tipper, at some point, I shrug and oblige.  When I told her the food was lousy, she offered to void the bill, which is the only thing she did right; but I did eat it, so I paid because it's not fair to stiff a restaurant, even one that I'd never return to.  Basically, if you haven't been a regular since the 1960s (literally -- I was the only customer born after 1960), you can find better Mexican in Tempe, and you should."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot comprehend why anyone likes this place. The tiny bowl of chips they give you are almost as insulting as the tomato puree they call salsa.  Perhaps Sonoran stands for bland? That is the only way I can describe any item on the menu. Tasteless. They keep moving locations and I keep forgetting I don't like the food no matter where they put the restaurant.   Took my 80 year old grannie and she vowed never to return."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for lunch. I got the number 4 combo and a shredded beef chimichanga.. I liked the flavoring of the beef in the chimichanga a lot! We will be here again"}
{"text":"Horrible food! Horrible service! Waitress added $20 on her  tip after we left! Management refused to address the situation! Cause NSF fees! Do not go! Rip off! Scam!"}
{"text":"Food was simple yet tasty. Reasonable prices and fast service overall not a bad spot for a quick lunch or dinner. I wished they had more drink options at their happy hour though."}
{"text":"My mother can't live without the soup-style beans, and she's right. I get the Clare burro, which has queso fresco, whole pinto beans, and avocado. I also usually get some guacamole, which is very chunky here, and add a bit of salt to eat with the chips.   It's a family place for me, I don't ever really like it as much when I try to take other people, and this is the second move I can remember. My folks are sticking by this one, and I am happy to tag along!"}
{"text":"Cheap Mexican food on Mill Avenue.. we were looking for something quick on a Saturday night and stumbled into this place..  Restaurant has lots of seating inside and a back patio .. nothing fancy about this place, looks like it's been here forever..  The chips and salsa were nothing great.. chips taste store bought and the salsa, although tasty, looked like applesauce very strange.  The chicken chimichanga though was crispy and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.. delish.. served with a side of guacamole & sour cream .. it was very filling.   My bf had the carne asada burrito which he enjoyed.. but he really liked what was left of the chicken chimichanga better.  My bf said his burrito could've been hotter and the chorizo breakfast burrito although tasty was very greasy.   Check for the 3 of us was $28.. great deal!!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years and i really don't recall how it is.  just sat down down so I'm not sure how to rate yet, but strike one no coke only pepsi products lol. The house salsa is pretty good. I'm trying something new. They have something like gorditas so we'll see."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! My boyfriend and I went in to try it and got food poisoning. Their guacamole looked like it was put in a blender and had no taste. We even put salt in it, and their was just no salvaging such terrible food. This place should change it's name because it does not resemble Mexican food in anyway. Not to mention its over priced shitty food. WORST PLACE EVER!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to restaurant Mexico since I was a little kid. The staff is AMAZING it is family own and run and the same people have been working there for years. They are friendly and very accommodating. The food is authentic mexican food and delicious! The salsa is pretty spicy gives you a nice little kick. Since I moved away from AZ  every time I come back into town I ALWAYS make sure I go to restaurant Mexico before I leave!   AND they even have toys (little action figures and small toys)for kids to play with while they are at the dinner table !!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food's I have ever eaten, I aint no expert on Mexican food especially since I dont eat no meat, but I do droll over Mexican food and like I told someone who asked me what my most fav food in America was and I said, Mexcian (ironically, get it?). Anyway this place has great food, the alcohol is cheap as well. Get the bucket of coronas. They make their own homemade salsa everyday and oh their beans r excellento! It would have been 5/5 if not for the ambiance, which just to be sure is good, but nothing out of the box. It gives a authentic mexican feel though. The staff are friendly and will make you want to come back for sure again."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not an objective reviewer when it comes to Restaurant Mexico. This is the food I grew up with! My mom started bringing me here when I was about two years old, and we've stuck with Restaurant Mexico ever since.  That being said, the cheese enchiladas are the best ever. I don't like enchiladas with melted yellow cheese; these enchiladas come with crumbly, soft white cheese inside and delicious tomatillo sauce all over the top. I don't order the refried beans or the rice (lard, lard, lard) but I've been assured that the enchiladas are lard-free (and so are the yummy chips!) The chicken enchiladas are just as good.  I almost always get the green enchiladas, but when I'm in the mood to shake things up a bit, I get the Clare Burrito with lard-free whole beens and guacamole. It's also very good, but, like I said, the enchiladas are definitely my ambrosia.   Finally, the flan is unbelievably delicious!   Now that I live in California, I miss Restaurant Mexico like crazy. We have good Mexican food in the Bay Area, but not like this! Every time I come back to Phoenix, this is one of my first stops."}
{"text":"If you want the usual Mexican fare with lots of lard and cheddar cheese, don't go here. Si Senors delivers that style wonderfully (which I would also give 5 stars!) Restaurant Mexico delivers a lighter version that is incredibly tasty. I like their simple green enchilada plate. A light tasty green sauce. A light white cheese. The refried beans are great - not the whipped variety that you find at other places. Their chips and salsa are ... just ... different and good. You go away not with a bloated feeling, but with the taste sensation still lingering on your palate.  I have been going to Restaurant Mexico off and on for 30 years - at their first place on Mill, then off of Mill, and now back on Mill. I hope they are around for 30 more. Thankfully they have preserved the recipe for all of these years!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for close to 30 years and never disappointed!  If you're looking for lots of yellow cheese on your Mexican food, this is not your place; think authentic.  While many of the great places like Monti's are now gone, this place still delivers. if you haven't been here give it a try. Everyone is friendly and the food is fantastic.  and now.....back to my Margarita!"}
{"text":"The chimichanga is amazing, the flan is to die for, the food is the best around . Lydia and Bertha are the best !! 5 stars all around *****"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant for lunch . . . and since ASU was on Spring Break . . . we thought it would be a good time to try it out.  Somewhat disappointed . . . The service will prompt and somewhat attentive . . . seemed to lack a little, especially since the restaurant was pretty empty.  The food . . . The chips and salsa . . . the chips tasted burnt or at a minimum fried in old grease . . . the salsa however was very tasty and had a good amount of heat . . . I had the number 5 . . . the taco was crisp and tasty . . . the enchilada was also very good . . . the tostada was mushy and not very good.  I hate giving out three stars . . . since it is like riding both sides of the fence . . . but that is exactly what this place was like . . . some good and some bad . . . and while I have other Mexican restaurants that I would prefer to go to . . . I would probably try this on again . . . but would definitely try something else . . . maybe breakfast."}
{"text":"Not a great menu. Couldn't build a combo lunch of a taco and cheese enchilada?!?!  Cheese enchilada and rice were bland."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I have visited Restaurant Mexico on Mill Ave.  The service was quick on a busy lunch time on a Thursday.  The food was good, I had a shredded beef taco and beans.  I love the crispy fried taco.  A few other reviews mentioned the chips are cold, they still are but, they are nice and crispy."}
{"text":"The food is great! I could eat a Claire burro everyday! The serve is also amazing, the staff are friendly and welcoming. All of my friends that have gone feel the same way."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Mexican i have had i can make better food in my damn toilet   Chips were stale and the Arnoldpalmer was spicy"}
{"text":"After seeing Restaurant Mexico voted as the \"Best Neighborhood Mexican Restaurant in Tempe\" in the New Times: Best of Phoenix, I decided to give it a try.   I ordered tomatillo chicken enchiladas, with rice and beans, and a side order of flour tortillas. The entire meal was scrumptious. Immediately after receiving the flour tortillas, which smelled so fresh, I knew I was in for a treat. Apparently they purchase the tortillas from an undisclosed location in South Phoenix, and they were top notch. Next we move on to the beans; they were smooth and thin, with just the right amount of salt. The rice was moist and had a great flavor. Lastly, the chicken enchiladas are sure to excite the taste buds with a spicy tomatillo sauce.   Not only is the food delicious, but it is cheap too! Most entrees are $10 or less, which is shocking considering it is on Mill Ave. My expectations were surely surpassed, and I left Restaurant Mexico a fat and happy man."}
{"text":"Should have known by the empty restaurant on a Friday night that this wasn't the best.  Pros: portions good, good refried beans and rice Cons: salsa is terrible, the burros are boring. Enchiladas not so great, needed more sauce.  We heard all sorts of hype on the Clare and it's just avocado and beans. This place is just okay in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"If you looking for Authentic Mexican dishes this is your place. Casual restaurant for small or large groups. A large back patio that I discovered  it the far back of the restaurant. The menu is the traditional Mexican dishes. Chips and salsa are endless so don't get too fun. The waitress was very friendly and no pressure when ordering. I say a few other customers ordering margarita. That's my next visit here to try the margarita along with my meal. Just a tip be patient when parking this is Tempe a small stroll is worth this dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best beans in town. Their bean burritos are all winners. Try their clare burro. Their salsa is hot and delicious. I will drive here from Tucson for their good homestyle mexican food."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Mexican food in the whole world! I literally have been eating there for the past 36 years. The food is different than the greasy cheddar cheese Mexican food that most restaurants serve. This food is fresh, flavorful, and homemade. Mexico City style with the best retried beans. Their beans have won best of Phoenix awards. There is free parking in the lot north of the restaurant (3rd and Mill) even though the lot says to pay. Restaurant customers can park free YOU DO NOT NEED VALIDATION."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. The service was good, everyone was nice. I LOVE mexican food, and this meal was just ok, maybe I ordered wrong! I've had better, but I have had a lot of Mexican food..."}
{"text":"One word - \"icky\"  Not only did they mess up the entire order, everything was just.... gross. Their beans were tasteless, their tacos are NOTHING special. Rice is very tasteless too. Is it my fault I got a taco combo?   This place is a family owned shop, and a lot of people grew up with it and chased it around as it changed locations a few times. I was taken here with someone that grew up with it, and they loved it. But the novelty has to wear off sometime.  There was hair in my food, I'll admit. The wait staff was less than friendly, and can not customize an order worth beans - no pun.  I guess if you're on Mill and want a greasy treat while being drunk, maybe you won't recognize all the faults this place has. But hair? No split checks? Me thinks not."}
{"text":"Cons:  Horrible table salsa with the chips. Like Campbell's tomato soup. No flavor. Asked for a spicier salsa and was told that's the only salsa they have.   No traditional Mexican drinks like Jarreto.   My Corona beer came with a slice of lemon in the bottle neck. Let that sink in a moment.   Wife's carne asada came with a tasteless bean soup. She's Brazilian and loves beans, and wouldn't eat it.   Pros:  We came here for the food and admittedly it was pretty good. Wife's carne asada was good. My steak fajitas was good as well, with refried beans, rice, and tortillas. It was a thin steak chopped up, not really a steak steak, but it was tasty.   With a few refinements, this place could be a lot better. My wife is incredibly picky and only likes Mexican food. We passed by this place today and she said, \"Never again.\""}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Restaurant Mexico since I first tried it in 1997.    This is no Chevy's (gasp), Arriba's (no thank you) or Macayo's (hey, they have good... margaritas).  AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.  This is REAL Mexican food  (Mexico City style) served with a smile.    If you have a bad attitude, don't come here.  If your idea of a burrito is melted cheddar and refried beans in a flour tortilla, stay away.  If you're a snob... well... maybe you should do some introspection.  Restaurant Mexico serves authentic food which is not too heavy, not too spicy and not too pricy.    My recommendations?  Get the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and a side of whole beans.  This is my go-to dish.  If you're not concerned about lard, go ahead and get the refried beans.  DH SWEARS by them and has cravings for them... often!  Go to Restaurant Mexico for an authentic experience.  You won't be wowed by the decor.  You won't be stuffed beyond belief from American-sized portions.  You will not find the more familiar Sonoran style Mexican food here.  But you WILL have a good meal.    BONUS: If you have small kids, they even have an assortment of little toys/figurines your child can play with while you eat."}
