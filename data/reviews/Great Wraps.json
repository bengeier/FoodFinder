{"text":"Located in the Fashion Mall food court, I stopped for a big breakfast while waiting for a friend. $4.75 for 2 eggs (mine done over easy), two pieces of bacon (or sausage), a bagel with cream cheese (choice of onion, sesame, or wheat) was more than adequate. However the best part was fresh squeezed orange - it's why I'm giving 4 stars. Omelets and other breakfast choices are available. Don't know that I'd do lunch here, but would do breakfast again under same / similar circumstances."}
{"text":"By far the best food in the food court the prices are great very cheap I've had the breakfast and it is amazing the prices are really really cheap compared to the rest of the restaurants for breakfast and they have deals I've also had to lunch as well the meals at $10.05 that is a great price. Although my favorite wrap must be the Gyro it's lamb and beef it is the best thing in the menu and the best seller. I love the customer service from the staff every time I go there I feel welcome they're all very very nice."}
{"text":"Chicken strips are either great or just eh. Fries are amazing here. I enjoy eating here time to time. I wouldn't drive out my way for it though"}
{"text":"this place is pretty shady on the fact that i was asked if i wanted \"everything with that\" which cost +1 dollars.  it looked like a regular gyro with lettuces, feta, tomatoes...wtf was the extra dollar charge for.  pretty sub par food. small portions.  its just bad.  this is probably why there is no line and well the meat aint rotating... for close to 9 dollars this is a rip.  its near the strip so things are more expensive, but this is just a bad deal all around"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my go-to when I'm hungry at the fashion show mall and I don't wanna pay for over priced food for no reason.  Everything is fresh made to order, I always get the chipotle wrap on a tomato basil tortilla.  It's like one big fat short burrito cut in two.  Their a little skimpy on the fries but that's ok. The fries are just like hooters curly fries and go great with their little Tapatio packets they give you.  Next time you're in Fashion Show mall, just think... Non-dollar-menu items at Wendy's, or Great Wraps? Great Wraps!!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to eat when I'm done shopping at the mall . Their chicken strips are always so crispy and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about the Buffalo Chicken"}
{"text":"why am i at a food court in vegas? well, we were super hungry and needed to eat quick. there are long lines for this place but it's just ok. fills my stomach but leaves my taste buds wanting more. seriously, make time to go to a good restaurant. it's vegas!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 2, the picture menu is VERY deceiving. I ordered the Baja chicken bowl. It looked very festive and yummy on the menu, NOT. It was bland, had no taste until I put the chipotle sauce on it. I didn't get any salsa, just super disappointed, I paid 8$ bucks for this. Should have went to chicken connection like o always do. Thought I'd tried this place out. Smh"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!! Quick and very polite. Can't wait to try all their wraps. Chipotle chicken was awesome! Ultimate fries totally worth it. Free drink refills just like Chic-fil-A. Food was fresh and they will make to order if you are picky. We came to the food court just for this, not for mall shopping. Next door to Dairy Queen for dessert...bonus!"}
{"text":"First meal in Vegas...Great Wraps.  We weren't super hungry and since we'd been walking around Fashion Show Mall we figured - what the heck.  Out of all the food court options, Great Wraps had the most promise.  We got a couple wraps - buffalo chicken and gyro.  Both were alright, but nothing spectacular.  The buffalo chicken wrap was way too sauced and it bummed me out.  The gyro was surprisingly tasty for what it was.  Price wise? Maybe not so worth it.  But maybe that's what I get for going to a food court."}
{"text":"my first experience there was great! I never had a good philly cheese steak until I came there. the huge pictures of the food on the menu and the smell of the food is definitely what drew me in. can't wait to go back for more :-)"}
{"text":"0 stars. The old man overcharges on every transaction.  Check your receipt. He overcharged the guy in front me $1 and the customer was very upset. And what do you know, he did the same to me. When I told him he took my credit card receipt and walked to the back. They laughed about a freakin $1, the shop is breaking the law here.   Beware!!"}
{"text":"I ordered # 5 which is GW crispy chicken wrap! It was amazing, very very tasty! I live in LA but I would defiantly recommend and come back to this place! It is located in the food court inside the mall :) the gentlemen (Art)  who helped us was very nice!"}
{"text":"The food is great. It really is and I eat it almost every day because I work across the street. But the Costomer service really needs an upgrade. The suppose of owner that works on the register isn't so friendly. Doesn't greet you or just doesn't seem like she wants to work. Not sure what it is but makes me not want to give them any business. I would give the food a 5 stars. But the customer service is a 2 stars"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's fast food in Vegas. Come with low expectations so you can leave not disappointed?   Gyro platter. The lamb was too salty for my liking, but the pita bread was warm and soft since they heat it up just before serving. Give it 5 minutes though and it got cold and hard so eat it fast. The tzatziki tastes like sour cream with no flavor. They offer olive oil for your salad. Comes with fries.   Generally, a below average meal, nothing to boast about."}
{"text":"See, here's the thing: I am on a regimen, this summer.  A watching-what-I-eat, running-every-morning regimen.  It has some benefits; namely, the twenty pounds I've shed.  It does, however, make it a lot harder to eat out when running errands .  For example, earlier this week, I had just gone to the eye doctor at the Carolina Place Lenscrafters, and I was milling around the mall, waiting for my new glasses to be ready within the promised hour.  It was lunch time, but healthy food court options seem limited.  I finally settled on Great Wraps.  They had quite the line going, and they smelled good, so I figured they must be good.  My figuring turned out to be correct.  I had a hummus veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla, and while it wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, its quality actually surprised me.  The hummus was smooth and garlicy and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was affordable, too: you can get a combo for somewhere between seven and eight dollars.  If you're in Carolina Place, you should give Great Wraps a try."}
{"text":"Breakfast on the Strip for UNDER $10. Coffee, eggs, meat, Bagel, hash brown. Same thing at the strip hotels is easily over $20. Friendly smile and quick. Open at 9am. Located in Fashion Mall Food Court."}
{"text":"Lame. The food is not bad, but not much substance there for what you pay. The gyros are kind of a joke. They are very conservative with the meat. Like, very. And the thing is small as it is. And if you like your Z sauce with a little zing, be prepared for what tastes like plain yogurt. The guy in front of me ordered a Philly cheese steak. LOL. Looked like a slider. Even Subway does it better. These guys should take a clue from the Halal food carts all over NYC. Now THAT'S how you do a gyro."}
{"text":"After the Walk to End Alzheimer's at the Fashion Show, several of us decided to go to the food court for late breakfast/early lunch.  All of us opted for Great Wraps.  I stayed to watch our things at the tables and when some came back with their breakdfats from Great Wraps, I decided to go there too.  The breakfast special was $4.99 and consisted of 2 eggs any style, 2 bacon slices or sausage links, a bagel, and some hash browns.  The order was done in about 2 minutes.  The eggs were cooked as asked-over easy.  The sausage was standard and the hash browns were a oblong patty that was briefly deep fried.  The breakfast came with cream cheese for the bagel but it wasn't buttered.  The breakfast was OK.  A couple of things stand out.  In the need to be fast food, the bagel was only toasted a little.  I don't want it black but neither do I want most of the bagel to be just off white toasted.  Also, the hashed brown patty could have been fried a little more.  I guess to move customers along, the cooking is done a minimum amount of time.    It was OK, nothing more."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning.  This is inside the food court.  My bf and I walked here from the Trump Hotel.  We ordered the Thai wrap, which came with curly fries and a drink for under $10.  The wrap was good."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was supremely under-flavored. I have never had such a bland tasting Gyro. While eating the lady next to me had an emotional support pet that wouldn't even eat the French fries. Not only that, but the super racist African American cashier was the icing on the disappointing cake. She had her bluetooth in her ear he entire time and wouldn't even look at us. I couldn't tell you what she said us but I do know she mumbled and rolled her eyes awful lot. I had to experience this terribly racist woman and then suffer through their terrible product."}
{"text":"In a mall food court, your typical options usually consist of a burger place, a pizza place, a chinese place, an ice cream place, and a few various other places serving less than healthy food.  So when I visited Carolina Place for the first time in forever and saw this store, I thought I had to check it out.  Great wraps serves wraps made of everything from turkey, beef, and even hummus.  Included in the wrap are things like lettuce, roasted peppers, tomatoes, and various other toppings.  They have great options for anyone who is trying to eat somewhat healthy.  Just go easy on the sauces, the fries and the soft drinks.  That's where the unhealthy parts come into play.  But I will give them this, the fries are decent and instead of dumping salt on them, they have 6 shakers of different spice blends for you to top your own.  For the wrap I opted for a California chicken wrap which was stuffed and loaded with flavor.  They did go a little heavy on the Feta sauce though.  But I'll know better for next time.  And more impressive is the man behind the register who I think was an owner giving you a heart-felt thank you and inviting you back again."}
{"text":"i tried a sample they were giving out and i was suprised i really liked it so i bought a wrap, came with fries and a drink. not so expensive. it filled me up. if i ever go back to that food court at the mall, i'll prob eat that again."}
{"text":"Its aight.  Nothing interesting about it.  No one was in line = bad food.  It's your average wrap fast food chain."}
{"text":"The cashier, Roger, took my order was super enthusiastic, helpful, & friendly. When I walked up he was offering samples & I took one expecting it to be cold with no taste, I was proved wrong. They also sell delicious smoothies as well! I was asking another employee about the different sauces in the wraps & he heard me and even hooked it up with the hot sauce! DEFINATELY COMING BACK."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I got the California Turkey. It was a little runny. My gripe was with the guy who checked me out. All I  ordered was a wrap, it was in the bag yet he proceeded to hook his friend, who was awkwardly hanging around, with some friends. I had to wait for him to simply swipe  my card. I didn't  have the best first impression...but I  was hungry."}
{"text":"20$ for two breakfast platers is a great deal!! It is very good and filling. Two eggs, bagel and cream cheese, sausage, and a hash brown."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a Caesar wrap so I came here. After tasting a chicken wrap sample, I was sold. When I sat down and took a bite, I instantly gagged. This was the saltiest wrap I've ever eaten in my entire life. Now I'll have to spend the rest of my Vegas night bloated from all the sodium I digested."}
{"text":"As a Gyro connesuer I had to try one at \"Great Wraps\". Not very good for what you end up paying. Skimpy on the meat and the Tzatziki sauce was bland. Menu board is not what you pay because they charge extra for things that should come standard on a Gyro."}
{"text":"I come here often. I always get the euro wrap which is very fresh and good but after today i am done. These people are never friendly especially the horrible black cashier who stared at me from the minute I wake he up. The rest don't speak english. This place loves to charge you extra for all kinds of little things... It says \"combo\" with a photo of a coke and fries and then they say oh fries are extra. Well then what is a combo? Bullshit. It's bad business to nickel and dime and flat out dishonest to charge more after you said the price no matter how much. Don't give these people your money."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. Wraps were just as bland as you would imagine at a food court. Let's just say my hi-c strawberry lemonade had more taste than the wrap itself. In the end I was full but unsatisfied. Like I said you shouldn't really expect much from a food court, but I like a little flavor in my food. But hey, the customer service was okay and that's where that one star comes from."}
{"text":"Went there today and I noticed that they have new fry bags and I personally find them inconvenient because using the spices are hard to spread evenly. I simply asked how come they got rid of the styrofoam containers. And the guy at the service was being really rude. His expression tone and word choice said \"deal with it\". I also noticed when I got to the car they use STORE BOUGHT ketchup. I would understand if this was a single restraint but there are multiple locations for Great Wraps. At least the fries and spices were good."}
{"text":"Cheap and on the strip. The old man at the cash register was really nice. My fiance is a vegetarian and she had a delicious falafel hummus wrap."}
{"text":"Great Wraps is the perfect wrap with fresh and delicious flavored.  Located in food court of mall and surrounded by many other popular food chains, but if you really want fresh and tasty, I'd recommend Great Wraps from a person traveling on business and tired of fast food."}
{"text":"I had the classic gyro wrap and it was quite good. Service is average for a good court, not extra friendly or rude."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food is delicious and the place is very clean and the price is fair. Definitely will be my go to when Im at the mall."}
{"text":"Whenever I am at Fashion Show Mall and I am hungry, I usually stop at Great Wraps. Every wrap and sandwich I have tasted has never been disappointing. It is a cheap and tasty. My favorite is Cheesy Chicken Wrap.  One cool thing I do is order fries and ask for one of their sauces to use as a dip. My favorites are the Honey Mustard and the Chipotle Sauces.  One sucky thing is they charge for refills.  Overall, this is a great way to start or end a shopping day."}
