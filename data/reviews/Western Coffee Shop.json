{"text":"Known to some as \"The Donut\" because they used to have a tiny plastic drawer with donuts with a sign \"Donut\" on it. 

Always amazing service here by May and William who have kept this place one of my favorite places since 1993 or so. They close yearly around Christmas to repaint and to add $0.05 to some menu items. 

Food is great. When you order a sandwich or stir fry it has real chicken or turkey and nothing reconstituted. Home made wontons on Saturday are awesome. 

Both the Chinese and Western selections are simple and great."}
{"text":"Terrific little cafe on the corner of 21 Ave and 4th St. S.W.  First time there and it was charming.  I went there for the breakfast.  It's a small place with seating for about 18 people sitting at tables and an extra 6 at the counter.  

Service - run by a couple, she's out front and he's in the back.  Friendly and efficient, 

Food - very good, the hash browns were the fresh variety, pan-fried to where they had that \"crust\" that makes it and the center was soft.  The pancakes were great - again, cooked to perfection, moist inside with just the right amount of browning.  Their menu is on the walls all around, so you could see what was available, they also serve chinese food, though we didn't order any.  Sausage was ok, nothing special, but the ham was a cut above what you get elsewhere, again pan-fried.

Overall - great little cafe, it was crowded and most appeared to be regulars that helped themselves to coffee refills and even cleared off the table and took their plates to the counter.  I would definitely recommend and will go back."}
{"text":"Guys. Guys!!! Listen up!!

This place rocks. It is the best, best, best western style Chinese food I have ever get eaten in North America. Every dish was amazing. Even subtle. And not greasy. This is a simple place where you get the staple items, not a fancy-pants restaurant. They even have an extensive breakfast and western fast food (burgers and fries) menu.

Salt & pepper squid was not greasy, not too spicy or too salty; perfect. The noodle (#19) was really tasty, just the right ingredients and sauce, not oily. The sweet and sour chicken was absolutely spot on, very flavourful but not too sweet and treacly. And the beef with pepper sauce is highly recommended. The hot and sour soup was a bit bland, the only weak point. 

So check this place out! I've found my new go to place in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This is a classic diner where you can get a burger, chow mein, and an omelette all on the same menu. I had a cheese burger and it was just as delicious as the first time I came here 15 yrs ago.  It's a good little diner without the trendy diner line ups."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Western Coffee Shop.  I was there a lot back when I knew someone who lived in the area and there was a husband-wife team that ran the place.  It was comfortable, cozy and very busy back then.  There are new people there now and a reno'd front of resto, and they've expanded the menu to include western-chinese food.  I dropped in to have my favourite breakfast food and that is the denver omelette.  These guys knock it out of the park.  Best. Denver. Ever.  I attached a picture so show that they load this thing up with ham, onions and green peppers.  And those hash browns.  Wow.  
Service - very nice lady.  She is not intrusive but will get your order and food back to you at top speed.  Also makes sure you are happy with the food and tops up coffee regularly.
Parking - lot parking, you have to put your make, model and licence plate on the whiteboard as you enter.  Otherwise, you will have to buy a ticket from machine.  Plenty of street parking too.
Overall - great place, relaxed vibe.  Not like the trendy places that are packed in.  I've been back a few times now and the mix of patrons are from young artists to older people just having coffee and a catch-up.  Will be back to try their chinese food.  From the menu, it looks pretty good, esp. the deep-fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Ok so my fianc√© says let's go for Chinese at this little place I found that isn't fancy but delicious.
So I am game - we go.
WOW, all I can say is that it was by far some of the best Chinese food I have ever had!
We started with the panfried dumplings which were very tasty (although I requested sweet-and-sour sauce because I like that best for dipping)
I then had the ginger chicken based on his recommendation!
It is so amazing!
Sauce is scrumptious and the chicken is crispy on the outside and just down right good inside!
You could get it with rice or fried rice but I asked for the Singapore thick noodles, which they happily substituted for a $2 up-charge.
I can happily say - I will be back and I give this place 2 great big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both got the clubhouse with Wonton soup. The food was bland and worse then anything I could have made at home. No clue how this place has been in business for 20 years. There's tons of great pubs and restaurants on 4th street, I'd highly recommend taking your money to one of those places."}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast.  Fabulous service, prices, and very clean.

Can't wait to go back and try the Chinese food!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  It's a no-nonsense diner that offers a large assortment of Western and Chinese cuisine.  Breakfast? No problem, they offer a eggs, pancakes, sausages, bacon, toast, hash browns that is straightforward and home cooked.  They've got hamburgers and a regular assortment of Chinese food.  We have only tried the breakfast and it was cooked well.  Most places screw up my eggs (over medium), they either cook them too hard or over easy; not this place.

The dining area is clean, organized and you can see they take pride in their business.  If you decide to park in their parking lot you can put your name on their white board at the entrance so you won't get towed away.  They're licensed so have your beer/wine with your food!  Oh and they cater as well.

Great place!  We'll try the Chinese food next!"}
{"text":"I would have to disagree with raving reviews, sorry.

Food quality is uneven - some of it is pretty decent, but we also came over some chicken fingers with roughly chopped hard pieces of said chicken stuffed inside. Om-nom-crrack... Eww! Yuck!!

Drinks are also the typical minute maid kind of stuff from a penny-fridge. Oriental menu is good though, and the kitchen works really fast! That much for the positive side.

Now, even though the place is on the corner of a parking lot, you still have to pay for parking. And said lot is pretty small, with nearby streets packed with parked vehicles. May be ok for those who live nearby, but if you drive - it is a typical 4th street parking pain to deal with.

Service is as uneven as food - one lady was amazingly, fantastically helpful and polite! Two others... well, horrible. So nothing to consistently compliment here, unfortunately.

All in all, I would not get back to this place just for sake of it. But, it may serve its purpose when desperately needed, I guess."}
