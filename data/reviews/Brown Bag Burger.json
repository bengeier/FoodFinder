{"text":"We drive nearly 20 miles to get burgers here.  Both burgers and fries are awesome.  They let you do all sorts of customization to your burger for no extra charge, and the options are extensive and tasty.  I highly recommend their garlic mayo on anything you order ... I often get extra to eat with my fries.  Yeah, it's a burger joint in the mall, and their food.will probably clog the arteries of a rhino, but even rhinos need to live it up from time to time, and this is a burger you'll think of fondly, each time you take your cholesterol medicine."}
{"text":"Now THIS is a fine burger! Not too greasy and the bun is incredibly fresh. Lots of nice preconfigured options and good flexibility on building your own. Good hot dogs too for the kids. Fries are OK, and free peanuts abound. Restaurant is clean with charming painted wall murals."}
{"text":"Do you want a great fast food restaurant to stop in?   Well Brown Bag Burgers is a great fast food restaurant. The menu had many options to create a burger. You can get roasted red peppers, bacon, and jalape√±os. Another plus is that you can get up to 8 extra toppings for free with your burger.  There are also free peanuts in a can on a wall so help yourself!  The atmosphere in the restaurant  is fantastic. When the food is ready the workers will call out your name. The workers are very polite.   The restaurant itself is bright and colorful. There are little messages hidden around the restaurant that are quite amusing. In the back of the restaurant is a bulletin board where visitors can stick a pin from where they came from.   Overall this is a great place to stop for people who loves good food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a great burger hands down. Every time I've gone there it has been consistently good!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday, this is the first time I was disappointed. The burger was slightly cool, as were the fries. 5 guys is better hands down."}
{"text":"Good stuff, casual atmosphere, unique & delicious burgers- limited menu of 'pre-designed burgers', but you can build your own. Kinda like me Red Robin if it was fast food. We'll go back again, no problem"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday with husband and kids.  None of us liked it or finished our food.  Salty, salty, salty and greasy.  Bad flavor."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger which was OK.  The bun was the best part.  My buddy had a regular burger which was HUGE!  Fries were disappointing.  I like the atmosphere & decoration, but the tables were not clean, and the place was not busy at the time (after lunchtime) and there is really no excuse for that."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich rocks and the bread is the bomb.  The service and staff are awesome and go out of way to please the customers.  If by the mall it is a must have place to eat!"}
{"text":"Best burger place, hands down. I always get the original and devour the whole thing in less than 10 minutes. I am a petite female, by the way. They're delicious burgers! The decor is cool too. Lots of cocks and cows all around the establishment."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a month. The Mcdaddy is probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. Their fries are also very good and they always give you a ton of them. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great Burger,  Great Prices and Friendly Employees.  Love the Buns ,  In my opinion better than 5 Guys and oh how pains me to say this but it even better than IN N Out."}
{"text":"By far the best burger i've ever had in the Cleveland area. I hate comparing it to five guys but they're pretty similar..... EXCEPT, brown bag tastes a lot better, is a lot cheaper, has more toppings, offers truly free toppings (no $1.70 surcharge for bacon and cheese like at that other place) and has a much wider menu selection.  They offer beef, chicken, turkey, vegetarian and shrimp burgers as well as salads and hot dogs. They also offer soups, desserts, smoothies and frappes. There's bound to be something to enjoy here even if you don't like burgers! Anyway, the burgers are delicious and so are the fries... everything i've tried here has been delicious actually, and I guess that's the bottom line. If you're looking for a filling, affordable, delicious meal and aren't concerned with counting calories, this is your place!  The interior is really cute and farm themed... but the place is a tad bit small, if you come here on a friday or saturday evening you might have trouble finding somewhere to sit!  Just a tip.. the Jr. Burger is actually the same size as the regular burger, it just has a single patty instead of 2..... I usually go with that because it's cheaper and it's still filling!"}
{"text":"I agree with Vy.  Our family has been ordering from here regularly since they opened.  Portion sizes are down, prices are up, and poor customer service by management.  There are too many competitors around to bother with this place anymore even though we like the food.  We'll be trying Five Guys for the first time tonight."}
{"text":"I think a 5 star rating from this vegetarian says something about BBB.  I go with my wife, friend, and daughter a couple times a month for Sunday lunch.  The veggie burger done Bandito style is SO good.  As is the concoction I make of cheese and Frank's Red Hot sauce for my fries.  And I should mention that the Frank's flows from a giant endless pump!"}
{"text":"LOVE the bread! Has to be my favorite burger joint!  Chillie cheese fries are deliciouss!!!!"}
{"text":"Brown Bag is by far the best. They offer far more than 5 Guys and have better tasting food. I like that the very expansive topping choices are available. During busy lunch/dinner the wait is well worth it. If you order to-go the food holds up well on the way home, fries remain crispy, bum not soggy and wet, etc. Brown Bag rules."}
{"text":"How this place stays in business is a mystery. I ordered a mini meal for 7.00.... biggest waste of money ever.....should have gone to Wendy's or McDonalds  ...I had to wait a good ten minutes for my order....so thought it would be good ...BUT....to my dismay I got a soggy bun..and could \"almost find \" the paper thin dried out burger...I cut it in half and stacked the dry tough and tasteless halves...the fries came out greasy...ate a few ...because many underneath the pile were burned and dried out....the root beer was good! I understand why there was hardly anyone there....person who took my order acted like I was a bother...and sensed she wanted me to hurry it up ...I explained I had never been there before...she just sighed ....even though I was the only one in line I felt pressured to hurry up and decide ASAP."}
{"text":"If you like Five Guys, you'll love Brown Bag Burger! If you love Five Guys, you may need to sit down.  Brown Bag Burger uses a special secret seasoning to grill up burgers that are simply second-to-none. There isn't a burger I won't try; there isn't a trip to Cleveland where I don't drive out for this little slice of heaven. Accompanying the grilled deliciousness is a moist bun and a wide array of fresh toppings and sauces.  Well worth the drive from anywhere in Cleveland! Warning: I'd park far; you might appreciate the walk back to your car  ;-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading a few Yelp reviews. I must say that I really enjoyed my meal. The burger was about the size of a wendys burger with a giant bun. Let's say this could be a grown up Wendy's joint on steroids.  I got the Godfather.  It was soooo good. I love garlic so the garlic mayo was on point. Not too strong. It also had bruschetta, lettuce, cheese and onion straws. The combination was awesome.  The small fries were just enough.   I think that the patty could gave been a bit thicker for the price but overall I was pleased and will definitely visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and it continues to not disappoint. I tried the turkey burger for the first time and it was delicious. I made it a double and it was huge. The prices are reasonable and the food is great. Just wish they had a patio lol."}
{"text":"This place has a veggie burger that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The beef burgers are good too. The fries, both regular and sweet potato, are delicious. The fact they are right by my favorite nail salon helps. Plus Valpak usually has coupons for them."}
{"text":"When we are looking for our \"go to\" quick burger joint...there is no question that BBB is where we are heading.  Just across the street from the Great Northern mall in the strip shops sits this gem of a place.  Free peanuts, fries cooked in peanut oil, and an extensive burger topping list (most of it complimentary, even bacon!) make this the perfect spot to get a customized burger with all the trimmings.  My personal favorite is the double Mac Daddy with added bacon, but you can either pick from their already-conceived creations or make-your-own for the same price...brilliant!  BTW...unless you can eat a mountain of fries, get the small...other sizes just get plain ridiculous. ;-)"}
{"text":"The good 1. The place looks great 2. Burger was really good  3. Fresh cut fries was amazing  4. Good size menu 5. Custom burgers 6. Friendly service 7. Fast cook times 8. Milkshacks  The bad 1. Gets pretty busy 2. Can't choose how you want you burger cooked (raw, medium, well)  3. Not a lot of space for seating  4. Wish they had more locations   Overall a great place to grab a burger and fries we'll worth the cash. Will come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"There was a sign that said Fox 8 liked the place, for whatever that's worth.  I gave them 3 stars based on presentation.  The burger really looked good. If I went in blindfolded and ate, they would have only gotten two stars. Burger and fries cost about $11. I got the Brown Bag Burger.  I figured if that burger carried the restaurant name, it would be the best burger there.   The presentation was pretty good but I've had much better burgers at fast food joints- In n Out, Jack in the Box, Whataburger, Carl's Jr., even Wendy's.  I didn't read the description so the poor food choice was partly my fault.  The burger had caramelized onions- so many, it might as well have had nothing else.  That's all I tasted.  You should never use caramelized onions on a burger unless requested. Just like you shouldn't put anchovies on a pizza unless requested. That taste combined with rubbery meat patty.   The good part was that I ate all the meat halfway through my burger because the buns were way bigger than the meat, and I was left with half the burger, (minus the meat,) and two slices of tomato.  The taste of the burger greatly improved after the meat and onions were gone. You may wonder why I ate all the patty and onions if I didn't like them- cause I'm a fat guy, leave me alone.  I also once ate a whole serving of balut, crunchy beak and all.  Balut would have been an improvement for the Brown Bag Burger.  Wait! Brown Bag Balut Burger!  yes...  Now, they did a good job stealing 5 Guys fries technique, (peanut oil.) Also, my kid's chicken tenders were pretty good.  But, the ranch dressing sucked.  You should make that yourself.  Don't pour it from a 5 gallon Cisco container. If you did make it yourself and I'm wrong about the sauce being pre-made, then you lose another star."}
{"text":"It took me a while to go inside as its on the corner or a strip mall and pretty nondescript. DAMN, I was missing out! Great food, pretty cool concept w burgers that have a twist. Doritos on a burger? Winner. Havent had a bad experience yet. Stop in and give it a try"}
{"text":"I am not much of a fast food burger kind of gal so keep that in mind...  A+ for having bottles of malt vinegar on the tables!  Pick the burger you want, order it and sit down. Your name is called and voila you pick up your burger.  The MacDaddy sauce is good... A mayonnaisey concoction similar in taste and flavor to the one from the Golden Arches.  Thick sliced pickles... Loved them.  Overly buttered bun yikes.  Nothing standout about the patty... But again I am not much of a fast food girl (I will always seek out a grass fed burger for $10-$15).  See:  Flipside in Hudson.  Fries were skin-on and tasty.  I had the WORST BFS (bad food smell) on my clothes after eating here.  My God.  Either get the grub to go or plan to swing by the fragrance counter at Dillard's to spritz on some smell-goods if you need to go somewhere immediately after eating here!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I went after Christmas shopping on a Saturday afternoon. Clean & bright place. Hubby had the burger and I tried the shrimp burger. Both very good. The buns were great which, in my opinion, makes or breaks the sandwich. Also fresh cut fries!  This place is better than 5 Guys"}
{"text":"Nope, too dirty, the bathrooms were dirty, no one came out at he whole time we were there to bus the tables. Messy!  As far as the food--it was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Better than Five Guys. Good variety of toppings from bacon (no extra charge) to guacamole, and gourmet offerings as well (all shrimp burger patty, Italian bruschetta burger). The buns are fluffy and tasty, and the place is decorated pretty cute. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"i really didn't much like Brown Bag Burgers. someone one time told me how great it was years ago and i finally tried it today (had a Groupon).   Danielle had the MacDaddy burger w/ a turkey patty (basically the same toppings as a Big Mac. she said it tasted fine as long as she got a bite w/ everything. the patty wasn't seasoned.   Like Danielle's turkey burger, my beef patties were entirely tasteless. i got a burger w/ 2 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and A1 sauce. these were diced onions and there was way too much on the burger, though if i hadn't swept so much off there may have actually been something to taste. i couldn't even tell there was A1 sauce on the burger. it was just so bland.   on the other hand, the french fries were really very good.  i'm not sure i'll try BBB again. just didn't care for it too much at all."}
{"text":"I've finally had the chance to try out brown bag burger after meaning to for quite some time.   I decided to opt for their original burger because I don't really like anything fancy on my burger - but their other options look incredible too for people that enjoy a more unique experience. I really love that they have set options as well as a build your own menu. The set options make it easier to order than Five Guys which often overwhelms me with all their choices.   My burger was absolutely delicious. The bun was fresh, the meat was juicy, and it had just the right amount of toppings. With my burger I got chili cheese fries. These were just kind of \"meh\" and I probably won't get them again. The chili tastes like it was straight from a can.   On the other hand, my friend got the Bandito with sweet potato fries and loved it! I kept stealing his fries because they were SO good. They were crispy and came with this amazing marshmallow-y cinnamon dip that was incredible. I would definitely recommend those!  All in all, I would return here for a burger if I were in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best burger anywhere !  It's number #1 burger in Cleveland and I'm not sure how ?! The brand has serious potential but they need some help with seasonings on the burger . A better bun and the counter people could be more inviting !"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great burgers and fries. I try to eat here every time I come to the west side around Great Northern. Worth the try. Worth the trip. Delicious!"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST PLACES!!!  My husband and I tried this spot for the first time and we will be going back for sure. The atmosphere is unique and the food is A+."}
{"text":"The Wife and I are not burger people.  Its not that we don't enjoy burgers, we do, but we rarely go to a place specifically to get burgers.  That being said, this place is close to our church that we go to on Sundays and I was curious about the good reviews.  We came for the first time about 1 month ago.  Great toppings, very interesting mix of burgers and sandwiches.  Fries were fresh and tasty.  There was a problem w/ our order but they fixed it without complaint.  My wife got a shrimp burger and LOVED it.    Loved it so much that we came back last weekend.  Once again, there was an issue w/ our burger orders, but we didn't have the heart to go ask to get it changed so we just ate it.  I left a comment in the comment card box re: the order mix ups and to my surprise the manager wrote me a personal email apologizing for the mix up and offering a gift certificate for my next visit.  Turns out there was an error on the menu board which was why there was confusion about our shrimp burger.  In any case, we have decided that we like this burger place best and plan to visit it on a fairly regular basis when we are hankering for something different than the typical ethnic foods that we usually get."}
{"text":"2/2 with the veggie burger. Plenty of toppings to choose from but I went with one of their menu choices, the Veggie Macdaddy!  Their buns are fresh, sauces delicious albeit smothering, and staff is extremely friendly. Great and clean restaurant; perfect food for a quick bite inside or to-go."}
{"text":"There are way more menu options here compared to 5 Guys and there are other things on the menu besides burgers. There are many different toppings to choose from, but with more options you lose some quality. The hand cut fries are pretty much the same as 5 Guys but you can get toppings on them. The burgers are bigger but I didn't think they were as juicy or we'll seasoned compared to 5 Guys.   Prices are not bad but if your looking to smash expect to pay around $15 for a meal. Overall, I would say Brown Bag Burgers might have a small edge because of the variety."}
{"text":"Love the customizable burger, the fresh fries with pico, the free peanuts, and the quirky decor but the best attribute is by far the friendly servers!  They are top notch!  Say hi to our Dontrell!"}
{"text":"I love this place, my favourite is their bueno burger! WAY better than Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Triple B has come thru again w/ the best burger I've had there yet. They've never disappointed is at least 20 visits over the years.  I got the chicken patty again. You know why they don't offer double chicken.. b/c it would be way too big!  Their breast pieces are monster thick, but cooked perfectly w/ juicy tenderness.  W/ toppings I could barely pick it up.  Totally beats out 5 Guys everyday.      Kids grilled cheese is a thing of beauty too.. picture perfect!  5 guys doesn't have a real G.C. They have to flip bun inside out & then smash it flat to keep it together.  Plus they put out coupons regularly."}
{"text":"Why anyone likes 5 Guys I do not know! Brown Bag Burger is where it is at! I love to get the turkey burger with mushrooms, onions and swiss cheese. So delicious. I tell all my friends about this place. When you really want a good burger, this is where to go! Their fries are so good, too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a double and got a single patty, but the customer service is awesome here and they made up for it. Definitely coming back, burgers were delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok, I can't help but crave the BANDITO burger here! I ordered a junior burger (one patty) and it comes with a super juicy patty, guac under the bun, little fried onion straws, and pico de gallo and other delicious flavors. I was told to come here by my friend. This place is delicious enough to deserve it's own post on the 100 days of cleveland blog: http://juliaincleveland.tumblr.com/post/9258810423/day-71-100-the-bandito-burger-this-is-my#notes"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. Although, i got all the way home and noticed the cheese was missing for the fries, i called just to aware them not even wanting anything in return they offered to mail me coupons or a free meal. Everyone there was polite and worked super fast! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Voted clevelands #1 burger for a reason! I've been here a couple of times and now finally getting around to a review.  The inside is small, maybe 10 tables, some only 2 stool tables, definitely more of a take out place. It's a typical burger joint with a yummy twist.   The burgers are huge, definitely get your money's worth.  The Godfather burger is my all time favorite with the Bandito being a very close second. The burgers are as fresh as can be, the buns nice and soft (teehee).Fresh cut fries topped with chili and cheese.   The kids menu is great also, corn dogs, burgers, fries Mac and cheese all options the kids will love.   It's a great quick meal idea, affordable, close by if you live near west lake and surrounding, it's located in the mall parking lot on the corner by Macy's because I had a lil tough time finding it from mapquest.   Happy eating!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty fast food, and a crazy hand dryer!  THE UP-SIDE:  For a fast-food sorta deal, this place is pretty darn tasty.  I usually go with the Turkey Burger and am never disappointed.  You can also choose from a beef, veggie or portabello type burger.  The toppings are many, and are all up to you.  And then there's the fries; quite tasty in their own right, and served in big portions.  One other up-side...  The bathroom hand dryer; it's like a jet engine.  Scared the heck outta me the first time I used it.  Funny stuff.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  This place goes for that down-homesy-folksy feel with cutesy \"rude\" sayings on the walls.  They're supposed to be funny, but I find them a little aggravating.  They remind me of something somebody's grandparents would find \"daring\" and \"naughty.\"  (Bo-ring)  None the less, the quality of the food surpasses the silly signs.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here when you want fast-food, but are aching for something a little better than the norm.  It's good stuff."}
{"text":"'Tis an okay joint. Burgers are good. Greasy but good. Toppings are nice. Its like the unnecessary mercedes compared to 5 guys, efficient 1980 beemer.   There is a very good burger with avocado on it. And the greasy fries with vinegar is a great munchies solution."}
{"text":"I read so many great reviews about this place and we were so excited to try it out but left wondering if we were missing something.  I built my own burger and my husband got a specialty burger and neither were particularly bad but they weren't amazing either like we thought they'd be after all the glowing reviews.  I think Five Guys and Smash Burger are better.  In addition to the food being average the restaurant just felt dirty and like it needed a good scrub down."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm yum! Great and fresh burgers, amazing price, nice ambiance, funny posters, free peanuts while waiting for the burger. love love love ! Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our dinner at Brown Bag Burgers. My wife had the original and I had The Godfather and both were awesome."}
{"text":"To start off, I came here w/a kindergartener, preschooler, toddler and infant. The bathroom is severely uncomfortable to use and dirty. After the quality of food&kitchen cleanliness, That's the most important aspect of a restaurant to me. I was shocked from how dirty and dilapidated it is. Bathroom Renovation possibly? 2ndly, the food was great. I would only rethink the amount of oils used to cook the foods. Very very greasy. Once a year is okay, but beyond that... it's too slimy to eat. The taste was great! But not an every day food."}
{"text":"Better menu than that \"Five ... \" place - more options, more toppings.  They also don't seem as greasy as that other place.  Better buns - a little bigger, so a little easier to eat.  And they're pretzel buns, so a better flavor.  Good fries.   About the same price.  Worth the visit for something just a little different."}
{"text":"My brother took me here for lunch recently. The place has been here for a couple years, I guess taking over an old bagel storefront near Great Northern Mall, but it's never really been on my radar.  I'm glad he introduced me to it.  There's no need to be verbose: This place has great greasy burgers if that's what you're in the mood for. Good stuff. The burgers are good in that \"Swenson's\" kinda way, but more refined. Fresh fries. Generally more food than an adult male can eat. Good value for money."}
{"text":"This place is really great, its expensive for a family of 4, $40.00 for all of us, little on the high side, but well worth it, only order one large it fed us all, and they are awesome fries. Custom burgers are a good way to go. Burgers are truly good."}
{"text":"This is a must-stop every time I'm in North Olmsted.  Quality ingredients (bun and meat both taste extremely fresh, good cheese and other toppings) come together to make a great burger and the fries are fantastic."}
{"text":"This was a random stop which happened to be close to the hotel I was staying. Wonderful food, quirky atmosphere and you definitely get your money's worth. I tried the Godfather, which was amazing. I'm not a big mayo person, but I loved the garlic mayo. My daughter tried the special mushroom Swiss burger which was also fantastic. Please take note, unless you are SUPER hungry or have to feed a bus full of hungry teenage athletes, get a small size fries."}
{"text":"The Burger's here are REALLY good.  My only critique would be the awkward workers.   Not that they're bad, just very weirdly quiet and seemed like when we came in they didn't expect anyone to come in and were just....awkward.  Decor is simple and the walls have random messages on them that are kind of funny to read while you wait.   All in all, if you want a burger that is cheap and WAY better than a fast-food burger. Go here!"}
{"text":"I have given Brown Bag Burger several tries but always leave thinking I was right, it just is not that good. The closest comparison is Five Guys which I so wanted to think was not that good. Five guys is a national chain which originated in Washington, DC. Nothing good ever came from Washington, DC but Social Security and Medicare to my way of thinking with no intent to provoke Conservatives.   The actual burger at Brown Bag is oddly spiced with too much salt and lacks the beefiness of the burger at Five Guys. Both will cost you ten bucks for a burger, fries and soda. Brown Bag at least does not have stacks of potatoes cluttering up the place, or the walls full of self congratulatory reviews, or a sign proclaiming your french fries' hometown. Brown Bag does have a high partition dividing the open kitchen from the sitting area. Thus the room appears small and customers crowd around the counter waiting for their order to be called rather than sitting at a table waiting for it to be delivered. While there are many behind the counter the wait time is particularly long. Not a good design or system.   In the past I have seen Brown Bag nominated as best burger on some list and go once again for enlightenment. I made my last trip there this past Saturday. I was enlightened. It is not on my list of best burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers to me could of been just alittle better tasted kind of bland and had there strawberry lemonade it was okay but dosent top o'chalies lemonade."}
{"text":"OMFG! OMFG!  Me loves this place!  Me never had burger so good and chub producing!  Holy crap Batman, me just creamed my high water pants after first bite of yummy beef disc sandwiched between soft buns that remind me of newborn baby bottoms if they were made of refined potato flour!  Me likes the decor, me likes the service, but most of all, me LOVES the burgers!!!  Which one?  All of them mofo!!!!  Me never had burgers so good!  Go to hell Mickey D's, suck it BK, shove it up your you know what Red Robin, sit and spin White Castle, eat poop and die Steak N Shake, there be no other burger place for me!  Me wishes me could speak normal English, but me made speechless by tastiness!!! Yummmmm, me never been so happy since me honeymoon night.  That is, until me found out me bride was grandma playing sick joke on me.  Now me sad and traumatized thinking about it.  Me eat burger to make me forget the special kisses.  Me say bye now.  Bye bye."}
{"text":"As I walked in for the first time the girl at the counter was courteous and patient enough to explain the process of ordering a custom burger.  When I bit into my burger it was well seasoned and juicy.  It was an awesome burger.  It helped to chow down on some peanuts as I was waiting.  Great burger joint!"}
{"text":"This place can't get more awesome. Best burgers ever. Smashes 5 Guys beyond belief."}
{"text":"We called at 140 to have a burger and fries for pick up. They said 5-6 minutes so I asked if we could wait for it be ready at 2pm since we wouldn't be there in 5 minutes. The guy said i could do that online but i said i already placed the order and just wanted it ready  later so its not soggy then he said hold on and had to get the manager. The manager said to call back when I want it ready instead if just waiting 15 minutes to make it."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. A bunch of young adults who need maturing. Even the manager was unpleasant after we asked if we could get something other than the smoothie we ordered. The smoothie was as artificial as they get.   With a combination or the horrible staff and food I would give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time. The beef was course ground, the toppings were fresh and good. All in all it was a decent burger but not one I would go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a weekend afternoon to check this place out. Hostess was pleasant. Place was clean with some humorous country d√©cor. It's in a plaza across from Macy's FYI.   -Double patty MacDaddy $7.29 - Had a bite of this and it's just like the chain version. Not really impressed with it. Also, the burger patties look small on top of the big soft buns. -Godfather $5.79 - Pretty tasty burger. The garlic mayo, bruschetta topping, and crispy onion straws really worked well on this. I would get it again.  -Medium fry $3.79 - Fresh cut and big enough for two people to share. However, we had to put them in the oven when we got home because they weren't cooked long enough (edible, but a little too pale and limp to be enjoyable).  -Side of sauce .79¬¢ - But more than plenty to dip your fries into.   I would compare this place to Five Guys, but not as greasy and perhaps better since they offer a lot more toppings. While my first visit was not a home-run, I would still definitely hit this place back up again (the price is right, the godfather was tasty, and the fries were good after cooking longer)."}
{"text":"Best burger around! I heard great things about this place and was very impressed. The burgers have a great flavor to them and they have a great selection of toppings. This burger was definitely less greasy than their competitors as well. Excellent burgers!"}
{"text":"The burger was awesome. There were three of us and we enjoyed our food. I had the bandito burger foo foo fries, fantastic! Would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"The Burger's here are amazing!!  When ever I visit Ohio, I have to stop at Brown Bag.  It is only of the best burgers I have ever had anywhere.  Poor five guys across the road must be suffering.  This simply cannot be topped.  I'd call it a casual lunch burger place that never disappoints.   The delicious fries are cooked in peanut oil and taste almost sweet sometimes from the funnel sticks.   The Bandito with onion straws and MacDaddy are a favorite.  Free peanuts to munch while you wait.  Once a year in March out comes the Dubliner, a burger stacked with fries and coleslaw... It's sweet, it's salty, it's crunchy and blows me away every time.   I have noticed the burger sizes change but my enjoyment as remained and  I will be a longtime customer as long as things do not drastically change."}
{"text":"The buns! The burger buns that is. I love Brown bag, I don't know what it is that makes it different that Five Guys but man I love it. Maybe it's the bun or the mayo, but it's a great burger.   I think that there is something to write home about (or on Yelp about) lol. I mean it's not Swensons, but hey, it's in a great location, decent prices, and free peanuts.   Give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"In terms of a fast food burger joint, this gets 4 stars. It's obviously much better than a mcdonalds or Burger King, but doesn't quite compete with higher-end burger joints. So I am basing my 4 star review comparing these burgers to other fast good chains. I got the macdaddy double burger, as I always do here. It's the refined version of a Big Mac. While you wait for them to make your burger (not very long, think Panera waiting time) you can chomp on some peanuts. Solid fast food joint (no drive thru), solid burger."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken burger for the first time. Ordered mine with lettuce, garlic mayo and onion straws.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a chicken breast. I think that I have a new favorite sandwich. I just love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and excellent fries! Better than Five Guys, better than Smashburger, WAY better than Fatburger. If there's a better pure burger joint, I have yet to find it."}
{"text":"One fantastic Yelp find I didn't even know we were looking for. I thought it would be off the beaten path, but it ended up being in a mall... a slight surprise for this girl, but I went with it.   The burgers were really good! A small one'll do ya OK... I believe they refer to it as a \"junior.\" I went for the shrimp burger (no beef!) and it was really good. The fries were also decent and large enough to split for sure. Apparently there are only two locations at the moment, but I could easily see this place having dreams of franchising.   The staff was friendly and the decor was a bit kitschy but it had some genuine Midwest charm. I dug it."}
{"text":"Brown Bag never disappoints!  I love the make your own burgers.  I always want to mix it up but end up getting the same thing.  And the fries are the best.  Nothing beats fresh cut fries loaded with malt vinegar and hot sauce.  My kids love it too!  We are regulars..."}
{"text":"They make a good burger and I like the casual atmosphere. The have a trowel of peanuts to snack on while you wait for your order which I think is pretty cool (but being a germ-o-phobe, I do not partake). I didn't really enjoy the fries and found them to be really soggy, but we did order to go which may have been why they did not hold up. I can't say this was one of the best burgers I ever had, but I wouldn't be opposed to visiting again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this burger. They bake their buns fresh daily (get your mind out of the gutter). Their buns are very unique. They are like a hybrid between a croissant and a potato bun. My only beef (pun intended) is that the bun was a little on the cold side. It would've been nice to have my bun a little toasted (this is getting dirty ..... [why does he keep using parenthesis?...I hope he doesn't so that for the whole review.])  So the burger itself was very tasty. I actually asked for it to be cooked medium rare but they told me they can only make it well done (which I loathe). Nothing worse than a burned up burger! It's a mortal sin to me. But surprisingly, it wasn't that bad for a well done burger. Still juicy. Still had flavor.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I could not have it medium rare, and the bun should've been toasted.. But I would definitely come back if I was in town.. No question."}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through on a road trip and stopped here. We really enjoyed the burgers. We both created our owns and enjoyed all of the options they had. I loved their homemade buns and also how nicely their sandwiches stayed together and didn't fall a part. The fries were also good but needed to be cooked a little longer. We enjoyed our visit and would go back again if we were in the area. We liked it better then five guys."}
{"text":"Was just treated rude because a customer I was not with complained about the wet floor"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. I go every time go to Cleveland. The veggie burger is phenomenal, one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of BBB for years now, and the food here is truly excellent!  The people that own and work at this place should be very proud of what they have.  The burgers here are very very good.  I'd say one of the top 3 burger joints in NE Ohio, but not quite as good as 'B-Spot'... but close.  'The Foo-Foo fries' are excellent as well, but I wish they put more ground beef on there.  If you like seafood, you have to try their shrimp burger.  It is outstanding!  Absolutely mouth watering phenomenal, with succulent shrimp, melted cheddar cheese, mildly spicy sauce, and other veggie fixin's on a perfect round bun!  Honestly, who needs the large national chains that are usually overpriced and average, when you have places like Brown Bag Burger around!  UPDATE 9/29/12: I had to take a star off, because I went there yesterday, and their shrimp burger did not have any cheese on it, and their Foo-Foo fries were extremely salty.  And I do mean EXTREMELY!  I couldn't eat them!  I hope this place isn't 'slipping'."}
{"text":"First few times I had brown bag it was 5 star amazing. But now the past 3 times I've gone I've gotten hard bits in my burger and much smaller burger size. I don't know about you, but when I get hard bits in my meat It really makes me not want to eat it again. The toppings and fries are delicious though! You may get a bit less fries then you used too but it's still plenty to keep you stuffed and they taste just like my moms homemade (can't get them much since she lives in Michigan so they fix my craving). Next time I go I might see if I can just get a sandwich with no meat but toppings (the roasted red peppers are so good). If they would use better meat I'd have given them 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"With Brown Bag around I really have no reason to go to Five Guys or the like.  I put this place on the same level as B-Spot as the best Burger places in Cleveland.  I have tried everything here at least once, the Turkey burger is definitely the best, I really have never had a better Turkey burger anywhere.  Their standard beef burgers are very good too, and are always seasoned perfectly.  The portions are huge, I never leave hungry and for the price you cant beat it.  The service here is always good, everyone behind the counter has been nice and polite.   If you are in North Olmsted and want a cheap lunch, Brown Bag Burger is the place to go."}
{"text":"Brown Bag Burger is our favorite go-to burger restaurant when we want fast food that actually tastes delicious and costs the same (or less) than the much more disgusting in fast food varieties. I have not gone back to Five Guys ONCE since trying this place a few years back.   I always get the smaller-sized burger - the regular is really big! Now, I usually get the vegetarian burger option, and let me tell you, it is delicious...especially Bandito style. Mmm! There are a lot of toppings to choose from (all free!) with much more variety than the aforementioned burger place, the buns are good, the burgers are juicy but not greasy, and the fries are really. The smaller size fry is still really big, so unless you plan on sharing, I would go for the kids' size."}
{"text":"Always delicious! The mushroom bisque soup with a turkey burger is my favorite. My only complaint is that the last time I got the chicken, it was grilled tenders instead of a breast.  Seemed like a downgrade from the way they used to serve it. Other then that they are a terrific place and I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I don't know. Maybe it was the hype of the place but I was expecting a fantastic burger. The fries was okay and the burger (the godfather) was tasty but not the best I ever had. Maybe I'll try experimenting with my burger and adding other toppings to it. I do have to give them this, the place was clean for having free peanuts."}
{"text":"Sorry B Spot, I have a new  fave turkey burger. Amazing flavor and not dry.  Definite recommend from me!"}
{"text":"Upon entering brown bag burger in North Olmsted, a quick glance to the right reveals the store mascot, a full-size artificial cow named brown bag Betty who is up on a pedestal and fully dressed for the occasion. OK, The weirdness has just begun, because all over the store are artwork and plaques reinforcing the idea of folksy and funny kitsch.  My choice for dinner was a Godfather burger featuring bruschetta, garlic mayo and two patties with cheese. No only was the burger perfectly cooked, but what was really impressive was the way the sandwich was at once wonderfully juicy but also held together without disintegrating because of the high quality bun that was used.  Fresh-cut french fries anyone? These were on par with if not better than five guys, and a medium order was more than enough for the three people in my party.  Milkshakes are generously large but not overpriced, and featured an impressive array of flavors. My son tried a peanut butter and he said it was among the best peanut butter flavored products he'd ever eaten.  The place was scrupulously clean, the staff was unfailingly polite, and the bathrooms are their own minor miracle of goofiness. I won't spoil that for you."}
{"text":"The review below is what I wrote about my first visit to Five Guys. Why did I copy pasta it here? Because to my tastebuds Five Guys and BBB are virtually the same place.  I didn't have to change a word.  ____________________________________  I'm afraid my voice joins those who thought it was going to be something special. I was very disappointed--and not because the food was bad as it most absolutely wasn't. It was a perfectly good burger...BUT--and here's the point, NOT good enough to make me go back. Really, I can name a 1/2 dozen places that do burgers better, bud.   Sometimes, my friends, the hype is just hype."}
{"text":"I dare you to find better burgers, hot dogs and fries anywhere else in the Cleveland area!!!!  I eat there every Saturday night!  I order: Turkey Burger Lettuce Tomato Poco de Gallo Pepper Jack cheese Burgandt Mushrooms Roasted Red Pepper Garlic Mayo  Regular Fries with Malt Vinegar and a side of Garlic Mayo for fry dipping!!  It's the moistest, tastiest, messing meal around.   I encourage you to copy my order above then tell me if that's not the best turkey burger you've ever had at a resturant!"}
{"text":"It was good, but nothing to write home about. Went there for lunch with a coworker. I got a veggie burger (topped with onion straw, pepper jack cheese and guacamole) and fries. Greasy, the way I think it should be."}
{"text":"Why this place gets such good reviews I am not sure. I can theorize though. Brown Bag Burger is a Five Guys copy. Almost everything they do is a copy of five guys. They have a larger menu and their own theme but its the same... theme, feel, food, people, fun idea. Unfortunately, Brown Bag Burgers seem so greasy and totally not fresh. I live in North Olmsted and drive by  Brown Bags on a daily basis. After a while I realized that the people I was looking at were the same people. It is rare that I realize Im looking at the same people sitting at the tables and the same time of day. When a restaurant has the same clients day in and day out it says something. You always want to bring in new customers. Brown Bag just does not seem fresh. I can't keep it in my system. While Five Guys is greasy I can keep in my system and it seems fresh. Also Brown Bag has one thing we short people don't like. A high counter to order at. If all you see is my head bobbing up and down by the counter. The counter is too high."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. Soft and delicious! And the fries were good too. Whenever I'm back in Ohio I will definitely drop back in."}
{"text":"For the money and groupon deals, you can't beat his place. The sandwiches are good and for $6-7 you can get an awesome burger or sandwich with 8 toppings...8...that's nuts! It's quick too which is nice and you get free peanuts to eat too. I love he map in the back of he push pins where everyone who has visited is from."}
{"text":"Wow this place has taken a huge nose dive. My husband, son, and I went here for dinner tonight. We have been a fan of Brown Bag for years and was really looking forward to dining here. When we arrived, the peanuts were almost gone. The heat was on so low, I couldn't feel my fingers. Our burgers which used to be huge are now disappointingly small. You couldn't even see the burger through the bun. We ordered the new sweet potato fries and they were awful. Again, really small - I counted 18 fries. 18 fries for $2.29. When I asked the manager about this, he dismissed me and said, \"they are prepackaged this way\" and \"nothing we can do\". So much for fresh food - prepackaged??    We will not be returning again. What a shame."}
{"text":"On my quest to try all the great burgers of Cleveland, I stopped at Brown Bag Burger today after buying some new clothes down the block at K&G.  I ordered The Original, fries, and fruit punch.  The fresh-cut fries were really good with vinegar sprinkled on them.  The burger was delicious!  It had cheese, tomato, lettuc, onions, and two 1/2 lb patties.  Yum!  It's not the best burger in Cleveland, but it was very good.  I'm really interested in trying some of the other sandwiches on the menu like the veggie burger and the shrimp burger.  I saw a bucket of peanuts, but I didn't eat any.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"After all the hype I've heard, this was a bit disappointing.  I got the Brown Bag Original and the Foo Foo Fries.  Burger was a single, which basically disappeared under the large (and dry) bun. I like onions, but they put I think the whole onion on the burger and it took all the other flavors away. If you want to get a full experience you likely need at least a double.  The fries were definitely the best part; chili, cheese, and jalapenos. Good balance.  Was about $10 (I got a water).  I'm not sure if maybe because I was the first one in the door at 11 it was a bit off, but this place is commonly compared to Five Guys, and Five Guys has a vastly superior burger."}
{"text":"Tons of options on the menu here so I ordered five different burgers to take home. I tried a bite of each one and wasn't impressed. They weren't bad, just not impressive. In my personal opinion it is a distant second to the quality I get at Five Guys. Fries are a miss altogether. I got home to find the double burger I ordered had one patty further adding to an overall negative experience.   I'd pick this place over McDonald's or BK as it is roughly the same price. Just be prepared not to be blown away by their burgers."}
{"text":"I only have the chance to dine at Brown Bag Burger when I'm dropping off or picking up someone from the airport and, considering how good this place is, those occasions don't occur nearly enough.  I always get the MacDaddy burger and an order of the FooFoo Fries when I come here. The burger is two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, pickles, special sauce, and then I add bacon and tomato. The FooFoos are delicious fries smothered in nacho cheese, chili and jalapeno peppers.  It's one of the most satisfying and, probably, least healthy meals in Northeast Ohio, and I only wish I could enjoy it more often. Alas..."}
{"text":"What is going on at this place?  Stopped in with my boyfriend over the weekend, and left feeling pretty disappointed. A lot of things seem to have changed since the last time I visited a year or so ago, and not for the better.   The food seems like it's from a completely different restaurant! Everything has suffered, in both quantity and quality.   Other than the bread (which is still delicious), the food was all wrong. For starters: the actual burger patties and toppings seem about 50%-70% smaller than they used to be. The garlic aioli on the Godfather tastes way different than it used to... now it tastes artificial, like Lipton soup mix instead of like fresh garlic. Also, we ordered one medium fries, and it was smaller than the small size we used to order to share between two people... and the fries were completely different.   The obnoxious teenage employees are as awful as ever - the difference is, I never cared about the terrible service when we used to enjoy the food.   Of course the prices have probably gone up as well, although I can't remember what they used to be. This time around, two (gross) burgers, one order of fries, and two small fountain drinks came out to be about $23.   Lastly, small change: they changed from Coke to Pepsi for fountain soda.   Meh..."}
{"text":"Brown bag is a little gem and it is the cutest in the winter with all the lights and decorations! Great burgers and fries they have a great selection of pops and teas there too (: only complaint is they don't have onion rings! Everything can be completely customized and if you're not in the mood for a burger get the grilled cheese mm!"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good. They are no Swensons but they are good. So good in fact I though I saw some kind of like animal hair in the burger. I don't believe it to be a human hair because it was more firm. I still ate it because of the burger's taste. I figure, well the cow that I am eating was covered in fur at one point and it tastes so good so forget it, why complain. Who am I? The fries are delicious and cooked in peanut oil."}
{"text":"We just can't stop coming here! If you think the beef burgers are great and you haven't tried the shrimp burger, you're definitely missing out!  Now as far as the smoothies go, they are pretty good, but there is only one size for $3 and it is about enough for a children's drink...  Even still, I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in years. Far superior to Five Geeks or Red Robber. Bun was phenomenal. Price was way better than Red Rubber too. I even ordered a veggie burger as well, since I used to be a vegetarian and feel I need to taste both options. That one was also pretty good( somewhere in between a house made Winking Lizard veggie and a Morningstar Farms veggie). My only gripe was the detectable grains of rice. Winking Lizard's are less grainy. But both Brown Bag burgers would easily make me a return customer. Ok, second gripe, the fries. Limp and boring( like Mike Polk's comedy). I miss old school McDonald's flash frozen and flash fried strands of starch. But ever since asshole Morgan Spurlock made the golden arches public enemy number one, fries everywhere have become these \"healthier\" skin on  shadows of their former selves. I have to say, it's hard to find a good french fry anymore. But again, the patties here, tops in the game."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of burgers and go out of my way to try them at new places.  At this price point, BBB is the best burger.  Compared to: Five Guys -- the bun is much fresher, moister, and tastier.  the toppings far more plentiful.  if you even like mushrooms a little, you MUST try the burgundy mushrooms.  the fact that the toppings are included is a beautiful thing.  Red Robin -- burgers are a little smaller at BBB, but you're paying less.  again I think BBB bun wins out while the flavor of the meat is similar.  B-spot - larger than B-spot burgers, and back to the value, the price is excellent.  I'm not crazy about BBB' fries.  I don't like the slightly limp, natural with skin variety of fries.  Others may.  The choices for the kids are better than average.  My kids LOVE corn dogs and this is one of very few places that has them on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! I think they make the best burgers for the price!!!! Its not too expensive there, and the place is nice as well. Definitely beats 5guys, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Overall great. Burger was very hot  fries were a bit over cooked. Atmosphere was nice, music okay. Service fast on Mothers Day....Family enjoyed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and the bandito and fries has yet to disappoint! Family friendly, delicious food, fun atmosphere, reasonably priced. The local fish sandwich (deal during lent) was very good as well! Will definitely frequent this place."}

{"text":"I will eat at BBB over B-Spot any day of the week and twice on Sunday. That's not necessarily a knock on B-Spot as much as it is a credit to Brown Bag Burger. If you want a gourmet burger prepared exactly the way you want it for an affordable price, then BBB is your place."}
{"text":"It's a slightly better than five guys experience.  The fries are similar except you can get a side of cheese which is excellent. The garlic mayo is awesome as well. Highly enjoyed it."}
