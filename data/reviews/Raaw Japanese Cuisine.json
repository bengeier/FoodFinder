{"text":"Let me preface by saying that after ordering food for delivery, I was going to give Raaw a better rating but that went out the window after dining in for lunch.  Upon entering the dark, sparse-looking restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the smell of the musty cloth used to clean the tables. Not only did the place smell bad but the tables were visibly dirty.  Next, a long black hair on one of the napkins. Appetizing, right? I'm assuming that because the place is so dark, the servers can't see what they're doing. Reassuring in a restaurant that deals with raw fish.  One of my dining counterparts received cold chicken teriyaki, while another person's was warm. And worst of all, we received ice cold, PRE-MADE sushi. Am I at a mall sushi stand? Good sushi is room temperature, obviously.  To add insult to injury (almost literally), all of the ceramic dishes had not one, but several large chips in them. Plus the miso soup was served in a cheap plastic container making the soup taste like, you guessed it, cheap plastic.  Me thinks not, indeed."}
{"text":"Overpriced with mediocre to poor sushi offerings. I live nearby and really wanted this place to be my go-to sushi spot. Unfortunately, after ordering several times, I can't bring myself to waste any more money here. Rice is often undercooked to the point that it's crunchy. \"Specialty\" rolls I tried were so doused in mayo that I had to throw them out. It was like eating a seafood-mayonaisse stew. Regular salmon maki rolls are the tiniest I've ever seen. I honestly don't know how this place stays in business... good location and branding I guess."}
{"text":"We come here a lot.  Happy to see it is a lot busier now and some nights we come in to a full restaurant.  The owner is really nice and accomodating and helps make great food recommendations.  They have good sashimi and kani salad.  I've been noticing in recent visits that our dishes are served in chipped dishes, e.g. salad bowls, soup bowls.  That is not acceptable.  Service is usually very good.  Our last visit, there was a girl serving us who didn't quite fit the typical server profile we are used to at Raaw - this girl was kind of rough around the edges and wiped her nose with her hand in between cleaning tables & serving customers.  Again not acceptable.  Better training needed?  Maybe she was just a back up person.  I'm hopeful things will improve.  We will return."}
{"text":"I love sushi and this is definitely one of my favorite places! I am so happy that there's one place in Liberty I can go to that never disappoints.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious. You have to try the banzai roll, it doesn't have rice - eel, salmon, tuna, avocado and imitation crab, with some tempura bits wrapped around with cucumber and seaweed, all drizzled in their house honey wasabi sauce... Yumm! It's my go-to roll when I go with friends who haven't been to Raaw.  The ceviches are also delicious, I love the white tuna with fresh seeweed (forgot what it's called), very unique, and I can drink the sauce like a cold soup!  My hubby doesn't eat fish so he takes the veggie blast - sweet potato tempura with avocado on top, simple but amazing!  Every time I come, I try something new and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the place. Unfortunately the fish didn't taste very fresh, and they drench every roll in wasabi mayo - it's overpowering and tastes awful to me (if you like wasabi mayo though, you'll love this place). Not for me."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best sushi in King West. Great for delivery. If you are a vegetarian this is the place for you. Veggie blast is delicious. Staff is friendly and efficient.  Eat in restaurant is not like the average sushi place. Great decor, clean and you want to be there. But of course its usually empty because sushi is a hardcore order-in choice. Either way you are going to love it!"}
{"text":"dirty tables.  8 maki - $9 - fish is ik, rice is fine  sunomono salad - $9 - some tiny pieces of shrimp and ... on a big hill of noodles  ( noodles in salad ?!? )   servants in grey ti-shorts - like on garage sale .  no orange with melon on wooden toothpick - ?!  expencive and unpleasant place in Very Nice location !!  compare to  12-22 places what I have been - + many Countries what I visited  = - do not worth to spend time and money"}
{"text":"I eat sushi a lot, but I typically stick to very simple choices as I'm allergic to shellfish.  I asked our waitress what Kani was and told her I was allergic to shellfish.  She told me it was whitefish so I was fine.    When the plates were delivered to the table of course two of them contained crab.  We reminded the waitress that I was allergic to shellfish and she shrugged her shoulders.  Long story short, we were asked to pay for the sushi and told we could 'take home for a friend' since it was already made.  The way that waitress handled the situation was absolutely absurd.  I get there was a miscommunication and I get that I should have known what Kani was, but I also get that she could have handled it way differently.  The sushi was ok - nothing that would bring me back to this restaurant - below average.  I would not recommend this place - spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've had in Toronto. I go twice a week and it's always fresh and delicious! I eat sushimi every time and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch - ingredients are extra-fresh and meal is tasty. They give \"botomless\" tea also - waitress fills your cup with tea every 5-10 minutes. And miso is great."}
{"text":"I eat here every week, they have ritual and I work nearby. I also eat in occasionally. Super friendly servers. Great lunch specials. I love their veggie blast, so delicious for people who don't like raw fish like me. I also get their salmon bento which comes with yummy dumplings and veggie tempura. Their regular sweet potato rolls are also great. Loads of coworkers eat there all the time. I only wish they got larger to-go containers and combined more things instead of using a ton of medium sized styrofoam containers, I feel like I'm destroying the environment single handedly every time I eat here."}
{"text":"always delicious! We usually get the Crazy for salmon or a platter and it's always super fresh! Love this place"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The special bento combo was generous in portion and quite fresh.  The food presentation was also good.  We've been there twice and had never had problems with getting seats.    Spicy Tartar and Beef Tataki were interesting and unique."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food AND service!   After trying out many sushi places in downtown Toronto, I decided to travel a bit further. Kudos to the yelpers who recommended this place. It is now one of my top rated sushi restaurants around.   Even though I don't remember the names of the combos that my friend and I ordered, I have posted pictures that you can check out. The one that I ordered was on the Lunch Special menu. It came with six pieces of red snapper, fresh salmon, and tuna sushi, as well as six maki rolls with tempura bits in them. The fish was RAAW and FRESH! the way that they were presented on my plate definitely enhanced my appetite. Also, they were really generous on the wasabi and ginger.   The maki had a perfect ratio of rice to filling, or at least by my standard. The filling was crunchy and savory, yet soft to the tongue. The combo also came with a salad and miso soup. My combo came to $12, well worth it!  The servers were really patient and prompt on refilling the tea. We spent around an hour there comfortably. I would visit more frequently if I lived closer to LIberty village!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Raaw Japanese Cuisine. Angela and her staff are amazing and always go above and beyond. I am Celiac and there are very few restaurants I can trust to eat at. The personalized experience I have received, in addition to their understanding of my allergy, is impeccable.  Not only that, but their sushi is fresh and always consistent.  Thank you Raaw!"}
{"text":"Service can be that one factor that takes a meal from 'good' to 'great'. Case in point: my first date experience at Raaw last week.  Fortunately for me this was actually an awesome first date. We talked the entire meal and barely noticed the amazing decor and ambience. Sidebar, definitely excited for date numero dos :) at Leslie Jones. In between our family-work-play stories the friendly waitress filled up our green tea and water. She was also kind enough to double check if the sushi should come on separate plates, when I told her I was vegan. And might I add the Veggie Blast was the best veggie roll I've had in ages. It wasn't boring in the least, but a tad too large for eating while trying to have a conversation and stay first-date attractive. Thankfully my date thought it was cute, even though I felt like I had a football in my mouth.  I also appreciated the waitress' confidence speaking and obvious grasp of English. She didn't hesitate to ask questions and make suggestions. It was nice to be out eating international cuisine but not having to worry about an international language. While not all restaurants are like this I find I'm less likely to go back to restaurants where the servers had difficulty understanding me.   Now, like I said, we talked the entire meal, so much so, that we didn't notice them closing up. They didn't make us feel bad about it though and let us scarf down the last few bites of our meal.  An overall great experience and I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Outstanding rolls at a decent price.  Very creative, fresh and tasty large rolls.  Nice manager/owner who will create custom rolls for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Their signature dish \"spicy salmon tar tar\" is my fav..must try"}
{"text":"This retaurant which is tucked away so that no one can find it is disappointing. I live in Liberty and was excited when a sushi place opened. The interior is depressing, dark, and who ever thought that orange was a good idea should be hung. Turn the lights on!!  The prices are way too high. Just stick to the tried and true. Sushi doesn't need improving it's already perfect. Don't get all funky with it.  The place is reminiscent of a concrete gym that needs to be decorated.   Note to chef: There is supposed to be some sticky rice with the sushi. I had to ask for a bowl of rice on the side which of course I was handsomely charged for.   Try to avoid this place and instead head up to Mazz on Bloor at Westmoreland. Much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I live nearby so I've only done pickup. Some sushi rolls are better than others, I haven't liked everyone I've tried. They're fresh and nothing wrong, just some interesting combinations IMO.  BUT the chicken katsu is so tasty!!! I can't order without also getting it. I definitely recommend trying it. I usually only get sushi at other Japanese restaurants but here I seem to prefer the other dishes."}
{"text":"The Sushi is freshly made in front of you with tasty ingredients. The place is a little spartan inside. It's a little hard to find, tucked in the back. Staff were courteous. It was smack in the middle of price, not cheap, but not expensive. Miso soup was good."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. The first time I came here over a year ago I was delighted by the artistic presentation and tastiness of the food.  I came back for a second time expecting the same quality but was sadly disappointed. First, the restaurant was completely empty but we were seated at the very back of the room at the dirtiest table. We had to explicitly ask the server to clean it for us, when it was apparent that she wasn't going to on her own. We ordered several rolls but there was no presentation to them at all-- in fact, they were falling apart on the dish. I give them an extra half star for the large rolls that still tasted pretty good. The beef don bowl we also ordered was drenched in soy sauce and served in a bowl chipped in 4 spots.  I'm not sure if the restaurant changed management but service was spotty, the space seemed dirty and the quality of food seemed to have gone downhill from a year ago. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally reviewing after having been several times. The interior isn't great. A big empty room painted black. It feels cavernous and cold, but this is more than made up for elsewhere. The staff are friendly and do warm up the place and the service is generally very prompt. There's a reasonable saki selection, and the staple Sapporo and Asahi. Then there's the food. We have yet to have something here that we didn't like. Fish is fresh and flavourful. We've enjoyed many of the sushi and sashimi platters and the rolls are consistently good. We don't do much of the kitchen food, but the tempura is light and crispy. My fave has to be the Maguro Drop. Thin sliced tuna wrapped around a ball of tempura bits, crab stick, ginger, avocado and a honey wasabi sauce. The tuna is pinched closed at the top so it looks like a giant tuna dumpling. 2 per order and they are just brilliant. Prices are comparable or just a bit more than sushi places of this caliber, but well worth it.   Sue: After several visits and several take-out times I love this place. The staff are great, the owner is always friendly and helpful in suggesting new dishes etc. The food is consistently good across the board. We've tried the chef platter and are always surprised by something new and flavoursome. I find the atmosphere more than acceptable and it's never noisy which is nice when trying to converse with your dining partner. I cannot say I have a favourite dish as I've never had anything I didn't like here. I have to agree that our newest find is the Maguro Drop and is to die for.  Overall Raaw provides great value for money, a wonderful selection of good quality, fresh and flavoursome food. This would be a great place to take someone who hasn't had sushi before or at the very least experienced something beyond the AYCE sushi places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a pretty significant step above places like New Gen and Sushi on Bloor.   I can understand why people wouldn't like it as they're quite liberal with the sauce on their maki. The large house sake is a good deal.  If you're looking for good a sushi restaurant, but nothing out of this world, then this place will do just fine. Also, if you live in or are visiting Liberty Village, this is your only sushi option."}
{"text":"Raaw is my go-to sushi spot in Liberty Village.  Fresh maki and sushi every time I visit.  I love their udon soup, warm, comforting and yummy noodles!  Service is great here, my cup was never empty of tea.  This place is tuck away in the Liberty Market area.  Be sure to check this place if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I came here because I work in Liberty Village and it seemed good. I came at lunch but decided not to opt for the lunch specials (looked delicious and were very decently priced) since I wanted to get the Special Bento - this would allow me to try several items on the menu all at once. This Bento costs $16 and it is enormous. I couldn't finish it. I have to say that I don't give it high marks only because the sushi part was delicious, but I was disappointed by the tempura, salad and the teriyaki. The miso soup is excellent. I found that the teriyaki, though well cooked and well seasoned, was simply drawing in the sauce. It was too much sauce. The tempura was also good but the tempura batter was heavy on the shrimp. As for the salad, I just didn't like it. There was something about the dressing that just turned me off...  I also found the restaurant very dark. It's probably very nice at night though.  Would I go back? Definitely. But I would stick to the miso soup and the sushi/maki rolls."}
{"text":"In a city that is saturated with Sushi options, I am sick of the same old cheap bento box. This is my new favourite! Simply put, the food is good quality and the prices are totally reasonable. The atmoshere is a little dark, and at times really quiet, but it is a good option if you live or work in the area."}
{"text":"Good selection ( actually pretty good) decent pricing but not good attitude. They say on the signs \"Ask about the specials\" you ask and they always reply with \" it's in the menu.\" Been here several times due to its location and good selections but would love the place to drop the attitude."}
{"text":"Disgusting ! this place has to go. Dirty tables all the time, flies and doesnt taste that good. Over priced  as well"}
{"text":"Discovered this place with a good friend of mine on my last trip to Toronto. We were the first ones in for lunch that day and the place quickly filled up. Seems as though they deliver to other businesses in the Village, which is a great service and a really good way to build referrals.  I loved the Salmon Tartare so much that we ended up coming back later in the day and picked up some more for dinner! Reasonably priced for Liberty Village and the staff were super friendly. I look forward to coming back for some more awesome food next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"There is just something so fresh about this place. As an employee in the Liberty Village area, this has become my goto Japanese spot for lunch. There are some other options in the area such as Kotta at King and Dufferin or a few on Atlantic Avenue but the quality of the ingredients here are far and away the best.  I tend to get the Sashimi 'Raaw Plate' and you will not be disappointed by the freshness. The Salmon is non fatty, the tuna is similar, and just a delightful meal for the quality of product.  Even with the Maki there is a noticeable taste difference when they include the sesame seeds, the rice is cooked to perfection (no hard bits, etc). Gyoza's are not undercooked or over oily.  Best Miso soup for aftertaste I've ever had and even the ginger is great (with no pink dye)!  Pros: Freshest Japanese food you will find in the area. Tastiest Japanese in the area.  Cons: Can be pricier, but really you get what you pay for. Not exactly the best ambiance for a dinner date with the warehouse feel."}
{"text":"Delicious! the ingredients are fresh and the flavours pop. I ordered the age tofu which had terrific texture - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and it was in this lovely broth almost topped with bonito flakes.  Also get the volcano maki - seared salmon, spicy mayo, scallop - so good. Whenever I order spicy sushi at places, it barely registers on the taste buds. This exploded with flavour and it had a great spice level.  Now if only they could have an AYCE.... theres just so much more I want to try on that menu!"}
{"text":"Great place in LV. Staff is very friendly and remembers repeat customers and what they order. I'd absolutely recommend the place to anyone on the west side or in LV looking for their sushi fix."}
{"text":"I love this place for their sushi, sashimi and rolls but everything else is pretty bad. Despite the fact that their stuff from the kitchen (meat variety like teriyaki and noodles) are sub par, I keep going back because they do GREAT sushi and sashimi. Their fish is always fresh and the cut of the fish is always generous.  It's priced reasonably and there are quiet a lot of options for rolls too. My favourite are very raaw and california blast. They really have a huge variety of delicious and innovative rolls.  One thing I do hate about the place is their decor.  The walls are painted BLACK and the decor is VERY stark. It looks like someone's really bad imitation of a tim burton set or something in their basement. There is never enough light and the place never seems warm and inviting because of their horrendous decor. But the food is good unless you order their teriyaki (which is too sweet and with runny sauce and undercooked veggies) or noodles (with soggy, overcooked noodles in bland tasteless soup)"}
{"text":"Rolls were mediocre and very small with very little flavour. The chicken gyoza we ordered was cold and we live only 3 minutes from the restaurant. We did not get nearly enough food for how much it cost, we will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Go Now! This place is a MUST TRY.  I am very bored of the japanese restaurants in Toronto.  You have either the fine dining Japanese that costs you an arm and leg, and your still not full. Or you have all the fake japananese on Yonge, Queen, you know what i'm talking about.  They have a very interesting menu. I had the salmon tartar, yellowtail jalapeno. I never see any of these items in other restaurants.  i really like their specialty maki, funky chicken, very raaw, fire dragon. There are many more things I want to try as their menu is huge, but 2 girls could only eat so much. For all the drinkers, try the SAKE MOJITO. Its very different light and refreshing. I'm craving for it as I\"m thinking of the menu. sigh, bottom line just go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed until I was about to move away from liberty village. The prices are very reasonable, and since most people in the neighborhood order out, you can get a whole restaurant to yourself. Sushi is pretty good, and the basics are food. Prices are reasonable.   I take a star off because the unagi don was just so disappointing."}
{"text":"Eh, I think there has to be better sushi places than this. I ordered a spicy tuna roll, and part of it was mixed with panko bread crumbs. Come on...don't cheap out on me by adding fillers to a  roll! :( And don't give me copious amount of radish shreddings when I order sashimi!   The donkatsu meal seems pretty decent though. It comes in a sizzling hot pan with veggies and crispy meat...and the salad that comes with your meal set tastes pretty good too. But I don't know, this isn't a place I'd come over and over again. If I want sushi, I'll go elsewhere for it."}
{"text":"I need to preface this by saying I never actually ate here, but we came here with the intention of eating here. We walked into the small dark place (with high ceilings) and I felt like it was trying too hard.   there was no seat for us, and I noticed all the tables for made for 4 or more.   The guy sat us at the bar, and although the seats were too low Looking at the menu, i didn't understand how under Bento box it said \"Volcano - Salmon, avacado, spicy scallop\" The sushi bar heard me, and told me the menu was wrong and it was actually a roll.   I had a bad feeling about this. How can 4 different rolls be under the Bento Box section of the menu, and they didn't bother to fix it!  The delivery and take out was strewn all over the sushi bar table. Another guy was getting ready to deliver. A lady was trying to organize the takeout. Bu the original guy who sat us was no where to be found.  3 other tables have gotten up and paid, and the tables were not cleared.  It was 15 mins, and we left."}
{"text":"Very cosy place, very good prices, excellent service and awesome food. There really is not much more to say. I've come here multiple times and I always love it."}
{"text":"Looking for a good sushi lunch with friends then this is def your go to place!  Definitely get your money's worth here and everything tastes delicious. Lunch specials all under $10 including salad and misto soups, I had the chicken teriyaki with 6 California rolls, very impressed and my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chirashi and my human ordered a special bento box. Food was fresh, service was fast, and staff were very friendly. I love that the chirashi rice had sushi vinegar in it, which made it distinctively delicious and different from the rice in the special bento box. Their shrimp tempura was tasty too. Batter was sweet. The chicken karaage was the perfect popcorn chicken size and it tasted like real chicken. Yum!! I'd come here again :D"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful sushi restaurant in the Liberty Village district  The staff are attentive and helpful explaining their menu for the newbies  They make a great Tonkatsu for those not into seafood  Try the Maguro Drop which is Tuna wrapped in ginger, tempura, crab and avocado in a honey wasabi sauce.  It will tingle your taste buds  They also make a awesome Eel Dragon Mali with shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado and yes Eel  Eel plays a big part in Japanese cuisine and must be enjoyed regularly  They make great dinner spot with parking, if you are lucky right outside"}
{"text":"Lovvvvvvvve! The food is really good and fresh! They presented it like art. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"I use to order delivery from this place. I haven't done so in couple of years, so I decided to give em a go tonight based on my previous experience.  And let me say this- despite the fact we were hungry, this was the WORST sushi I've had in a long!   Definitely learned my lesson"}
{"text":"Not really a fan of many things in Liberty Village, but Raaw might have to be an exception. Popped in here the other day for dinner and I was really impressed with how delicious everything tasted. We kept it simple: a couple Maki roll dishes, fried tofu, gyoza, and udon noodles. They all tasted great. Very fresh and full of flavours.  Definitely going to be coming back to try more on the menu, but will likely call ahead and get takeout. The restaurant itself lacks an intimate vibe that most sushi places have. Raaw is nestled in a generic retail space of the Village -- with high ceilings and little decor to spruce up the bland atmosphere.  Still the food is very solid and I plan on coming back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place in Liberty Village, I'd been looking forward to trying it for sometime! That said, it didn't really live up to the hype. The sushi here was very mayonnaise-y and not very well constructed. Sashimi was good, so I know the fish was fresh, but you couldn't really taste it in the sushi. Wierdest spicy tuna roll ever, didn't taste like any spicy tuna I've ever had before, and I don't mean that in a good way. Bento box was ok, but nothing special. Service was very nice and accommodating (had baby in tow, lots of food on the floor!). I'd had high hopes for this place after reading some of the early reviews, but food was just so-so. The restaurant itself is faux-stylish and faux-cool, overall just felt kind of cold and sterile. Could use some more life and personality! I think the vast majority of their business is takeout and delivery. Good for them!"}
{"text":"Sorry but no..never coming back. Service is fine, decor was fine. Food was deplorable. I had the tuna tataki and some maguro drop? Not fresh, the tataki was soaked in oil...sorry but never again."}
{"text":"This is typical 'lunch sushi' place with sushi specials and bento boxes.  The bento boxes are quite well priced for the amount you get, and the sushi is good most of the time, but sometimes not.  Their 'spicy' sauce is very greasy and tasting ... hmmm.. strange... so I'd avoid ordering the 'spicy' sushi items (which are the same as regular items with 'spicy' sauce on top).  The scallop roll (my favorite) was done with Bay Scallops, not Sea Scallops, which ruined my enjoyment.   The ambiance is nice, with nice chairs and tables and the service is quite good."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons why I came to this restaurant was because I bought a wagjag coupon that was worth $25 in food.  I ended up going with one of my good friends who conveniently works at Liberty Village.  The decor was ver chic and modern - walls were all dressed in black.  There weren't many seats, and it was such a shame that there weren't too many people there.  Possibly due to location, I found that it was fairly empty.  Service was impeccable.  Our waitress was very friendly and talkative.  My friend and I ordered the following: 1) SALMON SPICY TARTAR:  Finely chopped salmon mixed in with spicy sauce and tempura, on top of a small amount of rice.  This was my favourite.  Definite recommend. 2) RAAW PLATE:  Chef's choice of sashimi.  We had salmon, red tuna, white tuna, octopus, surf clam, and some other fishes that I'm not sure of.  The presentation of this was amazing.  The fishe were on top a plate of ice that was lit with a blue light from the bottom.  Fish was fresh as well. 3) BANZAI ROLL:  Eel, salmon, tuna, avocado, tempura bits, spicy sauce wrapped in cucumber.  Presentation was really good, despite the fact that you couldn't really see what was *in* the roll.  The cucumer wrap was refreshing after eating all that fish with soya sauce.  In total, I believe we spent about $42 that evening (with the wagjag coupon, we only had to pay $17 in cash).  Great place to go to -- defintie recommend for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I created an account for Urbanspoon just to write this review, so naturally it will be negative.  I went there at around 3pm after working out at Goodlife for a quick meal. The place was completely empty, I was the only customer. I ordered the Raaw Plate $17 and was very disappointed.  This is the first time in my life that I ordered Sashimi and it never came with a side of rice to go with my meal.  Typically when you order Sashimi, you get served vinegar rice otherwise you will leave pretty hungry. If I was ordering Sushi, I understand you don't get vinegar rice as a side, since Sushi already has rice around the raw fish. Pretty basic stuff. Rice cost practically nothing.  The food was also very mediocre, very thinly sliced fish by Japanese restaurant standards. I don't see this place lasting much longer at this rate, similiar to the Noodle place in the corner that is now replaced by Origins Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Good value for money.  I usually get the bento box for lunch.  The chicken teriyaki is much better than the beef.  Maki rolls and sushi are nothing special but good enough."}
{"text":"Average.  Expensive and not worth the price. Lacks presentation. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my two visits. Ordered sashimi and spicy tuna and salmon rolls. Delicious. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I think this place is under rated. They offer unique maki, fast and friendly service with fair pricing, I've gone a few times with different friends and no one has ever left hungry or unhappy. It's a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Pros: This place reminds me of Nobu in Vegas.  The resemblance would be the zesty sauce they use on their summer fresh roll - the mango on the roll was very refreshing and appetizing for a Summer's night.  I wouldn't say this fine dine quality like Nobu, but for the quality you get at this price range, I consider this a hidden gem tucked away inside Liberty Village. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable gave us a couple of good recommendations.   Cons: The only thing that makes this review short of 1 star is the lighting. I have a preference for a well lit environment when it comes to restaurant settings.   Conclusion: Overall friendly service and knowledgeable staff. Food was good and refreshing.  I would definitely come back the next time I visit Liberty Village."}
{"text":"This place is good, a little pricy.  Overall very tasty and cool items on the menu, but not the best sushi in the world."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Japanese place with worst workers in it!  Bad food, bad attitude.  I do not recommend this place at all.  The service I received today was just WOW, it was sooooo bad!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal - we were pleasantly surprised.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  The decor was a little minimalist - one nice accent wall, but then it looks like they ran out of money for decorations.  The food was fresh and tasty.  Both the Funky Chicken maki and the soup broth were remarkable.  Plus, our meal was very affordable."}
{"text":"Pretty low key place, ideal for Lunchtime.   Reasonably price and attentive in their service, I would have enjoyed more if the decor matched the great the quality of the food. Great for lunch or take out but a notch under what I'd expect for even the most basic dinner spot."}
{"text":"The absolute worst sushi place. I came here twice. First time I was mortified by the two female waitress. Food was average and PRICEY.  My last time was the worst. Again, the two moody, and rude waitresses served food that was overpriced and the bathroom is filthy and gross.  How can they stay in business with such miserable staff? I highly suggest In Japan. It's inexpensive and the staff is friendly. Food is great too!   AVOID IF YOU ARE SMART :)"}
{"text":"This place still rocks.  I have ordered in two more times plus stopped in to eat at the restaurant once (since my initial review) and it was just awesomesauce all the way."}
{"text":"3.5 star with room for improvement!  On a Sunday night when the Liberty Village is quiet like a ghost town.. I wonder around looking for RAAW.. Almost want to give up seems like everything were closed! But what I will do for my Sushi fix? Nothing can stop me.. the only thing I hope was that it still opened when I found it!   Raaw from outside looked dark.. inside is dark too.. There were only another table aside from myself tonight..   Reading through the menu, I found the price here seems reasonable for location inside Liberty Village   Chef's Sushi ($15) includes salad and Miso soup  - The Salad was nicely presented in a bowl.. nice spring mix with different greens not just the lettuce, tomato and cucumber.. (+0.5 star)  - The Miso soup though has good but was served lukewarm.. just like my waitress...  - The nigiri sushi was a pleasant surprise! Good selections of fish, the cut was big.. (Salmon, Tuna, Shrimp, Octopus, Snapper, and even have my \"favourite\" Saba..)  - The Maki rolls are both spicy.. tuna and salmon.. I love spicy rolls so I have no complain..but I wondering since it is the Chef's choice and what if someone doesn't eat spicy?   Seriously this place really have to \"lightened\" up! Not it is so dark and hard to take good photos, and it is a good idea for us to really look and admire what we are eating before we put in our mouth.. that's the part of enjoying your food!   The staffs here all speak Cantonese.. even the Sushi Chef. The waitress though really courteous kept checking if my tea is filled and if I like my food, but she does sounded blunt.. smile and lightened up.. that will make a difference!"}
{"text":"Very happy with my meal. I ordered for takeout: a salmon sushi pizza, a spicy tuna roll and an eel dragon roll.  The salmon sushi pizza is how you would expect; deep fried rice patty topped with salmon sashimi and sauce. It was good.  The spicy tuna roll and eel dragon roll were both so fresh. Great tasting sushi. This was my first time trying Raaw and I will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"My first reaction was that the waitress was super friendly! A friend and I came around mid afternoon and were seated immediately (there were about two other customers when we came in, so the place was empty). After a long look at their menu, I decided to get the Raaw Sushi lunch special while my friend got the Crazy 4 Salmon. We also split some takoyaki.   The lunch special is really a bang for your buck. Priced at what I believe was either 11 or 13 dollars, you get the house salad, miso soup, and platter of sushi. In comparison, while the Crazy 4 Salmon had a little more sushi on its plate (+ sashimi), it was also 19 dollars.  I wasn't feeling too well that day, so I didn't have much appetite. The portions would have been just right if I was feeling better, but I felt a little overstuffed while eating. To warn some people, the nigiri does have wasabi already in it. I like wasabi, but there are people bothered by the spiciness.   All the employees at Raaw Sushi are very friendly. Their customer service is A+. Since my friend and I were splitting the bill, they even split the cost of the takoyaki for us, which was helpful. I have very high praise for them. I would love to come back again some time.   On a side note, the washroom was a little nastier than expected compared to the outside."}
