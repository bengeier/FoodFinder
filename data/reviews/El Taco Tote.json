{"text":"Not really fast, not fine dinning either. Casual place to get tacos with handmade tortillas (corn and flour). Mexican sodas, beer, Jamaica, and Horchata. Good food, at fair prices. The salsa bar is a plus."}
{"text":"I went into this place not expecting a whole heck of a lot but was impressed. I have a weakness for Mexican food and these kind of places are why. Loved the salsa bar I had a little of everything just to see and they were all tasty! My quesadilla was one of the best I've had, love the homemade tortillas. The food in the room I didn't get to taste looked good too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Do not order the fish tacos! In a word, horrible. After waiting for some time for them, I take them back to my office  only to find a tortilla filled with over fried, over-coated  fish.  I couldn't even discern if there was any fish inside the burnt-tasting crust. Just a couple of shreds at least. Stick with the chicken, beef. They should totally take it off the menu if they can't do it right. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place takes the cake when it comes to good food fast!  Used to come here for lunch while working in the area.  Basically order one of there combos, or create your own tacos.  Lot's of different meats to choose from.  Fresh tortillas being pressed in front of you, what more can you ask for? The salsa bar has a lot of choices.  I miss you el taco tote, haha."}
{"text":"Sour cream is very good also it is unlimited so stock up. They come in little packages so maybe grab a few extra and take them home"}
{"text":"I love when I go visit my son at School (GCU) We get to go here its our favorite in Phx.."}
{"text":"Very good food , place is always packed!!!!! Go there for lunch at least 2 times week !"}
{"text":"We live nearby and have visited a few times. Every time we go, the dining room looks trashed. If they cannot keep the restaurant clean, then I would hate to inspect the kitchen. 

The food is somewhat tasty, but pricey. Too expensive for eating in the messy dining room. I don't mind paying for good food, but if I cannot enjoy it without worry over my health then it is definitely worth skipping this place by driving down Camelback Road toward the city center."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Great salsa bar handmade tortillas fantastic prices I cannot recommend this company more! Do yourself a favor next time you're down around Grand Canyon University and stop in and get lunch"}
{"text":"This is what Carne Asada is supposed to taste like.  The meat is so flavorful you can it by itself, with no salsa or toppings.

The little tacos are really tasty and the salsa bar is pretty great too.

If you order the full size tacos then you get freshly made tortillas.  That is a sign of a serious taco shop.

The food is not cheap but they make up for it with big portions and free chips."}
{"text":"Really good for fast food!!  The taco shells were handmade and very good.  Loved the salsa bar!  Very quick and very clean!  Won't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Las mejores salsas que e probado ...todo muy rico los desayunos muy especiales y el personal muy amable todo muy limpio un lugar para volver a ir en familia ......"}
{"text":"Well is Tuesday may 5 2015, 9:40 PM I asked for the Sirloin combo, very expensive for 2 tacos that fall apart as soon as you get them out of the aluminum foil wrap, I know the difference between sirloin and carne asada tacos, apparently they don't, well let's make it short, the only good thing here is the salsas but you are paying to much for salsa, this place is getting worse every day,  1 star is my rating I really don't recomend this fast taco place any more, on previous reviews I gave them a 5 star rating, but the tortillas were thick before and the tacos were full of meat and the charro beans were delicious,  now you can find better tacos across the street, Bye Bye taco tote, unless I'm really hungry and you are the only taco place around, then you'll see me again."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place is average, but it all averages out to average.

Nice salsa bar. Good pastor, but not great. Good adobada, but not great. Self service ordering with table delivery that's a little erratic. Meal showed up first, then the margarita. It was hard to find chips to have with the salsa. It's in a old Denny's with a bright paint job added. The booths were spaced out oddly. If I sat back in my booth, I was about a meter away from my food."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced. We ordered barbacoa dinner platters incl drinks for two ppl $24. Food was not bad, not great either, I've tasted better. the flour tortillas were undercooked. One of the workers was rude and was complaining about a chip on the floor that she had to sweep up. Uh isn't that her job to do?"}
{"text":"aaaaahhhhhh best steak tacos EVER
(fyi chicken was not so great)
and an awesome salsa bar - you can add as much onions and cilantro as you want.."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. The food was very dry. Not fresh at all. The rice and beans were so dry not even salsa was able to bring them back from the dead. I ordered the chicken burrito. The chicken was really gross tasting. It wouldn't let me give zero stars that's why it gets one."}
{"text":"This is the better of the two locations,  the west side started skimping on the meat so we switched to this one.  Their chicken adobado is amazing, the salsa bar is possibly the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth, they have a decent beer selection, and all you can eat homemade chips.  Everything is fresh and you get a lot of food for the money. I eat there almost weekly and have never had a bad experience.

Also, if you live near them they deliver now, so you don't even have to make that hellacious drive down Country Club :)"}
{"text":"This place is unsanitary beyond belief. Don't get me wrong the foods half bad, but the cleanliness of the place is what really made my stomach queeze. I spent one hour in there, and within that time I saw food being taken from the dining room back behind the line to add sour cream for instance, this Is a big time health code violation. Not only that but I was sitting at the table eating, and one of the waitresses came by and picked up my USED napkin and placed it on the floor to clean up a mess.. I get it you're authoring authentic Mexican food, but you still need to follow American health and safety standards."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this place. My husband finally took me after years of him going on his own. I had pretty high expectations since he'd talked it up so highly. It's a huge restaurant, and for good reason, the place was packed! 
We walked up to the line in front of the counter, they had a large selection of meats to choose from and you also select corn or flour tortillas. My husband ordered sirloin, shrimp, and chicken. I ordered shrimp, sirloin, and fish. We also ordered our free yelp check-in item which was a bean and cheese taco and and drink. They give you your number once you pay, and then seat yourself. Once in the main dining area you are able to fill our soft drinks and they also provide little containers for you to scoop chips into. From there they have a pretty awesome salsa bar. All of the salsas have some zip to them. On the bar they also have items like lettuce, cucumbers, radishes, pico, red onions, marinated onions, limes, and cilantro. 
The food took a little while so it was good that they had the chips and salsa while you wait. Finally we got our food and the tacos all had a good amount of meat to them. The fish was good, but a tad bit dry, it needed a creamy element to it. The sirloin and chicken were good and had nice flavor. The shrimp scared us at first because there was a bunch of mystery sauce that the shrimp had all over it. But overall I think the shrimp and sirloin were my favorite. I'd probably just get those two next time. 100% recommend and wish there was a location closer to us!"}
{"text":"To hard to rate this one. I need to break it down:
- flavor of the meat (sirloin) : 5 stars, excellent
- quality of meat : 3 ,stars very fatty
- chips : 2
- salsas : 3
- tortillas : 5 homemade!

Over all the experience is nothing short of well, chaos. The service was polite and helpful but it had a generally feeling of disorder. The family style ordering is unique for a casual Mexican food restaurant. It's definitely different. The portion size is good and it is definitely popular. They get a lot of people through quickly but it feels like it. It's a little crazy in here."}
{"text":"The food was good but I was hoping for more of an intimate type atmosphere. Go here if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind a loud atmosphere. Stay away if a mellow experience is what you are after."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  Trying to redeem the check in deal was told that the special is expired and it's no good, when I just ordered $40 worth of food Togo.  The cashier was rude so was the manager..  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty great Mexican food, if a bit greasy. All of their items are superb, really, but I prefer their bistek quesadilla."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've had in a very long time! And they have a awesome salsa bar and free chips!

The price adds up real quick but definitely worth it! I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"I had to wait for a tire to be put on my Gold Wing and came here for lunch. I thought this place was crazy good.I started off with fresh hot tortillas, fresh salsa bar, & all you can eat tortilla chips. I had the Chili Relleno combo plate with rice & beans. Everything tasted fresh & hot. This place was great, I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good food! Tacos are made with homemade flour tortillas and tripas were nice and crispy! Loved it!"}
{"text":"The Tacos ARE Over Priced. The beef meat was full of fat. I was not pleased with the food quality or the service."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Taco Tote. Sad to see other locations closed but this one is still open. We get the family pack. The salsa bar is the best! Their tortillas are always made to order and so yummy and thick."}
{"text":"I'm a native of  El Paso, TX, so my love of this place is by no means new.  I can remember when the only place I could get their food was in Juarez, Mexico, which is literally a hop, skip and jump away from El Paso.  My friends and I usually made a day of it; a little shopping, a \"little\" drinking, and a lot of tacos.  This was probably like 18 years ago.  Imagine my excitement when they opened their first restaurant in El Paso.  It was right next to the university I went to (UTEP), so as a \"starving\" student, I used to fill up on their cucumbers and guacamole salsa at their condiment bar. 

My husband I moved to Phoenix back in 2000.  Needless to say, I really missed the food from El Taco Tote.  Holy crap!  I was ecstatic when they opened a restaurant in Tuscon.  I'm famous for saying that I'll go anywhere for food, this was certainly no exception.  A little two hour trek for DELICIOUS tacos was well worth the drive.

OK, so obviously, I just about shit my pants when they opened one in Phoenix on Camelback and 35th Ave.  I went on their grand opening week and relished in their amazing, hot off the grill, beef fajita tacos.  They have something called the \"Taco Tote Pack\".  It comes with two tacos of your choice and a gigantic baked potato.  I agree, that's a little weird, but that does not take away from it deliciousness.  You are seriously getting incredibly fresh ingredients, as you can even see the ladies making fresh tortillas as you wait for your food.  Where this place gets even better is at their taco-topping wonderland.  You have every conceivable salsa and topping that allows you to have your tacos \"your way\".  

I agree with the last review by John V. that the place a bit chaotic, but I think that's part of it's charm.  So if you're in the mood for an unpretentious place, with fantastic tacos, El Taco Tote will definitely  hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've had better tacos at street stands. But service and ambient was good."}
{"text":"This place has great food but there service is super shitty. They decided that we only get 1 pack of sour cream for 4 people and wanted to make me pay 27 cents for another one. I will probably go here again but there service can lick my asshole. I will probably never be friendly to them because they suck."}
{"text":"The lunch special was a great deal when it was 4.99.  Unfortunately it went up one dollar.  The chicken and pork is hit or miss...some days it's great, but others it seems undercooked and strange tasting in the case of the chicken, or too fatty in the case of the pork.

The salsa is excellent.  You can also get a baked potato with your lunch, which is a nice change.  

The other meats are pretty good, but more expensive."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and I loved the salsa bar but one thing is clear here. Poor customer service....I walked in and was starred at by the employees as they called out some lady. The lady comes out some corner while counting money (manger lady?) and says in a not so pleasant voice \"go to other register\". Okay, so I go to other register as I wait for her to finish counting money. Keep in mind I've been waiting to have my order placed for about 6 minutes and I was the only customer in line to place an order. So she turns and gets upset at someone while taking my order and never once smiles or seem cherry throughout my experience  here. 

So, I get my order and sit down to enjoy my Mexican food and I notice that every employee here seems quiet and down. I've been to several Mexican restaurants and they seem very happy and welcoming. Then I here the same lady who took my order scold her the employees in front of all the customers! My goodness lady does someone need a career change? 

Overall food was good but I think next time I'll hit a friendlier environment."}
{"text":"Horrible , 1) The prices for there food are too much for the quantity your getting. 2) last time me and my fiancé went , they were out of chips from the time we got there to the time we left the lady's kept telling us 5 more minutes there cooking , yet nothing . 3) they had got my order messed up with another family's and we were quit upset especially the time period it took for our food to get out to us . Never returning horrible . Ponchos Mexican restaurant on central is our new joint ! Great food , & they always have fresh chips lol"}
{"text":"Greta meat and great flavors. I have eaten at the original in Juarez Mexico several times when living there. This one was just as great on service and quality of food as the original one. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very good authentic mexican food. Great salsa bar. Very good prices."}
{"text":"Nothing beats seeing homemade fresh tortillas made right in front of your eyes.  Barbocoa and bean and cheese are my favorite tacos here.. on flour tortillas.  Employees were very friendly and helped me feel comfortable and safe with the staff.  Will be back to try some other menu items.  My only issue is that is is a bit far from where I live and work but I do go by on Camelback from time to time."}
{"text":"esta delicioso los tacos riquisimo.estilo mexicano.las tortillas hechas a mano . su salsas .y muy buen ambiente .."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. Ordered chicken adobado, received pork. I let the staff know, and they forgot about the order until i asked again. The final straw was that they then gave our order to someone else, which was returned after he opened and unwrapped it, and they gave us that same order. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"The tacos were an okay quality but the price did not reflect that. I've been to upscale Taco shops that would charge the same price this chain is charging. I wasn't completely disappointed since they had a salsa bar that piqued my interest with the unlimited supply of chips at my hand. The only reason I didn't give three stars was because of their drink policy at the time I had went. I ordered their horchata and upon drinking it I realized it wasn't that great. As I went back to return it they had a sign at the register stating drinks could not be exchanged. This informed me that they were aware of the problem of people not being satisfied with their drink order and asking to switch it out. That should tell them that maybe they should fix the problem on their end and make some adjustments to their non alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"A neighbor of mine had been telling me about this place.  We live about 45min away.  I was in the area and stopped in for lunch.  I'm a sucker for street tacos.  It is the first thing I seek out when in Mexico or any hole in the wall.   This place was awesome!
Tortillas were being made next to me while I ordered the daily special 3 tacos.  I had the Cana Asada.  The meat was lean and had great flavor.  The Salsa bar was the best I have seen.  Drink selection was great! The help your self warm chips were fantastic.
Big Fan!  I will be back"}
{"text":"Love bringing the family here for sunday dinners.. best time to go is during the week day when every one is at work cause it does get pretty busy cause the food is so deliscious"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place to get tacos!  Its real mexican food and it has so much flavor.  Lots of sauce choices and lemons.  Best place to go after the gym or with friends.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"When i used to go to gcu me and my boyfriwnd would stop in here several times and let me just say this is the best mexican food ive had in a very long time. It tasted authetic and fresh. The food came out fast and they even have complimentry chips and salsa which we loved. An absolute favorite of ours and we hope to be back in the future :)"}
{"text":"The tacos tasted good, but its over priced for sure. I've gotten better quality at a cheaper price. Beans and rice were a disappointment. I did like the chip and salsa bar as well."}
{"text":"Really authentic Mexican food! I moved away from AZ a few years ago, and on the east coast Mexican food is nothing like in AZ. Whenever I go back to AZ I always go here to get some yummy Mexican food just like I would get in Mexico! 

Highly recommend but don't expect 5 star dining...authentic Mexican! It's just like eating south of the border!"}
{"text":"This place is average at best and food is overpriced. I had chicken adobado, shrimp and barbacoa tacos. 

The chicken adobado was marinated in a simple vinegar marinade and while it wasn't over cooked, it wasn't very good.

The shrimp was unseasoned and small. I wouldn't have it again and it's definitely not worth $4.29.

The barbacoa was the best of the three but was very fatty. Definitely not worth $3.99. 

Despite the poor value the place is packed. At least the beer is cold."}
{"text":"New to area.  Used Yelp to find a place to eat.  Thank you Yelp.

Greeted by manager (owner?).  Made us feel very welcomed. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Best of all, the food was fresh and delicious.  Lots of wonderful choices.  Can't wait to go go back."}
{"text":"Have visited several times and every time I am so very AMAZED at how delicious this food is! I always get the quatro taco plate. and I absolutely LOVE the mild guacamole salsa! the chips are always fresh and warm. It can get pricey but I would say worth it. Went last night and I can't wait to go back! Will definitely have to go for breakfast one day soon! I LOVE EL TACO TOTE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really good and their salsa bar is the best. The tacos of barbacoa are my favorite. Their mangonada is so good you have to try it."}
{"text":"Yum tacos.. Awesome salsa bar.. Near my campus... All things bueno.."}
{"text":"delicious!! From El Paso and food has the same great flavor. restaurant is a little dirty and in need of some updating. friendly staff and great salsa bar."}
{"text":"Food is good here!  A little bit pricey if you ask me. Really good Carne Asada.  Quick service!!! Food variety is great!!! Had a shrimp burrito and it was loaded with shrimp but not a ton of seasoning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places in the valley. So fun to go here and eat family style. Buy meat by the pound and try a couple different flavors and fresh tortillas come with it. All you can eat Chips (made fresh) and a huge salsa bar with so many choices. Best salsa bar in town!
So I'm deducting one star because most of the staff does not speak English. Normally I wouldn't complain as many small excellent restaurants have this problem. But I have had trouble ordering, and I have one friend who refuses to go because of it. 
However, the prices are great and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"I will say that the Carne Asada is very good here but after that I am not a fan of El Taco Tote.  This is not to say that they are a bad restaurant.  I just don't like their food.

I will say that this location is always packed so they must be doing something right but as far as I am concerned.  Meh.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Asada and adobada are the best.  I really like the different salsas and homemade tortillas are so good."}
{"text":"First timer. Got seasoned chicken in flour tortillas. Not impressed with flavor or quantity. It seemed really dry."}
{"text":"Considering there isn't any \"great\" taco places here in Phoenix, this place is good. We always order the platter for 4 and  it's perfect for my family. Give it a try, can't beat the salsa bar and fresh hand made tortillas. Place is ok, food is good."}
{"text":"Went in there to check it out being a nacho connoisseur.  I was severely disappointed.  For the price paid the good delivered, it was awful.  You can drive a little down the road, not much to Pepe Taco Villa or the Sun Up and get way better chicken nacho's.  And Sun Up has 5 dollar happy hour all day on Sunday for their drinks and food."}
{"text":"The food is good. They have great tacos. We went for my graduation (a family of six) and we ordered two plates of carne asada. The deal included a pack of tortillas and drinks. You make your own tacos, put the meat and so on. They have a salsa station too so that'a great! However, we were thinking that we were going to pay max 60 bucks... but we got chared TWICE. We paid 140 dollars JUST for that. When we asked them to check again, they said they couldn't and that we had to pay that amount, so we had to. The food was not even worth it. We always ate at that place but ever since then we don't... it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos are really good here. I got the Barbacoa and asado and they were really good. They need to open a location in the east valley so I don't have to drive all the way to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everyone from the cashiers to the cooks provide friendly and efficient service. If you're ever in the area for some authentic Mexican tacos, stop on by."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The sirloin plate is the way to go. The salsa bar is great, the tortillas are fresh and the staff is friendly.  My family loves it and my staff and I drive up from Health Coach in downtown Phoenix just to have dinner there after work on occasion!"}
{"text":"To start off I haven't been here in years so my boyfriend wanted to try something new. We get to El taco tote and he orders alot.  I only wanted one top sirloin steak taco and one shrimp taco . He got 3 of the top sirloin and some \"panchos\" nachos for appetizer . We got our tacos with flour tortillas. The cashier lady got our order wrong so we paid more and got too much food. I have to say that you should NOT try the shrimp taco it is by far the worst shrimp I have tasted and they mix in a bunch of other stuff with it too. Not too pleasing. On the other hand the top sirloin tacos were very tasty and filling . The nachos were also pretty good. I probably won't come back because I personally think I can find a better Mexican place to eat at. But Overall service did not take too long.  However it is pretty pricey. The little stand in the middle with all the condiments have a very big variety to choose from. The salsas were also good."}
{"text":"Was not bad. I was actually surprised. Menudo was really good and spicy. Their nachos were made for white people, chips smothered with nacho cheese/guac/refried beans topped with meat.

Their sauce station was on point, loved the pico de gallo and guac sauce.

When I come back for work I wouldn't mind going here again."}
{"text":"Not Good Disappointing

This was my first visit to El Taco Tote.  In my opinion  the food just isn't very good. On this visit I ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas, rice, and beans and my lunch companion ordered the chicken tacos,  we were both very disappointed with our entrees.

My lunch companion told me that the chicken tacos were flavorless.  To be perfectly honest, the tacos looked flavorless. The Chicken taco consisted of chunks of chicken in a warm tortilla and the tortilla didn't look very appealing. 

The Green chile chicken enchiladas did not have a lot of flavor, were slightly overcooked, and just had a strange unappetizing taste, as did the rice and beans.

El Taco Tote offeres a salsa bars with various  options, cilantro, salsas,  everything and anything you would want on a taco. However, once again the salas did not have a good taste. The food  just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Taco Tote used to be our favorite.  We ate this once a week maybe.  The problem is that the food quality isn't always good, I guess it depends who's cooking.  Sometimes the food doesn't taste as fresh.  My biggest complaint, the prices on the menu went up but the quality and service is the same.  You pay more if you go during dinner hours for the same food you would eat during lunch.  This does not make sense."}
{"text":"Tonight I had to choose between Great Wall, nearby, or El Taco Tote. I chose El Taco Tote because Yelp has a check-in special. The menu was very confusing. The decor was updated. The service was below par. The restaurant was very busy, and kids were everywhere and out of control. It is obviously a local favorite.

My biggest complaint is the price.
$2.19 for a fountain drink? $7.99 for four meat-only taco's? With the Yelp freebie, my total came to $11.02, and that was the cheapest thing on the menu. It's $3.79 for a SLICE of cheesecake.

The price is likely going to deter me from future visits, and it deterred me from purchasing that cheesecake; which might be a good thing for me, but bad for them as a business. 

Was it good? Sort of. I wouldn't put it any better in quality than Filibertos though. The salsa bar was good, but sad that I had to hit it up twice to get full."}
{"text":"I saw a write up on this place some time ago in the New Times.. figured with the sea of Mexican restaurants over on that side of Mesa this would have to be special to stand out. Does it stand out, meh? It's alright.. the food is very fresh and grilled to order as well as the tortillas. They also have a fresh veggie and salsa bar that pretty decent. The avocado salsa is very good as is the pico de gallo.

Just for me the flavors weren't all there on the meat. I had the biztec and the pork adobado.. both were decent enough but the meat for the biztec just seemed not as fresh as it could have been. If I were in the neighborhood I would certainly stop by again but since I rarely venture to this side of town I'm not sure if Ill ever go back. 

I think Id like to try another location, the one on 35th ave isnt to far from my work.. plus the service was so friendly and well organized.. its worth another shot!"}
{"text":"Don't be deterred by the garish neon and the brightly painted walls. This is a great place to eat. Free serve your self chips and a full salsa bar. Plus free drink refills which is awesome if your looking for an inexpensive meal. My son ordered a massive beef burrito for $6 which we had to split because it was so big. I ended up taking my food home because it was just that much food. They make the tortillas fresh right in front of you with every order. The carne asada  was, dare I say, better then mine. This gets my vote for the best Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So, one day my co-worker asks me if I want the other half of her breakfast burrito. Being the nice co-worker I am, I say yes. I ate the half of burrito around 10am. I was not hungry until nearly dinner time. Not only was the burrito very filling but it was delicious. Even without salsa, the burrito was seasoned very well and you can tell it was homemade versus being typical fast food. Ever since then, when I have $4 I head over for a breakfast burrito to eat for breakfast and lunch. I had their chicken enchiladas as a platter for lunch and the green salsa was so yummy. For $8 I got 3 homemade enchiladas, nachos, re-fried beans, and rice. El Taco Tote is a great place for a lunch or dinner date. It's not formal like Friday's or Carraba's but if you don't have a bunch of money but want great Mexican food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This place used to look super ghetto and run down but they made some improvements and now it looks great. The food is awesome, authentic Mexican, great pricing, great portions. One of my fave Mexican places near campus since I'm a GCU student and it's in walking distance."}
{"text":"Don't trust the 3-star or better reviews.... they probably got some local \"stuff\" in their food.

El Taco Tote is nothing short of being overpriced per the quality.  Perhaps that's because people go there to get free chips and fixings from the salsa bar.  I don't blame them though- I'd probably do the same if I were short on cash.  

Anyways, paying customers dish out around $8-10 per plate.  I tried the \"Quatro Tacos\" (yes, that's \"4 tacos\" in ingles) during my first visit.  It tasted decent, but was not filling and of the quality that I expect considering that I could go somewhere like Sweet Tomatoes and get a better overall experience.

So, if one were to use inductive logic, I'd say there are probably better options out there.  Keep searching!  I can't put my stamp of approval on El Taco Expensivo!"}
{"text":"I give this joint props for their chips and salsa bar - and their tortillas are fresh, but all the protein I tried (chicken / carne asada / pork) was under-seasoned and over-cooked.  It's really close to where I work but despite the convenience I probably won't go back unless it's a taco emergency."}
{"text":"All their tacos are $3 or more each. I have been to cheaper places with good quality tacos. Secondly the wait is very long. The tortillas are freshly made, so that might be why it took so long. It's not bad, but if you're taking the whole family out it will get pricy."}
{"text":"Tacos! Tacos! They're not just for Tuesday!!!

I had been looking for a place like this for a very long time.  Growing up in Las Cruces, NM, we'd frequent El Taco Tote in El Paso whenever we had to go to the airport.  Now...there is one here in Phoenix!

Delicious carne asada tacos and the BEST baked potatoes EVERRR!!  Plentiful salsa bar with all the fixings: cilantro, pickled onions, jalapeños, and all the salsa variety you could ask for.  

Make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"Great tacos for your money. With two I am full. The salsa salad is good. Chips are free to dar."}
{"text":"Everything was very fresh and the salsa bar is always great. The food is just a bit expensive but I guess for freshly made tortillas and freshness you will have to pay a little more. You can order a la carte, meals, or family platter for larger groups. The platters are the best deal for your money."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite thing from their menu is their (Pancho) Yum,Yum! Very descent food--with good prices."}
{"text":"Had my dads Bday here T El Taco Tote.....it was great food.....first time here. Tortillas were hand made n in front of everyone....corn n flour....meats were tender n juicy. All in all dad loved it and walked out like Al Bundy with belt unbuckled n han in pants.....lmao!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place has really great tacos. I was very happy they expanded to the Phoenix area. They first started in Juarez, Mexico and then El Paso. 

Being an El Paso native it is nice to have some really good Mexican food from your hometown. I would give it five stars, but I don't want to be biased."}
{"text":"El Taco Tote is good ol fashioned grilled mexican food.  The chicken and beef fajitas for a party of 2 or 4 are thier signature dishes served on a hot sizzling skillet(cuidado no te quema's) with handmade corn or flour tortillas and sides of whole beans and rice, and ofcorse the endless salsa bar. The flavor is excellent and worth every penny. The setting is ofcorse of mexican a taco shop persona but the equivalent to something like a dennys or ihop, nothing fancy, not run down, just very casual. AND thats exactly what this restaraunt sets out to deliver. 
Restaraunts have to be rated for the food quality and persona they advertise, not by the colors on the wall or the type of people sitting in the booth next to you...Im just sayin."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere to it. The outside looks deceptive but the inside is very nice, dont worry. The food is good, not great. I love that you can eat some chips while you wait for your togo order. It's like a fast food / restaurant mixed concept."}
{"text":"Good tacos  but the salsa needs work. I really like thier tripas. The desert are pre-made pre-packaged outside of the restaurant. The marinade to use for their meat bottled but it's good it's good yeah it's good. If you like American Mexican food this place is good yeah it's it's good."}
{"text":"The meat was good and the taco was good size for the price. I don't have much more to say, if you like tacos i recommend it. I have no complaints, the 4 stars is because we asked for them to put a game on a different tv for us the guy didn't know what channel it was and gave up and left whatever was on."}
{"text":"I came from el paso, and this place reminds me of home. The barbacoa is as i know it, and its delicious! I love it. A little out of my way, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  They make the tortillas and tortilla chips fresh in house!  I love the Pork Adobado, that is my favorite and the salsa variety is great!  They do get super busy though, that's the only downside!"}
{"text":"I ordered via uber eats. I got two fish tacos. Now correct me if I'm wrong but fish tacos usually has fish and I don't know... maybe some cabbage and salsa. No. This taco was fish on a tortilla. I had to choose what salsa I wanted and there wasn't any salsa. so now I'm just here with fish on a tortilla. Yum."}
{"text":"Love the fresh, hot tortillas steaming off your plate, generous portions of carne asada, and the awesome salsa bar."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place suckked. Their carne asada(not) was horrible. Super thick And rubbery. Their onions and cilantro were frozen. And they are wayyyy over priced $70.00 for 12 tacos and the small tacos. Oh and 3 drinks. That does not include rice or beans nothing huge disappointment. I would urge you not to go. Oh and one more thing we waited for ever for our food."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about the best meat I have ever tasted at a fast food Mexican joint. Just incredible. Carne Asada from Heaven"}
{"text":"The salsa bar is delicious and the food is delicious!! The minuses: the horchata tastes a little off and the meat sometimes isn't the cleanest (i.e. a lot of fat and weird little parts left), but overall pretty delicious."}
{"text":"If a place's title has to say they are 'real', then that's always a red flag for me but boy was that thought easily changed for me. Friends parents come here twice a month so decided to check it out. 
They had me at HANDMADE TORTILLAS!! Drool...

We went the route of ordering the meat by the pound which includes 10 tortillas. We got pork adobado and corn tortillas. Then add on the sides and condiments you want...rice beans guacamole. The meat comes to your table on a sizzling plate. Yum!  The tortillas that came with were no small soft taco ones. They were a good size. You could make a small burrito. Although they were a bit soft for my liking (I prefer them denser), they held up well considering how much meat, beans, etc we piled into it. They didn't fall apart like many street tacos do that aren't cooked right. 

Yes, salsa bar is great. I love that they have cilantro and onions separate. They even have cucumber slices!  

Highly recommend. Now I see why the parents come here as often as they can."}
{"text":"I was little hesitant to try this place out at first given that there are thousands of hole in the wall Mexican food places in my neighborhood. But when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and open the restaurant looked and felt. The menu was colorful and everything looked delicious. When we stepped up to the register we were greeted by a pleasant young man and this is where our trip took a turn in to the nightmare that I was sure we would encounter. Upon closer inspection of the friendly young man behind the counter, I noted that his clothes were dirty and his hair was greasy and unkempt. While he was unkempt and dirty, he was polite and obviously new at running the register. He asked the woman that was behind the counter with him, Kimberly, to assist him entering the orders. To which she sneered at him and said in a very rude tone that she didn't have any time to help him. After getting about halfway through our order the young man had to call Kimberly over for assistance, she then mumbled something at me to that I had to ask her to repeat. When I asked if I could get a 50/50 split portion on the meat of the burrito that I ordered she gave me a dark look, turned up her nose and told me flatly \"No.\". Shaking off her bad attitude we took a seat in the clean dining room that staff were busily cleaning and then I noticed the serious fly problem. And when I say serious, I mean there were more flies at our table alone then there were people in the entire building. My fiancé, who was facing the grill then mentioned to me that Kimberly, the same rude woman from the register, was cooking our food and while she was wearing gloves she wiped sweat away with her gloved hand. I pushed this to the back of my mind and waited patiently for our food to arrive. Only, we was met with more disappointment. The food that was given to us was nothing like what was shown on the menu, not even remotely close. Upon tasting it, we found the beans to be canned, the rice to be flavorless. And the tortilla soup? This was the biggest joke of the meal. When it was set down in front of us, we could see a layer of grease congealing on top of it, with lines (not a dollop, but actual lines) of sour cream in some type of lattice style pattern with half of an avocado that still had bits of skin on it. And though we ordered it with chicken, you couldn't prove by me that there was any in there. One taste was all that we needed to know that this was in fact just tomato past with water and grease from the trap under the grill. I find it ironic that your corporation has the audacity to call itself a \"Real! Mexican Grill\" when I could have easily gone to Taco Bell, gotten twice the food for half the money, (food made from ingredients that may also be from a can but actually had some flavor), service with a smile and not worry about fighting the flies to eat my food."}
{"text":"Salsa bar is great. Our one bad experience was enough to keep us from going back, mainly because the quality and value of the food isn't as great as it used to be. We've been long time customers to see the difference. 
We ordered carne asada by the pound, and it was more like half of a pound. I barely had enough to make two tacos (3 people shared, 2 adults, 1 kid) and that's one spoon serving of meat. You are better off to buy the 6 tacos for $15 deal. You'll get more than spending $30. The last couple of times, we had more meat than tortillas, this time we had 4 tortillas leftover and made rice burritos with it. The beans were watery, more juice than beans, the rice is good but had more salt than I like. 
Tortillas are bomb."}
{"text":"After spending the early part of the evening at Sun Devil Liquors, my friend and I realized we had not yet eaten dinner. Problem was, it was a little after 10pm and nothing down the street was open - but El Taco Tote was...The first experience for both of us.

We ordered the quatro tacos and the Panchos. There was a salsa bar in the middle of the room, which wasn't a bad discovery. The pico was a little peppery and had good flavor. The panchos were okay - perhaps because it was late at night they were out of nacho cheese. Nachos without nacho cheese are not the same, but they threw some regular cheese on to replace the deficiency. The quatro tacos were small street tacos, and they were fine. 

The place was descent - especially after our time at the bar and not having dinner, but I don't think I would choose it over Filberto's if they were side-by-side."}
{"text":"It's funny - I wrote a review about another location of this restaurant and wasn't too impressed, but now I come a couple times a week. I usually get the lunch special of two tacos, beans, and rice. It comes with a drink and is a good price. They have the bar with various sauces and fixin's. I like the green and the brown salsas the most. I have had the chicken enchiladas, the potato, and the nachos (not the small nachos, the pachos). All are good. The tacos and enchiladas come plain and you dress them up yourself on the bar. 

Pick up the free chips at the counter. This is one of my two most regular lunch time establishments. If you go at lunch around 12:30 it has been known to be packed. I try to get there at 12 and there are a few people in line, but not as bad."}
{"text":"I find myself making excuses to go down to Grand Canyon University (my son goes there) so that we can dine at El Taco Tote. It is a rare find: clean, efficient place serving authentic Mexican dishes. We took our houseguest from Ensenada and he agreed.  The Borcheta is my favorite, consisting of diced grilled steak, bacon, onions and peppers, served on a sizzling skillet. I smother it with some of the excellent salsas from the salsa bar and eat with the flour tortillas made right in front of my eyes.  We've tried many of the dishes on the menu and haven't had anything we wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"The only reason I would ever consider giving this almost fast food taco place less than 5 stars is because I need more locations! free chips while waiting for food, and help your self salsa and condiment bar, and the food was plenty serving wise and good meat. Im craving some right now!"}
{"text":"So I didn't realize El Taco Tote was a chain. I had been passing by the place forever and figured it was a Mexican fast food joint. (As if we need another in Phoenix.)  But after having lunch there, I can say IMPRESSIVE. Not bad at all, folks.

On this particular day my tummy called for immediate attention, so I sprung into action and scouted out the choices on the W. 35th and Camelback intersection. Can't tell a lie. ETT is the best looking spot in the area. 

I originally asked for my grub to go. A baked potato, a couple of veggie empanadas, and a portion of cheesecake. Being a newbie - and a moron - I also requested for a small side of guacamole which the cashier promptly rang up at $2. She handed over a ticket-number stand with my change.

I sat at a table while the kitchen prepared food and got comfy. Hmmm, nice ambiance so I changed my mind to dine-in with the afternoon crowd. Wait, wha-? What? What's that in the middle of the restaurant? Is that a SALSA BAR ??

Oooh. Magical words. There were more than a dozen bins of fixin's at the bar. When I saw the $2 side of guac was the same mini serving cup from the bar I felt a little jooked. So word to the wise. Don't be a moron. Don't ask the cashier for sides, help yourself to refills of ample fixin's at the bar.

It's okay. I made up my loss by tasting everything there: pickled onions, chiles, veggies, etc, and each of the salsas. At the time, I saw no labels but the website gives the names of sauces: guacamole, cambray, pico de gallo, roja, verde, tatemada, chipotle. 

(The website also mentions a veggie mushroom taco, but I don't remember seeing that on the menu. I'll look again the next time I go.)

Anyway, the food:

- Baked potato was perfect. Medium size topped with butter and wrapped in foil.
- Pumpkin empanada was okay. Not too sweet but I would have preferred it warm. It worked better as part of the meal instead of as a dessert.
- Pineapple empanada was yucky. Overly sweet. Not real fruit.
- Cheesecake was okay. I think it was made with condensed milk, or with the same type of one of the milks used in tres leches cake.
- Salsa bar was fresh. Veggies were very spicy; especially the chiles. Pico de gallo was spicy too. One of the salsas I didn't like because it tasted like a hint of coffee.

ETT opens early and closes late night so if you're on the west side needing a quick bite to eat, def check out this spot. Worth it!"}
{"text":"NO, just no. The burritos are something like you'd get in your school cafeteria if the staff was white and new to cooking. Everything was overpriced, and I'm not one to not want to pay even if its quality. The place was so dirty and smelled like a stray dog or something."}
{"text":"Picture your average ----berto's but with a beer and a salsa bar.

No scratch that, at least those places put some effort into your food. Got the biggest burrito they had \"huge burrito? Buritto Tote? Something like that. Just barely warm. Adobado had decent flavoring but was masked by ample lettuce and cold, shredded cheddar. Recommended red salsa tasted like paprika and liquid smoke.

They have some groovy options here, no doubt. Their tortillas are obviously above average, but what goes inside of them is disappointing. If you have the patience to find out what does and doesn't work in lieu of a dozen options nearby, get at me and I'll reconsider."}
{"text":"Honestly kinda over priced for the meat you get on the price 
Kinda skimpy on the meat n not that flavorful for the price"}
{"text":"Real good basic Mexican food. Been to this location twice and the flagship in El Paso once. Always go with the same thing with satisfying results......the carne asada platter. The carne comes on a hot plate sizzling with temptation. Also has beans, rice and tortillas.  First off, my girlfriend and I told the cashier to hold the guacamole-we're both mildly allergic (a travesty, I know) and he offered to double our tortillas from five to ten. Hell yeah, we're off to a great start!  
     Next we were off to the salsa bar to load up on the extras-and there are plenty of em. About ten different varieties, along with marinated onions, jalapenos, guacamole, limes, cilantro, etc. Many great choices, along with a helpful explanation of each salsa, its heat level, and what meat it pairs best with. And before we could finish loading up our cornucopia of condiments the order was sizzling at the pickup counter.
     After about two more minutes of salsa selection, we're headed back to the table to a still crackling platter surrounded by two individual servings each of beans and rice. The carne asada was a perfect mix of crispy edges paired with tender chunks, atop a layer of marinated onions. The beans were whole, brown, and included the best mix-in of all-bacon! The rice was soft and fluffy, with a perfect smoky seasoning. Tortillas were good quality (we opted for flour), thin and flexible, but with the heft to hold all our stuffings in. All these ingredients made for a great make-your-own taco to be specified to one's own liking.  
    No real complaints about the food except for the serve yourself tortilla chips that were mostly broken and coldish.  Not much atmosphere, but the food is the star here. A game room with about ten video games is tucked away in the southeastern portion of the building to provide some entertainment for the kids if time is needed to settle that stomach. lol. Overall, a great value as the platter ($19.07 after tax) can feed two-three, and there are larger choices. We strive to come back and explore the rest of the menu, but memories of the sizzle have made it hard so far."}
{"text":"You ever drive around wanting some authentic Mexican food but everything seems so blah and pretty American?! Well Taco tote is the place to go for that homemade Mexican food! Fresh tortillas is the first sign it's authentic. They do have a fresh salas bar with chips!"}
{"text":"This is the second time here and it didn't disappoint. Took the family here today and they were impressed with the food. 

The food was delicious and tasty. I ordered the chicken burrito, shrimp taco and a fish taco. The burrito was full of flavor. The shrimp taco was outstanding and the fish taco surprised me to see just the fish and tortilla by itself. I thought it would have some cabbage and cream sauce on it, but nope. Not a bad thing, but it did surprised me. A few condiments later and it was gone like the rest.

Let's go to the amazing salsa bar! The avocado salsa was my favorite. There were a few more that I liked as well. This place knows how to make a good salsa.

The staff was very friendly and courteous. They did their best to keep the place clean and stocked.

Can't wait to go again......"}
{"text":"The best!!  Whats up with all the haters? This place is the best. I cant believe there are chumps across the parking lot throwing their money away at el pollo loco, when this gem is here. 

I got the adobaba and sirloin taco plate. So good and only 5 bucks!! Their horchata is amazing.  Salsa bar is awesome. Free chip refills. Great rice and beans. This has to be one of the best mexican restaurants in Mesa. 

The atmosphere is not 5 star, but who cares, this is about good authentic mexican food. I will be back again...and again.... and again...."}
{"text":"My favorite!! Try the Barbacoa tacos with corn tortillas. It will change your religion. I'm sad they don't have the Mesa location any more."}
{"text":"Brightly lit and clean. Good selection but I think they are too pricey for what you get.
I had 2 taco combo with rice and beans. One taco was barbacoa and the other was adobaba(sp?) chicken. The chicken was absolutely awesome....the barbacoa, not so much. The meat looked like a turd. Sorry but that's just what it looked like and the flavor was not there.
The salsa bar and all you can eat chips is great. I loved the salsa verde and the avocado salsas. My GF and daughter both loved the pico. 
So I may be back if I'm in the area but still think they need to check their pricing."}
{"text":"The food is good but I feel a lil pricey for what you get. Portions are big but its almost like a fast food quality. Tacos are BOMB! but again $4.99 for a taco"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  Tortillas made fresh, great high quality grilled meats and overall very high quality food.  You must try there Barbacoa tacos it is the most delicious meat I don't  know how they make it but it is ridiculously good and satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is so overpriced for what you get I paid 30 dollars for a pound of half chicken half steak now that's bullshit I can make more for half the cost at home honestly The food is literally flavorless the beans are nasty the rice is plain and the customer service really F**king sucks the cashier is so slow as well it took her about 5 minutes to give change to the person in front of me then she took my order she didn't answer any of my questions and after that just kept talking to her co worker while people were waiting in line . The place was a mess for how many people where working at the time as well the bathrooms looked like a tornado had gone off in there water/piss was all over the floor not sure what it was but damn smh. This place has really gone downhill I don't think I'll be coming back much less recommending people to come here."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican \"fast food\". Salsa is flavorful and spicy. Handmade tortillas are served fresh and hot. Best tacos in town. Definitely worth the drive and open late!"}
{"text":"The only good thing this restaurant has going on is the salsa bar but besides that everything sucks the food, the service, the price... Super over priced for mexican food and the meats are not cooked well or even seasoned it's not real mexican food... Will not ever go back"}
{"text":"This place pumps out tacos as fast as Mcdonald's does hamburgers. It's a site to see if nothing else. The tacos are tasty, the salsa bar has plenty of options, and their soda fountain has a lot of choices. They let you pretty much design your own tacos from several different types of meats and salsas. I like the concept, and they execute it well. 

It's not kept very clean, and you might have to clean your own table. It's always over run with kids, but if you are looking for a quick taco on the westside, it's a pretty decent bet."}
{"text":"The food was very good and very hot! The tortillas were warm and wrapped in aluminum to keep in the heat which was very smart. I got the Barbacoa meat which was very flavorful and marinated well. It was about 30$ and can last you a while depending on how much meat you put in the tacos. There is a large array of topping and salsas at the bar which was very nice and kept adding more flavor to your tacos. Overall we had a good experience in the Tucson location and the Phoenix location"}
{"text":"I been passing this place so many times and I finally got the chance stop by. And let me tell you this place is delicious. My sister of mine had been telling me about this place.  We live about 10 min away.  I stop and visiting my sister and ask lets do lunch El Taco Tote.  It is the first thing I saw on the menu, cause I'm a sucker for street tacos so I had the Tripitas .  It is the first thing I saw on the menu. And my wife and sister had the Carne Asada Taco plates. These  Tortillas are made fresh, great high quality grilled meats and overall very high quality food. Yes, salsa bar is great. I love that they have cilantro and onions separate. They even have cucumber slices and your different kinds of salsa. This could be my new hole in the wall. Will be back to try some other menu items.... can't wait come back"}
{"text":"My wife and I popped in before heading over to the remodeled Bookmans.

What was the first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant, you ask?

Well, it was the woman in the back, hand pressing fresh tortillas.  Oh yeah baby.  I'm loving it.

Another thing I loved was the all you can eat chips & salsa bar.  Yeah, its a bar, well, more of an island style service tray with sneeze-guard.

But as in life, all good things must come to an end.  My adobaba tacos had a few too many fatty pieces inside.  So, I'm not loving it so much anymore.

But I'll return to try the steak or chicken."}
{"text":"You can smell of the sizzling fajitas from outside of the restaurant.  I have stopped by around 12PM expecting a very long line, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I had ordered 1 pound of top sirloin and 1 pound of beef fajitas.  I figured that might not be enough to feed 4, so added a super quesadillas.   The fajitas were juicy, savory, and accompanied with handmade tortillas.  They have a pretty impressive salsa bar.   A huge selection of flavorful salsa's range of spice levels, fresh guacamole, large jalapenos, and salted fishes.  The chips were very good, freshly made and warm.   I had waited at least 25 minutes before getting my order.  I definitly will call ahead next time."}
{"text":"El Taco Tote
35th Ave & Camelback
Cost: $3.5
Service: 1 of 5, I couldn't understand the order person, took me 4 minutes to order a beer while one of the staff just looked at me. Actually gave us the wrong tacos.
Presentation: 4 of 5, can put on your own toppings, and some of the tacos are big, and some are small, we couldn't tell the difference in how to order the big ones since we got the wrong ones on 2 of 3 orders. 
Taste: 5 of 5, great taste and fresh. If the service wasn't bad I'd go back."}
{"text":"It was VERY busy, so it took awhile to even order, but it was crazy delicious! The tortillas were to die for. It was cool to watch them make them. I LOVED the rice!"}
{"text":"Came back today to try this place out again.  Was craving some chips and tortillas so I came down.  Unfortunately, it will probably be my last time :-(.  I appreciate the follow up comment by the manager, but this place just isn't for me.  

I ordered a chicken adobada taco and a regular grilled chicken taco.  That, a small drink and 3 corn tortillas was almost $12 bucks!  That is one reason I won't be coming back.  Its way way way too expensive for what you get.  The chicken was decent.  The adobada was pretty flavorful and the grilled chicken was alright.  Skimp though.  $3.39 for ONE taco.  The flour tortillas were good.  Not as good as last time but still homemade and good.  My side order of corn tortillas were just ok.  Free chips and fixings were decent.  The place was pretty much empty yet it still took a good 10 minutes for my food to come out.  Meh....not the worst meal ever but far from great and nothing from this visit improved upon my first time there.  I highly doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"This has been on my list of places to try for a while now since it is so close to school. Finally decided to try it last night with a friend of mine. She got two carne assda tacos on corn tortillas, I got the supreme quesadilla, and a bean and cheese burrito for my boyfriend. My friend thought the tacos were delicious and I absolutely loved the quesadilla which came with some guacamole on the side. The bean and cheese burrito was pretty big, and was also enjoyed. All this food was only $18-19. They also have a deal for 6 flour tortilla tacos for $5.50."}
{"text":"My favorite dish year is the brochette burritos - the price is a great and quantity of food is great also"}
{"text":"Yum.  My new favorite Taco Shop.
Awesome salsa bar.
Several people dedicated to making fresh tortillas.
All sorts of beef, chicken, pork and *other* meat."}
{"text":"Came here because we were craving tacos for taco Tuesday (which by the way it's weird to me that a Mexican restaurant doesn't have a taco Tuesday special which they don't) and saw if you checked in on yelp you get a free bean and cheese taco. Well when we went to redeem it at the front the employee was kind rude about us wanting to use it- and we had to buy a 2.50 drink which was kinda expensive for a fountain drink. The inside was nicer than we thought and they do have a full salsa bar with chips. My boyfriend LOVED their guacamole salsa- but after feeling so embarrassed about using a coupon- it kind of threw of my experience here. Can't say much about the food because we didn't order anything else besides the free taco once the guy was rude to us about it... but the green guacamole salsa was good- and the environment was better than we expected."}
{"text":"Love love love! 
So stinkin delicious.. tortillas, salsa bar, barbacoa, and yummy pineapple empenadas .... 
Looks a tad sketchy on the outside but inside is clean, staff is friendly, and unlimited chips and salsa.... what more do you need?... 
Oh! And they give a discount if you have a GCU ID!"}
{"text":"The locals like this place and so do I.  Tortillas made right in front of you and the menu is full of pics in case you don't know what something is.  Couple of good salsas too at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday expecting this place to have some sort of Taco Tuesday deal, but was sadly mistaken. I was drawn in by the yelp coupon offer of a \"free bean and cheese taco w drink\" when you check in, but felt a little deceived that the offer didn't say \"with the purchase of a drink\". The one thing I did like about this place was the unlimited chips and salsa bar! That guacamole salsa was freakin muy delicioso and the chips really satisfied my craving! Maybe someday I'll give this place another go, but for right now I'd rather find somewhere else to get my Taco Tuesday fix. 5/10"}
{"text":"This place is in the neighborhood and I wondered about it. I never thought I would go in a million years. I stopped by tonight because I just missed Subway's door closing. Granted, I did not order much and maybe 10pm on a Sunday night of a holiday weekend was not the best time for them. All I can say is, \"Yuk!\" The place was disgustingly dirty. 

   The Chicken Quesadilla and Pineapple Empanada that I received were beyond disgusting. (and I rarely say that about food) The Quesadilla had hardly no cheese on it or maybe none at all. I opened it up to look at it thinking they gave me the wrong order because it did not even look like a Quesadilla. It was very thick and lumpy. Not cooked enough maybe? The Empanada tasted more like a week old donut. It was hard, and stale. 

   The Salsa Bar was like a Pollo Asada. It had a lot of variety but it was so dirty. Also, none of the sauces had anything special going for them. They did not have any flavor or consistency. One was like water. Ewhhh! I guess people rave about their Carne Asada but I will stick to Gallo Blanco.

   I hope I don't get food poisoning. I have to say something positive so I will say the girl who was working the counter was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love how fast past the place is yet the meet is not grilled until ordered (from what I saw). They have a very awesome implemented system of work that allows ven to work fast and efficient. 
They have a Large Chip dispenser and you can have all the chips your heart desires BUT they are a bit stale because they are exposed to the air. I love that they have a condiment and salsa bar so you can serve yourself all the salsa and taco condiments you need! The green salsa isn't that good, their guacamole salsa is pretty good, and the grilled chilis (although cold) taste really good. The meat was nice and juicy which I appreciate. Needs a little More flavor but definitely grilled fresh to order which I love! The tortillas were good too. They are warmed on the grill as you order."}
