{"text":"This is my fav place in the north hills to eat. Love everything I've ever tried. Anyone who post anything negative can eat somewhere else cause it's just more seating for me and my friends."}
{"text":"everything we have tried has been delicious!  Salads, soups, sandwiches!  The staff are friendly and attentive (ie they brought out my 2 year olds kids meal first). I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish the sandwiches came with a side.  I also wish the kids menu was a little better-  it often defers us from eating here because the \"kids menu\" is pretty weak-  peanut butter and jelly or grilled cheese really."}
{"text":"Had a special of the day sandwich and the house salad - both were excellent, service was quick, friendly, and professional. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Zuppa's Deli has the WOW factor!!! Soups, sides, sandwiches & more are always amazing!  Customer service is part of the package with a clean & comfortable environment!  Best delicatessen around! Cheers to Zuppa's!"}
{"text":"This is a clean, cute but small deli located right off of 19 in Wexford in a plaza.  It works just like Panera, you order upfront and wait for your food. However, they bring your food to your table which is nice.  I got the \"pick two\" combo including tomato bisque soup and a turkey avocado wrap. Together it came to about $9.  I'll start with the soup- if you are a tomato bisque fan- it's a must try! They sprinkle croutons and a small, thin slice of cheese on top and its amazing! It has that kick of spice, so good!  As for the wrap, it was okay. It was satisfying but lacked some flavor. I could really only taste the small pieces of corn they included in the wrap. The piece of avocado was way at the bottom of the wrap and from what I could taste, that was about it. However, it's a small fix and definitely didn't push me away from coming back for lunch!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered. The rubin omg can you say out of this world. . i was surprised at the flavor of this amazing sandwich will return ty great"}
{"text":"Best deli around. Hands down. Sandwiches are amazing, soups are amazing, salads are amazing. Quick friendly service every single time I've been there. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Introduced to Zuppas at A Taste of North Allegheny and was anxious to see if their fare lived up to the quality samples served.  They delivered!...The soups ( minestrone, corn shrimp chowder, tomato bisque) were tasty and the sandwiches (Italian sub, rubenator) were excellent & large enough to split.    Many others obviously share my opinion as it was busy....and for good reason"}
{"text":"Just discovered Zuppa's and now it is a regular weekly dinner and/or lunch retreat!  Bruschetta Chicken Salad - DAYUM - it tastes so good, one forgets that it is healthy!  Mad at myself for not stopping sooner!  Typically eat-in for lunch and take-out for dinner.  Great soups and healthy eats (that all taste good) - Happy to have you near the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, tasty, and consistently good.  Menu is great for adults and my kids love the mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  I had the meatloaf panini...was very good and the wedding soup was tasty! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed Zuppa's yet.  This place is great.  Zuppa's is owned/operated by 3 former employee's of Bravo.  It is a sitdown/takeout deli with plenty of seating.  The food is fantastic!  Basically soup/sandwich fare.  Try the prime rib panini (yum yum) and a cannoli.  Everything is freshly prepared.  The emphasis appears to be on the details."}
{"text":"Been going to Zuppas since they opened June 2010. I can truly say I have NEVER had a bad meal. I love the menu: soups, salads, sandwiches. The Deviled Eggs and  Baked Beans are fantastic!   The atmosphere is a step up from usual \"deli\" style decor.   \"The guys\" as I call them, Rich, Mike and Rob have their hearts in the right place. Fresh ingredients, interesting menu options without being obscure, and consistency.  They always ask how your meal was and are open to suggestions.   My only regret is that is that my daughter doesn't go to school near Zuppas any longer and I miss grabbing a bite to eat as often as I used to.  Make sure you sign up for frequent customer rewards. No need to keep track of a card. When you order, give them your name and they will automatically add your purchase toward your rewards: Free soup and/or $10.00 of your next meal purchase."}
{"text":"Sandwich was amazing. Basically this place is an upscale Panera, with real chefs for a cheaper cost. One of new favorite places."}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't absolutely love here. I will probably never eat any other item they have because I just got done eating the fish tacos... they are hands down the best fish tacos I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot and one of my go to's when taking someone out who has never been.  Zuppa's is an upscale Panera.  Panera used to be the \"in place\" now it is Zuppa's.  They have the most amazing and creative menu and I have not had anything that I didn't like here.   I always get the Meatloaf Sandwich on the Pick 2 menu. The meatloaf sandwich consists of meatloaf, bacon, bbq sauce and mashed potatoes.  Then I also get a salad as my side.  I have also had the tomato bisque soup along with the cream of mushroom soup which are both good.    The only downside is the small location but I have heard rumors of a second location and can only hope those rumors are true!!!"}
{"text":"Zuppa's is one of my favorite lunch spots in Wexford! It's a similar concept to panera but SO  much better. You walk in and all the food is listed on a chalkboard. There are probably about 15 tables if you want to eat there. The people who work here are very friendly and will remember you after you've been a few times. You can't go wrong with any of the food here but my absolute favorite is the spicy shrimp and corn chowder, you must try it!!"}
{"text":"They have fantastic food!!!!!  We have been eating here for years.  Veggie Sammy is incredible with wonderful sauce with a bit of a kick that really makes it!  Great pulled pork.  Great tomato soup.  Awesome mac and cheese.  We have had catering done from them as well several times.  Everyone always loves it.  My husband loves the rueben.  You cannot go wrong here with any menu item.  The food is very high quality and fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and soups! My favorite thing to get is the minestrone soup. Owners and staff are professional and friendly. :) I just wish that they were open on Sunday because somehow they keep coming to mind for Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"I've not read all the reviews for Zuppa's Deli, but I definitely seem to be in the minority giving a 3-star rating for this eatery. It is a pleasant restaurant with polite and welcoming staff. My rating is solely based on the flavor of the food items I ordered.   I decided on the Pick Two and selected their Tomato Bisque soup and Caesar Salad. The soup looked delicious, but it was way too tangy. It would have been absolutely delicious if the overpowering tomato flavor had been tamed with some melted cream cheese to make it smoother on the tongue. Similarly, the Caesar salad I ordered smarted with an abundance of vinegar, which I found bewildering. I suppose I'm used to creamier dressing than what this eatery had to offer. It did not taste horrible, but it was not as rich as I'd like. Finally, while they have Pepsi products, they do not carry the Pepsi root beer line called Mug Root Beer. Instead, they have a root beer from Stubborn Soda. I found this root beer to have an undesirable aftertaste.   Because of these reasons, I can only give this eatery a three star rating. It is, in no way, a bad place to eat. I would go there again, but would definitely not order these items again."}
{"text":"The past two visits my husband and I made to this spot have been fantastic. We're sorry we don't live closer to Wexford because of how good it is. Although maybe that's a good thing, because the two of us don't need to get any fatter than we already are.  The food is wonderful. They have many different options; I'm sure even the pickiest eaters could find something they liked. They do made-to-order sandwiches too, if you're a rebel that lives to your own sandwichy tune. Each meal tastes like serious time and effort has gone into it.    They have a great Pick Two lunch option that give you two choices of a half sandwich, cup of soup, side salad, or side dish. I liked the addition of a side dish option, because sometimes, darn it, I want cole slaw. Try the Mac N Cheese. Do it. Unless you're lactose intolerant. Then don't.  The staff is friendly and attentive. I like that they bring your food out to you rather than calling your name in an annoyed voice or thrusting a pager at you.   TL;DR: Food is awesome, great Pick Two option, nice people. Spend some money there so they stick around and I get to keep sabotaging my diet."}
{"text":"I just left there 10 minutes ago, ate my first spoonful of the stuffed pepper soup... Lord have mercy. I had to post a review. This is amazing. It's one of the daily soups today so do yourself a favor. Besides immediately loving the soup the man at the counter was so nice, let me know that everything is homemade without any GMO's and all that other nasty shit. I haven't tried the roasted chicken panini yet but even if it's terrible (highly doubt) this soup is the beez neez. Will def try other menu options in the future."}
{"text":"I have been here two times with my husband and it has not disappointed either of us. Zuppa's is a quaint deli with the menu displayed on the wall as soon as one walks in the door. There are a variety of options, ranging from different soups and salads to paninis and sandwiches. They offer a half cup of soup or salad with a half of a sandwich or panini for anyone who may be interested in trying more than one item on the menu. I have chosen this option both times and could not be more pleased!  Items from the menu that  I have tried include the Zuppaletta Panini, Italian Club Signature Sandwich, a Caesar Salad and Italian Wedding Soup. The panini and sandwich both had a warm component to them which I really enjoyed. Zuppa put their own twist on the Caesar Salad, adding Asiago crisps and toasted baguette along with the romaine lettuce, making for a very pleasing bite. Finally, the Italian Wedding Soup contained orzo instead of the typical acini de pepe, which added more substance to the soup. All ingredients were fresh and on point!   I recommend Zuppa not only for their food, but for their service. Everyone we have encountered has been very pleasant, even later in the evening. We ordered take out and it was prepared right in front of us within 5 minutes. Even when they answer the phone, they have a pleasant tone in their voices as if they thoroughly enjoy their jobs. It was obvious who the regular customers are as the employees would call them by name when they walked in the door, asking if they want \"the usual\". I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious. Zuppa's Deli always has a clean and friendly atmosphere. Their food is cooked to perfection & ready in a time efficient manner. They always have kind employees which makes the atmosphere even better. They offer many options with mixing & matching meals. Their menu is one of a kind. 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Great alternative to the chains, zuppa's offers a pick two so you can get a half sandwhich with a soup, side or salad.  Everything we've gotten has been great and price is reasonable.  Watch out for eating in during a karate class, when they're breaking boards, you hear it.  Staff are friendly and make everything to order."}
{"text":"Is it me or does everybody have trouble finding something to eat at the hot food section of Whole Foods? Okay, I get it: sometimes people want  alternatives such as vegetarian, et cetera. But tofu tikka masala? Really? It's lunch time on a cold day. All I want is a little really good pot roast and some corn bread. Is that too much to ask? Okay, so a friend told me about Zuppa's delicatessen . On a whim, I tried it on a cold Saturday afternoon. Ordered the half a panini with a salad / house dressing. First of all, you are cordially greeted when you walk through the door. Second, the place is neat enough to eat off the floor. Third, the food, which comes in enormous portions, is well prepared and appears to be of the freshest ingredients. All in all, for cleanliness, Congeniality,  quality of food, and price, I give this a five star. PS- the portions could be halved and still be satisfying. I'd probably share that meal next time. When I want really good tikka masala, I will go to the Star of India and I will get the real thing. In the meantime, its Zuppas delicatessen for lunch. Just saying."}
{"text":"This place is a slice of heaven in a town of chain restaurants! My Italian club sandwich on toasted Italian bread had to be the tallest most ingredient filled club sandwich I've ever had! So fresh and delicious. Nice sit down eat in area or you can sit outside at two person tables. The house salad was crisp and again not lacking in toppings! I loved it!"}
{"text":"I recently had the chance to try Zuppa's when I got lunch with a friend, and have to say I was fairly pleased with my meal here. It's basically the local version of Panera, but without the bakery - which is not necessarily a bad thing, considering how bad for me that bakery at Panera is...  My friend and I both had a Pick-2 Combo when we ordered; I opted for wedding soup and a panini, and he a chicken sandwich and mac and cheese. I actually kind of wish I'd ordered the mac and cheese, because it looked very, very good - not to speak badly about my own soup, which was pretty darn good though lacking in a few extra meatballs which would have made the mix perfect. But then, I'll forgive even this considering that I love a good tomato and mozzarella panini, which is exactly what I got.  Keeping with the Panera comparison, while the sandwich and side options are absolutely delicious, don't expect to have a lot in terms of drink options: water, diet soda, or super sugary teas and regular sodas are all you get, which was a little disappointing. I even debated driving down the road afterward to go to Panera and get a giant cup of hot tea - the non-sugary kind. Also, seating here is fairly limited if you're looking for an actual table, so be prepared to sit on a stool at a high table if need be - that's what happened to my friend and I.  If I'm in the area or someone asks for a Wexford recommendation, Zuppa's will definitely get it - I may recommend getting a drink elsewhere beforehand, though."}
{"text":"Great place!  Went there for lunch this past week and got a 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.  It sandwich ended up being a whole pulled pork sandwich, which was big and delicious.  Why go to Panera when this place is here?"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and amazing food. Definitely coming back. The corn & shrimp chowder was amazing as was the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. I'll be spending much less time at Paneras and much more at Zuppa's Deli"}
{"text":"Zuppa's Deli is a great place to meet a friend for lunch.  I get the Panera comparison that many people have brought up, but I think reviewers just go there because you can pick two items (salad and soup, half sandwich and salad, etc) at Zuppa's like you can at Panera.  Other than this ordering option, I'd never compare Zuppa's to anything else.    When you first walk in, the menu is written on the wall just to your left.  There's a lot to take in on your first trip and the line gets long pretty quickly during lunch hour.  I felt the pressure in trying to decide that first time for sure.  But the friendly greetings from the staff help calm me down and narrow my choices.  The counter where food is prepared is not very big but they bust out the orders in an organized fashion.  Food is prepped, plated and brought to your table before you know it.    I've tried a few of the sandwiches including the Meatloaf Panini, Tomato and Basil Panini and the Little Italy sandwich.  Having enjoyed them all greatly, I don't think Zuppa's makes a bad sandwich.  I've also tried the Caesar salad.  But my favorite menu item, hands down, by far is the Chicken Brushetta Salad.  The chicken is so beautifully cooked and sitting like a cloud on top of the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese.  It sounds simple enough but it's so wonderfully executed I've yet to taste its equal.  I can't speak for the sides or soups but I don't see how any of their soups or sides could disappoint based on how amazing everything else is.  I've been back a few times and it's my go-to when someone asks to meet for lunch in the Wexford area."}
{"text":"Zuppa's is head and shoulders above Panera.  The only thing they have in common is they serve salads, soups, and sandwiches.  Pick two?  So many restaurants offer the soup and/or salad and/or sandwich combo.  Zuppa's serves fresh homemade soups with more offerings than Panera including two daily specials.  They are made on the premises.  Not premade at a plant and poured into a serving canteen like Panera.  Delicious salads and sandwiches.  Interesting sides such as mac and cheese and baked beans.  And the daily cannolies....!!!  I took my daughter there today.  She had a bowl of minestrone and I had the spicy shrimp and corn chowder.  We shared an eggplant parmesan panini.  She was impressed!  Portions are a nice size compared to Panera with its ever shrinking soup bowl.  Does anyone remember the size of a soup bowl when Panera first opened?!  And Zuppa's is NOT more expensive than Panera.    What would I change?  Location.  Getting in and out of the crowded small lot can be annoying and dangerous.  Also, a better layout of the dining area.  There are two separate doorways in which you can enter.  Many tables are right smack in front of these doors.  During this time of the year, it's cold in the dining area.  There are only a few tables tucked in the back.  Could be a little cozier."}
{"text":"This is my new lunch place! Food is solid  and the service is quick. My favorite item there is the Italian wedding soup along with the Little Italy and Italian sausage sandwiches. My boyfriend has had their Nutella and Chocolate cannolis and he has said those were pretty good. Anyways, this lunch is right across the street from where I work so I'm probably going to continue to be the Duchess of this place until the project is over and I'm no longer working in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"They have a nice menu, but it is kind of pricey. I ordered the salmon salad for lunch. It was a beautiful salad! But the salmon was cold and uncooked.  The outside was just cooked a little. I'm not one to send food back. Very disappointing. The cashier could use a smile."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I was working in the area and didn't want to eat at a \"chain\" restaurant. The service was excellent. The guys were polite and quick! I ordered the chicken salad and wow was it good! The cook even came out and asked me how my salad was! The line was to the door, and they had everyone's order in and out within ten minutes. I'll be coming back the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Yelp introduced me to Zuppa's Deli.  Loved this place and am so glad we gave it a try last week.  I ordered The Little Italy Specialty Sandwich composed of \"Prosciutto di Parma, Fresh Mozzarella, Cracked Black Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, arugula and a fig spread on toasted Italian Bread.\"  Good but not phenomenal.  I wish the The Little Italy were a panini rather than a sandwich, though I'm biased because I love panini!  The combination of the sweet fig spread and the bitter arugula really made the flavors pop, but for me the sandwich wasn't quite moist enough.  My boyfriend's Zuppaleta Panini (\"Pastrami and Honey Ham with olive Tapenade, sweet basil dressing and shaved parmesan\") was fantastic.  Loaded with meat and liquidity and flavor.  Zuppa's, from my experience, is an impeccably clean casual little plaza deli with table and booth seating options.  You pay at the counter, and then your order's brought out when it's ready.  We received very friendly and efficient service from The Big Guy--you'll know him when you see him.  Really nice gentleman.  I'd return to Zuppa's Deli in a heartbeat, and you should check it out too if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice now and have absolutely loved it.  Zuppa's reminds me of a Panera Bread, but with much better food! I went here for lunch with my wife today and noticed a steady stream of customers coming in, some of who were obvious regulars.  The building itself is rather small with a few decorations and unfortunately can be easily missed as you drive on route 19.  My wife and I both ordered the pick two off the menu.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and shrimp and corn chowder soup.  My wife ordered the Zuppaletta sandwich and a caesar salad. The pulled pork had a nice sweet tanginess to it and the soup had a wonderful smooth creamy texture.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Everything was freshly prepared and came in very reasonable proportions.  Zuppa's does a great job with soup, salad, and sandwiches.  They are a fantastic place for a nice lunch and have a nice variety of different selections.  We will for sure be back try out some more of their menu options!"}
{"text":"Feeling VERY lucky to have stumbled upon  Zuppa's Deli in the Wexford Flats.  Making my way thru the menu on a weekly basis - but I have to go twice per week just to get my fix of the roast beef panini."}
{"text":"Insalata Toscana! I usually do a combo with this salad. Today I added chicken to the side salad for a healthy option. The staff is friendly. Their service is great. I like this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"This whole plaza is filled with surprises. I have been getting my hair done at the salon next door since moving from Las Vegas. The owner/my stylist has recommended this place day one. It was delicious! I'm sad it took me so long to try it.  I had the 1/2 Reubenator sand and Mac n cheese side. The portion was perfect. It was grilled just right, corned beef tasted great with the right amount of sauerkraut and sauce oozing out the side. The Mac n cheese had larger noodles and very cheesy.  I finished the meal with the BEST homemade peanut butter cannoli I've ever had! For a small delicatessen, the ambiance was just right, the service was friendly and quick...the food was really good. Can't wait to go back and try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf sandwich is so good! I always get a bowl a soup. If I could change anything about this place it would be the strip mall location. They deserve so much better like a castle!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Zuppas. Perfect comfort foods. The spicy shrimp corn bisque is amazing. Exactly what I want on a cold, dreary day. Their salads are always amazing, we've never had a bad meal here. You can eat in, they have a few tables, or take your food home to eat. The service is always very friendly and happy to help however they can. I wish they had a location closer to us!"}
{"text":"The two guys that run this do a real solid job.  One of the better if not the best deli's north of the city."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It's a nice little cafe/deli; clean, simple and quiet. I ordered a roasted chicken panini and chili, which was the soup of the day. Both were excellent. The sammich was crisp on the outside, juicy in the middle and had great flavor. The chili had a little heat, which is awesome. Most restaurant chili requires you to add the heat, but this was cooked in.   The bill came to $10+, but I don't mind paying for quality. I'd rather spend $10 here than $8 at fast food."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had a 1/2 sandwich and soup. I love loafers but this is def some competition.  They have a nice large menu to choose from and everything tasted so fresh."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST!!!!  Quality food and service!  You won't regret ordering anything here ever!"}
{"text":"Their meatloaf panini makes my mouth water...it is absolutely delicious. Order it every time but the other items are their menu look just as mouth watering. Mac and cheese is creamy and delicious as well. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has the best homemade tomato soup I've ever tasted. Nothing like that Campbell's crap, proper authentic thick tomato soap. Sandwiches are big and well prepared. It's more of an artisan style deli verses your New York Philadelphia street deli. Recommended."}
{"text":"Finally got back here again (I don't live super close), and was maybe even more impressed this time. Hot tip: BEANS AND GREENS ARE PHENOMENAL. I say this largely because I don't feel like many people would gravitate toward that without a recommendation. But they are AMAZING. So flavorful."}
{"text":"What a fantastic deli! Their menu is huge and diverse. I went with a group of five adults and one child. We all got something different: ranging from soup and salad to hot and cold sandwiches to mac and cheese to deviled eggs. And the pickles are fresh and crispy! (There's *nothing* worse than a bland, wiggly pickle - coughcough, I'm talking to YOU Panera). Our total bill was only $52 - which is much cheaper than going somewhere comparable (again, way better food at a much lower price versus what you could expect at Panera). Now that I've discovered Zuppa's closer to home at the Harmarville location, I won't go anywhere else for a comfort food deli meal. Yay!"}
{"text":"I have stopped by this establishment a couple times now for lunch.  Parking is not a problem and counter service is very friendly and they have just enough seating.  On my first visit, I got the 1/2 sandwich with soup.  My chicken salad sandwich was very meaty and had good flavor with the grapes and pine nuts.  I really enjoyed it.  I first ordered the wedding soup, but while waiting for my order, I noticed the Spicy Shrimp and Corn chowder.  OMG, I had to have it!  The soup is very heavy with cream, I wished it was a titch lighter.  But still, I loved it.    Next visit was not so hot.  I ordered the Shrimp and Spinach salad.  The salad is described as \"slightly wilted spinach\".  My spinach wasn't slightly, it was totally and completely.  Every single leaf.  Mangled and maimed.  Very sad spinach.  The shrimp was fairly good.  Loved the tri-colored peppers and red onions.  But the bacon in the vinaigrette dressing was pretty much raw.  So, the condition of the spinach and the bacon totally ruined the salad.  I was very sad!!    Had I written by review after my first visit, Zuppa's would have had 5 stars.  I'm not feeling so great about them after my second visit."}
{"text":"I made the QUICK stop after having an amazing meal up the street, just to order a CANNOLI.   Saw a review on YELP.   First time there, My husband and I live an hour away.  I found out they do a different favor everyday...today was BUTTERSCOTCH!!  DELICIOUS...Period.  I cannot wait to go back and get a sandwich, soup and a CANNOLI."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law took us here for lunch, and we loved it! It looks like a small, non-description little strip mall spot, but the sandwiches and soups are top notch! The menu was full of creative and uncommon options, including amazing specials.  Skip the chains like Panera and eat locally here at Zuppa's. We will definitely ask to go back when we are visiting again.  There's also a craft soda fountain to boot.  Keep in mind there could be a crowd at lunch, so you might have to wait for a seat. Worth it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great lunch this is a good place to stop.  My mom and I made a quick stop here, and couldnt'have been happier.  I had the macaroni and cheese, and the tomato basil mozzerella sandwich.  Everything was prepared fresh, and tasted great."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for lunch at the office! Zuppa's is the cure for the all of those boring chain soup/sandwich places. Their sandwich menu is creative and everything is delicious.   My two favorites are the Meatloaf Sandwich  and the Little Italy. The meatloaf sandwich is a meal in itself piled with meatloaf, bacon, bbq sauce and mashed potatoes - it makes me hungry just thinking about it! The Little Italy is Italian bread, prosciutto, fig spread, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and field greens.   They have a several homemade soups on the menu (tomato bisque, shrimp and corn chowder, minnestrone) but also have two daily soups that range from anything from cream of mushroom to Guinness stew.  Don't forget the homemade cannoli! The flavors change daily too. So far I've had vanilla, pistachio, pumpkin, and peanut butter."}
{"text":"Zuppa's is such a delight! Not only is their food fresh and delicious, the staff is very friendly. You must try the tuna and chicken salads, wedding soup, oh and the deviled eggs! The best deli around! We love Zuppas!"}
{"text":"Zuppa's is amazing. To me - it is a must stop inthe North Hills.  Soups, salads, sandwiches....all spectacular!  Seasonal specials are divine!!  Owners are hands on and the place is always well staffed and well cared for... Great people and great food!!"}
