{"text":"The sushi is great--tastes fresh and is prepared quickly.  Don't order their noodles, however.  One night I had a hankering for beef udon, so I called in an order and ran to pick it up.  I had to re-season the broth myself it had absolutely no flavor.  But that's ok because their sushi is still worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty Salmon Teriyaki.  Nice Sushi Just the reg mixed salad - a bit disappointing... But overall pretty good..."}
{"text":"I ate here a lot when I worked in the area. Probably twice a week over a course of two years. The service was quick and the food was pretty good, especially the spicy salmon rolls. It was really my go to sushi joint for lunch. Haven't eaten here in a few years so I decided to get delivery. Not sure what happen to this place but both the food and service was horrible. Delivery took 80 mins and the food was cold, like I took it out of the fridge and allowed it to warm up to room temperature cold. I pretty much had to microwave the whole delivery. The yakisoba noodles and beef w/ enoki mushrooms were greasy and bland. There was nothin teriyaki about the spicy chicken teriyaki, tasted like sweet and sour chicken. White rice was undercooked. These four items tasted like it came from a bad chinese food court resto. Also had three makis. Pretty much tasted like nothing but a ball of pasty. Not even a hint of spicy in the spicy salmon roll. So disappointing and would never eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is okay--not great but not terrible.  In other words the rolls are fine, but I wouldn't go here for sashimi.  I've been to this place a couple of times.  For downtown the prices are average and food is okay.  The first time I went the wait was short; the second time we went on a Friday (after 8:30pm) and it literally took 40 minutes to get a bunch of rolls."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at Varsity, we were looking for a dinner place that was quick, but good. After doing a quick search using the Yelp monocle on my iPhone (the Yelp app is seriously the BOMB), we ran across Sushi Club. The reviews were good, so off we went.  Located near the corner of Bay and Charles streets, Sushi Club is nothing if not warm and cozy. It wasn't overly crowded, but had enough people that made it feel like it was going to satisfy. The restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly enough. But really, who goes to a sushi restaurant for cleanliness or friendliness? Not I. So let's get to the food.  The menu is large, but typical of a sushi place. And then I saw the prices whereby my eyes almost popped out of my head. Literally, this was the most reasonably priced (by which I mean CHEAP!) place I'd ever seen in Toronto. It harkened me back to my Houston days where you could actually eat out under $20. The rolls at Sushi Club are eight pieces and I ordered the Gold Dragon Roll (shrimp tempura, tobiko and salmon) which was $7.95!! The California Roll was $5.50, as was most of the other rolls. The test would be the taste and all I can say is holy goodness, Batman! It was delish! The temperature of the sushi was good and the fish was fresh. They served ample wasabi and ginger, too. Add in my Diet Coke and I was only out $10.68. W00T!!  In parting, all I can say is \"long live Sushi Club\"!"}
{"text":"Last weekend we decided to try this new sushi place called Sushi Club. The atmosphere seems nice, it's modern clean and decorated with several flat screens throughout the restaurant.  They offer all you can eat sushi for only $19.95 which is a great deal if you compare other places like Sushimon or Wonder Sushi. However, after looking at the all you can eat offerings, you realize that there is only sushi, hand rolls and rolls in the available list. No appetizers, no desserts, no side dishes.  It would have been fine if the sushi were great, however, they were not. We practically ordered every sushi in the menu and most were not that great. In many of them, the rice was excessive and the fish was not that fresh. They had amaebi (sweet shrimp) in the menu, but when it arrived, it turned out to be normal cooked shrimp!   There were about 4 sushi chefs there and I think only 1 was Asian, while there rest were \"amigos'. Needless to say, we were disappointed. For $26, you could go to nearby Sushimon which offer much better selection and more items, including appetizers, desserts and side dishes. Or, if you really want good sushi, try Osaka located in the next shopping center."}
{"text":"We ordered a Salmon Don but what we are served is nothing like the Salmon Don on their manual.  The sushi rice and several pieces of salmon are placed on a ugly plate in a very bad shape. Basically, what we got is a Chinatown lunch special. I bet the chef didn't spend more than one minute to the presentation. Will NEVER try again/"}
{"text":"I come here with a friend maybe once a month. Not a huge fan of sushi, so I usually get the excellent miso or tonkotsu romen with chicken. Large portions, generous with meat and comes with a small salad. They take debit and give a decent discount if you show your student ID. The place has a casual, relaxed ambiance and usually isn't loud or crowded. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I ordered the silver sushi combo to go today when they had the 30% off anniversary discount. All I can say is for the cheap price, it was acceptable. The shrimp was dry and bland. The fish looked fresh and hopefully they cleaned it thoroughly. If it hadn't been for the high traffic today, I would have not trusted this tiny place. Also, they were sooo stingy on the wasabi that I finished all of mine with half a container of sushi left. It was pretty obvious that the chef did NOT put much heart into making my food. It really felt like a Japanese fast food place, not to mention the greasy smell of my entire container due to the little bit of tempura in my hand roll.  Service was below average. They made me feel like I had to rush through even signing my receipt. I hated the tiny, confined, dining room that I decided to wait outside.   There are way better places where food is prepared with care, not just speed."}
{"text":"I have taken out plenty of times from Sushi Club and am always very satisfied at the taste and value of their fare.  The lunch specials are an amazing deal; $7 will get you miso soup, salad, and a main dish.  While not being the most amazing sushi, the rolls are consistently tasty and fresh.  I especially enjoy the spicy tuna/salmon and dynamite.  Great value and a recommendation for anyone around the area looking for quick, reliable, and cheap Japanese food."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food is ok. Its usually cold, however, which is pretty gross. But what really irritates me about this place is the service. It is beyond terrible. First off, I came in to pick up takeout and it took of the four people working behind the counter five minutes to even acknowledge that I was there. Then, the girl who was working the cash was incredibly rude, when I asked for spicy mayo with my takeout she said in an unmistakably rude tone that she'll get it in a minute. Then she told me to \"just sit down, ok, your food isn't ready yet.\" awesome. I was there five minutes later than I was told the food would be ready, and I still waited ten minutes for the food. Food comes and she barely grunts as she hands it to me. By the time I got home, which was about a five minute walk, the food was cold and soggy. The rolls were falling apart, the tempura was a mess and barely edible. The side of rice we ordered was also cold. Most everything was either terrible or, at best, mediocre. I used to come in here a lot, never loved it and the service has always been subpar but it was close and quick. I will not be doing that again, however. Don't let the pictures of Christopher Walken dining at the restaurant hanging on the wall fool you. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"I ordered a dynamite roll and miso soup. The miso soup smelled rotten and the avocados were TOTALLY black. If you love decomposing food then please come to Sushi Club!"}
{"text":"The most notable thing about Sushi Club on Charles Street? Framed photos on the wall letting you know that both Christopher Walken and Andi McDowell have dined there! And the food's pretty good too.   For me this is strictly a sushi take out place. Although the staff are nice and very attentive, the room is tiny and the sushi is of the type best eaten in front of the television: inexpensive but reliable. A favorite indulgence is Sushi Pizza (their version is called Salmon Pizza). A combination of deep fried rice, mayonnaise and raw salmon, you just can't escape that this is junk food. But it is special Japanese-designed junk food, and that makes it somehow more acceptable.The Seafood Yaki Udon, with pan fried seafood and vegetables is by comparison more healthy, and equally good.   A nice bonus is the 10% discount offered on all pick-up orders that pay in cash."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. Some of the worst service I ever had. If the food was decent, I might have reconsidered, but the food was terrible too. You're better off spending a little more at Wow Sushi on Charles St towards Yonge St."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi places in Downtown Toronto. very casual place (i mean really casual) but still serve the best Sushi ever. The prices are very cheap (especially during lunch time). The service isnt the fastest, but reasonably OK.. The food is delicious. we eat there about twice a week, they also do local delivery and take out. All our friend treasure this place. the decoration isnt amazing but ok... the owners are very nice.. and once in a while will throw some free stuff on your table. The best tasty return for your $ investment"}
{"text":"This place is so underrated. It's a great neighbourhood joint with tasty, affordable Japanese food. Wide variety of dishes - nothing fancy but it hits the spot! Handrolls, ramen, apps, tempura that's not greasy... Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly since it's right beside my condo and convenient for satisfying a sushi craving.  If it weren't so convenient I don't think I would ever go back again though.  The sushi is decent but the service has drastically gone downhill over the past few years.  I'm at the point where I'm about ready to call it quits.  With takeout it's either errors and giving you items you didn't order or a ridiculously longer wait than communicated to you originally.    On our last dine-in visit the server seemed to be avoiding eye contact and wouldn't come to the table when we needed anything.  I'm used to this kind of service in an all you can eat restaurant but she seemed to care less about me spending more money.  I had to go to the counter to request our bill after watching the server ignore all of the patrons and stare at the wall for 5 minutes.    I wouldn't recommend Sushi Club to anyone which is a shame since it was never like this in the past."}
{"text":"Ordered Sushi Club for the first time last night via Just Eat and was terribly disappointed. Not only was the sushi poorly rolled and put together, but they were nearly two hours late in delivering. Every time I contacted the restaurant to see where their delivery person was, I got bs excuses like he was just a few blocks away even though he didn't arrive for another hour), and they didn't do anything to right the situation or even apologize. Will NEVER order from here again"}
{"text":"the wooden booths are what push sushi club to 3 stars it's a nice place for a casual conversation, a place to catch-up with friends   service was prompt but felt rushed. i don't like it when the bill gets dropped on the table without asking for it.   ordered:  chicken karage $5.95 -an ample serving of dark chicken pieces of MSG battered crispiness  spicy tuna maki roll $5.95 -8 pieces, which tasted ok, can't taste the tuna's freshness anyways after dipping the roll in  soy, wasabi, and it being slathered in spicy mayo  students get 5% discount yes! but only if you pay cash woohoo 60 cents saved"}
{"text":"I'm from the westcoast and we have amazing sushi there. Toronto sushi is very subpar but of all the places I've been to in Toronto so far this place is great for the price you are paying. I regularly go here, atleast once a week. Went to Ki last night for the first time but would recommend this place over Ki anyday!! The staff are super friendly and service is great."}
{"text":"Despite some negative reviews, my experience here has been quite good. It is not easy to find a sushi place where they GET the changes you want in a standard menu item for instance when I request the salmon to be well done in a bento box then it hardly is, however, here, it was as I desired. Also, the sushi is always fresh. Generally, it is not surprising that a maiden trip to a restaurant does not go well, but it is better to try a place at least twice to form a credible review."}
{"text":"Got the S5 - 8 x Spicy Salmon & 6 x Spicy Crab with soup and salad - $7.99  Soup - Not salty enough. Overall not offensive but incredibly bland.   Salad - Your typical lettuce in a bowl with three carrot shreds and half a small cucumber slice. Again, not offensive but very bland.  Spicy Salmon - Avocado included, which defeats the spiciness and which I have never seen in spicy salmon. I hate avocado and after pulling it out I realized there was very little salmon in the rolls. Too much mayo, which was off-white and unappealing. Maybe a baby with hypersensitive taste buds would find this slightly spicy. Bland and yucky creamy texture.  Spicy Crab - Nice taste and texture but not spicy in the least.  After finishing the meal I gave it a D grade..  Fine if you have relatively low standards and want to go somewhere cheaper than most places. You get more food than something of equal price you'd get in a grocery store. But if you're willing to spend $8 it would be worth it to spend the extra $5 for quality sushi elsewhere.   I would say spending $9.03 on this meal, tax in, was a huge mistake."}
{"text":"This is my go-to takeout place --Mostly because its across the street from my apt.   I seriously love sushi, but I have a bit of a touchy stomach with fish. Pretty much, if anything is going to poison me, its sushi. (Sigh, irony..)  I've eaten at this place literally dozens of times and have never been sick. Honestly its not the BEST sushi in town, but its palatable and affordable. The staff are reasonably friendly, and the food comes up fast.   The bottom line? Nothing to go out of your way for, but if youre in the neighbourhood, its a reasonable choice."}
{"text":"This place is so cozy, it's perfect to come on a winter night to enjoy some sushi and abstract from everything around. I have ordered take away before also, and everything was fresh and the portions were great for the price.  The waiters are very friendly, and make the restaurant feel even more homey."}
{"text":"For the area, good prices. Always only order the chicken curry rice but other reviews suggest the food is good quality. Service could be better but i think it's more of a cultural barrier that they should be aware of and move past since it's downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Sushi Club was my go to when in the Yonge/Bloor area however no longer. Visited this past Friday and the quality of food has definitely gone down hill.  I typically dine in or take out later in the evening.   Orders are always sushi and the occasional edamame and/or tempura.  I have been going here over the years and have noticed especially the last two visits that the portion size has decreased.   Prices are reasonable with sushi starting at $4.99 and their lunch specials at $6.99.  It's a decent place when in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Sushi club is a really affordable restaurant to eat at for enjoyable à la carte sushi. Additionally they have a discount option if you pay with cash, which is great as well. I ordered the spicy salmon tempura roll and was impressed with the value that I received for around $6. The 8 pieces of the roll had crispy and juicy salmon, and I didn't feel that they skimped out on the amount of fish they included. My partner ordered the spicy vegetarian roll combo which came up to $12 for three sets of rolls (spicy yam, mango and avocado + cucumber) and those were delicious as well and came with a side of miso soup and a green salad. We also ordered the sweet and spicy tofu which came out steaming to the table. Eat this one while it's hot, because it's delicious right when it's fresh.   Overall we enjoyed the convenience and quick service at this restaurant as well as the quality for the affordable price. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Club is an alright place to grab a cheap bite.  It's not terrific sushi.   It's a small non-descript sushi joint that is suitable for quick work lunches or take-out if you are too lazy to make dinner.  They take a long time to prepare your food, even if the restaurant isn't busy.  I had enough time to go to the Rabba's next door and buy some fresh fruit for the week... and I still had to wait a good 10 minutes for my sushi take-out.  For the price, it's what I expected. I can't pretend I won't be back when lunch specials are $6.99. I'll just turn away and not watch the sushi chef slowly manhandling the saran wrapped raw fish."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a student, and this restaurant has been here for many many years.  I always got the same thing here.  Katsu-don.  It comes in a heavy lil iron cauldron.  I had not been here in years, so when I had a craving and I was in the neighbourhood, my feet just naturally lead me this way.  Nothing has changed about the place.  Still dark, cramped, and outdated.  But the food is still good right?  Not really.  I ordered my beloved katsu-don.  It did not come in the cauldron.  It came in a normal bowl.  But this is where the story turns sour.  Without looking, I took a big spoonful in my mouth.  It came with some extra.  A TON of broken egg shells in the egg and on the Katsu.  Not like ONE.  A bunch.  I told the waitress about it, and showed her just the two large pieces sitting on the top.  She didn't seem to really care, but she took it away to the cash to be inspected by the middle-aged owner, and then just brought it back to me.  She told me it's just egg shell.  She asked me if I could just eat around it. She seemed angry that I wanted a new one.  And she confirmed again if I really needed a second one, muttering it's just egg shell.  Never any apology.  Not once.  5 min later, a new bowl just plopped down on my table, no eye contact, nothing, she just walked off.  I couldn't even enjoy my second one because I kept looking for egg shells, and wondering if they added something \"special\" to my dish in the back.  I packed the majority of it in a box, half wanting to get it inspected at a lab.  We paid, left no tip.  My husband tried to point this out to the waitress again that asking customers to eat egg shells is NOT OK, and she gave him a hard time and just rolled her eyes.  Not only is it not enjoyable to eat, egg shells are some of the dirtiest, most bacteria-laden things.  Salmonella and E. Coli are a VERY serious issue to a pregnant woman.  Apparently, this restaurant does not give a damn.  Luckily,  I did not get sick."}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan of Sushi Club!  As far as \"junk food\" sushi places go (as people below have described) this place is at the top of my list!  Popped in for a Sunday hangover lunch with Mr. Karl R, and grabbed a booth. One of my favourite things about sushi restaurants is when they have the little Japanese-style booths, so this made me warm up to the place right away. Decor inside is nothing too spectacular, but they have these flower ornaments on the walls that were pretty cute.  Menu wasn't huge, but definitely substantial. The lunch deals are amazing! My meal was soup, salad and 14 rolls...for $6.99! (Well technically my meal was free, courtesy of my Yelp sugar daddy, Karl R). And for that price I was impressed with the quality. Often I get spicy tuna or spicy salmon rolls and they don't actually have much heat...but my spicy salmon rolls today had a nice kick to them. And my tempura crab rolls were light on the tempura--just the way I like it.  My only complaint is for the service. Our waitress wasn't very friendly, and it kinda seemed like she was mad at me (perhaps because I took a while to decide what I wanted). The strange thing is it seemed like she was in a real hurry to get us in and out, but once we were finished it took her a while to clear the plates, bring the bill and then bring change. On the plus side, we didn't have too wait long at all for the food to arrive.   If I'm in the area again I will definitely come back to this place. I want to  be a member of the Sushi Club!"}
{"text":"The service is fast, the food is great, and the price is right. I would highly recommend swinging by for a bite. I'm usually in and out in less then 30 minutes whenever I drop by on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Very cheap and cheerful Sushi place with lunch specials and student specials galore. I've had the cold noodles and lots of the sushi specials from here. Three lunch specials yields a ton of food for a very modest $36 price tag. We live very close by and hence I can only give a review for lunch takeout. Its usually quite busy at lunch when I go in, which is a good sign as it means the fish is fresh."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times with friends who live in the area. I was really disappointed with my last visit. I ordered a sashimi plate with fourteen + types of sashimi. Quite a few types of the fish were not fresh and I had to discretely spit them out. There was also other food remains (or dirt... I really hope it wasn't) on the salmon that they served me. I was pretty disgusted.  I have ordered rolls here in the past and they were okay (nothing to be too impressed by).  I was just really shocked at how awful the sashimi was. I didn't eat half of it as it tasted off and I didn't want to get food poisoning. I was really disappointed and will definitely try and sway my friends to try another sushi restaurant in the area next time."}
{"text":"The best poke I have ever had, in fact it is the first poke I had, and now I can't get the same thing anywhere else!! The all you can eat is definitely a good thing if you are hungry as most things are included and they will give you a card that is a frequent guest card. I really do recommend this place. There are so many new sushi places, but from a source that went to medical school in Reno where they have an outlet, I hear that 4 out of 5 almost doctors recommend it up there!!"}
{"text":"Lunch special's a good, but similar items can be found at any of the other thousand sushi restaurants nearby.  Service SUCKS. Although I will admit to seeing a busy Japanese place ignore their customers, Sushi Club does not have the full house to do the same thing,   We waited 10 minutes, on a slow night, for our miso soup. 15 minutes later we actually got our food. After the meal we had to ask after a long wait for the bill, then waited FOREVER for it. We waited so long we dabbled with the idea of a dine and dash - something we have never even considered in the past.   They just didn't seem to care whether you were enjoying yourself or not. I've been too way to many high turnover places to justify the treatment, And we tried multiple times! Quality is better then you'd get in the area (minus yorkville) but in my opinion it isnt worth that crap service"}
{"text":"Below average sushi for Toronto (meaning unacceptable for anybody coming from a city with actual good sushi).  The rolls are fried tasting, the service is SLOW (although polite).  I just can't justify anyone coming here except for the fact that it is in a great location for people on living in the highrises here that are too lazy to walk 3 blocks further to get decent sushi."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with their dynamite roll presentation but service was pretty good. There isn't a whole lot of seating and it is pretty cramped with my jacket right next to the heater! The sushi rolls were mediocre maybe I should have ordered a bento box instead but the price is good. 6.99 or 7.99 for lunch that comes with soup and salad."}
{"text":"Ugh...I think I hadn't eaten here recently enough at the time of my previous review, which I now recognize as being too positive (and I only called the food \"relatively pleasant!\"). Or maybe I've just been in denial, having visited countless times over the last 2-3 years and wanting desperately to believe, like a hungry Mulder and Scully, that I was still getting a good lunch deal.  Either way, I'm updating my rating to reflect the very consistent weird aftertaste of their lukewarm sushi. I am experiencing it as we speak, so I know it well.  The rest of the food (noodles, tempura, etc.) is still decent, but when soup and salad is the highlight of your sushi dining experience, your standards are too low. It's not called Soup and Salad Club, people."}
{"text":"We watched this building being built.  It's in an odd little triangle of land behind the Smith's shopping center on Eastern.  We went for lunch today.  Our first impressions were pretty favorable.  It's a large modern space with a truly huge three sided sushi bar and plenty of tables with tableclothes.  There are three large screen televisions playing ESPN and also techno music.  The music was entirely too loud and most of the patrons had to shout to be heard.    Although there is a menu, most people are here for the all you can eat sushi ($14.95 for lunch, $19.95 for dinner).  My husband felt a little ignored by the sushi chef, who was talking cars with another patron.  But the fish was very fresh.  The hamachi was outstanding and sweet.  There are a lot of hand rolls and long rolls, though most of them just have cryptic titles without any descriptions at all.  We had the very good Club Sushi Roll (diced tempura shrimp, diced cucumber, with spicy sauce).  The chef even made me a special roll with eel and cucumbers, even though he had nothing like it on the menu.  My husband's standard, Saba (Mackeral), was good.  Not the best or most inventive sushi I have ever had, but very solid."}
{"text":"Since being sick the past couple weeks, I was finally able to return to the land of the living recently & consume whole foods.  My renewed appetite was craving sushi so I began my quest on Yelp, researching various cheap sushi places around the downtown subway areas. I saw decent reviews for Sushi Club & after checking their menu online, I headed over there w/my BFF. The place is rather snug but I didn't mind. The service was decent. No one went the extra mile but it's a small sushi restaurant; I wasn't picky. I did notice quite a bit of people entering who had ordered takeout so I realize it's a hot spot for that.  We ordered the Dynamite Roll, Chicken Teriyaki roll, the Spider Roll (soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, tobiko & mayo) & the New York Roll (crispy fried white fish, tobiko, spicy mayo & avocado). My BFF loved the NY roll & I enjoyed the Dynamite roll. We both loved the Spider roll & were on our way to stuffed by the time the Chicken Teriyaki roll came out. I didn't like that they made regular chicken rolls & then drenched the roll in a huge amount of teriyaki sauce. But we finished our food & my belly's craving was satisfied. I love that I can get up & pay at the cash as one of my pet peeves is waiting trying to make eye contact with the server to bring you your bill.  Now the reason I've taken off stars is for cleanliness. As we were sitting digesting our food, a cockroach came on to the table to say hello. I freaked out as my BFF killed it. We quickly left after that. It may not be a big deal to some as the trip was great up until that point. It thoroughly disappointed me as the place looks very clean from the outside. However, I know that every time I go back, i would be thinking about that unwanted visit from that bug family and how many more of them reside there. And since I know there are better reviews of other places around the city, that ending will prevent me from going back there."}
{"text":"I have to admit, this place is cheap.  They have lunch specials starting at 6.99 that includes miso soup and salad.    I ordered this a combo which I believe was Dynamite and Eel maki rolls for $8.99.  The rolls tasted okay, but a bit too much rice and filler. I didn't really taste much eel in the eel maki roll.  The miso soup was a bit salty as well.  In terms of service, we had to ask for water and you pay up front for the bill.   Verdict: It's not the best sushi in town, not the worse, but decent value. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is a really affordable establishment  for lunch or dinner. Some of the rolls were just $5, furthermore, a glass of wine was around the same price!  You can find some combos which include miso soup & salad.  They have some semi-private booths in case you want to go with a date (wink).  I ordered a combo of sashimis with rolls. The quality of the fish was average, however, I was happy because everything came with the perfect temperature (I hate when parts of the fish are still semi frozen or cold)... Not the case in here tho. I dare to say that this factor helped the salmon to release it's oils and feel more tender.   The rolls didn't have the annoying too much rice and they were regular mouth size. I liked the dressing of the salad.The miso soup tasted recently made.  The waitress was polite, also the order came by fast.  I ate everything+ I was happy with the amount the check showed= I'll go back."}
{"text":"I come here often I find the sushi is good, most of the time.the service is reasonably ok. The price is good. I usually enjoy my meal and would rate this place higher.  But what has moved  me to write this review is the last couple of times I've been there the male waiter and the new sushi chef have been rude to me. I came sat down usually they know what I want and just bring it. So I thought these two are new so maybe they don't know my usual. I waited  10 min for them to either bring my usual or ask me what I wanted.  There was in all only 3 tables at the time came in.The waiter never came over. Then he served a party that came in after me. It wasn't busy that afternoon and it was late  in the afternoon. So I got up and left and had lunch at Wow sushi.  Now if that had been the only issue I had in this short time between visits I wouldn't bother to write this. But I went back the same male waiter and New sushi chef was on. The owner was there so my usual came with its usual efficiency. But when my sushi came there was excess of  hot sauce and it was very messy. Also I usually order no mayo, I am not sure this had little Mayo on it.  So in all I would just like to see improvements  in service because I really love coming here and would be sad to move on to a new place."}
{"text":"I'm not a raving fan. I got a lunch special for $6.99 (avocado roll and yam tempura roll, soup and salad) and a spicy salmon roll for $5.95. The rice wasn't well seasoned and it was hot (one of my pet peeves). The yam tempura was undercooked. The salmon was soooo small in the roll. I've seen more salmon in $4 rolls at other places. They also say their rolls are 8 pieces to give you the idea you are getting more value for their inflated prices but the slices are just smaller, it's a standard 6 piece roll cut differently. The soup and salad were standard but a little on the bland side, I like saltier miso soup. The servers were ok. The carpet needed to be vacuumed. All in all it wasn't offensive but it wasn't good enough to go back."}
{"text":"As all of the others have mentioned, pretty good - and reliable - sushi. Been in the actual restaurant (which is nice, staff is friendly) and ordered take-out."}
{"text":"Sushi Club is one of those places you eat at when you don't really care. You have those days, don't you? Where you're kinda hungry, but you don't really care if you have sushi, or a sandwich, or some pasta... the only quality your meal needs to have is that the place is reasonably located. That's how I always end up at Sushi Club. The food is alright, the service isn't great but on the other hand it's not offensively bad, and it just happens to be close when I'm hungry. The lunch specials are pretty good, and they offer a 5% student discount (if you pay in cash). No tableside entertainment, unless you sit outside and watch the crazy homeless guy yell at people outside the Rabba next door."}
{"text":"It may be the late hour, around 10 pm that made this place so forgetful.  the service was lacking the miso soup was cold and the sushi was just not so fresh.  I think they just wanted to go home.  I wasn't happy at all."}
{"text":"I went here a few times and didn't have a particularly good impression of the place. What really tipped me off was when I came here with my mom. When her noodles arrived, they were lukewarm. My mother suspected that they weren't fresh and asked about the temperature, and the waitress gave a little laugh disappeared into the back, completely avoiding her question."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a cheap lunch! It's pretty small though so you might want to opt for take out. I had the udon and sushi Bento and both were delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"I agree with the way Rosemary describes Sushi Club. It's the junk food version but it's still so good. Their prices are actually pretty good too. I got the Deluxe Maki Set (soup, salad, 18 pieces of sushi) for $15! I don't think I've ever passed out from sushi before but for some reason, being full didn't register with me. I just kept on eating, and eating until I realized I was paralyzed on my couch unable to move for the next two hours. But it was so worth it!  The store itself is really small, probably the same number of seats as other sushi places but in half the size!  Also remember to tell them about the 10% off for pickup otherwise they won't give it to you and they deliver free for orders above $20!"}
{"text":"i've been here many time as i'm always in this area. the biggest appeal is that it's cheap, and tastes good for the price. however the rolls are usually not rolled completely/tightly, and the plating for some of their dishes is just terrible. The chirashi,which should have been easy to plate attractively (since its just the fish on top of rice!) looked like it was just thrown on top without any care. Their pork curry was disappointing as well. The pork was crisp, but lack any flavour. There wasnt even salt! To get any flavor i had to drench it in the curry sauce( which there wasn't enough of, and had to ask for another one)."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat with excellent prices. Never disappoints,  and is our main go-to on nights when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Check out, for sure, the lunch specials which run until 4:30 pm (some what bending the definition of the lunch hour) and go for $6.99 each. Each lunch special is basically a pairing of two different rolls, e.g., a spicy tuna roll and a california roll. Each special comes with soup and salad. The only down side of the roll/roll parings is they don't hit all possible permutations. My stunningly beautiful dining companion noted this and asked the waitress if she could have the front half of one special and the back half of another special. The waitress said it was possible but with a small additional charge of $1. That seemed reasonable to me.   Nothing really surprising here. But I do appreciate they keep their lunch specials going on weekends and to the crack of the dinner hour. A Shaka Zulu for that (http://static4.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/xEteN-dt9mpHha1Fyq1U6w/l). Miso and salad are standard but I did find the sushi rice to be on the superior end and the fish tasty and fresh. So another Shaka Zulu. After a slew of all you can eat sushi places that tend to skimp on rice and fish, it was a nice break."}
{"text":"Upon entering the store, there's this heavy pee smell. Bleh.  The cashier/server/chef gave off this weird vibe.  But the food was okay and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials.  Also, try to avocado salad. It's pretttty nice!"}
{"text":"Finally couldn't resist the ramen photos posted outside their storefront.   I've been living beside it for over a year now, never walked in because it just looked like a bad, hole in the wall sushi place. I went in, sat down, and ordered my shoyu ramen.  To my surprise, the ramen was REALLY GOOD. Definitely not up to par comparing to kinton/santouka, but good for a sushi place, and better than kenzo imo.  It came with 5-6 generous slices of pork, bamboo shoots(really fresh), egg, green onions, and sprinkle of corn. The broth was tasty and the noodles were up to par as well.   Don't know about their sushi but if you are craving ramen and live near by, definitely try the place out."}
{"text":"If you want fancy and intricately designed sushi plates, this is not the place. If you want acceptable and cheap sushi rolls, however, Sushi Club is awesome for that!  Their lunch menu states that their deals cost $6.99 and above, but only one dish costs $6.99- the rest is priced a little higher. Sushi Club's maki is rolled messily and is 90% rice, but it tastes alright. Their salad is very watery and lacks enough dressing to make it taste palatable. Their bento box is a good deal, however- it comes with salad, miso soup, and a few maki rolls along with their teriyaki and tempura. The tempura is crispy, but they use a lot of watery vegetables so it gives off a soggy taste.   The service is quite nice, and my cup of water was always filled. Most of the people inside eat by themselves or are students scrambling for a cheap dinner. I might come back only because it's so modestly priced, but it's not a place for you to specially travel to taste."}
{"text":"Good service, relatively cheap and can get 5% discount for students cash only. Food was not bad not special, would come here again for a cheap meal!"}
{"text":"I have come back several times for pick-up after my original review and they have never disappointed.  I just tried their sushi salad - oh my!  The best salad I've ever had.  Spring mix, salmon sashimi, shrimp, surf clam, tobiko with their japanese salad dressing.  Consistently quick service, fresh sushi and I have yet to try a weird combo."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because I read the sign wrong. We had a maki combo and a bento box that was focused around tempora. The maki was cut badly and my partner had something hard in one. The tempora had that thing where the oil isn't quite hot enough so things get soggy and oily without getting crispy. Overally a disappointing experience. It was bad enough that we decided not to have any more Japanese food for a good long while afterwards, from here or otherwise."}
{"text":"Sucks!  Hungry for Asian food, thought we would give this place a try.  Called 4 times to order delivery but kept getting hung up on.  When I finally got through without a hang up, it was so incredibly noisy in the background that after giving her my contact number SIX TIMES, I finally gave up and ended the call.  Clearly, karma was saying a big NO to ordering from here.  Suggestions:  maybe find a quieter corner to take take out orders."}
{"text":"I feel like this is one of those places that have more bad qualities than good qualities yet I can't bring myself to give it anything less than 5/5 stars because I love the food and just keep coming back. Been visiting Sushi Club since 2013, and I'm never disappointed by the experience. Service is very slow and the waitresses hardly speak any English, but the food really does make up for it. The prices are very decent and the portions are reasonable. Not the cleanest place, but the staff will wipe the tables for you again if you ask them nicely. Again, despite all the things that would normally deter me from entering a restaurant again, the food brings me back every time. For those who are iffy after reading my review, try getting take-out, and you avoid all of the problems and still get to enjoy the delicious sushi!  My favourites are the spicy salmon rolls, the fried calamari, and the pork bone ramen. All very delicious and flavorful, and you can even order all three for ~$20!  All in all, it's a good place to eat. Excellent food, great prices. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out because it was near where one of my best friends live. I was wary about it because I've been to similar looking sushi places and have had horrible results occur.  I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the menu.  I ordered:  Shitake Tempura -$6.00 - Sounded great, It was a bit of a letdown it lacked taste and there was little desire to finish the appetizer. Yam/Avocado Roll $5.00 - An interesting twist that isn't at all sushi locations. I saw it and had to try it. Well worth it. Salmon Tempura Rolls $6.00 - Not your standard Salmon Tempura roll but was pleasing. California Roll $6.00 - Standard California Roll, not bad at all. (Note: These prices are approximated)  It could have gone wrong, but it didn't. Definitely worth a look if you are in the Bay/Bloor area."}
{"text":"*In fairness, my dining companion also ate salmon (albeit not the same roll) so maybe it wasn't food poisoning. But the service, setting, and food were still subpar so I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever had. We came in for a late lunch around 3 and the only server was eating her lunch. She seemed pissed off to see customers and took a good 5 minutes until she got up to say something. Took another 10 for water after she rudely asked \"what do you want?\" The sushi wasn't anything special besides the prices because of the lunch special. Wouldn't recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Decent food, alright prices, but bad service. Not once was our water or tea refilled, and they did not follow my request when I asked for no onions in my soup. If you wanted the attention of the waitress, you had to go find her because she conveniently could not hear us calling her."}
{"text":"Sushi joints are aplenty in the Yonge/Bloor area so the question remains - Where are all the good ones?  I checked out Sushi Club for takeout during lunch.  I ordered the S2 - Dynamite Rolls and Avocado Maki ($7.99).  It came with a miso soup and a green salad.  Order was put together quickly and food was good.  I also dined in at Sushi Club for lunch.  Decided to go with S8 - Salmon Tempura Rolls and Crab Maki ($7.99).  It was 1pm and the lunch rush had almost passed.  Only a few tables remained but my order took over 20 minutes to arrive.  And I was a bit disappointed that my rolls had cooked salmon, not raw, although this was not indicated on the menu.  For the price, the lunch combos are decent.  I would be paying approximately the same for the cold sushi rolls found at the grocery store, and that generally doesn't come with a miso soup and green salad.  A solid 3.5 stars and I rank Sushi Club in the same company as the Sushi Inn (on Cumberland)."}
{"text":"Average place for sushi. I almost always get the silver box because it's the most economical! There's also a 5% discount for students if you show ID.  They are very fast at making the food, even during the meal rushes!"}
{"text":"I swore I already reviewed this place. Very mysterious.  Anyway, this is a completely average sushi joint. $6.99 lunch specials. Decent/quick service. Few outdoor tables for seating when the weather isn't -25 degrees. Interior is small, probably seats about 25 max.   OK for lunch if you are in the neighbourhood, but nothing worth going out of your way for. Located between Rabba and the Health Shoppe on Charles Street West, just across from the Manulife Centre."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. Their sushi rice (the maki) is warm, which is kind of weird. Lunch special is cheap. I wouldn't mind come here once in awhile, but if you want good Japanese food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and have never been disappointed.  The Sushi is always good, tightly rolled and visually appealing, while the Gyoza is hot and seared just right. Wash that all down with a ASAHI and you bill is still under $20.  That's a win my friends!"}
{"text":"Went here after our visit to the ROM. Small hole in the wall place with great lunch specials. Got the salmon teriyaki Benton box that comes with a salad and soup for appetizer, pretty good and a lot of food. The boyfriend got a lot of different rolls and seemed to enjoy them. They have vegan rolls for my cousin available. Loses one star because although we were the only people in the place, the waitress checked on us once after ordering and we had to call her over for the check."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch while we were downtown. When we walked in it was completely empty and the waitress there told us to sit anywhere. So we sat down and looked at the lunch specials and after sitting there for 20 minutes we finally flagged down the waitress to take our order (who had disappeared for those 20 minutes). When she came over she was wearing headphones (!) and said \"what do you want\" in an annoyed voice. Sorry for bothering you? Our sushi came out quick but it wasn't that good in my opinion. But I guess that's why it was so cheap."}
{"text":"Been eating here several times since my review and while the sushi still ain't bad at all, the service seems to be going down.  Last night we caught an early dinner due to Hot Docs at 6:30 and the place was practically empty, so no reason for this.  We asked for low salt soy which was never brought, the edamame pods were never cleared, it was next to impossible to get the waitress' attention when we were ready to pay, and even when we left, there was no eye contact or goodbye, unusual in Japanese custom which has always made greetings to the patron such a priority and quite charming.   Take care, Sushi Club.  You are only one of many thousands of Sushi joints in this city and it's just as easy to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I live close by so I have dined in about 3-4 times and ordered take out once. I actually don't like their soup, I think they use a water base instead of a broth base so the taste of soybean paste overwhelms everything else; the taste of the seaweed, tofu, and green onions completely disappears. While the above mentioned ingredients are not the main ingredients of miso soup,they should blend in and enhance the quality of the taste of the soybean paste/miso. Their salad on the other hand, is quite enjoyable in my opinion. The dressing is light and not cream based.  Their sushi rolls, as mentioned by other yelpers, tend to be served warm. The taste is nothing spectacular, though not terrible. The salmon pieces on the sushi and in the handroll (I ordered a salmon combo during my mosr recent visit) were dry and tasteless. I am usually very forgiving about the quality of the fish when it comes to cheap sushi.  The space inside is also quite tight, so I would not recommend this place for groups larger than 4. The servers don't smile and are usually annoyed when you show your student ID to get the student discount (no idea whether they are still doing this or not).  All in all, it's a good place to go to for the pure sake of filling an empty stomach, but don't expect too much in the taste and service departments."}
