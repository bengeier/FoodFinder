{"text":"I just ordered from Sushi Crave again and had to leave a review. Really good sushi, fresh and tasty as usual. Very friendly owners/operators in the restaurant...my favourite for takeout sushi.  I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"My friend and i went there a few days ago. The restaurant is not big,but it is cozy.we ordered several sushis. All of them are savory and fresh. Also the main point is cheap, and they look chici really recommend this restaurant. I love it!!!!BTW! The service is truly nice."}
{"text":"I really love this neighbourhood sushi joint. It's small but bright and cheery and the owners are always very friendly. We have had both take out and stayed in for sushi and it is always fresh and delicious. I love that they don't drown their spicy tuna rolls in that nasty orange mayo crap, but use a more translucent spicy sauce which packs a nice punch. They always have my favourite hokkagai (surf clam) and the shrimp tempura is really good. On a recent visit I tried the Mango Paradise roll which had a neat mustard mayo sauce which went really well with the mango. I always order either ginger ale or sake with my sushi but they do have complimentary green tea. I would have some but I am opposed to styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but was very frustrated recently trying to place an order. I phoned it in and had to repeat myself over and over because they couldn't understand me and once I arrived it was still wrong. They also have loyalty cards which used to get you a maki roll of your choice but when I went to use it they said things have changed and all you can get is a california roll in exchange which I thought was cheap. I enjoy the sushi but not sure I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to try the sushi at Sushi Crave earlier in the week.  I'm a huge sushi fan, and I found the sushi at Sushi Crave to not be fresh, and rather bland tasting.  I ordered 3 different types of rolls and each of tasted like the fish was not fresh.  It will be the first and last time I eat Sushi there."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place near work, and stumbled across Sushi Crave. This place is quite small, but there is some seating. I love that they have complimentary green tea. That is definitely an added bonus! The staff are really friendly and welcoming, I've never had bad service in all the times I've been here. I really like their Spicy Salmon and Tuna rolls. Those are my go-to at every sushi restaurant, and they definitely make good ones here! You can tell the fish is really fresh and the rolls are well made. 

I tried the Mango Paradise roll the other day to shake up my routine (yep, living on the wild side). It was amazing! Who knew mango in a sushi roll would be so good?? The mayo on top is a nice compliment to the sweetness of the mango, and I would definitely order it again. They also make awesome gyoza, and it has become a staple for me everytime I order here. It isn't a place to go for a romantic dinner or anything. But if you want take out or a quick bite, then definitely try it out. It is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Pricy, but really good.   I really like their platters.  The dine in space is small, but clean and inviting.  I really enjoy watching My food be prepared.  The staff are friendly. Sometimes it can take a bit to get your food, but it's well worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Love this place. Servings are so big at such a cheap price. Staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Good fresh fish. Great service. They have a couple stools but mainly a takeout joint."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. A few tables and jazz make the small seating area surprisingly relaxing. Not much of a design or decorations, just simple white tables. Average cleanliness. Always disappointed when served farmed not wild salmon. Overall: Good for a quick Fresh Sushi fix."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past four years. I used to love this place. I still like it and come here when I'm really desperate for a sushi fix because it is close to my house. 

Otherwise, this sushi is not very exciting. The fish isn't the best quality, and I find it very expensive for what you get. I was happy with the quality of rice this time; I've had their rice fall apart a few times before. My bill came to $30 for a few of basic rolls and an order of Takoyaki, of which I've had better. 

So because of the close proximity to my home I may be back .. but because of the value and quality it's only OK, so three stars from me.

I do consider sushi to be my favourite food or at least in the top three next to the lobster and poutine! And I have to say that I've never really eaten truly exceptional sushi in Calgary. This is a landlocked city with no fresh fish available, so this is probably why."}
{"text":"Very neat and clean sushi place. They mostly do to-go, so they only have 2 sets of tables.
The owners are friendly and speedy.
Price is very reasonable.

I love their sushi rolls. Everything tastes fresh and balanced, and they don't cut corners with the ingredients. 

My favorites are the mango rolls and haru-haru rolls (with strawberries!). The flavor combinations are just perfect. You get the richness from crab and avocado, then the fruits cut in and add a touch of tart and sweetness. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly here and their food is quite fresh. We've only ever gotten takeout from them as they only have a few places to sit but we've gotten fairly quick service every time. The prices are also super reasonable!"}
