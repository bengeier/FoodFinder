{"text":"Good sandwiches but prices are higher than quality of food. Deliver until like two am which is way later than others.   Great if you're a bar next door to it patron,  they bring food right to yoy"}
{"text":"I'm not really a complainer but it took my two lg cheese pizza over a hour to get delivered to my house which is 6 minutes away. Pizza look so delicious until we took a bit and the dough was not fully cooked! Like if it was rushed to me . So then I called them back and he said that they were busy and short someone for the night. Overall I'm not ordering pizza from there again.  I was hoping to find a pizzeria by my house so we can be locals There. Unfortunately that didn't happen."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's always delicious! The pizza has a lot of flavor, a nice crust and delicious toppings! The garlic knots are amazing!"}
{"text":"Well, you get what you pay for.  Sorry, boys, but this pizza is for the dogs.  We stopped by on our way out of Vegas after EDC.  The dough is passable, but was that strange white substance on top actually mozzarella?  Looked more like Elmer's Glue.  And that sauce, ugh.  If this is the pie that Tropicana Pizza has always served, no wonder this is the last location left.  Didn't have the wings, but I can't imagine they are anything more than something that went from freezer to fryer to plate."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The ranch is to die for. I got takeout at 10pm and it was amazing. Ate here 18 months ago and I've recommended it since. I'm from LA and this is the first thing I'll eat when I get here. Hopefully none of the recipes have changed cause they were doing a damn good job when I went."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from here and it definitely tastes good. I got the chicken and bacon topping. I was surprised the chicken was breaded but it made a world of difference in texture which I was happy about. The pizza was loaded with cheese which is another plus. It is a little gem so don't expect it to be as \"fancy\" as Domino's or pizza hut. But do expect Tropicana Pizza to taste better and be cheaper."}
{"text":"I took a star off cause delivery takes FOREVER but when it shows up it's hot and fresh from my experience. I've ordered the chicken strips, chicken wings, cheese Burger and calzone before from here. The calzone was kinda over cooked but it was huge,  enough to feed 3 people. The chicken strips are good and reasonably priced.   You can also choose what kind of wings and chicken strips you want. They all come with fries unless you get an A la carta or something. They do charge extra for the ranch but you get a big cup of it though, so it's worth the 50 cent. They stay open late as well."}
{"text":"So pizza is a common good but this place boom pow haha blew me away it's very good indeed but customer service is ehhh so 3 stars"}
{"text":"Since this place was close, I thought I would try it. So I ordered a variety off the menu and it was disappointing to say the least, the pizza especially."}
{"text":"The pizza was nice the first 2 x I order from them but after that its like their service went downhill they started delivering my family and I burnt pizza and with the wrong topping I orded from here about a week straight and by the end of the week  the food  that I received changed I called to let them know and the said they would fix it but nothing happened so I'm straight off them"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good and reasonable priced. You can't go wrong with any of there pizza choices. The staff is are nice and great to talk to. Will definitely be making the trip back to get more of their pizza and the wings."}
{"text":"Had the worse experience at this place with a pickup order that we ordered at 7:55 pm when wife gets home at 9:30 from driving their they messed up the order. When we called the associates were laughing in the background not caring that they messed up and laughed about messing up. Who's the manager of this place. They claimed to be busy when my wife and her friend said they were dead and was talking about no one wanted pizza cause of the weather. Jerimaha should really be trained better at customer service."}
{"text":"I was a regular here, I ordered frequently, because I loved their ranch.  Usually the people who answered the phone were friendly and helpful. Though I ordered tonight, and some older guy answered. I could tell it was busy and he was rushing, but he was very curt and short while trying to place the order, he rushed every aspect like I couldn't talk fast enough for him. He didn't even give me my total before he said good bye and moved on to the next call. Then when the order arrived, it wasn't a half pepperoni/sausage, half pepperoni/mushroom pizza and mild wings as I ordered. Instead it was a half pepperoni, half pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza (which \"coincidentally\" offers them an added cost for the same amount of toppings, just different arrangement) and PLAIN wings. When I called right after the driver left, the guy who took the order blamed the \"miscommunication\" on me, then called me a liar about the wings, saying he \"tossed them himself\". I even took a picture of the PLAIN wings for proof, but that was as far as he was willing to go; A regular customer got the wrong order because he was in a hurry, that customer was also over charged, and \"too bad\", because he couldn't care less.  It's sad that I have to stop frequenting a place I loved, but if that is their new customer service attitude, I would rather not waste my money there."}
{"text":"I had been talking with someone at work last week, and they suggested this a a great place for an inexpensive, great-tasting pizza.  So we sallied forth, infiltrated the place of purveyance and negotiated the vending of some combustibles.  In a word: average.  In several words: the pizza was alright, the cheesy bread was good, and the hot wings were OK.  Maybe we got there on a bad night (it WAS 110 degrees at 6:PM), so I don't know.  All in all though, I'll still go to Napoli."}
{"text":"First time getting food from here last night and defiantly will return! We got 2 pizzas, a half bucket of wings and a half bucket of fingers for $40. Everything was cooked perfectly, pizza wasn't too greasy, chicken was moist and we had plenty of ranch and hot sauce on the side. The best part was their hospitality! Each person we encountered was friendly and helpful! They were also attached to the bar next door which is defiantly convenient for those who order from next door! Service was fast too! We went in to order and waited maybe 20 minutes if that. They also deliver and you can go and sit down to eat there. Always happy to help local businesses! Will be back for more(:"}
{"text":"I love the pizza, chicken fingers and ranch! It's a great night if I get to go to Tropicana pizza. Best pizza in town. We need more locations, especially in Henderson. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is the cheesiest and their wings are crisp and saucy. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I made an order for delivery last night, as me and the boys were cracking cold ones open, and I was informed that yall don't carry paper plates for deliverys? I personally thought that was wildly preposterous. Please get paper plates for deliveries. Food was A1 as always. Puro fuego. *fire emoji* cinco estrellas"}
{"text":"I've never set foot in this location, but I've had their delivery and leftovers several times- my guy and his coworkers regularly order from here because they deliver to Nellis, even late. Pizza is saucy and cheesy and inexpensive, while the wings are surprisingly meaty. I have yet to try the calzones or visit in person, but I'm glad this spot is an available option for the area."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are good. Not too big of a fan of the pizza. Its good if you want to spend under $30"}
{"text":"When my friend and I were in middle school,in the summer time we would come here all the time and get there mild chicken tenders... they are soooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate wings period!! I've tried everything and everywhere but Tropicana pizza has the BEST wings EVER. I also hate spicy! For them to convince me to eat chicken wings AND eat spicy, I thank them!! Lol really you guys, must go place and the customer service is OVER THE TOP EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"awesome food!! but the service could have been a little bit better.. seems like when u ask for certain things they didnt react to it too well.. but will give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"Okay here we go. The first time I came here with my brother we loved the food. Pizza was great, wings were juicy, steak fries on point. Customer service was exceptional even though they were busy and made us want to come back. Today, 2 weeks later, just ordered the same thing and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I would expect a similar service and a simple as \"hi welcome\" instead I got \"pick up or delivery\". The place was empty. No one in the back so I wish I was greeted better but anyway to the food. Fries were almost too salty to eat. Wife, who doesn't usually eat ketchup, drowned these fries in them in order to eat them. They had less cheese and onion than the first time.The pepperoni on the pizza was mostly just on one side and looked like they were just thrown on. The wings were dry. I don't know why this happened. Dont know if it was staff or end of the week but it felt like I experienced two different restaurant at the same place. This second time is enough not to get me to go back."}
{"text":"Hamburger was burnt and my husband said his food tasted awful. Ordered from uber eats"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and they made the 20 minute or so, a beeeze. we took our order to go, 2 orders of the 3 finger and fry combo, one original chicken fingers with crispy fries and one sweet chili chicken fingers with regular fries, both came plain, no sauce, no crispy fries so we're a little bummed about that. we also didn't get our onion rings? it just seems like they need a little more organization. the garlic knots are delicious and so is their ranch, i don't know if it's house made or store bought but regardless, super yummy. I would try this place again, I'm really interested in their pizza options and their prices are extremely affordable. if you're looking to try, definitely do, just double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pizza..Not bad at all. Their customer service is pretty good and their chicken tenders are yummy, buffalo wings are not bad either. So far so good."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite pizza and chicken wing spots. Located in the good ole EASTCYDE!   There used to be Tropicana Pizza joints all over the valley. Fortunately this one is the last one standing.  YAYAH!!! I've move away from the EASTCYDE but still find my way back to my roots. You can take the boy out of the EASTCYDE, but you can't take the EASTCYDE out of the boy.   This pizza always scratches that pizza and wings itch whenever I start to fiend.  I always get an X-large pepperoni with a bucket of plain wings w/ hot sauce on the side. They have always been on point. The pizza is always cheesy and  ALWAYS satisfying.  They're also open late until 2 am. FOR SHEEZIE! I will always support this EASTCYDE pizza joint. Thanks Tropicana Pizza!!!   I've got a pretty good munchie pallet. This place definitely places in my top 5.   EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!! Location is sketchy and staff is not the nicest but if you're used to just calling in your order and going in for pick up this spot is not too bad. Their wait time is always at least thirty minutes long but the pizza is always tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"This place has seriously failed to meet my expectations in the past couple of visits. They used to be really good and my go to place for pizza, however my last order with them will definitely be my last!      The last time i was looking for something to order i tried getting one of their deals online but when i called the girl told me that the deal no longer existed and they needed to update and she would not honor it since it was still there, so i said ok and ordered some chicken wings. When they got here I opened the box and 3 of the wings were almost pure bone and no meat. About every time I've seemed to order with them the past couple of times they've seemed to dissatisfy me over and over again so for that reason i will not order from them again"}
{"text":"I tried them for the second time and the hot wings are amazing!! The fries are delicious (albeit super greasy). I'm still not sure about the pizza though, it has a weird taste to it and the fact that the workers don't wear hairnets worries me."}
{"text":"Loved the staff and the food! Pizza sauce doesn't give me heartburn like most places .I was very impressed and will be returning to try more food."}
{"text":"I use to frequently order from this pizza place but lately they've been messing up my order or not having the order ready and I've had to wait 20 min when I got there so I don't think I will be coming back as often as I used to, pretty bad service tbh other than that the price is good, but they're just not good enough."}
{"text":"These guy's make there own hours. If they feel like showing up at 11 they show up. If they don't, they don't. Messes up my lunch break when they don't feel like opening up on time. Never heard of a pizza place opening up at 11 like they do. To unreliable."}
{"text":"This place has great wings and fries and the price is awesome. And all kinds of other specials. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"I had their pie, wings, tenders, and fries tonight. Best pizza and wings I've had in a long time!! My husband loved the Buffalo chicken fingers. Their ranch was delicious! Their prices are also right on point for what you get. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a few times. Each time it's been just ok. Girls on the phone aren't very nice, and it seems they take forever to complete your order.   We tried it again on Monday July 3rd. Two large pizzas and a large order of chicken fingers.   The pizzas were almost burnt and the fingers were so burnt or just totally dried out. Not good at all. And over $40?? I wish I would have got my money back."}
{"text":"All I can say is if u haven't been here your missing out. One of the best pizza & wing spot in Vegas.  I recommend this spot to everyone who lived good pizza & wings."}
{"text":"This is a great spot that I only recently discovered. I tried a very impressive thin-crust pizza with absurdly fresh olives, sausage and onions. I'm usually a fan of Papa J's or strip pizza joints... but Papa J's thin crust is frozen(yuck).   I recommend asking for extra sauce. I do recall the prices being cheap and the service quick. The menu here is also exciting... it offers items that even bourgeoisie people would eat."}
{"text":"I give three stars because they have a skinny guy with tats there that can really throw down on a pizza. But if he isn't there the pizza I always end up getting doesn't come out very good... it's super soggy and over loaded on sauce but has little toppings... on top of that we always get ignored until we holler for someone.. it's a bummer to cause I really like their food.. it just so happens my husband and I like it better when the night shift guy is in, he's very helpful and definitely makes our pizzas the way we like..."}
{"text":"The best of the best . I love this pizza. And there chicken fingers are huuug. I definitely recommend this place . And the ranch here is home made ranch."}
{"text":"Find this place on Yelp as we were coming back for the LVMS coming down the 15.  This place was much farther away than I thought and probably more out of the way than I would care to travel.  Pizza was decent, nothing special.  The garlic knots were really good, but not enough to merit coming all the way out here.  Probably a great place for locals, but if you don't already have business out in this area, not worth the trip out."}
{"text":"So the food is really good I love there pizza and their wings but the fries can be better. Sometimes I go in and I like the other times they are just huge amount of grease and no crisp. That's just me every one is different. Customer service was ok not horrible but I didn't feel welcomed or comfortable for getting my food. A lady had an attitude but maybe she had a bad day who know. It's not fancy people it's more like when you are drunk and u have the munchies I live super close we walk there when we are drunk and hungry hahah! Thank you for saving us on our drunk hungry runs!!"}
{"text":"This is pizza place is better than any on the east side , I like this place because the food is good and authentic . The pizza is always on point and they have the best chicken wings and ranch sauce . Also when I call to pick up I never wait more then 15 to pick up so the service is fast and good .  check it out ppl!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here at least a dozen times. I will not anymore. I always order a good amount and tip well. Times before they have forgotten an item and even a two liter like they did this time, but, the driver immediately went and purchased me one and brought immediately back and was very sympathetic about it. This time how ever they tell me he's gotta go to the shop and come back.... That would seriously take 30 minutes. Are you kidding me? That is not how good repeat business is earned."}
{"text":"I went in the area for some business, and boy!! I Was hungry! This place is inside the bar and it cool! So I walked in and order the 1/2 bucket of chicken wings and a small light cheese/mushrooms/well done pizza, the pizza was perfect just the way I like it!  D-WINKS was the killer!!! I ordered regular wings but add extra time for crispy and hot sauce on the side, it was really really good! Trust me when I say this cuz I know about food. I'll sure go back there again when I have to visit that side of the town. *****Proud to support small business"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this little pizza joint is connected to a bar...  So you get what you pay for, bar food. The pizza is made from canned veggies and sauce ,  you can see the fresh canned veggies on display right when you walk In the door because it's on display at the front counter.  . Not going to totally knock it though.  It's alright.  However , the employees don't pay much attention to special requests,  so be sure to check your pie before you leave other wise you will be turning on your oven at home to finish cooking the pizza, or it will crumble to dust because your \"well done\" request was taken too literally..    Now onto the wings. They are good , usually nice size wings but ask for extra sauce as they occasionally come out dry. I recommend these instead of the pizza. The employees mean well and are always pleasant. I hope the manager or owner decides to buy a mop and cleaning supplies one day though. Just sayin'. We will go to another Pizza joint from Now on."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Delivery sucks only because it took over an hour and my pizza looked as if it had been sitting on top of the oven for hours. My french fries were soggy as hell and, although, I sometimes do enjoy soggy french fries, I didn't appreciate them to be completely soggy! I literally found ONLY ONE french fry that was kind of crisp. I don't know if this is normal for delivery since I always just order to pick up (that's what I get for being lazy) but if it is, I would say just take the trip, it's worth it.   Other than that, Tropicana Pizza is cool."}
{"text":"No consistency. On hold for 10 mins. Got my order wrong. I don't understand. Retrain your staff."}
{"text":"They have to best wing and pizza. They have really great costumer service. Really recommend if you got the munchies."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints near me, if I could I would order their pizza everyday."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from this location twice. I remember back in the 80's and 90's Tropicana Pizza being just AWESOME - big, thin, fold able, greasy slices of yummy gut bomb pizza - USED TO BE. The first time was just OK but not bad. The second time was atrocious !!! I will never buy from this location again. We ordered a special they have for 2 large pizzas, 1/2 a bucket of wings and 1/2 a bucket of fingers. Everything came timely and the order was correct, but when it arrived we were informed by the delivery driver that the total he gave us on the phone was 10 bucks less than it should have been. OK now I am irritated at best. The food was correct, but as I was pulling out the extra hot sauce, under the edge of the lids on every hot sauce tub we received was a green and white mold just caked thick. So, I called and complained and they sent the driver out with \"new\" hot sauce and I gave him back the nasty sauce. After I showed him the mold he informed me that it was \"pizza sauce\" - GREEN AND WHITE FURRY PIZZA SAUCE ? HUH? I am a papered chef  I know what mold looks like. So, I said to the belligerent driver \"The problem is that I know how nasty and dirty your coolers are if you didn't even know there was moldy spilled sauce.\" after which I was informed that they do not keep their hot sauce in a cooler because \"you don't need to\". By now I am thoroughly pissed off. The next day I called the store manager and informed her of my issues with her night crew. She offered me 2 new pizzas, but as I told her, I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT KITCHEN.  I just wanted her to be aware of the goings on. BUYER BEWARE, it may taste good but...WHAT HORRORS LIE IN WAIT INSIDE THE KITCHEN UNBEKNOWNST TO YOU !!!  P.S. Read the \"filtered out\" reviews. They say the same. Why are they not shown? hmmmmmmm?"}
{"text":"Food might be alright, sometimes, but they have sketchy people working here with horrible customer service. For that alone, I'll never be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Their pizza used to be \"so so\" with a hand tossed crust and mainly went there for convenience because it is only  .4 miles from my house. But I ordered one last Saturday 3/11/17 and it was terrible. They changed the crust to thin crust \"which I usually prefer\", but this crust was like cardboard. I reheated a couple of pieces, added my own extra cheese and it still tasted hard and like crap. I had to throw away the last 4 pieces because it was just so hard and dried up, that I just couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"My food has been correct and good the past couple of times I have gone which is great. Everyone is really friendly who works there. Unfortunately they are highly understaffed. Yesterday they had just one poor guy doing everything. I gave l him a tip for his hard work, but you can't have someone taking orders, answering phones, making food, and doing dishes. The cleanliness factor is one thing...there's no time to wash anything (hands included) between all that running around by oneself. The owner/management needs to step it up. Hire more people."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful pizza places in a city full of suspect pizza slingers. Maybe because it is attached to a bar, and we all love bar fo extremely readyod, that the foods is done quickly and done. The wings and fingers are incredibly tasty. The pizzas are extremely good, and the price is rarely beaten by equally tasty pizza. To me its worth the twenty minute drive :-)"}
{"text":"Date(s) visited: about 6 times.  Food/Drink: 3/5 Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: 5/5 Parking: 5/5  \"Hole in the wall pit stop for good wings on the east side.\"  Food/Drink: The chicken wings are so tasty that I've found myself coming in every other day for them at one point. Another wonderful thing is that they do make their own ranch sauce (which is really good and will order extra). I've tried a few of the flavors but mostly the dry rubs and have no complaints. For $4.99 you can get wings with fries which come out hot, fresh, and crispy.  Because of my wanting to venture into other options, I've decided to try the calzone one day. They at the time did not have spinach so I had to choose three other ingredients out of what was available.  Upon receiving the calzone I noticed it was a pretty big size and the outside looked like it was baked perfectly.  When I got home to eat the calzone, it was gooey on the inside and half baked.  If it wasn't for the wings to keep me wanting to come back then I would still be there at least once a week regardless of my bad experience with my calzone.  But it is the service that I received yesterday which made me decide that I don't plan on coming back anytime soon unless there is new management.  Service: For the most part, service from the workers is friendly and the orders are brought out pretty quick.  There is the manager there with glasses who when I come in he just seems to be a little snippy every time I make an order. Actually, he was the person that I made my calzone order with and after taking it home and noticing it had that wet dough flavor, I called to talk to him about it. He then asked for me to come in to the restaurant because he would \"take care of me\".  I came in after a couple days to order an eight pack of wings instead of a calzone to make up for the discrepancy and he charged me $5 for my my order (with the wings being about same price as the calzone). His reasoning for my calzone coming out gooey was \"because their ovens don't cook them all the way through and that's just the way that they are\".  If that was the case then there is a problem in my opinion and the ovens need to either be fixed or calzones should NOT be made at all.  I came in a couple days later to order a salad and even brought a relative with me (wanting to give the establishment another chance because I love the wings there). I asked the manager about a particular salad and he in a very rude manner responds, \"we can't make that salad because we don't have all of the ingredients\".  This made me wonder why the salad was advertised on the chalkboard menu for customers to be misled when it could've easily been erased? Also this is not the first time that I've ordered anything where they did not have enough ingredients to make a final product.  Eventually one of the workers walked over where we were so then i ask him about a salad and he acknowledges me talking to him but immediately walks back to the order window and stands there. I sit there and I wonder to myself, \"Was he about to come and help us with our order or not?\" The whole experience really bothered me and I decided to walk out of the restaurant.   Atmosphere: the place is right next to a local bar in which I saw a lot of the workers going back and forth between both spots through a side door. I have to say from the ordering area you can see into parts of kitchen and it does look like they do a good job in cleaning the whole restaurant.  It's tucked away in a small hole in the wall  between a bar and a title loan  office on the east side.    Price: the prices aren't too bad for what you pay for.  MY THOUGHTS?: Sadly, this place lost my business due to bad service from their management. It's kind of funny how when I let the manager know that I thought my food should've been given to me for free (to make up for my last order which was a calzone that was uncooked), he addresses me by shortening my name as a way to appease me which only aggravated me even further (especially from someone I don't even know). My experience shouldn't dictate anybody else's experience of wanting to come back or let alone giving this place a chance. But I am yelping because of my disappointment in the service that I am apprehensive about receiving if ever I wanted to eat there again.  It's just unfortunate since I've talked highly about their food recently to my girlfriends who also live on the east side knowing how hard it is as an Eastsider to find good places to eat. I thought I found a gem and now that gem has lost its luster. I don't plan on coming back here anytime soon.    RECOMMENDATIONS: There is a Thai lady who works there who I suggest ordering from because she is really nice. Also, stay away from the calzones because you will be eating nothing but dough."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes i love this place;-) If you like pizza and wings and have a few drinks or just a family night yassss"}
{"text":"One of the sorriest examples of pizza I have ever had. Absolutely nothing about my experience was good. I wouldn't wish this so called pizza on my worst enemy. Take my advice, go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"First of all it took 1hr n 30mins for them to deliever my pizza, not to mention before I recieved my pizza I had to call them to check on an update and this is a hour after I placed my order. when the lady picked up the phone she had an immediate attitude. I asked her how long is it going to take for the pizza to get here she lied and said he was on his way then said wait a min and said never mind your pizza just came out I was like okay how long till he get here? and her response was IDK, do you want to pick it up yourself? then I responded no and asked her again for an estimate time and still responded with a \"IDK\" in a rude tone I get it they might have been busy but customer service was awful. Pizza was great!! but they need to work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza along with chicken fingers and cherry Pepsi and my grandma went to go pick up the order and an Asian lady that works there was rude to my grandma we been going to this place for years and this is how we get treated poor customer service won't be going back."}
{"text":"Irvin is my favorite!!!! He has such a great attitude and always smiling when he delivers my food or greets me at the store. Carlos is also the best wing cook ever !!! Not to mentioned their crispy fries with just enough salt !! I buy the 5 wing combo at least once a week!"}
