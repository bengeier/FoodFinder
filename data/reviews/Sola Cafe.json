{"text":"I love this super cute and quiet cafe.

I work just a block from them about once a week and I ALWAYS pick up food from them.

My favs: tuna croissant sandwich & Teriyaki Chicken Rice Dish
For a treat: Strawberry, Banana, Chocolate Crepe

The staff here is so friendly, they always make my food just how I like it.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I like Sola. I work near by, so I eat there at least once a week.
The staff are super wonderful and charming. The crepes are affordable and delicious. They pull fresh muffins out of their oven every morning, and they are also fantastic. They have great lunches- Teryaki Chicken Rice Bowls, Miso Soup, Croissant Sandwiches, etc. and they make many different types of lattes (and indulge in latte art on occasion.)

The only thing to remember when coming to Sola is that they are NOT a starbucks. They make everything from scratch, so you're looking at a 10 (sometimes 15) minute wait for a crepe or even fancy drink. In my opinion, it's worth the wait, but sometimes it's quicker to make the trek to starbucks for a muffin and espresso."}
{"text":"Sola serves it up with sandwich, soups and salads but it looks like mostly their speciality is crepes.

Not much to say about the interior but it is clean , and a haphazard of generic tables and chairs, the mirrored walls are lined with flowing curtains, I am not sure if this is trying to make the place look more elegant, for me it just looks silly

It is an order at the counter kind of deal but they have good pricing and the novelty of this place appears to be the sweet and entree crepes. You can get your ham and cheese, ham and egg, egg omelette, tuna salad, egg salad, smoked salmon, turkey, salt and pepper chicken, teriyaki chicken, and shrimp and avocado.  That pretty rare huh, all of these are stuffed in the crepe.

Then for desert crepes lemon, sugar, apple cinnamon, banana chocolate, banana almond, strawberry chocolate, strawberry banana chocolate, and peach ice cream.

So all in all a simple casual place to dine with friends where you don't have to dress up yet you get some exotic choices on entree and dessert crepes. Or you can simply come sola!"}
