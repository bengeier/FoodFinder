{"text":"We had a delivery order of six Lo Meins (3 chicken, 2 veggie, and 1 beef), an order of General Tso's Chicken, and their Jade Dumplings. This order was intended to feed 7 adults but easily could have fed 12 adults. The food was delivered hot in nice take-out packaging. We found the Lo Meins to be fantastic, with great flavor, noodles that didn't turn to mush, and fresh vegetables. The only drawback was the price, but given the quality, I wouldn't think twice from ordering again. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love Noble House! They are pretty expensive but they deliver! Their food is really good. The portions are large too. I normally order one dish then split it into 2-3 meals. Much better than pizza when you don't want to cook or go out to eat!"}
{"text":"I love Noble House. First of all, this place is NOT as obscenely expensive as everyone seems to claim. Knee-jerk reactions. Ask yourself how many times and how many different Chinese places you've tried... and how average they mostly all are. Now ask yourself if paying an extra $3 bucks per entree would make it worth it to actually get REALLY GOOD Chinese food -- to actually get what you \"tasted\" in your mind when you said to yourself, \"I think I'm in the mood for Chinese.\" I work in Hudson and eat lunch here all the time. Myself and a co-worker, entree and split a side of egg rolls, we're out the door for $30.00 combined; app, entree, drinks, tip. I'd rather pay $30 for guaranteed great Chinese food than $25 for the same old average fluff. I recommend the black-pepper chicken.  And by the way, the atmosphere is great and the people are extremely welcoming."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service!!  One of the best!!  The scallion pancakes are crispy and not greasy.  Really have to try them!"}
{"text":"We found this place during our stay at the Inn at Brandywine Falls. Didn't expect to be surprised with the quality of food. Its a little pricey for the area but worth the money if you like Indo-Chinese cuisine. This place is in-line with Nanking restaurant in Jersey City, NJ minus the red interior.  We ordered appetizer, soup and two dishes. We left pretty happy. Will visit this place if we are in the vicinity again."}
{"text":"Great food, we live close by and this has become our weekend Chinese fix.  The food is great, I would recommend Mongolian Lamb, it was one of the best I have eaten. We also are big fan of Chicken Satay. Service is great as well, they are quick and often the owner drops by to chat. Great place, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Look, this place is CONSISTENT and good. Don't expect super authenticity-- it's Americanized Chinese (obvs.), and it's not el cheapo like most Chinese joints. But damn if they don't have the most delicious sesame chicken I've ever had in my life. Perfect sauce, not too heavy, perfectly fried. Yes forever.  And the portions are huge, so the $25 you're paying for appetizer + a large entree is going to feed two normal-sized people. I promise. Also, get the spring rolls! YES."}
{"text":"Noble House is the best Chinese food I've had in the area.  Each ingredient tasted fresh and the dishes are high quality- you'll know what I mean.  We had the chinese pancake and spring rolls for an appetizer, egg drop soup, sesame chicken, and a beef with portobello mushroom dish.  I recommend all of them, especially the chinese pancake and the sesame chicken!  You can order the entree in \"small\" or \"large\"- small is definitely big enough to satisfy, so don't worry!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a full 5 stars, but I've got to wonder about a restaurant that overcharges us on 4 out of 5 small plates we ordered.  I wonder if they do this on a regular basis?  I wonder if they get away with that more often than not?  Let's pull a fast one and see if these wealthy Hudson people even notice.  4 out of 5.  That's just wrong.  They charged us for the large plates when we made it clear we wanted all small plates.  Wow.  They blamed it on the cash register.  They got the manager to \"fix\" things.  I don't think I want to go back, even if the food is good."}
{"text":"Why oh why is Chinese food always so expensive? Do they need to fly their food in directly from China in order to call it Chinese food?  And THIS place is some of the most expensive Chinese food I've ever had.  For the price I should have walked away saying \"That was the most amazing Chinese food!\"  But no.  It's good.  But tastes just like most other Chinese restaurants.  Didn't love it enough to dish out that much cash again for this place.  If I must have Chinese food, there are other places in town that are just as good and wont fleece my wallet quite as much."}
{"text":"Carry out order was hot and ready when I arrived - hostess was helpful and very friendly. No to go menu for lunch, only dinner. Chicken Satay was flavorful and enough for two portions - $9 lunch/$15 dinner. Spring rolls are 2 to an order for $5 and while crispy and delicious they are a tad small for price. Dining room looked lovely and I will def order again. $28 for two ppl makes it a payday treat."}
{"text":"Noble House used to be worth the extra $ compared to other Chinese places but my wife and I ate here a couple weeks ago and we were very disappointed in the food.  We started with dumplings which were OK and for entrees, I had kung pao chicken and my wife had sesame chicken.  Both dishes were very salty (extra MSG a la Kramer on Seinfield?) and didn't appear to have been prepared-to-order.  Chicken wasn't best quality  It had been a couple years since we had visited Nobel House and we were excited to go but came away with opinion that we will probably never go here again, considering food quality is same as other Chinese places but costs are 50 to 70% higher.  Oh well at least we gave it a shot."}
{"text":"This is in a small town in rural America with no real local source of Chinese ingredients, spices, vegetables, or meat, and its clientele is mostly not Chinese. So ... what can you expect.  It is not authentic, which may be a good thing.  I recently took an older couple who used to live here to a real Chinese restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area. Instant loss of appetite when we were served chicken feet.  You won't get that here.    Soy sauce is strange, sweet and sour not quite, and the sauces for everything very dark and heavy. Spring rolls are shredded spinach, gyoza may be frozen, and the servers have no real concept of Chinese food (nor the language).  The managers are Chinese though.  Saying this is Chinese food is like saying Taco Bell is authentic Mexican. Even the Panda is more authentic.  Then again, service is western and is fantastic.  Tablecloths and cloth napkins, attentive refilling of water. It is elegant, and for the local non-Chinese, it works. We would take our non-Chinese friends here for an elegant evening. For authenticity, go to Kent or Cleveland."}
{"text":"Dine In Review  Have been there several times over the last 3 months and this is hands down the only competitor to Chins in the area.  House made sauces and dumplings and desserts come at a price... just like a soft serve cone from McD's is cheap for a reason... comparing the Noble House prices to 99% of the Chinese takeout places in the surrounding communities is comparing mass market food service fare to real food.  Beijing Ravioli (large) - nice mix of spices and veggies in a delicate wrapper... nice dipping sauce... slightly spicy... just right for 2 people.  Walnut Shrimp (small) - large plump shrimp, perfectly steamed broccoli and a generous portion of candied walnuts... the best version of a buffet staple done right.  General Tso Chicken (small) - generous zucchini wedges and wonderful broccoli made for a very veggie intensive spin on a cliche dish... light breading on the LARGE pieces of chicken that were moist and flavorful... hubby was in heaven.  Brown rice was a nice option... both entrees were perfectly sized... no leftovers... not really hungry... but...  There was a book club of 12 or so people at the LARGE round table next to us and they were ordering desserts when we were nibbling on our dumplings... the young wait staff was having trouble putting words to the \"Fried Milk\" option.  Hubby and I giggled at their attempts to describe the confection and quietly decided it must be some form of coconut milk jello/custard that we have gotten at Dim Sum houses around the country... so we took a deep breath and decided to give it a try.  My word was it large!! Each spring roll size confection contained a creamy custard that was in no way egg-y... arrowroot? agar agar? something \"different\" was used to bring together cream into a pudding / jello shot / something that got lost in the heavy chocolate dipping sauce... but would have been perfect if we had been a large party.  First time I have ever taken home dessert leftovers from a Chinese place :-)!"}
{"text":"Damn, this place is pricey!  I'm a wealthy airline executive and I usually don't say that. At least for the price they deliver on quality, tasty food and attentive service.  Walking in we didn't know what to expect.  We were inundated at the entrance with lots of people but they were all waiting for take away orders.  Restaurant had two dining rooms and was immaculate, clean but still very empty, seems most just grab and go.  The place settings were almost too fancy, unless unbeknownst to us they could have been waiting for Her Majesty the Queen.  The main attraction was the high quality food. Every item was prepared perfectly.  Even the one item we had as left over was tasty the next day.                Their shrimp and asparagus dish was delicious, as was their sesame chicken.  Finally a local restaurant that serves the sesame chicken how it should be: quality pieces of chicken with a mild sauce.  How about they packaged new rice for us to go.  You pay for quality, but it's also restrictive, as this isn't the kind of place you can frequent once a week."}
{"text":"Fantastic food here. I had the best wonton soup ever. The spices in their food are just right. Also had the fried banana wonton with coconut ice cream --- unbelievable!"}
{"text":"We pick up from Noble House every other week.  It is always fresh, perfectly cooked and tastes great.  The service is excellent.  If you are in the mood for Chinese, you can't lose at Noble House - great food, and great service."}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese food. We used to think House of Hunan was as good as it gets in Summit County, but Noble House surpasses it. The sesame chicken - oh my God. Always get take-out, never eaten in, but take-out is always quick and ready when we get there. We don't even care that it's a little more expensive than average - it's that good."}
{"text":"They have this coconut shrimp dish that is to die for. We're going back with friends in a few weeks. Can't wait."}
{"text":"I don't get why people love this place.   I always hear it called \"continental Chinese\" or \"fusion Chinese\", but the menu was pretty much the same as any Chinese restaurant.  Everything we had was good to even very good (for the eggplant), but nothing was that special.  And at twice the price of what I'd pay in a neighborhood Chinese restaurant, I expect a lot more.   I don't see any reason I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place is good, just kind of overpriced for the quality. They take your average Chinese dishes and serve on fancy chipped plates, lol. The best thing this place has going for them is the fat lucky cat you can pet in the entryway. Won't be back anytime soon, the service could use some help, rude and rushed."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and I agree with them regarding the food is American Chinese.   It was a pleasant experience,  the decor was bordering fancy,  food choices and wine choices were good.   I had the small order of my entree and I thought both the price and quality of the food was good.  I didn't think it was pricey.   Overall,  I would have given them 3.5."}
{"text":"Every time my family eats here we are not disappointed.  We have tried numerous dishes and all were excellent.  The food here is much higher quality than your average Chinese restaurant.  We never feel rushed and always leave here feeling relaxed. This restaurant is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Great service. Food a little expensive for Chinese food, but good."}
{"text":"I dined here as part of a big group and we ate family-style, so I got to try lots of dishes. While the Crab Rangoon, Spring Rolls, Genera Tsao's, and Green Beans were just ok, the Chicken Lo Mein was above average.   But what really went above and beyond my expectations were their Beef and Portobello Mushroom dish and their Eggplant dish. Phenomenal! The depth of flavor in both of these made me savor every bite and come back for seconds. I live a good 40 minutes away, and I would come back again just for those two dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, generous helpings, beautiful (as we first eat with our eyes)."}
{"text":"We tried Noble House tonight for the first time. We decided to eat in rather than take out. The service was very good, but the food was just okay. We ordered the vegetable spring rolls and wontons as an appetizer, neither of which I would recommend. For our entrees we had the general tso chicken and sesame chicken plates. Both of these were good but not great. Would like to try more items on the menu!"}
