{"text":"awesome! The strip steak was just wonderful. Their house wine is great... forgot to ask what brand it was (chardonnay)"}
{"text":"Blackened salmon was hot and delicious. Chicken was hot and a large portion. Waitress was attentive and refilled drinks in a timely manner. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Visit to the 70's with a well chilled salad, but an equally chilled dinner roll.  In fact the roll didn't warm up enough to be edible the entire meal.  We were seated right away, waited about 5 min to be served on a day when there were only 2 other groups in the whole restaurant.  The food wasn't too salty... or too hot... or too cold... or too anything... it was an average offering from the 70's... LOTS of sauce... bordering on bland... but not really anything memorable.  The lighting is VERY dark even on a sunny afternoon, the bill took forever to arrive, we didn't finish and really weren't interested in trying to salvage any of it for left overs.  There are posters advertising patio events and even live music, but I wouldn't want to see what the service was like if there were more than 3 tables filled."}
{"text":"First time here, was seated quickly about 7:30 pm on a Sat.   Came to hear the band.. The band Harlow was good not too loud for the small room.  Best meal I have had in a long time, very tasty. Smotherd BBQ Chicken with Station Potaoes and a salad. The 2 of us both had this, and we both loved it.  Yes the dinner roll was cold, but alot of restaurants serve them that way.   Cara our server was great, even after we eat our dinner and were just having drinks. She was asking if we needed refills before they were empty.  My brother and his family come here often."}
{"text":"Ruined my Grandma's 80th birthday.  We scheduled a planned party here to eat in the actual train.  The restaurant printed nice menus with my  Grandma's name on them and had colored napkins - we were at first impressed.  Then the service and the food.  Apparently since we were 1 or 2 people under 30 (the apparent cut-off) we were only allowed to have 1 waitress.  We barely saw her.  When she was with us, she was too busy with everyone else in our party's needs to remember ours.  She forgot everything, was obviously needing help with AT LEAST one additional server, and it was just a disaster.  3 of our meals were unsatisfactory, including my grandmother (the birthday girl)'s steak.  She ordered it medium rare, and it came out well done and so thick she could barely cut through it.  While we had a wonderful night celebrating my grandma, and the train car was a cute idea, I doubt any of us will ever be back to this place."}
