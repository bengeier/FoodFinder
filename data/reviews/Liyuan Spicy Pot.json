{"text":"Wife wanted to try the place so we went. It's not a all you can eat hot pot place so for those of you thinking aYCE can go elsewhere. We ordered a pot of beef. Not much choice and fairly expensive. The near are also not raw like normal hot pot places. Soup was nice though. Don't expect raw eggs and the multiple kinds of sauces. It's a completely different setup. We ordered one pot with the beef and the price came to around$50 with tax and tips plus one side piece of beef and vege"}
{"text":"Tried the recommended lunch menu. Ordered the rice noodle soup with beef & the rice noodle soup with fish (sour and spicy). The fish soup is tasty but the beef one is bit off. There are a lot of beef tendon not enough beef meat. And the beef soup does not have enough flavor. The best dish was the free appetizer (cold radish). It was bit sweet, bit spicy. I was very attempted to ask for another plate... I saw most people coming to this restaurant for hotpot, majority of them are in groups of 4+. I looked at the guys at next table, they seems had a good time, the chicken hotpot they ordered seems really delicious. Maybe I should try the hotpot next time..."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. We called for a reservation for 5 adults and one baby. We were given a four seater table. The order took more than 1 hour to arrive, we asked 3 times, apparently they don't have one thing in our pot and the waiter was suppose to ask for a substitute, but never came...... There was a six person table opened and we asked if we could go there (at this point there is nothing on our table), and they claimed that there is another group of 5 waiting. We were simply stunned by how bad the service was. The food, it's average at best. Avoid at all cost."}
