{"text":"Cheap drinks. Two great patios, front and back. Great sound for live shows, which is surprising given how small and subterranean the bar is. One of my absolute favourite bars."}
{"text":"The place has a rough punk vibe to it, but the crowd was old - the youngest there besides us were probably in their late fifties. The bartender was a bit rude, demanding that we tip him every drink instead of at the end of the night, and he very clearly made the wrong drink even though I asked for two simple ingredients. However, the drinks were fairly priced and tasted great. Since there wasn't a band playing that night, they had a projector aimed at the wall and it was playing an anime film, so that was really eye catching."}
{"text":"I lived pretty close to this part of St Denis in 2006-7 and it was one of my fave hangouts. 

This falls into the dive-bar catagory I guess but that great cos thats my favourite type...maybe its slightly overshadowed by the hipster orientated Rockette nearby upstairs but is a great place for some early evening boozing especially if you want to hear some 60' garage, and punk tunes.Then it picks up around 9/10pm with a variety of eclectic bands from surf guitar to jazz to punk/hard rock.

All the regular beers on offer at decent prices and discount shots too."}
{"text":"It's just the best bar in Montr√©al if you are into punk, garage, psych, post-punk etc..."}
{"text":"while on vacation with my lady, we stumbled across this bar.  i heard live music and we had to go in. best punk rock bar ever! if you like loud fast music and cheap drinks, this bar is for you.  I'm planning another road trip just to make it to this bar again! the area is also very lively at night time."}
{"text":"Recently, this small punk bar did some renovations and added a larger stage, more seats and a lot more room in general. They also expanded their terrasse. They've basically expanded all the great things they used to offer and still have reasonably priced, delicious beers available. 
However, they have made one more important change. They have $1 tacos available on Tuesday. They're delicious. Sure, they're small and about all you'd expect for $1 but they're GOOD. Meat and veggie options are available and if you don't check it out you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic PUNK ROCK BAR in Montreal. Yeah, that's all that needs to be said. 

Friendly staff, stiff drinks, LOUD music. What more do you need, seriously?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer break while walking the streets of Montreal.  It's a pretty cool punk rock bar and they had a band playing mid afternoon on a Thursday.  We initially hung out at the bar to consume our adult beverages, but decided to hangout in the quaint patio as we people watched all the passer by's.

The bartender that helped us was cool and service food. There wasn't many people in at the time we went, but I imagine it gets busy during the weekend."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a beer, live music and server was cool. Big old stuffed animals and a bench. 

They took our drinks away as soon as they were empty and didn't ask if we wanted more. Small complaint but still great beer."}
{"text":"L'Esco has been a top choice for where my friends' band plays, and the atmosphere in there has a great vibe! It can get super packed and they do have a tiny stage, but nonetheless, people there are friendly, having fun and enjoying the music.

A lot of great bands tend to roll through there, and drinks are decently priced.  If my own apartment would have an extension where it was kinda cave like, yet felt super comfy, it would L'Esco."}
{"text":"Just a tiny bar built of big grey stone half sunk beneath St Denis. Small smokers terrasses in the front and the back bookend a room with fast friendly bartenders, cans of PBR for $5.25, and a tiny stage with big sound. Ok, so the ceiling in the back drips and the joint gets crazy crowded quick, but if you love local music and no-fuss bars, add this to your list."}
{"text":"Great bar and music venue for cool bands on St. Denis! Dimly lit, cheap drinks and good bar snacks. Came here with a friend for a concert and had a great time, only strange thing was that the average age was much higher than other bars I've been to in Montreal. I'm a college student and my friend and I were the youngest there by quite a bit. We tried the fries which were well seasoned and served with some sort of a spicy mayo based dip which went well with our beers. Overall, great place to stop by and have a drink with friends while listening to great music."}
{"text":"L'Esco is a cool, little dive bar. 

Upon my visit Friday night, this place was packed. Part of it had to do with a punk band playing inside to a large audience, the bar regulars sitting on the patio and striking a conversation with strangers, and a few selected musicians from the day's Osheaga festival dropping in for a pint. 

The vibe is cool and hip, a place to hang out and shoot the shit with your friends and meet new ones. It's a great place to people watch as the throngs of Montrealers walk up and down St. Denis bar hopping."}
{"text":"This place rules. Great small spot in a great location always full of great bands, with front/back patio, and nice layout. I always stop in here if walking past with no plans."}
{"text":"My go-to bar in Montreal. 
Dimly lit, crowded dive bar with cheap drinks - on Thursday night they have 2 for $5 shots of Fireball or something else. It's in the Plateau so it's typically a pretty hip, young crowd that comes here.
It also serves as a venue and a lot of punk bands come through and play here. And they have a DJ on Thursday night who plays a lot of old punk so that is a plus as well."}
