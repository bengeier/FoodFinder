{"text":"Great food at a great price! We really enjoyed the margherita pizza and mandarin almond salad! The place also has a very nice ambience - modern but comfortable! Would definitely recommend and well be back for Sure!"}
{"text":"If you love the pizza at Levetto, you'll like this place.   Food was very good and the portions were generous. My husband and I shared a salad and a Margherita pizza which were more than enough for the two of us. The pizza crust was thick but light and crunchy the way I like it and they didn't skimp on the mozzarella.   The restaurant is a lot more spacious than Levetto.l with plenty of seating and even a lounge area. There's a semi-private space in the back which would be good for a larger group.   Didn't get to try their pasta this time around but it's fresh made so we'll definitely be back to try it. Great value and great food in my opinion. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here as a group of six for a work lunch. I got the mandarin orange salad, two ladies got the mushroom pasta and two ladies had the small mushroom pizza.   Mandarin orange salad - I asked for a chicken breast $4 which was worth it. The salad itself doesn't really look like the advertised picture. It's literately a bed or roughly chopped romaine lettuce, some slivers of celery, couple of mandarin oranges from a can (wasn't fresh), and the almond slices came in two sugar encased clumps. Meh.  Mushroom pasta - the two ladies were raving about how flavourful and rich this dish was. Neither could finish, so that's a safe bet.  Mushroom pizza - unlike the pasta, this one was underwhelming. Portion size was small for $11. Neither of the two girls had anything fabulous to say while eating it. I didn't think it looked particularly appetizing either. Honestly Pizza Nova across the street is better value.   I'm baffled as to why this place is so popular. It's not the food. Must be the killer location and hipster decor. I won't return on my own volition."}
{"text":"Food is amazing , I always have such a great experience but there was a different cash person then the usual person ( the usual guy is Asian ) one time we went and we had bad service that day. So as long as the usual guy is there the service is amazing. The Norma pasta is amazing. And I don't understand why they won't add more chilli flakes while cooking the pasta ? The flavour becomes more intense when it is heated !!!!!!!!!!!!! It was also the chef that said no and that chilli flakes is on the side ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great chill vibe and unbelievable price for the quality of food. Try it now before the prices go up!"}
{"text":"One of the best \"bang for the buck\" hidden gems downtown. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars! Refreshingly casual format (self seat, self serve) but seriously good food for very reasonable prices. We had the brassato pizza, caprese salad and squid ink seafood pasta. Generous portions, solid flavours - the brassato pizza was outstanding in particular. Service was also very friendly - the owner(?) genuinely seemed interested in our experience when chatted on our way out. Will definitely be back and recommend to all."}
{"text":"Great value here.  Tasty pasta at a reasonable price.   Favourite items include Bolognese and Caprese Salad."}
{"text":"Their pizzas were so go, I had to order a second. Can't go wrong with the price, service, and environment. This is a perfect study spot aswell, with free wifi and the large space."}
{"text":"Tosto is an Italian restaurant which is a fast casual type that is pretty unique. It resembles fast food where you order first and pay at the counter, but the atmosphere is a casual setting. There is no service whatsoever but they do provide you with cutlery, condiments, and water for you to help yourself with.   The inside of the restaurant is really relaxed and comfortable. It's not a huge restaurant but there is plenty of seating available. They have sofas as well so that is a plus. When you step in, you take a menu and decide what you want to order then pay at the counter. They give you a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready.  On to the food. The food is really fresh and tasty. Their pomodoro pasta is absolutely delicious, with the sauce not being too sweet or too acidic. The pizza is also good too. The only downside is that one of the pizzas that we ordered was burnt underneath. Not severely burnt but it did add a bitter taste.   Overall, pretty decent place for Italian food. I would recommend their pastas since they are really tasty. I took off a star because my pizza was burnt and also their wash rooms need more tending to. They are pretty filthy to be honest but I won't let that take away from my experience too much."}
{"text":"Hidden gem -- Best fungi pasta I've ever had, and the brasato pizza blew my mind. My gf hates pizza in general, absolutely HATES it, and I told her to try a bite. She loved it. So you can imagine how good it was. Price was good for food quantity, and the food and place reminded me of levetto, but better."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh-made pastas, classy but self-serve makes the place great for families and casual fine dining. Their salads and pastas are perfection! Been there a number of times, always delicious."}
{"text":"The staff decided to open the door next to our table to 'increase ventilation'. Now keep in mind that its November in Canada - it was FREEZING outside. When we complained they decided to argue and repeatedly said its okay its only for 5 minutes. SERIOUSLY? do you know how cold it is outside? Food was completely bland as well so definitely never going back."}
{"text":"probably my top pick for food spots close to home.  it's tasty, the space is nice and cozy and did i mentions it's tasty?! if you love fresh pizza and pasta this should be your go to spot. the norma pasta, funghi or margherita pizza, and cesar are our families order of choice."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant . Their pasta is very unique and good size.  Services is good.  We order Funghi, Nero and garlic bread.  The pasta taste just right on, not greasy.  Only thing is waiting time as they cook one by one.  As long as not in rush,  we love this restaurant and for sure will come back."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I enjoyed the variety of different food items from unique pizzas and pastas.   The prices are reasonable esp for the quantity you get. Quality wise is alright. We had the carbonera and a pizza with apple slices.   The carbonera, took like 15 min to come out, and tasted more like an asian stir fry version of carbonera. Wasnt that rich in taste nor tasty tbh.    Pizza was alright too. Idk what I was expecting but it didnt knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now, food is simply amazing. Just get take out though because service starts and ends at the register. Can't stress enough how good the food is, though. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"I went to this place a couple of times and I have to say I always had a good experience. Of course I'm not expecting gourmet Italian food but for the price, the area and the business model of this restaurant the food is excellent! Funghi come crostini all the way every time I come here, also last time I ordered from here through U we eats I had the pesto pasta with chicken, which for my surprise (pesto and chicken I wasn't sure) it tasted really good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic dinner of course -it's more a Order and grab eat here/out type of business but for lunch, a snack or some Italian food while discussing a new project with a work colleague is perfect! Also they have aranciata San Pellegrino: my favourite!"}
{"text":"I love coming here!   I have been coming here for awhile now to the point that the staff knows my order since I order only one item.  I love the empty space, great wifi, and the decor!"}
{"text":"It is a new place. There food feels fresh and healthy. I trued their pizza and pasta both were perfect. A good choice if you want to try something quick and light."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant that offers takeouts as well. They have a unique style, especially when it comes to pizza, so it's definitely worth trying out.  I'd recommend Brasato or Prosciutto pizza as well as Pollo pasta."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Tosto. Atmosphere was casual and family friendly. We loved that. It was a little odd and confusing at the beginning... Because you have to line up to order first and then you get a call when ur food is ready. We ordered the pizza... It really wonderful! Dessert ( truffle royale) was Devine! It melts into your mouth. My husband who doesn't like dessert... Finished every little bite. I would give it a 5 star but there was no water at our table and it was really annoying trying to carry your glass back to the front to get it refilled. It would be great if they provided those Italian glass bottles at each table. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I actually felt compelled to create a yelp account after my experience here. I had no expectations one way or the other before I entered the restaurant.   We ordered our food when we first walked in -as this place is a semi-serve yourself kind of place. Personally not a fan of this set up. When go out for a meal I would prefer full service.   The food came in a respectable time frame. However, for a place that prides itself on making pizza, it fell quite flat. The pizza sauce was just plain marinara, my pizza had almost no toppings, the crust was puffy and bland. This was the McDonalds of pizza. I could have gone to the metro next door and quick fired up a better frozen pizza.   If you have tastebuds and consider yourself a foodie, skip this place. If you want a place to bring your kids, it's moderately priced and seems quite family friendly. Yet another lack lustre restaurant in Leaside."}
{"text":"Long over due, just been busy enjoying food at better places.   Considering the price of dining, this place is well over priced and the food is a five out of ten. Service starts and ends at the register. So don't tip. You don't tip at McDonald's. Restaurant with no refills..? Again the price of pasta is too high for mediocre food alone, you think you could at least wash it down...   The only take away is that parking is ample and the place is empty and quiet. Good for conversations And unwinding. Great for a first date."}
{"text":"Tosto Quickfire Pizza Pasta is a fast-casual restaurant serving freshly prepared \"scratch-made\" pasta & \"authentic\" Romano pizza in an open kitchen. The place has a loft feel and is spacious. I also appreciate the contemporary design, with a touch of Italian flair. It has a tasteful industrial look with punches of orange.   Tosto has fast and friendly service. Since I have been to Tosto a few times now, I have sampled several of their pizzas.   Brasato: This pizza has braised beef, mozzarella, sunny-side egg, mushroom, cherry tomato, arugula and béchamel sauce. It has nicely braised beef and the addition of a sunny-side egg gives a perfectly balanced flavor combination.   Patata: This is my favorite pizza on the menu, which includes potato, sausage, mozzarella, sun-dried tomato, rosemary and béchamel sauce. This pizza has such a fabulous flavor although there are a minimal of ingredients in this pizza.  Umami: This is another favorite of mine. With green apple, mozzarella, caramelized onion, red onion, black olive, walnut, pecorino and béchamel sauce, this pizza gives an authentic umami experience. When you combine these ingredients containing these different umami-giving compounds, this pizza offers flavor points than the sum of its parts.  All their pizzas are made with a thin crust and they always serve their pizzas crispy. Every time I visited Tosto, their dishes were consistent and provided a same level of quality. Overall, Tosto is a great place for a quick meal on a reasonable value. Since this place is closer to my home, I am sure to return to fill my pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Affordable price for handcrafted pizzas and fresh made pasta. Highly recommend their Carbonara, Prosciutto pizza, and Sicilian pizza."}
{"text":"I decided to try the traditional favorite - Bolognese pasta. I was not disappointed. It was delicious and tasty with meaty sauce. Not too much to overwhelm the linguine. I really enjoyed it! I haven't had pasta like this since I was in Italy last year! Service was friendly and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. Ordered takeout for pickup from their menu: Manzo Pasta and a full-size order of Panzanella Salad. Pasta was fine, but the salad was laughable. Halved cherry tomatoes and 6 pieces of croutons. That's it. None of the advertised capers, black olives, basil or green onions.  So yeah, it wasn't a salad. It was leftovers. I'd like to think it was a mistake, but seriously?  Tosto's largely empty during the day and evenings. Maybe this is a sign of things to come?"}
{"text":"This place opened last year on Bay St just north of College. I have heard some colleagues at work talking about it and was receiving mixed types of comments, finally I decided to try it since my insane passion for any type of Italian food. I walk through the giant orange door and suddenly I am in front of some typical Italian poster: tomato sauce cans, a burning oven with pizza forks caressing the fire but also a slice of modernity all around. The decor is very modern. One area is elevated, where you can seat to dine in and the entrance where you can order take out and wait on one of the chairs. Then the food: I had funghi crostini: delicious and delicate, spaghetti with tomato sauce - I like to appreciate the simplicity yet rich taste of the pasta. I have to say: I was impressed! I definitely recommend this place. Ps: they are fast too."}
{"text":"Was in town from Chicago and had dinner at Tosto. Great food and service as well. I have eaten at the Tosto in Leaside and the food is always fresh tasting."}
{"text":"I go to Tosto on Eglinton  a couple of times a week or at least once a week. I eat out a lot and love the general ambience of the place and as a solo diner the staff is friendly and eating alone is  a  totally OK thing. The Umami pizza is excellent when it is very well baked . Also they have a delicious pasta with tomato sauce good portion size and consistently filling.More non meat dishes  on the menu would be ideal or fish dishes for us who choose not to eat red meat."}
{"text":"Bolognese and funghi pasta at $10 a plate made the house-made pasta extra delicious!  1/2 price drinks during happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"get the bolognese, caesar salad and garlic bread. Latte's are great too!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and we had the prosciutto pizza and garlic bread. The garlic bread did not taste garlicy at all, just a slight olive oil flavour. Pizza had a thick crust and was tasteless. Staff was slow and did not really care. We were the only ones in the store, guess why. We will never come back, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Every time I've been I liked it but never loved it. I recently went again and I ordered the puttanesca pasta- squid ink linguine with tomato sauce, anchovy, sopressata, tomatoes, capers and black olives... was a bit skeptic at first about the mix. Their portions are big and excuse their prices, and I was ready to bring back home half of my plate. To my great surprise the pasta was amazing, it was in just the right amount of sauce, right amount of spice and most importantly well cooked. Only weird thing is when I asked for water all they had to give me was hot water from a kettle. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"For a quick order and pick up place I wasn't expecting much but this place really surprised me.  I shared the carbonara pasta and brosata pizza.  The pasta was on point. Not too salty or saucy and it was a healthy portion size. The pizza crust hinted at a Pizza Hut but was way better. Lots of seats. Clean. Highly recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"The eat-in side of things is not the most efficient. You walk in, and there is no seating hostess. You have to order your food by lining up in the tiny waiting area, grab a little beeper and wait until it beeps and you pick it up from a counter. It's very easy for anyone to just grab someone else's order. Then you try to take a seat in a crowded area with communal tables where inconsiderate folks take up 5 seats for 2 people (because their jackets and purses are supposedly eating too). Like, what is this circus act? Food was subpar. Will not return."}
{"text":"I tried Tosto for the first time tonight on Ritual. Peggy was so friendly and accommodating. She made my flavourful and delicious funghi pasta and offered great recommendations. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The place is usually OK, however feels like they have recently changed management and the service became significantly slower and unpleasant. For example, we dropped by on October 21 dinner time (2 families)... the place was dead (4 diners) before ordering they alerted us that they are \"crazy backed up\"... with take-out orders, thus we shouldn't expect food to come out in the next 40 min! Although we though it was excessive, we decided to order. 30 seconds into the order we asked to switch the pasta souce for the kids from red to white (request that was always granted in the past with no issues). This time they decided that they can't do it. Needless to say that we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting cafeteria-style concept:  Walk in, put your order through at the cash, receive a buzzer, sit down at a table and wait for your buzzer to beep to pick up your food.  With little to no table service, the review comes down to the food.  Had the prosciutto pizza the first time around, which I was disappointed with because the prosciutto and arugula were added on before putting in the oven, wilting the greens and crisping the prosciutto (my personal dislike, but that's totally subjective).  Wish the cashier had let me know sooner that they usually ask for your preference - you can get it placed on the pizza before OR after the oven.  Bah.  On a secondary note, the dough is a bit thick for my liking, but again that's just my personal preference.  I'd skip the puttanesca pasta, which for some reason smells like hay and tastes like a farm (it's probably just the squid ink pasta paired with the anchovies, tbh).  Instead, if you like mushrooms I'd recommend the funghi pappardelle which is creamy, rich, and tastes like button mushrooms making mushroom babies."}
{"text":"I came here roughly a week ago with my family for a late lunch. Everyone at the place was extremely friendly and welcoming. They have an open kitchen concept and everything was very casual.   My family ordered 1 starter, 2 pasta dishes and 1 pizza to share. For the starter we ordered Calamari, it's not the usual breaded squid, it was pan fried and then torched. For the pasta we got the Carbonara (linguine, egg yolk, pancetta, sausage, grana padano, parsley, garlic) and Aragosta (linguine, lobster, roasted cherry tomatoe, caper, chili flake, parsley, garlic). For the Carbonara, we found that the taste of garlic was overwhelming and it would probably be something that my family would not order again; however everyone loved the Aragosta pasta. For pizza we tried the Funghi pizza, and I absolutely loved it (maybe because I love mushrooms).  Overall, the experience at this restaurant was great. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ate the worst pasta in my life here... Ordered a Carbonara, it came with a thick uncooked udon noodle instead of linguine (which is whats supposed to be according to menu)... and the price was too high compared to the quality of food. Felt like I seriously wasted my money."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. It's quite short staffed here considering how busy it is but the food is always amazing and worth the wait. It's pretty cool how they have the open kitchen concept and you can watch your food being made!!    Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for baptism party. We ate the: calamari, Caesar salad, romana salad, carbonara, bolognese, margherita pizza, brasato pizza. My favorite was the brasato pizza! The braised beef, sunny side egg and wild mushrooms in it was delicious! The crust tasted really good! I normally don't eat Italian food because I find not too many places get the sauces right. But this place got all the sauces right in all the right ways! Atmosphere was warm and inviting. Decor is casual but also modern and homey. I love the long tables. Feels like I'm having a family meal with an Italian family!"}
{"text":"Comida maravilhosa! Sabor de molho de tomate de verdade. Música ambiente: Bossa Nova."}
{"text":"Good place to grab lunch with a group of colleagues but the wait is terrible. It's always busy and even a salad order can take up to 30 minutes. The food itself is very good and fresh, but not sure if it's worth the wait.   Price: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Ambience: 4/5"}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous place! The rustic feel to the decor, the beautiful hanging chandeliers, the floor to ceiling windows - there couldn't be a more beautiful place to grab a meal to go or sit in a absorb the decor.  I was fortunate enough to attend their media event and got to try quite a few of their dishes. I find the price to be very reasonable (~$10 for a pizza, ~$20 for a pasta) and the serving size is generous as well.  I really enjoyed their pizza especially the crust because right when I lifted a slice up, I knew. It was so light and fluffy yet crunchy on the outside and had a nice flavour to it. Even if you're not a crust person, save it up and make croutons! I had a few bites of the different pasta they offer (they make their own pasta in house!) and it was good but not as flavourful as I'd like.  Overall, this is a great spot for a meal. Super accessible, prices are reasonable, staffs are super friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant by my manager. Since then I have returned so many times and have introduced the place to many more people. The pizza and pasta is amazing!! A must-try"}
{"text":"Great pasta! Didn't try the pizza. Awesome service, shootout Penny. Didn't take a picture, ate it too quickly"}
{"text":"pizza is excellent,,yummy and then some but the price and size of pizza not good paid just under ten dollars for what they call small it was not small or very small it was tiny ok if you are in high income bracket no free complimentary anything when i was there left starving and thinner"}
{"text":"We came here with cravings for some good pasta and maybe a pizza. Place had a great feel, it was modern with an artsy flare. Food came out quick and it was delicious. Pasta was cooked perfect and had a good balance of flavour. Pizza was thick crust and had a generous amount of toppings, oh and it is priced very reasonably. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came back here for lunch earlier this week and had their special - the lobster pasta.  It was amazing!  Hands down my favourite place for pasta and they were also very generous with the lobster.  It exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"No so great! Called ahead to place an order and arrived a 45 mins later to pick up and it still want ready. I waiting another almost 30 mins for a pizza and salad. The restaurant wasn't really busy either. The pizza was ok but not worth the cost or wait!"}
{"text":"There is a dearth of decent dinning spots in this area and sadly this place tries to fill the void and doesn't succeed. The setup is geared more towards a lunch crowd from what I could tell and has an open feel.  Anyway on to the main attraction we ordered a share size margerita pizza I had the Bolognese.  Mundane Pasta and pizza that tastes like frozen counterparts. The service is good which gives it a half star bump. It can be a decent choice over food courts if you are just looking for food as a filler. Otherwise keep on looking this area :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my least favorite \"Italian\" restaurant in Toronto. I went here twice on different occasions with colleagues before writing it off, but both experiences were sub-par to competing restaurants. I guess I should've known - any Italian restaurant that doesn't have true Italian chefs probably won't satisfy. I've tried both the pomodoro spaghetti and the pesce rigatoni. Both pasta dishes have been overcooked and clumpy, as if the pasta has been sitting out for too long.   The service is just about as good as the food - marginal at best. I asked for chicken to be substituted in the pesce sauce, but the kitchen was extremely unacommodating. Most Italian restaurants will happily substitute different meats, sauces, or vegetarian options - it's not that difficult! Overall, $17 + tax for a pasta dish here is so not worth when I could easily walk a few blocks to Scaddabush or take the subway to nicer places in the financial district."}
{"text":"Tosto. The finesse of slow-food prepared quick-fired. I came for lunch, returned for dinner, then made plans for a few days later. The dishes are cutting edge, but the prices take me back to the 80s. Dinner for two can be under $50. Front of house staff guide us through the menu, take our order and are all smiles. They know we are going to love our food. My favorite pizza out of eight on the menu (single, share, or group size) is Funghi with mushrooms, Pecorino cheese, sun dried tomatoes, béchamel sauce and a spritz of glorious truffle oil. Even the crust is delish! You won't see a crumb left on plates.  I'm working my way through the ten pastas: hearty Brasato which is rigatoni with tosto2 braised beef; polpette, the classic spaghetti and meatballs; traditional Puttanesca. Love 'em all. Next on my list is linguine with tuna and arugula. All the pasta is freshly made right here and cooked to order. And what a difference that makes in the flavor.  Here, Bay St. lawyers mingle with local condo-dwellers, the cops from HQ across the street, and passers-by who are discovering the charms of Tosto.  Antipasti include an Italian charcuterie board (at $14 it's the most expensive dish on the menu); calamari, crostini and more. And there are classic salads like Caesar and tosto3 Caprese that come as a side or a regular size. At the next table they are enjoying really generous Italian sandwiches.  An oasis in a wasteland. This stretch of Bay Street, between U of T and \"downtown\" is where, if you needed something good to eat, you would be s.o.l. Now, happy days, Tosto has opened its doors. Modern, easy going and a terrific pit stop."}
{"text":"Solid choice for take out in the neighbourhood. Dude behind the cash was super friendly, informative, totally willing to jump in to make the sale.  They have three sizes of pizza, we were sharing just two of us and so we chose the middle size, which works out to 3 pieces each.  We shared a pasta, too, and this made a good sized meal for two people and only $27.  I preferred the pizza - the crust was really good, and the toppings were great (funghi), but he preferred the pasta (carbonara).  Next time I'd want to try some other things, but I would certainly be back."}
{"text":"How is it possible that going to the same place in less than a week can result in such a different food experience?    The pasta was over cooked.  Not terribly, but definitely not al dente.    The pizza was barely warm.  The toppings (mushrooms) seemed kinda skimpy.  I have to take back my five star rating and replace it with a solid 3.  Sorry Tosto!  Consistency is everything and if 6 days makes this much of a difference, who knows how my third visit will end up!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I come here all the time... last night around 7:30 pm we (2 people) walked in to a mainly empty restaurant, apparently there was a private party in the back, the employee said \"hi we aren't taking anymore guests because we have a party in the back, I'm the only one working, I'm really busy and those people over there have been waiting for their food for over 30 min, thanks, bye\" and then she walked away. This is the SECOND occasion of me driving there and them telling me they are \"understaffed\" and can't take any orders. I even called ahead once and someone said \"we have a big order so we can't do any take-out for the rest of the night\". I've also seen them turn away people on a busy Saturday night...I guess they don't want customers?"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot if you work in the area. Conveniently located and a good amount of seating.  I had their truffle pasta - must say it was just ok. The pasta was a little overdone"}
{"text":"Great kid friendly place to eat with plenty of room for strollers. They have a kids menu which includes cheese pizza as well a very tasty butter pasta with grana padano. Our favourites are the Brasato and the Bolognese - very tasty and huge portions! I mean huge, usually my husband has a hard time finishing one portion.  Each dish is individually prepared fresh and our kids love watching them cook in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"I didn't want the pasta to be that good, but it is, so now I won't be able to pass by here without suffering the pangs of carb-longing. What have you done to me, The Norma? No wonder there were so many orders ahead of mine, and so many more after, too."}
{"text":"Their food is good for a self-serve italian restaurant. We ate here several times and found their food okay. If I work late and have no time to cook, I order take out as well. Our staples are the squid ink puttanesca, carbonara, funghi pizza and umami pizza. Sometimes they have a buy 1 get 1 50% promo which is great! The only suggestion I have for the owners is to change the front door. The restaurant always looks closed with the kind of door you have. This affects the perception of people. The door doesn't seem inviting and one cannot see nor feel the energy going on inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving pasta and came across this restaurant. It had a more casual vibe rather than restaurant serving you kinda thing (which isn't bad!) More of a chipotle, Starbucks, South st.burger kinda feel just cause people had their laptops out and everything was just casual.   We got carbonara, fungi and garlic bread. Their pasta was probably one of the best I've had (funghi). The portions were a lot more than it looked and was very filling. The total of the bill was $42 which was pricey to me since the vibe of the restaurant wasn't upscale, but my boyfriend said it wasn't bad. It was only after we ate I considered the price to be okay because of the taste and quantity. Overall, i loved the food  and I would go back with my laptop and relax with my pasta aha."}
{"text":"This Tosto location has been open for 2 years now, and it's really grown on me. If the prices were just a tad cheaper, I would definitely rate this five stars.  I remember grabbing a share-size pizza during their opening week and finding the dough and taste quite average. Since then, I've been back with friends and larger groups and have tried most items on their pasta menu, which are definitely a hit with me!  The pasta here tastes fresh and I especially enjoy the chewy texture of the spaghetti noodles. The tomato-based dishes used to be loaded with garlic, but I think they changed their sauce recipe recently as I am definitely feeling less garlic-y after meals.  My favourites: caprese salad (loaded with arugula which is a nice addition!), funghi pasta (very rich), and polpette (classic spaghetti and meatballs)."}
{"text":"I can't say I liked Tosto at all. The decor is really nice. There's lots of windows and the staff is welcoming. The staff behind the counter explained all of the pizzas in detail.   I really didn't like the actual food though. I don't know what it is, but in my opinion, the crust is not good. There's a certain flavour to it, can't quite put my finger on it, but it should not be part of pizza crust. It's too dense, too thin, not at all my favourite.   My friends and I started with a Caesar salad. Not my favourite dressing. It was almost too spicy. Maybe tangy is a better word, but it was just too over the top for my liking.  The pizza that I had appears to be no longer on the menu, but it was overloaded with crushed garlic. That was literally all I could taste. I tried to pick as much of it off as I could so that I could actually taste the other flavours. I ended up leaving over half of the pizza.   While I wanted to love this restaurant, I just don't. I won't be back. For the price, I will enjoy a sit down restaurant where I am actually waited on and will enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The portion size for pasta is pretty big, and the pizza is very good! Worth trying. One of the best pizza place I have been. Very light crust even though it's not thin crust."}
{"text":"Cam here during lunch hours and it was packed. That's okay, decided to order an italian sandwich and wait for a table. The sandwich was fine, but the reason that I'm giving it a 2-star rating is the time it took for the food to be ready. If you market yourself as a quick serve restaurant, it should not take you 30mins to prep a sandwich. It was a good thing that my friend and I chatted during the wait, but imagine waiting here alone for half an hour for your food!"}
{"text":"Funghi and Norma are my fave dishes. Took long to get food before so we'd get there 5 mins early to avoid the noon rush. New owners now and the wait is just crazy. I don't go anymore because... who gets a 2 hour lunch break?  Then they go and raise the prices, lessen the portions and make you wait even longer??? Yummy food but pass if on the clock."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place and it will be my last...I hate the cashier that took our order. She helped me experience bad customer service for the first time. Thanks honeybun. The food was decent btw"}
{"text":"This is a \"fast casual\" restaurant; it does not offer table service but the quality of food is much better than your average fast food restaurant. They offer the typical Italian fare - pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and salad - with meals for one ranging between $8-$13. I use the term \"for one\" loosely when it comes to the pastas, which could easily be shared. The pizzas are the perfect size for lunch. Everything is plated nicely and looks great. I had the pasta fungi which was creamy, delicious, and authentic tasting although a little heavy on the caramelized onions.  While I appreciate the attempt to personalize the service, the calling out of names to signal order readiness does not seem to work during the busy hours. It was a little disruptive and seemed to result in worker frustration when customers couldn't hear their name being called. All things considered, a wonderful place to go for lunch or a quick meal."}
{"text":"Came here as a group with a bunch of vegetarian insta bloggers. We made a note beforehand that we are all reviewers and we will all be taking pictures of the food and sharing them on social media.   That being said, we got really bad service. The people in the front wasnt being helpful on what to do. No one gave us clear instructions. Apparently some of us were supposed to get buzzers, but only maybe 2/11 people did.   They also totally forgot about one order, and when we finally reminded them they mentioned how the sauce in that pasta was finished. We had to remind them twice.   If this was a full house, I would understand. However we were the only ones there lol.   The food however was really good. Pasta was made in house. And there was alot of variety. There wasn't alot of vegetarian options, but there was space in some of the meat options to pick and pull. I would say I still like the pasta at competition such as Scaddabush a bit better.   Prices were fair about 15$ per bowl, however the quantities are huge. The place was really nice and beautiful, but it was dead for a Friday night."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly very content with my visit here. I never really venture to many Italian restaurants because it's either poor-woman life Pizza Pizza or lavish-spending life Scaddabush (or such equivalents). This was my first time at a crossover mid-tier \"order at the cashier and seat yourself but food is still served in ceramic dishware\"-type restaurant.   I came with a friend on a Saturday so we shared the weekend brunch Salmon Eggs Benedict as well as an order of Calamari. Both were delicious!!! The hollandaise sauce was so creamy and perfectly complemented by the little twig of dill, and I really enjoyed that the muffins were paired with a light arugula salad and baked baby potatoes that were well seasoned. The calamari dish was probably one of the better ones I've had. The rings were large, tender, and very fresh. I don't usually like capers but I couldn't really taste it in the sauce because it was infused with a mixture of other flavours that were more overpowering and delicious. Note: there was also a drizzle of a slightly spicy sauce, one that to me resembles Japanese spicy sushi sauce, but it was just a light kick and totally acceptable by my spice tolerance.   The atmosphere was very modern, the tables were clean, the interior was well-lit by the enormous floor to ceiling windows, and overall, the meal was well worth its price! I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Great informal place. You order and pay before you sit which is great for people wanting to pay separately without it being awkward. Pasta was great. Went on a day that kids ate free which was a major bonus!"}
{"text":"The counter service is quick and polite. The decor is lovely and the music is great.   The Romano salad: a generous portion (regular $9) but lacking in flavour. It is dressed with a citrus balsamic vinegarette. You could not taste the balsamic at all - only the heavy olive oil they used. When we asked for extra balsamic to touch up the flavour we were handed some premixed dressing that was mostly olive oil. It needed less greens and more of the other veggies.   Brasato pizza (single $9): definitely a good bang for your buck. It was absolutely delicious. The crust was a bit thicker than I was expecting but I love thick crust so that was cool. It was perfectly cooked - tender dough, crispy bottom. This gem features a sunny side egg that was perfectly done. My only issue: it was covered with arugula so I had to go searching for my egg. The single size is more than enough for one person.   My dining partner had the funghi pasta ($14). A generous portion. The pappardelle was done just right. There was a pile of delicious mushrooms and just the right amount of sauce."}
{"text":"Nothing more to say than it's just not good food. The grilled chicken on the Caesar salad clearly came from a frozen Tyson bag and the pizza is a square cracker with store bought sauce. Seems like nice owners but Sorry."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner. Ordered the Nero which was the squid ink pasta. The portion was big which was great I had to take it to go! I replaced the pasta  with shrimp to a chicken which was still tasty and super flavorful. I asked for more cheese to go along with my pasta. They were super nice to have grate the cheese fresh on the spot for me!   The atmosphere was more of a laid back casual type of vibe. You order first before you sit down and is given a buzzer for you to grab food and return. The furniture and style of the place is modern and relaxing. I opted for a lounger couch rather than the traditional tables. Overall very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We ordered three vegetarian dishes and one PUTTANESCA without anchovy. The person who took our order later came to clarify that the PUTTANESCA has meat in it and wanted to make sure that we were aware and okay with it. We were very impressed with him. All of our dishes were delicious. We'd enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Tosto is a casual restaurant where you order your food over the counter and pick it up when it's ready.  Big portions and great tasting food for the right price.  The pasta and pizzas are fresh and tasty.  I recommend the funghi pizza.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Overall: 2.5/5 I heard really great things about Tosto, especially about their downtown location. When I found out that there was an Oakville location, I was super excited to try it out. Unfortunately, Tosto came up short for me in the taste department and I will not be back.   Taste: 2/5 I went with my boyfriend and we ordered the calamari to start, followed by our mains: carbonara and brasato. The calamari was alright, nothing special to rave about. My boyfriend didn't like this dish at all and he ended up eating everything BUT the calamari. He did mention that the arugula saved the dish. Moving onto our mains, I was really disappointed by my carbonara. Unfortunately, it was bland, dry, and cold. Needless to say, I had a difficult time finishing my plate. My boyfriend enjoyed his brasato pizza though. I had a few bites of it and wished that I had ordered a pizza instead.   Service: 3/5  Tosto is a self-serve restaurant. Patrons pay for their meal at the counter and receive a buzzer when their food is ready. We received the buzzer and chose to sit outside on the patio. Our buzzer actually didn't even light up and the staff who took our order ended up bringing our food and drinks to us. Some confusion when we finished our meal - seeing that they didn't go by the self-serve they had told us about for the beginning of our meal, we weren't sure if the staff would be bringing our empty dishes back and cleaning the table or if we were expected to bring everything back in. It was the latter. Overall, service was decent but not consistent.   Ambience: 3/5  Restaurant set-up is nice, with lots of space inside and some cool couch-style seats, and the option for patio as well."}
{"text":"The food is good but you have to consider if it is ethic to go and eat in a place where: they don't pay enough their employees, they always cut hours and the staff has to pay for their food even with 10 hours shift. The old manager was a gentleman but I'm not going to give my money to a business that exploits their employees."}
{"text":"I work nearby so have been meaning to check out this place for a while.  I finally visited this evening and found the atmosphere to be spacious, modern and inviting and the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful.  For 7pm in the evening on a rainy day, the restaurant was actually quite busy.  Dine-in guests order at the front, grab a seat and wait for their name to be called when their dish is ready.  Pastas/pizzas are all around $10-$13 a serving and there's also the option to order beer and wine.    I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro ($10) and found it to be quite tasty and the portions VERY generous! (I had to take some home because I couldn't eat it all).  Personally, I quite like the cafeteria-style service.  If this was a \"table service\" restaurant prices would probably be at least double + tip, but it's not, which makes it a great affordable casual dining option for the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night for a birthday. Was able to reserve a table for 13! Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Concept is cool and provides a laid back vibe. Tried the calamari, carbonara, and brasato pizza (share size, 8 pieces). All were delicious, the carbonara was a bit salty though. You get 10 pieces for the calamari. If they serve a pizza with thin crust oh man that would be great! Would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on black Friday after shopping at Vaughan Mills. It was pretty quiet in the restaurant which made it a bit sketchy. This is a self serve restaurant,  which I don't mind at all. So you order at the front cashier and get a buzzer. When the food is ready, your buzzer will buzz and you just pick it up.   That night, we ordered both of the squid ink pasta, nero and puttanesca, since it's not easy to find in Toronto. We also ordered polpette, the meatball, as the appetizer. I must say, the food is made on point. It exceeded my expectations. The Pasta was al dente. The seafood was fresh. The overall taste was delicious.   Because the Italian food here was so yummy, I was wondering why the restaurant wasn't packed. I finally underatood. I realized they had a lot of take out and delivery with ubereats, which makes so much more sense. I give this place two thumbs up! I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Came for a first and likely last visit. The decor and space was nice and the service was great. It's cafeteria style where you have to serve yourself with cutlery and then clear away your dishes after.   We got the polpette and the prosciutto pizza. The polpette was mediocre and had a slight freezer taste. The pizza was the better of the two but wasn't anything special.   Walked in because we like via cibo and thought this would be similar and closer for us but looks like we're sticking with via cibo."}
{"text":"Not feeling it. Cool place, but I could make something better at home (and I'm not a chef). Pizza was akin to the freezer variety, and the fish pasta (shoulda known better) was just the same. Frozen, reheated, served for a premium. Cool location with weirdly heavy doors? kind staff. Half bottles of wine for $14 were fun. The coupon we used had a typo and they honoured the BOGO for a pizza and pasta combo. I'd go to an authentic place that's right around the corner. No offence, but try to pronounce funghi even the slightest bit Italian, if possible! Fun-guy isn't very appetizing to the ear."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week, we ordered the fungi pizza, cheese bread & a Caesar salad to share. The food overall was very good, I would highly recommend the fungi pizza, the mushrooms were fresh and flavorful, and sundries tomatoes were a lovey touch. The geese bread was a big bland, good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The Caesar salad was a huge portion and very good! We split everything and packed up the Caesar salad and half the portion of the cheese bread, the price was also fantastic, for he amount of food we got the total was only 40$. I'd definitely love to come back to this place! The only thing is that I wish they had more vegetarian options (they currently have 3)   Definitely will be coming back however!"}
{"text":"Cute lunch spot. Prices are reasonable if a bit high. Food is decent. I've only had their pizza but there are salads and pasta. I've come here a couple times on lunch and it usually has seats. Takes a couple minutes for the food to be ready. You order at the front and then sit down u til your food is ready. It's got an upscale interior. The pizza is pretty and the atmosphere is nice but if you are looking for awesome taste, I wouldn't rank this in my top 5 or maybe even 10 pizza spots in toronto."}
{"text":"I frequent this area often, but did not know this fast-casual restaurant existed until my cousin recommended we go here for dinner. It's easy to walk past by, but I am glad that I now know that it exists!  After skimming the menu, we both settled on pasta - Norma for my cousin, Carbonara for myself - a single size of the Umami pizza to share, and two glasses of wine. After paying, we were given a buzzer and we would be given a ring once our food was ready. It was a quiet Tuesday night, so seats were plentiful and there was not much of a wait for our food to be ready.  The pastas ranged from $10-14, and were in generous portions; more than enough for a single serving, and enough to split to take home for later. However, put a plate of pasta in front of me and I will finish all (or most) of it! My carbonara came with generous portion of pancetta and sausage, and the egg yolk sauce was nice and creamy, without being overly creamy. The Umami pizza did not have the \"umami\" factor, as its name suggests, but was a nice complement to my pasta to dip in. Our wine didn't come in wine glasses, but in glasses that are probably the same glasses they use to serve water. I understand that it's fast-casual, but perhaps this is a bit too casual.  For around $50 for two pastas, a single size of pizza, and two glasses of wine, the value is excellent; simple, traditional Italian menu with fresh, made to order pasta and pizzas at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5/5   Pretty good place for simple Italian food. Ordered the margherita pizza (single), bolognese pasta, and calamari. I enjoyed the pizza because it had good taste and crunch, but I definitely wouldn't say it's the best margherita pizza out there. My boyfriend enjoyed the pasta. The pappardelle made it pretty filling because of the density of the pasta. The calamari was good too, I'm personally not a big fan or olives (which it comes with) but I just picked some of it out.   I would come here again. It's priced decently and the interior is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Had the pasta carbonara. Not recommended. Not very authentic. Need to try the pizza next time. Polpette (meat balls) were decent."}
{"text":"Came here the other night amd used a buy one pasta, get one pasta 50% off coupon.    I opted for the Norma pasta, which had a uniquely shaped noodle, and many veggies thrown in there, all topped with a rose sauce. My boyfriend got the bolognese, and ordered some meatballs as well (3 avg sized meatballs for $5). We were pleased with our pasta dishes, which says a lot considering we're both Italian. I especially liked the complimentary bottle of chilled water they gave us to take to our table, that's something that's very common in Europe.   Even though there was nothing wrong with our meals, I must say I dont think i would return if i didn't have another coupon.... The portion I received for the $14 list price was stretching it juussttt a bit. If you're willing to spend a bit more and get what I would consider to be a small portion for the price,  then it's surely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Meh. Tried out Tosto one night because boyfriend and I were too lazy to cook and wanted to try out something in the area we haven't been to before. Sad to say our whole meal was very \"meh\" - not the best pizza, calamari or salad I've had, and definitely not worth the price for a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a small plaza and it is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and an Italian dish. I really enjoyed their Nero pasta dish and the grilled calamari here. The Nero pasta had black ink linguine, shrimp, capers, garlic and was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed both seafood dishes and I was glad a friend recommended the place.  Don't expect full service at this restaurant though if dining in. You order when you come in and they provide a buzzer for you to pick up your order when it is ready. You also have to clear the dishes off the table yourself. But, the prices are reasonable, the ambience is nice and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped by Tosto last night for dinner and I absolutely love this place already! It was so delicious that I had to come back from my Yelp hiatus to write this review.   I was in and out pretty quick(fire!), but I still had a great time here. Upon entering, you will see a huge menu on the wall to choose a variety of different pizzas and pastas from. Then, you order from the cashier at the front and take a seat once you're done. I waited for about 10 minutes for my food, and the same cashier brought the dishes to me when they were ready. The service was pretty good compared to some of the other self serve restaurants I've been to. I got my own napkins and forks and had a nice but quick sit down meal. The restaurant is actually really nice inside - definitely not what I was expecting for a fast(ish) food kind of place. There are even couches to sit at instead of tables, which I love!   I would definitely recommend either the Funghi pasta or the Carbonara pasta! These are the only dishes that I've tried so far but they were both real good. Fresh, creamy, and super tasty. The portions are also a great amount for the price you're paying - I was quite full after my meal with leftovers for lunch the next day. I will surely come back to try some of the pizzas on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was in Oakville shopping and happy to see some good food choices starting to come around.     So finally a good pizza joint. Atmosphere was really nice. Good selection of pizzas. Service zero! Some stoned kid behind the counter rude and obnoxious  literally throws the beeper across the counter at us and says here this will beep when ready.  An then he goes back with the girl and chit chats and makes the  pizza. ( which I never seen him wash his hands)    As for the pizza. The Calabrese one I ordered was good. Very small but good. The one with braised beef wasn't good at all. They should've put the beef on before it went in oven instead of after because beef was cold.   So for 35$ two small pizzas and one not good at all and the rude kid made this a bad experience that I will probably not go back to. I should've just went to panago down  in the next plaza."}
{"text":"Great food overall but I've come here multiple times in the evening where they are closed way earlier than posted. It's a disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent place in Vaughan, as we discussed- it has a very downtown Toronto vibe but in Vaughan. The whole restaurant is laid out very nicely and the service was great from beginning to end.   They have an extensive menu with pizzas, pastas and salads. Very basic recipes but very traditional as well. Our whole yelp tribe had an excellent and truly delicious time. Atmosphere is very chill, not rushed at all and food came in a very timely manner.  We had: - mushroom and truffle pizza - 5/5 absolutely delicious, soft and crust was delectable. Truffle taste was just on point and mushrooms had great texture and taste as well. - soppressata - very good as well, this was more regular so I didn't find it that special but made very well still. 4/5  - calamari - great dish for sharing, healthy alternative and cooked to perfection 5/5 - caesar salad - okay, this was amazing. Very basic but y'know I love my salads. It's not just romaine, there are other 'leaves' in here as well.. not arugula but similar? 5/5 - braised beef rigatoni - HOLY PASTA 5/5 .. I don't eat pasta, pretty much ever but during cheat meal, I totally own it. it was delicious. Fresh pasta with great texture and the beef was soft and perfectly braised. OMG. - Lobster pasta - forgot the name of this. Very regular to me, lobster was spread in tiny chunks. Spicy and kind of oily? 3/5  The team had some cannolis at the end but I didn't participate. I guess it was good as I saw eyes roll back and only heard silence.  Overall a VERY good experience at Tosto and definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Food was decent, came out fast and has a nice selection of foods to eat!  Went there with some co-workers for a small lunch/celebration.  Got a Brasato pizza + Calamari.   Ordered through a cashier, sat down and waited for my name to be called out.  There is no servers/waiters, you get your own food and put the dishes away after you're done. For that reason, there is no tip required, which was nice (I guess?)  My biggest gripe was that the place was quite loud.  With the servers yelling your name, to the echo-y environment, I wasn't able to have a good conversation with the people sitting right next to me.  I did not see an egg on my pizza like they showed on the display screen while waiting in line, but the food was still good enough for me to enjoy what I had. To my surprise the calamari was grilled, not fried/breaded, which was a nice change of pace.  I think I still prefer my breaded calamari though :)  Overall, A good place to try, especially for a quick bite.  The food came out quite quickly which I was happy with.  Will come back to try their sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"Our boss recommended this place to us, my colleague and I. So we went out for lunch. She had the Carbonara pasta and I got the Funghi pasta, and garlic bread to share. The garlic bread and Funghi was delicious, but the Carbonara wasn't to my taste. Will definitely recommend their Funghi pasta and their garlic bread. Service was excellent, the woman who took our order and presented our food was always smiling and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late lunch/early dinner. The restaurant was empty and we were the only customers. They have a promotion starting at 5pm with Funghi pasta and Bolognese pasta for $10 (instead of $14 and $15 respectively).   The guy working there was very nice, giving us this discount even though we went at 4pm. I asked for more cheese on my Funghi pasta and I got 2 little cups of cheese on the side. Our pastas were prepared after we placed our order - they do not have pre-made pasta and reheat them whenever they have orders.   Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"Love it! Great for sit-in or take-out. Haven't had something on the menu yet that I didn't love and we've ordered out about 6 times already. Ingredients are all super fresh, menu items all look and sound amazing.   Current favorites: Nero squid ink pasta and potato pizza."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place for Italian cuisine in downtown! The price is just as irresistible as the pastas and pizzas. The way this restaurant works is that you order the food, pay, find a seat then pick it up when your indicator beeps. The bonus is not being obligated to tip, although I still did because the service and food were just so great."}
{"text":"The location itself is really nice. If you're looking for a casual place to eat that looks impressive this is definitely that spot. Incredibly tall ceilings and lots of open space. It's cafeteria style in which you order at the counter and pay and you receive a buzzer to come get your food when it's ready.  The pasta servings are generous and filling and so is the pizza. HOWEVER, I will say that for the pasta it's not anything better than what you can already make at home yourself if you have the time for a lot cheaper.  Wasn't blown away by the pizza but it's decent. Wasn't crazy about the one with the braised beef and runny egg yolk one. Apparently the funghi pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"An excellent place to go for lunch and dinner! My favourite dish is the Pasta Carbonara and the Patata pizza. Price is reasonable since you get an authentic Italian meal for a shorter serving time. Very excited to try the Prosciutto sandwich and Cacio e Pepe Pasta; I have heard many great things about the two."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with thin crust. This is a self serve restaurant. It gets pretty busy at lunch so be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta. One of my favorite spots. They have dope white sauce. Loveeeee their Funghi. Bolognese (the meat sauce one ) is great as well."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews on Yelp, and in search of something super casual for a Friday night impromptu Italian family dinner, I finally got a chance to check out Tosto.  It was kinda perfect for what we were looking for. The pasta was fantastic (we got Carbonara snd the Chicken Pesto) and the kids cheese pizza was a big hit.  I asked the waitress if the pesto was cream based and she said no its not so I ordered it. She ran out 5 mins later to say that it was actually cream based. D'oh. I put in another order snd away she went. She came back yet again to say good news! The chef can hold the cream if you like!  Sure thing! And it was great!   A nice, laid back place to eat, will be back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I waited 30 min at lunch to get pasta. When I complained, staff were completely indifferent. To make matters worse, you stand in line forever and then serve yourself the food, and yet you still tip like you're at a full service restaurant. And when I finally got my food (which I had to put in a to-go box because it took forever), it was over cooked and really mediocre. Never go here."}
{"text":"A cross between fast food and gourmet sit-down. The limbo is worth it! Quick prep times (we didn't wait longer than 10mins) and very filling! The menu is also super diverse - sure to suit everyone's cravings."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Ordered their often raved-about funghi pasta and what I got was a plate of overly thick pasta with a sauce that failed to incorporate the robust flavours of the mushrooms. When places do this dish right the richness of the cream is infused with the deep flavours of the mushrooms ... Tostos failed miserably in that department.  Their grilled calamari didn't fair any better unless you like rubbery calamari with a single note seasoning."}
{"text":"Awful service, had to wait at the front for awhile for a cashier to come. The cashier was rude and actually got our order wrong - I was not given a receipt and only realized once the food came that it was a different kind of pasta then I ordered. The service was very slow, we waited 35 minutes for Caesar salad and garlic bread and 1 hour for the (incorrect!) pasta. The Caesar salad was thrown together and drenched in too much dressing and the garlic bread was cold. I ordered the pomodora pasta but they gave the Norma one instead. At that point it had taken too long for the food to arrive so we didn't say anything. The pasta was drenched in sauce, which was too acidic. It is supposed to come with eggplant, olives, mushroom, tomato, basil, leek and garlic oil, but it had only olives, tomatoes and barely any eggplant. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up.  Wasn't super busy when we went on a Monday around noon. I love the vibe of the place - quite modern and inviting. I got the Soppressata pizza and it was very filling. The toppings complimented each other well and the crust was a perfect level of crunch. Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"Caprese was awful.  Came here for a quick lunch, I work down the street. I guess it was only $10 for a \"big plate\" but it was 95% oily arugula with some (5 in total) mealy slices of tomato, bocconcini and some kind of basil infused balsamic vinegar. Everything tasted kinda weird. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Ordered Bolognese 3.5/5 (could add more meat and flavour) Carbonara 2/5 (had to add salt,  sauce was dry and pasty so you could pick up the entire pasta dish with your fork) Calamari 1/5 (rubbery, hard, chewy. Only reason it gets one star is for the sauce with Argula, olives and cherry tomatoes( Caesar salad side 2.5/5 (barely there dressing with barely there flavour, croutons were good. Not worth $6, maybe $3-4."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat during my lunch break and I stumbled across two massive orange doors. As I walked in, I was welcomed by very friendly staff and a casual atmosphere. Their menu was simple: pizza, pasta, and sandwiches.   I didn't want to eat anything too filling, so I decided to try out their Saltimbocca Sandwich and an Americano. The flavors were well-balanced, meat was soft, and the bread wasn't crusty. As for the Americano...meh; but I'd definitely come back again to try out their pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"Allow me to begin by saying that as recently as 8 months ago, I frequented this place because I loved it.  I thought that, notwithstanding the wait, the food was worth it and the staff always remembered me.  I loved the pasta carbonara, arugula salad, prosciutto sandwiches, and frankly just about every pizza.  In the last few months, however, each time I've gone I've had a worse and worse experience. And now I've had it.  This place calls itself a \"quickfire\" but it is nothing of the sort at lunchtime.  I've repeatedly had to wait in excess of 30 minutes for my order to be filled.  No sit-down restaurant with those ticket times keeps my business; a fast-food joint should be no different.  In one recent example, they entirely forgot about my order.  When I presented them with my 40-minute-old receipt (!) I was welcomed with a blank stare and another 15 minutes before my order was filled.  So much for my lunch \"hour.\"  In the most recent example, I did what others have recommended - call ahead and pick up for more efficient service.  I arrived, paid, and was told that my order would be up in \"just a bit\".  Fair enough.    So I stand in their alcove and watch as my order comes up, not even five minutes later.  I watch as two of the staff look at it, bag it because they know it's a call-ahead order.  I see them look up.  I make eye contact with one, point at myself and ask \"carbonara?\". Blank stare, she turns away.  Five minutes pass.  They roll down the plastic bag and I can see my order is cooling.  I ask again.  I'm ignored.  Another several minutes and the young woman finally reads the full ticket and calls my name.  I am ignored as I explain that I've been waiting 15 minutes watching my order congeal, and that this is unacceptable.  I leave, peeved.    Arriving back at the lunch room I discover that my order is not only cold, but the sauce isn't a sauce, it's a runny, watery, yellow oily mess that tastes like nothing, much less a carbonara.  I am starving and scarf it anyway, hoping that the egg sauce is still safe to eat.  What a shame.  I used to love this place, but never again. Caveat emptor, folks."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my coworker. We couldn't decide whether we wanted pizza or pasta so we ended up getting both to share. We got the pesce pasta & umami pizza. I understand that it was busy, but the service was incredibly slow. We waited 20 minutes, maybe even more for our order while the people behind us got their order even before us. It's a self service place so you have to wait for your meal and then find a seat. I found that the staff weren't very friendly (but maybe it was just that day). But anyway, back to the food. The pizza was amazing. The dough was light and had the perfect crisp to it. Definitley up there as one of my favourite pizzas. The pasta however was a miss for us. We probably should have asked what some of the ingredients were, but the flavours just didn't go well together. This might have just been the pasta that we ordered so I would still come back to try the others. Also, it was a bit more on the pricey side for a fast-food pizza/pasta place. Overall: Pizza: 5/5. Pasta: 2/5. Service: 2/5."}
{"text":"Great casual, communal place to grab a quick, GOOD, pizza and get out. Kind of like Levetto actually.   In my opinion, Levetto and Tosto rate the same. Similar pricing, with different sizing for pizza. With Tosto, you have a larger, communal, and dimmer place for seating than Levetto. Tosto is great for gatherings of people 3 or more, up to even 10 while Levetto would be for a one on one sesh.   SALSICCIA - nice play on tastes and hits the right spot. I was craving those veggies, and felt guilty free doing so (even though I'm munching on pizza).   BRASATO - basically breakfast pizza. My friend got this and lemme tell you, it is blessed. Not just breakfast, for anytime of the day. It is totally filling (probably too much for me, unless you want a food coma) but honestly, super awesome. The egg on top is perfect. Get ready for that good coma right after this one.   Service: pretty good. It's more order at counter, they ring you up and you go get the pizza. Nice overall.   Ambiance: super laid back. Come in sweats, a batman suit, just not naked (plz). Dim lighting, great for groups or even dates.    Washrooms are a bit of a walk into another building, but hey you'll need it after this meal perhaps.   Overall, would come to again - great ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes from this place, their menu had lots of yummy sounding things and their space was beautiful.  The food, however, was disappointing.  I had a pizza to share with a friend, and a bolognese pasta dish.   The pizza was all bread, very dry and tasteless.  The pasta was a bit better, but the thick pasta all stuck together and was difficult to eat.  The prices are fine, but there is so much better Italian food out there ... it's not rocket science!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Grab a seat first as tables can run out during lunch rush. Order your food. Wait for buzzer to vibrate. Grab your food. Drinks. Utensils. Pretty much self serve. Fair prices. Funghi pizza was delishhhh and really filling. We also ordered both Romano and caprese salads. Very lightly dressed but refreshing. Would return for a quick bite next time I'm in the area and try the other pizzas."}
{"text":"I live close by and received their flyer in my mailbox. Now, most flyers I receive make a quick dive into the recycling box in the lobby of our building (because we need ANOTHER sushi rest. or another burger joint downtown...ppfftt!).....well, for some reason this restaurant's flyer didn't.  It made all the way up to my apartment where I actually read it, looked the restaurant up online and even.....gasp....yelped it for reviews. (I know, right?!)  A few days later, Wednesday afternoon to be exact, I thought I'd try it.  Why not....what else is there to do on a Wed, afternoon? Eat! (yay!)  Wheelchair Accessible door - check.  Spacious digs - check.  Menu on the wall - check.  Attentive staff - check! (see where I'm going with this?!!! ;) )  Clean - super check.  It was all so easy. Ordered, paid and sat down. (I'm sporting a cast & crutches....so, this next part was cool for me...) Gracie, who took my order brought me my drink at my table, then when my order was ready....courteously, delivered the meal to my table.  Now, here's where I was super impressed.....normally, they would take your name upon ordering, and you'd go up and pick it up from the front counter when it's ready.  Nope! Gracie saw that I wasn't able, and took it upon herself to bring it over to me. (little things like this do matter, btw!)  Huge helping of food (had the Funghi) tasted great (think - comfort food!) and I didn't feel rushed or overwhelmed by any loud music playing or people milling about. Great balance!  Now, I get that this is a Bay/College restaurant. Lived in the neighbourhood for a million years and never stepped foot in it's previous incarnation of restaurants. It's never been the area to get 'good food' (Select Sandwich?!! Really?!!)...but, dear reader.....things have now changed! It's good. It's really good, actually!  I've only ever written a few other reviews here on yelp....I'm by no means a foodie or a big reviewer....but, I liked this place.  I think it a really great place, with great food and great staff. (see, I used 'great' three times in that sentence!)  Go try it.  Really, what do you have to lose?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The menu consisted of a variety of pasta and stone baked pizza options. I got the funghi pasta and it was really good. However, it did take 15 to 20 minutes to cook. So if your in a rush would definitely recommend calling in ahead of time to place your order. Other than that would definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"I popped in today and ordered a pizza and pasta which were both pretty solid; it's a nice spot for group dinners or a no fuss date.   More important than the food was the service which was top notch. The woman behind the counter was so warm and welcoming. Will be dropping by again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to get quick pizza or pasta. The ambiance is good. It has a chill \"friends\" style coffee house vibe. They wide variety of flavors. They even cater for large orders.   First time I ordered food for 10 people at my work. We had the party size Margherita and Fungi Misti pizzas. Everyone loved the pizza base, cheese and the flavors.  I ordered fungi Pasta the second time and it was delicious.  Next time I got the Norma pasta. Needless to say, it was delicious too  I highly recommend to checkout this place for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"The hubby took me here for the first time tonight (Friday). I would describe this place as a very upscale fast food restaurant (with prices to match) with a great relaxed somewhat intimate atmosphere (because of the dim lighting). Arrived at 8pm and it was busy but didn't wait for the food too long. We ordered the Aragosta pasta, Brasato pizza, bottle of red wine and Pistachio Chocolate Mousse for dessert (desserts depend on availability). Chefs cook with love in this place! Food was really good, cooked to perfection and dessert was the perfect sweetness. Service is good and friendly and they keep the place clean! All great points and big bonuses - reasons why we'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. The set up is quite strange, similar to Nandos where the order is placed at the counter and you await then to call your name. I find this a little haphazard... One could invest in buzzers or assign table numbers.  Food: Just acceptable. I ordered the carbonara. Pasta was overcooked and a bit on the salty side, but still found it satisfying. The station for dropping off used cutlery and dishes was really unpleasant. Not a fan of going to the place with a whole bunch of dirty dishes and food just left there.   Don't think I'd return since there are plenty of better Italian options in the area."}
{"text":"If you're craving a cheap plate of pasta or a pizza, this could be the place for you! The new owners/management have let the quality slide. You also have to pick up your order from the counter and if you're kind enough, there's a busboy station for you to bring your dirty dishes to. Why they ask for a tip, I don't know. (I still tipped, but was scratching my head after doing it.) I like the mushroom dishes (pasta more than the pizza) and the Caesar salad is pretty decent.  Don't go expecting too much...and you're good."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite to eat with a friend. The staff are so amazingly accommodating and the food is to die for! It's home made Italian cooking at its best! If you want a little piece of nonna's kitchen I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place didn't really wow me unfortunately, which sucks because I had such high hopes for it! I ordered the brasato, which has béchamel sauce, mozzarella, pecorino, egg, mushroom, roasted cherry tomato, arugula and caramelized onion. From this list of ingredients I thought it was going to be amazing, but it was just meh. After tasting it I felt it had too many toppings that I couldn't taste anything distinguishable. The yolk was good and runny but didn't really add anything for flavour. Also, I expected with two types of cheeses and béchamel I would clearly taste cheese. Not even. I feel like this place has potential for good items but I think it's one of those places that one needs to try out everything before finding an amazing item. Would I go back? Maybe if someone else wanted to go. Would it be my first place to sit down and eat pizza? No sorry"}
{"text":"Great selection of pizzas! Fresh ingredients are combined to create flavorful options. I did find my pizza a touch salty, but that's likely from the cheese and olives...I'll still order it again.  The meatball sandwich is tasty too.  If you're eating in, they offer a small selection of beers, including Stella Artois and Peroni. The option to order ahead (pay with a credit card) using the Ritual app is super convenient if you're in a hurry or picking up lunch. Staff is efficient + super friendly and constantly smiling - adds a welcoming feeling!"}
{"text":"Boy has the quality ever gone downhill since its opening a year ago. It is now just an ordinary thickish crust pizza without much flavour. Entering through the heavy, unwelcoming doors, you find a cavernous place with not too many customers. This could be a thriving spot with a bit more attention to quality."}
{"text":"I came here for pasta and I was kinda disappointed. Prices are pretty high for the taste. Paid 16$ + tax for a plate of pasta that tasted alright. Nothing amazing or breathtaking. Was surprised when I found out you had to serve yourself- get the food yourself and even get yourself water. Why is it so expensive then?"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking to find reasonably priced places for Italian lunch on a Sunday in downtown Toronto. Most places were closed, or extremely overpriced, so we decided to try Tosto. I ordered the carbonara, which was $13. I was going to order funghi, but one of the employees said yolk based carbonara was her favourite and that I should try it so I decided to go with her recommendation instead. The pasta was rich, yet it was really delicious. I definitely tasted the yolk blended in with the noodles and bacon strips. The portion was huge and I wasn't able to finish my dish, partially because the dish was so rich in flavour.   I liked this place as you can just go up front to order, and you just wait in your table until the buzzer rings. Super convenient! I'd come back again when I'm craving for pasta, or when I want something filling for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love the pasta! I can taste the chewiness of the pasta and the freshness of the ingredients they use. Seems like a fast food but definitely a fine dining experience. Love the interior too!"}
{"text":"I eat here often enough that I should update my review. Actually, it's mainly that I should update it from 3 stars to 4 stars. Most everything I've had here, I've like. I finally tried their pizza a few weeks back and found that I really liked it. I also really like the Funghi pasta. It doesn't have any meat in it. For those times when I just don't want any meat, this is a delight. OK, I'm a little biased, anything with mushrooms in it, I tend to like, and the Funghi has lots of mushrooms in it. Actually, I would say most of the dishes here have lots of stuff in it. They don't skim on the ingredients or the portions.   I think the first time I was here, I felt like the carbonara could have been better. I haven't had that again, but I've had just about everything else. I don't know if the quality of the food has gotten better? Or if I was being particularly picky before. But I've found that everything tastes OK here. I've liked the food enough to continue to come back.   The service (which is mainly at the counter, because you will put away your tray and clear the table yourselves) is very friendly and nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good as a fast service sit down.  Food comes quickly and service is pleasant enough.   Overall the pizza is decent - crust is crispy and airy without being too doughy. The tomato sauce is fairly zippy and acidic. But it is missing a slight kick, but overall no serious complaints.  Pasta was ok. I thought the Alfredo a bit bland, but overall decent.  The service was pleasant for a quick service restaurant and the seating was fairly comfortable and had a decently plush ambiance for such a place.   Overall, it is worth checking out, if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and a catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I was on my way to another eatery but it was closed. Tosto was close by so I decided, \"Why not?\"  The atmosphere is very lively so I knew this was a trendy spot. Simple black and white menu and nice variety of options.  The norma was great although a bit bland (I had to doctor it up with some seasonings).    Otherwise it was a tasty, hot meal on a cold, frigid day in some wonderful company.  Good on you Tosto!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Friendly Staff. Lots of seating.  Good for groups.  Clean. Garlic Bread = very yummy. They serve Beer/Wine.  THE BAD: The pizzas weren't very good (had the prosciutto and my friend had the Affumicata).  The pizzas weren't hot enough, not enough cheese, and a bit too small/price. No build-your-own option. The ventilation fan is really loud, distracting from dining experience.  THOUGHTS: For a place that specializes in pizza, the pizzas need work.  They are priced lower than Pi Co, but don't taste as good.    IMO: Blaze is still the best in this arena (quickfire za)."}
{"text":"I dropped in the second day since it's opened. It's the newest addition to the Metro-Beer Store complex; I was pleasantly surprised to see this addition. Conveniently located in a complex, there's heaps of parking and a perfect place to pick up lunch pre or post grocery shopping. I did the latter on a Sunday afternoon. They specialize in pizza (Roman style) and pasta; the menu also has salads and various Italian appetizers as well. It's a cafeteria style - you order your food and then wait for your buzzer to buzz before you walk up to the counter to collect your order. Price wise, it's not too expensive. You can get a personal size pizza for under $10 and it was quite hearty. As it was only their second day since opening, the service was a little slow. My buzzer buzzed so I went to the counter to pick up my small pizza and instead, was given a 'dine-in' pasta. Anyway, I will drop in a second time to see if the service has improved.  Good for: pizza, take-out, Italian"}
{"text":"Frequented this place for over a year now, have tried some different stuff on the menu, thought I'd give an overview of what I've had.  Pasta: Pasta made in the house, it's thick and doughy. I don't think everyone will like it but it's pretty good to me. Aragosta ($17) - Their lobster pasta that I get every time. Amazing flavour profile, good amount and size of lobster meat. Carbonara, Polpette (meatball) - Some of the other pasta that I've tried from my initial visits. They're okay.  Salad (main: $9-10, side: $6-7): Caesar - Decent; has arugula. Caprese - Nice, refreshing salad. I like the balsamic vinaigrette.  Mandarin Almond - Recent addition. Pretty good.  Pizza: Brasato (single size $9) - Only pizza I've had. It's the one with eggs. Really good if you feel like eating a pizza.  Sandwich: Salsiccia ($10) - Only sandwich I've had. The sausage one. Also pretty good but the bread is a bit too hard.  Sides: Funghi Crostini ($8) - Not good. Doesn't taste like what it looks like. It's strangely sweet. Calamari ($10) - Pan fried calamari. Good but share this with someone else; flavour gets boring if you try to eat the whole thing yourself.  So the overall menu really doesn't warrant a 5/5, but the Aragosta is so good that I can care less about the other pasta options. Staff is nice and dining environment makes me feel comfortable. I just like the overall vibe of the place, it wins my stomach and heart. 5/5"}
{"text":"Ordered uber eats - the pasta was really good (Funghi and the Norma).  You can tell it's fresh / home-made.  Pizza left something to be desired (Margherita),  I really didn't like the dough.  It was kind of pillsbury-like and there wasn't enough cheese.  The garlic bread was alright.  Overall no complaints."}
{"text":"Enjoyed yet another dinner at Tosto Quick Fire catching up with friends. The food is undeniably fresh, tasty, generous, and affordable (including premium beers like Sapporo for $5!).  Tonight I had the Calabrese Pizza (which I can't seem to stop ordering), a new lobster pasta they were trying out which had big pieces of l lobster claws and the ever so delicious Calamari which sauce should be bottled and sold!  I keep going down my list of friends wanting to share the experience with them.  Definitely an experience one should try out and have on their own!  #OneHappyCustomer #DoNotTakeMyWordForIt #GotToTryIt #BestKeptSecret #NewKidOnTheBlock"}
{"text":"I fully expected to leave a little dissatisfied. I'm quite picky with Italian food, especially since my mama provides the real deal for free ;) But Tosto was a very pleasant surprise.  We had a big group that they accommodated quite well, especially considering that this is a self-serve style restaurant.   We got a big variety of orders from the pizza and pasta menus.  I ordered the funghi pasta. Pasta was delicious and (I believe) homemade, which is really impressive for a self-serve restaurant. Sauce was rich without being too heavy, and the truffle taste was just right (not too strong, not too subtle).   We also ordered the caprese salad, norma, calabrese pizza, bolognese, and nero. All delicious, minus the nero. The \"squid ink\" noodles were... Not squid ink. I think it's an unnecesary addition to the menu if they aren't going to do it right. However, the success of the other dishes definitely made up for this one dud.  Prices were very fair, and portions were HUGE! That's always a seller for me personally.  I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good here. It does remind me of Levetto a bit but with a bigger menu. The quality is not as good as Levetto though. We had the mushroom pizza and pasta bolognese. The pizza was not bad. It had a nice crispy crust but I wasn't that blown away by the pasta. Overall it was a decent place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it takes 20 mins to get water. Water that I had to bring to the table myself. 1 glass of water.  The server/cashier refused to give me the glass bottle for some reason.   I understand this is a no service restaurant but that doesn't mean it should be negative service??? The cashier made this the worst dining experience."}
{"text":"Awe man I hate to do this, but it's a no from me. I went with a friend. We had two single pizzas and one side salad. The cost was $30. The food is awful. I'm sorry it really is. And way over priced. The atmosphere is really nice though. But ya, it's a no go."}
{"text":"We were in downtown walking when my daughter said she wanted to take us for a coffee and dessert. I was so surprised when she went towards the door, I thought its was a construction site, she started laughing, she opened the orange steel door, and inside was a nice restaurant. They have a variety of pizzas, pasta, salads. We ordered cannoli, it was fresh and good bite size.   To use the bathroom you have to go to through the steel door. its weird because it doesn't say on the door. Something new.   Will come again to try the pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"A very weird mixture of classy with self service.    Food: (5 stars) Very large delicious portions. I got fungi pasta and was very pleased with the result.    Service: (3 stars) You order food at the counter at which point you pay, and you are given an option for a tip (or a bribary as I see it since you do not know how the service/food will be). You are given a pager and asked to seat yourself. When the pager buzzes you go pick up your food from the counter.   When you are done you are requested to clean up the dishes after yourself.    Atmosphere: (4 stars) Very open concept, super high ceilings.    Overall: The fact that they are charging over 15$ for pasta and asking you to be your own waiter and busboy really bothers me.  Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Excellent pastas for a semi takeout place. Great atmosphere and decor. Tried The funghi and bolognese pastas - fresh pastas were cooked well. The daily specials and happy hour are a great deal. Didn't try the pizza though."}
{"text":"-Nero Pasta (Squid Ink Linguine, Tiger prawn, poached cherry tomato, white wine, olive oil, garlic, chili flake, basil, salmon caviar) - $16 While the presentation of this dish looked amazing with all the different colors contrasting with the black linguine noodle, sadly the taste felt short. The pasta was undercooked and I could still taste the raw wine and garlic as well, and what's with the overused of olive oil? I kid you not, there was a puddle of olive oil underneath all that pasta. I even questioned the staff if the nero pasta was supposed to be that oily, they told me that's how Italian pasta is supposed to be... WHAT?!?!?! Anyhow, though the staff was nice enough to offer me a different dish, I decided not to order anything else and just eat the pizza instead.  -Patata pizza (potato, sausage, mozzarella, sun dried tomato, rosemary, bechamel sauce) - $8 To be honest I dislike white sauce pizza and unfortunately this pie wasn't able to change my mind. Since the patata pizza had the bechamel sauce as the base sauce, it was incredibly rich and fatty, thus it really needed something acidic to balance out the flavors. With that said, for $8 the portion was generous and more than enough for a single serving! With every bites you are getting some crunches from the potato, the dough was thin and remained soft without becoming soggy from the sauce."}
{"text":"A crunchy pizza for your taste buds  Tried the Mushroom and Truffle and Chicken pizza. Could taste individual toppings and was not overpowers by cheese.  I am certain they can make a loaded pizza if we asked."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch/early supper today at Tosto Quickfire Pizza Pasta.  I love love love pizza and I ordered a \"shareable\" Soppressata pizza (the middle size).  I was hungry and found it was just the right size for one person.  It was a good pizza.  I didn't find it spicy at all, though.  The crust was nice and crispy.  Penny was my server and she was very friendly and chatty."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service needs work. Been here before when it was self service and it was slow back then. Now with full service, still slow. Food was faster but they are understaffed with only 1 server for the whole restaurant. Need to have better service."}
{"text":"This place has great, fresh toppings, a great, light fried crust from being cooked deep-dish style (the pizza crust itself is not deep dish, though). In many ways it's probably lighter than your other pizza types, and square, not round.   It's delicious!  The *only* issue is the lack of a \"create your own\" option. I'm sure they say they do this for expediency, but in reality lots of pizza places will fire your pizza to order quickly, so it's not really a great argument. Change that, and this is a five star pizza shop!"}
{"text":"After recommending this place to me, a friend took me out to lunch here. We ordered at the front and then waited for our pager to go off while we sat down. The carbonara and the wild mushroom pizza were delicious! Definitely want to try other items on the menu when I return."}
{"text":"Great place!!! We have been going there since it opened and we still like it a whole lot! Pastas are amazing. Great set up, very quick and efficient service, you get your food usually within 10-15 minutes at most. It's also quiet and never crowded. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I was sceptical of this place after reading he lukewarm Yelp reviews but my experience was great!  The counter service was easy and the staff is courteous. They give you a buzzer that lets you know when your order is ready. Like all counter-service you take your own utensils and condiments.   We got the Brasato pizza ('share' size for $15). The share size is good for two people - 3 square slices each with a generous amount of toppings. The crust is light and flaky - like an in-between of pizza dough and phyllo. Sunny side egg perfectly cooked and runny. Everything well seasoned.   I think it's well worth the price. I found that I was paying Boston Pizza-like prices but for a better quality pizza. Can't wait to come back and try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick takeout service, flavorful pasta with too little sauce.   We ordered two pastas, the Chicken Pesto and Norma. They were ready to go within 10 minutes. Both were delicious, but somewhat dry.  Would have liked a \"build your own pasta\" option."}
{"text":"I LOVE Tosto. This particular location is wonderful for its service, but I still feel the pasta at the Vaughan location is much tastier. Love the price, portions and we always leave happy and full!   We always order the same pasta (Funghi). It's simply delish and to die for. Super flavourful and rich. Just love it!   We always come back when we're in the area or have some serious pasta craving."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and they were super busy. We waited pretty much an hour for our food to come. The manager was apologetic and dealt with it well. However, the staff was a different story.   I tired the online ordering system once (you can pick the time for pick up) but they didn't receive the order and I had to wait 10 minutes. Even though the customer service has left much to be desired, I absolutely LOVE the pasta (Funghi). The sauce is so rich and I'm stuffed every time. I would LOVE to eat this pasta everyday. I found the pasta was better at the Vaughan location vs. Eglinton. If I had to have my last meal on earth... the Funghi pasta is definitely one of those dishes!   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 4/5 Great prices and great tasting pasta. Wasn't so much a fan of their pizzas. I've visited a few times now, slowly trying their whole pasta menu.  Food: 3.5/5 First time I tried Tosto, I tried their pizza and pasta. The pizza was mediocre, not thin crust but also not too thick. They are a little heavy on the cheese, and light on the sauce.  However I've tried numerous of their pastas and enjoyed them all. Their Aragosta and Manzo were especially good.  Service: 4/5 Service is good and friendly, I was greeted by one of the cooks in the back. There aren't many people in the kitchen, so the wait for food might get long depending on how busy the restaurant is.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Casual ambiance and overall clean restaurant. The restaurant definitely has a \"chill\" and \"hipster\" vibe to it, with it modern-industrial look. It is open concept, including the kitchen, so you can see the cooks making your food. There is seating for about 35 people, some regular table seating, and some raised table seating.  Tips & Recommendations: -Go for the pasta over the pizza -Try the Aragosta and Manzo pastas -Plenty of parking -Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Tosto Quickfire is a chain and I'm rating it with this in mind. We've eaten many of the items and been there to eat,  or ordered for pick up many times. First we have always found the service great.  However, I rarely eat the pizza,  as we choose the appetizers, salads and pastas. The Calamari has always been good as well as all of the salads. My favorite pasta is the the losbster followed by the spicy tuna. My husband like the Bolognese and the Carbonara. They are quick and the price is reasonable.  If you have any problems and let them know they will immediately fix it."}
{"text":"Really good and affordable pasta.  There is no servers, you order at the till, get a buzzer and sit down.  When your food is ready your buzzer will ring.  Their pasta is fresh and even better is if there are 2 pasta dishes that are $10 after 5pm.  Prices are very very affordable and the quality of food is very similar to other popular Italian restaurants in the city.  They are known for their pizza and pasta but they also have some appetizers and salad dishes."}
{"text":"Food was great. Pizza was really good. Funghi costini was da Bomb. Too bad they don't have prosciutto and carbonara was not creamy enough."}
{"text":"Dropped in here spontaneously last night to try their pizzas, and we were not disappointed. The parking is free, the menu had a wide range of both meat and vegetarian options, the food was delicious, and it's made right in front of you using fresh herbs/ingredients. We had the fungi pizza, the margherita pizza, and the caprese salad. The salad was ready in five minutes, the pizzas took maybe 15 minutes. We asked the guy behind the counter a few questions and he was both friendly and helpful. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Update:  I was booking a party at Scaddabush (Yonge & Gerrard) and told the manager about what happened with Tosto and he thought I was kidding,\"how can a business disregard their customers like that?\" So I made two reservations with Scaddabush to celebrate a promotion and new job, and the manager made sure to be present and took care of my guests and I. The staff went far and beyond to give us an excellent experience. So now, for every promotion, birthday, new job, etc.. my colleagues will come to Scaddabush -- though Tosto is closer."}
{"text":"Great, Simple, Tasty, Authentic!!  Great Flavors Simple Ambience Tasty food Authentic menu  Can't go wrong with this!  Update: removing a star as this time around the prior tables next to us were not cleaned and no one just cared about the same!"}
{"text":"We had a really great experience at this new restaurant. Opened about 6 months ago, Tosto offers an upscale Italian menu at mid-low range prices. The restaurant is located right off of Rutherford in a fast food plaza. It's a bit of an awkward location but it's visible from the road and has lots of parking. Offerings include pastas, pizzas, antipasti and salads, all around under $20. It almost has a Panera bread concept where you order at the front. They give you a buzzer to alert you that your food is ready and you go to pick it up.   We tried the Margherita pizza, the fungi misti pizza and the Manzo pasta. Similar in menu and flavour a to a nearby favourite, Levetto, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.   The pizzas were delicious. This is a nice thick bready crust that's crunchy at the bottom but fluffy throughout. The toppings tasted fresh and were generously distributed. The pasta was really delicious as well, the pasta was cooked well, had a generous helping of meat in the sauce and you could taste the cheese and green peas throughout.   Even though we took our food to go, the service was excellent, the lady at the front taking our order was exceptionally pleasant, she let us take our time with the menu, encouraged us to have a seat and gave us water while we waited. We felt very welcome to this restaurant as soon as we walked in because of her.   The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It's warm and cozy but spacious. The fixtures and interior in general are really cool and modern. There are a couple of nice couches to hang out on while you wait for your food which is a nice touch.   I've already began studying the menu for our next visit. I'm really excited about another great Italian place in the area and can't wait to go back and try some other items. I hope they keep up the good work and have lots of success!"}
{"text":"Being so close to home, the Y, and Women's College Hospital, we had high hopes for Tosto, and so we tried a take out order of pastas and a pizza.  I usually can't stand the use of the word \"meh\", but that was our reaction.  Except for the meatballs, they had an herb that both hubby and I didn't like so the dogs were happy that night.  The carbonara was okay, but nothing exciting.    The best item was the Funghi (Mushroom) Pizza, but it wasn't great enough to inspire a return visit.  It did inspire me to make my own linguini in mushroom cream sauce, and that was delicious, so, I guess I owe them thanks for that."}
{"text":"Solid pastas. Although the tomato based pastas tasted a bit canned (but fresh) and lack the deep richness of flavour that comes with simmering the crap out of it. But for 15 bucks ? This is how pasta should be priced unlike the some overly hyped pretentious establishments cough**buca cough** anyways I had the Nero which is squid ink pasta.. Very good flavour and seafood which also included ikura salmon fish row garnish which was a nice touch ... Only thing is service is cafeteria style where u get everything yourselves. They call you to the counter with a beeper thingy when the food is done, which is a bit weird I've only seen this system in Asia btw."}
{"text":"Known for scratch-made pasta and handcrafted pizza with reasonable price. It is a self-serve and causal dining place. This location is very spacious with high ceiling and there are many big tables for groups yet the ambiance is elegant.   We placed the order the counter and will receive a buzzer. When the food is ready, the buzzer will notify you to pick up the food from the counter.   3 of us shared one share size pizza and two pasta dishes.   Brasato pizza - braised beef with sunny side up eggs! Very delicious and flavourful. The pizza crust is very fresh and crispy.   Nero - squid-ink linguine with Shrimp and salmon caviar, roasted cherry tomato, chili flake. This is my favourite dish. It is a little spicy but very flavourful. It is not very saucy, but I think it is good and linguine is very al dente.   fungi - pappardelle with bechamel sauce, portabello, button mushroom, white truffle oil. The dish is pretty greasy, may because of the truffle oil, but I don't taste a lot of the mushroom taste. But it's only $14 and I should not compare it to a high end restaurant pasta?  The pasta dishes portion is very substantial. It's definitely good for sharing."}
{"text":"We came here on a saturday night around 7pm.  This place has its own parking lot, lots of parking space.  Tosto is a self serve place, grab a menu and a table, order at the cashier and will be given a buzzer for food pick up.  Place all dishes in the dirty counter once finish.  We had to wait around half an hour for our food that night, cuz they had two huge parties just went in.  Ordered  - grilled calamari ($10) to start, it was grilled to perfection!  - Puttanesca ($15), squid ink linguine, this was alittle bit too salty for our taste.  Probably because the pasta has anchovy & black olives, these two items made it extra salty - Salsiccia Pizza ($15) : share portion.  The crust is not super thin, but its extra crispy and have the perfect chewy texture In general, I would definitely return to try out other items on their menu.  Its a decent place to grab good not too pricy italian food.  would recommend reserving a table in advance for bigger groups!"}
{"text":"Takes too long. Everything is great, food is delicious and decent value, but they are slow slow slow. Make sure you are not in a rush! Even ordering takes too long - there is a fair bit of streamlining that needs to be done. You pick up the food when the pager rings, and you pour your own water, and you clean up your own table (they expect you to sort your dirty dishes too, onto specific shelves for each item) which is fine, but then why does the credit card reader ask for a tip? Get rid of that..."}
{"text":"Wow where did this place come from!   Disclaimer: I didn't have high expectations since I ordered through UberEATS. We needed something new to eat that wasn't chicken.  We decided to finally pull the trigger on Tosto. Spoiler alert.  We loved it!  We decided to pick a pasta and a pizza to play it safe.    We chose the norma pasta mainly because we liked to say gigli pasta. We added chicken to give it some substance.  The pasta was delivered in a little nice box and it was on the warmer/slightly hot side. Sweet!  We'll balance pasta. Not overly sauced. Very tasty. Yuu -uummmm  The pizza may have been the star of the show. We got the mushroom/funghi pizza. D to the lish. I didn't think they included truffle oil on the pizza, it's possible that there wasn't any on it all but lol boy was it great! Not your average pizza. No red sauce but it was sooooo good.    Needless to say wet going to be return customers and probably going to get the same dishes again.    This place was definitely"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Never pick up their phone for takeout. Also, when customer is unhappy with their order, they dont do anything about it."}
{"text":"Tosto has fast, fresh and super tasty pasta and pizza. The food is very delicious, especially for the price. They make it right in front of you so it's fresh. Ingredients are quality and the portions are huge for the pasta. The pizza is a nice size for lunch.  My favourite items are the funghi pasta (super filling) and the brasato pizza (braised beef, cherry tomatos and a poached egg). The fungi pizza and pomodoro pasta are great as well.  Tosto is one of those restaurants where you order the food first, grab a table and then are called to pick it up when its ready. Service is fast, and the staff are friendly.   Overall, great place for a workday lunch. Good value too."}
{"text":"SUPER long wait times for lunch mon-fri.  I waited for 40 mins for my pizza today (without any warning). Gave them 2 stars because the pizza is actually good!  Go here if you're not in any kind of rush."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Toronto! I love this place, it's suitable for any occasion including business meetings. Pizza was fantastic and very delicious! Service was prompt and attentive. Definitely will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Best creamy funghi pasta so farrrr  8 dollars pizza deal with a free pop. Its always hard to find good creamy pasta but tosto make it tasty but not too creamy and their noodle is perfectly done"}
{"text":"Ordered the single-size funghi pizza and was pleasantly surprised. The funghi pizza (mushrooms, sundried tomato, rosemary, white truffle oil, pecorino cheese) was light and fluffy and the cheese and mushrooms just worked so well together. Plus I love me some truffle oil. The portion size may be a bit small for others but it was good for me, so I was pretty full from just the four slices.   My boyfriend's funghi pasta was pretty mediocre though. The flavours were bland and the truffle oil didn't shine through."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Tosto and my first 5-star rating here on Yelp.  Good: 1. Chic - container style door is an instant fun standard that Tosto sets, you'll get what I mean when you get to the front door Inside, the two level seating/ordering setting is entertaining. There's a kind of buzz in the air during lunch and at night, it can be buzzing too or a nice romantic silence. I'm not sure how to explain it but the relaxing paintings on the wall and the wood decor all around just adds to the experience.  2. Price - it's an order up front with a buzzer to pick up food style restaurant so there are no waiters/waitresses; this means no gratuity/tip required! You're paying a fair price for fun and interesting styles of pizza and pasta.  3. Entertaining - they've recently started serving brunch on weekends which to me says the owners is trying to stay innovative. I saw the owner the last time I went and he seemed to be a friendly and fun guy.  4. Spacious - for downtown Toronto, the high ceilings and availability of different types of seating really sold me. If you like high chairs/bar style seating, they have that. If you like your feet on the ground, they also have that. Pick and choose where you'd like to sit and feel free to move around to different tables if you see one you like open up.  Bad: 1. Customers clean up after themselves so that means selfish ones can leave behind a mess. 2. That's it!  Have fun at this chill and modern restaurant! Make sure to share food with your party there."}
{"text":"If looking for good quality of pasta and pizza for quick bite, this is the place... Great service, fresh food, like the ambiance... Must try pasta. I am vegetarian and I got lot of options to eat.."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has negative reviews.   Every time I come here the service is friendly, the food is amazing (best pizza I've had in Toronto), the ingredients are fresh and the prices are fair.  If you're not coming here for lunch or dinner, you're missing out. I've even come with a large group (at least 10) for a work lunch and we had zero issues with accuracy, speed, or service.  It's a beautiful, open kitchen and dining room, and a refreshing departure from all the tiny restaurants and greasy spoons in the area.  Try the Margherita pizza, my persona favourite!"}
{"text":"Got the BOGOH (buy one get one half) coupon in the mail and used it towards the pasta carbonara and bolognese. Came to under $25 with tax and tip. Taste-wise, it didn't rock my socks and still think Levetto is still better. Without the coupon, I wouldn't come back since it would be cheaper to go to Levetto. In terms of the atmosphere, 4 stars for high ceilings and a modern look. Overall 3 stars for pasta."}
{"text":"First time trying Tosto today, and I believe it won't be my last. It's a cozy quiet little place, where you can sit, unwind and enjoy a great meal! This restaurant is a quick service rest., where you walk in, place your order at the register and find a seat, where a server will bring your food to the table. Portions are fair in size, more on the bigger size. And they have some good selections of pizzas, Salads and pasta..as well as about 4 appetizers.  Food tastes great, pizza baked perfectly! And balanced very well  The restaurant have a full bar, with beer tap, bottles, wine selections and liqueur  I went there on a Friday afternoon, I was the only table..in and out... After you're done with your meal, you'd take all your glasses, plates, etc...and return them back onto a \"return station\" Same with any cutlery, napkins, sauces, water, etc...you go and grab it yourself! It's a cool concept, kinda strange and needs sometime to get used to ..  However, my downside here is the price...for a concept like this, where i'm basically doing most of the \"service\" work..I paid $35 for a small (4 slice pizza) and 1 pasta dish! Seems a little deep... I will probably try the place again since I like the food, but price needs to be brought down a bit to be fair...especially to stay in this competitive business while there are many similar options within a 5km range"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here- the prices are reasonable, portions are huge, food is made quickly and the quality is good. Their pastas are really fresh and highly recommend ordering any of them (the one with braised beef is yums). Their pizzas are alright, not a huge fan. The restaurant is really clean and I think there's free wifi so you'll see a lot of students here with their laptops plugging away. However, there is one girl who works at the front gave me some attitude when I asked her for two plastic containers for my olive oil and chilli flakes- she kept insisting it would be better if I put it on my pasta rather than taking it to go and when I said no, she rolled her eyes at me. Rude."}
{"text":"It was quiet and dark on a Sunday at 7 pm when we drove into the parking lot of Tosto. The parking lot was deserted and the restaurant was empty. My dinner mate said maybe we should go somewhere else?! But I insisted to give Tosto a chance.  The dining area itself is quite spacious. Self Serve Counter Service: You order at the counter and you will be given a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready.   We ordered:  Salad Romano ($10) - Refreshing and have a good mixture of greens (argula, romaine, radiccho) Pizza Prosciutto ($11) - Roasted cherry and roasted garlic brightened up the tomato base! Love how crispy the pizza is! Pasta Nero ($17) - Squid-ink Linguine with shrimps and salmon roe! love the use of garlic, caper and basil leaf to give it a more interesting flavours  We really enjoyed what we ordered, everything was tasty and exceed our expectations. I also love the more untraditional approach of the menu, so I will definitely be back again.  Price wise though it seems to be a little pricey for a restaurant that does not have table service. But the quality of the food certainly worth the price."}
{"text":"I saw another post that mentioned that great service. I would also say the service is very good in terms of the people, but not necessarily the overall service the restaurant provides given they charge restaurant prices. You order, you pick up your own food and you put your own stuff away, yet prices are equal to other restaurants in the area (Scaddabush for example).   That aside, most of their dishes are OK. I have found that some of their salads, such as the Caesar, have way too much dressing, while some of their pasta dishes, such as the Bolognese seem to be over spiced with too much sauce, not enough noodle (strange it is usually the opposite).   I still come here every once in a while as some of my co-workers like it. Some of the pizza's are pretty good. Someone mentioned the Margherita. At the end of the day there isn't much in the area so they are filling a void for those looking for a lunch time place. Get here before noon at lunch or you won't find a seat."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza place that has a very downtown Toronto vibe but for those of us who live in the GTA. The restaurant is laid out very nicely with a lot of space and a warm decor. The service was also quick (you place your order at the register, get a buzzer, find a seat, and the buzzer will buzz once your food is ready). In our case, because they weren't that many people there they brought our food to us :D.  Their menu was diverse and had many different dishes in case you aren't really craving pizza but I mean...Pizza is life so I doubt that will happen ;)  We ordered the Calamari and Caesar salad to start and they were both so good. The calamari was enough for the five us to share and it also tasted great (it had olives in it, which I found to be a great addition to the entire dish). The Caesar salad had a lot of other ingredients in it not just your basics and it was also a big enough for sharing.   For our main dish we ordered the Mushroom and truffle pizza which has me drooling even now when I look back at the pictures. The crust was soft and the mushrooms texture was on point. We also got the braised beef rigatoni which was extremely fresh. And the braised beef was...well..braised very well LOL. To be extra classy we ordered a lobster pasta dish but it was a little too spicy for me.   We decided to order some desserts after our meal and I loved the extensive tea options they had. I ordered one of their mint teas so I can get a little help digesting everything that I just ate, and we also got some mouthwatering cannolis SO GOOD I HAD LIKE 3.   ANYWAYS...Amazing experience and I would definitely go back with whoever is willing to see me inhale food."}
{"text":"We went there for their restaurant launch today around lunch time. Food was complimentary which was nice. Their fresh juice was definitely refreshing!!   The menu is printed on the wall for everyone to see and admire. Beside it, there's a wooden wall telling you their philosophy behind their cooking techniques.   The atmosphere was chilled with techno music in the background. The tables and chairs are comfy and classy. Washrooms are unisex and clean. I like how you get your own sink.   The food came out at a decent pace and it still came out even when I was stuffed - like Garfield!!   The Caesar salad was light and had a nice touch of arugula which was divine to see. Arugula is good for our bodies!!   These are the pasta dishes that they served to try it out.  I've only included the main ingredients. 1. Manzo: rigatoni pasta with braised beef ragu. 2. Pollo: pesto sauce, chicken and sautéed spinach. 3. Rose sauce with veggies. The first bite was \"oh my it's amazing-I want more\" as the noodles are cooked to perfection. It's chewy and flavourful with the sauce. No talking but just enjoying each bite. My favourite has to be the one with the pesto sauce. Love it!!   Pizza dishes included: Funghi misti, Calabrese with large pepperoni slices, and Prosciutto. The dough was interesting and it had the right amount of toppings.   Verdict: I would definitely go back for the pasta, especially the squid ink pasta as I saw it on Masterchef and have never tried it. They had it there for display but not sure if we were allowed to try it. A nice surprise lunch in Oakville! Interested to see what type of desserts they would have."}
{"text":"They recently increased the price:(((( but pasta tastes as good as before. Nero is delicious but Norma is still my favourite"}
{"text":"Really good value and food quality at this restaurant! Different options differentiate it from other Italian places. Great mixture of flavors in every dish. The pizza dough is delicious and perfect for sharing. A lot of options for anyone, great for larger groups and you eat very \"family style\". One of the best quick Italian places in York region, on par with levetto for sure! Great job!"}
{"text":"nice unique concept.  Simple menu, Pizza is not bad but wow was everything way too salty.    the crostini was covered with some sort of oil herb seasoning that was SOO SALTY i was not able to finish it.   i dont mean normal salty.. i mean unbearable and inedible salty, almost like the salt shaker cap fell off and it was covered with a mountain of salt which they tried to brush off...   the prosciutto on the pizza was also very salty.  That one was expected, but i had to pull some of it off because it was just too much.    I would give them a shot again only because i like the ambiance and i may have experienced a bad batch.   I will have to go back to confirm if that is true.  but for now.. if you have heart problems or osteoporosis... this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and pasta! It's a great atmosphere, very cute looking inside, but looks unattractive on the outside (don't judge a book by its cover).   It's a fast food place (Self serve). You walk in, order from the menu and wait for your food. They have a modern vibe going on inside. Nice tables and chairs and even cute couches to sit on for that hipster vibe. Great for cool Instagram pics.   Service was fast. We went in the afternoon, it's was pretty dead inside. Not that many people dining in. We ordered the prosciutto pizza (group size). It was pretty large about 12 square slices ($32). Very fluffy dough not thin crust at all which I like. It had mozzarella, prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, and black olives. Delicious! My friend ordered the nero pasta, which had squid ink linguine, shrimp, capers, and salmon caviar ($17) Amazing by the way.   Overall, I would definitely go back and try something different. I recommend this to anyone who loves pizza and pasta.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"We came on Good Friday and the place was busy. The pasta is made fresh and everything was delicious. Nomnom. Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"My review is for their coffee. I ordered a regular americano (which was only $2) and received a SUPER strong coffee. This is way stronger and flavorful than your regular Starbucks americano."}
{"text":"I cant believe how bad my experience here was. Went for lunch with a coworker and we arrived right after a huge table of 10-15 people got seated. That's where it all went downhill. 30 minutes into waiting for our food, we looked over to the huge table and realized that hardly anyone there even got their food. They were severely understaffed and couldn't keep up with the orders. We went up to the counter multiple times to ask when our food was going to be ready and since it's an open kitchen we could see the 2 cooks scrambling to get orders out but multiple customers kept coming up to complain about wrong/missing orders. Why is your restaurant so big if you can't even cook for people at a third of it's capacity?  At one point i saw them drop a whole basket of pasta on the floor but they just kicked it to the side as if nothing happened. It was like watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.   We ordered a pizza for $17 and a pasta for $15 but we ended up waiting almost an hour to get any food after constantly asking them where our food was. We ended up only getting our pizza and it was terrible. Crust was burnt and the sauce was like watery canned tomato sauce. Not to mention the prosciutto was extremely salty. We ended up getting our billed settled for the pizza and cancelling the pasta cuz we didn't want to wait another hour for it. I felt bad for that huge table of 15 people. Who knows how long they stayed..."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend on a Friday evening. I was coughing like crazy from getting over a cold and the girl at the front was so kind to make me a hot water with lemon and brought over honey for me. that is a pure 5 star customer service she was amazing.   We got spaghetti and meat balls and the funghi pizza. The spaghetti noodle is so good and flavourful on its own. The sauce was delicious and the meat balls were really good.   Pizza was really yummy. Crust amazing the dough amazing, baked just right with perfect flavours.   This place a great grab and go or sit and have a casual meal. I come back all the time."}
{"text":"Bad service, when we were paying I asked questions our first time there and she did not want to help us.a friend got a pizza and she said it was so bad. I got the Nero pasta wayyy overpriced for so little. For that price I rather go to an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been a  regular guest at  \"Tosto\" on Roehampton since the day it opened. The staff is very friendly , the food is always fresh, consistent, portions are great EXCEPT for the ONE dessert cannoli ( small, and I mean very small cannoli, 3 per order and a choice of vanilla, chocolate and lemon ) I realize they are meant to be small. However these are SO small that I am not sure if it's a joke or if I feel embarrassed  that anyone would serve these with a straight face. They are delicious and I would really love if they offered a real size cannoli to satisfy those of us who enjoy dessert.     In many ways I feel sorry I am writing this kind of review for Tosto because of the positive aspects of the place. I always call for take out and this is where the slippery slide down a very steep icy hill always seems to begin . I have lived in other countries and have travelled a lot, I have had to and can work with language barriers however in this case the struggle to place an order by phone or in person is as consistently painful as the positive consistency of their food. It has become a deterrent for me. Without going into great detail of the many painful attempts  I have made to order straight off their menu over the phone I will give a few instances.     I have endured everything from  ME; \" I would like the salumi\"  Tosto Employee : \" OKAY ! So ONE Polpetti Pasta? \" This dialog went back and forth for what felt like 5 minutes and I was put on hold at last 3 times. Each time I asked for Salumi  the Tosto employee responded with everything from Polpetti , polpetti pasta, crostini, pizza and on and on . Eventually I was understood then onto TRYING to order a salad to go through the SAME process again .    JUST today I went through the usual struggle over the phone to place a simple order for a Fungi pasta and a salad and again another way to long frustrating struggle .  It feels like a combination of language barrier and a total lack of product knowledge. I always wait longer then the time quoted for pick up and my order is never ready. If I ask for anything like extra cheese onside or to have my salad tossed in the dressing it causes so much confusion that it is NOT worth it to ask for what I want. Today when I went to pick up my order I asked if they have Brio. I really wish I. had not asked. I was offered sparkling water , flat water  and a couple of different kinds of soda. They do not have Brio. Placing an order with Tosto has become a joke between myself , my boyfriend and a couple of my friends because with out fail each time it is an unreasonable, time consuming struggle.     I am not new to any of this as I spent most of my working life up until a year ago in hospitality. I see this as very unfortunate because as I said they do great in so many other areas however to have such a communication breakdown at the Front of House that appears to be a combination of language barrier and perhaps even more so it is a  lack of product knowledge is truly a deterrent . I hope that they will work to improve this area."}
{"text":"Sooooo good here. Love the food and service. I always order when I'm at work and it's ready for pick up in 10-15 mins. The food is amazing!!! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Had the Margarita personal small size. Quite tasty, lacked salt. Did uber eats, so was a little cold at delivery. Not super ideal for the price but good enough."}
{"text":"The service here was really good. However, the food was pretty mediocre. We ordered the carbonara and the braised beef rigatoni pastas. There wasn't enough sauce in the carbonara and the pasta itself was really dry, which made the whole dish really dry. As for the braised beef rigatoni, the braised beef itself was really good. However, the rigatoni was harder than what I would prefer. It would also have been better if there was more sauce.  Overall, the environment seemed really nice. It's a food court style restaurant, so it's more casual. I may go back again to give it another chance and to try some other dishes, but I would definitely not recommend getting the carbonara or the braised beef rigatoni."}
{"text":"A great spot for quick lunch and dinner after work around the corner. Although the consistency maybe different sometimes, overall experience has been great!! Appreciated they made it freshly in house.  Love the carbonara pasta the fungli pasta and the carpres salad and pasta was great (not thin crust).  Staff has always been nice and always happy to modify for you."}
{"text":"The food was so yummy especially the squid ink pasta, it's 5 star food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is delicious.   The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5-star is that I don't like that you have to get your own cutlery, garnishes and picking up your food."}
