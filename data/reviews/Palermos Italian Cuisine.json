{"text":"This restaurant is a diamond in the rough! I think people pass it by because it used to be a Burger King, and they only advertise Italian food and cheap dinners. I ate here today only because the Mexican restaurant beside it was packed! I'm so glad I did. They have Greek and Mediterranean cuisine here also!!!!  The waitress was new and didn't offer much knowledge of the food or owners, but was very nice and attentive. For my appetizer, I tried the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), and they were delicious!! I had the Grecian ziti for my entree and OMG it was AMAZING!! This dish had multiple dimensions of flavor. I would highly recommend you give this little gem a try."}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you want take out spaghetti you can not beat their price and taste!  Also they have a drive through. Also the homemade ranch dressing is great!  Love their other choices as well."}
{"text":"Service was rocky to start but got better and the food was great! My picky three year old liked his pizza. My husband is Italian and even he liked the food. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could offer a review of the food at this place, but that`s impossible since we never even had our drink orders taken. I thought this restaurant looked clean and decent when we walked in, and the food smelled pretty good. We were seated promptly and given menus....and that`s when the good service came to a screeching halt. And I mean tires smoking, rubber burning halt. There were customers seated at  no more than 6 other tables in the entire restaurant and two waitresses that I observed. We sat there for 15 minutes and were never acknowledged by any employee in the place other than the one that had seated us. I found that pretty odd considering that one of the waitresses walked right by us four different times and waited on the people sitting at the booth directly behind us. She gave them their bill, walked by us, returned and asked if they needed anything else, walked by us, returned with to go boxes, walked by us, then brought to go cups and told the lady that her salad was bagged and waiting at the front for her, and walked by us again.Not once did she glance our way. At that point I had enough and decided that I would rather spend my money somewhere that I could actually get service in. It`s no small wonder that the parking lot is usually empty if this is the kind of service they serve up on a daily basis."}
