{"text":"I have been to Tequila Bar twice. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The fries were seasoned to perfection. There's a special twist to the flavours. You won't be disappointed. The only critique I have is concerning the portions. You may still have room in your stomach after finishing your meal.Therefore, I recommend you order an appetizer as well.  Price/quality ratio = good. Price/quantity= so-so.  This should not stop you from trying this gem. It's a must!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice so far. The first was a little disappointing (we ordered margaritas in late afternoon, it was ok) but the second time I had a better idea of what this bar is about since we were ordering from the varied tequila and mescal list. The selection and advice on the tequila options was really excellent. Snacks (jalapeño poppers, etc.) were also enjoyed by all, and the ambiance was great. So: if you go here, remember it's literally \"Tequila bar\" and go for the tequila."}
{"text":"Service was indifferent and mildly patronizing. I've never seen someone roll their eyes without actually rolling their eyes before. The flautas were easily the best part of the meal, but it's meat cheese beans and sour cream rolled up in a tortilla and deep friend, food court mexican food. I ordered the shrimp tacos, they were barely passable. The shrimp were obviously precooked and the toppings were just okay. So far, this would garner the restaurant a 3 star rating, but then came the tortilla chips that come with the meal, both my partner and I paid extra for cheese. Only half of mine was melted and the rest was in shreds (was this microwaved?) and I let the server know, he took it back to the kitchen and they put it back in the microwave to melt it the rest of the way. Also, strangely, the server told us it was a \"fusion\" restaurant. Indian and Mexican, and that could possibly work with the many spices and cooking techniques these cuisines have in common (bean, cumin, chilis, braised/slow cooked meats, etc etc). But there was absolutely nothing even slightly Indian in the food. So that was just odd to mention that. So if every other resto in St Henri is packed and you absolutely must get a beer in you STAT then sure come here. But if you are mostly looking for food, you have so many other wonderful options very close walking distance away."}
{"text":"Great dinner at the tequila bar. Great food and awesome margaritas!!! Will definitely have to come back! :)"}
{"text":"Well, not to be a spoiled sport but what....a disappointing visit we had.  My wife and I order a couple of margaritas from the bar and they were watered down Ok, let's try some bites. Ordered fish tacos and asked if they were breaded. The waiter said \"no we grill our fish\" so for 16.00 I ordered there 3 taco plate. The waiter said, oh you have a side with that. So I ordered a side of nachos with it.  We finished the watered down margaritas and waited for dinner. Finally dinner arrived. First, the tacos were small ( 4\") corn tortilla with lots of cabbage but...where's the fish? Each taco had less than a 1\" square of fish and they were tasteless. Disappointed to say the least. Second came the nachos. It came in a 12oz paper cup and to my surprise, just chips. No cheese, peppers nothing I asked the waiter what's up with this. His reply was, that's how we serve them.  Wow...after a lengthy conversion I said ok, please send some guacamole with it A few minutes later got a 2 inch condiment cup with unripe avocado smashed down.  Needless to say for a bill that was close to 70.00 we will never come back  Btw, went across the street to a little hole in the wall taco joint and finished our meal with an awesome chicken taco"}
{"text":"My friend is obssessed with Tequila so we went here for his birthday.  Kind of off the beaten path but very close to Cote Vertu metro so that's a plus.  We ordered the taco sliders to start.  They were pretty good, the bread was nice and soft.  For the main course I had chicken tacos and french fries.  They put this really nice cilantro spice on the french fries.  All of us were pretty impressed with the food.  The service was pretty good, and staff was friendly.  We were there until about midnight, and the place gets a bit... shall we say.... sketchy.  Apparently there was some pole dancing that we missed out on."}
{"text":"Just had tacos and nachos. The owner served us and he was nice. Very nice actually. I did not want the chorizo with my tacos and got the option of having beefstake only. For the nachos, we ordered the tandoori chicken on top of the nachos  The chicken was juicy, and the peppers were so good. It was actually almost too healthy. Thumbs up for the owner's service he is great."}
{"text":"Such a cute place.  Nice owner and service, owner is working his butt off!! Great food and strong drinks. Happy goers!! Will come again for sure"}
{"text":"15 of us went there after playing hockey on Tuesday night. The service was unbelievable. The food was excellent. Everyone ate at the same time and all within 30 minutes of arriving. Great place, great music. Excellent food and service. A definite repeat"}
{"text":"Tacos are average. Presented nicely but not all that tasty. More of a place to drink."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and snacks...food was bad, drinks were overpriced and weak, and service was very rude"}
{"text":"Great place! Wonderful & friendly service;  very tasty and spicy nachos (I think the best we've had!).  Loved my two mojitos and my husband loved his beer (Mexican beer).   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I've been a few times, and have been disappointed every time, but this one was the worst. I ordered a raspberry mojito that tasted like a ring pop. The $2 guac is barely 2 spoon fulls but comes with a huge bowl of chips so you have to order a second one. The shrimp tacos were spicy but flavourless, the fish tacos tasted like Indiana food, and the chicken quesadillas we're so awful that I took one bite and couldn't finish. I wish I liked it, but never again."}
{"text":"Nice place with good service and fresh food.  We ordered chicken and shrimp tacos.  We also ordered Quesadilla with spicy chicken. Each come with a choice of salad, fries or nachos so we ordered one of each. Food has smaller portion size but tastes better. Each one come with 4 dips and spicy one was pretty good. On a cold snowy evening, what you need is a good food and a good drink!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, am a big foodie/cook, and I'm  from California originally (so grew up with great Mexican food).   I was so happy with this place!   It's a cool little bar that serves great food with a simple menu with items that are well thought out.   We ordered the taco sliders (two of each small chicken, chorizo, and steak) with three great, fresh, flavorful sauces.   Delicious!  The jalapeño poppers were uniquely prepared split in half and baked (instead of  the usual  fried)  for an extra bright, fresh taste...yet topped with some panko so you still get the desired crunch.  Yum!   I liked, but did  not love, the salmon  tartare tacos as I expected more of a poke consistency and  flavor and it was more tuna-sandwich like, but still flavorful; I would just not order it again as the other two items were stellar and I'd like to experience more from this menu.   My margarita was fantastic as it  was not slimy from syrup or too sweet or tart....and a perfectly thought-out mix and included a  thin  slice of  candied orange slice as a pleasant, creative touch.    The vibe in the place is really cool and the owner (who happened to serve us on a slow/freezing/snowy-streets night...I understand that the place is typically jumping), Viral, was  kind, warm, sharp, and very welcoming; we enjoyed speaking with him.   He is a proud native Montrealer with an East Indian heritage.  I had to ask what made him open Le Tequila Bar and he explained that he was mind-blown by the East L.A. street  tacos he experienced in California and had  to bring this home to his city  (that although Montreal is known for a great  variety of quality ethnic food, was sadly lacking in Mexican food).   The food, ambiance, and hospitality of  the owner makes me look forward to  coming back and making this a regular hang out, and a great stop for taking friends/family who come to town.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went there during the Mexican independence day, so we asked for some Mexican music to celebrate, they actually told us no because they didn't want to disturb the clients and that they were actually a Californian bar in spite of the  obvious Mexican decoration and name. Plus the waiter was very rude."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of spicy tacos, but the meal (and the fries!) were the perfect amount. At 20$ for a meal (3 chicken tacos) and a beer, the price is pretty good. We went early so the place was not very busy, but the service was still excellent, and everyone seemed friendly.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Omg, their food is amazing. Tandori style chicken tacos were the best tacos I've ever had. Also, save room for some dessert. Gulab Jamuns dessert served over ice cream were fresh and delicious. I can't rave about this place enough. Plus the waiter Pinar was a total cutie!"}
{"text":"I will never go back here.  It takes soooo long for the bartender to make a drink.  I sat at the bar for 15 minutes (the place was empty) and I wasn't even asked if I wanted a drink. Watching the bartender struggle to make two drinks (for 15 minutes) was pathetic.  Only go here if you have all day to wait around and never get served."}
{"text":"This is a super fun place! Went there after our hopes of finding a new Mexican favorite (Amaranto on Monkland) were dashed (badly!!). We really wanted some margaritas to wash out the bad experience. In the end, no margaritas were to be had, but we made up for it with other cocktails.  First, the service is five star!! The owner is very friendly and attentive, comes over regularly to see if everything is ok and seems like an all-around really nice guy. The server we had, Genevieve, was a doll!! She was so sweet and let us take our time and was super informative.  We only sampled the chicken quesadilla, which was very tasty and just what we needed. The guacamole on top was great and the sauces they give on the side (garlic, then a very hot red sauce, a green sauce and a pico de gallo) were all fresh tasting and a great compliment to the quesadillas.  The drinks!!! Very strong, no messing around here with crappy watered down stuff! We stuck to their cocktails, and had several of the Latin Lover (very sweet and the cranberry was the strongest note I felt), Mango Mohito (wow, VERY strong, not for the faint of heart and less sweet, more minty) and Tequila Bar Sunrise (also hardcore strong!!).  The bar is fun, has two stripper polls (haha), some pool tables, some gaming machines in the back, looks clean, has cool lighting, and the music is really good.  All in all, the vibe is just right due to a good mix of tasty food, super duper staff, good music and good prices.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Liked the ambiance. Lively music, pool tables.. Feeling young and fun. Chicken wings were great with all three dips. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Fun neighbourhood bar/restaurant. Went in to have drink ( love Tequila ). Quebec has a pretty crappy selection of Tequila., so I hope they get some private stock. Had the nachos, big portion and great dipping choices. The booze prices are downtown, but the food prices were St-Henry. The staff was lots of fun."}
{"text":"Went there recently with friends for happy hour on a Friday. Was relatively empty except for the poker machines in the back. Also, the decor would need updating and a major marketing campaign would promote this location as this is in a great location."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place, not just for the long list of Tequila and the shorter menu of Mexican Quesadillas, Tacos, Poutine and Sandwiches, but for the cultural mix present and influencing the output from the Bar and Kitchen.   Not only is this place reminiscent of Hernando's Hideaway for taking you down the stairs into the basement of an Islamic Study Center, where you can hear the Call To Prayer coming through the ceiling; but also for the Indian ownership that creates a Tandori Chicken Sandwich that interplays the Tandor BBQ flavor into the Mexican soul of the cuisine.  Maybe it's just me, but I had never thought of an Indian-Mexican culinary alliance.  It has great possibilities. The Tacos come open face and ready for two salsas, guac, and a dollop of sour cream.  Roll your own, baby.   The place is warmly dark and inviting, with fluorescent colors in the rafters.  The Tequilas are a sight to behold lined up behind the bar on four or five shelves, and just waiting for you to grab a lime and salt shaker.  The Margarita was smooth, killer quick and struck like a viper.    This was definitely the place to come to hide from the heat, and sample the silky Tequilas and a big plate of Poutine Mexicana, an original variation of Montreal's most famous contribution to the world of French fries - think of it as Nachos with fries rather than chips with a lot more cheese and choice of chicken, beef, chorizo, or veggies.  Everything else we tried was fresh, tasty and original.  Awesome. Just awesome all around."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. I arrived with a group of friends just as the kitchen was closing so I just ordered the first thing on the menu (Quesadilla's, they were ok, I was really hungry so I practically inhaled them and didn't taste much though. The side of nachos was bad, did not eat those). Prices are ok 13-16$ a plate that comes with a side of fries/nachos/etc.  We were there mainly to drink, talk and dance and this is a pretty good place to do it.  They played some awesome music, there was enough place for dancing, the place wasn't too crowded (this way I didn't feel self conscious), and the service was good.   I would probably only go back with friends. I don't think it's a good place to have an intimate dinner with."}
{"text":"I plain give a 5 stars because there was nothing bad when I went there. Although, I have to say, I was also on a \"date\"...  The service is good, staff are friendly. It's quick enough ...I may was been also too much into the conversation (didn't see the time goes by haha).   I really like the artwork in the restaurant. It felt like a mix of Mexico in a big modern city? Else, the music is basically what you would hear in any bar.   I ordered the tacos which were good too.   I guess I was also more concentrated on my \"date\" than the restaurant itself hahaha :P"}
{"text":"Food was good, love the fries!! The Grand Marguarita was good and they definitely didn't cheap out on booze. The music was awesome, the service was great, and the place looks pretty chic despite the fact that the entrance looks slightly ghetto (been living in the area my whole life and always assumed that it was some sketchy bar). My only complaint would be that the prices were a bit too high for me. Nonetheless, I would totally suggest this place to anyone who wants some real good authentic Mexican food and is tired of Three Amigos."}
{"text":"Meilleur bar de St henri. Ambiance tranquille, service excellent. J'y vais tous les mardis. Meilleurs tacos de st Henri!"}
{"text":"Situated in Saint-Henri, this little hidden cozy restaurant is what Montreal is all about; digging out nice caché restaurants.   I had the al pastor quesadillas with their nachos. Let's start with their nachos, they are addictive to me I don't know why. It comes in different colours which might sound weird if it was your first try but their salsa and different sauces makes them fine and delicious to dip in. My quesadillas were quite delicious. Al pastor; which is shawarma style meat, in this case pork. The meat is well seasoned, combined with the cheese and corianders with a dash of guacamole makes the dish authentic.  They also have a variety of cocktails drinks to choose from to go with your meal (and of course tequilas).  The staffs are friendly and music is good.  Fun fact: Tacos Tuesday. Girls night Wednesday. They have other specials on other days too!  Bonus: they hold special events too make sure to check out their Facebook page!"}
{"text":"Definitely won't be going back. Food was OK, but the side dish was more food than the actual entree. With only about 4 other parties there I ended up cancelling my second drink because I was almost done eating and still hadn't seen it poured (just a beer, no 'fancy' cocktail) even after I ordered it when we got our food. The one bartender looked like he was on staff for a very loud party of 4 at the bar and it appeared he was drinking just as much, if not more than they were."}
{"text":"After a 7 hour drive, it was the first place I saw. Glad I stumbled in here. Food and environment was great. Ordered the shrimp tacos and a beer. Service was fast and friendly. It was decently busy at the time, but not too loud and the wait staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I've gone have all been disappointing and I can no longer consider the issues a \"one-off\". The service is terrible, they seem to go through staff quite a bit and this is usually due to poor management. The bartender couldn't even remember the price for their happy hour special, \"It's uhhh... THREE tequilas for.... a price\".   So for $7.50 I grabbed a gin tonic. I saw her pour something in, but as a bartender of nearly 10 years I can call BS as soon as I took my first sip. A) there was not a full ounce (or even 1/2 oz) poured into my drink, or B) they water down the alcohol in the bottle. It's one or the other. Unless their bartender is incompetent enough that she couldn't figure out how to put liquor in the glass.   If in a 10oz glass, mostly filled with ice, and \"topped\" with tonic, I still cannot discern ANY trace of bar-rail gin (the cheaper stuff tastes more apparent) then YES, this is one of the times they're not serving what they say they are. I've been a bartender for nearly 10 years so I f***ing dare you to tell me I'm wrong. In 5oz of liquid I would clearly be able to taste gin had it been added to the tonic. My friend abandoned his drink rather than complaining. A place this low end, there's no point.  Previous experiences were about the same. Bartenders that couldn't properly pour a draft beer, couldn't advise on prices, changed prices after the drink was served, poor attitude and a generally lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"Cool place! Good music :) Went on a Friday night for my bday. Enjoyed myself very much. Great spot to hang out"}
{"text":"I believe this place is underrated. I've been to this place a few times and I mainly go because their food is absolutely delicious. A very affordable an decent price for both alcohol and food. One my main favourite dishes are the chicken wings and their house fries. Oh let's not forget the sangria was the bomb !!! This bar should get more credit."}
{"text":"Le tequila bar, l'endroit où l'on va quand on veut souper à bon prix un peu tard dans St-Henri. le service est ok, la bouffe est ok, la sélection de bière ok. Les drinks fait à base de téquila sont assez bons, tout comme la sélection de téquila. Bref, en gang où l'on crée sa propre ambiance, cet endroit est très bien, pour un souper de couple, j'irais ailleurs."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a place with such truly terrible service. Waited 10 minutes to get menus then 15 minutes to order JUST drinks, then 25 minutes to order food and then food came about about another 20 minutes later. Food was simply okay. Cheese for nachos were in the middle/bottom of the bowl in one big cheesy mound. Tacos were decent. Not worth it at all tho. Left pretty aggravated. Oh - and what made it better is a guy who looked like a manager just standing around and looking at our table, not even offering to take our orders or anything, when his restaurant was clearly understaffed."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with this place.  The decor is lovely which is the only reason it got a second star. The staff were not on the ball at all. Actually let me take that back,the only staff member that was efficient was the busboy,kudos to him.  The margaritas were way too sweet. The grand margarita & the blackberry were weak,my friend ordered them so I got to taste them,blah. The machete one was not spicy & it didn't even have a kick to it.  We ordered the chicken quesadilla,it was ok,the flavour was ok nothing spectacular. I ordered the nachos 1-2 minutes after we placed the main order. They showed up 15 minutes after our main dish arrived & they were a mess. They were served in a narrow bowl,the veggies were all in 1 spot & the cheese was a blob at the bottom of the bowl. No layering or at the very least spreading the toppings even a little goes a long way. There's no way in hell,that I would spend 8$ for them ever again.  After receiving our food,the waitress went AWOL & we didn't see her again. Luckily,the busboy was there to give us our bills.  Probably won't go back but I might at some point give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Quite an OK place. Good variety of drinks to select from. Neighborhood does not fit in preferred choice. 2 simple recommendations- don't try nachos and do try house fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a spot to have a drink on Notre-Dame Street. We stumbled upon Le Tequila Bar by chance and learned they had opened up only 2 months ago.  At 2 AM, the place was calm and inviting. The decor was dark but alive, topped with a nice art mural. Music was playing but the volume was just right, enabling casual conversation. The bartender was friendly and attentive, which is a definite plus.   I had a Blackberry Margarita which was nice, and he had a Gin. We unfortunately did not get to try the food but we definitely plan on giving it a try in the future.   So far, so good. We enjoyed Le Tequila Bar very much as a hangout spot and we recommend it, especially if you're looking for somewhere on the quiet side to spend the evening."}
{"text":"i've only ever had the taco plate, and i'm obsessed. The sauces that come with it are delicious. We always sit at the bar the owner is really nice and friendly. It's got a great decor and a good menu selection. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar right next to Metro Cote Vertu and a stones throw from Vanier college.  Drinks range from a selection of Tequillas, draft beers or mix drinks.  As for food they have a very good selection of Mexican cuisine, and even for those looking only for a meal this is a spot worth considering.  I had their Jalapeño sliders which had just the right amount of heat in my opinion and a colleague had the Chorizo tacos which were also fantastic.  This place is likely to become a new fav for me and the staff is very friendly.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Dos Cerveza     Great little dive. I walk by hear almost every day on my way home and was always intrigued by the sign. That and the the fact that it was downstairs.     With a last minute audible to our Super Bowl plans, my girlfriend and I were adrift in a sea of nothingness hence, a call to tequila bar. Success, they had the game...and so we went.     The place appears to be newly renovated. They have Guinness on tap and a lengthily happy hour, who's hours escape me at this time. It is open, oddly shaped and very well lit(eerily so...) but if you want to get pissed, watch a game and eat some cheap wings, that are pretty good, you can't go wrong. Oh yeah and they have Tequila.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"Great place for both food and drinks, they offer a tandoori option as well and it's one of my favourites for chicken. All the ingredients are fresh and the food is always delicious! The service is on point, friendly and efficient, very nicely decorated and great music. Vast selection of various tequilas! Would recommend it to everyone. Personal favourite are the mojitos"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, awesome food!! Overall great experience. The tandoori option is def a must try along with their Mexican style poutine."}
{"text":"Went for a drink after work. I had a mojito and shared some amazing delicious nachos. They are so good!!! Super crispy, topped with cheese and grilled veggies and served with 4 different dipping sauce: guacamole, salsa, garlic and roasted pepper (I think it was roasted pepper). Those nachos were so good that I really want to try all of the food there..ill go back very soon!! Oh and the mojito was also really good; not too sweet too."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, nice atmosphere. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, bon service, bcp de tables, bcp fenetres, Salma Hayek et Antonio banderas vous attendent aux toilettes ;)"}
{"text":"I loved their home fries and their spicy dip, great with a white draft!!! Also great service."}
{"text":"The service is incredibly slow! I hope it's because it was just a busy night.  They brought water only after taking their sweet time to come take our order. And then never refilled it.  We ordered chicken tacos and chicken burritos. I gotta say the food is really good. But the portions are small for my liking. The tacos are smaller than the burrito.  The side salad is nothing special. Maybe I would opt for the rice instead if ever I come back.  Get the guac as an extra. Guac always makes everything taste better."}
