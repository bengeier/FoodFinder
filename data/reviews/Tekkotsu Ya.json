{"text":"Amazing food and service! I walked into the restaurant with a group of friends and was greeted with such kindness. The server which I think was the owner was so accommodating to everything I asked her. When I ran out of tea she was quick to notice and offered me a refill. The food also was served quickly and was delectable. I ordered the black garlic shoyu pork chashu ramen and it was the most delicious ramen I have ever tasted in Calgary. I noticed that the cooks were Japanese which I think is the reason for such an authentic ramen flavour. My friends ordered the spicy shoyu pork ramen and that was also delicous. For desert, I ordered the bonsai ice cream and it was phenomenal. It was also served so beautifully like a real bonsai. 10/10 would eat here again and for anyone tired of the restaurants down international avenue, I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to try this newer ramen in NE Calgary Tekkotsu Ya. Wanted to see if it was better than the other ramen restaurant in town. Location was pretty odd and is in the middle of condo complex, but the interior was not bad, simple, but not bad. 

Their menu looks very fancy so I ordered the jigoku ramen (spicy shoyu base). When i got the bowl it was hot (i like) the soup base is creamy and rich (not bad) but portion was a bit small for 13.50 for a bowl of ramen, it includes spinach, egg, ramen, 2 slice of pork, and seaweed.  The pork taste good but it was thin, had good flavour but i wish it was thicker... felt like hot pot beef but thinner. Ramen noodle was pretty standard, thick (wavy noodles) style. The soup was spicy, had a kick but was not too spicy. My friend got garlic soup base and all i taste was garlic... the soup on both bowl was missing something... but still okay.

Overall, Ramen here was okay."}
{"text":"First time going here after I checked that it's 4.5 stars, easily located and grabbed the only parking spot since it's the weekend. We were promptly seated with a nice and friendly lady. I ordered their raved about Black Garlic Ramen after considering all the reviews, having tasted the broth, I like the not salty version of it , the fusion of flavors from the bowl, and the portion size of the pork meat, (2 thin slices) , 2 nori, spinach, half boiled egg abed of noodles. The only thing I regret in the broth is it's a bit meager.. I won't mind it to at least cover more of the noodles, as I was used to more broth with other Ramen places. I also ordered their genmatcha tea(hot) but it's luke warm.. not even near hot considering it's in a pot when placed , first time I took a sip, it's already warm.. the soup broth isn't as nearly hot too as I'd assume. Come dessert time, we ordered lychee ice cream and the Japanese cheesecake, the ice cream is a must have here, really authentic flavor, natural and light you'd think it's a sherbet, the cheesecake on the other hand is good, but not as good as you're used to on a cheesecake since it's a little crumbly and not as creamy as you'd think but light tasting. So I don't mind. But if you're expecting the traditional cheesecake taste, you'll be a bit disappointed but with its fresh and light tasting flavors to compensate - although personally, I'd have the regular one."}
{"text":"Tekkotsu Ya is hands down my favorite Ramen place in the entire city. It is all around amazing, great portion sizes, high quality brother and amazing flavours."}
{"text":"The place is amazing I came here with a few friends the location used to be a Vietnamese restaurant that we loved and by surprise we were once again in love, but with new food. The food was delicious and the owner was so accommodating with everything we needed. Everything was so authentic and food quality was incredible. The lady definitely deserves an award for her kindness and costumer service, she was happy to help us as well as the other families. She was so passionate about everything and was giving us so much feedback! We had a variety of ramen and dessert which came quickly and tasted phenomenal. For the ramen we had spicy shoyu pork ramen and black garlic shoyu pork chashu, dessert was lychee ice cream, matcha parfait, and bonsai dessert. All was incredible and would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for authentic Japanese home cooked food! 10/10 would come back!"}
{"text":"Came here based on a good recommendation and the girlfriend found this place as a new restaurant along 17th Ave.  It's located across from Elliston Park used to be a pretty good Vietnamese restaurant which relocated last year.

We ordered the Hojicha which is toasted green tea and it came in a really cool teapot.  Tasted OK, nothing special.  It was a very light since we only ordered one to share on a chilly day.  We got the Black Garlic Pork ramen with Shoyu broth and the Black Garlic Chicken ramen with Shio broth in a combo with Chicken karaage and Chasu don.  

The fried chicken was alright, I appreciate that it was evidently homemade.  But our city has pretty damn good fried chicken nowadays and this place can't really stand up to those other places.  The Chasu don was pretty good value especially if you like to eat a ton.  It came with alot of Chasu and rice, we really liked mixing the spicy mayo that came with the fried chicken into our rice bowl.

We came here to try their ramen and it definitely delivered.  The broth by itself had very good and clean pork/chicken flavors.  We actually regret getting the black garlic since it overwhelmed the natural flavor of the broth.  The girlfriend usually finds ramen broth to be salty (I love my sodium) and this place was no exception, but if you ask them they will add additional unsalted broth for you.  Their toppings and noodles were nothing amazing, but the broth really stood out and they have a choice between thick and thin ramen noodles.

Since we were both stuffed, we ordered the parfait to share.  It was pretty good and came with two scoops of matcha ice cream, topped with red beans, matcha powder and mochi balls. 

Can't wait to come back and try the special ramen and their gyoza.  But most likely will end up getting their basic shio/shoyu ramen since you can really taste the meat flavor in their broth."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best ramen I have had in Calgary. I was really impressed. I had the black garlic ramen with pork and the korekke and both were delicious. They also have very good floats. Service is incredibly fast. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try out Tekkotsu Ya as it was a new ramen place and have read great reviews. 

The restaurant itself is pretty clean and organized. Their decor was neat and the ambiance was great too, good for families and dates.

We ordered 2 ramen bowls(one spicy and one regular, both shoyu). The broth was good, but it tasted kind of flat. The noodles and toppings were good, but I wished they put less seaweed paper and more toppings. I personally would have liked more veggies. The wooden spoons they provide have paint chipping off of the them and coming in contact with my ramen. 

The service was great and very excellent speed in which our food came out. 

Their washroom is a bit of a mess and definitely needs some renovations and clean up.

Overall, I would probably come back and try their rice plates and see if those are any good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best ramen I've tried yet! I've been to Shiki Menya, Jinya, Goro + Gun and Muku...and although in their own right they are all good; Tekkotsu has just shot up to the top of my list for best ramen! 

I ordered the Shoyu Pork Chashu Black Garlic ramen and I was blown away. Ramen lovers always say \"it's all about the broth.\" Well, Tekkotsu Ya nails it! Their broth is absolutely slurp worthy. Rich, smooth and full of flavor with tender noodles, perfectly seasoned egg, and a couple sheets of seaweed to round out that unami flavor goodness. I finished the entire bowl right down to the last drop of broth. 

Afterwards, we ordered practically their whole dessert menu (4 of the 5). We ordered the coffee pudding, parfait, lychee ice cream and green tea cheesecake. All were delicious but what stole the show was the lychee ice cream and cheesecake.  Lychee is one of my favorite flavors and this ice cream is the best I've ever had. It's creamy with pieces of lychee fruit. The restaurant owner has it shipped in special. So although yes you can get lychee ice cream else where, you won't get it like the one at Tekkotsu! The green tea cheesecake was also amazing. Light, creamy and not too sweet without an overpowering grassy green tea flavor. It had just the right balance of sweetness and flavor. 

One thing that struck me about this restaurant was the owner's passion to have the best of everything. She's a warm and jolly person who comes out and greets all the patrons and asks for feedback. You can tell she takes a lot of pride in serving the best food she can. 

The restaurant is in a very inconspicuous area, one may even classify it as a \"hole in the wall.\" Definitely a destination, but well worth the commute if it's far from where you are. Come support this business but also come prepared to eat well! Tekkotsu has great service with even better food. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great ramen shop in Calgary! It's one of those gems you find once in a blue moon. The place looks very neat and the server is very friendly and accodating while the food gets delivered extremely quickly.

Went with my girlfriend and her family and they all loved it. Ordered the black garlic chicken ramen with extra noodles, while my girlfriend and her family did the chicken classic shoyu ramen. We all definitely got a healthy serving and the extra noodles I received essentially gave me 2 bowls of ramen. I also had the matcha float which was very tasty and we ordered lychee and their bonsai ice cream (which literally looked like a potted plant.) Both were amazing and the bonsai ice cream was unique and flavorful enough for me to want to try it again in the future.

10/10 will go here again for good ramen!"}
