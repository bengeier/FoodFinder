{"text":"We just finished a round of golf and went to the grille for lunch. We had 2 burgers, a patty melt and Cuban sandwich. The staff was great, the food was delivered fast and hot and was very very very good.  Enjoy lunch here definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Beautiful views.  Nice menu.  Had lunch on patio.  Loved that it was not crowded with a hundred tables crammed in.  Could enjoy the desert and conversations with friends.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"Good burger and really good (I believe) homemade chips. Tasty but expensive. The patty is probably a commonly purchased frozen patty from Costco or a food service supplier. Again, good, but not unique in any way and pricey."}
{"text":"Cute place with some nice views. The breakfast menu is small and nothing outstanding, everything was good and our waitress Lia was wonderful. The bacon was crisp and the waffles were tasty. The sausage links were nicely cooked and the portions were perfectly sized. Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Wait service delivered main course, never were served out appetizers.  We had to physically walk to the bar to get drinks because service was so bad. My chili was served burnt, my wife's Asian chicken salad was bland.  Won't come back for food or drink"}
{"text":"A nice walk up the hill from the We-Ko-Pa resort.  Sat outside, nice setting, decent view of the golf course.    I had the fish tacos. Nice salsa, good baja sauce.  The fish was a tad fishy, but fine.  Tortillas were nice and the service good."}
