{"text":"I've always loved Mac's Sushi as probably the best fast-food sushi available.   However, this location is not as good. However I still would have given it four stars if it wasn't for their extreme stinginess for spicy mayo. Even when you pay 60 cents extra, the quantity they give is minuscule! Very disappointing!!!  Not bad overall though."}
{"text":"i like how the sushi is nice and fresh. i really like the boss and he is really nice to me. i really recommend this place. :). (from my 10 year old daughter who love sushi so much)"}
{"text":"Great and friendly  I usually go this shop after 5pm. Because of 30% off deal. Their sashimi is almost same as expensive restaurants"}
{"text":"I was struggling with whether I should give this place 3 stars or 4 stars, but in the end, I went with 4 stars and I will tell you why.  Overall, the sushi is just ok - very underwhelming when compared to the sushi you get at a restaurant. However, this isn't a sit down sushi restaurant where food is made to order. It's a \"fast food\" sushi takeout place in a mall food court.  The sushi is made throughout the day and kept in pre-made trays that you just grab and pay for at the cash register. It's very quick, easy, and convenient.   Anyways, the sushi is not the greatest, but when compared to other pre-made to go sushi trays (like the ones you may pick up at like a Metro, Sobey's, or Loblaws), this sushi is much better than those.  The rice is sometimes dry but the fish is ok and the whole meal is acceptable - even borderline good, but not quite there.  The main reason I keep coming back is it's cheaper than going to a sit down sushi place, and if you catch the End of the Day Special, you'll get a lot of sushi for a good price. The special usually begins a few hours before the mall closes.  In addition, they have given me free food at this location as a thank you when I would buy a lot of sushi all at once.  Tonight, I took advantage of their End of Day Special and purchased two trays of sushi for $14 that would have easily cost $20+ if I got it at a restaurant.  So, in spite of the mediocre sushi, I must admit the End of Day Special, the great service, convenient location, and the fact that it's better than other pre-made sushi places makes this location one of my regular places to grab sushi.  So for me, this is a 4 star place (but barely)."}
{"text":"Best Mac's Sushi I've been to. Owner is always smiling, ingredients and rice taste fresh everytime!  The best part is their end of the day sale. Their 2 for $8 or 2 for $10 is a great deal when I'm on my way home!"}
{"text":"For campus sushi i have to say this is up there with other good sushi restauraunts.   The service is pretty awesome and a smile goes a long way. Its definitely not like the other fast food sushi like Sushi Bento and Sushi Q, you can actually see them making rolls fresh right in front of you.   The selection is varied and its my go to when im craving some fish."}
{"text":"Fresh fish and not your average boxed sushi! I'm surprised at the superb quality for a take out place.   With so many burger joints and greasy foods, it's a nice change of pace to have something that's not fried. The assortment is great and options for those who like raw fish and those who don't.   They also have a good variety of cool Japanese/korean drink imports. Love the Ramune!  Great place to go for some kpop and fresh food.  Also, if you want dessert, they've got taiyaki waffles!!!"}
{"text":"I really like visiting this to-go sushi restaurant after a long day of shopping. Mac's sushi provides a really quick and easy meal I can pick up to eat in the mall or take home.   I usually venture here when the mall is closing and get to participate in their end of day sale where sushi is 20% + off so they can clear it out.  It's a really good deal!"}
{"text":"Although this is my first time at Macs Sushi at a Erin Mills Town Centre, Mississauga I am giving them 5/5 stars. They have masterful sushi makers, friendly staff and delicious sushi! Everything is fresh, visually stunning and tastes fantastic. Great selection, something for every taste. Price is average for sushi restaurants. Terrific attention to detail as the pink ginger is fashioned into a lovely rose!"}
{"text":"This location is on the second level of the York University Student Centre food court. It's a bit hidden, so maybe hard to find, you just need to find the stairs going up at the far end of the food court.   They have fresh sashimi and a variety of rolls. They also have seaweed salad and edamame. For a location in a food court, the quality of their sushi is really not that bad. I like how the rolls are not over-stuffed with rice but has a lot of fish and other ingredients. The ingredients seem fresh and the rolls do not seem to have sat in the shelf for a long time, not dried up at all, unlike what you might find in the cafeterias on campus. Everything is neatly packaged and displayed, so you can see and pick the exact one you want. I got a small box of spicy salmon roll, it has six pieces for $6.49. The fish was tasty and as I said not too much rice and with a kick of spice, overall very flavourful.   The price is a bit pricey, but it's on par with everything else on campus, so if you are stuck here, you really don't have that many choices. It's still a food court, so you won't get comfortable seating, and the food court is a bit old and dated. However, what gave them an extra star from me is the great service. The cashier was courteous and all smiles, and asked me if I wanted a bag for my small box of sushi. That was a nice touch to end the transaction and would really motivate me to come back here for more. A simple smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled by AYCE sushi restaurants and the idea of ordering maki rolls a-la carte does not appeal to me at all. Nevertheless I sometimes pay them a visit for avocado rolls. Service is very friendly. 30% off after 5pm."}
{"text":"Was utterly surprised on the quality of sushi that came from this mall. It was great to see sushi made infront of my eyes as you never know with raw fish. I was most surprised with the flavor. Flavored rice and fresh sushi go so well together, there isn't a sushi place around town that does this.   Never the less if you are hungry want a quick bite to eat  ut know that you are getting your money's worth I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I would give this place a higher score since I mean common, it's fast food sushi. It's decent but not amazing.  Not bad either.  Basically what you would expect from a sushi-to-go place.  So long as you are smart about it, you can always get freshly made sushi but it doesn't taste super fresh.  Anyway, enjoy if you decide to check it out but down get your hopes up."}
{"text":"This is THREE TIMES BETTER than the next best Macs Sushi I've been to in Ontario! Owner/sushi chefs here actually care about their work.  Let's not kid ourselves, this isn't Miku or something. But it's by far the best food court sushi I've ever had. Most Macs' sushi is barely even edible, a handful are tolerable, but here it's actually decently good. I wouldn't believe it if you told me--I figured at York University, in a student food court, it must be the worst out of them all--but I regret that preconception. It's honestly amazing for what it is.  It's easily on par with the decent-and-slightly-worse cheap AYCE sushi restaurants downtown, which is saying something. Any good sushi place or luxury place like Miku obviously blows it away, but for the convenience it's great, and way better than its brethren."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Mac's Sushi! Service, quality are both great. My husband and I often thought about trying their end of night sale and when we finally did, we have been hooked ever since!  We've done the end of day sale about 5 times now and each time has been a great experience.  Nearly each time we've gone and chosen our rolls from the display, the cashier has told us that they are making fresh versions of a selected roll and she's given us the freshly made one! Even with it being 8pm, we've gotten a freshly made California roll, or crab roll, or spicy salmon depending on what they had in the fridge that needed to be used up. We've even gotten free edamame a couple times.  Aside from the freebies, the quality of food is good too. The rolls are not overly rice heavy which can be the case at most food court sushi places. It's a good filling to rice ratio. Sashimi pieces have also been decent sized cuts and not overly thin, which again, happens at other food court places.  The cashier always bags cutlery, soy sauce, little trays for your soy too!  Overall, a consistently pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't accommodate a cucumber allergy. How hard is it to make a California roll without cucumber?"}
{"text":"The Best Sushi stand that I've ever been to. The food tastes like it came out of a Japanese restaurant and the manager there is such a joy to watch!"}
{"text":"Sushi is made fresh! For a food court sushi, it beats most of the sushi restaurants/all you can eats in the area.   You can also ask them make what you like. They have an Amazing and friendly service."}
{"text":"Service is okay, but the food was terrible. I found hair in my sushi. This place uses lettuce inside their sushi rolls (who does that?!). And, the price is high for what they offer."}
{"text":"A nice place to grab freshly made sushi. The staff were nice and helpful. You can request a customized sushi based on your liking. I always go there to grab their end of the day special, 2 for $15."}
{"text":"Great spot!   Staff are always fantastic.   Owners too.   They go out of their way to help you.   One of the few places that I miss in Mississauga!   Sushi is very good,  love the green dragon roll.   Love the sale every day at 6 pm!   Cheers guys... Miss you!"}
{"text":"Totally garbage. Especially their end of day sushi is supposed to be end of month sushi. Rice is too dry and solid like a metal, your stomach cannot melt this. Never try this store. The sushi I had today is the worst food ever (including the food I made) in my life seriously."}
