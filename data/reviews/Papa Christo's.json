{"text":"Well today i walked over to papa christos hoping that it was finally open again and it was. The place was closed for a while for renovation.  The new image looks good and now you can get your own refills. I usually order a sandwich although i some times take advantage of the pizza deal. The menu has changed and some of the great sandwiches are not listed anymore. This place has always been on the top of my list for affordable places to eat downtown, and being a family owned and operated restaurant quality is usually high. I ordered the Italian chicken pesto which is one of my favorites and well i was disappointed. I understand that the prices were up to pay for the renovation but the quality is also paying the price. The sandwich was a noticeably smaller the bread was not a ciabata bread that its usually served over and the chicken portion was less that ussual. It had a different taste in all. Maybe they are using cheaper ingredients i dont know. Needless to say i hope they really reconsider to keep the food quality and quantity if they are raising the prices. I will still come here again but it won't be my first choice for lunch."}
{"text":"When I used to work in downtown Phoenix I'd come here for lunch if I hadn't brought mine. I'd always get the pasta special which comes with the pasta, soup, bread stick, and a drink. You can get a free refill.

A few times I got a breakfast burrito there and they're made to order. They were decent.

Its unfortunate that this is the only affordable place to eat anything in downtown Phoenix. Sometimes Sheriff Joe and his security team eat here if you'd like to catch a glimpse of him.

On rare occasions the owners are rude. But that's rare so maybe they were having a bad day."}
{"text":"Bomb food ..
Why go to fast food it's fast here and fresh
Great food and there prices are perfect"}
{"text":"I was sort of disappointed with Papa Christo's because the signs around downtown directing you to their place state they have Chicago- style pizza. There's nothing Chicago-y about it. And the sausage is awful...those little balls that taste exactly like the type of sausage you get on a frozen pizza from a grocery store...exactly.

The plain cheese is much better. The cheese has a slight tartness to it that makes it pretty tasty, like a mild kasseri. But even though the puffy crust is beautiful to look at it doesn't have any taste, very bland.

Papa Christo's serves Vienna Beef brand hotdogs so of course those are delicious. You can't go wrong with that brand.

I got the lunch special which is $5.50 (with tax it comes to $6 even). You get two slices of pizza and a fountain drink. 

The two guys who work behind the counter are very friendly and helpful and keep everything running smoothly even when it's busy. 

And it does get busy. Every table inside the place was packed when I was there and even though there are tables outside, I got the last one. The outside tables aren't exclusively Papa Christo's though, they're part of  Renaissance Square so people who work in the surrounding buildings relax there with their sack lunches. I'd say don't expect seating if you get there at lunchtime, especially 12 to 1. You can sit on the little two foot wall that surrounds the mini-park a few hundred yards away but it seems to attract characters. There were two homeless people really getting busy in there... it makes you think about the phrase \"get a room\", I guess they have nowhere else to go. 

Papa Christo's opens at 7am for breakfast but closes at 3 in the afternoon  and are only open Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"Great Lunch Special! 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $6  AMAZING
Great flavor texture and temperature
they have Italian food and sandwiches too.
The service is always great I go once every week or so."}
{"text":"I had the pizza special, which is 2 slices and a medium soda for 6 bucks. Overall, the pizza was pretty good. The crust is not your typical crust, it is thick and doughy. But if you like double dough or double crust, then you will like it. The ingredients were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Didn't make it in on time for my pick order, was able to reschedule it."}
{"text":"Great family business.  I've been coming for lunch for a year now.  They have fresh soups and specials that change daily...the variety and price keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice ma and pa pizza joint, great pizza special."}
{"text":"I stopped in and tried the Italian sandwich. Just the right amount of food for an affordable price. The jalape√±o cheddar bread was to die for! My sandwich was made fresh to order and in a quick, timely manner. I will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great home made food!  Variety of daily specials that are delicious and cheap for downtown Phx.  Their pizza is awesome!  Thick chewy crust and fresh ingredients.  Get there early, the pizza is made from scratch daily and once they run out there is nothing until the next day.  Nice central location, close to everything."}
{"text":"Okay this place is a solid joint for a quick downtown lunch that won't cost you much. The pizza looks wonderful from the windows... I suspect they get a lot of customers who are walking by with the beautiful looking pizza. Sadly I can say that while the pizza isn't horrible it's not as good as it looks. It's alright pizza... and sometimes you are alright with alright pizza. They had a lot of other menu choices so when I have a chance I'll check them out. They also have a pretty good deal for a downtown place 2 slices and drink for $6 even which if you know anything about downtown is hard to beat. The staff was friendly as well. So I'll be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Great little Italian spot!  We were in town for a volleyball tournament.  I worked directly with the manager, Eric, to order catering for our volleyball team.  We ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad, Fettuccine Alfredo and Pepperoni Pizza.  Everything was delicious and the girls were quite satisfied and refueled for the next day's tournament!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and a beautiful environment.  Friendly family owned place, good prices, lots of great options.  Could eat here every day of the week!"}
{"text":"This is a Downtown Phoenix lunch joint so the hours are very limited, basically it's only open for business people on their lunch hour. They are a super cute Italian mom & pop (real Italians from Italy) place. The menu is a veritable whats what of meat-lovers foods: pizzas, cheese steaks, Italian hot and cold sandwiches, etc. So I'm vegetarian and they were very nice about making me some pasta with marinara sauce. The sauce was yummy and flavorful with garlic and the perfect spices. In order to write this review I consulted my coworkers (who do eat meat) and they assured me that the pizza and other meat items are equally delicious."}
{"text":"Just had some FANTASTIC pizza at Papa Christos. It's PACKED for lunch every day of the week. There's a reason why locals keep coming back. 

My wife and I had pepperoni and the vegie pizza with spinach, feta and mushrooms. 

Excellent! Very fresh ingredients. Hot out of the oven. Served fast.

Met the owner (Horatio). He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned."}
{"text":"I have been back a couple of times and I find the food delicious and very affordable. I reccomend the spinach feta pizza.  I also reccomend the ham sandwich.  It was toasty and delicious.  

I am a fan!"}
{"text":"The people at Papa Christo's are so nice I had to give them 4 stars. They are so warm and endearing you feel like you walked into your mother's kitchen. I ordered the pizza special: Any 2 slices with a free medium drink for $5.99. GREAT deal. The pizza slices are thick and both were yummy today - I even ate the crust!"}
{"text":"For $6 after tax I got a medium drink and 2 huge slices of fresh pizza and this has to be one of the best slices of cheese pizza I've ever eaten! You can taste the herbs, the crust is perfect and it's an AWESOME value!!! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is the best bang for your buck pizza in downtown Phoenix.  $6 ($5.45 plus tax I think) gets you stuffed on homemade DECENT pizza and a soda...a great lunch on a budget.

It's about 3 blocks from my office so I love to walk down here and grab a quick couple slices and soda.  They usually have 5 or 6 different varieties out - a couple vegetarian options which I've never tried becuase let's be honest, why would I?  My favorite is probably their pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.

They do sell out of their pizza so you wanna get there during the rush if that's what you want...I got there at about 1:15 and they were sold out today - he said they sold out at 12:45...that's a little earlier than usual I think, but even if you get there late the pizza just isn't as fresh.

I got a turkey/ham sandwich special today.  $6.50 and it came with a soda and a cup of the homemade chicken and dumpling soup.  Great flavor and SO filling!  The sandwich was fantastic (even though absolutely not what I felt like eating) - it had some kind of oil or dressing on it that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was way better than the mustard/mayo I was expecting.

I was shocked to see a review on here criticizing the owners...these are by the far the nicest and most polite family owned restaurant I've ever seen.  My friend and I have a game where we like to see how many times they say \"Thank you.\"  Sometimes you might get thanked 10 times!  They really do show that they appreciate your business and choosing their restaurant.

As always, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Recently catered from here for about 40 people, & Eric took care of us tremendously well! We came from out of town (CA) for a ballet festival at the Phoenix Convention Center. The chicken alfredo was a big hit! And the meatballs for the spaghetti were huge, plentiful, & flavorful! They put together a beautiful salad with lots of fresh vegetables. We had so much leftover that we were able to feed the late night hotel staff where we were staying, & they loved the food as well! We catered from different places all week long, but Papa Christos was definitely our favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast burrito in downtown Phoenix. They are actually open at 6:30 am. My go-to for breakfast when I'm in town for work."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. Fresh ingredients in both the pizza and the pasta.  I've tried different menu items and you can't go wrong with anything you order. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  Fast service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We discovered the breakfast special during our morning stroll to our usual spot and decided to check it out. The special included 2 eggs, toast, country potatoes and a small coffee for $2.75. The breakfast was very home-style, reminded me of breakfast your mom would make while on a camping trip. We sat, caught up on the latest corporate buzz and watched a little Good Morning America on the flat screen television. Kelly Clarkson was about to perform her new smash single \"Stronger\". It's a nice catchy tune.  I've never been a fan but this song makes me like her just a little more. 

Aside from the breakfast special, they serve additional items like egg sandwiches, breakfast burritos, pizza, Philly cheese steak and other random food items."}
{"text":"Good soups. They have stuffed peppers on Thursdays. One of my favorite downtown lunches."}
{"text":"It's a good place to get a quick (and yummy) lunch. Their pizza's good and the portions are great.
They also have sandwiches and soup but pizza's the only thing I've had from their restaurant and I have absolutely no complains.  The staff's nice too.

Good place to grab a quick bite if you're Downtown Phoenix and want to have some yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza by-the-slice, and it sucks.

The pizza crust is spongy and the rest of the pizza just lacks much flavor at all.  They have a \"two slices and soda\" lunch special which, if I recall correctly, is under $6.  If you just need to fill your gut with something ... why not?

It's just rather depressing that there's really no good place to get a decent slice in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Family owned Italian food. They always greet you with a smile, low-prices, and great food. I walk here almost every day for lunch."}
{"text":"Delish food and a little something for everyone. I love that they have healthy options and good portion sizes. Honestly the new menu options are amazing"}
{"text":"First things first - the pizza LOOKS better than it tastes.  As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.  
The cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.  
I got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, \"Oh.\"
I could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.  
So now I know all that glitters isn't gold.
Now on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to.
I went again the next day.
This time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus.
It was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had.
And like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good!
Two things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices.
The lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.  
The prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.  
There is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too. 
So to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.  A neat place."}
{"text":"Geoff B., I had a similar bad experience.
I ordered a chicken sandwich at this restaurant without mayo -- after waiting quite a while (I was one of two people in line), I finally received my sandwich. I checked the sandwich outside, just to be sure it had no mayo...it did. I returned, told the man who took my order (perhaps the owner?) that the sandwich had mayo -- he grabbed it from my hands, and gave it to one of his workers, who then came back with it about two minutes later. I thanked him and left. I again checked the sandwich when I got outside, and saw that the bread had been replaced, but mayo was still all over the chicken. I returned to the restaurant and told the man that it still had mayo, the man yelled at me and slammed the sandwich on the counter, insisting the sandwich did not have mayo. I showed him that mayo was still all over the chicken and asked for my money back -- a nicer man from the back of the restaurant thankfully came out and apologized and returned my money. 
Perhaps it's time for the younger gentleman to take over management of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland.  Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try."}
{"text":"Small little Mom and Pop restaurant, nothing fancy, pasta and salad was so so but the pizza was tasty. Friendly, fast service and good lunch specials."}
{"text":"This pizza place is very affordable and convenient.. Two deep dish slices and a drink for 5.99!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I like that it's family-owned. I like that they redid the restaurant. I like that they redid their menu. What makes me hesitate everytime I think of going there is there choice of television channels. If you don't like the show called the dish or the crap or whatever it's called played in a small room on two televisions at near full volume then you won't like this place. If you like hearing people discuss, at the top of their lungs, the latest thing that's \"Aaaa-mazing\" then you will love this place.
Get your food to go and I guess you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This place may be overlooked, but it's kind of nice because it doesn't get the lunch traffic! This mini cafe has great pizza, wings, salads all for a decent price. I had 2 slices of pizza and a coke for around $7! It was delicious. Very filling! Everyone there that I've encountered so far is very nice. It's located within Renaissance square"}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast, it's conveniently located and Cipriano is always helpful.
I usually get the PC eye opener and it's 2 eggs, potatoes, toast and coffee for only $3 you can't beat that!
It's a great place to eat it take out and I've always been satisfied with the freshly make food and friendly customer service by owner.
Get your own eye opener!"}
{"text":"Woking just a block away I try to vary my lunch options (when I forget or was too lazy to pack my lunch).  I have been here twice and both times just got the lunch pizza special (2 slices and a soda for $6).  

The slices are large, the crust thick the sauce and toppings are (good) average.  On both occasions I took a piece of pizza home for later.  There are more options on the menu and offer more than one special for lunch usually.  Even when super busy during the lunch hour I have found the service to be quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Good and cheap lunch specials. Be warned, the pizza is giant puffy slices. I'm not a huge fan of this style of pizza, but it was decent, cheap and fast for lunch."}
{"text":"pizza is good and you can get 2 big slices with the lunch special, friendly, family owned restuarant"}
{"text":"When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!"}
