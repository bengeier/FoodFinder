{"text":"Best experience! The complimentary tea is a nice touch. I'm so lucky I live right by here! On Friday's even open til 2AM! Seriously good times!"}
{"text":"Placed a skip the dish order (I live close by) and wanted support a local business.. sadly the food was beyond horrible. Tasteless ! End up throwing it away..  Chicken tasted like it was boiled in water with salt = suppose to be chicken shawarma  Falafel tasted like just raw flour dough - no chickpeas   Fries - they even managed to mess up a simple fries order - soggy + tasted like it just came out of a frozen bag and had no salt !  Kabab wrap -it had tomatoes + lettuce and God knows what that meat was from  Salad - not sure what they put on it but tasted like dead ants ?? Super grossed out by this"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Tea offered while waited for fresh, crispy, perfectly seasoned falafel and chicken shawarma"}
