{"text":"Overall: Asian fusion buns with a unique flavor profile twist that includes earl grey, matcha, Hong Kong style, Japanese,  Tawainese and French.

Sample: there are  bread samples for you to taste before you buy

Cleaniness: unlike other Chinese bakeries that reuse the trays and tongs, they do clean it before reusing

Cost: range from about $ 2.90-5$ for buns- I didn't check the pastries

Taste:  bought the Earl grey twist, matcha red bean bun and it tasted great.

Value and would I come back:  probably not - the price seems a bit inflated.  For a one time experience for breakfast or snack, it's not a bad idea."}
{"text":"Yummy bread and they are generous with the samples so you're sure to purchase a bread you like! It's very small so getting a seat is a rarity, but it's a cute little spot to check out"}
{"text":"Loved the baked goods we got here. Especially the Gangnam Star, which has kimchi and cream cheese filling. Loved that they had little samples of the breads so that we can try."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, Chatime was the reason I stepped in here.

But once I entered, it was like bread heaven! Lots of different breads and pastries, most with an Asian ingredient influence (goji berries, taro, mango, green tea, etc). My favourite was the Earl Gray tea breadstick (a soft bread loaf filled with a fragrant earl gray pastry cream), and the chocolate loaf (was this bread, or a chocolate bar? YUM.)

Also tried the mille crepe here, which was decent but kind of expensive at $8 a piece."}
{"text":"Amazing buns and bread :) I always come here for their teaspressos though. I feel like not enough people know about this! Its basically a tea version of an espresso (duh! :P). Super strong tea taste but never bitter. Such an amazing find! Highly recommend to all fellow tea lovers!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. 
I dropped by around 9:30 Saturday morning (not like terribly early). Half of the price/name tags were still missing. So I kind of had to go with recognizable baked goods, which did not blow my mind (the total price kind of did). I got a raisin/nut bun (?), chocolate croissant and a danish. Danish pastry was nice and flaky. The bun was a bit too moist on the inside and had this strange aroma (not that it wasn't super fresh, it totally was!), I'm not sure if it's a different kind of yeast or an oriental fruit that has been added to the dough, but the to me it did not quite mix with the expected flavours of raisin-cranberry-walnut bun. Btw, the walnut was not mentioned on the price/name tag, so thankfully I tried it myself before giving it to my son (he's allergic).
There were not paper bags or cardboard boxes for my purchase and the sticky pastries went into a plastic bag - which is not a very good idea.

Anyway, I guess this bakery is just too Asian for me :) I'm still on a lookout for a no nonsense simple good bakery in North York."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cozy.  They have an interesting - albeit somewhat small - selection of Asian-style baked goods and pastries, including a matcha black sesame cake that actually tasted of both, and wasn't too sweet.  Their cheesecake also looked delicious (looked basically like the Uncle Tetsu ones), although I didn't actually get one.  

There are about 4-5 tables inside, and another 7-8 outside, although I found the exterior chairs and tables a bit cramped for the space; you end up having to climb over a bunch of chairs and tables to get to a table, and again to throw out your garbage afterwards.

The staff are also helpful enough when you ask them questions, and it even has a very clean washroom for customers!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Good products.  Friday May 13, 2016.  To the rachet asian bitch in line, you are a rotted cunt.  You are a fobby human piece of shit.  Enjoy and choke on your tax free cakes, you and your big pimping boyfriend deserve them.  Fucking miserable bitch, please and thanks, you deserve none.  Eat my fishy  pussyyyyyy"}
{"text":"dropped here tonight, the cake was so good, especially they have chatime milk tea, too, my favourite, so yummy"}
{"text":"Way over-priced for bread and coffee. Three month after visiting this place, my husband is still shocked with the price of their bread and especially coffee. 
Their bread tastes good but there are a lot of other bakeries (Italian, French, Portuguese) that make and sell great bread with less prices in Toronto. If I pay high price for bakery, I'd rather go to Mon K Pattiserie in Coxwell. I drive 30 min every weekend to get bread from Mon K. I never visited Bake Code again after our first trip there even though the store is closer to my area."}
{"text":"I went there today and ordered 3 pieces of cake with mocha to go .. When I got home I only found 2 pieces! .. I liked the taste but disappointed with the missing one that I paid for it!!"}
{"text":"I'm quite disappointed on my last two visit. Normally I go there to purchase a hot classic pearl milk tea w normal sugar before work. Although I was charged correctly and the drink maker points out that it's a pearl milk tea when it's ready, I find out there's no tapioca once the drink cools down and I start to sip inside Sheppard station. Don't get me wrong. The tea tastes good but it's not the same without the bubbles. (; _ ;)"}
{"text":"Checked it out on a Wednesday night - half of the selection was gone already. The half baked matcha castella cake was not as impressive as it sounds - a bit overly sweet, and tasted raw. The egg-yolk croissant was creative in a good way, but the gochi roll was not. Would like to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Came here mid-afternoon on a Wednesday and they had a pretty big selection of bread. My friends and I decided to get a bunch of everything to share. 

I liked the neat decor and the fact that it has lots of window and a decent amount of sitting space for a bakery. It even has a patio for when the weather gets nicer. Service was nice although they seemed annoyed/overwhelmed by our order size (we had 5 people in our party).

The breads were pretty decent. Lots of variety and interesting flavours. Surprisingly, out of all the unique ones we tried taro ended up being my favourite. It was pretty sweet and crunchy. Perfect for snacking. Some of the other ones had too much going on and I wasn't a fan of the cream cheese ones. 

We also ordered quite a few drinks. Some tried the standard chatime drinks and it tasted the same as other locations. What disappointed me the most were their bake code speciality drinks. Personally, I got the milk tea espresso latte, which sounds super fancy but not really. It's an espresso because they made the tea with an espresso machine, which presotea has been doing all along. I wouldn't have mind that they did it in a similar fashion if the tea had been good but it just tasted watered down to me. Also, the latte part was just a milk foam put on top that you're supposed to mix in. It didn't really add anything to the drink except maybe make it look prettier. 

Might come back to try some of the cakes but definitely wouldn't bother with the drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Bake Code on July 14 at 8:30pm. 

I had called 1 hour before my arrival to confirm if they had any more Molten Salted Egg Yolk Croissants and the man I spoke to confirmed that they had 4 left. I asked if he can put it on hold for me and I will arrive in an hour to pick them up. I even offered to pay them over the phone via credit card to make sure they weren't sold. He said it would be okay and he would hold them for me and hung up the phone. When I arrived an hour later I told the woman at the counter that I had called and placed four of the croissants on hold. There was definitely a language barrier because instead of checking the back, she pointed to the display where they were. I noted that there were only two left. After grabbing those ones (before they got sold), I went back to the counter and explained once again that I expected four of them because I called and spoke to a man who said he would put them on hold. She looked around briefly for them and came back and said there was nothing on hold. I saw only one man working this whole time I was in the shop and pointed out to her that he must have been the person I spoke to. She neither confirmed or denied it nor did she ask him or have him speak to me and merely apologized. 

I was extremely disappointed in the level of service at Bake Code. Not only did I make sure to call in advance, they promised to put them on hold. The person who I spoke to didn't even speak to me. While the croissants are good (though somewhat overpriced at $4.90+tax each), this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure I would return."}
{"text":"So good, Worth checking out for the dozens of samples alone."}
{"text":"I came here mid-afternoon and the bread display was a mess. Staff members were just chatting with each other and walking around so I don't understand why they couldn't have cleaned up the place and done a better job displaying the breads? Also, when I purchased my cakes, they jammed it into a tiny box. Upon opening the boxes, the cakes were not in a condition I would have preferred them to be in...especially considering I paid a pricy amount for them. I just think the overall service of the place could be a lot better. Definitely needs work."}
{"text":"SHOCKING FOOD HANDLING PRACTICES 

Gross. Everything seems nice when you first come in but they definitely have some food handling problems. And lack of sanitation / food safety training for their staff.

I came in one rainy night and bought some baked goods. It was not bad, but not great. While I was sitting there, this woman comes in from outside in the rain with a bag. She takes out a pastry that she claims she got there. Think she mentioned she got two of a certain type of buns and she tried it and didn't like it, so she wanted to exchange for another one. Anyways the guy working there lets her and the bun she gives back is placed behind the counter. Shortly after, another girl working there takes that bun and puts it back out for sale, which I thought was really disgusting. Who knows what that lady had done with it or how old it's been?! How could you put it back out for sale? Terrible.

A little more time has passed, the guy comes back and asks the the girl where the bun is and if she put it back out for sale. Here, I thought the guy would have lectured her that this is not proper food sanitation practice. But then he goes and takes another random bun from the counter and asks if she can put another one back out as well !!! Maybe one that someone hasn't finished eating and left on the table ? Maybe another bun that someone has \"returned\"? Maybe one that someone licked? Or one that has fallen on the floor? Who knows. But I wouldn't trust the pastries here."}
{"text":"This spot is great for a little chatime and for a bake good. I liked the Millie crepe they sell here. The cake isn't overpowering sweet. Also the earl grey flute was very interesting. But also tasty and sweet. I find the a whole roll might me too sweet because it's so long.  But if you purchase half of the roll it is worth it."}
{"text":"What are the rules of the Bake Code?  I have no idea, but I know that following the code results in some great baked goods!
Bake Code is  a new bakery at Yonge and Sheppard that has been a long time coming in a busy neighbourhood that has been devoid of any quality bakeries.  This bakery is a welcome addition as it offers good quality and interesting baked goods although (as mentioned in other reviews), the prices are slightly on the high side.
As mentioned on their website, Bake Code \"combines traditional European baking techniques with Asian pastry recipes\" and this combination makes for some delicious and interesting breads and pastries.
I have tried several items and have generally enjoyed everything I have tried.  Among these items, there have been some outstanding hits (Earl Grey Tea Flute, Ham Crescent, Gangnam Star, Espresso bread) without any real disappointments.  I thought the Mentaiko Baguette was a little weird as it is a \"fish\" flavoured bread, however my wife really enjoyed it.  For those who are doubtful and like to be absolutely sure before they purchase their bread, there is the option to sample most of the breads before you commit to buying.
Since the bakery is new and there are no other alternatives in the vicinity, the place is usually quite busy, but the service is mostly efficient and definitely very friendly.
I was never aware that there was a particular \"code\" to follow when baking, but if the breads and pastries at Bake Code are any indication, following the rules of the bake code produces great results.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"got millie crepe cake today.... all i can say is very disappointed. they should do a better job when charging ppl a $8 per piece"}
{"text":"Overall: 3.0

Food was good, same goes with the service. But in this economy, paying $6.00 for a Chinese raisin roll or pineapple bun is not worth it.

Bake Code is a specialty bakery, so seeing all the fusion pastries and buns is expected. Situated along Yonge, it's a given that their goods would be either Japanese and/or Korean infusioned. They offer kimchi, seaweed, fish roe as additional toppings to the traditional Chinese buns. Tasty, indeed, but not worth a whopping $6-$7 per.  I've visited once and that will most likely be my last."}
{"text":"Really enjoy bakecode breads, very flavourful especially the coffee and espresso ones! Loved the walnut pieces. Always consistent. I went during lunch time and they didn't have the earl grey flute in stock so I asked an attendant when it would be available and she was kind enough to grab a fresh one from the kitchen! The Chatime is a plus, and the drinks are always made well! I have already recommended my friends and coworkers to bakecode !"}
{"text":"They have great selection of pastries plus they have Chatime.  Only problem is if you drive, it's so hard to find parking in the area. But it's great for people who takes the subway.. walking distance from Sheppard subway station.
I have been here few times and their pastries never disappointed me..it's a lil pricey but it's worth trying!
I finally tried the matcha croissant and rare cheese tart and it's my fave so far. For sure I'll come back here again to try their other pastries"}
{"text":"3.5 stars in general.... we went during their grand opening, chaotic was the word... most of the samples were out, not replenish fast enough, waited and lined up at the back then told us the line for cash register changed to somewhere else!!! I was in the middle of the line, right in front of the cake display, then ended up at the end of the line?!?!  

I felt bad to put down my tray and left like other ppl did.... 

4 stars for desserts
we loved their desserts more than their breads :) not too sweet, perfect size for kids and after dinner. We tried Japanese cheesecake (light and fluffy), chiffon cupcake (with custard inside), milk pudding and tiramisu (replaced coffee soaked lady fingers with two thin layers of coffee cake).  We loved them all but will skip chiffon cupcake and try something else next time.  

3.5 stars for breads
As one mentioned, would like it better if they spelled out the ingredients, especially my son has allergies.  I didn't remember which bread, the goji bread or brown sugar walnut bread or sausage croissant or raisin coconut twist...we tried so many in a day, after he had the breads, he developed hives :S  

I personally didn't like the expresso bread, a bit too strong and had an after taste.  I drank a lot of water after this.  It tasted wonderful when I tried their sample!?!  

We like the softness of their breads, even my husband didn't like taro at all, finished few slices of their taro bread.  

Surprisingly, my nephews like the Gangnam Star, love their softness and the combination of cream cheese and kimchi; not too spicy, it was perfect for teens and someone who can't handle heat."}
{"text":"The breads look so good and delicious. However, I am so worried about the sanitation. There are no covers for the bread and small flies everywhere. Bathroom door is so close to the open bread area. And the cashier is so dull. I ordered TWO cheese tarts, after double confirming with them twice!! When I got home I still just got one. So stupid cashier and dirty place. Will never go again."}
{"text":"great selection of bread and taste. earl grey tea flute, croissant brulee... delicious!! i always come back to look for something new.  to my surprise, my in-laws loved the earl grey tea flute!"}
{"text":"So amazed at the quality of pastries!!!  Price is definitely on the expensive side, however, the quality more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to bake code at least 5 times now.  I feel like it is a chinese fusion bread place given all the chinese flavors.

I've tried a lot of them probably 10 different flavors and most are good.   The worst one is Longan fruit red wine.  Even if you like longan, not sure you would like it.  

The bread is fresh and if you stick with flavors like earl grey tea, mango, chocolate, cheeae, etc.  You can't go wrong.  My favorite is the cranberrry cheese one.  Yum.

I also tried one bubble tea.  Not bad but also nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Bake Code was far from where I was staying (DT Toronto) but I really wanted to make an effort to go here this vacation round. That being said, my fellow foodies and I made the 40 minute trek to the forgotten part of TO. A variety of treats/goods are placed on trays -- similar to what you experience when you go to a Hong Kong Chinese bakery -- and you wander around and pile your own empty tray with goods that you want to buy. I was able to try the salted egg yolk croissant, matcha croissant, charcoal Thai tea croissant, and charcoal green tea croissant. In terms of flavor my favorite ones were the Thai tea (amazing) and green tea croissant. The custard inside the GT croissant had a perfectly sweetened deep matcha flavor. The Thai tea tasted exactly like the drink in custard form (YUM). The croissants were a little dry but the custards inside were delicious. They recommend warning your croissants up before you try it but we were too eager to try the goodies to go home and do that!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times. First time i tried taro cream cheese bread (i forgot the exact name), second I tried their cheese tarts, and today i got matcha cream croissant. 

Taro bread was pretty good even though the price was high.  There was enough taro filling and cream cheese inside. Also the size of it was quite big so i cut them down to three pieces and ate it for three days lol.(4/5)

Cheese tart tastes good but i will not get this for next visit. First of all, it is the way too expensive. Secondly, nothing special except inside of the tart is rare...not enough cheese flavour.(3/5)

Matcha cream croissant was below expectations. Croissant part doesn't have enough match flavour and it just tastes like other normal croissant..nothing special. However, the amount of matcha cream is a lot and the cream contains some matcha flavour (but not strong enough for me.. I'm big fan of matcha). Additionally, the price is the way too high honestly.. $5.09 including tax (3/5)

Their breads are generally good, but i think the prices are too high."}
{"text":"Liked it. The breads are sooooo soft! If ur into that, u gotta try this place. 

It's like a twist of French meets Asian bakery. The breads were larger than expected from the pics on their website. Liked the samples, it helped narrow the choices down. 

Would liked it better if they spelled out the ingredients, especially the ones where ppl may have common allergies, like cheese. Ended up taking home a chocolate bread not realizing it had cream cheese in it. Boo."}
{"text":"The reviews are right. The shelves are practically empty if you don't come early enough. I walked in around 5PM and there was only a few pieces of bread left but it seems like the cake display is constantly being refilled.

I bought what I thought was the last two pieces of Mille Crepe Cake ($6.90 each, $65 for a full 8\" cake), but the staff said he can bring out more if I wanted a few more pieces. 

I think it's great that Bake Code sells Chatime drinks - it's a great place to just hang out with friends and have a piece of cake! 

The Mille crepe cake was good, but the crepe had stiffened so I wasn't sure if it was fresh. To say the least, I've had better elsewhere. The twice baked cheese tart was amazing and I ordered that out of impulse (no regrets!)

Tip: Save on taxes when you buy 6 items or more!"}
{"text":"The bread here is good but a little overpriced. I find the pastries lacking in quality and taste - although they do try to be innovative."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries and inventive filled sweet rolls are tempting when I stop in this cozy place for coffee. You can sample bite sized morsels of the different buns. I like the both the drip and expresso coffees. There's always seating available. Convenient location near Solar Stage children's theatre we often attend. Prices are high but reflect the handmade quality of the baked items."}
{"text":"It was such a huge disappointing.

A week ago, I bookmarted this place on yelp app.

I was happy and excited to found place that can make japanese style matcha crepe cake.

Matcha mille crepe was so dry and hard texture. I thought it would be very soft and fluffy but it was not. Not very tasty.

The Mille crepe was soft and fluffier than Matcha one.. but not wow taste.

Btw, Matcha crepe and mille crepe ...there was no big differences btw that. It was not flavorful enough.

Also I order tiramishu which I only enjoyed so much but also not the one of best.

And I order glazed sugar bread as well. 
I didnt try that one so I can not tell the taste but staff put that bread in a small plastic bag without tie.
Later I found the sugar icing was everywhere on my cake boxes.

Also they didnt even ask me if I am gonna eat in or take out.  They just put all them in the bag all together.

And they forgot to make my americano order which I wanted to enjoy with my cake so was another annoying.

For the last, the taro milk tea...

It was such a horrible taste!
Totally different taste with anyother chatime milk tea places.
Not thick and tasty.

It was so pricey than their quality of product.
Matcha crepe was 7.90 before tax mille crepe was 6.90.
Totally not worth it.

It was such a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Headed in on a not so busy time of day. Bun samples were plenty and everything tasted great! Great ideas for flavours too. I would definitely come back!!

A couple of things that knocked off a star...
For the prices of the buns, the place should be very clean. However today I saw a couple of fruit flies hovering over the back of the bakery. None of the bread was covered. This is OK in a cheap Asian bakery, but NOT OK at a place that charges $5 for bread.

Person who made my chatime tea didn't bother to wipe off the plastic cup with a towel before handing it to me, so I got handed a cup that had sugary bbt running down it. Wasnt a busy time, so no excuse, when you are charging Starbucks prices for your drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bakery
They have a huge variety and free sampling so you can try before buying.  Their pineapple cake is also good.
Too bad they don't have their free tea red bean loaf bread in the store anymore.  That is their best loaf and will never get tired off.  Hope they'll bring them back soon."}
{"text":"This was the $5 \"strawberry\" cream puff?!?!  One-half of a strawberry, to prop up the lid.  That's a scam.  Not even a full one?  I could have gone to any French bakery in Toronto and they would at least give me a handful of fruit.  The fridge was broken, so I couldn't even see it before I bought it.  I will never EVER buy a pastry from here again.  The custard was not even fresh.  It had hard skin in it from being left out.   I would give zero stars if I could.  All hype, no substance."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Their breads are creative and delightful, using special ingredients such as lychee, taro, black tea and red bean. At any time, they have a selection of samples for your tasting. Perfect to try while sipping on a cup of chatime or coffee!"}
{"text":"Pinch me, I've entered pastry heaven.

I love croissants. I love matcha. I love custard filling. Lo and behold, Bake Code has a matcha croissant with a matcha custard filling. Talk about a no-brainer.

In addition to the Matcha croissant, we got a Matcha Tiramisu, a Thai Milk Tea croissant and an iced sea salt crema jasmine tea.

My favorite was definitely the croissants. Perfectly flaky on the outside and the custard filling was rich and creamy and full of flavor. I honestly can't wait to return to try their bajillion other pastries and baked goods.

While the prices are a little steep it's not too bad considering how unique the items are. Also, I definitely recommend using the Ritual app if you want to avoid waiting in line or waiting in general.

I shall be returning to Pastry Paradise very soon."}
{"text":"These are the Kim Kardashian of French/Asian-styled buns.  Yes, they can be pretty big, but also kind of indivisible from money.  Seriously, at $3-$5 per bun, that's practically the price of a cup of bubble tea.  Which I suppose makes Chatime the perfect pairing, seeing as it's created by the Chatime owners.  

Those smartypants also incorporated tea flavours into some of the breads.  My favourite pick goes to the Earl Grey Flute.  Speckled with flecks of Earl Grey in the soft stick of bread with a shiny, honey-brown surface is almost like a unicorn horn.  Sliced in half and filled with an Earl Grey creamed butter, it tastes nearly just as magical.  

The Gangnam Star, a cluster of 3 small dinner rolls each housing a filling of kimchi blended into cream cheese seems to be a popular pick.  I thought it was OK, but less flavourful than it sounds - it was mostly like eating a spoonful of cream cheese. 

The chocolate bun tastes like Nesquik powder to me, which could be a great thing if you heart the stuff. 

We also bought the custard bun, which took me a few minutes to remember.  I can't even remember how it tasted, so u suppose it isn't one I'd particularly recommend. 

Despite my partners protests against the high price points (\"OMG, buns are like, $2 max at other Chinese bun places!\"), I think Bake Code is worth giving a try.  There's even a little miniature booklet you can take at the front counter which shows filling ingredients with pictures of each bun available.  With 58 buns/breads and 13 cakes available, I'll have to come back a few times just to try them all..."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming in here trying out their samples of various Asian inspired bread and pastry. Though this time there seems to be no samples left which I was pretty upset about. this time I tried out their new cream filled croissant (Thai tea flavored) and their tofu cheesecake. Their croissant was surprisingly good as you bite into the orange yummy cream filling. The tofu cheesecake was a disappointment as it had no tofu taste and the texture of the cheesecake was rather stiff. I still have it 4 stars as normally the other samples of bread I tried were pretty amazing."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE BAKECODE!

Oh gosh - the Kimchi bun with cream cheese, the cranberry with cream cheese are just lovely. I always kid myself that I will only eat one section (it comes in three attached pieces) in one setting, but who am I kidding. I eat the whole darn thing! I also really love the custard bun - and coconut twist with raisin. If I wasn't so scared of carbs I would eat here every day.

This place is also conveniently located to where I live, so I guess it's more or a ritual than anything - my husband and I will walk to Whole Foods, but stop of here for fresh Kimchi cream cheese buns.

Haven't tried the cakes, but they look so wonderful. 

If you're lucky to grab a seat, it's also a nice place to catch up; they serve chatime drinks here, and I'm a really big fan of their matcha coffee. Great addition to the Yonge and Shep area!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday for dessert. They have nice looking patio in front of the store, which can be great on a summer night. The store also has chatime, with limited menu.

We originally came here for their cheese tart, but when we saw macarons we decide to get some of them as well. We got 6 macarons (earl grey, matcha, pistachio, milk tea, and salted caramel). The macarons were actually pretty good BUT I would recommend refrigerating them over night before eating them! This makes the texture of the shells more chewy and crunchy at the same time.

The cheese tart was ok in my opinion. You can ask them to microwave it for you if you're eating there."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for amazing pastries and bread in North York Centre. It's a cozy yet modern bakery with seating on the side. They also serve Chatime drinks as well. There are many favourites here but the all time favourite is the earl grey flute. Soft, fluffy, and the earl grey icing in the middle. Overall a must visit when you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the uniqueness of their baked goods here. They take what all Asians knows best and grew up on (hot dog bun for example) and puts a spin on it - basically an Asian-Euro fusion. 

I've been here multiple times and even ordered two full-size earl grey cake from them (yes, it's that amazing) on separate occasions and it still tasted amazeball despite spilling vodka all over it (oops).

I also really like their earl grey bread (that sweet cream filling) and their chocolate bread (chunks of chocolate chip inside). Although, I must agree they are on the pricier side so I do only splurge once in a while because I can only justify so much for spending that kind of money on bread.

They do have to work on their communication skills between each other though because we ordered two cakes a few days apart and one person didn't tell the other which caused a huge mix up and almost ruined the surprise blah blah blah.

Overall, pricey place for bread but once in a while, I do not spending that $4 on a piece as opposed to $1 in Chinese bakeries."}
{"text":"It wasn't so that good but it looked really pretty. I think the flavour is too muted for my liking and it's not worth the price. I love the ideas that they combine European techniques and Asian flavours. It's just that the execution is poor.

I tried the mille crepe. (2/5)"}
{"text":"I came by here REALLY excited since I really like the locations in LA.... ill try not to make this a comparison review but it is inevitable.

First of all, if you are new to bake code, the best thing about it is that you can sample ALL the breads and the samples here are GENEROUS. The bread is french artisan style with an Asian twist (tea, red bean, taro, kim chi, etc) so expect something new and different. My favorites are the earl grey tea bread and triple crown. They nicely list all ingredients in case you are allergic. That being said, this Bake Code isn't hygienic as LA locations.  Most of the bread is located near the front door which can get really windy. In LA, the samples are kept in sealed containers and you are provided toothpicks to sample everything vs here they are just cut up in an open basket and there is one tiny set of tongs. 

What sets this location apart is that there is a Chatime (with a reduced menu) located next to it which can attract customers since it is SOOO popular right now in TO. I just wish that the other Bake Code drinks (signature tea and sparkling teas) available in US would have been here too because those are a huge hit and not offered at Chatime.

Bubble tea and fresh bread, what can go wrong? Well there's barely any sitting space to enjoy a drink and bun. Parking is a pain too... but hey its Yonge and Sheppard.

Prices are REALLY steep compared to other Chinese bakeries in Markham/Richmond Hill at $3-4 per bun (they're pretty big though) vs $1-2 and for this reason alone my chinese mom refuses to come or purchase any buns (unless I pay of course)."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and the baked goods and pastries look so good on display but take a bite and everything tastes so bad I had to throw them out (all 6!) Everything takes so synthetic and there is no way that is real whip cream in their pastries. The black sesame cheesecake is just vile had to spit it out. The matcha cream puff is not even the right choux pastry texture. The caramalized sugar croissant was like some weird bastardized version of the classic, texture and taste was just so off and weird. Prices match top quality French patisseries but the cheap chemical-like ingredients are worse than the cheapest Chinatown bake shop."}
{"text":"I came here one day when our intended spot N9 was closed (a good decision was made). It is such a cute bakery with so many uniquely flavoured baked goods - from loaves of bread to croissants to mini cakes and even a Chatime and their own selection of drinks. We ordered an earl grey mousse cake which was probably the best-tasting cake I ever had. It had so much of the earl grey flavour, was so smooth and creamy, but did not taste overly sweet or filling. I do not recommend the black sesame cheesecake from here though (go to Nakamura)! I could hardly taste any sesame, the base was too cheesy, and the top layer was literally so oddly tough.The matcha tiramisu was very yummy though! Lots of matcha powder to mimic the original cocoa powder and had the creaminess and layers of an expected tiramisu! I also ordered a matcha tea with salted foam? and that was even better than Chatime. :) 

My mom loves croissants so I bought home a matcha creme croissant! I thought it was good because the creme was light and smooth but it was packed with matcha flavour. I will definitely buy the charcoal salted egg yolk croissant next time for her!!"}
{"text":"If you really want to have a desserts, you may check this place out.
Better then other grocery store.
Mohca taste good!!!"}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of breads and desserts. I like how they have samples of each bread that they have for sale. However, I found some inconsistencies with what they bake each day. I went on two different occasions and one day they had the sausage croissant for sale while the next day they did not have it and I was disappointed.  

The major letdown for me is the price. The items are way overpriced. I buy 6 different kind of buns and it already cost me around $20. On another time, I purchase 6 sausage rolls and it cost me around $10. Definitely, the items are overpriced in my opinion.

The reason why I still come here is solely because of Chatime. I like how they partnered up with Chatime but I wish that they have a separate counter area just to purchase drinks from Chatime."}
{"text":"I had the crepe, not too sweet which is perfect. A slice is too filling so best you share with a friend. I like how it melts in your mouth on the first bite...mmmm 

I find the slice a bit too expensive though so not sure if I'll be going back. Not worth the value means not worth the trip, but worth a first try!"}
{"text":"went in the morning, around 8:15,  not much selection, only a few options of breads available. I saw a cart of bread at the corner of the store, and one of the store guy was sorting out the bread. Then I slowly approaching the store guy and would like to ask him what kind of bread was ready. All of of a sudden, I was being stopped by another lady at the counter (whom I believe is the store manager) that I cannot walk into the kitchen. I was literally just standing in the middle of the store, right besides the shelves. And I told her that I just wanted to ask the guy what kind of bread was ready, and I had no intentions to walk into the kitchen. However, she seem not listening and kept saying the kitchen was hot and dangerous. Apparently, that was embarrassing enough!  And I found a bit offensive about the way that the she talked to people.  

Well, may be she is way too stressed out~ I would suggest her to relax and listen to her customers. Listening skills did play a huge part in customers services.

Product wise, I ordered the raisin and coconut bun, nicely baked indeed, but a bit overpriced. 

I do like the concept of the stores, and the varieties of breads that they offer."}
{"text":"This place is by the corner on a strip of restaurants/stores on Yonge St. Specifically, it's north of Sheppard (north of the Government Passport office). Parking wise might be a little tricky - there are street parking available and a few paid parking lots.

There are interior and patio seats available - so it's a nice date spot or catch-up spot with friends. Inside is bright, trendy with a wide selection of baked goods and drink menu.

I guess you can call this a sister store of Chatime - you can use vicinity points on their Chatime drinks only, and those drinks include your classic grass jelly roasted milk tea.

They do serve specialty cafe related drinks - and this is the one I tried. It is a Matcha Black Sesame Latte (served cold with less sugar). Nice presentation of the drink, as you can easily see the black sesame at the bottle and matcha at the top. The drink itself was ok, more on the bitter end and heavy on the black sesame. The combination didn't fit to what I thought it would be, but it was worth a try to taste my curiosity.

Their pastries are also worth a try. Although it is a little pricey (average around $5), but it has a lot of interesting fusion flavors such as Croissant (Matcha, Thai Milk Tea), Bread (Earl Grey, Lychee).The Earl Grey is definitely a popular one (and also my favourite). They have samples available for you to taste, which I thought was nice gesture.

If you are in the neighborhood or craving coffee/Chatime, this is a place to swing by and also grab a few tea snacks if you have the appetite."}
{"text":"I've been to Bake Code several times and often find myself wanting to go back again whenever I have the chance. Their baked goods are creative and so on point. I have to say I love pretty much everything there. Their buns, croissants, their cakes, all so good! My favourite is the Molten Salted Egg Croissant and the Matcha Crepe Cake. 

I might make it my goal to try everything, but like everyone else says, this place is pretty pricey. I'm just glad I don't live close to Bake Code. 

Also, like everyone says their service is pretty meh, but we don't go to Bake Code to get served, we go there to go broke with happy taste buds!"}
{"text":"In summary the stuff here is better than your standard Asian bakery, but at a price point that is about 50-100% higher. IMO some of the items are worth the premium but some are not. I still keep coming back though because they have some unique things. 

I've got a few different things here and have been happy with most (the exception being a mango bread which really was just overpriced bread with a few tiny pieces of dried mango and raisins). 

Like the bread texture... It's really soft. They also have lots of samples which helps because there is so much choice. 

Tips:
-they sell bags of the little chocolate buns at a good price... 5 for $5. Those things are awesome after 15s in the microwave
-Maitaiko baguettes are really good and different, but only served around 3-4pm. They just make a few a day
- They have some seating but each time I've been they have all been taken"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Came back again and realized you ask them to warm up everything for you, and you definitely should! Everything tastes better warmed and the croissant insides are nice and melty.

The pastries are fluffy and flakey--everything is delicious. Because of the express Chatime here, it makes it even better!

It's a nice place to sit and chill. The staff are super sweet and didn't question when I said the 8 pastries I ordered for myself were not take out. My friend and I had minor regrets eating so many pastries all in one sitting, after eating dinner, plus a bubble tea for me. Still coming back for more though!"}
{"text":"This is a cute and exciting place. They are a bakery with a lot of fresh goods, and also a coffee shop with reasonable drinks. I don't really recommend this place as a place to sit down to have coffee since there are limited seats, and also they are very cramped so not too much fun!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and was really impressed! The cafe had a dairy free milk alternative, which allowed me the option to purchase a tea/coffee latte. For me this is really exciting because the only coffee shop that I know will always be able to accommodate me is Starbucks. It's always nice to discover a new cafe that can accommodate my dietary restrictions. 

Two of my friends shared a dessert and they really enjoyed it. They said it was less rich than a typical cake and that made them able to indulge in it after our big dinner at another restaurant.

Allover, we had a really good experience at this cafe.   The only reason I didn't give them 5-stars is because the cafe is pretty small with limited seating and places to put your coats if it's full. 

Would I go back?
Yes, Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Looks like a typical Asian bakery but with many assorted goodies and goodies you can't find elsewhere! I particularly enjoy their taro bun. Their assorted cakes are great too! Pretty much everything. Their buns and other baked goodies are fresh and has the right softness, chewyness and moisture in the cakes. Every time I am in the area, I have to stop by and pick up some goodies for myself and my family or friends. The store is spacious too with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating area. Atmosphere is casual and relaxing with a decent noise level. Environment is clean and kept well tidied."}
{"text":"Great pastries, you'll find some unique ones here hehe. I always put the croissants in a mini oven and the filling inside gets all nice and gooey, it explodes when u bite into them. Just finished eating a croissant with activated charcoal and matcha filling inside. It was great Hehe, recommended for matcha lovers."}
{"text":"Expensive, but I'm a fan!

That's really the only draw back from their unique and delicious pastries; that they are expensive. I think if you order 6 items or more, the tax is waived. So that's what we did. We are huge matcha lovers, so we order all the variations they had with matcha green tea. I would recommend ordering perhaps just one or two matcha items out of the six.... they start to taste the same after a while....still good.. but no variety if you get all the matcha filled items. 

They have millie crepes, croissants (charcoal croissant with thai ice team filling: THE BEST ONE/MUST GET), tarts and breads, just to name a few. 

They also have bubble tea here, but we didn't order any and spent our time looking at their pastry selection.

TIP: Don't come here in the late evening, when most of the items are gone. Get there earlier in the day!"}
{"text":"Bake Codes have been popping up everywhere and I've got to admit it is pretty unique for a bakery. I'm personally not the biggest fan of baked goods, but these stores always smell so fantastic. With this location paired up with ChaTime, it makes for quite a busy location.

This location, however, is quite small and doesn't quite use the small space that they have wisely. The patio was quite nice but the interior was narrow. with a little buffet of breads near the front, they block off a good section of space that leads to the register to pay. It is almost impossible to walk around without bumping into someone or needing to say excuse me. 

The baked goods here are quite unique though. From bacon to matcha, they have all sorts of different breads and goods that could tickle your taste buds and change your thoughts on 'just bread'.

If you are ever in the mood for something different in the baked goods world, definitely check out Bake Code. They have some great choices that can even be paired with ChaTime drinks."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good, nothing to complain about that. But had a pretty bad first impression with their service. My girlfriend was waiting in line for 5 minutes and two of the baristas decided to play favourites by skipping her to serve their friend who just happened to walk in. Very unprofessional... and the fact that you need two people to make one drink... 

The only saving grace was that the cashier lady saw what happened and was kind enough to double up on her responsibilities. Aside from multi-tasking as cashier and making two drinks at the same time, she managed to finish ahead of the two guys making one drink....

It's okay to be friendly to someone you know, but it's quite discourteous as a business (not only to customers, but to coworkers too) to do what they did."}
{"text":"Another wannabe gourmet bakery that doesn't quite hit the mark. One star off the for ridiculous prices, one star off for the stale cake and one star off for the service and convenience. 

The food is good, the idea is great. But what exactly are we paying for? Was super excited at this new bakery in the neighborhood. It had nice decor and great location, although parking was meh. And I was sooooooo excited that they had Mille crepe cake cause I was dying for it and I didn't want to go downtown. 

Let's just say that everything looks great but they don't taste as good as they look. The crepe cake was awful. Was obviously sitting on the shelf for too long the tip of it was hard! And the crepe texture was mushy and the cream tasted like nothing. I felt like I was eating green mush and I love crepe cake. This place just didn't do it justice. I didn't finish my slice. And the worst part was it cost me 7.50!!! Needless to say I will not pay another 7.50 to give it another chance. 

Again the Danish raisin swirl looked a lot like the one that I had in Paris but it was far from it and it probably cost just as much. The pastry was hard and not flaky, there wasn't enough of it, it was hollow inside, the flavoring was lacking. At least it had lots of raisin. I guess that compensated for the fact there were no raisins in my coconut raisin braid!!! The ham pizza mini loaf was alright but for more than 8 bux I would expect a bit more ham. 

If you are looking for the general Chinese buns don't come here cause it's not worth the price hike! And for the same price you can find equivalent French pastries elsewhere that's definitely better. But I guess if you are looking for some fusion buns like kimchi or sushi buns then this is where it's at! Service was slow, \"boss\" lady had some attitude problem and don't order the crepe cake go to the place downtown if you can."}
{"text":"I went to grab lunch here, and instantly was overwhelmed with the great aroma as we walked into the bakery. The store is filled with free samples all over, and I was able to try almost all the different sorts of bread. My coworker and I got 4 cakes; the japanese cheese cake, new york cheese cake, mille crepes cake and the green tea mille crepes cake. We also tried the sea salt coffee. The cakes ranged from $5-$8, so they were a little pricey but it was definitely worth it. Everything was so delicious, and they had great customer service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The cake and bread are kinda pricy, but the crepe was not very good because it was not very soft and creamy. Their coffee was okay to try since it's chatime."}
{"text":"I checked out this bakery because I was in the area but I must disagree with all the hype.

The photos looked promising so I entered with high hopes but unfortunately, their bread reminded me of T&T bread but with higher prices. Overall, their bread was too dough-y for my liking and the jams and fillings tasted artificial. The samples swayed me away from buying the ones that came with one (ironic?). I bought the sweet taro loaf (didn't have a sample) and it had clumps of fake taro and cream cheese. It wasn't terrible, but just wasn't my cup of tea. 

Knowing that I can get better quality bread and desserts for the prices they are charging, I don't think I will be back. This may be biased because I am usually not the biggest fan of asian-style bakeries!"}
{"text":"So I came soley to try the half baked matcha cake and I have to say that it does not taste as impressive as it looks. I loveee chocolate molten lava cakes so I guess my expectations were set pretty high.  While  I understand that it's half baked, it really just tasted like raw dough in the center.  The matcha flavour is also not strong enough and it's overwhelmingly sweet.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to get this cake, but I will most likely come back to try their croissants and bread still."}
{"text":"I always liked Taiwanese bakeries when I travelled throughout Asia, so I decided to give this place a try. I went in around 1pm, the store was not too packed. I bought the tuna & cheese puff sandwich and the crispy ham croissant. Although there was a Chatime express (it has most of the popular items from Chatime), I decided to get a coffee. The tuna & cheese sandwich was mediocre as the \"puff\" part of the sandwich was chewy and cold. The crispy ham croissant looked and tasted really nice. It was crispy and the flavor was not too salty or buttery. However, my coffee had a layer of grounded coffee bits on the bottom of the cup. I would recommend the staff to check their filters. Although I may come and try out some of their other pastries, I would never get coffee from here again!"}
{"text":"Tried a few items including breads (they have samples), desserts and bubble tea (same as chatime, no extra comments).
Obviously their breads outperform desserts. 

Chiffon cupcake: filling is good, but could use more. Cake itself too firm to be called chiffon.... 
Chocolate Swiss roll: ganache filling is good, but cake itself sits too long.
Millecrepe: crepes too thick and filling not enough, a bit too sweet too... From the moisture level of the cake, it's been sitting there for quite a while.

I do really love their bread items, a lot of new concepts to embrace. But overall, given the price, I would definitely expect a lot more from them. 

Atmosphere: environment is good. Clean and bright, nice seating."}
{"text":"Sample. Like. Purchase.

Bake code commands your attention luring you with the fresh smell of baked goods as you pass by. As it invites you in, the symmetrically lined croissants and buns on the perimeters of this bakery are a visual delight. They look fresh and the variety covers a good spectrum of sweet and savoury, with filling and without. 

The centre of attention, attached to the order / cash till, is a bright selection of pastries, macaroons, Swiss rolls and Japanese style cheese cake - sold by the slice and whole. The set up is contemporary with screens and a help yourself system to sample your items, select and load your own tray. With glass walls, it allows a lot of light when seated indoors and a nice patio area so you can enjoy a breakfast with your furry and human companions!

The food is fresh. I loved that you can sample and pick what you actually like. The cranberry bun and vegetables / mushrooms pastry were great comfort food especially when served warm. From the croissants, the charcoal, almond and custard filled were great. I was particularly intrigued and pleasantly surprised by the unexpected combination of wasabi and fish eggs croissant!

With a selection of hot beverages to complement their goods, Bake Code is a cozy spot to catch up with friends / time alone. It promises a warm experience every time - be it in the summer on their patio with a chilled ChaTime Bubble Tea or with the comforting smell of baked goods indoors, while sipping on a hot cuppa in the thick of snow!"}
{"text":"Loveeee it!
From the store concept to the service to the actual food that they serve, I had a great experience coming here!

Bake Code specializes in innovative flavours and exciting ingredient combinations for their baked goods. Knowing that you'd be curious of how everything tastes, they offer little samples in baskets next to each of their breads. Having tried a handful of them myself tonight, I must say that they're all unique and delicious! I especially enjoyed their early grey tea bread which was a baguette-shaped bread filled with a light creamy earl grey filling. 
Bake Code is also affiliated with ChaTime so they offer a considerable portion of their drink menu, including the classics like milk teas and fruit teas. 
I also tried their matcha mille crepe cake tonight and it was the best I've had yet from the many places that I've tried! Although I must say that the edges of the cake were a bit hardened and dried out (maybe because I went around 8pm), the layers were very dense and overall, the cake had a very pungent matcha flavour. This texture may well just be a personal preference but I enjoyed that the cake stayed together as we ate our way through it.  

Seating is a bit tight but definitely sufficient for a bakery. Staff were helpful and friendly, and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night to try this bakery for the first time and to get some bubble tea. It wasn't busy at all. I was pretty excited to try their desserts as I saw them on IG. When I first arrived I told the girl I wanted a couple things. I started off ordering a macaron and as I was going to order more... she walked away and put utensils away... so I asked if I could order more things and then she came back to help me.... poor customer service. In total, I ordered the black current macaron, matcha mille cake, matcha tiramisu, black sesame chiffon cake, matcha creme puff and a matcha croissant. I was looking most forward to the matcha croissant but as you can see it is not in the picture. When I got home I didn't realize she didn't give me my croissant! Pretty upset but it was my fault for not checking the bag before I left. 

Out of all of the desserts, the creme inside the creme puff was the best. The black sesame chiffon cake creme was pretty good too but not the sponge part. The cakes overall weren't tastey. Other then that, I would not buy these cakes again."}
{"text":"Not impressed... Bought some bread and ordered a hot four season latte today. The latte was not even warm - disgusting. I didnt even bother telling the girl who made it because i didnt want to wait again.. Disappointed because the reviews have been so good."}
{"text":"Yum!! I tried the croissant with fish egg and wasabi (can't remember what it was called). I didn't know what to expect, but I was actually very pleasantly surprised. The wasabi flavour was just right - evenly spread, and not too overwhelming. I asked for it to be heated up and it came out nice and crispy. Really unique pastry that I haven't seen anywhere else in Toronto yet. 

I also tried the black sesame tofu cheesecake which was also awesome. The black sesame taste was not too powerful or subtle. And I also liked that it was not overly sweet. However, I think I would have preferred if the graham cracker crust was a bit thicker or more substantial. 

I tried a bite of my friend's cheese tart. It was ok - not outstanding. Tasted kind of like egg tart."}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm as I was craving for something sweet.

Got 3 cheese tarts + 1 molten salted egg
croissant + 1 black sesame swiss roll + 1 hokkaido chiffon cupcake = $29.85.... PRICEY 

I prefer the Markham location better for so many reasons. The taste of the food remains the same but...

1. Parking is horrible here;
2. Selection of goods are limited, and
3. It's crowded.

I had to dance around people who were standing around waiting for their drinks to be prepared. It was really kind of annoying, but at least the girls behind the counter were helpful and pleasant. 
I'll probably stick with the Markham location in the future."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as the bread creations and branding looked so good. However, when I was in store, it was chaotic, and a lot of the baked goods I had hope to try were sold out. It was around 3:30pm on a weekday, which on a regular bakery, it's 'understandable', however this place opens till midnight, are people supposed to wait around for a fresh batch of baked good? 

The price is fairly expensive as well, with some bread ranking at 5-6 dollars. 

My favourite was mentaiko baguette, 'it tastes like sushi on bread' quote my S.O.

I'd still come back to try some of the items such as the desserts that were sold out and have another mentaiko baguette. The front patio provided some nice chill vibe that would be a good afternoon hang out place."}
{"text":"Awesome new bakery in the Yonge/Shep area which claims to blend together European baking with Asian flavours.  We may have gone a little too hard on our first visit - $46 total(!!), but at least I gave a lot of options a try for a more informative review. In short, awesome baked goodies but a little pricy compared to typical Asian bakeries due to ingredients and novelty of the selection.

The shop has limited seating space (about 4 tables of 2 to 3 people), but there are plenty of baked goods to compensate.  Almost every bread for sale has a sampler basket for you to assess whether it's worth your time - a lovely feature and probably why we ended up spending so much at a bakery lol.

Bake Code also has a limited Chatime menu given the same ownership team, but all the top favourites are there (roasted milk tea etc.).  There are also a few items I haven't seen before like Teapressos (basically straight tea...) and an iced sea salt coffee.  We shared a Green Tea Mille Crepe (delicious!) and took the following to go:

Matcha Azuki Red Bean bun - hint of matcha flavour but otherwise same as a regular red bean bun from the Asian bakery

Croissant Brulee - so sugary good!!

Taro Bread - I love taro milk tea and this is a definite get (flavouring is stronger than T&T)

Maple glazed croissant - typical butter croissant with a twist, well executed hint of flavour

Also tried a few more things through samplers, I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this Matcha Patisserie Crème Croissant.  I had been looking forward to eating this for months after seeing so many photos of the gooey matcha ooze out of the flakey croissant.  The matcha-infused pastry cream sure didn't disappoint and I even licked my plate after some of it had dripped out."}
{"text":"I think the pastries here are definitely more gimmicky than traditional, and for the price ($5+ per croissant) it's a bit much. 

I will say the salted egg filling is good and comparable to what you would find at dimsum but it's just strange eating it with a pastry filling around it / not warm (I guess you could always warm it up yourself?) 

I find the pastry to filling ratio is a bit much on the filling side so it gets too sweet/too heavy. The croissant itself is not flakey at all due to having so much filling in it so it's not light and fluffy as a croissant should be."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to visit the bakery today. After looking at tons of pictures from Instagram, I was really excited to try the breads and cakes! After stepping inside the bakery, I saw that there weren't a lot of variety so I think it's best if you go in the morning or even early afternoon. 

But I was able to get 4 items, I took advantage of the buy 3 get 1 free (ends September 23rd, free one will be the lowest price). I loved the chocolate bread..I think it was called smiley chocolate?? It had a chocolate and I think some sort of cream filling. I also really enjoyed the Earl grey bun!

 There weren't a lot of pastries left, so I couldn't try them but I will next time! I also ordered an ice sea salt green tea which was quite refreshing and a pearl milk tea. But they forgot to make the milk tea until I asked about it which is fine, I know they just opened and are trying to work out  everything."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after dinner at Moto Sushi. I remember seeing this new business on Instagram so I wantes to check it out. Since its their grand opening, they have wide variety of bread samples. Some were quite interesting with goji berries, mango and lychee flavours. It was pretty cool that you could see the bakers through the window at the back of the cafe so you know the bread is being made fresh. Another smart idea is that they also serve chatime drinks which is a bonus for people that live at Yonge and Sheppard. Overall, great atmosphere and friendly staff. The only thing that deterred me was the prices, some breads go as high as $5. I guess thats the price of gourmet bread."}
{"text":"I read about Bake Code in the Post this past weekend and had a chance to check it out today. The decor of the restaurant was nice and reminded me of bakeries in Japan. I picked up the kimchi cream cheese loaf, the pork floss bun and the earl grey cake. My favourite out of the 3 was the pork floss bun. The earl grey cake was nice as well however one of the layers of the cake was still a bit frozen when I ate it. The kimchi cream cheese was ok; it kind of reminded me of a bagel with sun dried tomato cream cheese. Overall I think Bake Code was good but it was a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I'm only going to give this place 3/5 because of their Chatime connection. The bubble tea is always good and the samples are a plus. The person that served looked really nervous and uptight missing some of my orders but thats fine seeing that they may have been new. The grand opening was really good, packed with business and everything was fresh and was expecting the same coming back again. I came in the afternoon and the pastries were stale and not fresh, not what I expected from  the last time I came."}
{"text":"Its a very cute bakery, definitely more upscale than your average Asian bakery. However for the high prices the taste isn't enough to justify the price. The interior was definitely very modern and clean. However I didn't like how the pastries weren't contained in a tray and risk contamination. I tried the cheese tart which everyone raved about and it was only okay at best. Tasted veryyy fatty and too rich. It did look really good though. I think I'd come back to try their cakes, the packaging definitely stands out."}
{"text":"Tips: don't pay for the parking before checking out if there's enough seat for you in the store, especially in raining weekends afternoon. :) 

Their matcha crepe cake is tasty, I also bought a matcha roll cake which also tastes fine. Their cream puff is a bit too sweet for me, so I didn't finish that one. 

They also have Chatime express in the store! Milk tea and pastry is the perfect match to me!"}
{"text":"IN LOVE with their selection! There's a whole variety of pastries, breads and pastries to try from. I love their Black Sesame Roll Cake. I find the price is higher because the quality of their selection is more unique than your average Asian bakery. 10/10 would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Hubby, wifey and Porkiebun love to frequent this bakery for their sweet pastries. 

The best items to try are - cheese tart, honey castella cake and the mille crepe. So delicious that the trio keep coming back to this place all the time to grab these treats. Definitely a must-try! A little pricey for these three items but definitely worth it. 

The trio have also tried their Swiss and their matcha roll, the New York cheesecake, the Tiramisu cream puffs and the matcha castella cake. Everything were ok but not praise-worthy. Their Hokkaido cupcake(?) was pretty good as well with the surprise filling inside.

Because it can get a little pricey, this trio prefers their top 3 items above. Side note, wifey loves everything matcha but there's something about the matcha pastries here that leaves a not-so-pleasant after taste.

Still worth the visit to try out the different items that they offer. They don't just have sweet pastries, they also offer savoury buns and a variety of baked produce.r"}
{"text":"I am a huuuge sucker for bread. And all things carbs, really. 

I'm in love with their Earl Grey Tea Flute! There is both a strong and distinct earl grey tea taste, and that combined with just the right amount of cream filling inside is just perfection. The bread was very soft and easy to tear apart, to eat in small pieces at a time.

Also tried their Matcha Patisserie Creme Croissant from their new molten series, and it was really good! The croissant was very crispy on the outside, but the cream inside was smooth and creamy. Although the green tea flavour wasn't extremely rich, I thought it was enough, considering there was already so much going on, with all the crispiness and creaminess.

Overall, the pastries I've tried weren't very sweet, so they're perfect to eat at any time of the day. Will definitely be back to try their other baked goods and drinks!

TIP: You could call them ahead of time to place an order! Let them know what time you'll be arriving and they can reserve the pastries for you, so they'll be fresh and warm when you pick them up! You also wouldn't have to worry about anything being sold out. :)"}
{"text":"Love the desserts here! Always made fresh! Definetly my go to place for baked goods once in a while cause it's quite pricey"}
{"text":"I came across this place on IG and let's just say, I'm happy I did. We got the salted egg yolk croissant, the taro croissant, the hazelnut chocolate croissant, the taro knot, the Earl grey tea flute and the twice baked cheese tart.

The croissants were absolutely a-ma-zing, on par with authentic French croissants: light, flaky, buttery. The taro one was my favorite, only because I have a thing for taro, and while it had no filling unlike the two other ones, it was absolutely delicious. The hazelnut chocolate one was oozing with Nutella (you might want to keep a napkin close by) and the egg yolk one had a very nice combination of flavors: lightly savory on the inside, slightly sweet on top and once again, oozing with filling (hope you have a second napkin).

The twice baked cheese tart had a nice buttery crust and the filling was so creamy and tasty. The Earl grey tea flute had such a delicate flavor. If you like Earl grey tea (my favorite kind of tea), I would definitely recommend it. It had a light filling of (I could be wrong) whipped sweet butter that added a nice hint of sweetness to the bread. The taro knot was really soft, almost like a brioche, with a sweet and creamy filling of cream cheese and? taro.

I live nowhere near the bakery but I will definitely be back, especially to try their other flavors of croissants and most likely some of their other pastries."}
{"text":"Fancy asian bakery. Tried the matcha creme croissant. The concept was interesting but tasted a little average, and was a bit pricey at $5. Better than supermarket croissants and comparable to those from coffee shops. Also had a hot taro milk tea with tapioca. It's really thick and filling, the consistency reminds me of soup... Also had their original swiss roll which came in a cute box (to-go). The cream is soft and sweet, and the cake was pretty moist. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I've now had the sesame roll and the cake part is hard like it dried out. I've had this one before at chatime locations and it was always fluffy and soft. Even when I ate it days later. I guess the one at bake code was old when I bought it and sitting out too long in the display. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Love everything in here especially their signature croissants.  My all time fave is the green tea creme filled croissant and the salted egg yolk croissant! Everything is always fresh it.  It's a bit pricey but the quality is great!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. I've been here a couple of times now and I love the decor and the customer service Bake code has to offer. Their large variety of interesting types of breads, their sweets and their drinks are just super appealing the eyes. I've tried a lot of their items and the 3 most recommended would have to be their taro croissant, their match cream croissant and their baked cheese tart . The match cream is super good! However, their matcha cream puffs are sometimes too soggy to my likings. They've also partnered up with Chatime so you can even get bbt with your bake goods. Bake Code also offer taking the tax off the 6th item which is nice. This is a great place to just chill and hangout with friends but not too appropriate for studying because the place is often crowded with people."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm gluten intolerant so this place is a mine field for me.  After two trips, both leaving with a full bag of baked goods, I'll just have to deal with the consequences. 

The cheese and ham loaf is fantastic.  Grilled cheese and ham sandwich with tuna salad and puff pastry on top, heaven in your mouth. Sailor's loaf with tuna, cream cheese, walnuts, I snacked on throughout the day. Gangnam star with cream cheese and kimchi was great. 
A tip, they all taste better if you throw them in the toaster oven for a bit before eating. 

I paid dearly on consecutive weeks after my allergies kicked in, not to mention some bloating and gassiness. So I will be a little more disciplined going forward.  But if I'm going to suffer, these are the sort of baked goods that make the agony worthwhile."}
{"text":"Pros:
1). Great location
2). Friendly staff

Cons:
1). Overprice 
2) I tried their tofu cheesecake and matcha roll.. Taste really average. I like the bakery store in j town so much more. They have fancy names for their cakes but they definitely did not live up to my expectation."}
{"text":"Yessssss. So much yes for bake code, I can't even. If you have not been here yet, YOU ARE NOT LIVING!! Bake code is the BEST higher-end asian bakery ever.

The baked goods they offer are so unique that I'm like 'wait what' everytime they release something cool. I remember being 'backstage' or in the kitchen for the release of the salted egg yolk croissant and I was mindblown. My pre-vegan self would've gorged on all of their treats, especially their peanut butter croissant. Slather me in PB and roll me in the direction of my room, because THAT's how I feel about peanut butter. 

They are pricey but they can be because:
1. Nobody else sells a similar bread - they're pretty much a monopoly in terms of asian/french bakery shenanigans 
2. Amazing quality ingredients 
3. Baked fresh daily - you can even see the chef making the bread.

Ps. the meintaiko (definitely spelled that wrong....) flying fish roe bread ..... try that and all your dreams will come true.

Also check out that lava cake that has been going viral on their instagram ... literally looks like lava I want to dip my tongue into. (I haven't tried it, but it looks bombdiggity. Let me know)! 

The place is also quiet most of the time, people usually pop in and out but nobody really sits down to chill. Good place to work from 'home' or study.

Bake code! Please inform me if anything vegan comes into play.. I literally will not leave your store."}
{"text":"Love the salted egg yolk croissant. Tried Thai milk tea, Earl grey and matcha cream as well but not as impressive as salted egg yolk croissant. That is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Limited seating and uncomfortable chairs on the outside of the tables. 

Really cool they have cha time but there's also no taro :(

I redeemed a free drink and they were confused about the rules of whether or not certain things were allowed. 

They had Mille crepe cakes but looked too uniform for me. 

Some of the baked goods reminds me of Chinese bakeries others reminds me of Korea but nothing called out. 

I'll be back to try their earl grey products if I'm in the area! 

5 ppl working a small counter is a bit extra. Boxes are super cute."}
{"text":"Cute little Taiwanese bakery/cafe (shares the same space as Chatime) tucked amongst numerous restaurants in the Sheppard/Yonge area. I've been meaning to try to the mille crêpes but still haven't a chance to do so yet! I really like how there are free samples of some of their baked breads - it's a nice welcoming gesture for customers (given that it is a relatively new cafe)! The oolong latte that I had was interesting - not very sweet but very frothy and creamy. Overall, Bake Code is definitely worth it to stop by for a quick treat or for bubble tea."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and it was packed, there was no table to sit at. So I just got it to go. I got the salted iced green tea, it was pretty good, the tea was refreshing and had a strong floral taste with salty creamy foam on top. It was new and interesting, it was about $4. They had small samples of the bread on top of the counters which was nice. Tried the chocolate bread, a raisin and some lychee roll, it all felt very bland and nothing really going on for the flavours they were supposed to be. They were all ok nothing spectacular, it all felt very cold and not as fresh as I wanted it to be. I wish they had a bit more baked good selection and less bread. Their prices are also higher than other bakeries. 

The staff however was very nice and answered a lot of my questions"}
{"text":"Very disappointing bakery. The savoury buns are greasy and still cold after you ask to heat them up. I have to note that they are also very expensive... You are better off going to a neighbourhood bakery for Asian buns. 
I think their sweet rolls are alright like the brown sugar loaf one, but still overpriced.
At least this location has a patio so that's a plus in the summer!"}
{"text":"Place is a bakery and they have place to seat for around 10-12 people at the most. Breads are very fresh and danish really good. Coffee no that good but decent. I noticed that most people come there and ask for \"Chatime\"special teas and mixes. So i think those are better than their coffee but i didn't try it myself"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3-4??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Chattime??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????4.5??????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had the pork floss pastry and tuna cheese puff sandwich. Both are very tasty and I recommend you try them. They can heat it up for you upon your request. 
The gangnam star is very good too. It has cream cheese, and kimchi (which adds a very pleasant crunch)."}
{"text":"The uniqueness of the bread here is just amazing! I love the Asian European mix. Their breads are made fresh and sell out fast! Don't come too late if you want to get some variety. They also have a cake display and bubble tea/coffee (Chatime). 

From their instagram it seems they are always coming out with new breads monthly which means that there's also something new to try! I recommend trying the kimchi bread!

As for dessert, I really enjoyed them - strawberry mouse cake and earl grey cheesecake (~$4). It's a nice little treat to try out these breads of your sick of typical Asian baked goods"}
{"text":"- Connected to Chatime (but doesn't have all of the flavours that Chatime in Scarborough has... i.e., honeydew)
- Not a lot of sitting room; the people who do sit down will camp out there for hours
- The bakery is just okay - quality of the baked goods is not that great

I probably won't be back here."}
{"text":"Came here last night. I like how there are samples for most of the bread so we can actually try the flavour prior to buying it (especially since its quite pricey). I am pleased with how good the mentaiko baguette and earl grey tea flute were. Loved it! However, the crepe cakes were a disappointment to me. The layers of the crepe cake were too thick and the bottom was just sponge cake. Definitely not worth the $7 price tag. I would recommend you to try the bread but skip the crepe cakes."}
{"text":"Love the place and service, fresh bread... I went for the opening they have samples so you can try. Cream cheese and Cranberry Crown, Rum and raising ring so far my favourites."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place, but overall good.

Breads that I love;
- earl grey cream bread
- cranberry, cream cheese bread
- cream cheese bread... I know I know, I like cream cheese
- tuna

Desserts I tried;
- mille crepe - it was disappointing as it may have been the last slice of the evening and it tasted dry and hard.

They could use more space for tables. They have an outdoor patio, but it is obviously out of commission during the winter."}
{"text":"When Bake Code first opened, I was excited to try it out. I've heard many good reviews about their soft, unique buns, and just as I heard, they were delicious! Very soft and doesn't get hard the next day that you leave overnight.

The price isn't low, but for this quality of artisan bread, I was willing to pay the premium. My favorite was the Rum Raisin ring and Taro Knot. 

However as I become a repeater, and as the grand opening craze died down, I started to notice disgusting things. All the breads are displayed in open shelves, and I've seen small flies stopping on the buns and crawling almost every time I went (and I've went about 10 times). It was nauseating, but I was hopeful and avoided the buns that the flies were landing on at that time and I still bought my favorite Rum Raisin and Taro Knot, hoping no flies ever touched those.

But, around the 10th time that I went in December, they might have been suffering from lack of customer and business. I went around 5PM, which is when I usually go, and bought a coconut twist and earl grey flute. To my shock and dismay, the buns were DRY AND HARD AS ROCKS!! I'm surprised because their buns are known to maintain moisture and softness for a few days... so how long have these rock hard buns been on their shelves for? The price I paid was the regular high price. $3.50 for a earl grey flute... which was rock hard. 

Disappointed with their stingy and dishonest way of doing business for selling probably expired rock hard bread. You lost me forever."}
{"text":"This bakery is quite pricey. One croissant is $5.50 with the egg yolk- almost the cost of the drink at chrome which it is joined with. 

The baked goods are definitely an arts and crafty baked item. I absolutely love their Earl grey butter cream bread log is so good!!!!!!!! Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"I heard about Bake Code and their popular croissants with matcha filling. 

I came here after eating dinner in this area and I bought a matcha croissant and a matcha crepe cake to go. 

The croissant was alright but it is overpriced for a croissant that was just an \"okay\". Nothing really wowed me with the croissant. I like the matcha flavor but I do not think their croissants is worth the high price. 

The crepe cake was even more disappointing. It was just SO dry. I've had crepe cakes elsewhere and it was creamy and tasty. I'm not sure if Bake Code is serving cakes made a few days ago or if they just can't make it well. 

I paid premium prices and I expected some decent baked goods. I was disappointed in the two items I got. Bake Code has a good concept and I do see potential but for now, I think they got to improve on their products."}
{"text":"This is a review more for how this bakery is ran than the food. I came here twice on the weekends and both times the checkout experience was slow. The first time we went they had problems with credit card. The second time the cashier was just occupied by trying to enter the items and pack the bread. To me a simple solution for better experience would be to have a person wearing gloves packing the bread and the cashier concentrate on entering the items and collecting payment. That way they would not crimp my bread with the tongs also. The line would flow faster and some customers will not walk away seeing the long line."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure if I came in the afternoon or earlier in the evening, this place would have been 5 stars. Although this bakery closes at midnight on a Sunday, when we got here at around 10pm, almost everything was gone and nothing was fresh. Now I don't know of many bakeries that still bake at 10pm, but I don't really understand the purpose of being open until midnight if you're just going to serve a smaller selection of Chatime drinks along with a small selection of leftovers.

So as you can see, I was thinking \"oh boy, can't believe I drove here for this,\" until I took a bite of their Black Forest Cake. I don't even like Black Forest Cake and it was delicious - so good to the point that I will have to make a return here at a more appropriate time to try their other items. The staff was also very friendly, and gave us steamed milk on the side for free. A big kudos to them.

I also bought their leftover cheese bread, and while the bread was a bit hard when I took it home, a light toast in the morning was all it needed to make it taste fresh again. If the leftover was this good, I can't wait to see what it would taste like fresh.

My only suggestion is that if the bakery decides to close late, then it would be helpful to replenish at least a few items so that customers who make the trip at odd times won't feel disappointed. I really wanted to try their signature crepe cake, but alas no luck. Nevertheless, I'm glad to finally find an Asian Bakery that would parallel the quality of 85°C Bakery, the famous Taiwanese bakery chain. I sincerely hope that they do well so they can open one in downtown Toronto, preferably right next to my condo."}
{"text":"I am going to throw out a bit of a disclaimer before all my Asian friends out there lose it a little on me for this review. There's traditional baking (French inclusive) with emphasis on using old world techniques to produce a rustic loath of goodness and then there's Asian baking; refine ingredients with emphasis on silkiness and creative flavour combinations. I am much more of a fan of the former despite growing up with the latter. There's something undeniably seductive about simple, rustic, buttery bread where it's the grains that are showcased with just enough transformation of the grains to bring out the best in aromatics and texture while not changing it too much.

This place was bustling despite our visit in an odd time in the afternoon. I really like the idea of having samples of almost everything they serve if only those samples were something to rave about. I liken the flavours; creative, interesting, alluring. That is about as far as it goes as piece after piece of chewy pieces of dough was quite a turn off (for me personally). The flavours are hit and miss, some overly pretentious (faux) and some just faux enough that the average person wouldn't be able to tell. However, the theme remains faux, faux in flavour and chew chew in texture. Not all is untrue though, there are elements of sincerity here like the raisins, chocolate and matcha powder for example.

We ordered some unmemorable cream cake of sort. I couldn't remember it because it was just that... not memorable. It was some special cream cake but wasn't quite special enough to be remembered. It was silky smooth and creamy but I can get that fix for a lot less than $7 or so. We just had to go for the matcha crepe cake now that it's so popular thanks for some place out in Kensington. It was a little chewier than I like it to be but still adequate. There wasn't a whole lot of matcha with the exception of the generous dusting on top. It was adequate to say the least.

There you have it. Mediocre bread with so-so cakes at some next level prices. If you are feeling fancy then enjoy! If you still want fancy but don't want to pay the price then T&T(supermarket) has essentially the same quality."}
{"text":"I passed by this place one Friday evening while trying to located a certain fried chicken place which I guess never really existed beside the Pizza Hut that is in that area. So being hungry and wanting to check out how different the chinese-style baked goods were at Bake Code, I back-tracked and went inside.

If anyone has ever seen this bread-making themed anime called \"Yakitate Ja-pan\" as soon as I went inside, that show immediately came to my mind. The baked goods here are what I can only describe as \"designer-style breads\". A lot of the items on display looked so different from the conventional looks of the bakeries along the Spadina Ave Chinatown. Especially the breads that were displayed on the front-most island shelf looked like half-sized takes on certain European breads with their own distinct looks. They were eye-openingly impressive at first glance, but there is a small downside to most of the products here, at least in my thoughts.

When I am really feeling hungry at 8pm and I see a chinese-style bakery and hope to get some of those meat-filled buns and rolls, then this might not be the place to get more stomach-satisfying fare. A lot of the products here even though tempting to purchase, were on the sweeter side of the flavor wheel than savory. I saw maybe just about four items that had more savory fillings inside like this Katsuobushi sprinkled bun (which was actually the stand-out item at Bake Code) and a tuna, pastry stacked grilled sandwich but everything else looked like they would be best to consumed for breakfast or mid-day snack.  And also some of those dainty looking mid-sized breads they definitely are not for like a single serve. Like for instance this raisin mixed, fluffy textured, baguette-style bun was big enough to be eaten on two mornings, it's not something small enough that I could just finish while walking towards the Sheppard and Yonge subway station.

I'll return here sometime during the day and give some of the other items a try. Like a I said before, they're mostly best eaten for breakfast or coffee time but the right items sure feel like they'd give the consumer a certain degree of comfort and satisfaction.
Oh and price-wise, given their \"designer\" look and size, there is a slightly higher price-tag on most of the products at Bake Code which for me I would get them for special occasions."}
{"text":"Bake Code has a clean and spacious interior. There's patio and indoor seating available. I came here for a grab-and-go but I plan on coming back for a tea break session. Since they have a collaboration with Chatime, this calls for a drink + baked goods session. :D

Highlights:
* Mentaiko Baguette (fish roe with Japanese mustard on a baguette - delish :D)
* Multi-Grain Lychee Roll (it doesn't look as appealing as the other buns but this was surprisingly one of my favs!)
* Smiley Chocolate
* Swiss Chocolate Boule"}
{"text":"The place looks nice.   Workers are efficient.  However, several breads and several cakes that I bought were less than I expected.  The sponge part of cakes baked unprofessionally.  It was not raised properly.   The whipping cream is loosen."}
{"text":"Innovative, premium, and inviting, Bake Code show cases new flavours that challenges the status quo. While preserving traditional flavours, this bakery marries modern Asian and European tastes, creating an exciting flare to anyone that loves bread and enjoys the delicacies of high end baked goods. 

Though pricer than the average bakery, the fluffy innovative textures and tastes makes every bite an experience and every selection a piece of art with your dollar.The tastes, although different and exciting, are gentle and airy as you would expect in any good hand crafted bakery. 

The fact that my girlfriend ubers 30 minutes to and from downtown just to purchase this bread, speaking volumes to just how good this place is if you can truly appreciate something new and a good bread or pastry. Give this Taiwanese renowned boutique bakery a chance, because many in Taiwan are definitely scrambling to get in line for it."}
{"text":"Bake Code is a small Taiwanese bakery that incorporates European baking techniques. The set-up is kinda cool, you can help yourself to croissants and other baked goods and then order the cakes at the front. 

I found the staff to be a bit rude, but I ordered a few croissants. The Matcha was way too intense for me. If you enjoy Matcha, you might like it. I also ordered the Hazelnut Croissant which is stuffed with Hazelnut Chocolate, that was okay. It was very sweet but not bad. My favorite was the Almond Croissant. Not too sweet, just the right amount of Almond Paste and Almonds. It was very flaky and enjoyable. 

Keep Eating,"}
{"text":"Good service bread was amazing . Though it would be better if they have butter and better stools to sit on. Having said that I would definitely go again ."}
{"text":"Amazing breads! Really reminds me of the nice and delicate pastries you can get in Asia. The only downside is that prices are pretty high."}
{"text":"The croissant brulee was amazing, I highly recommend that! We also tried the taro bread which was good and the taro to bread ratio was high. The cheese danish and custard bun were okay, the cheese danish wasn't very sweet where the custard bun was too sweet."}
{"text":"Pricey baked goods.  Small portion.  Patio was full around 8pm on a Wednesday night.  No lineups to pay for baked goods though.  Bought the pastry with the yellow filling for a snack.  It was good.

Staff was very attentive to put the products in a neat manner.  That's a plus."}
{"text":"This is a cool bakery with many unexpected combinations! Their most famous item is probably the filled croissants with flavors such as green tea, Nutella, and salted egg yolk (my favorite!). 
While the croissants might be a bit pricey at around $5, they also have delicious breads, also with super fun flavors like earl grey, kimchi, Goji berries. There are tasting baskets for most varieties so you can try it out before committing to an adventurous flavor. 
Definitely a great place to taste some novelty pastries! If you buy more than 6, they are tax free. :)"}
{"text":"Dropped into Bake Code for an Americano and a match crepe cake yesterday. I was pretty disappointed with the crepe cake. The original crepe cake concept is from New York from a place called Lady M. It's suppose to be light and the cream filling fluffy. That wasn't  the case at Bake Code, mainly because they pre-slice them instead of cutting a new slice when asked for. The slice sits for awhile which causes the crepe layers to dry out and a bit hard, the cream filling has great flavour but is rather flat. 
It took the Barista 10 mins to make one Americano.. Unfortunately I'm accustomed to Starbucks standards which is under 4 mins. They're very slow at making drinks here which is very unfortunate. 
Baked goods were pretty delicious and they have unique flavours for bread which were pretty tasty. This place is more of a grab-and-go type of place then a stay and have a coffee. In fact there's a second cup and Starbucks not far from here so if you're looking for faster service that's where to go."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night close to closing to get something sweet after dinner.  I wasn't really looking for \"bread\" so none of the buns really intrigued me.  The display case didn't have much selection left so I went with the Japanese cheesecake.  That is pretty much all I wanted.  It is a pretty hefty price at $3.90 for a small slice.  I got a slice at the Uncle Tetsu pop-up shop at the Front Street food market for $2.00.  That, I think is worth it.  Was the cheesecake at Bake code worth $4?  Hmmmm, probably not, but my friend paid lol.  The top part of the cheesecake was a little firm, but the inside was really soft and moist.  The packaging is a little annoying because the cake is so delicate it falls all over the place.  I ended up putting the cake in the clear plastic cover so the crumbs wouldn't fall.  The packing is cute but they should really put the slices in a box or something.  Something less messy.

I'm not really into bread but more into sweets.  If I came back I'd stick to their display case with all the cakes, but their prices are a little high."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Most of the breads are really good. I like that they have samples so I can try it before it buy it. 

My favourite bread is the Taro Star. It's a French type twist? bun? with sweet mashed taro inside. If you love taro, I highly recommend. I can't find this anywhere else so this is my go to place for sweet Asian-style bread. 

Another recent favourite is their Twice-baked Cheese Tart. It was sitting under a glass dome beside the cash area and I had to try it because it looked like a creme brulee tart. It tastes like a custard tart with a bit of salty topping (cheesy). It was not too heavy or oily/buttery. It wasn't too sweet or salty either. I'd say this the tart was really well made and I would buy it again, even at $5.50. I highly recommend this. 

Others I've tried:
Earl grey flute: Strong Earl Grey tea flavour which is good if you like Earl Grey tea... but I didn't like the buttercream inside. It was just too heavy and became kind of gross when when heat it up (oily) or cool it (hard). 

Gangnam Star: French-style bread with cream cheese + kimchi mix inside. It's pretty good. it's more of a savoury bread.

Crepe cake (original): Honestly kind of overrated. It tasted like they were premade and frozen when I bought mine - as in it tasted like hard crepe with icy ice cream in between. I don't think it's worth the price. Just to got a crepe store and get a crepe instead. 

Sailor?: I can't remember the name but it's Sailor something and has tuna and cream cheese mix inside. This was also pretty good. On par with Gangnam star. 

One star off for the high price (it's more of a treat, not a staple bread in my home) and 0.5 off for lack of seating. 

Also, if you want to get a customized drink, expect to wait a long time. I went for an Americano once it took 20 minutes for me to get my drink. I'm not exaggerating. 

Lastly, the store is connected with Chatime but doesn't take the Vicinity card for points for Bubble tea. Which sucks."}
{"text":"Very nice place and good quality breads. I felt like this is exactly the same as Korean bakery in Korea and a very Korean style. So i asked the staff and they said this is one of a franchise of Taiwan. The quality of breads are very good, place is clean and staffs are very friendly and welcoming. But this place was cash only. I will definitely comeback :)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming here this evening. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have grapefruit juice qq like they do at many Chattime's, but realize that this is a \"Chattime Express\". 

We had their matcha latte as well as a mille crepe cake to share. It was different as the crepe cake had custard instead of cream. Found this to make the cake a little more dense, and lose the lightness of a crepe cake that contains cream, If that makes sense... 

On another note they had a large variety of different baked goods from Earl Grey baked goods to Lychee. I also liked how they had samples, always a fan of try before you buy."}
{"text":"Went on a rainy week day, bought CRANBERRY FARLONA and CHEDDAR MINI LOAF. They are super soft and yummy. It remind me of \"Paris Baguette Bakery Café\" i used to visit in Beijing.?I like their coffee too."}
{"text":"This is an Asian inspired bakery with Chatime bubble tea connected to it. There aren't too many seats, around 12, so many people came just to buy some pastries or drinks to go. The breads and cakes looked amazing, and the flavours they offer are quite unique, like croissant with Thai milk tea cream, or honey lava castella. I tried a cake called XOXO (white chocolate and lychee)which was pretty tasty. I ordered a roasted milk tea with grass jelly which was good, like other Chatime branches. 

The reason why this place only got 3 stars is the way they handled their drinks. The staff wipes the cups after they're sealed using a stinky wet rag that probably hasn't been washed in who knows how long, and you can smell the disgusting musty smell as you go to sip your drink. So unhygienic!"}
{"text":"GET THE TARO KNOT!!! It's the best thing ever! I love all the unusual flavour that they creatively integrated into their baked goods. The place is clean, and there's also a Chatime in there (the Grapefruit Greentea is delicious). I love how they leave tasting samples around for you to try. There's some seating area and they also open late. I wish this was closer to my house so I can go more often."}
{"text":"- What I have tried:
  + Charcoal Salted Egg Yolk Croissant (5/5): very tasty, the egg yolk blended perfectly well with the croissant. I highly recommend to re-bake it before you eat because the croissants tend to be a bit soft and not crispy as they left it outside for long time in room temperatue 
  + Early Grey Mousse Cake (5/5): I'm not a fan of mousse cake but I do agree that the earl grey flavour was pretty stand out and that makes the mousse cake very unique. 
- Price: a bit pricey but I would say the desserts that I got from here so far worth the price 
- Portion: good for 2 ppl to share for a light dessert"}
{"text":"Ahhh bake code.

FREE SAMPLES
Can't walk by without stopping in for a round of samples. (Yes! they keep cute little baskets with cute little bread samples across the store. Workers generally do a pretty good job of pretending not to notice me casually stuffing my face.)

FRENCH/ASIAN FUSION
Bake code is a french - asian fusion bakery offerings everything from pineapple custard buns, sausage buns, to mochi-brown sugar bread loafs, matcha red bean rolls, parisian baguettes, crepe cake slices, cheese rounds, and oh of course...Cha Time.

VARIETY OF SELECTION
It's a self-serve bakery - you grab a tray and load up. There's a small seating area across the cashier. Overall, prices run high for baked goods ($3 to 7 each item), and fair for desserts. My favorite was the mochi-brown sugar bread loafs, and cranberry cheese crowns. 
I once had a salted egg lava croissant. Looked amazing, but was waaayy too sweet.
Baguettes are awesome, when they're available (30% of the time I'd say, depending on day of week, time of day, and the alignment of the stars). 

CASUAL HANGOUT/TAKEOUT TREATS
When I'm here, I'm either catching up with a friend over some Cha Time and dessert OR grabbing some baked goodies to go and enjoy at home. (and also free samples!) It's a lovely little venue, with outdoor seating in the warmer days. They have cute little lights strung about for the outdoor seating, and a large glass storefront with a lot of light for indoor seating.

Overall, great place to grab a snack over coffee/bubble tea or a treat to go."}
{"text":"The place is not bad but their dessert is always not available.  The bread does taste good but the price is rather expensive for the size of the buns.  They are having a buy 3 get 1 free promotion and I still think it's rather expensive.  I will try their dessert next time if they have any."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I don't usually eat bread but their sweet cheese filled breads are wonderful, especially the black tea one. Amazing and unique selections. Be sure to try their buttery maple croissant and crepe cakes. They also have these really cool cranberry and cheese filled bread like tarts and brioche (called danish crust there). Highly recommend this place.

ETA: Their double cheese tarts are the second best I have tried in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super unique flavours that makes me want to try EVERYTHING!

Always packed, funky, cute and warm interior with room to sit inside or out.

The teapressos are great! Happy to see a business like this in North York!

Bravo

Faves so far: Gangnam Star and Taro Loaf"}
{"text":"I'll start off with this: Bake Code has innovative, unique treats, but they come at a high price point. This spacious bakery has a nice selection of sweets, breads, and tea. It's located on Yonge and close to a subway, so it's quite accessible (not wheelchair accessible though). I tried the peanut butter croissant, salted egg yolk croissant, and tofu cheesecake. I highly recommend the croissants; they are deliciously flakey and have plenty of fillings. Absolutely delicious. However, I didn't enjoy the tofu cheesecake... It had the texture of a regular cheesecake, but had an interesting aftertaste (probably because of the tofu). Considering the price, I won't get the tofu cheesecake again, but I'll definitely be back for the croissants. Bake Code also has a seating area, and friendly staff. Overall: a great first impression."}
{"text":"Not bad for a weekend hangout coffee shop. They have creative receipes for variety of baking goods. Some look pretty impressive and incredibly fresh. A bit pricey but worth trying."}
{"text":"The main concern I have on the place is the cleaniness. I would prefer to have the baked goods to be covered. You see people get so close to the items, anything could easily drop on top; especially the area around where people wait to pick up their drink order.

Items ordered:

1. Matcha Croissant - cream filled - Not too sweet, very matcha-y, but a little too much cream. I liked it, fiance did not.

2. Cheese Danish - I liked it, fiance thought it was okay. Was nothing special though.

3. Cheese Tart - Fiance liked this most. I just returned from Asia, so I was disappointed. It was nowhere close to how good the cheese tarts are in Asia.

4. Hot Dog Bun - Nothing special, a little dry.

5. Mango Green Tea

Price is on the high end, sure, but you can appreciate how they try to be different in their variety and quality.

If you dont see cheese tarts displayed, just ask.
If you prefer baked goods heated, just ask.

Overall, not horrible, just not amazing."}
{"text":"I finally got to try non-chatime I thanks to the Ritual app. I tried the twice baked cheese ($5.50) and the Iced Sea Salt Crema Americano ($4.20) and both were delicious. The roasted coffee was perfection. It's probably the best Fancy iced coffee I've had in a while. The balance of sweetness was just right for me -it wasn't overly sweet with the help of the Sea salt. I did, however, asked for \"less sugar\" and it was the right choice. The cheese tart was maybe too good because it was overly rich. I think I should have shared it instead of eating the whole thing . 

Overall, I must say the quality of the items I've tried so far are A+."}
{"text":"This is so exciting. A new bakery moved into the space next door to my office. Not only do they bake fresh breads and buns on site, but they also serve Cha Time Bubble Tea in the same location. And to top it off, they also have fresh baguettes. And what's more, it's a Taiwanese chain and full of fancy buns that are not easily found not just in the hood but in the entire GTA! So I think this place has a LOT of potential for greatness. The space is awesome, the vibe is inviting and definitely feels like the kind of place I want in my hood. The only room for improvement is some of the bread are kind of dry. I would definitely suggest they work on that. For example matcha red bean was super dry. But some of the other bread such as the sweet taro bun was moist and lightly sweetened. I also loved the bacon twist bread. It went perfectly with my dinner and I can forsee me buying lots and lots of it in the future. 

Grand opening is on 9/17 but the place was packed when I went on the soft opening earlier in the week. It's currently cash only but hopefully they will setup the machines soon. Lots of samples to introduce you to all the flavours of breads, buns, cakes... Great selection, around 20 or so? Prices are reasonable for fancy bread with a range from $2-5 from what I saw. I still have a lot more to try but so far, LOVE!"}
{"text":"Bake code is under the same company as Chatime (hence why they're linked at this location). They sell a variety of desserts and bread with a layout similar to a Chinese bakery. There are pieces of bread available for sampling which is nice. You pick up a tray for your bread and croissants while the cakes and cheese tart are in the display by the counter. They also have a drink menu under Chatime. Prices are definitely higher here so it's not your typical bakery.

The desserts are a hit or miss from my experience. Things I recommend are the baked cheese tart and the earl grey croissant. Upon my first visit, I had tried out the matcha croissant and it was stale to my disappointment. The filling also tasted like whipped cream. The mille crêpe (just tasted like thin pancakes with whipped cream spread in each layer), early grey mousse (nothing special) and salted egg yolk croissant (way too heavy and oily) were also disappointing.  The baked cheese tart on the other hand is divine. Super soft with a crispy and buttery crust, so good. I had it again when I revisited and the quality was consistent. The earl grey croissant I had was also crispy and the filling was like a custard with specks of tea in it. Very fragrant and creamy, yum! 

There is limited seating inside but you can also sit outside as well. It is definitely worth trying. I would come here for a treat from time to time."}
{"text":"bake code at Yonge location is getting worse and worse . I used to be a big  fan of bake code and visit the store every week. I noticed that their bread is getting smaller and smaller but the price is still the same. . I'm like okay?so I picked the bread I want and cash out . The service is awful!!!   The work is playing with her phone when I standing there waiting for cash out!!"}
{"text":"I don't know whether I should be happy or not that finally a quality bakery opened at Yonge/Sheppard as I love pastries but I'm on a low-carb diet. Regardless, it just opened so I dropped by today to check it out. Each pastry had samples so customers could try, and all samples I tried were so good! Judging by what was available today, the prices were very reasonable - ranges from $1 to $5 (I guess they may add more stuff later though). I picked up taro pastry (I forget the exact name) and chocolate baguettes, and they were so amazinggg. They're generous with the taro filling and I THINK it also has cream cheese in it. The staff were very friendly and packed my pastries individually which I liked. 
Neat place - I recommend you visit as well when you crave some carby yumminessss!"}
{"text":"My go to bakery for now, it's has a bit of everything and continues to surprise me. The selection is deliciously made and really has a hint of east meets west. The staff is super friendly and the samples are continuously stocked for patrons to try their outstanding goodies. I just find it a bit pricey considering you want to take a whole bunch of heavenly breads with you home. It can ring up the tally pretty fast, so be aware that you might go home broke if you can't resist your urges. 

Not to mention, it is a good hangout spot to have a sip of their coffee and sit back and take in the scent of a fresh baked bread coming out of the oven."}
{"text":"Thank you Bake Code for providing me with breakie for the past month.  Going through the menu and listing my purchases makes me realize I need to stop eating so much carbs.

Cool concept okay eggsecution:
-Lychee multigrain:  maximum enjoyment peaks when you taste the lychee
-Earl grey flute:  pretty, but bread texture was meh and whipped cream not necessary
-Brown sugar walnut:  a bit medicinal tasting, brown sugar was a little funny
-Ham pizza mini loaf:  if only it wasn't oily, fairly delicious.  
-Mango tango:  a whole lotta mango, nothing special though.

Faves
-Azuki red bean mini:  I need to grow some azuki beans at home 'cause this was magic
-Chocolate baguette:  you don't need to be a fan of chocolate to like this, it's subtle
-Mixed bean cheese roll:  the combo of sweet and salty was fantastic
-Sweet taro:  confession - I just really like taro.

Cute that they partnered with Chatime and you can enjoy some nice drinks with your carb heaven.  My fave bakery in Toronto just cuz I haven't really gone to any other bakery more than once"}
{"text":"Overall their baked goods tasted stale. We had a Green Tea Millie Crepe Cake here that didn't feel layered. Matcha Cream Croissant that wasn't flaky. IMO it's better to go to a traditional Chinese bakery for what they do best or Millie Creperie if you're looking for crepe cakes."}
{"text":"Their croissants are indeed very tasty. I tried most of them in one-go lol (coffee/charcoal/green tea/ charcoal-green tea/ a red one/ almond/earl grey) and the earl grey flute and a piece of white chocolate crepe cake.
But most of the croissants are just gimmicky... custard/fillings and weird colors. They are just a one-time thing for me."}
{"text":"There's pricey, and then there's overpriced. This is overpriced. Presentation is great. So great that, after you eat their food, you think, \"oh i guess they spend their money on packaging then...\"

The pastry is not good. Visually it does look fantastic. But the taste isn't average level. I ordered matcha creme croissant and twice baked cheese tart. Completely forgettable. They're priced at about $4.5 to $5.50, but should really be selling for $2.50 at most. 

Reminds me of Fugo downtown, the ice cream joint with very instagrammable concoctions but sun-standard ice cream. This is like walking into a Starbucks and being served PC brand coffee. 

2 stars out of 5.

{"text":"Decided to try this cute little taiwanese corner shop located near Yonge and Sheppard. I love this bakery because of the variety of breads, pastries, cakes, and tarts that they have to offer. There is a seating area as well with some small tables and chairs where you can eat in. I decided to try the Earl Grey tea flute bread and Cranberry Walnut bread. I must say that the Earl Grey tea flute bread was pretty amazing. Before trying it I actually had low expectations that there would be any tea flavour. My first impression of the bread was that it looks like a long sausage. I pressed the bread with my tongs and the outside of it actually felt quite hard so I was not sure if it was fresh. But I decided to give it a shot.

One bite into the Earl Grey tea flute bread and I was pretty impressed and it was not what I had imagined. The Early Grey tea flavour was quite distinct and the bread was quite soft, fresh, and stretchy. Inside the bread there is some kind of butter cream filling which was very nice as well and not too sweet.

As for the Cranberry Walnut bread that was quite tasty and fresh too. In terms of of portions it is a pretty big piece of bread and is good for sharing. But I would say that it is more ordinary in terms of flavour.

In comparing the two that I tried though I would say that the Earl Grey is more unique and will definitely go back for seconds and try out some other breads.

Decided to come back a second time to try more of their goods. Unfortunately this time the Earl Grey tea flute had sold out by 8pm so decided to try the Millie Crepe and absolutely loved it. The crepes are soft and sort of melts on your mouth. I also like the somewhat cold feeling from the creme when you bite into it before it melts in your mouth lol

The creme latte here is very good as well with pretty latte art that does not go away until you get down to the very bottom of the cup.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I got the croissant with the Thai iced tea filling. The filling was tasty but found it poorly distributed. Most of it was in the centre and very little at the ends. Normally this wouldn't be a big problem but the croissant itself was glazed making it annoyingly sticky and hard. I prefer my croissants soft and easily torn apart. So for $7-8 each, it was pretty but not worth the hype. Not at that price anyways!"}
{"text":"Great bakery! As soon as you enter you can smell all the bread and pastries being baked in the kitchen. They have a very good selection of savory and sweet baked goods. 

My favorite one is the Early Grey Stick. Slightly sweet, a little creamy. Goes amazingly well with a coffee or tea. 

Another great feature of this bakery is that you can taste all their selection! This way you know exactly what to get. 

The price range is slightly higher than average but is perfectly worth for the quality of their products. 

You can also get Bubble Tea from ChaTime, although it's a restricted menu."}
{"text":"Bake Code is the hottest new bakery which recently opened up at Yonge and Sheppard. Combining Asian and European techniques makes it a truly unique experience.

Pros:
Very unique items for sale
Partnership with Chatime

Cons:
Prices are a bit higher than usual Chinese bakeries

I've come here a couple of times since it opened and it's always full each time.  As I said before, they combine techniques from Asian and European bakeries to create some pretty unique items.  There are some items you may recognize from the usual Asian and Euro bakeries, but they definitely have more items that are their own unique creations.

They have an extensive menu but not everything is available at any given time.  They are constantly baking throughout and items will come out on a schedule. This can be a little frustrating if you're coming in looking for a certain item  though. My GF has shown up multiple times looking for the earl gray tea flute but has not been able to procure one yet.  My little one loves this place as they have tons of free samples to try.  

As if you needed any other reason to come there's also a Chatime here!  I do have to put the disclaimer here that it's not Chatime employees making you're drink though.  It's the bakery employees that make the drink.  I believe the girl making my drink was making one for the very first time. It wasn't horrible but it did feel like something was lacking.  If you're a Chatime junkie like me, it might bother you but if you don't go often you won't notice at all.

The prices here are a tad on the expensive side.  The regular items you can find elsewhere are anywhere from 50 cents to 2 dollars more pricey.  The unique items they offer can you set you back anywhere from $5 to $10.  Some of the items are worth the mark up.  It's up to you to decide whether you feel it's worth it or not.

All in all, I do like Bake Code a lot.  They are missing my egg tarts though.  Should they get those in the menu I will immediately give this place 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I came here specifically to try the matcha creme croissant but I was surprised to see they had so many different croissant variations with all type of fillings. This place is definitely CROISSANT HEAVEN. I didn't know there were so many different types before I came here but because I was limited on Canadian money, I just got the matcha creme croissant that I came here for. Keep in mind there's a regular matcha croissant without the filling and there's also the matcha creme croissant that comes with the filling that you need to order at the register. In addition to different pastries, they also serve Chatime tea varieties. 

The matcha creme croissant was super delicious! The croissant was flaky and fresh and the cream inside wasn't too sweet and overpowering. I'm not a big fan of cream-filled pastries but the matcha cream was definitely better than I expected it to be. The croissant is powdered with matcha which can make eating this quite messy if you're not careful. I'm sure there other croissant varieties are just as good! I wished I could've tried more but I definitely give this place props for their creative pastries."}
{"text":"My mother in law was recalling some of her fav (eating) moments while visiting my husband and me over the years. She isn't the biggest sweet eater but couldn't get over the green tea Millie crepe cake from Lady M. After learning that Bakecode offers its own version of Millie crepe cake, we sped our car over. 

Honestly, I felt like a kid being dropped off at a candy store - I was surrounded by freshly baked bread SAMPLES. While my husband was busy getting the crepe cake boxed, I was running around corner to corner sampling my heart out (no shame). We did buy a few additional baked goods, which were surprisingly/not surprisingly? not offered as samples - earl grey flute, green tea, Nutella croissant, and tiramisu cream puff. 

We soon hurried to the seating area and began devouring all sweets. After a couple of bites each, we concluded all items were just okay. Mille crepe cake - the crepe layers were too thick. Instead of melt in your mouth delish, Bakecode's was cakey and dry. In fact, the edges were hard and stale - Not sure how long our slice had been sitting. 

Tiramisu cream puff - mouthful of cream and lacked any contrasting texture. Flute - the bread was very chewy and tough to begin with. Stored in room temperature overnight made it even worse - became brick hard and inedible. The two croissants were fine but lacked the flakiness and buttery flavor one would expect from a regular croissant.

Overall - we just have to keep our fingers crossed that Lady M would make its way to Toronto one day."}
{"text":"The jury's out on this place for me!  I was stuffed from lunch, but if I liked any of the samples, I would've definitely bought something to enjoy at home.

Good:  Samples for a handful of their items.  New location, so it's clean updated.  Staff seemed friendly as they were serving people who were ordering.

Not-So-Great:  Samples were UGH.  Everything looked good, but bread had this weird spongy, fakey quality to it as opposed to SOFT.  Again, although everything looked good, I was thrown off by the texture.  Not for me.

I love the occasional trip to French, Chinese, Taiwanese, whatever ethnicity the bakery nearby happens to be, but I've had better tasting bread in cheaper, local HK-style places.  If you're gonna be fancy, have the product to back it up!"}
{"text":"Bake Code is a typical bakery that tries to give customers the impression of a dessert place. Imagine if a Chinese bakery colabs with a European dessert house, that's Bake Code in a nutshell.

You walk in and bam, colours, scents, and a ton of selection. Make sure to be selective because these goodies do cost quite a bit if you compare them to a traditional Asian bakery. 

They transform your regular Asian bakery goods into something less \"generic\". Take a regular croissant - Bake Code will use matcha dough, and fill it up with concentrated matcha filling, and finish it with a sprinkle of matcha powder. 

The pastries here are very sweet; there were certain pastries I tried that I considered to be a bit too sweet. 

It was a fun experience to come here and pick out couple goodies to try. The flavours and the thought/idea of the pastries here are great, only if the sweetness was not overpowering everything I wanted to taste. However, the whole concept of transforming traditional baked goods was a bit gimmicky. and by paying 3,4 times the price, I would rather stick with a traditional Chinese bakery or European dessert house."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best bakery in the Yonge Sheppard area.  I'm so thrilled to have this in the area.  Finally a great place to get EXCELLENT quality baked goods as well as super service.  It just opened up and I was lucky enough to get to try their goods.  I love that they have samples of the bread.  I will definitely be buying many of the goods there as everything that I tried was amazing.  I also really love the workers there.  They are very helpful without being pushy.  SO thrilled to have this new amazing bakery!  I also found the prices to be extremely reasonable for the quality of the goods."}
{"text":"This place is super busy inside, but may be because they're severely understaffed. There was a constant flow of 20 customers inside the store at any given time and 3 people working. This made the line go by very slow and was very inefficient. 

That being said, I had their croissants and they were pretty good. Cost about $4 for a croissant, which is not excessive, but for me, it was not worth it. I suppose if they were fresh out of the oven and the filling (molten egg in my case) was warm it'd be worth it. But after having it, I'd prefer the original french-style croissant without the filling."}
{"text":"Most incredible breads and pastries. 

My favourite are the croissants: matcha pastry cream, salted egg yolk, peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut! So delicious every single one of them. 

My only suggestion is if you're not eating it the same day, crisp it up in the oven at 425 for about 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Gangam Star, Double Cheese Loaf, Lychee & Goji Berries loaf covered in seeds were delicious.

Scored the buy 3 get 1 free deal :)"}
{"text":"Great casual cafe with a good although limited selection of baked goods and a more generous number of beverages. The baked wares were good for a quick bite on-the-go. Service was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I tried the original crepe cake, green tea croissant and taro croissant. They are all good. I personally prefer less sweetness, so greentea croissant is the best. Crepe cake is as good as Millie Creperie's."}
{"text":"The place is very fancy, not like other Chinese bakery, the price is higher but the food is way better
They also have chatime in the store
There are plenty of tables for ppl who want to sit there and enjoy their tasty bakery
Their pizza bread is so flavory, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the rare cheese tart! A little bit hard to find this place, it's kind tiny store."}
{"text":"Tried their Matcha green tea croissant,  Salty egg cream croissant and Cheese tart. Guys like the green tea croissant better as it is not as sweet as the other two. I personally love the Salty Egg cream croissant and the cheese tart. the croissant taste better after microwave for 20 to 25 seconds cuz the juice inside will melt and accentuate the  taste and texture."}
{"text":"Love their earlgrey flute. I just hope that it dpesnt get dry so fast. If I want to have it for breakfast, it starts getting hard. They have amazing molten croissants! Bit pricy at around 5.50-6.00 each, but have amazing flavours. Again. I.Love.Earlgrey. lol my sister likes their pork buns. Not a huge fan of their green tea/matcha pastries tho..."}
{"text":"I have to come back here a few more times just to be sure, but my first impression is good so far!

There is a lot of yummy-looking pastries and cake here, and it will take me quite a few visits to try them all. I was quite drawn to the matcha honey castella lava cake that comes out fresh everyday at 4pm, but it is quite a big one at $11 each, so I will save that to bring to a party in the future.

Got a peppermint steeped tea and a twice baked cheese tart - came to about $9 total after tax - not cheap but not too pricey considering how much they charge for desserts at restaurants. The cheese tart was very delicious - it has the taste of japanese cheesecake, but at a much more intense flavor! Yum!

Areas they can improve on: I think they could use some more and better seating. They currently have only 8 tables, which I think would not do them any favors in the winter when outdoor seating is not feasible. Half the table is using cheap grey plastic chairs with no backing, definitely can improve on that. Also, the shelfs at the back are all empty - that could easily be used as additional seating area.

I am definitely game into coming back here. There have been very mixed reviews on the millie crepe cakes - I will have to come back to try them....and also the cream puffs, and tiramisu cakes..lol"}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for the buns that are basically asian buns. They're good but I wouldnt pay $4 for one bun again.

Mango tango $4.20 it was kinda boring, I like the mango bits but overall not the best

Custard bread $2.20 real custard which was nice

Croissant brulee $3.50 meh, its just a slight glaze on top 

Denmark crust $2.50 interesting texture and wasnt that bad, its airy inside. 

Overall decent but not for the price. Affiliated with chatime."}
{"text":"The pastries here are a bit pricey compared to other asian bakeries. But the flavour combinations are different & I really liked that. I haven't seen a lychee multi-grain bread anywhere else! The brown sugar bagel & coffee/mocha bun was really delicious too. I even liked the mini-Taro loaf. Anyway I also liked that they have samples of almost everything there. So if you're not sure whether or not you'll like a matcha croissant just try the sample. Some people are shameless in their sampling but well that's the risk you take at a place like this. 

There's also a small eating area for those who want to snack & then dash. Besides the pastries they also had desserts in a glass display by the cash. This place gets busy. When we came in the line looked long. But by the time we got to the cash everyone was served so we didn't have to wait long. I wouldn't buy these pastries every day but for a treat now & then this is the place to go for your pastry fix. Next time I'll try some different flavours & hopefully some cake. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"if it wasn't for chattime, i would not have known about this place. there are so many asian inspired croissants and other bakery treats! i ended up getting the matcha croissant and the charcoal thai iced tea custard croissant.

hands down the best croissants in toronto!! i loved the flavour of the charcoal thai iced tea custard croissant. it was really different from the typical flavours such as cheese, chocolate, almond, etc. someone definitely thought outside of the flavour box! they managed to capture thai iced tea flavour perfectly and injecting them as custard. the charcoal croissant was crispy and the orange stripes really made it standout. i thoroughly enjoyed every bite of this croissant and would totally take a 1.5h transit just to have it again

the matcha croissant was a big let down - even though it was appealing, the taste didn't do it for me. i thought the matcha flavour was really strong thus tasted bitter because of the additional matcha powder that was sprinkled on top. i think if this was taken out it would be perfect. the croissant was soft and had matcha filling"}
{"text":"Ordered their traditional Japanese Lava honey and matcha cake. They're supposed to be half-baked castella cake. However, they all became well-done. Just tasted like the one you could buy from supermarkets. What a disappointment and waste of money!"}
{"text":"Bake code was a small unique bakery sweet experience. I stumbled upon this place with a girlfriend of mine and had to order the double baked cheese tarts, green tea cream puff & Mille cake. Reminder: come here with an empty stomach if you want to try everything! You can only eat with your eyes so much before you end up buying everything you see! Out of the 3 I ordered the double baked cheese tarts and the green team cream puff were amazing. I am definitely going back to try more!"}
{"text":"The bbt from Chattime is overly sweet, even if you as for half sweet. Their regular drip coffee is not strong enough and taste watery. Their buns are too pricy for what they are."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for baked goods and bubble tea. I must say that the interior is clean and fairly spacious, and seeing the large variety of breads made me feel very happy. I mainly zeroed in on the desserts though, because I have an insatiable sweet tooth; I bused at least half an hour to get here! 
I got the matcha red bean bread, the Hokkaido chiffon cupcake, strawberry shortcake, earl grey mousse cake, and the black sesame cake. All were good, but the match red bean bread, Hokkaido chiffon and the earl grey mousse were exceptional! 
The bread was the perfect amount of sweetness and matcha, and was comparable in pricing with Asian breads in other bakeries, so it's worth your buck. 
The Hokkaido chiffon cupcake was fluffy and had a sweet and light cream in the center. The earl grey mousse cake was rich and smooth, consisting of a sponge and soft mousse layer. 
The only critique I have is that the sponge in black sesame cake was slightly dry. Not a huge deal, because everything else was good. 
These desserts cater very well to my family's tastebuds, so if you want to bring something nice for an Asian family function, bring desserts from here!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice high end Taiwanese bakery, serves loaves, bread, cakes, and Chatime too. They have a wide variety of different bread flavors such as mango flavor, with mango bits mixed in the bun. They have free samples for each of their breads which is good so you can taste it making sure you like it before buying since each bread piece is quite big. I really liked the cheese ring, its stuffed cream cheese with mixed garlic and herbs. The bacon twist has a few big pieces of bacon in it. The cheese triangle had a lot of cheese, was nice and crispy. The chocolate bean buns was soft and tender, with chocolate chunks inside. Overall all their breads tasted good!"}
{"text":"Not as many options as I expected and no cheese tart. Almost all tasters were gone and not enough seating inside for us to sit."}
{"text":"Took a walk here from Nome after dinner and this bakery has some crazy breads. That earl grey bread with cream in the middle...is aroma heaven. They also have all kinds of crazy stuff like kimchi in a traditional chinese bun. Best part is that they have llttle baskets for your to sample before you buy. I would definitely recommend you go crazy on the fresh buns, but the dessert bar i'm not too sure about. We tried the $7 matcha millefeuille/millecrepe and was definitely not worth the money.

Seating can definitely be improved as there was no where to sit to enjoy their pastries."}
{"text":"Sorry bake code :( have to give 3 stars only BC i waited over 20 min to get my BB tea, store wasn't even that busy. And the matcha croissant? Wtf is that, I didn't even taste matcha ! Just call it a GREEN croissant, will visit again soon, maybe review will change , let's hope for the better. 
Also everything/ all baked goods is to exposed ,  people cough, sneeze , etc... not hygienic @ all."}
{"text":"Lots of interesting flavours of Asian foods combined with simple pastries bringing it to the next level.  I had tried various ones including the Salted Egg Croissant which was very interesting.  I enjoyed it but the price point it sits at was too pricy to purchase again.  

The staff were very friendly and the place was clean and very enticing.  Displayed nicely and samples available.  If you purchase 6 items there is no taxes.

Lots of variations of croissants (which I am a fan of) would go back to try the matcha croissant for sure!

This place lacks a star because it was very well designed and there are some rolls that have good price point and the taste is good but it lacks that extra \"oomph\" or the \"je ne sais quoi\" factor to nudge it to a 5 star... Either way it is worth the visit with a lovely patio as well."}
{"text":"On my first visit here, the only thing I did was take a few samples and then leave hahaha

I came back and I got the bun with both pork floss and bonito flakes (I forgot the actual name of the bun) for $3.50 & it was surprising a good combo. The prices for the pastries are little more pricer but they are made with quality. Along with that, I got chatime pearl milk tea. I was watching one of the employees making it and you could tell that she was new since she kept regarding the ingredients list for drinks. When I drank it, it was PERFECT! I just wanted to tell her that she was doing a vey good job. 

Will for sure come back and try their other pastries!"}
{"text":"I gave this bakery a second chance when it wasn't crowded in the AM on a weekday. Although I wouldn't choose this place as my go to place, due to their high pricing, here are the things that made me add a star to the review.

1. They greet you well when they're not busy and answer questions about their baked goods. Even when the newly hired cashier made me wait a little to figure out how to cash me out, I didn't mind, because he was very sincere and apologized for the wait.

2. Their House Blend coffee (forgot the brand they use) actually tastes good and it's stronger than the Americano.

3.  I tried the Crepe cake and was not disappointed. It was very soft and creamy.

4. If you go there early in the morning, you have a better chance of finding fresh bread. Almost all of them taste like cake, with the amount of fillings (walnuts, Goji berries, etc)

At busier times of the day or on the weekend, the story is different however. 
There are people running around hunting for \"freshly baked\" goods with trays and tongues in their hands like there's no tomorrow. I quickly ran away the first time I came here, cause I get claustrophobic easily. There's an isle of empty baskets, and shelves at the back where you'd expect to be bread in them. 

There are very few tables inside and there's no wifi or music. They can definitely improve in the variety of their bread."}
{"text":"An innovative and interesting fusion bakery. I had the vanilla millecrepe cake which was delicious and was much better than it looks. I also had the chiffon cupcake which was very fluffy and light but nothing particularly special about this one. I also got a pack of savoury cheese buns (5 in a bag). The only downside are the prices as they are above average cost. Bonus is this location features chatime bubble tea."}
{"text":"It was busy in there, and the shelves were pretty empty.  But I was here only for one thing, a croissant that has this liquidy yolky inside.  I think I saw the croissant I came here to buy, but before I touched anything, I wanted to ask someone that worked there to confirm.  So I asked the girl at the cash.  I said \"Excuse me\", and responded \"Just wait!\".  Wow......treating a customer like that.  She wasn't even really doing anything.  Not a good start.  In the end I just took a guess and bought the croissant hoping that it was what I came here for. 

The croissant was quite dry, and the liquidy interior wasn't as liquidy/lava like as in those deep fried sesame balls from dimsum.  The croissant part wasn't very buttery like what I would be looking for in a crossant.  It was more bready than I would would like.  And the price, I don't remember what it was, but it was quite high for a croissant.  With crappy staff attitude, medicore product, and high prices, not sure I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here and try the cake
I like the matcha sesame cake.  Strong matcha and sesame taste.
Will try other cake next time"}
{"text":"Whoa! So, I don't like to eat a ton of baked goods so when I do, they'd better be damn delicious. Bake Code fits the bill! The Gangnam Star is a tasty mix of cream cheese and kimchi. Really enjoyed that one. Another great option is the Double Cheese Ring, stuffed with cream cheese, cheese curds, walnuts and garlic butter. The sweeter stuff like the Earl Grey pastry is also really delicious and fresh. I feel like I could walk in and enjoy anything there, it all looked fantastic. 

I also grabbed a roasted milk tea with coconut jelly (no sugar) to drink on the walk home. Chatime shares the space with Bake Code, so the BBT menu is great.  

One thing, as other Yelpers noted: the space where the pastries live is all open, so when girls are playing with their hair or someone brings in a sneezy kid, there could be contamination. Shudder."}
{"text":"I know Bake Code is like everyone's favourite new bakery in this area, but I went here once and didn't really understand the hype. Granted, I did come here fairly late in the evening, so perhaps a lot of their stock was sold out and I was only left facing the leftovers. Perhaps my expectations were a little bit off as well, because I was expecting more of a pastry/patisserie-type bakery, but Bake Code is mostly bread. From their little booklet, it looks like they have TONS of really good looking breads and buns, but when I went the bun selection was pretty small. I was kind of disappointed, because I had wanted just a small snack, but had to settle for bringing two full loaves of bread home, as I was not about to just sit and eat the whole things there alone. I got the multigrain lychee roll and the brown sugar walnut roll. Both of the rolls were pretty decent, but nothing too remarkable, especially given that they were $5+ each. The brown sugar walnut roll doesn't really have much in it, just a slight sweetness from the sugar and raisins and maple essence or whatever else is in there. The lychee roll is a little more interesting, but the actual lychee flavour is pretty light. There is a lot of stuff going on in the roll though, with sunflower seeds and almond slices and such, and also a slight rose flavour because there are rose petals in there.

I'm going to have to return some time in the afternoon or something so I can really get the full experience. Hopefully next time there will be tons of exciting things to try!"}
{"text":"Got a coffee and a matcha red bean round bun. Coffee was typical and the bun was very well presented. Unfortunately, the taste wasn't anything special although it did taste like they used quality ingredients.. real red beans inside instead of paste. They also had a large selection of tasty looking buns but a lot of them were over $5 which seems kind of high for a croissant even if they looked well made."}
{"text":"If you like sweets then you will like this place.  Personally I thought it's an overpriced version of a Chinese bakery where the price is way cheaper.

They do have some weird combos like salted egg croissant.  Not too about that.  Also this location you have to pay for parking on the street."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I always saw it packed. They offered a lot of free samples of their bread which explains the amount of people in there. I bought the red bean loaf which was over $7, tiny and tasted very average. Overall overpriced place with fancy breads but not worth it."}
{"text":"Expensive and the quality of the products are not worth the price. I got the matcha and red bean bun. No matcha taste what so ever and the red bean over powered the bun."}
{"text":"Frankly, I am a little baffled at why people think the bakery is overpriced. I feel like the clientele are comparing it to traditional Asian bakeries when the standards aren't even the same. I'm not saying it's not on the higher-end, I think it's just not a fair comparison to the people who are leaving the 2 star reviews. While they do have some items that you can get from those Chinese bakery, they have a lot more unique pastries that makes sense for them as a business to price accordingly to their brand. 

If you go to other western bakeries, the prices are pretty on par. For example, if I go to a bakery for a plain croissant it ends up costing me $4. For an extra $1 here, I am paying for the quality ingredients going into making the filling. And if you sit in at any other cafe, a cake slice is like $7.

That being said, I have had some experiences at Bake Code where some baked goods that are a hit and miss for me. But it has more to do with personal taste because they have such a wide variety of baked goods. I definitely have some go-to items I would return for: molten charcoal egg yolk croissant, taro knot loaf, honey castella lava cake.

But honestly, I really appreciate a kitchen that is always re-inventing and coming up with new culinary inventions. It would be nice if they scaled down the quantity to improve the consistency issue with some of their pastries. The only major thing for me is that I wish they would be more mindful of the end of the day baked goods. I think they should consider that their pastries does get stale after 7pm and if it's near closing time, they should discount their baked goods. It's really disheartening to pay for food that's not in fresh condition. Maybe they should consider getting covers to protect the bread."}
{"text":"Adorable setting, impressive selection of bread and very unique flavours but when I went to check on the pastries, there were few to almost no options. They also have a chatime express in the store but seating is very limited (about 4-5 mini tables) only. 

The only flaw was that they had two cash registers but only one was being used and the cashier was super slow so the line was being held up but no other staff picked up the speed by opening up the other register."}
{"text":"Tried the purple potato latte, some savoury pastries (the ones that don't contain mayo) and overall, it is recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always busy so you can expect freshness unless you're coming during closing. Quite a selection of sweet and savoury. My favourites are croissant brûlée, and any of their croissants. Especially the salted egg ones. Get it heated up and it oozes out like lava. They also have an assortment of buns and bread like the typical pork floss, pizza, hotdog flavours. I think they discontinued the gangham knot which was kimchi and cream cheese bread. Sounds weird, but it really works. Hope they bring that back. Currently enjoying a cheesy, mushroom croissant. So flaky and rich. Pairing it with a new drink, hot purple potato latte. Does not disappoint. Service on fleet today. hahaha. The drink selection is not huge however. There's a patio in the summer and some seats inside."}
{"text":"Tried their crepe cakes (vanilla and green tea) and both were delicious. A little pricey for my liking but would be a nice treat once in a while."}
