{"text":"We do take-outs from this place occasionally. Food is all right and the service is slow. I would say order beforehand via phone, if you want to avoid the wait time. The highlights are the mutton rolls and the vadas. OMG the vadas are the best I had in GTA ( yup including the GuruLuxumi's). I wish they carry some chutneys for dipping the vadas."}
{"text":"This place is good, prices are very reasonable and the food is tasty. Agree with one of the other posters that it is spicy but that is expected with Sri Lankan food.
Four stars for the Crab curry, Chicken rolls, bite size samosas, spring rolls.
The other food is A-OK and if you like spicy and Sri Lankan food, good place to go. Order ahead as it is often a wait but the food is always fresh and the staff is accommodating."}
{"text":"This is basically the only Sri Lankan take our place I order from. Quick tip: to avoid a long wait, call ahead to place your order. They will have it ready for you. Everything is tasty. I like the coconut appams, they're a real treat. The vaadai's are also spectacular and nothing beats a mutton roll. I've had almost everything on the menu except kottu roti, not my fav in general."}
{"text":"Very slow service if there 3 people in line be prepared to spend half hour just for take out buffet meal !!"}
{"text":"This is my weekly go to for lunch. I normally get the chicken biryani which comes with two pieces of chicken, rice, a hard boiled egg and a onion salad to help with the heat. I normally get 2 eggs and two salads so I can make two meals out of it. The portions are huge and always are consistent. These normally cost 8.50 to 9.25 with the extra egg.

This is strictly a takeout restaurant. The lady who works there always remembers me and always lets me know what else I might like from the menu. 

Recently, I was a little more adventurous and tried their chili chicken wrap. Man o man, I've been missing out. This is 5/5 for flavour if you like spicy. It is also only $5. Its definitely hard to find a lunch for less then $5 today."}
{"text":"Have been to this takeaway place multiple times. Have had quite a few things, amongst them a veggie thali, Masala dosa, onion dosa, kottu rotti, idlis, medu wadas, daal wadas, boonda, and today an Egg Kottu Rotti. 

The egg kottu rotti is quite different then veggie kottu rotti. There is a bunch of veggie curries added to the rotti and so it becomes moist. Egg Kottu rotti is all eggs and rotti. With some spices and herbs. Quite good. But I find the veggie kottu rotti much better and value. The egg rotti quantity is quite less. 

Do order a veggie thali, the quantity is humongous and the rice quantity is unbelievable. The choice of curries changes every day, but if there is Mushrooms curry make sure you buy that extra. The best I have ever had. 

The onion dosa, a bit better than Masala dosa as the masala dosa is almost all potatoes. 

The servers behind the counter are extremely generous and fill the containers to the brim."}
{"text":"Tried more items.  Tried the veggie thali and it was pretty good.  $1.00 extra for separate containers and $1.00 extra for brown rice.  The noodles and the biryani are underwhelming and have little to be desired. No flavour, just tastes hot."}
{"text":"One of many go to places for Spicy Sri Lankan Cuisine.  I ask for everything super spicy and boy do they ever accommodate me.  I usually pop in just for the \"short eats\" but every once and a while I try something new.   I find the service super slow but it is all worth the wait.  Plenty of parking.  It is take-out only and be advised that there is no such thing as Air Conditioning in this or any other Sri take-out joint I have ever visisted.  lol.  The extreme heat is all part of the Sri Lankan experience.  I ordered a Chicken Biryani, veggie cutlets, and a couple mutton rolls.  This was my first time ordering the Chicken Biryani.  I found out that the Chicken in the Biryani was deep fried. ?!?!?  Interesting to say the least."}
{"text":"We went there once.. I'm from US and was traveling to Niagara Falls. Took mutton kottu and it was the bomb. Spicy and better than most of the kottu I had in Sri Lanka. Too bad we won't be coming back as we live in US otherwise will be ordering from there everyday!!"}
{"text":"\"Please.\"

It's a phrase you will hear every time someone walks up to the counter. It's his way of saying, \"Go ahead, tell me what you want.\" Or he's trying to tell you to hurry up and that's his polite way of communicating it.

Sri Lankan food is stupid spicy, and may not be for everyone, but I am a huge, huge fan. Well, I should say I'm a huge fan of things like the Kothu Roti (Roti + egg, chicken, beef, etc. + spices all chopped up into a delicious dish). If you are uncertain about what to order, get the Egg Kothu Roti and some Mutton Rolls. You cannot go wrong with either of those menu items. Unless you cannot handle any kind of heat. The prices are really cheap (in my humble opinion). The average meal (or snack) shouldn't set you back more than $4-7. Or at least that's about all I've ever spent when I stop by. And the flavors are on point, adding to the overall satisfaction in knowing you didn't spend a lot of money. The cutlets are not great though. I would avoid those things, because it's mostly potato acting as filler, and very little meat to speak of.

Also, I'm not usually one to call others out about their reviews because \"opinion,\" or \"freedom of speech,\" or some such nonsense, but WTF to the other review for this place. There aren't any actual complaints in the review, the pictures (and captions) show love for the mutton rolls, he admits that he pops in every once in a while (which means he doesn't hate it). And despite all of this, Annapoorna still gets a \"Meh\"? Criminy... This is why people hate Yelpers."}
