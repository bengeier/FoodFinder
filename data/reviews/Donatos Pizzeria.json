{"text":"I have not had any terrible experiences at this location.  One time pizza was late and in the box a little disheveled possibly from bad driving. Other then that, I have had great experiences and I am a 3-4 times a month customer. Zinger all the way. Thin crust. Their breadsticks are exactly like Fazollis. I mean exactly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like their pizza bread. The spicy jack was tasty but the bread still messed it up for me. I give it 3 stars for friendly service and table full of puzzles, books, games, etc. for the kiddos."}
{"text":"I have big problems with this place.  The staff has been rude every single time I've visited, and I've dealt with all of their high school drop outs at one point or another.  The most recent time I went, it took 20 minutes to get a burnt hot pocket, with only one other diner in the place.

Previously, I'd tried their pizza, and knew not to get it.  I thought I'd go for something else, and that failed.  Their pizza has a weird, overpowering tang that really makes me grimace.  It's the sauce they use, and I look around at others like \"Are you not tasting that?  What IS that?\"

It's OK though, there are tons of pizza options in Huntersville & Cornelius, and while I've tried almost all of them (Bullzeye was the clear best before it unceremoniously closed down), it's completely worth the drive to go to Little Caesar's, rather than resigning yourself to this place.

The only good thing you could say about Donatos is that it's clean.  The parking lot situation there is abysmal, so I can't even say you'll find a space.  You're better off that way, maybe... I noticed Target next door has a Pizza Hut Express built in.  At least you know you're getting cardboard crust when you go there, so you won't be as surprised by how poor it is."}
