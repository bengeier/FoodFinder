{"text":"Pho tasted good, well flavored, decent portion, location is easy to find,  big signage right at the corner of Kennedy and Sheppard,  Waitress checked on us twice to see if we needed anything, and was polite.  We will be back to try out other plates the next time we are the area."}
{"text":"We dropped by opening weekend, so we knew there would be issues since they just opened. But what we got was far worse.
We ordered 
R.11 : Grilled chicken, pork chop with grilled beef on steamed rice $10.25 X 2 orders
TO GO
Since it was 9pm and our 8 month old was getting sleepy, we decided to order take out to go, it it was late so we didn't think to check the 4 Styrofoam take out boxes as we left. When we got home this is what we got:
2 containers of rice, 1 container with 1 piece of flattened chicken breast, and 1 container of a beef strip.
Remember, we said we ordered 2 servings? Well we only got 1, and not only that, but wheres the pork chop? It is the most expensive of the broken rice dishes, yet we didn't even get the full 2 servings, or even 1 full serving. There was meat missing, and it took 3 people to take down our order and yet it was still wrong. 

Now here's the best part:

Our order total that we were charged was $20.50 so, 
if $10.25 x 2= $20.50 X $1.13 (HST) = $23.17
What exactly did we get charged for? Looking at their to go menu that I took (in case we wanted to ever go back (what a joke right?)) I am trying to add up different combinations to see what the heck we ordered, or what they chose. But so far nothing.

This place has been under renovations for months, and when they finally opened I was slightly excited to have a Vietnamese Pho restaurant within walking distance. But I guess new tables and chairs can't help this failing business. They probably should have taken an extra week to teach their menu to their front-end staff as well as their cooks. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I will not be returning to this location. Avoid at all costs.

{"text":"I should've heeded my mother's warnings and not to walk into a store if they're empty in the evening.

The owner was trying to be pleasant but she came off very pushy.  

The kicker waaaaas:
The portions and prices did not even compare.  
The prices here were higher than your average pho joint - a large pho and a rice came to $20??? 

The other reviews here were fairly accurate.
The special pho was minimal in all aspects: minimal flavour, minimal beef, minimal noodles... 

Don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Another new Asian restaurant opened at this location. I really lost count of how many since Just Dessert closed down.

Good pho is not easily to find in this area. And Pho Vu looks promising and with Grand Opening Special it worth me to give it a try.

Menu is simple with most of Vietnamese usual casual eats.

Pho Special Regular ($7.95) has this light herb soup broth and all the meat toppings were well prepared. Portion size is decent.

Spring Roll ($4.95) so crispy with taro and porking filling.

Service is excellent with the waitress checking on me asking if everything is ok. 

Will be back to try out other noodles option.

Cash only.

Parking at this plaza though not easy which is always busy and super tight."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  i drove by seeing the giant 15% off banner and got suckered in.  (but i did not notice the small fine print... it was only for 1 day that has passed)

first off, the entrance is difficult to find and locate if you drive.  just seemed inconvenient.   

we were greeted by the waitress who was pleasant... 

i got the menu.. prices were average to a bit on the higher side.. about 9.50 before tax for a rice if i recall?

As i ate the rice, i cannot comment on the noodles... but DAMN what a horrible impression i had...  the pic doesnt do justice.  talk about STINGE..

there was like NO meat!  it was burnt.. i kid you not.. if you put the shredded burnt meat together it was less than one spoon... 

and for that reason and that reason only.. i will not return."}
