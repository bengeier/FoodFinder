{"text":"Muy buena comida  y sobre todo muy buen servicio la senorita Erika muy amable siempre atenta a todo lo k necesitaba"}
{"text":"Great place and amazing food at very reasonable prices. I had the grilled octopus  (pulpo asado). The price is $15 and I was expecting to get a small appetizer. I got surprised by a huge full portion that had the entire octopus. I've never eaten the whole thing. Most restaurants give you a few pieces for this price, but at Mariscos El Puerto I got a full pound or more of pure meat.  The service is also very friendly. All the servers were constantly checking on me ready to fulfill my needs.    You have to enjoy also Mexican mariachi and you will fall in love with this nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Best calamari in town!!! Camarones a la diabla were perfect not too spicy and the rice and beans even had great flavor!"}
{"text":"Shitty camarones a la diabla!! Fucken cook does not know how to peal the shell off!! Shrimp Moral of the story is don't listen to co working on where to eat for lunch, cause literally our waitress was someone different every time they came by."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I've been here twice and have not been disappointed. The area is pretty small, I would say that is the only down fall."}
{"text":"Everything is bomb!!!!!! Great service ! great food! I had the camarones  al veneno...absolutely  scrumptious!  My girlfriend had camarones al mojo de ajo - so delicious -great flavor!  The Micheladas - estillo - aguas chile ----------- loved it !"}
{"text":"Good Food! Great Service !! Only downfall is wait for a table is long,but it is worth it !!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everyone is friendly, my favorite thing to order is the cazuela sinaloense (ceviche) highly recommended."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited this place for our first time and we were very impressed.  Upon our arrival, it appeared very busy; however, we were seated rather quickly. We waited maybe about 10 minutes to place our drink order, which was a little longer than what we expected, but when the waitress approached us, she first apologized and thanked us for our patience, of course we understood. Overall, customer service was on point. The entire staff was phenomenal and the food was delicious, as well as the live music!!!  It reminded us of Ports O' Call in San Pedro. We had such a great experience that we are going back with a big group of friends tomorrow to celebrate my finances birthday. It's a must visit."}
{"text":"OMG .... everything was GREAT!!! Service... top notch They kept coming around to ask how we were doing Food ... excellent fresh seafood and excellent taste and top it off MICHEALADA WAS GREAT!!! Check it out"}
{"text":"everything was good here came with my parents on a monday and food was cooked right and perfect will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Best mariscos spot in Las Vegas, this is our first time here we order a Tostada Suprema, it's huge flavor the best, and a Michelada preparada great service, our waitress Carla was asking if everything was fine all the time.  Definitely will come back for round two."}
{"text":"Nuestro lugar favorito para comer mariscos .. sin duda alguna lo recomiendo el personal muy amable"}
{"text":"Un lugar muy bueno,un servicio 5 estrellas de la señorita Erika.....recomiendo a todos"}
{"text":"..i'm here every other weekend ..the food is exceptionally delicious ..the micheladas are addicting ..and the service is great ..tell Hector the owner that I sent you ..show him my picture and he'll give you a discount"}
{"text":"This place was better than that place in San pedro ca. Great food,  good prices and good portions."}
{"text":"Los mejores mariscos que eh probado en mi vida, todo está delicioso, el servicio es excelente las preparadas son únicas en las vegas definitivamente tienen que venir a probarlos 100% recomendado ! ME ENCANTA!!"}
{"text":"Love their food and their drinks. This is my TGIF place to be for my michelada fix after a long work week. Highly recommend if you want some good seafood and tasty drinks!"}
{"text":"The attention and the service the food it was so big and delicious I recommend this restaurant seafood restaurant to everyone and the best of all Carla the waitress she's so kind and the attention did she provide to us it was great smile all the time s******* one of the best great attention grateful I'm so happy with thank you"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Que servicio más perfecto!! Gracias Karla por darnos uno de los mejores servicios que hemos recibido en este lugar, comida perfectamente elaborada y fresca!! Se los recomiendo 100%!! No se van a arrepentir!!"}
{"text":"This place is very Mexican such as the San Pedro area Baja California typestyle Mexican seafood the spices are delicious and not at all hot. The music was a little loud when we got here but we asked the waitress if they could turn it down some and she graciously did. The service where is outstanding the portions are huge and there was people from different cultures coming to eat here. The waitresses are bilingual and so you can expect them to answer your questions but in English and Spanish the service that they provide was very helpful as far as they answered all her questions and they were able to guide us on what to order. We had plenty left over and it was all packed up for us to take home for leftovers. There is also a children's menu and they have to serve chicken fingers for your picky eaters.keep an open mind when you can and I hope you enjoy your food is much as we did"}
{"text":"We came in really thirsty and hungry because we had just left another seafood place because we got sat and ordered drinks right away; 30 minutes later we had no drinks and others were served drinks that came in after us. There was no communication or any signal of when we would get our drinks. So we decided to leave and we made our way to Mariscos el Puerto.   They were really busy, but their communication with us was on point. This experience was totally different than the first. We only waited about 5 minutes to be sat. We asked to get switched to another table and they did not hesitate. They made us feel comfortable and asked to be a little patient at the beginning, since they were busy. Leticia was our server and she made sure that we were happy with our food and service. She made sure everything was good and helped fix our ceviche, because we were expecting something different. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Prices where good and food was authentic. Music playing complementary of the restaurant while you enjoy your food"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their shrimp and octopus cocktail. I'm very picky about cocktails too Bc I don't like them sweet, and a lot of the sauces are on the sweet side. Theirs is great and keep me coming back"}
{"text":"We came here while visiting Las Vegas, the place was very clean, the food was amazing. The music was a bit loud but the food made up for it, very fresh and tasty, large portions. Will return here on my next Las Vegas trip. Delicious!"}
{"text":"California boy over here out to party in Las Vegas and so I needed some of that delicious seafood to help with my hangover. I yelped this place and came to try it out. I can vouch for this place as a pretty good mariscos spot. I tried a shrimp tostada, its completely raw so be aware of that upon ordering. You can choose cooked shrimp if you'd like. I also got their version of the San Pedro shrimp and I must say it was delicious. I eat at San Pedro's ports o'call a few times a year and I will recommend this to anyone who enjoys that type of seafood. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mariscos el Puerto was amazing..the service was great..about a 20 min wait but so worth it. Live music, great drinks and amazing food. We live a block and a half away and plan on going again. We actually were going to go somewhere else to eat, but as we were waiting the one man band sang a song that my mother in law use to love so my husband said wait he wanted to hear it, as soon as the song ended the hottest called us for our table. Waitress3s kept checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything else..they even boxed up our left overs...great place to eat and enjoy the Mexican music. You can either eat inside or out on the patio. I highly recommend Mariscos el Puerto"}
{"text":"1st time here for dinner last night & it was by far one of the best Hispanic restaurants I've had.   The best salsa in Las Vegas & let's not forget the live entertainment from the band.  Fabulous service with a smile."}
{"text":"Love the food, specials, service we have our favorite server Brenda but the only thing is music is too loud way too loud hope they can do something about it because every time I go I come out with a headache from the loud music"}
{"text":"Primera vez que vengo a este lugar,la comida muy picante,incomible!!!..ojo!!!...no toda las personas comemos demasiado picante,quise disfrutar de unos ricos y apetitosos mariscos,pero me fue imposible y que decir de la michelada(súper PICANTE).!!!! Y para acabarla!!!...limpian las mesas con un limpiador que huele a baño público,cuiden ese detalle."}
{"text":"It's like a dive bar and a seafood shack in San Diego had a baby. I don't know how it ended up in a shady section of North Decatur, but it works.   Menu has ceviches, shrimp cocktails, and several platters of grilled and fried sea creatures, served in a beach-decor setting by friendly female staff. The tostadas are low-priced with generous portions (I like the shrimp and octopus), and it's the only place in town I've yet found to get a marlin taco.  This place is pretty popular, so call in your order if you're in a hurry. If you dine in, consider bringing ear plugs, because the music is crazy loud. Or just order a Michelada and you'll hardly notice."}
{"text":"Lunch time with coworkers ,  the atmosphere is fun. Lots of TVs to enjoy the copa America tournament . The service is fantastic,  Mara was friendly and took her time explaining the menu items and specials. The food is delicious, I ordered a campechana,  by far the best campechana I have had in Las Vegas,  very very delicious."}
{"text":"My newest most tastiest spot for seafood in town. The customer service was and is always courteous. They attend their guests and assist you very well. If you're looking for a taste of Mexican seafood try their delicious coctel de camaron or tostadas de ceviche. There are so many choices and options for every seafood lover out there, I recommend this place for anyone who wants to taste the best seafood place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Living in Vegas for 1 year only we thought we'd never find a great Mariscos restaurant ~Mexican style like in California but we did! The service was excellent & the food was the best! We had a tray/platter with fried whole fish, grilled shrimp, veggies potatoes & calamari with garlic bread. The lemonade was truly the best fresh made daily we've ever had. The music is a little loud but gives good energy vibe. Servers/host & management make you feel like family & seem very appreciative for our business. This is a gem and will bring our visiting family soon. We'll be back often"}
{"text":"This place has good, authentic seafood. The service is good, and the ambiance is very casual. They try to replicate a sea side village feel. They don't completely achieve it, but it's fun. My only issue is the volume of the music. Way too loud. Music playing should never interfere with conversation with the person sitting across from you. Overall...slightly above average."}
{"text":"I had the mariscos estilo like San Pedro ones definitely were delicious I love me the estilo Nayarit micheladas"}
{"text":"This place is the worse place to eat the service is awful I never recommend to anybody to try this place please people don't waste your money at this place"}
{"text":"I think that Mariscos el puerto is possibly the bet mariscos in town.  The ceviche camarón is the best I've ever had (don't let my mom find out). Everything is super fresh. You can taste in every bite.  They make this mango preparada that has al large bells and whistles. I can't describe how mouth watering it is. They have many other flavors too including original. Coco fresca! They literally have it all.  On to the best part, my first time here Monique, took very good care of me. She made me feel like part of the family. Told me about all that they have to offer. Helped me make my choices. Her service is second to none and as a service industry worker myself I can't explain how I appreciate it.   All in all, if you're looking for bomb Mariscos and great service, Mariscos El Puerto has it going on!   THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Best mexican seafood in las vegas by far..sorry I didn't take pictures of my molcagete...to busy eating it..my server was on top of things she was great..very cool place....loooveeee it I'm a regular for sure from now on..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for legit Mexican seafood this is the place to go . Our server Mara took care of us really helpful and knowledgeable about the entrees."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great drinks. It quickly became our go to spot for mariscos in Vegas. We've been there at least 20 times now and not one disappointing visit. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  The food is Delicious. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  All the styles of preparadas are awesome. The servers and owner is such a sweetheart. I go back at least 3 times a month"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent!!! The seafood molcajeta is really good and the tostadas are huge!! I definitely have found the place to go for Mexican seafood in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best spots in Vegas! Liz was the best waiter she was so helpful & she was really accommodating. I will be coming back! The fried ice cream is fire"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food with friendly service! Their shrimp ceviche left me speechless."}
{"text":"Excelente comida !! Las bebidas son muy ricas ! Las micheladas están deliciosas , y la atención es excelente en este lugar , súper recomendado ."}
{"text":"Simple: Best, bombest, hands down los mejores mariscos in town!! Preparadas are just as good too"}
{"text":"My gawd! I almost don't want to leave a review because if I do more people will know about this gem and it won't be a hidden treasure! Sighs. This place has thee best seafood in Nevada. Repeat. The BEST SEAFOOD IN NEVADA! I love culture and authentically ethnic establishments. Spanish music plays and the customers chat like family with each other! Oh my!!!! Some of the wait staff only speak Spanish! Yessssssssss! I know very little Spanish so shame on me, I loved seeing everyone here being unapologetically Hispanic! Reminds me of a small place I visited in Puerto Rico. A tear drop will fall as I leave this place. I live down the street so I will be back....with my Spanish translator app in hand!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of variety on food & over priced, drinks are always made different even though you ask for the same one. People mostly like coming here because they don't ask for I.D. when you order alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here it's kind of small so they are usually crowded with people :)   The first time I came I ordered aguachilis (not sure how you spell it) and it was to spices for me I guess they couldn't make it less spicy which sucks since that's my favorite dish   I got a shrimp cocktail and we ordered a bunch of drinks  I got a Michelada first which was delicious and then a mojito and last was the watermelon drink   All of them were yummy and very tasty   They have live bands that come around and will sing u a song at your request   I'll come back for sure"}
{"text":"Eehh not for me, A. I don't like when I enter a restaurant & the music is on full blast it's not a club! B. tostada de aguachiles was not the business they don't devein the shrimp & the tacos were just ok."}
{"text":"Pros: Affordable seafood with large family style platter, Large Variety and drinks.  Cons: humid and hot, Extremely disorganized from the hostess to waitress service, Waited 30mins to get sat and 25 minutes to actually get a waitress to give us greet is after being seating, Spanish is the primary language, extremely loud battle of the bands, $10 per song ridiculous, seating is cramped, wait staff didn't seem to have designated tables, one waitress went attended to people that got sat 10mins after to the left of us literally skipped over ignoring us and went to the table on our right. There clearly don't abide by good alcohol practices by cutting customers off after they are clearly super super drunk. The seafood platter revived had a ton of over cooked, oily vegetables than seafood items. Won't go there ever again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. They have large portions and live music. Great place for a family dinner on Sundays. The molcajete was fire."}
{"text":"Very nice servers and very helpful. Great food and very nice portions. Love the music that comes with this experience. My only reason for 3 stars is because as I saw the workers clean the tables, they spray the tables with chemicals while the bottles of hot sauce are open and that made me not want to use this hot sauce. lol Small but it matters."}
{"text":"Casual ambience, the service is good as well. You sit yourself and there's plenty of seating.  So far I've only had the shrimp cocktail and it's pretty good. The prices are pretty average for seafood here as well. The only problem is the loud music, I don't mind listening to Spanish music but it's annoyingly loud and you find yourself talking over it.  Overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's always a struggle finding a great place that serves great food, accompanied by great service. This is a pretty small, hole in the wall restaurant which makes it feel comfortable, if that makes sense? I really enjoyed my food and by far this place has the best Caldo 7 Mares ever! Our waitress was top notch, excellent service. The seafood tastes very fresh and the price is decent, not exaggerated like other Mariscos restaurants that break the bank for small portions.   I recommend this place to anyone who asks because there's literally nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend on a slow Tuesday night. Was directed to pick a table and when I asked a waitress if the table was available I got a scowl in return. A very nice girl finally greeted us with menus 10 mins later. We order the aguachile and 2 micheladas to start. I also let her know that I would be ordering a 2nd dish to share a little later on. Mind you, I speak fluent spanish so the communication was clear. The aguachile arrived with no tostadas, I had to ask a busser for tostadas because the waitresses were somewhere hiding in the back. We finished the aguachile and sat there for another 10 mins until I finally stood up and walked to their server station to order our 2nd entree. Asking for a box and the bill took some more trying to flag someone down and getting ignored as well. I've never had such horrible service in my life!"}
{"text":"Finally! Vegas gets a really good Mexican sea food place. My dad had heard about their San Pedro style shrimp platters so we had to come check it out. We order the shrimp tray and it was really good. It came with garlic bread and lots of veggies (onion, bell pepper & potatoes). The seasoning on it was really close to the ones in San Pedro. We also had their fried tilapia. The place started to get pack after we arrived so we got lucky. Can't wait to come back and bring friends with me."}
{"text":"This was a good seafood restaurant. It exceeded my expectations. The food was good and the service was good. The service was really good. You enter this restaurant and it feels like you are in Baja California Cabo. Like I say the service was good.   If you go to any restaurant today Red lobster,Outback etc the staff working there are unhappy bad service this people don't want to be there and don't want to serve you they only smile at you when is time to pay the bill.   You will not find that in this restaurant the stuff in this restaurant still have that innocents they treat you good without expecting a tip."}
{"text":"Gracias sue por todo !!!!! This place is great! And our waitress sue was the best!!!! I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Los mejores especiales en comidas y bebidas con las  mejores meseras y más guapas de Las Vegas"}
{"text":"los mejores antojos en las vegas los tiene mariscos el puerto , las meseras son muy amables,la comida esta muy rica, el ambiente esta muy bien exelente servicio 100 % recomendable"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this place but im very disappointed cause they serve warm beer!!!! All the time i come here they beer is hot cause the use the same refrigerator for everything like sodas, etc,etc, beer should be seriously served cold !! Specially in a seafood restaurant, food is ok, im impressed with the cleaning in the restroom is outstanding!! But the beers is a big problem if you are going to eat mariscos!! So people plan ahead and call to tell the staff to put your beers in ice if you really want to enjoy the time and food. To the owner don't be cheap and buy another refrigerator only for beers."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour to be seated for our party of eight, just for the waiter to seat two people on our table and he said he would seat them somewhere else but then disappeared. We ended up leaving because the waiter did what he said he would."}
{"text":"Went in for the special they advertise on the website 1/2 price for the \"Charolas\" (the platers) from 2-5 are group got in around 3:40 and we order drinks and all when we asked and verified about the players to the waiter she states that the special has changed and that the special starts at 8. We explain to her that the website doesn't reflect that and if we could actually talk to the manager. Mean while we are also talking to another employee that says that they do have the special and that is until 5. Are waiter comes back and says that NO MANAGER IS available and that only the kitchen manager is there and that he will not come to talk to us. If the website wouldn't of reflected the special we would of not made a big deal but the fact that it changed and they have not updated any information and we are getting mix information from the waiter was very upsetting , the fact that no manager was on duty is crazy. If they are doing the special just a couple hours later why not accommodate the customer. My group and I ended walking out.  Very disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"So my wife and I had ceviche tostadas as an appetizer, really raw shrimp no spice no flavor no nothing. We asked for veneno shrimp and those were so so but the sides were horrible. Rice tasted like vinegar and their salad is bad!!! Not coming back."}
{"text":"Feels like home. Bring the family and prepare to be amazed. Authentic as it gets, amazing atmosphere, fantastic food, great vibe. Oh... and they have $1 beers!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service from all employees we came across. Food was great, good flavor & fresh seafood. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Mariscos place ever ! Their food is amazing as well as the drinks ! If your looking for a place with great service amazing food and a great atmosphere this is the place to come to !"}
{"text":"Great food service and price, first 3 beers are $1,  daily special as like the Dan Pedro tray, wow big for 4 people only $14.99 on Mondays.  Its my new seafood place. Hope u go soon and try the ceviches."}
{"text":"Place lacks of good customer service, from menu to appetizers to speed when it comes to serving. It is a pretty new establishment so I'll give them three stars  cause I understand they'll have to make some mistakes to learn how to efficiently run a business other than that food is good, prices are also ok I mean everywhere you go is about the same or I should say nothing is cheap these days..... Anyways try you'll like it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Real Mexican seafood!! Michelada on point!! You get what you pay for , delicious!!"}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this spot while in las Vegas, boy let me tell you the food, service,and drinks were awesome and cheap. We went twice within the weekend!!"}
{"text":"Very Good Mexican Seafood restaurant. Everything we ordered was SO YUMMY!!!. For drinks, we ordered the Watermelon Sangria. It really came in a half size Watermelon shell with chunk of Watermelon inside, red sauce around it ...great for sharing. So Good and Tasty!!!   The clams with shrimp was So Yummy. Wish we ordered more of it. Then we had the Mix Seafood Pot. It had the whole fry fish, big shrimp, octopus, etc.... Had a creamy sauce inside pot. Very Good!!! Lots of favor.  The seafood with bread was delicious.   Buttery bread, shrimp and octopus stir fry with onions, bell pepper and potatoes and side of calamari. Love it!! This is my new favorite Mexican Seafood restaurant. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place has unbeatable customer service!! I wasn't quite pleased with the dish I got but I understood that these things happen when you get a new dish but when the owner heard I didn't like it he made it his mission to help me modify the dish until I liked it. Needless to say, in the end my food was super delicious. I was so grateful for the staff going above in beyond for me and making my experience a great one. I'll be back for sure and will continue to bring friends and family here."}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say I was more pleased with the service than the food. The serves where super friendly and smiled a lot, but the food was not the best I have had of the same kind. We ordered some oysters to begin with and they were super good and cold the best part of the meal but the main dish the MOLCAJETE MIXTO was something else , the chicken tasted old and dry, the shrimp were not cleaned or deveined, the sauce it contained was bland and the vegetables were raw, the tortillas were not hand made like at other places and it just completely fell below expectations,"}
{"text":"Pedi un caldo de 7 meres 15 minutos antes de que nos sentarán en la mesa \"porque se que el caldo se tarda un poco en estar listo\". Nos sentamos y ordenamos 2 cocktles. Los cocktles llegaron a la mesa 15 minutos después de ordenar. Time como 20 minutos para terminarme mi cocktail y el caldo a un no llegaba. Despues de que le pregunte a La mesera sobre el caldo me dijo que el caldo ya estaría listo en 5 minutos mas. En total casi 1 hora en esperar el caldo 7 mares. La mesera regresa a la mesa y nos dice que el caldo se lo entregaron a la mesa equivocada y que si gustamos lo podía volver a ordenar. Esto no es aceptable y no regresare a este negoció jamás. Espero que el dueño cambie esto para que no pierda más clientes."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is very authentic. Live music inside and three outdoor tables. It can get very loud with the music and crowd talking over it. The inside gets a little warm and stuffy when it's busy. I can imagine it's very warm during the summer months. Service could use some improvement. Especially if you sit outside. We were a little forgotten about being outside. Waited a long time for our bill before we went inside to get it. The menu needs more description for the items. For example none of the alcohol drinks have any ingredients listed. So you're constantly asking the poor server questions regarding ingredients. Same for the food. The Molcajete we ordered had no ingredients listed.  The Food... Molcajete Mixo was excellent! None of us were picky eaters nor did we have food allergies to worry about. There was a whole grilled chicken in there. Seasoned and grilled to perfection! It went great with the Molcajete sauce everything was covered in. There was also shrimp (both shelled and unshelled), potatoes, a few crab legs, chopped octopus, peppers, onions, steak, chorizo, bacon wrapped jalapeño and a glorious slab of griddled cheese.   Their salsa was very good and is served with crackers and tostada shells that you break into tortilla chips.   The queso fundido was flavorful and really good. We ended up getting a plain cheese one. I would order it with chorizo or some kind of meat & salsa combination next time.    The drinks... Some of their micheladas are almost a meal in itself. Served in gutted coconut with chopped octopus, shrimp, cucumber slices, pineapple slices, coconut meat and smothered in a sweet & spicy sauce. It honestly could have been an appetizer.   Save room for dessert! We split the fried ice cream and it was delicious! Cherry ice cream with chunks of cherry inside a perfectly crusted and fried ball. They serve it in a cinnamon sugar crispy bowl with a few dollops of whipped cream topped with sprinkles.   The indoor ambiance needs improving.  I'd come back despite the few minor issues for the food. It is solid! Well prepared and presented at a very reasonable price for the contents and proportions."}
{"text":"Food very tasty, great environment...food prices are good...I really like this place!!"}
{"text":"Mara was very attentive and corteous, great service, very friendly and nice. We ordered 2 classic charolas and it was very good definitely a lot of food.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"I really tried to give a better review but there are simply to many factors that would not allow me to. Firstly, it took way to long to be seated all the while there were clearly a few open tables available. The place was swelteringly hot inside. The restrooms were dirty as heck.   A very nice young server took out order, no complaints about the service, she worked hard often coming by to make sure we were good. I asked for Diet Coke, they didn't have any, I asked for Ice tea, they didn't have any, I asked for root beer they didn't have any... Finally I just got a lemonade which was way overpriced. All in all my wife and I spent 68 dollars for our dinner w no dessert. Way to expensive for being so raunchy."}
{"text":"Where should I start. 1.It's very loud. 2.The service was bad and slow the waitress Isabel didn't tell ud about the menu specials until we finished eating. 3. Overpriced we ordered the shrimp tray$30 which serves 3 and paid $6 extra for no shell and the amount of shrimp was more for an appetizer for one. 4. I asked four servers for my check and it took 20 minutes . 5. The menu is only in Spanish.  I don't recommend it and definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I ordered the ceviche Sinaloaense and it was  unlike anything I tried before. It was lemony and spicy with Guacamaya hot sauce. The service was amazing! All the staff was helpful and our food was brought out promptly. The owner Hector was very welcoming.  On top of the great service and food there is an awesome deal for happy hour. First 3 beers for $1 ea!!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  The service is top notch and all the food we ordered was delicious. From the ostiones, aguachiles, camarones empanizados, carne asada, tacos de Marlin to the delicious micheladas. Played a round of golf across the street and ended it with this delicious treat. The only thing that was a bit loud was the live performers. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"When you step into this restaurant, you would swear that you have stepped into a Mariscos restaurant in Ensenada Mexico.  Between the tasty food and the gorgeous servers, this restaurant is one of the genuine bastions of culture and fun in Clark County."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Mariachi bands. A great experience. Our family will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"This is my second time I go and eat and I'm very disappointed at this place. My first time I went I order las Famosas charolas de San Pedro and there not even closed to taste like the originals from San Pedro California, and today I order Tostadas Mixtas, and for my taste and look is not MIXTAS !!!!! There MICHELADAS taste pure CLAMATO Will never go back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im writing this as a very happy customer this is the place I would head to for mariscos, very lively place. There ceviches are to die for & always fresh. They have a Monday thru Friday happy hour that you pay $2.00 a tostada and the proportions are big I get full with one. Plus, $1 for your first three beers. I just had dinner & spent $4.00 for myself. Beers included lol I'm ecstatic."}
{"text":"Amazing food great quality of shrimp and fish family enviroment so bring the whole family ask for mona she is great server and very friendly the whole staff was..."}
{"text":"Legit my favorite place. The meechis are perfect and the cocktails are delicious. I've never had tried one thing on the menu I didn't like. I love the fish tacos too!"}
{"text":"Stephanie was our waitress she was very attentive and helpful with menu since it was our first time there , We had aguachile tostada, pulpo and  camarón tostada, grilled huachinango, marlin taco and shrimp and pulpo cocktail .... EVERYTHING was amazing, tasty and fresh  I would  order everything all over again but next time I have to try molcajates."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall!The Preparadas/Micheladas are off the hook!Shrimp cocktail is loaded & filling.My favorite dish is Camarones Al Veneno.The plate is spicy,tangy & filling.Shrimp empanadas are also great.Highly recommend a Caguama Preparada"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I typically get attended well because everytime I come we spend and tip well. Unfortunately this time I came we weren't treated as good. We waited 3 minutes for some lemons for our food. Other than that food is great. The environment is  chill."}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD IVE HAD IN VEGAS also extremely cheap for what you get portions are HUGE and the vibe is so nice. i rarely write reviews but seriously this place is sooooo BOMB"}
{"text":"First time here and we love it!! The shrimp platter and micheladas are amazing and portions are generous. Def coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best restaurants I been too. Service and food we're amazing. Staff was super friendly and helpful. I will highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was so amazing... The service was Great... My new favorite Mexican seafood place in Vegas. The oysters were very fresh... The ceviche tostada was filled like a pyramid full of fresh tasting shrimp and just the right flavor."}
{"text":"We have a date night at least once a month and try to find new places to eat at. This was our Friday date night pick and I've got to say we were not disappointed. The food was amazing, I actually had the Mojarra Frita al mojo de ajo, best I've ever had. We all had something different and everything was great. The only complaint I had was the preparadas were not very tasty, too much celery and pepper  but that's it. The waitress Heidi was very attentive and sweet. We will definitely be back. Yummy"}
{"text":"I love places that put shrimp in their micheladas. Almejas Gratinadas are to die for...highly recommend. Everything has been amazingly tasty and fresh! Hands down to Magnificent service! A must try if you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place use to be my favorite if you want tostadas de pepino y tomate Agarren las de ceviche puro pepino y tomate nada de camarón, por favor arreglen esto"}
{"text":"This is some seriously good Mexican food. They specialize in seafood, and one of the dishes that is an absolute must try is their Molcajete. Molcajete is clay dish of deliciousness. They have two versions, the Molcajete de Marisco, this dish is all Seafood (Crab Legs, Octopus, Shrimp, and a Whole Fried Fish). The Molcajete Mixto is Seafood, Chicken, and Carne Asada. In addition to the meat and seafood, both versions are accompnied by diced red potatoes, onions, peppers, in the most amazing red spicy sauce. I think my favorite is the Mixto, as I think the chicken gave the sauce an extra bit of flavor. It  was so much food we had leftovers the next day that had sat and marinated all night in that magical sauce and OMG..... delicious!!! I would also recommend the Oysters with Shrimp Ceviche or the Fried Calamari as appetizers. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. It is fresh and has great flavor. The staff is very attentive, helpful, and friendly. We have eaten here several times and have always had a great experience.  We try something different each time and are never disappointed. Great family run restaurant and it's a family favorite for our family."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and very flavorful. The only down side to this place is that they hardly speak English so I really had to brush up on my Spanish but luckily a table next to me was kind enough to help out as well. Thank you to them."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant with traditional dishes. I highly recommend  the aguchiles and their micheladas. The majority of their food is prepared spicy, but you can ask them to calm it down a bit. They have large platters that are great to share with groups of 3-4 people. Awesome staff and great evironment. Also your first 3 beers are only a dollar, can't beat that deal!"}
{"text":"Brought my husband here for Father's Day. Was a little busy but so worth the wait. Had shrimp empanadas, ceviche de pescado (delish). He had the grilled marinaded shrimp. Was amazing. Never thought that we could find Mariscos this good in Vegas. Service was excellent. Always came back to check if we needed anything. My Spanish isn't the greatest but was able order/and chit chat with staff. Will definitely let friends/coworker's know about this place."}
{"text":"Exelente servicio la comida ke pedi hoy estuvo exquisita ,buen ambiente muy buen lugar para disfrutar en familia 100 % recomendado"}
{"text":"Best mariscos in Vegas! I've been coming to this place since it opened and even tho its became more known, their food quality and quantity has not changed. The food is delicious and they're drinks are bomb! Most places give you like 4-5 shrimps per tostada and lots of vegetables but this place is the opposite! I got full with two tostadas lol. Highly recommended, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem down the street from my work.  Ordered their ceviche de camaron which was good except they don't put avocado we had to ask.  Their mangoneadas are decent and their shrimp empanadas are good as well.  We also ordered the platter which was a huge portion that could easily serve 4 people & it was only $20!  It consisted of fried calamari, fried tilapia, a whole loaf of garlic bread with potatoes shrimp and green peppers.  Price and portion is on point!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic feel & food! This place was packed when we went but thankfully we had reservations. Our group had about 14-16 people & the staff was very accommodating. The staff is all bilingual from what I encountered & everyone was extremely friendly.   The food here is incredible! My boyfriend & I got a platter of seafood, grilled veggies, potatoes & it came with an entire loaf of garlic bread. It was $35 & well worth it because it could have fed another couple; huge portion. The calamari & octopus were delicious. We had shrimp empanadas that were crispy & full of flavor. Looking at the tables around us this place is all about large portions & great food.   This is a place that keeps you coming back! I understand why there's always a line waiting to get inside. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh and delicious! So much food and reasonably priced. Service was great and very attentive. A definite must for locals and worth the drive for those wanted to escape the strip."}
{"text":"Oh man! This place is pretty intense. I loved it!   You can't miss this place! The music is ridiculously loud inside the restaurant and outside! A bit too loud outside I had to raise my voice to hear myself, but honestly, that didn't bother me too much.   So we got here 30mins before it closed. (They use to close around 1am) Yes, we were THOSE people. I felt bad, but my \"husband\" asked if we could get the seafood platter. He's been dying to try a place with the seafood platter like in San Pedro, and we finally found a place. The server said she'd check if they were still making hot plates since it was close to closing, and they said yes! YAY! They let us stay, and I definitely appreciated that! Maybe cus we got one of the most expensive plates? Haha.   The servers were all smiles. I love how they all greeted us, and it looked like while we were eating, they had a meeting after they closed. They all still check on us though! Above and beyond!   So this is what we ordered...  -Half Dozen Oysters - They gave us nice oysters. Not the one's with nothing in em. Large and full half shells.   -Tilapia, Shrimp, Calamari platter. We added a Lobster tail!! - All perfectly seasoned, spiced and cooked nicely. Pealing the shrimp was a bit of a mess, but that's the experience too. The vegetables were warm and cooked to perfection. The lobster tail was large and FULL of meat. Tilapia was fried and filling! I will say it's not as fresh as you would get it when we're near the ocean, but it's still very good!  -Extra Garlic bread. (we didn't know it came with the platter) - Warm, buttery goodness!!  -The most heavenly mechilada!! YUM YUM! Before all that we got salsa and chips/crackers.Thumbs up!   Everything was on point! At the end we paid a little bit over $100 and we were ok with that. (cus he paid!! LOL. I'm loved!)   Food gets an A- and customer service gets an A++!"}
{"text":"Very nices dinner  This restaurant is the best Mexican seafood in Vegas  My respect for this owner  Also a nices service. She was very professional and explain about a restaurant history   Her name is marcela  Ohhhh don't forget order a fried ice cream soooo good"}
{"text":"Was ok, the place is very small, dark, I did not like the place!  The piña colada had no liquor. Te scallops was good."}
{"text":"excellent place and food! music and the service are great! I will be back in few weeks"}
{"text":"this has got to be my favorite seafood restaurant. the staff is fantastic very pleasant and very attentive. there was a bit of a wait but sooo worth it."}
{"text":"On food alone this would easily be a 5 star. I had fajitas with combo beef, chicken and shrimp. Everything was so fresh, so tasty! Even the beans and rice were the best I've had. The salsa was bold, spicy and so good. I want to go back and try some of their seafood combo baskets. They looked amazing.  This is a neighborhood hot spot for sure. It was packed on a Thursday night. Our waitress was super nice. Even though I don't speak Spanish she did a good job understanding my requests. Service was a little slow at times but it was pretty busy. Interior was a little lacking but worth it for the great food. And did I mention we had two huge meals and two beers a piece for under $40?"}
{"text":"Superb food and service! Happy atmosphere and busy on a Friday night.  Worth it though!"}
{"text":"A fantastic experience all around. We went for happy hour and enjoyed an enormous amount of food and booze for a great price. Liz, our waitress, was the quintessential excellent hostess and we never wanted for a thing. I recommend the spicy ceviche tostadas, but you can't really go wrong. A diamond of a place that has a lot of charm."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Mexican food, my food was excellent, my drink was really good...they have music singers inside of course if you pay them they sing you a song. I really love this place."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I had the option.  $50 for A nasty ass piece of shit cocktail. Disgusting !"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to vist Las vegas we had always gone to only one spot for some Mariscos and music, this time we decided to come here because some of our family members are regulars here and had told us very good reviews about this place , so we came on Mothers day it wasn't too packed because we got there at 10 am , i ordered A Drink called Piña loca i think it was good i did not add alcohol and my husband ordered a Corona familiar with a michelada just look at the picture i post how big it is ... and to eat I ordered camarones rancheros the beans n rice were bomb and not to mention the side of salad they add to the plate delicious with some bread and the Shrimp were sooo Bomb... the customer service was incredible great our waitress was very talkative and attentive"}
{"text":"Mariscos como me gustan frescos y fríos porciones grandes que valen la pena. . Micheladas bien frías  también y buen sabor. Carla muy amable y nos atendió muy bien. Food was great I will definitely will be coming back. I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"If english is your only language you may think you made a mistake YOU ARE SO WRONG.  Menu is in spanish only and staff speaks little english.  THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS THE FOOD AND  WOW hands down best I have ever had.  I have had spicy shrimp, filets and enchiladas.  Words can not express what magic they do with their sauces."}
{"text":"Mariscos El Puerto makes my favorite Michelada in town the Pacifico (ballena) michelada. Their Tostada Aguacatera is amazing. They have the best service the staff is very friendly and welcoming. Liz went the Extra mile suggestion an off menu item the rib eye steak and it was delicious. She is always fast knowledgeable about the menu and makes very good suggestions her service is second to none."}
{"text":"It's a little difficult for me to give a review on this place, mostly because I don't eat seafood. Why come here then? Well I have my reasons, so I'll try to be fair.   I knew going in that it would be difficult to find something to eat, but I tried. I debated just getting a dessert, but I needed something more substantial. I decided on the pasta Alfredo, it does come with shrimp, but I asked to get it without it. Yes, I had to question a Mexican seafood restaurant in making a pasta dish.... so I did not have any high hopes.  It came out with two pieces of garlic bread, or so it looked like garlic bread. The dish appeared to look normal, but after closer inspection, something just didn't look right. I took a bite, the sauce is creamy, but it didn't have much flavor. It also had a garnish on top, but I noticed it was cilantro. Also, there were onions... apparently an entire one for that matter... And also green bell peppers. When I saw this, I was shocked but also not shocked, because I was anticipating something unique. This place kinda ruined Pasta and Alfredo sauce and onions for me, and I do like onions, just not in this dish.  The service however was very good, even though it was pretty busy on a Saturday night. I'm sure this restaurant is great in serving what it is intended to serve - seafood."}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas and I was craving shrimp and a michelada. I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try the wait was probably like 15 minutes really fast and good service and got one of the best waitresses ever MARCELA she was very accommodating and welcoming right away she started telling us what their best dishes were and also what was more convenient for what we were craving. 1 of the best micheladas i had ever tried and their ceviche was delicious and you gotta try the San Pedro tray I will definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Man, this place was great. We woke up Sunday morning looking for some mariscos after a crazy night at the Strip. Thankfully Yelp led me to Mariscos El Puerto for a delicious meal. They had the soccer game when we walked in and mariachi playing. The food was delicious (we ordered the San Pedro platter, the 7 mares soup, and a cocktail). Our waitress, Adriana, was super attentive and very nice. She never batted an eyelash to our requests and she went above and beyond to provide exceptional service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"You've got to try this !!!! The restaurant is rather small so it gets packed! First time here & im glad my husband found it on YELP  Customer was excellent....they & I mean all servers stopped by often to see how every was or if we needed some else. We ordered micheladas to start for drinks! Not all restaurants can make these drinks. I've had bad ones but this place got their ingredients right!! Holy smokes I finished it to the last drop !! For the food seafood is the specialty and I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it Just an FYI....Portions are BIG!! My husband ordered a large CAMPECHANA ..shrimp & octopus and 1 ceviche tostada. Well large was LARGE  I ordered 2 shrimp ceviche tostadas.... I've tried many in my life .... again big portions...These tostadas was fricken aaaaaaaawesome!! I didn't need to add nothing to these tostadas except for of course the Tapatio! I was in heaven! I was only able to eat 1 tostada & took other to go.   Everything was great .... Thanks don't change anything!! Next time we come back to Vegas .... we'll be back"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2014 and I really love the food,always hot and fresh I think it's top 3 in vegas depending on what you are looking for, the prices are less than Islas and the location is great near my neighborhood they also have great discounts during the week, I went in on a Saturday afternoon very pack got seated next to the door it was raining so when people open the door I felt the cold weather so I recommended waiting for better seats lol the customer service was great our waitress keep checking up on us, I order the culichi shrimp instead of beans I got fries and it was on point best green salas ever, my husband order the viejon tacos and it was a disappointment because they had no favor very little cheese and somehow we didn't get the green salas, but I will return and he will order something else lol"}
{"text":"Best Micheladas I've ever tried!!!!!!! The Mixto molcajeta super good! Everything, the mixed tostada the sauce in the molcajete even the salsa and chips!"}
{"text":"My first time here wasn't the best but I've definitely learned to love this place, the food & drinks are amazing. Even on a busy full day all the servers take great care of us, I highly recommend this place it's a MUST"}
{"text":"$20 no flavor shrimp cocktails.. & let's not talk about the cervesas preparadas, tasted like watered down shrimp water with beer. Worst Mariscios in Las Vegas! Service was good!"}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation from a barber at Goodtimes Barbershop and I could not be happier to have gone. The beer was ice cold and the food was delicious and flavorful. Service was awesome. Watch what you order, portions are generous."}
{"text":"We've been to this place about 3 times, and I came to notice that most dishes are mostly vegetables with a little bit of seafood when in reality it should be the other way around in which I receive more seafood than vegetables ."}
{"text":"The seafood is good and the waitress was really friendly and on top of our orders. Hubby ordered the bowl that consisted of a lot of different seafood, but I thought it was too busy and messy. I ordered the shrimp with green gralic sauce and I liked it. My sister order the HUGE shrimp sandwich, she said it could have had more shrimp. Over all we would come back."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso, si te lo recomendó.   This place is really good, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here regrettably the music was super loud. I walked in and no AC and its 110 outside and music blasting wasn't very inviting. There were several dirty tables I sat at a small table with a bar stool and that was uncomfortable plus add the heat No AC and crazy carnival music yeah I lost my appetite for this place-next!"}
{"text":"I this is authentic Mexican food.  I would like to sit in the PATIO but it was so windy we had a sit inside. The only drawback of sitting inside is that loud music  which seems to be a distraction. The service is excellent the place is always full with Mexican and Latinos, which is a good sign. The service is the best. We had shrimp empanadas which comes with a sauce so spicy it should come with a Surgeon General warning. All said and done great place to dine."}
{"text":"San Pedro meets Vegas. While this place is not near the water it definitely pleases the craving for San Pedro style seafood. The micheladas are also delicious. Not giving it 5 stars based on staff. I've been here enough times to say, the staff doesn't really wow me. Once the waitress made a mistake on our tab & when addressed she literally argued with us. But I like the food, so I go back every once in awhile."}
