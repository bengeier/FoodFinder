{"text":"My recent email to JM Customer Service.    Dear JM Customer Service,   I though you should know that Las Vegas Airport Terminal 3 location was quite the disappointment with my visit last night.   I'm a fan of your location in Venice Beach location as they serve your product as it should be. The LV Airport location has disappointed me on two travel occassions. Both times the Tequlia Chicken sausage has had no favor. Also, they serve the sausage on a regular Hotdog size bun that is clearly to small for the sausage. Nothing like the large bun your other locations offer. The optional onions and peppers that they offer are miniscule slivers of dissapointment. Why even offer them? I understand the ridiculious prices of $13.00 for a Sandwich, fries and a soda being in an airport location, and yes the small portion of fries sucked as well. What I don't understand is why you let this location continue to serve such a poor product of yours? If anything, this location should be your flagship store making the best product your brand is know for.   Here's hoping for a change.   MS  Sanger CA     ms"}
{"text":"Horrible awful overpriced food.  The bun was dry and stale,  the tequila chicken dog had only one note of flavor which was smoky like a cigarette - same with the chili cheese fries.  The dog had only the barest few strips of grilled onions and peppers.  Don't make the same mistake I did and assume that the Yelp reviews for the Santa Monica location would apply here."}
{"text":"First of all, please hire people at least willing to try to speak English. Second of all, make your food  somewhere half as good as Wienerschnitzel. The prices are exorbitant even for the airport, which is sad because the food is abysmal. My sausage tasted like something my dog ate out of the litter box, threw up, ate again, then puked into the center of a rancid casing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst polish sausage I have ever had.  The dog is flavorless and the bun is slightly sweet.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs.   Go hungry,  you will be better off."}
