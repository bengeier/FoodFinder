{"text":"This is a very quiet Asian cafe with many asian customers (guessing from the work buildings). I was kind of surprised for a while since this place wasn't on the yelp radar. 

Decor wise - it's has a lot of light elements with some patio furniture inside. 5/5

Staff were quick and helpful. 5/5

Food wise - I got the xiao guo noodle soup served in copper pot. A lots of minced pork with the pickled cabbage. It was similar to other places serving guilin noodles in Markham. The weird aspect was that the food was served in grey plastic trays with plastic utensils. I would have just gone the distance and upgraded that part. 

Quick for lunch and everywhere is instagramable

PS - they do have wifi as well"}
{"text":"Two stars for the atmosphere. Food weren't appealing and pricey. Service was slow and not attentive at all. Asked for water never came. Ordered popcorn chicken and there were only 8 pieces."}
{"text":"Miss Lin cafe is where Serissa café previously located, and it can be spotted on hwy 7.  This cafe is lovely and it's surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows.  The nature lights plus the patio furniture make this place very inviting. Stepping inside the restaurant seems like stepping outside in a patio.  5 stars for the décor and ambiance.  But 2 stars for both service and food.  Service is slow and inattentive.  Food came in a plastic grey tray with Styrofoam plate and small plastic teaspoon; stars deducted right away.  We had stewed chicken with rice, eel with rice, stewed beef with noodle, grapefruit green tea and barley drink.  The noodle in soup was served in a copper pot, which was nice.  But all the food were luke warm.  I'm wondering how long had the food been sitting around before they were served.  The worst dish of the day was the chicken; it was overcooked and dry.  The best dish was the stewed beef noodle; the meat was tender.  But it's luke warm and didn't smell delicious.  Both grapefruit green tea and barley drink were good.  4 stars for the drinks.  If I would be back again, I'd just have a drink and enjoy the relax atmosphere."}
