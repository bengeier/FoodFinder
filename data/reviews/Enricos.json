{"text":"Went for an early dinner with a work friend - we usually get together once a week and like to enjoy a casual meal to catch up.  We were the first ones in so we were seated promptly and our waitress greeted right away.  We explained we were first timers and needed time.  She started to tell us about the specials - my friend said we weren't to that point yet - well she didn't know if we were in a time crunch and calzones took 20 mins.  This wasn't at lunch time so we said not a problem we just wanted to enjoy dinner.  She took our drink order than came back and explained they had changed their Coke Zero on their machine for Fruit Punch - hmmmm....so they are catering more to the kids instead of adults but are expanding into craft beers?
The spinach/crab appetizer needed to taste like it actually 
had some crab.  Plus needs to be served with smaller pieces of bread or pita chips.
The wedding soup was good according to my Italian friend but the pasta fagoili reminded me of navy bean soup - that was disappointing.
My chicken parm was good unfortunately I ordered veal parm.  We were busy talking and I was several bites in till I noticed.  When I asked our waitress she was adamant that I had said chicken not veal. My friend had clearly heard me order the veal because we had discussed it prior to ordering.  Now keep in mind I wasn't asking for another order or a discount- but she said that she had written it down as chicken so that's what I had said.  Really - going to argue and take a stand? That always gets you a big tip!  My friend had a shrimp pasta dish - said was ok but nothing exceptional- as I said she is Italian and likes authentic.

The staff was nice but we had trouble having a conversation because of the constant interruptions from our waitress- guessing she didn't have many tables.  It actually got to the point of being annoying.  In addition our waitress was very compulsive about clearing dishes - even when we weren't finished.  Perhaps if there was more spacing between each dish that wouldn't be a problem.

Read previous review about atmosphere more like a bar or tap house and I have to agree after eating there.  

Not bad experience but more so so.  Hope they continue to improve as it's nice to have more options in the area.  Only time will tell."}
{"text":"so excited to have this place in the neighborhood. We ordered a margherita pie and some salads to go. The pizza is just as good, if not better than my favorite margherita pie from NJ and that's saying a LOT. I never thought I'd see the day where I'd love pizza in Charlotte- this beats all places by far. it's the real deal. They have pasta dishes, calzones, hot and cold sandwiches, etc. Can't wait to eat my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is as bland as it can be. The sauce they make for their pasta comes directly from a can, same thing with all their vegetables! There is nothing fresh about made here. I gave this place 3 tries and the three times I came I left discussed with the food. It is safe to say that I am  not coming here any more.  

Another thing, I don't know who this guys is, if the manager or owner but he has this angry face thats makes anyone feel uncomfortable and it definitely not welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me keep it short and simple.....
- The decor of the restaurant was very nice. 
- Everything the eye can see was clean.
- Great customer service. We came across a few issues with our order but the waitress did not hesitate on helping us out.
- The food was alright. Really would be nice to have fresh veggies and not those from a can. 

I was kind of looking forward to eating a more authentic/homemade meal.

I would recommend visiting Enrico's for an appetizer and drinks. 

I have been to Papa Sammy's Pizza in Mount Holly, NC and food is way better. The variety of food is not as extensive as the food listed on Enrico's menu but at least many of the food items are homemade and there are many fresh ingredients in their dishes."}
{"text":"Has potential but needs to step it up a bit. Great to have a sit down restaurant in the area. 
Inside was loud- could use something to soften the noise. Patio is a nice addition although the small lawn allowed patrons to let their kids run and shout- not conducive to a grown up quiet dinner.
Server was friendly and attentive and knew the menu.
Bread could have been served with a plate for dipping. Both olive oil and salad dressing were served in cheap plastic tubs- it would be classier and more environmentally friendly to use a nicer reusable bowl.
Shrimp pasta special was amazing!
Veal Saltimbocca was less so. Prosciutto was more like thick Canadian bacon, and the whole thing was covered in a huge gooey wad of bland mozzarella and spinach. Put on a large bed of spaghetti- the whole dish seemed thrown together, and like a tacky version of what could be a tasty Italian favorite.
We will go back for sure, but might stick with local favorites like pizza and pasta. I don't think I would risk disappointment by trying the more traditional Italian trattoria fare.
With some work this can be a real gem!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 5 pm Tuesday. Not crowded. We were greeted at the door and shown to a table by the window.  Two waters, and bread were delivered fast. Our order of large Calzone and two salads was taken. The salads arrived in a few minutes and it was a plate full. All fresh. The Calzone arrived as big as a large pizza! 1/2 went home as lunch for tomorrow.  The sauce and cheese had great flavor. I did not have room for desert. They have a bar and craft beers. So under 35$ and we got 4 meal. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Had your 'za take it for Valentine's Day dinner and it was great! We also got the garlic knots but I'll pass on those next time! I will absolutely be coming back for your pizza. Prices aren't too bad, either!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food, and that's coming from a New Yorker. So surprised to find this place in NC!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, huge portions

My wife and I went here for dinner tonight.  We like trying new restaurants, and I am so glad we gave this one a shot.  The location is convenient and the ambience is great.  It is a tad loud in there because of the concrete floors and all of the glass, but it is not a big deal.

My family previously owned an Italian restaurant so I am picky when it comes to Italian food.  The meal was EXCELLENT!!  The fried calamari appears to be double dredged before being cooked and they were excellent.  I had the Arrabiata and it had so many flavors going on at once, but they all worked great together.  I am not usually even a red sauce fan but theirs was flavorful with just a great hint of spice, and the prosciutto, olives and mushrooms put it over the edge.

My wife had the linguini and clam sauce.  There had to be 15-20 huge clams in the shell in it still (vs. other restaurants that just used canned clams).  It was flavorful and fresh and she can't wait to eat the leftovers because linguini with clam sauce is always better the next day.

Speaking of leftovers....the portions are huge.  We have a full serving of calamari still left, and over half of each of our dinners (which came with soup or salad).  The meal total for the big app, 2 big dinners with soup/salad, 2 beers and a glass of wine was around $60.  GREAT value.  

Can't wait to go back.  A diamond in the rough and the best Italian food we have had in Charlotte (and we have been to many Italian restaurants in town)."}
{"text":"We had the garlic cheese bread, chicken parm sub and Stromboli. Both were excellent. Clean, quick service and large portions all around."}
{"text":"Love it!!! The food the service the atmosphere! Everything is great !!! I highly recommend everyone try it !"}
{"text":"Good italian pasta dishes, good italian pizza slices, excellent vodka sauce and warm tasty non garlic bread with real butter.  Sandwich comes with huge side of fries and the have generous bowls of soup, with daily soup specials.  Nice spot, good service."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times now and we love it! Very good little Italian place. Little disappointed that the menu got changed, I get the sandwich and they took the fries off as the included side and are just doing a bag of lays chips now! My fianc√© got the shrimp scampi and it was a decent size and had excellent flavor, wasn't to oily. The tails were left on the shrimp though so you have to detail them before you can eat it. Can't wait to to back and try other things!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and actually seems to gets better every visit we make . Great service, fresh food and good drinks can't ask for much more than that and their prices are very reasonable. Definitely in the top 5 best  Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! Prices were incredibly reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great, the service is great and this is just what the area needed. There is fast food all over so it's nice to have a bit of a nicer sit down place. Everything I have had there I have enjoyed, gnocchi, pizza, salad, and the garlic knots are awesome. I highly recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"This was a nice little Italian place. 

I'd had a craving for Italian and decided to give this place a try. The menu is pretty extensive, most of your common dishes with some surprises. 

I started with an order of calamari. They were good. No complaints, but the marinara sauce that comes with it was delicious. It's so good you'll want a bowl of it by itself. They also bring out rolls to start the meal. I wish they would have been warm or another type of bread better for dipping.  

For dinner I ordered the chicken parm. It was classic. The chicken was nice a crispy and then topped with sauce an cheese. I also added a side of meatballs - the order comes with three and these were definitely the star of the evening. They packed so much flavor! And they tasted even better on the second day. #winning

Overall, this is a pretty solid place. I look forward to coming back, there were a few dishes that I saw come out the kitchen that I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love having a independently owned restaurant (not a chain) right here in Berewick.  There isn't anything I have ordered yet that I don't love with leftovers to take home.  But let me just say...their garlic knots-best I've ever had.  Great little snack to pick up on the way home.  Staff is so nice.  I hope they succeed!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Hugh portions and so good!  Wife and I had 2 dinners, 2 glasses of wine ...$43 bucks!  Please, please come open up a 2nd location in Lake Wylie !"}
{"text":"Chad and the entire staff is amazing!!! The owner his self is fabulous! So great to have this establishment in our neighborhood!! Love love!!!"}
{"text":"I arrived from out of state and needed a nice place to eat. This place was wonderful quality and the place was extremely clean. You will not be disappointed. It is reasonably priced and the service was very good. I would come back here in a heartbeat.  I could not be more pleased."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the service because we have only ever ordered to go (we live 2 mins down the road). However, I am so thankful to have a place close by that is actually worth the money. It's very hard for a lot of southern restaurants to impress me (I'm from NY and I came from a straight off the boat Italian family)- but Enricos really impressed me big time. The sauce is perfect! The bread is fresh and actually quite delicious."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the wine, the shrimp primavera, and the salad. Portion sizes were plenty for me to pack for lunch the next day. Wonderful to have this in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Carolinas. I've been here a few times and I absolutely love it. The owners are fabulous and the food is very good. I would definitely recommend this place. It's good for family and parties."}
{"text":"We ordered a Chicken limonatta - chicken wasn't cooked well, veg lasagna instead of the layered dish was spread out and tasteless, eggplant parmigiana had a strange taste. Overall the oil used wasn't great quality. Left an after taste."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to dine at Enrico's for some time but finally visited recently.  The restaurant exterior is beautiful, the interior is simple and charming, and the patio is small but attractive.  I dined outside on the patio.

The menu has plenty of selections but none that really jumped out me.  I wanted mussels but it is served with a red sauce, when asked, the kitchen said they could use a garlic and lemon sauce instead which was appealing.  The pizza sizes were too large for a single diner so I opted to forego that.  The calzone and stromboli were appealing but I did not like the price point.  The shrimp scampi appetizer seemed amazing but the entr√©e size had different ingredients that did not appeal to me.  However, the party seated next to me were served spaghetti that looked good and smelled incredible.  Ultimately, I selected the shrimp appetizer but has an entr√©e size with a Caesar salad and cup of hot water.  

I had to request silverware and received a black cloth napkin which I liked.  However, when I unraveled the napkin, it had hair and crumbs on it.  The replacement was utensils wrapped in a paper napkin, which was ok but I preferred a clean fresh smelling black cloth napkin.  I received the cup of water, inserted a tea bag but it never steeped.  When I checked the water is was lukewarm and lipstick was on the cup.  When I was finally able to reach my service I asked for very hot water in a clean cup.  

I receive the Caesar salad but the dressing had an overwhelming taste of mayo that I did not care for.  Also, it did not have croutons and I really wish they were included.  I received my entr√©e while I was still eating the salad.  I wish many restaurants did a better job of timing the courses.  After finishing the salad, I moved to the entr√©e of shrimp scampi.  When I tell you it was a gorgeous dish, believe me.  The fettucine pasta was light, the sauce was plentiful with lots of flavor, the shrimp were big and beautiful; I could not have asked for more.  Also, the entr√©e was served with warm rolls and butter.  I was in heaven and savored every bite.

Although I loved my entr√©e, I gave the restaurant 4 out of 5 stars because my server.  The server was not attentive, it seemed as though I was a bother to her, at the end of my dinner a different server came to me to say my initial server had an emergency and left which was fine because she wasn't of much help to me.  The deduction of one star is also because of the salad dressing, dirty napkin, unclean cup, and lukewarm water.

Will return to Enrico's, heck yeah.  Do I recommend Enrico's to others, definitely."}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant!  Great service and great food.  The baked ziti was awesome."}
{"text":"Be careful when go in this place they change there menu and there prices like the stock mart .. Food is just average..no effort in being consistent ..I tried to support this place because I leave in the area.. but when you show no love you get none.. they'll be out of business soon with this type of operation.."}
{"text":"Gnocchi!...all you need to know. Trust me, Terry J knows. Love this place. The bald guy that is always there is very personable and one heck of a cook."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since they opened. I've heard some many mixed opinions about their food that I had to check them out.
My friend and I decided to come for lunch on a Friday. We got there around 12:20pm and the restaurant wasn't too busy.
We decided to sit on the outside area that was pretty nice. I chose the gnocchi and my friend the crab dip.
Gnocchi is one of my favorites kind of foods so I had  to try theirs.
The gnocchi was hard and the sauce was acidity was way too much besides there was a hair in my food.
The food my friend ordered she liked it and I tried and it was good too. When I was almost done with my meal the waitress came with my bread that she was supposed to bring with my gnocchi.
I didn't even wasted my time complaining about the hair in my meal because wasn't worth it.  As a matter of fact nothing was worth it in this visit.
This is one of the few places I will never go back to."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a lunch meeting & I was glad i did! I had the lasagna and it was hands down the best I have ever had! I'm not a big lasagna but this was the bomb! Flavorful & well portioned! My fr md had the Stromboli. He said it was good, but the bread was cooked hard otherwise it would have been a 5 star.
Service was friendly & very prompt."}
{"text":"Love Enrico's. This place is probably the most legit pizza place in Charlotte, especially in the steel creek area. I have eaten here a couple times, but normally stick to take out. My family has tried the pizza (pepperoni), Stromboli (regular), and wings (blackened and texmex). We love that their wings are nice and crispy and so flavorful! And the Stromboli is oozing with deliciousness . The pizza is very good as well. They put the right amount of sauce and I like that the pepperoni is made of beef and not pork. If they keep up with the quality that I've seen so far, I'm sure this place will remain/ become a staple for many others."}
{"text":"Enrico's just opened in the Berewick Town Center. I am so happy to finally have a sit down restaurant that isn't a fast food joint. My waiter today was Jesus, he was amazing and very helpful when recommending something to try. In regards to the soup of the day I went with his recommendation for the creamy chicken soup with garlic. The soup was amazing, very flavorful in a nice creamy sauce. As far as the entree, I went with alfredo with chicken. With the entree comes a salad fyi. In regards to the alfredo, initially it came out a bit too soupy for me, but I requested that the sauce be made thicker and when it came back out it was 100% better. They have such a large menu, I will definitely  be back to try other options, I know there is something I will fall in love with. The menu includes, pasta, pizza, calzones, plenty of appetizer choices as well as dessert. There is also a kids menu. They will also have some type of bar, not sure if they have a liquor license but they were stocking bottles of wine while I was there today."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!! Great Service!! Great wine and beer on tap! I've have lunch and dinner here many times since the summer. Highly recommend you take the time to relax here for a good meal and nice atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time dining in. First time my husband and I ordered lasagna and baked ziti; we usually don't eat these dishes so it was hard to gauge how tasty it was...I would say it was good, not bad and not the best. Service was slow however they had just opened that weekend so pass there. 

This time i ordered linguine in white clam sauce...LOVED it, could've used more pasta though was my only complaint. The clams and sauce were delicious. Got a Manhattan clam chowder with it...SO good with plentiful clams. (I was feeling clammy). Husband got a pizza; he didn't like it- sauce and dough were not how he likes his pizza. My brother got a Philly cheesesteak with fries, he said it wasn't bad however not the best. service was attentive however got slow at the end when it came to paying/waiting for card back which can be bothersome especially when you're full and ready to go. I will definitely be back to taste other items on the menu...still thinking about the clam sauce!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The marinara sauce is the best in the world! Good enough to eat with a spoon. The service is friendly and prompt and this place has that genuine, fresh food feel. Definitely try Enricos! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great fast/casual Italian restaurant near the outlets. Having just moved out near the lake, there were a number of times when a quick pizza, veal parm, chicken piccata, or the stromboli sounded like a good dinner option.

The food has always been good. Decent portions at the right price. The bread and pizza dough is delicious. The red sauce cane be a little thin, more so just with the pasta. The fettuccini Alfredo is also good, but a little light on the sauce. Regardless, it's my go to for a quick take out dinner and occasionally a quick sit down dinner.

The decor is modern minimalist (lots of grays, lots of wood, lots of gray wood).

The bar area is small but they have excellent bartenders and are well stocked. A small but solid wine and beer list.

This will continue to be a regular pick for midweek take out!"}
{"text":"We have been twice and really liked it... we just stopped for appetizers and a glass of wine both times, so we especially like it now that they have their ABC license and will be stocking a full bar. 

The first time we sat outside and the patio is very comfy and last night we sat at the bar with Chad and he took extra wonderful care of us. Maria, the manager, also checked on us throughout both meals to make sure we enjoyed everything. The pizza was pretty delicious, especially the cheese, and it was fun to watch the owner and the other chef making pizzas and other goodies. The marinara is yummy for the garlic knots and I realllllly loved the shrimp scampi. I really want that over some angel hair pasta next time! Or the chicken parm, which I was eyeing at the neighboring table and looked deeelish! 

We don't have kids, but it is family friendly for those who do."}
{"text":"I can't get over how nice the staff is. The food and atmosphere are great too! We have been here 4 times already and it's always consistent. I highly recommend this place! It's a welcomed, much needed addition to this area."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant trying this new restaurant in its first week of opening, but we had a very good experience.
The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in, and sat us right down. Three different people asked if we needed anything while we waited for our dinner. The food was very tasty.  We will definitely go back and try more of their menu"}
{"text":"Caught this place by surprise. Looks brand new decided to give it a try.  Very happy I did.  Food was awesome service was excellent. I had clams scampi as an appetizer and penne bolognaise.  Just terrific. Best of luck."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight!  I had a pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and it was delicious!  My husband had a Stromboli which he also enjoyed. However, he did mention that he had to eat through quite a bit of crust before he got to the toppings.  The service was very good and the prices are reasonable.  We are looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Decent little Italian place in the quickly developing area by the outlets, but the atmosphere is too fast-casual for the more extensive menu. 

Similar to many other strip mall Italian restaurants where you see pizza options displayed when you walk in, the minimalist decor and lack of sound absorption made this a bit louder and less comfortable than expected. 

An $8 10\" vegetarian pizza was chock full of toppings and the crust had a nice crispness on the bottom, so a good value. The pasta dish we ordered was tasty and filling for $13. Bread and salad were run of the mill and unfortunately the service was a bit lacking, as we had to ask three time for our drinks (water), which were finally brought out with the food. 

Nothing outstanding about this place good or bad, it just seems to blend into the background when considering the variety and quality of culinary options around the metro area. Could be good for families or groups and the small patio could be nice in the warmer months. Local beers represented on tap."}
{"text":"Best Stromboli!!  And pizza is good Especially for the south and I'm from the north where pizza is king.  I bet after some time when the ovens get seasoned it will be"}
{"text":"Great addition to the growing Berewick area.  The pizza and pasta both are delicious. Love having somewhere I can either dine in or out near by. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday 
Every thing was excellent
Food and Prices are very very good
Sunday afternoon was crowded
Good vibe and nice  atmosphere
Will go back often"}
{"text":"Went middle of day.  Had chick parm and veal parm entrees.  Excellent flavor.  Sauce was very tasty.  Big portions.  Rolls made in house.  Service very nice.  Good location.  Only other Italian I go to is Mama Ricotta and that's a drive in traffic from Lake Wylie.  This will be my new go to.  Please keep up the service and food.  Don't let it slide.   Please.  Can't wait to try pizza next.
Read Nora Gs review.  Sounds to me like it's a promo review for Sammy's."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try Enrico's tonight, after hearing mixed reviews first-hand from a coworker.   I ordered the Sorrento Pasta opting for penne and added chicken.  The menu pictured on yelp describes that dish as \"saut√©ed fresh tomatoes with garlic with our fresh melted mozzarella.\" What I got was a pureed tomato sauce over penne and bland chicken that tasted like it was pre-made hours ago. I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for a meal like this in a mall food court or family diner, but to be charged $17 for this and store bought bread is a rip-off. Maybe they focus all their energy on their pizzas....."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my wife and 21 mo old sold, staff was great, food was fantastic, we all LOVED our pasta. Service was great and the food came very quickly. Prices are fantastic for great Italian food, will be coming back again as there where ALOT of other things in the menu that we wanted to try"}
{"text":"Have to say I was impressed.  Good food is this area is hard to find so I wasn't expecting it to be that good. We had the spinach dip, a pasta and a pizza. Everything was tasty and service was good!"}
{"text":"Great food and large portions...u won't go hungry.  REALLY good service.  They make sure everything is good and check up on you.  Good Tap  selection.  Our server Fernando was really good.  Will visit again when back from Cincinnati, OH."}
{"text":"OMGASSSHHH. The food is amazing. I ordered the tortellini alfredo and added chicken with a side salad. The meat was tender, the pasta was perfectly cooked and the salad dressing tastes homemade. I had bite squad delivery and they were able to bring my food fast because Enricos had it prepared quickly. I love authentic Italian food being raised up north, this place might be my go to. I cannot wait to order more!!!"}
{"text":"The food was spectacular, at least what I had. Only one minor complaint. It's incredibly loud in the place when everyone gets to talking, however, once you get your food, you forget all about it."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday, Tina was my waitress, very good, had been waiting for them to open, had Bolognese spaghetti, very good and a lot of food, the salad was also good, had lemon pepper dressing (which I had never had before) that they make there, a large menu, lots of things to try....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and was seated back I the corner next to a wine fridge. The layout of the place is odd. It's like it's a pop up restaurant and they just scattered tables around the room. It needs a wall or something separating the dining area. There are a few pictures of Italy but the environment seems quite sterile compared to most Italian places I've been in.

There's full bar in the back as well and a counter where I assume can get take out orders.

The menu is broad and includes Italian specialties, pizza and sandwiches. I was craving a cheesesteak and went with that and added marinara sauce to o it.

When it came out, the sandwich looked promising. The roll was soft and may have been homemade. The meat was cut up well and provolone was melted on top of the meat. Onions on the bottom and marinara on top of the cheese. 

The onions could have been cooked longer as they were still raw. I prefer my onions to be carmelized and these were slightly steamed. The meat was lacking something...maybe salt and pepper. Sauce was good but there needed to be more cheese. It was an Ok sandwich but not close to anything you find near Philly. 

I'd like to come back and try some of their other options but the sterile environment may keep me away. I think there are better, more comfortable places around Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went on a whim and were amazed! Spectacular service! We absolutely enjoyed everything about our dining experience including the Chianti recommended by the bartender, calamari, Pasta, balsamic dressing and hot bread! The portions were enough to share and the pricing was affordable- especially when you can share! Great family and or date night with indoor and outdoor seating. We will drive back from Belmont to enjoy this Italian delight!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and welcoming!. The workers are very down-to-earth and the food is amazing. I ate the calamari for an app and as an entree i ate the blackened chicken broccoli penne pasta alfredo which is to die for! Please visit this restuarant you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out several times and overall happy to have a local restaurant here. I got the vodka pasta and it was  good but they are inconsistent. Tastes different each time and had the pasta not cooked all the way once. The bread was fresh, sauce was tasty and meatballs were good and tender but lacked flavor. The Wedding soup I was not a fan of. Second time we got the Sicilian pizza. It was good my only two complaints are there was not enough sauce and it tasted a little salty. We have gotten the regular pizza and same issue super salty. I've decided won't order the pizza again. Husband had the calazone which large is a full pizza, it's huge! It's good but again nothing outstanding. I will use for last minute dinner ideas but it's an average restaurant. Though their cannolis are bomb!"}
{"text":"The Italian foodie food snob is here to say: four stars!!  Whoohoo!  A good place for Italian food in Charlotte-rare and hard to come by, because the south is not where it's at for Italian food.  

I came on a Saturday night and it was steady, but not crowded.  We were sat and greeted right away.  The service was meh...the waiter seemed a little out of it and slow.  He got a few things on our order wrong, which was slightly annoying, but tolerable.  

I ordered eggplant parm and meatballs.  It comes with bread and a side salad.  Also we tried the calamari for an appetizer.  The calamari was good, the marinara for dipping was up to my standards and even had chunks of garlic in it.  I really enjoyed the marinara further on my main dish.  The flavor is perfect.  The eggplant was nice and cheesy, fresh and hot.  The pasta was cooked well.  I am a big fan of the meatballs, they were delish!  The salad and the bread weren't bad.  The bread was a little dry.    

Overall a good experience and I liked the food a lot."}
{"text":"I really expected more wirh the reviews....the waiter was awesome and the stars are for his attentive service. ...bravo.

The food....well....pasta rule #1 salt the water or its like eating paste....the vodka sauce was fair...the Penne special was bland to the point i used half of the grated cheese from table shaker...and added salt and pepper and red pepper so it was ok.....
Tiramisu claimed to be homemade but there was a distinct \"old fridge\" taste that may haunt me for awhile....it was not well put together lacking in the lady fingers soaked in coffee (or coffee liquor) and surely no mascapone either.

Steer clear if your palate is beyond chain food fare...."}
{"text":"Service iffy but food was great worth the portion 
Would like to see more on menu but overall I would recommend"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before shopping at the outlets, and it exceeded our expectations (even after reading the great reviews)! The cheese bread and pizza were delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere was the perfect blend of classy and casual. We will certainly be back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"For Steele Creek, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I am pretty underwhelmed by the Italian restaurants in Charlotte. Mama Ricotta's is outstanding, but I have yet to find another Italian restaurant I would say is even above average. 

The decor has a nice modern rustic feel to it. There was no wait and only a handful of people there when we went. The service was fast and friendly. 

You get a ton of food. You start with bread, which I thought was pretty good. All of the pasta dishes come with a side salad. They used a spring mix which I'm always a fan of and the balsamic vinaigrette was very good. The portions of the pasta dishes are huge. It would definitely make sense to split them between two people. We got the penne vodka and the gnocchi. Both were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were outstanding, but good solid pasta dishes. My friend got the Sorrento and it was very fresh and pretty good as well.  We finished with the seasonal sweet potato maple cheesecake which was delicious!

This isn't a place I would rave about, but it was definitely enjoyable and raises the bar for restaurants in Steele Creek and Italian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here! I tried a beer from tap then another bottled. Both were new IPA's to me! An IPA from Green Man Brewery out of Asheville was on tap and FCA IPA bottled from Railhouse Brewery out of Aberdeen! I liked the Green Man best! We ordered the Crab and Spinach Dip for an appetizer. It came with garlic bread. In my opinion, it was a tad too soupy but the flavor was good. Not much crab or spinach though. I ordered Gnocchi and my daughter ordered Alfredo. Both were excellent with plenty to bring home. We ordered three cannolis to go and they were awesome! We sat at the bar and service could not have been any better! Next time I'm at the Charlotte Premium Outlets, I'll definitely stop by to eat and drink again. I highly recommend this place before or after shopping!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Pizza and Stromboli were awesome. We are from up north and have not had good pizza since we move to Charlotte a year ago. Pleasantly surprised at how good it was! By far the best pizza we've had since being here."}
{"text":"Totally craving pizza with the girls and we got what we wanted! Popping boboas was a bonus! #win"}
{"text":"Good Italian food and pizza. The white pizza is so yummy and I like their pasta dishes always get the Caesar salad and it's yummy"}
{"text":"My family like to try new restaurants. The food was great. Prices very good. My kid really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the FOOD. I was able to get a wonderful pink sauce, yum! Will definitely return. The shrimp bisque soup is excellent!"}
{"text":"Trying out the new Italian place close to home. Decided to go with the antipasto and a pizza. The antipasto was delish!!! Definitely get it. The pizza was good... the dough was more bready than chewy. I prefer chewy - like back home in NY. 
Next visit will be to try out some entrees."}
{"text":"As the garlic rests on my tongue all I can say is YUM. 

Baked ziti was huge! Enough for me to eat on for two days. I wasn't expecting that. The cheese bread was lightly melted mozzarella with bites of real garlic on cut up Italian bread and served with a marinara that was made for dipping this. This marinara had a different taste than the baked ziti sauce. This impresses me because that is attention to detail. 

Different dishes have different flavor filled sauces. This is important when ordering Italian dishes. 

I ordered from UberEats. Thank you for delivery! I'm in my 18-wheeler so unique places other than pizza that deliver is always welcomed because I can't drive to many of these restaurants in that big ol body."}
{"text":"I have been searching high and low to find an italian spot on my side of town to replace house of pizza who in my opinion has the best lasagna dinner!!! Everything from the bread on down. I was just a little dis appointed that i still have not found that here at Enricos! The customer service here is definetly top notch the lasagna was ok but nothing to brag about i was expecting to have the loaf buttery garlic bread when instead the lasagna dinner came with  italian rolls and butter, i will say their bar area inside of this place definetly stands out and i would frequent this spot for a glass of wine or so, i want to come back here and try the crab and spinach dip appetizer. With all of that being said i am still on a hunt to find a great italian spot that i will be head over heels for ! Arrivederci for now ."}
{"text":"I see a lot of 4 and 5 star ratings for this restaurant. While this is a fine place to eat, it doesn't stand out. The first thing I noticed was the interior has some nice design to it, but the floor is tile and that makes the sound level in the restaurant pretty high. I felt like this would be a great brewery or tap room, not a sit down restaurant. The loudness was probably the most distinctive thing about my meal.
Since they recently opened, they only had 4 red wine options and 2 beers (no draft). The waitress said they were soon to get 3 local craft beers. Hopefully that happens, because a place without a local craft beer option, is off the list. 
We were seated promptly when we arrived. There was no wait line.
We had immediate service. That was good.
They have a decent selection of appetizers, the waitress recommended Calamari, so we had that. The Calamari was typical, not outstanding, not a lot of flavor, but also not fried to death, so it was A-ok. (3 stars)
We had a bottle of wine, selected from the 4 options. It was fine.
Next to the menu! They had a large selection of dishes. Lots of pasta options, pizza, Calzones, Stromboli, and other entrees as well. I had Premivera with Broccoli, mushrooms, Spinach in a cream sauce and I added Meatballs. It was fairly priced and tasted A-ok. It wasn't super tasty. It wasn't really memorable. But not terrible either. Now, it was a YUGE portion. It was easily 4x what I could eat. I always hate going to a place, eating my fill, and then realizing, it looks like I barely touched my main dish. I can't imagine anyone eating a full portion. Similar experience from my family. Portions were very large, quality and taste were A-ok, but not outstanding.
To Dessert! We got a Tiramishu and a cheese cake. Both, again, A-ok.
So, in conclusion. This isn't a bad place, its a fine place, and we need a new place in this area. However, I wouldn't make this a date night location. Its a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is right near my apartment, so came for convenience.

First visit, food was decent, but service was lacking.  Server was more focused on her boyfriend than providing customers good service.

Second visit, found a hair in my food and sent it back.  Soon after, watched bearded owner reach toward his mouth as he walked back to kitchen from pizza area.  Was disgusted.  Hair in food looked like it was from his beard.  Thought entree should have been comped.  Served very apologetic.  Owner couldn't be bothered to come apologize. 

Despite the decent tasting food, won't give this establishment another nickel.  There are far better restaurants with great food and superior customer service worth driving 20 minutes for."}
