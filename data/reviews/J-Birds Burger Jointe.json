{"text":"I like Penny's Place. I believe it's a old school staple in Mint Hill and has been around forever. I'm sure it lives on it's regulars that come in for breakfast and lunch each day - some older men from around town.  From the outside, it looks like it would be very darke, since there aren't really any windows, but it's well lit inside. They have old tin ads and signs posted all over the walls. Pretty quaint. The prices are dirt cheap - literally you can get breakfast or lunch for under $5, but the portions are small and the menu isn't very creative. If you don't want to spend much and have a few extra minutes to spare, this is a good alternative to fast food. I don't think I'd take my kids there, though I'm sure they'd enjoy the signs."}
{"text":"Prior reviews have all commented on the very cool interior wall space of license plates, and tons of signs of a long past era ! The waitstaff was excellent heeding to each customer with a personal touch!
The food was subpar mainly due the amount of grease that came with the burgers etc. I knew I might be in trouble when the burger came out, noticing the sheen left on the plate. Not used to fried foods anymore & I paid for it later that day. Tried the banana pudding for desert, which was average. 
Will go back to taste the breakfast menu, this time I will take some tums prior to chowing down, can't beat the prices, cheap!"}
{"text":"I really wish I had liked the food here better, cause everything else was great. The place is lots of fun to be in and more inviting than it looks like from the outside. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is just a fun experience to be in. 

The prices here are ridiculously cheap, most foods in the range of three dollars. But you get what you pay for, meaning that a salad is some pasty white iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and most other foods are deep-fried and pretty generic. I felt very guilty and not at all healthy after the meal here, and the cooking was definitely not good enough to make the guilt worthwhile. But if cheap and greasy is the kind of food you like, this will be your heaven.

If you want to experience this place, I recommend sticking to the burgers. As far as I know, a Mint Hill cattle farmer supplies the beef to this place. His beef is pastured and (uncertified) organic. The burgers tasted fairly good."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of the original NC Cheeseburger, this is the place. Fresh ground chuck, mustard, slaw, onions and an absolutely outstanding chili. Cooked to order. Approximately 6oz portion that is as good as you will ever taste. Order it with hand breaded onion rings and you are set for the day.
None better in this part of NC, or any part of NC/SC for that matter.

Serving breakfast and lunch, this Mint Hill gathering place will treat you as family and the service is excellent. 5 Star in my book."}
{"text":"Wonderful cheeseburger and fries. Burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since I was born. Great hangout spot for older people who want to talk and have some good food!"}
{"text":"It's ain't the ritz, but that's kinda the point. Great atmosphere, food and a reasonable price tag. Just no caviar."}
{"text":"Cash $ Only  Bring Cash!  Hole-in-the-wall-GREATNESS on Mint Hill!

After reading the yelp review by Chad E. I had to check this place out!  It is a dead giveaway when you walk into this place through the front door everyone will be looking at you because the regulars use the smaller entrance closer to the parking lot!

Signs All over the interior walls - A train and train track suspended from the ceiling!  This place is small (50 seats) and full of Character and when I was here for lunch today it was also full of Characters... It was like something from a movie set!

OK enough about how cool this place is \"how was the food\" hummm the food is harder to review - The way I usually review food is by comparing a similar place or price point - I had a Burger and a BBQ sandwich - Both were about a 3 star prize compared to a burger three times the price and that's not fair, so the food is better than \"fast food\" and was plenty fast and CHEAP so maybe I should say they could be getting more stars, though I'm really barely a fan and wish the food were better, because this is a cool place!  I would go back for Breakfast and check that out!"}
{"text":"Wow, First time I've been there. If it was closer to me I'd be there at least 3-4 a week. It's a small place with a very big attitude. Went for breakfast. Two orders of eggs, country ham, hash browns, homemade biscuits, and drinks for $15. And all cooked to order and very good. Can't wait to go back soon for lunch. Excellent service, all most to good. My tea was never even half empty and it was being refill. Same with coffee. And the food came out fast even though they were busy at the time. If you like local homey places for breakfast or lunch you HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE."}

Is it 1811 or 2011?  Today I went to eat breakfast at Penny's Place. I immediately noticed the lack of \"diversity\".  We were about to be seated when I noticed a \"DuRag\" Hair pack taped to the wall.  There is a picture of a black man on the cover of the pack wearing a \"Du Rag\".  Someone wrote \"Obama\" in black permanent marker,  right above the picture of the black man.  Needless to say, I left immediately and will never go there again!  I took a picture of the building and the picture of the \"Du Rag\" pack.  The owner came out and asked if I got permission from anyone to take the picture of his establishment.  I ignored him.  He told me, \"We don't want your business anyway!\"  Can you say RACIST!!!!!!!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very good service. Food was cooked fast and was hot and fresh. Food was delicious and inexpensive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I know there is a new owner here; he was very pleasant, asking everyone if everything was okay. I'll give them some time to get things into a 'groove.' 

However...Penny's owner, I hope you're reading this...there are only three things on the menu, hotdogs, hamburgers and some sort of shrimp thing. If you only have three things on the menu, and there were only two people in my party...the meals should have been served together. My son got his hotdog 10 minutes before I got my hamburger. And seeing as how much time I had to look around, this was the situation for every single table around me. One person would be served a VERY long time before the others in their party.

Here's my recommendation: write the entire table's order on one ticket. Your kitchen is apparently not noticing which meals are seated at the same table, and are just cooking in an arbitrary order. My poor son, being polite, ate a cold hotdog even though I tried to get him to eat before me.

Also, drain your onion rings...way too greasy.

That being said, though, the hotdog and hamburger were quite good. I would consider this in the future for a quick lunch...but you've got to figure out a way I'll be able to eat with my companion first."}
{"text":"Three of us ate breakfast there this morning, and were served tasteless, reheated packaged food on styrofoam plates.  STYROFOAM plates!  The decor is cute, but  the food is a total waste of money.  We will never go back - and we live less than ten minutes away."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in your greeted by everyone. I could only imagine walking back in time. The servers were on top of everything and very pleasant. The food is good but nothing life. altering. The prices were very cheap. Parking is a little tricking. All in all we will be back!"}
{"text":"Most people do not look at small, unobtrusive cinder block buildings as attractive locations for restaurants.  Dive bars, porn shops, other places you might not want people to see into from the outside, yes.  But restaurants?  Generally they are fairly well-lit and you have windows.  Not Penny's.

This little hole-in-the-wall in Mint Hill (not South Park, as the map would suggest) is a bit of a puzzle.  For starters, the building does not match up to the service in any way.  Walk inside and you will see what I mean.  You are greeted warmly and welcomed like one of the family.  Maybe better than many families.

Beyond that, I really could not tell you when they are open.  I think they are open for breakfast and lunch most days.  But since it is so hard to tell when they are open because of that little building, I have to go by the number of cars outside.  You need to figure out how to park there, too, since there is not much in the way of a lot - it might be easier to park elsewhere and walk across the street.

Should you manage to get there, the service is excellent (excepting the paper plates - that is a minor inconvenience) and the food is solid all around."}
{"text":"A burger, fries, and a side salad. That's not much to ask for. Yet in this case the \"side salad\" consisted of a bowl of lettuce. I asked for oil and vinegar and received white vinegar (for those who don't know...that's not the kind you put on a salad). The burger was clearly a frozen patty, small and unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Friendly staff and food was fast and great. Had a hamburger and hotdog all they way. Mustard chili slaw and onions. Slaw is an option but was worth the add on. Chili is homemade with a little spice and is fantastic. The owner stuck his head out several times to make sure everything was fine."}
{"text":"First timer...but I'll be back...excellent food...very friendly...loved the character if the place."}
{"text":"The place was clean.  Didn't feel welcome, poor service.  Never got silverware.  The  shrimp burger was mediocre at best.  Noticed on sign leaving they had grilled shrimp, was never asked grilled or fried.  Came with coleslaw on it but that was not detailed on the menu.  Cheeseburger was okay.  Menu had burgers, hot dog and shrimp burger and a list of sides.  Overpriced for limited selection and quality."}
