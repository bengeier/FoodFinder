{"text":"Good place to enjoy a good coffee or some baked goods. I really like it and recomend to everyone."}
{"text":"The Lakeshore location is terrific but we go to the new Mississauga location on Ogden Avenue, in the middle of a residential area.  Great coffee- amazing- worth skipping the drive thru of local competitors. Really appreciate the extended hours now 7-7 weekdays."}
{"text":"I've been on the look out for a good coffee place in Etobicoke. A friend recommended this place and I was glad to say the coffee was great! I didn't eat anything there but it looked delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice independent coffee shop with fair trade and organic coffee. I'm pretty sure they started as just a farmer's market stand and now have the store due to the success.

There is a really good selection, and they are considerate right down to the details - even the sugar/milk/cream are 'organic' and they use recycled everything (to the point of offering washable metal spoons).

The music is always great, but if you don't come at the right time of day you'll never find a seat. Expect to pay around the same prices as Starbucks but you'll feel like you have way more choices."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of Fairgrounds. They recently increased their prices. They are overpriced compared to their competition. For example, I can get a latte one size bigger at Whole Foods in Yorkville for less than Fairgrounds. Both are organic. I'm sure rent in yorkville is much higher than fairgrounds area. Roncy cafes are cheaper. Even Pucetaries in Saks is less. Makes no sense."}
{"text":"Quaint neighbourhood coffee shop in the Long Branch area.  Many locals stop in. This area on Lakeshore West is in a slow state of transition so there are many hidden gems to discover and enjoy.

The space is on the smaller side but there was plenty of seating.  Baked goods are reasonably priced and made on premises.  I enjoyed their medium roast coffee very much.  It has a welcoming vibe and I think I'll come back."}
{"text":"I have visited this place since it opened and can tell you that the coffee is absolutely superb! The flavor is so full and rich coupled with a smoothness that is unparalleled. I also have enjoyed the baked goods with much delight. The muffins were fresh, moist and tasty with many flavors to choose from.

I enjoy the atmosphere as it is very relaxed and welcoming. The free WIFI is awesome too! My favorite time to go is on Friday afternoons.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The coffee is terrific at fairgrounds. And the boylan cola is to die for, and best of all the WiFi is amazing here"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is very cute on the inside and is in an easy location
Had gone hear for coffee and scones, the coffee was alright but the blueberry and raspberry scone were very good. Although they needed to be warmed up!"}
{"text":"I go every day! Very happy to see good businesses like this in Long Branch. Coffee is excellent as is atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"Who knew that at the very end of the Lakeshore / Long Branch strip there would be an excellent little independent cafe. Very good latte - not quite Sam James / Dark Horse barista level (where's my perfect foam and latte art!), but very serviceable. Sadly, the tables, chairs and bar were purchased from a closed-down Starbucks, so the place looks a little generic, but the free wi-fi makes up for it. A great local haunt or a place to recover after an exhausting trip to Ikea."}
{"text":"The on site bakery here is terrific. I have used the squares for a number of events including a shower & fundraising.

Be warned the square are so big & rich that I normally cut them into fours."}
{"text":"Was happy to see this place open up in the neighbourghood. Swung by to get some beverages for the road when travelling and both myself and my boyfriend were pleased with the selection. He ordered an iced coffee and enjoyed it. I had the London Fog. 

They have a great selection of organic coffees, and their coffee of the day usually comes with a description, which I found interesting. They also had a wonderful selection of baked goods. I'm dying to go back and try their raspberry and white chocolate scone. 

Atmosphere was cozy. Pretty small area, by has seating inside if you want to stay in and if you're looking to head out, all of their cups and lids are 100% biodegradable. We were pleased and we'll definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"best lattes in the neighbourhood and their muffins are to die for

service is always fast and friendly and welcoming

I love it"}
{"text":"Our experience at Fairgrounds Organic Cafe & Roastery was fairly underwhelming. For sure, they have organic and fair-trade coffee but the two roasts that we tried didn't taste anything special. Moonbean cafe/Pilot roasters remain my go-to choice to buy coffee beans for home."}
{"text":"Would have never known this place existed if I wasn't already going to T.O. Cycle and happened by. This establishment specializes in organic Free-Trade coffee as well as various organic treats like muffins and scones. They roast on site and have a variety of coffees for sale for home brew by the 1/2 or full pound. If your looking for a fresh cup on the spot they offer coffee prepared by common drip, French Press and Vac-Pot. Unfortunately the gal they just hired and was working her first shift as I arrived was not trained to use a French-Press or Vac-Pot. She also seemed unaware where the brewed \"coffee of the day\" was. Hopefully by the time you read this they'll have a properly trained staff member there to assist you when you drop by. 

Thumbs up on the coffee. Comparable quality to places that fresh roast on site like Moonbean Cafe. I also had a pumpkin muffin along with my beverage which was moist  and delicious. Prices are inline with Starbucks but of course you're getting something organic (though \"organic\" I've been told is loosely defined these days). 

The establishment is small and cozy with high ceilings and about 4 small tables with accompanying chairs if memory serves me correctly.  If you happen to be way out on lakeshore blvd. w. and looking for some good coffee I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"I spontaneously visited this coffee shop, because it was near by the laundry I needed to use. Although, there were a lot of other coffee shops options to use instead, I preferred this one, due to the fact that it was the closest one and had wi fi. 
The interior is very ordinary: small tables, chairs, a couple of sofas and a bar side. There is an access to free wi fi and plugs in case you need to charge a cell or a PC. 
In terms of beverages and food, there are several pastry options and a list of organic coffee hot/cold drinks. I tried coffee Americano, added a lil but of honey and milk. As a coffee addicted person, who have tried almost every coffee shop in the city, I may say that this one was one of the best I had. The taste of coffee is so mild, but at the same time saturated and leave amazing aftertaste. 
Although, I don't use this laundry very often, I will definitely find another occasion to come back to this coffee place again."}
{"text":"Nothing worse when you low on caffein craving good coffee and not getting one. Ordered cortado that ended up being espresso shot with some milk in it. Not creamy not foamy nothing cortado-like. Paid almost 5$ for something that is far from what it should be. If i didnt take it to go I would probably return it.

I like their coffee just advise to avoid that cortado"}
{"text":"Fair Grounds Roastery is a great little find. Fun and cheerful barristas with amazing hazelnut lattes! they even have free Wifi!"}
{"text":"Really awesome coffee! I am aficionado of really strong Italian espresso and I was more than satisfied. The price is low and the taste is wonderful!

The roast coffee beans and that's why you can get fresh coffee there!

Unfortunately they are too far from me as I live in north york but nevertheless I'm in love with the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee AND muffins, scones.

Looking for solid coffee and a well made baked good? This place is great. Fresh baked muffins and scones made on premises- carrot muffin and savory cheese scones are my favorites.

Service was on the gloomy side a few months back- def not great to be greeted without a smile in the morning, but its gotten a lot better- most of the time the staff is friendly and a good pick me up with the coffee...a couple of them are still a work in progress.

Overall, I love this neighborhood coffee stop. 

Great lemon squares and Dolly squares when you want a special sweet."}
{"text":"Second location in south Etobicoke is now closed.....just have the one at long branch now."}
{"text":"Whoever the petty owner is should be ashamed subjecting his great staff to no air conditioning in the summer. Too hot on weekends, turn it on cheap skate!"}
{"text":"I worked as a Pastry chef for quite a few years and the baked goods here are AMAZING. I hesitate to rave about the jalapeno cheddar scones because they will sell out before I get there...."}
{"text":"Good and fast service, good coffee. The scones are a bit tough, muffins tasty. We visited 4 times during our trip and always happy. Will come back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Good amount of seating, friendly staff, certified fair trade and organic products - located just east of Port Credit in the Long Branch/Lakeshore West neighbourhood, this place is a decent space to get your coffee fix, to do some work, or to meet up with a small group. WiFi is available (it's their phone number, written down by the stir sticks and napkins), windows are big, lots of natural light. 

First, parking. There's free parking in front of the shop for a maximum time of 1 hour.

Second, the products. Lots of pastries to choose from, and a good amount of drinks on the menu. I ordered a latte and a banana chocolate chip muffin, both of which were just okay to me. The latte was super foamy, I could barely find the latte in the cup. The muffin was also just okay but a bit dry (it wasn't bad, but to be honest, Black Goat Cafe just down the street has better muffins, in my opinion, and also made in house).

The winning point for me here is the space because they have a good amount of it (good spot to get some work done, read the paper, stop by after a morning run, or to meet up with friends), it has a great story (ethical, fair trade product choices), and staff are incredibly friendly. 

I'll definitely be back again to try something else on the menu that I'll hopefully enjoy more - overall, this a place I'd recommend, support, and come back to."}
{"text":"Awesome top quality coffee.  Popped in here while walking around the area and it had a great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Lovely coffee shop with very friendly and warm customer service. In addition to dairy, they also have almond and soy milk and a huge variety of freshly-baked goodies. I forgot to ask if any of them are vegan but I will on my next visit! Also, FREE WiFi :)"}
{"text":"Visited this place after eating at Woody's yesterday.  I love the set-up, the manual bar is a plus, the triple macchiato I got was delicious as was the butter pecan bar.  The only issue I really had was the customer service.  While the girl behind the counter was proficient at her job, she lacked the personality of a good barista.  Very short, and acted almost as if customers were a bother....maybe she needed a break, or some coffee herself to put some pep in her personality.  I will give this place another try next week, hopefully with better results."}
{"text":"This is my go to local coffee joint.  Consistently very tasty fair trade coffee and their pastries are heavenly.  Expect to pay more than your chain coffee spot, but the taste is far superior.

Friendly staff, nice ambience."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe that I haven't written a review of this place since I really liked it the first time I went!  Maybe it's 'cause it was before I started Yelpin'.

Anyway, this is a cute lil' café right at the corner of Lakeshore/Browns Line.  I guess the area's called Long Branch.  And although it's an \"up 'n coming\" 'hood, a scary, ano-druggie lady did still ask me for change as I walked on Lakeshore, so please take note.  A few things are nearby, including Woody's Burgers (haven't tried it) and an Empanada place.

Back to Fairgrounds...

There are less than a dozen tables, so if you're going there with a laptop, hopefully you'll find a spot!  Obvi, free wifi.  Barista was very friendly, chill guy.

Caffeinated drinks are great and are sourced from organic, fair trade beans which they also sell in-store + roast nearby.  Bakery items are from a bakery in the basement of café, so they shouldn't have mysterious ingredients like those at Starbucks.

With places like this 'round, I wonder why people still support the expensive chains??

Tip #1:  Ask for the cost if you're not sure.  Barista almost charged me for foam, but I ordered an iced latté, so n/a.  There were also some flavoured honey sticks right by the cash that I thought were free, nope $0.25/ea.  Another customer in front of me also cancelled her order 'cause she was confused about the cost of beans.

Parking:  There are a coupla spots in front of café, off Lakeshore, around back, and adjacent, on 40th St, the residential street which is right around the corner.  

NO CC!  Cash/Debit only."}
{"text":"Dropped into the cute neighbourhood coffee shop to grab an iced Americano on a hot summer day.  Service was friendly and prompt.  

I believe wifi was available with a password.  I was on the go so I couldn't look into it.

Will have to be back to check out Whisk Bakery located in the basement."}
{"text":"Lattes are by far my caffeinated beverage and this place makes AMAZING Lattes! Ordered a small Hazelnut Latte and just about died! 

I would recommend that if you are staying in you order the small vs the medium as the ceramic cups are virtually the same size.

They also make some pretty yummy looking sandwiches and salads on location."}
{"text":"Fairgrounds Roastery Cafe for sure is cute, ethically correct, friendly, organic and any of those goody goody descriptions you can use to describe it would be appropriate. 

It is always a breath of fresh air to find independent coffee shop out of the downtown core.. and here Fairgrounds even roast their own coffee! 

Super Friendly barista with this big smile makes everyone feel so welcome. Cappuccino was not too bad, but I had better.. It tasted more like a latte..and with too much milk and foam. 

My friend's Matcha Latte for sure was packed with tons of antioxidants as it has so much undissolved matcha powder and it would really help him to cleanse out all the toxins in his body. (just close your eyes and drink up!)

If you want freshly roasted coffee beans, Fairgrounds does carry quite a few different roast.. \"Rich Bastard\" which is one of their house blend dark roast does sounded interesting. There are also certified organic roasted beans from Indonesia, Africa and South America. 

BTW, the dry spaghetti at the counter are not snacks to go with your drinks.. they are used as stirrer. May I suggest Linguine may be a better choice? (damn I just crushed my spaghetti stirrer! and it is cooking in my cappuccino!!!)"}
{"text":"This coffee shop gets four stars from me. They have mugs available for customers who stay. There is also parking in front of the restaurant and behind it, which is a plus in my books. The coffee is good, although I didn't ask about refills. If their washrooms were on the main level I might have given them 5 stars. The ambience was very good. Just enough noise, but not too much."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here yesterday with my boy after an appointment in the area. We are from both Mississauga and know nothing about the Long Branch area. But after my appointment we were on our way back home when we drove by this spot and did a Uturn to see what it was all about. 

We had not yet had coffee/tea or anything to eat for the morning so we were secretly hoping everything from this spot from the coffee to the pastries were going to be amazing. 

My boy ordered a regular latte and I ordered an iced latte made with coconut milk. He really enjoyed his latte. The coffee was really bold and really fresh. Was pretty good. As for my iced latte it was just ok. The coconut milk doesn't give it much of a flavour. I had to add some sugar water (they provide on the bar) to make it a bit sweeter for me. I should have gone with a hot beverage instead. 

We also ordered 2 muffins - 1 carrot and walnut and 1 apple-cranberry. Both muffins were super fresh and really good. 

The space inside is really great too. Probably enough seats for at least 15 people. Although we noticed they didn't have any seating outside. We were looking forward to sipping our coffees outside while eating our muffins. So instead we sat in our car with the windows down. 

Overall we were happy we stopped by to experience this coffee spot. We can't say we would go out of our way to come here but if ever we were in the area we would make an effort."}
{"text":"Ive had their in-house brewed coffee once which was great, but i did pick up a pound of beans to make at home on two occasions. 

Unfortunately, they didnt stack up. Perhaps they are a bit old as it seems they pre-package them and leave on various counters to take home or they use different source of beans for their own brewing, either way you can find better beans at No Frills if thats what you re looking for."}
