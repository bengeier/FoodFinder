{"text":"Great service, awesome food. I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little shop located on Edmonton Trail. Although it offers some seats in the shop, it's mostly designed for take-out. They have an extensive Mediterrnean menu and offer salads, hot items and best of all, Shwarmas. It's definitively worth a visit for a delicious and quick meal."}
{"text":"I love shawarma so I stopped by here to pick up a regular chicken shawarma. Service was quick - it was after lunch hour and as I was waiting for my order, I noticed how dirty the front area was. Maybe these guys are too busy to clean the grubbiness off the  cooler windows, the counters, the till area, the garbage cans. This was more than a few days worth. They do use plastic gloves and seem to keep the prep area reasonably clean. I ordered all the toppings except onions.  Second bite in, I bit something hard - a piece of bone!  A few more bites and some more bone. I finally threw the rest away. I have never had chicken shawarma that contained bone! I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is tasty n fresh.. Service was good
I would recommend if you are in or near downtown.."}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner here the other night, and were not disappointed. I had the veggie plate, which included grape leaves, falafel, humous, tabbouleh, and pita bread. The falafel was a little dry, but still tasty. The humous was standard. The standouts for me was the tabbouleh salad which tasted fresh and flavourful and the grape leaves. And the portion size was very generous - less than $10 and I couldn't finish it.

My bf ordered the chicken shawarma, and though my food was yummy, I was kind of jealous that i didn't order the chicken instead after trying a few bites. 

As mentioned, there is little seating here. a few tables inside  I believe (though when we were there it was scorching inside!) and a table outside. We took ours home to enjoy on our deck instead."}
{"text":"Okay I get it, from the outside this place kind of looks like a hole. I mean, it's basically in a garage. Don't be fooled by its modest exterior. The food here is absolutely amazing. My personal favourite is the chicken and beef shawarma , with lots of garlic sauce. The owner is a really cool guy who (if you know to ask) has some extra hot sauce behind the counter for those who dare. I eat here religiously once a week, more if I can get away with it."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Calgary! I've never been disappointed with the food here. The owner is super friendly and the service is great. Don't be scared off by the exterior, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"The best shawarma in Calgary, friendly environment, and excellent customer service"}
{"text":"This is my fave place to go for a Shawarma! Buddy here is so nice.  Have been coming here for years and I am pretty sure he remembers all of his regulars. Regardless, he treats everyone the same - with kindness. You can taste it in the food that he loves what he does. The Shawarma's are always super saucy, and the chicken seasoned and cooked perfectly. Did I mention the pickled turnip? YUMO!. Lovely fresh ingredients used every time, you can count on it.  Calgary Shawarma - def has my vote ;) 

Worth your while to drive up and over a few blocks to crescent heights hill \"the view\" to overlook our beautiful city while or after enjoying your meal.

(note there is limited seating inside the restaurant, see pics for details)"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I had in Calgary. Clean resturant great ingredients.  Next meal is going to be from there again.  Owe we was very nice"}
{"text":"I had a beef wrap. Bread was fresh meat was perfect loaded with fresh veggies. Somewhat spicy. Service was prompt and helpful when choosing the food since this was my first time here. I would definitely recommend this place. Much better that McDonalds or subway."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a Calgary thing, but unless the food is handmade by the best chef in the Middle East, under no circumstances should a falafel sandwich cost $8. With a drink, I paid over $12. In Toronto, $12 gets you a falafel platter with all of the fixins, a side of pita, and a drink. The falafel was OK--the man microwaved something in the back after I ordered and smashed the falafels into my sandwich which was kind of off-putting since I look for crunchiness in a falafel, not a pile of spiced mush. It tasted pretty good though, I must say.

Someone needs to spend an hour cleaning and updating this place, because an hour is all it would take to make this place look so much better. Perhaps this is a reflection of laziness.

All in all, this place is ridiculously expensive and the food is just better than average. If I didn't live around the corner I don't know if I'd come back."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! Food was fresh and the service was prompt. Waiting in line was worth it.  We got the Shawarma rice plate and it was delicious. Flavors were spot on and loved the garlic sauce and spiced sauce on the side! Yum! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I loved it! I just came by to buy something quick to get back to work and I found this pleasant surprise. It is a very good shawarma place, looks clean and opens late.

I got a mix shawarma (chicken and beef) with all the vegetables and no spicy sauce, and it was simply terrific.

Totally recommended."}
{"text":"They've got 2 locations, this one being their DT flagship one.

One of my corporate tech clients were quite pleased with their quality and catering service during the busy Christmas holidays."}
{"text":"This is my favorite shawarma place in Calgary! The owner is a gem and seems to remember every customer that has ever walked in there."}
{"text":"I religiously order chicken shawarma and have never been disappointed.  I won't lie about the fact that I avoided this place for awhile because they don't have the most attractive neighbors (an auto repair shop) and I thought it might be a bit dingy, but I'm glad I was wrong!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter is awesome, talks about things that have your interest . Not simple how's the weather conversation. Rather refreshing. Quality was great, I will return"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food are key identifiers for this small shop. The moment you step in, the friendly guy behind the counter greets you and you almost feel like family. I'm pretty sure his regulars definitely have good conversations with him. 

My favourite thing here is the donair. You do get a generous helping of meat (seasoned with care) with what ever sides you want. If you are hungry go for he platter instead of he sandwich which comes with rice for more filling feeling. If you have a sweet tooth that needs satisfaction, you can also go for the baklava. 

Always satisfied with my order. Step in before 7pm (closing time) or you might go home hungry."}
{"text":"Even when the service was super friendly... The donairs were just ok... The hummus and the baba ghanoush were too salted for my taste... The food was absolutely unimpressive ..... I don't think I would go back here..."}
{"text":"OMG I forgot to mention this place in my original list about baklava! Just wanted to say that sometime last year, I was doing burlesque rehearsal with the gals at a friend's place and when we got hungry, we walked up Edmonton Trail to this neat, almost-hidden Shawarma place. Not only was the baklava very tasty (I wanted to go back for more!) but the guy behind the counter even gave us a bit of a deal on it. Probably just because we bought a few pieces at a time. Yum!"}
