{"text":"Decided to visit this place a few months ago when they were located near the postal depot and found the food expensive for the portions and nothing special.  Then, we went to eat at Trattoria Restauranton on Edmonton Trail and found it was no longer there and this restaurant had moved from their old location and taken up the space.  It was decorated better than Africana's previous location which was dingy and dark, so we decided to stay and try them again.   That was a mistake!  When we received it, the whole meal was cold (not even warm!).  When the waiter finally came by and we advised him our food was cold, he abruptly told us that was not possible.  I welcomed him to try it, since he seemed to imply that I was lying, but he said he would take care of it.  He returned 5 minutes later with the platter and said he had reheated the food for us.  When asked how, he replied \"in the microwave\".  I couldn't believe that I was paying $80.00 for a platter of microwaved food - the beef, chicken and shrimp were now hard and dry, while the casava was limp and soggy.    When we told him this, he said that the food is the way it is supposed to be.  I asked for the manager and after waiting for 10 minutes asked for the bill, which took another 10 minutes - and still no manager!  I asked the waiter why the manager hadn't come and he said he was busy.  I went to find the manager and saw him sitting near the bar having a drink with a friend.  When I approached he said \"yeah I know, I'm coming\".  I told him I wanted to leave and he told the waiter to take 5% off my bill - for a platter that was still 3/4 full and inedible.    I paid and left and will never return.    Do yourself a favour and avoid this place - horrible food and even worse customer service.    I recently tried a place called Safari Grill.  If you want to have African food done right, go to Safari Grill, it's about 10 minutes from here with amazing food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Service was awesome she was friendly and very helpful, food was amazing!! Overall great experience and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Really not my favourite place in Calgary but if you're looking for something spicy, this place is your best bet. I found the prices a bit high for the portion and quality of food you get but they do have daily specials. The decor is a bit off putting but service is prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"Honestly, amazing food. I came to Calgary for 4 days and was always told I have to go here by friends and family.  The ribs were seasoned so well, the fries and mogho were great, the corn was good, and the mishkaki was too.   Having an East African background, the food made me feel so welcome and happy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, we had the beef ribs,  peri peri chicken, corn and ugali. Excellent flavor we really enjoyed the meal and more than enough food, we are taking the rest home."}
{"text":"This place offered us a free meal, due to the FMM evacuation situation - thank you Amin and Alex (owners), first and foremost, for opening up your hearts and your kitchen to us.   And then came the food. This is what we had:  Chuma's World Famous Beef Ribs - Wow. Juicy and full of flavor. We intend on making our way through their other flavors. Meat could have been a bit more tender.   Chicken Tikka - possibly one of the best i've tried, outside of India! Tender, succulent and full of the oh-so-good 'masalas'!  Daal - tasty, full of spice, great for warming up and getting rid of a stuffy nose.  Goat curry - Excellent curry, spices were on point. Meat could have been a bit more tender.  Sweet lassi - on point.  They've been open for ~2 months in their current location. Good people with good hearts serving good food. I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars but that's not an option unfortunately .... the 0.5 star eludes them, but not for long i'm sure - please tenderize the beef ribs and goat in the goat curry, and that 0.5 star shall be yours! :-)  Thanks again for your hospitality! We will see you again very soon."}
{"text":"I can only really review the butter chicken take out, as I have not tried anything else.  I keep coming back for the butter chicken...as a matter of fact I may have it for lunch today.  the sauce is very ,very good and the rice is perfect, the only complaint I can give about the butter chicken is you are lucky to get more than 4 chunks of chicken in your bowl."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  The flavours, portions and prices are all a great value.  I've tried their butter chicken lunch specials and for $9 it's an inexpensive lunch (includes a can of pop).  Their BBQ ribs are drenched in some tangy goodness which more than makes up for the lack of meat.  The service is really really really slow.  Did I mention it was slow?  So slow that when no one else is in the restaurant you end up waiting 30min. for just two dishes.  I've only seen one server in the whole place and she doesn't multitask or know the menu very well either.  The decor is stuck somewhere between a sports pub (3-4 TV's) and a family restaurant.  What really shines here is the food and if they got some proper wait staff and a better decor it would easily be a 4 or 5-star place in my books."}
