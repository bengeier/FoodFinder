{"text":"I love ordering from this place. The bento boxes are great. When I eat sushi, I do my best to try at least every roll on the menu once. I've never been let down (Spider roll is my fav.) I have also never tried Sweet Potato Tempura before, but it's really good. 

The staff are really nice too. They seem to know me, because I made a mistake on an order once and they actually called to ask if it was correct. That was pretty great."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place a few times through just-eat. Food is not bad but their delivery sucks. Usually late and very often cold. Ordered food yesterday and this time the driver asked for a tip after arriving half an hour late and with cold food! I prefer Hokkaido sushi on Mount Pleasant."}
{"text":"Never had their food delivered but no review can tell you how great this place really is. 

Cheap! And food that is FRESH. Go around to other AYCE spots n its not nearly as fresh as this, its like every bite feels different. 

Ive had all the special rolls (i avoid mayo ones but ay, everyone ive gone with loved them), and their salmon sashimi is something i could eat for hours. Miso soup or salads are awesome, and the chinese food they offer is actually pretty great too."}
{"text":"I came here after Rainbow Sushi shutdown and moved camp...

The first round I received were Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Sushi, it was fine passable color some slight browning on the edges with a firm texture, overall still edible.

However this all changed on round 2... I started off by ordering a 2nd round of Salmon Sashimi and well at first I was kind of applaud by the chef sizing me up thinking the last 7 dishes he just served me I wasn`t able to finish this 1 dish... he ended up half sizing me on the sashimi, but that`s not my problem.

My problem with the 2nd round was the sashimi I was about to bite into was brown... very visibly were talking dalmatian spots of brown of which I didn`t notice until the 3rd I bit into which had the texture of mash potatoes... If its one thing I know about salmon sashimi it`s that it needs to be like all salmon sashimi served fresh and as fast as possible, which qualities are as follows:

Bright Orange / Pink color
Firm Texture Similar to that of squeezing your cheek
Most Importantly NO FISHY SMELL OR TASTE

Although taking in consideration the second it starts to smell is a dead give away it doesn't mean it may not still be bad or carry parasites and seeing as the second round I had with them was very questionable I raised my concern with my waitress who promptly just looked at the chef and breezed past him without a word.

I don't know about you but the next time I pay $21 for an attempt at my own life I think I'd rather take the chance at eating blow fish before I eat here because that's more likely to happen before I come here again.

P.S Also if you didn't read any of that at least do your own due diligence, check out their health inspections and how many times they've failed crucial violations.... I'll give you a hint their number 1's are neck and neck with cleanliness on their employees and their food prep. So hey you're life you can choose how to die."}
{"text":"Not long ago we were feeling lazy and decided to stay close to home. We were walking to Royal Elephant, but when we saw that Sushi Ocean offers AYCE, a decision was made on the spot. It looked like a good deal too @ $21pp.
We walked in - no ambiance, but hey, we were hungry and feeling lazy. 
We were seated and got our menus right away. We asked the server if we could order multiple times (which we could), and decided not to order much in right away.The food arrived shortly - very good shrimp tempura, spider roll, red dragon and eel roll. Though the worst salmon sushi pizza I've ever had - greasy with barely any salmon on top. All in all, decent so far.
Well... we were ready for more. So we ordered some more stuff. I wish I had taken pictures!!! The spider roll in 1 round (no complaints) vs. spider roll in 2 round (finger-thick rice, and 4 pieces as opposed to 8???), uneven mango roll with NO salmon in some pieces and NO mango in others??? and again, more rice than in rolls in round 1. Oh, and the killer - fish roe sushi - an inch-thick rice layer and tiny-tiny (1/10 of an inch) layer of fish roe so that you can see the rice below it. 
I guess, if what you order gets over $21, the quality of the food starts to decline
My advice: If you do go there order it all in round 1..."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile now, and tonight I finally had the opportunity to stop in for some take out. The place was some what busy and the lady at the cash told me that it would it might take up to 30 min for take out. I said that I could probably wait about 20 min and she said she would go back and talk to the guys making the food. She returned shortly after and said they could do it in 20 min and I said great. I gave he my order and sat at a table by the window waiting. The one thing that really stood out was that there were two table that needed to be cleaned off there were grey bins on the table stacked with dirty plates.

My food came in about 20 min and the tables were still the same way i found them when I walked in. i grabbed my take out and headed home. I had the Dynamite roll and the chicken teriyaki roll with some edamame beans, the rolls were delish and I can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"I spent my formative sushi years (ie University) in Edmonton, AB, where all-you-can-eat sushi would set you back about $40. When I moved to Toronto, the concept of $20 all-you-can-eat seemed a little sketchy to me. This place put my fears to rest.
The fish is good. The individual pieces are a little small, but in this case, who cares? There is no limit on how many pieces of anything you can order (except for the dark tuna.) The range of choice is also enough to satisfy, with both Japanese and Chinese options, although I'd stick mainly to the Japanese; the quality just isn't quite there with the Chinese food.
Now, to the reason they lost one star with me: the service. If you go there for the AYCE, and ask for more than 4-5 things, expect them to miss at least one thing you ordered. Also, if you want your drink refilled, you must flag the waitress. Every time. At least once.
But if you have the patience, this is a good place for sushi. And at a price that lets you go more than once every three months."}
{"text":"Was hungry and decided to order sushi via  just-eat and selected sushi ocean. What a bad decision, the fish tasted like day old sushi. And funny enough, the driver actually ASKED for a tip. Jeez. That's what I get for sushi delivery."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with my girlfriend. For the price of $23 i found the portions very small and they definitely cheeped out on the fish. Lots of rice and cucumber filler and little of what you actually want. 
On top of the not so mediocre food the staff was also very unprofessional. As a few tables were eating the servers and cooks sit at the back tables on their phone. Good luck getting their attention. Overall for the price there are a million better restaurants not far away."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and love it.

For other commenters.....First you need to understand that Just Eat has nothing to do with the restaurant other than delivering the orders. To rate this restaurant based on bad delivery or tips etc is unfair. Complain to Just Eat. We use Just Eat to order from other , totally unrelated restaurants and have run into these issues so it's in no way directly related to Sushi Ocean. 

Sure some nights are better than others but of all the AYCE places in this price bracket we have not been disappointed. 

The sushi is good, maki and other dishes are good too. We have sometimes asked for alterations to a dish, such as less sauce and they have always complied without complaint. It's perfectly good AYCE. The staff have been friendly on all of our visits and while the language  barrier can be taken for rudeness we've NEVER had staff stand over us and watch what we eat. They have always brought us food without attitude no matter how many times we order food.

We love this place and even though we visit other restaurants like Raw in Liberty Village for sushi these guys have been great as a local alternative."}
{"text":"The sushi here just isn't great. Poorly constructed and not as tasty as some other spots. The sashimi was quite nice but cut in a really clunky manner.

There are certainly many superior AYCE places in Toronto."}
{"text":"First time ordered sushi online delivery, I was expecting good quality, but it was terrible. The employees who work there, I think they're all Chinese. It wasn't clean.
The sashimi isn't fresh and the sushi with fried tempura were yuk! I paid over $50, just waste my money and it's not worth it. I won't order the food here again, Never! Also, the delivery took more than an hour."}
{"text":"You know what it was alright, I would of liked a little less rice then they gave. They would put so much rice expecting you to get full off that but it wasn't really a great thing because with the amount of rice i didn't eat I didn't order anymore (I guess they like that) but yeah cheap price but also they are cheap on the food. I would rather spend the extra 5$ to go somewhere nice. Also the water tasted pretty gross."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to place for a year or more while visiting Toronto and now that I live there I probably eat from Sushi Ocean more than I should admit (more than three times most weeks). I keep going back because the place is clean, the service is fairly efficient, and the price is cheap. Oh, also the nice washroom, a rare treat in affordable Toronto sushi places.

I find the quality of the AYCE is on par with the a la carte menu. Dinner has all the standard options, pretty diverse menu, and is something like $17 on a weekday. The lunch AYCE is a little smaller and has less fish but still has plenty of options. 

When it comes to delivery they are pretty quick. I live and breathe for the enoki mushroom maki. It's enoki tempura and spicy mayo. How can you go wrong with that? I need it delivered twice a week or I can't function. My delivery order has only been screwed up once out of dozens of orders and the next time I ordered they remembered and sent what they had forgotten the time before. Top notch customer service in my opinion.

The service isn't terribly personable, but it is efficient and polite enough, so no points deducted. If you're looking for fine-dining sushi this obviously isn't your place but if you want cheap and bountiful food that is tasty, hit this place up."}
{"text":"Had take-out from here the other night and it was amazing! All veggie order, lots of variety, and we had way more than enough to eat. Will definitely order from here again and might go there to eat-in as well. Yumyumyum!
PS. The spicy avocado roll is the best!"}
{"text":"Service is fine but the food is probably the worst AYCE sushi in Toronto. I've tried over 10-20 sushi places since my gf is a sushi addict and this was by far our worst sushi experience so far."}
{"text":"AYCE for $19. I guess that's a good deal in Toronto, right?

Wrong. This place is really crappy. Just your typical Chinese operated Japanese restaurant wanna-be. The food is really sub-par but edible. The rolls were not authentic at all and they add crunchy fried bread crumbs to all your rolls, hoping to fill you up fast. They cannot make simple rolls properly. I ordered a spider rolls and instead of soft shelled crab, they placed a piece of fried shrimp in the middle..um, no? 

Besides the sushi rolls, there was not much to the menu. Most of the food was either, sushi rolls, sashimi (we'll talk about the later), or fried stuff from the kitchen. We ordered chicken wings and it was fried to the point where it was dried up and hard. We just sent it back.

When we arrived we were told to sit wherever we wanted. So we picked the seat closest to the entrance because my mom's nose was very sensitive to the greasy stench produced in this restaurant. They just tossed us the all you can eat ordering ticket and left us with a pen. We placed our order and it came out and we indulged. Half way into our meal, we realized we had no water, because the waiter never served it to us. Then when we never had our water refilled...

Sigh. The best part about this place is the sashimi selection they offered. You can have as many pieces as you'd like. Most place, at least where I'm from - NY, will never offer this on their menu. So props to these guys.

TLDR: This place serves cheap AYCE sushi. Come at your own discretion."}
{"text":"I'm starting to get it: if it's \"AYCE\", NEVER, EVER ask for the AYCE. 

I had just biked to this neighborhood and there's the most evil hill on Bathurst St. I was desperate to have food. I found a little sushi place and asked for their a la carte menu. 

Awesome misoshiro, tasting fresh and with real tofu and green onion inside. I was so amazed with the misoshiro that my server offered me another bowl at no cost. 

I ordered an 8-piece sashimi, and had a nice conversation about what fish I should have instead of crab, that I don't like. The sashimi pieces are BIG, again FRESH and very well cut! 

I was well served, had good food an the price was awesome. I left a good tip for them and left feeling so happy!

They seem new and offer 10% off if you dine-in or take out."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's not the most attractive sushi joint.  But it still has a decent offering, especially for this stretch of Eglinton, which is lacking in sushi spots.  They have descent speedy delivery.  They also have a reasonable all-you-can eat option, which they offer also at lunchtime.  The risk you run is that you may have to pull a George Costanza and sleep under your desk when you go back to work."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Sushi Ocean on Just-Eat. The food got to my place relatively quickly, definitely much faster than most take-out places in Toronto.  I got a Miso Soup, Edamame, a Spicy White Tuna Jalapeño Roll, a Spicy Salmon Roll, and a Rainbow Roll.

I thought the food was hit-or-miss. The miso soup was very tasty. The edamame was alright. I felt it wasn't salty enough, but at least the portion was huge. 

As for the sushi, I wasn't a fan of the Spicy White Tuna Jalapeño roll as I found the taste of cilantro too overpowering and the uncooked jalapeño on top really clashed with texture of the tuna. I would have preferred for the jalapeño flavour to be integrated inside the roll. The Spicy Salmon roll was a bit too bland and the roll was kinda messy. I didn't try the Rainbow Roll (allergic to cucumber), but my boyfriend said it was pretty good.

The food at Sushi Ocean is rather unimpressive. If you want memorable sushi, go somewhere else."}
