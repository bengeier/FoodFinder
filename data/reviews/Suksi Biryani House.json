{"text":"Hands down the BEST indian food restaurant in Toronto - FYI, I am an indian food fanatic. Everytime I visit, their food has been consistently amazing: great flavor profile, selection, texture, etc. I can't say enough good things about their food. MUST try their Shrimp Vindaloo, Butter chicken, and Korma. Their lunch special is also great: comes with many different dishes, and can be easily enough for two meals!

If you want to dine in, keep in mind that the restaurant space is very limited.

My only two regrets are:
1. unfriendly owner
2. closed on sundays"}
{"text":"Sorry.. But this is probably the worst Indian I have ever had. 

I don't think any of their curries are fresh.. Their briyani is simply rice with some food coloring and chicken. I would avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"Tried the butter chicken and shahi paneer. Both tasted like a can of Campbell's tomato soup was used for the sauce, and not much else. There were maybe 7-8 pieces of paneer and the chicken was sparse as well. Would not order again, even though it's literally a one minute walk from home."}
{"text":"Yes the pics are wrong for this place, it's a tiny joint !!!  The food here is excellent given the price. Basic but very tasty !!"}
{"text":"I've been to dinner, and taken out dinner from this location dozens of times in the time I lived in Toronto. The food is invariably great tasting, the value is great, and the service is very charming in its brusque way. 

It remains one of my favourite restaurants of all time, and I look forward to coming here whenever I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"My review is 3.5 I'd say.
Food-wise: 
Been there twice. Once for dinner - I really liked the food that time, the spices and the hotness of the dishes (veg biryani and malai kofta) really hit the spot, but the prices were a $1-2 more than what I saw online so I wanted to check the cheap lunch special. 
Lunch - $5.99 for the veg thali: half a papadam, rice, daal, 3 kinds of vegetable curries (I had the mixed veg, eggplant and cauliflower/potato. They also had chickpeas and potatoes). The food was tasty. However, I would say that I don't think they used fresh spices but a spice mix, which was good, but I like the genuine thing when I eat Indian food out. but I guess I can't complain for $5.99 for a big and filling portion...
Service-wise:
The dinner waiter was so rude we started laughing about it. Extremely rude! He brought a plate of papadam and took it after a minute when it was still full (!) to refill the dish and give it to another table (at least that's what I think happened).
If we asked for anything he just didn't say anything and walk away (so we didn't know if he got what we wanted or not) and overall seemed very grumpy.
I wasn't bothered by this because the food at dinner was very good and reminded me of India."}
{"text":"Great Biryanis for reasonable rate
Not a spacious place, so take out is the best bet"}
{"text":"Yes, while I am the Duke of this place, I would relinquish my crown if I could.

The last time I ate here was July 4, 2011, after ordering a butter chicken to go. It was about 2pm (this detail becomes crucial in a moment). I went home, ate my takeaway, then by 2:40, my stomach started churning. By 3pm, I was vomiting, followed by several trips to the bathroom over the next 48 hours.

Yes, I suspect I got a dose of food poisoning. The fact that it came on within 30 minutes of eating made me immediately suspect my takeaway.

Long story short, after about 3 days of the worst cramps and other maladies that accompany food poisoning, I was back on my feet.

The new issue for me became: do I tell Biryani House, and if so, how do I put it to them? I decided to mention my experience to them, as a service to other future customers, and explained my situation nicely. I did not ask for compensation, make threats, or say anything untoward. I thought it had to be something in the butter chicken dish itself. The fellow who always serves at the counter said he couldn't think of anything, and seemed surprised that I would even mention it. OK, that's that, I thought, I told them, and they would deny it. Fine, move on.

A week or so later, I bumped into the same person from the resto again, this time in the Canada Post parking lot, and I asked him if he used ghee (clarified butter) in his butter chicken. He said he does sometimes. I asked if it was possible his ghee could become rancid, thereby explaining what happened to me. He took this idea on board, and finally said, \"It was possible\".

A number of times over the past 6 months, I have seen the owner again, and he has invited me to come back. I told him then that I could if I would, but the whole 72 hours of food poisoning etc has made my stomach flip at the smell of Indian spices, which is a tragedy, because I love the cuisine.

I waited 6 months to write this review, because I did not want to write it from a place of anger or upset. I don't want anyone else to experience what I went through, and upon reading recent reviews, it would appear that nothing has changed.

Your experience may be different, but I do not feel comfortable eating here anymore or recommending it to anyone.

I'll leave my old review up so people can see how I once felt.

Now, where can I leave this Dukedom crown .....?"}
{"text":"I just ate lunch here because I missed my home (Bangladesh) and the place succeeded. Although the serving style isn't five star, it is how food is served in the more rural parts of the country. The Butter Chicken was great; the meat was soft and the curry sauce was sweet. The portions were large too and I was very satisfied after.
However I took the combo platter and I was given the option of two vegetables and the eggplant dish was a little bland in taste as was the egg. 

But I will definitely come back here for the naan and butter chicken"}
{"text":"The server was cool,but the food,even it's lunch special and cheap,I can only sigh for it.Sorry."}
{"text":"An absolute gem! Wonderful place to grab some Lamb Biryani, Mango Lassi, or Rogan Josh. Have been here a number of times over the past few years and have always walked away happy. The flavour combinations are impressively authentic and the price is just incredible. The portion sizes are very very good. I don't think I've ever been able to finish all of the food. 

While the host can come off as a bit distant at first, if you give him a chance, you'll realize that he's a wonderful person who always remembers his customers. 

But above all, the food is phenomenal. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"As close to a British curry in Toronto that I've had so far. Had the chicken madras, lamb biriyani, okra, rice and garlic nan. All very good. Very reasonably priced. Venue is a bit small and pokey, but the quality of the food - obviously the most important thing, absolutely did not disappoint! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Note that there are two businesses named Biryani House, this is the hole-in-the-wall no frills thali place on Hayden St, the other is a more lavish institution near Wellesley. This review pertains to the former.

Biryani House is not bad.  Its not great Indian food, but it has its charms.

Its Indian-style Thali, meaning, you get a tin \"lunch tray\" with a Simple salad with yogurt and cumin dressing, a sweet rice desert, some rice with daal and your choice of three other dishes  -- three vegetarian or two vegetarian and one meat. They vary depending on the day, but usually there is a Baigan Bharta (eggplant) Aloo Gobi (Califlower), Black chickpea Chana, Mutter Paneer (cheese and peas) some potato. Sometimes Saag Paneer. (Spinach). You also get a half of a Papadam (Lentil Cracker) laid out on your cafeteria tray under your disposable plastic fork. (grr)

The place is teeny, seats less than 20 and is a very tight squeeze. Come in, squish your way though the tables towards the food-serving counters and order at the cash. It is always the same two men working. One will take your payment and get you pop or lassi, and the other will scoop your choices from the cafeteria style metal pans. 

The bonus points are that since the food is pre-made (other than naan which is made when you order it)  it is served to you relatively quickly - meaning if you can get a seat, its a fast lunch. The portion is gigantic and will fill you up for certain. Vegetarian Thali with pop is in the $8 range. 

Minus Points 
- the food is NEVER hot, only lukewarm (comes with the territory)
- you are often left watching a single guy and his jacket take up an entire 4 top as you stand there with your tray. 
- Disposable plastic forks
- Not AT ALL SPICY IN THE LEAST. If you are looking for any form of spice or traditional Indian fare, you will not get it here. This place is western-washed to the max.

Take your dirty tray back up to the front, and let people sit down. This is how it goes here, they don't usually buss the tables right away.  And please don't order \"take out\" and then sit down and unpack your Styrofoam and plastic meal at the table only to eat it there. What a waste. You are not saving any time, this place is fast."}
{"text":"This place holds innumerable memories for me.  Biryani House is like your favourite hole in the wall Indian restaurant, complete with surly waiter (yes he's the only waiter so learn to love him), ridiculously over-sweet yet equally addictive mango lassi, super-small dining space and impeccably delicious food.  While it's moved from its previous location on Roy Square (damn you 1 Bloor East!!!!) and the new place is definitely less charming, the eggplant curry is still heartwarming, the multitude of chicken curries still delicious and the waiter still angry.

I find that dinner is better than lunch, but the lunch specials are very good value and tasty and there's that corridor park running along the east side of Yonge that could make for a good take out spot.  Dinner with a good friend in this cozy little space can be magical."}
{"text":"Have been periodically visiting this Biryani House (not to be confused with the \"nicer\" Biryani House just south of here on Wellesley, with food that is not nearly as comparable) for years.

Yes, the setting is not ideal, but these are the gems that you find hidden in Toronto that, despite their aesthetics, produce consistent mouth-watering cuisine.

Highly recommend the biryani dishes as well as the naan bread. Prices are ridiculously inexpensive (despite price increases in the past) for the quality and volume of food. Spicing and combination of flavours beats any other biryani dish I've tasted even in Little India.

There was only one time where the food was noticeably subpar, and it was because the owner was not cooking the food, as he typically is (he does deserve a day off!).

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I loved the daal makhani. One of the best I've had in so long. Decent price. Though not an amazing ambience. But worth it for take-outs. Should try!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Indian place I have ever been to. Their butter chicken is unparalleled. I can't even eat it at other places because they just can't compare. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for friendly service and a great meal. Good job, Suksi Biryani House, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Seems this place has more than one name. The menu reads as Suhkhi Biryani House.

We only ordered one dish (lamb bhuna) for take out but two things were clear - it's very spicy and the service is not friendly. Also, the take out menu I grabbed had no indication of spiciness levels. Based on other reviews I reckon almost every item should have three little chili pepper icons next to it. 

The naan was reasonably good but a little chewy. The lamb was also too tough but there were fair amount of pieces in the dish. It was possible to taste some flavour in the dish but the majority was spicy heat. The food was fast and cheap, so three stars it is."}
{"text":"This is a small place on a side street off Yonge and almost Bloor. When filled it could seat about 20, but on a summer Saturday at seven I had the place to myself. Me and the scowly waiter. Maybe he was scowly because he was looking past me out the window to all the people walking by and wondering why they don't fill his restaurant up. And they should. It's a nice indian restaurant with a lot of menu options, including half a page of \"Vegetarian Delights.\" I chose the Dhal Makhani, which is a lentil/spinach bowl, which came with some white rice. Naan was $1.99 extra, and with a ginger ale the total was just over $12 with tax. The Dhal was nice. I imagine it would be even better if I didn't hamper the cook by asking for it without cream and the naan without garlic butter. Or maybe the waiter was scowling at me wondering how I could enjoy just plain, non-creamy food. But it was really good, and the service was really good too. The scowly waiter asked how the meal was at the appropriate time, was prompt with clearing the table and the bill, and was pleasant when I was paying by debit. There was a bit of a smile there at the end."}
{"text":"Being of Indian descent I perhaps am most critical in reviewing Indian restaurants. However, this place can probably dish out better tasting chicken biryani than any other Indian restaurant in the downtown core.

The chicken biryani is flavorful and unique from the avg overpriced Indian fast food joints. It is completely boneless and for $7.10 comes with a, raita yogurt, onions, and lettuce and a couple of tomato pieces, and rice pudding [note the salad, yogurt, and the rice pudding are just a few spoonfuls theyre a very small side portion].

Another item to try is the Kadhi [Pakora Curry] which he only makes every Friday - this truly tastes like the authentic one my mom makes in her kitchen - very good."}
{"text":"I went to the Biryani House on Hayden because I wanted cheaper curry than the Indian Hut on Church was offering. I ordered mattar paneer, chicken korma, onion bhaji, and rice and it came to about $22. Yes, this place will do just fine for my curry cravings. 

It's not that I can't handle spicy food, but I ordered what I thought are 2 mild dishes. Both had a good kick to them, which I found surprising but acceptable. I wonder if anyone else is not so accepting of a traditionally mild dish served spicy. 

I've done take-out twice now, and both times the waiter/host failed to impress me with customer service skills. Monosyllabic responses to every question might be efficient, but it isn't pleasant. While I waited, he grunted at the other tables in what (I think) was offering refills on the drinks. The second time I ordered over the phone in advance, and the phone manner was equally poor. Meh. I don't care that much. If I can feed me and my boyfriend, with some leftovers for lunch the next day, all for 20 bucks, I'm satisified.

Oh and there is another Biryana House just on Wellesley (I think) that is much bigger, and must be where these photos are from."}
{"text":"Excellent fast service. Great food. It always leaves me feeling full and satisfied. The dishes are one of the best tasting Indian foods I've had. Dinner for two cost $23 with tax. Nice place to go for a quick, cheap dinner."}
{"text":"A shame.

I've been here a few times throughout the year.

The first time was decent.
They changed ownership.
The prices for the lunch specials went up.
Still cheap, but anyways.

I stopped in the other day because my sister and her friend were having lunch.  With sad faces they asked me to help them eat some of the food and drink their barely-touched mango lassies.

Who doesn't finish a mango lassi?
Well, it's understandable if the lassi is too-thick yogurtless-over-spiced dribble that tasted horrible.

The naan was overcooked, dry, flavourless and just bad.

The butter chicken had no spice at all, no cream, and was basically tomato paste slapped on chicken.

It was a sad day.

And yes, the photos posted are totally wrong. The place is more of a hole in the wall with maybe 8 tables.  The chef's aren't Indian and this isn't a place I will go for Indian food."}
{"text":"Another go-to lunch place.  Their butter chicken lunch special is the ultimate comfort food for me after a long morning at work.  For an easy $9 (after-tax!), you get a main meat dish (butter chicken ftw!), two side vegetable curries (e.g. eggplant, cauliflower, or potato and okra), rice with lentils, and a rice pudding for dessert.  Leaves me full and satisfied every time :D

On other days of the week, they have other lunch specials, including curry chicken, tandoori chicken, sag chicken, chicken masala, and lamb curry.  Butter chicken is still my favourite, but there are a ton of other choices.  Extremely fast, efficient, and friendly service.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero or minus stars to this place I would! Absolutely horrible service (borderline rude) and overpriced dinner for the worst Indian food I've ever had in my life. Being of Indian descent, I have eaten at my fair share of Indian restaurants.  This is the worst Indian food I have ever paid for in my entire life ! The person who took my order on the phone (I suspect he is the owner) was so utterly unfriendly that I almost felt like calling back to cancel my order and in retrospect I should've done that ! The restaurant is the most depressing looking place and makes me wonder about the hygiene of this place. Some reviewers have complained about food poisoning and I can totally see why ! I will never set foot in this place again and would recommend you don't either if you don't want to eat over priced horrible Indian food which might leave you with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a budget, and their lunch specials pack a lot of food for its price in this area.  Also, given that no customer was speaking a word of English, to me, that's a great sign.

Lunch special had quite a lot of variety as I was able to choose 2 of the 3 veggie dishes available in each combo, along with 1 meat.  Pack in some rice, and some authentic Indian cooking, and man, I'd totally come back for a budget lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Always enjoyed getting indian food here whether it be in their lunch special or for dinner. A big fan of the Shrimp Vindaloo, which has the right amount of spice and is very flavorful. As for taste, it is definitely one of the better indian restaurants i've been to in and outside of Toronto. I've been there probably a dozen times to eat over the years.

The owner who is usually at the shop is not friendly, but usually isn't rude either. The restaurant is located right off the Hayden exit on the Bloor/Yonge subway station. The interior of the restaurant is very small, probably couldn't fit much more than 20 comfortably. I remember having to scoot my chair a few times to make sure I wasn't in the way when people walked by. 

I would recommend it for doing takeout."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place pretty close to Bloor station. 

I got the lamb biryani. I thought that the portion was fairly generous (including a fair amount of lamb), and the price was reasonable. I've had better biryani's elsewhere though... I couldn't exactly figure out what was \"wrong\" though... I think the taste was slightly tomatoey. 

Overall, it was not bad. I  wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying something different if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very small hole in the wall Punjabi Place with great food. Very good lunch special with aloo Gobi, Dal, and all kinds of goodies. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have tried a variety of curry dish here, and they were all spectacular and bombed me with subtle flavors. I am no Indian, but I believe this is pretty dang authentic. Moreover, who can beat their prices? Perfect

They only lose 1 star because the owner really isn't the most pleasant person to deal with. :("}
{"text":"Our fave Indian restaurant in Toronto! You can say it's a hole in the wall but the food is soooo good! No it's not a mix of Pakistani and Indian flavours, it's authentic Indian cuisine! This place is a gem in disguised. If you don't care about the size of the restaurant or the attitude of the server (he is actually quite nice and funny if you get to know him), this place is for you! All of the dishes we've tried and cooked by the owner himself are to die for!!! Oh the burst of flavours!!!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker use to love this place for their takeout thali and butter chicken, however I was never the biggest fan because I always felt they were short and rude with me.  However, on my last visit, the guy at the counter was quite pleasant and explained the special to me. While they have daily specials, their thali isn't much more expensive, so value is good either way.

Food order: Tandoori chicken Monday special, comes with two vegetable curries, rice, rice pudding and papadum for $6.99.

The Tandoori chicken wasn't too spicy, however it was so juicy, it made up for it.  For my two curries, I got some lentil and something that had broccoli and cheese, I believe.  These were so aromatic and absolutely delicious.

Verdict: this is a great Indian takeout place and don't let the looks fool you, it is safe to eat here.  :-)"}
{"text":"Biryani tastes like something I would make from a foodnetwork recipe, and then screw it up by adding the wrong spices and drying out the chicken.

I ordered garlic naan as well and the bread was covered in raw garlic and (surprise surprise) also didn't taste Indian.

Never going back here, I'm sticking with Lazeez biryani or even King Palace close by."}
{"text":"Very genuine, casual, cost-friendly place. They did raise the price by 40-50% tho but it is still fair considering the location and food they are serving. Very good Korma dish."}
{"text":"I am from India and I've had actual biryani. What is claimed to be biryani and served here is actually an embarrassment. I can imagine the owner/chef may wanna reduce the strong flavours to suit the western palette, but this is way too flavour and spice-less. Never doing this again."}
{"text":"Dinner menu is lil expensive than lunch menu. Food is pretty good but I didnt like  the sweetness in my butter chicken. Not very tidy and the owner is not very friendly."}
{"text":"When I worked in the Yonge & Bloor area, this was a place I would frequent.

They had an exceptional lunch deal and I loved their naan bread.

I believe this place is very authentic and absolutely worth the price when you go there for a weekday lunch. It was also a favourite among my coworkers. Even times when one of us packed our own lunch, it would sit in the fridge for an extra day because it got bumped for a Biryani House lunch special."}
{"text":"[Phone Call]: Hello Biryani House. Yes. I'd like to make a reservation for six people at 5:30 pm. We do not take reservations but I'll be here. Ok. Ok. Bye. Click! And, that's how it started. We get there, it's a hole. The place has seen worse days then Saigon and needs more facelifts then Joan Rivers to make it look good. BTW don't go to the bathroom. The waiter is a complete bitch. I said it. A complete bitch. Unless, and here's the key, you're a regular, which I'm not. Thank god! Get this, the food was good. Go figure."}
{"text":"Does anyone else think these are the wrong photos? The place on Hayden is beyond tiny. I usually wait outside for my take away because it's so small if you wait inside the single waiter can't get to his tables. 

And the staff ain't friendly, at least not the waiter I've had and I'm convinced he's the only waiter that works there. 

All that said, the food is delicious. Personally I like the butter chicken, channa masla, beef vindaloo but it's super spicy so watch out, and the just about everything else I've had. 

It's a perfect take away place if you live in the area. And very reasonably priced considering rice comes with the order."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible, one of my favourite places in the city.  The food is rich, fresh, and so flavourful.  And the manager really is a kind and warm-hearted man, we go to see him as much as for the food.  A great inexpensive restaurant, don't let the non-descript exterior fool you, this place is a real gem."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best lunch special in the Yonge/Bloor area.  The quantity is insane for the price.  The food isn't that bad either.  Their naans are cooked fresh right when you order them in the tandoor.  Great value for the price!"}
{"text":"I really don't know why people rated this place so low. Probably one of the best indian places I've been to. In addition, the owner has a great personality! The chicken biryani is AMAZING. The mango lassi and garlic naan is also a must try!"}
{"text":"One of the worst biryanis i have eaten in toronto took out the same lamb pieces that they use as curry for thali throw a bunch of spices in a fry pan  and called it a day worst ever for a place that calls itself biryani house they should be specialist  in the dish instead it was just b.s in the nsme of biryani"}
{"text":"Absolutely the most unauthentic Indian food I've ever had. Could be the worst Indian food in Toronto. And the service from the lone waiter is equally atrocious."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet during November 2011.  Nothing was hot, just luke-warm. The food, while edible, wasn't very good. Surprising, considering it is a prime location. The naan was alright.

The only redeeming dish was the smoked bharta, fresh and well-spiced.

Well, not coming here again."}
{"text":"Gotta say the reviews about this place were contrary to my experience tonight. We were having an Indian feast at a friend's place. Each either brought something from a restaurant or their Guju mum's home cookin. I chose this place and boy was that a mistake. My go to dishes whether in Bombay, Dubai or Toronto are Lamb Biryani and Dal Makhani. Both dishes here were sub-par. The dal was bland and slimy. If you want the slow cooked, melt in your mouth deep rich flavours of a classic dal makhani avoid this at all cost. The version here is best described as lentils suspended in a starchy solution heated and served. Same goes for the biryani. Looking for the symphony of flavours of aromatic spiced lamb and the pleasant sweetness of raisins that perfectly counter balance the heat of a well-made biryani? Look elsewhere. This version lacks any depth of flavour and was a bit stale tasting and clearly hastily thrown together. Maybe it was an off night for the restaurant, but one thing's for sure, the food was certainly off-putting."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up by $1 for the thalis. Had the meat thali which is $7.89+tax. I chose the curry chicken, muttar paneer and yellow dal and it comes with rice and a bit of salad. I got takeout so the salad was buried under the rice and the dal was on the rice.

Yummy! It was a little spicy which is perfect me as I am desi but not a big spice eater. You get a little container of rice pudding which is only a couple of spoons. 

I would definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Below average food. I ordered the biryani owing to the restaurant's-Suksi \"Biryani\" House and that \"Plate of rice\" was not Biryani. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout lunch on a Friday. The place is small and a bit dark but it doesn't change my rating of how good their food was. 

I ordered butter chicken lunch special and added a naan for $1.99 (The naan was freshly made on the spot yum!). The order came with rice and 2 vegetable choices so I went with eggplant and cauliflower. The portion was pretty big that I couldn't eat it all in one sitting. Total price came to $10 so the whole meal was super worth. 

Would come here more often!"}
{"text":"Live close by and have go there often, mostly because of proximity. Food is average. Vibe is not that great at all. Seating is limited and quality of food is probably a little below average. Menu is not extensive."}
{"text":"Great food, at a low price. The cashier was very nice, gave us good recommendations. Definitely would go more often."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, and the pricing is fair too. However, the owner (or who I assume is the owner) is not very friendly. No other complaints however."}
{"text":"Great lunch thali specials, I got two meat thali meals for $18 after tax. Huge portions. The butter chicken has a more tomato base and the eggplant Curry is incredible. They also allow you to bring your own containers for people who are health conscious and doing like eating out of styrofoam boxes. Lunch comes with a small rice pudding dessert!!!"}
{"text":"This is a really small place close to Yonge and Bloor.  I grabbed a spicy chicken vindaloo ($6.99) and a side of naan bread ($1.99) to go.  The chicken was really spicy, but also very flavourful. The naan bread was good as well, fresh and chewy, perfect for sopping up the sauce!  The lunch comes with rice, two sides and a tiny rice pudding. I had the eggplant and cauliflower dishes both were fairly tasty.  The entire meal was large and very filling. I'm only downgrading due to the amount of the main dish itself, thought there should of been a little more of it, versus the rice and sides."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this place since they were in Roy Square across the street, back when there was a Roy Square rather than condos condos condos. I don't live in Toronto anymore but I make sure to pay a visit every time I'm back, and drag a friend if possible.

Yes, the decor is spartan, but I don't think I've ever had a dish that I have disliked from here. Few other restaurants have this kind of 100% hit rate with me.

For a special treat, try the eggplant. No other name, just \"eggplant\". It's my favourite vegetarian dish (from here, and probably in general) and I've never found anywhere that does one similar."}
{"text":"Funny, always thought about this place as Briyani House, and not Suski Briyani House.  All good...  I'm yelping about the same place that I've gone to several times.

Was there again today, and again enjoyed the same thing I always get there: their vegetarian thali.  For $5.99, you could get a choice of 3 veg curries, plain basmati rice or naan, rice pudding, and some lentil dhal.  Portions (for someone with a heavy appetite) could have been larger, but for the average person, people seemed satisfied with portion sizes.  

The quality of the curries was good  - hit the spot!  You can't go wrong for $5.99.  ($6.99 for non-veg.  Hubby had one of those and was pretty happy).

Service was fast.  We had a commitment later this afternoon.  Eating here, saved us on some sweet time.

O.k.  About to say something unofficially racist here (but positive) - saw several others of South Asian decent, eat here.  From different social circles.  Just saying, if it's good enough for people who grew up with this culture, it's good enough for me, too!"}
