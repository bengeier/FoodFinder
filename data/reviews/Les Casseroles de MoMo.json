{"text":"Arwen, Serhiy, Ana and I met up there for brunch yesterday. This was my first visit to Les Casseroles and local community leader and owner did not disappoint in the least - heaping portions of tasty eats. Quebec traditional diner fare meets East Indian influence: eggs and toast or dim paratha or butter chicken poutine. It's all good and comes with a cup of splendid homemade-brewed black tea with cinnamon and cardamon undertones. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"The owner / chef is a delight, and will chat up a storm! This is a real neighbourhood community gem.

The chicken curry is the best I've ever tasted, and so so cheap! I honestly couldn't believe how good it was."}
