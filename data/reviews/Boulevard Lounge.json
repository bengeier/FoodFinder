{"text":"I popped in here today on this sweltering afternoon in search of something to review and to simply find a worthy burger. 

I think I was last in here in the early 80's as a little boy and ate a fish sandwich. 

It's a weird building as it actually sort of looks as if it was built right into the natural stone wall. There are steps that lead around to the back of the building. A secret entrance? Did Bruce Wayne open a bar and grill?

If he did, he found someone that makes that worthy burger I was on the hunt for. 

It's dark and cool like a wine cellar inside. I was one of two or three other people who were watching women's softball or Animal Planet or an old war movie, depending on which flatscreen TV yer lookin' at. Early afternoon is usually the only time I'll go to a bar since it's less likely to be packed and rowdy.

The bartender greets me, and I tell her what I want.

\"Dontcha wanna see a menu first?\" 

\"Oookay, I guess.\"

I'm glad I did, because I found something that's a cross between a Primanti's sandwich, complete with fries and slaw, and a bacon cheeseburger. 

They call it The Roethlisburger.

I know, I know. BOOOOO!

The guy who served it to me looked like he was either the owner or the bouncer or the cook. Maybe he's all of those. Think of the late Bam-Bam Bigelow. A nice guy despite his forboding appearance, he asks, \"Want it served in the bathroom stall?\"

Oh that was WRONG! But he said it, not me!

The burger though (I suggested they rename it) was anything BUT wrong. In fact, it was so very right! The meat was expertly charred. The slaw was sweet and creamy (differing from a Primanti's sandwich in that regard) and was a nice contrast to the bacon and cheese. The bun was soft and warm. The burger as a whole held together well. 

One doesn't get too bon viviant in a place like this, so I just told 'em it was a \"rill good burger.\" 

I didn't ask if they beer-battered the fries, but they tasted like they were. Or did they fry them twice? Who knows? Sloppy, droopy steak fries these were not. I mentioned in another recent review that Pittsburgh restaurants for the most part haven't mastered french fries and that they should learn how to make them from The O in Oakland.

Well, they could learn from Boulevard Lounge also. These fries were textbook good, a clinic in deep-fat-fried awesomeness.

They even gave me a hearty, chilly, dilly, pickle slice to go with everything.

I barely partake in the demon alcohol, but if a bar has good food and nice people working there, I'll show up. 

Hey if they got me to walk here from my house in 90 degree weather, there's no reason for you not to give them a try. 

Get a burger in the South Hills for once in yer life. Wot tha hell? 

And I was told they have live music tonight also. 

That burger name though...wait a minute...it felt like I was in the Batcave...yeah, call it the Batburger! Yeah. Genius."}
