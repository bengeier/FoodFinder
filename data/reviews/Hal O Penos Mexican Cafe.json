{"text":"When I said Pedros was the best Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix, I don't think I had been to Hal O Peno's yet. I love how roomy the establishment is. The servers are always friendly, quick, and accommodating. The never ending hot and fresh chip basket along with their mild and spicy red sauce is amazing. When my fiance and I go to Hal O Penos we both order the same thing. The shredded beef chimichanga fundido style combo is Efffing amazing. It is the holy grail of mexican food. If I were in prison on death row and was asked what my last meal would be, it would be that. I am never disappointed when we visit. Just writing this review is making me hungry for Hal O Penos. Damn yelp..."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the wait staff very pleasant.  The food is tame and geared towards east coast transplants, any Phoenix native can point you to more authentic Mexican, or Arizona-style Mexican restaurant for those of you that are looking for something that represents Southwestern taste a little better.  Great place to take your picky Grandfather from Minnesota, bad place to take your cousin from Guadalajara."}
{"text":"We just had dinner there. Was very good. BUT, they cook with lard. So if anybody is watching their cholesterol or fat, this is not a good thing. We need to encourage them to stop using it. Most Mexican food restaurants in the valley has stopped."}
{"text":"Went here upon a suggestion from friend.  Glad we went.  Took my son here for his birthday dinner.  Chips and salsa were good.  Son ordered the seafood chimi fundido style, which he enjoyed very much (that chimi was gone in no time).  I ordered the chicken chimi fundido style, my fav, and it was yummy.  I'm picky about refried beans and rice but I will have to so say that theirs is very tasty.  Server was friendly and attentive to our needs, came by quite often to make sure everything was ok.  Service was quite quick.  Didn't have to wait long for our food once our order was placed.    Nice little place.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"How do I get coupons for this place. Some people get them mailed to them and I hear that I can get them by email. Aquinonez74@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"Excellent POLLO FUNDIDO,  and BURGERS. I've been here twice and both times the food was really good."}
{"text":"Not bad. I went here with some coworkers for lunch. Everything was pretty standard. Nothing really jumped out at me as being great. The service was nice. I had a taco plate during for the lunch special.   I would say that overall this place is pretty standard as far as Tex-Mex fare is concerned. Nothing over the top, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this food is no joke.  I am especially fond of the green corn tamales because I can't get them in Texas...unless I go to Curras' :) the margaritas are excellent, decent beer list and this my second visit in less than a week!"}
{"text":"Can anyone tell me if Hal O Penos is still open? I drove by and it was repainted outside a a dumpster was outside the front doors. There signs are still out front but are not on. If anyone knows if they closed up or doing a remodel ols send me a message and let me know. Thank you, Brian H"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  We are sad to see that it has closed.  The sign on the door read \"To Our Customers.  Sorry to inform you we are closing.  Today (12-16) is our last day.  Hopefully we will be relocating soon.  We thank you for your patronage.  The Hal-O-Peno Staff and Owners.\"  I hope a new location is found...SOON!"}
{"text":"Hal O Penos has been our go-to mexican restaurant for over twenty years.  Most dishes I've tried have been delicious - that why I keep going back. Some of my favorites are the smoking platter of chicken fajitas with plenty of chicken strips and fixins, the taco salad, chile rellenos, and the chimichangas.  The refried beans are tasty, mostly whole beans, not just mashed like other restaurants serve. The salsa has a tangy fresh taste.  Pleasing Mexican style decor and tv tuned to the sports channel.  Good food and atmosphere, what's not to like!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food you are going to find. I do not know about a lot of the meals but any of the chimichangas fundido style cannot be beat and I think I have eaten at just about every Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix metro area.  Jordan's, the large chains, the dive joints on the south side nothing compares to Hal O Penos fundido style chimis.  It is so good that it is the first place me and my friend who moved to Salt Lake go when he comes to town.  The service is nothing special and the atmosphere is so so but the fundido style chimi with machaca beef still makes this little gem a five and I do not give many fives."}
{"text":"hal-o - penos is open. new address is 3507 W Northern"}
{"text":"Oh chicken chimichanga fundido style, how i love thee.  With your oozy layers of cheddar and cream cheese covering your cripsy skin.  Nestled so cozily between lovely piles of rice and beans, your a vision to behold and a pleasure to consume!  I grew up in phoenix and in high school my girlfriend-come-wife introduced me to the glory of Hal-O-Penos' Chicken Chimichanga Fundido Style and I was instantly smitten, with the girl and the food.  My best friend also fell in love, just with the food, and the three of us ate countless meals here for many years.  For my wife and I, the best strategy for poor high schoolers was to go for dinner and fill up on their yummy chips and salsa then take our chicken chimis home for dinner or lunch the next day.  They are awesome even reheated!  Alas, now my wife and I live in Salt Lake and are unable to satisfy our ravenous desire for Hals on a regular basis, but we still compare all other chimichangas to those glorious fundido style chimis and whenever we visit home, our first stop is always Hals with Clint."}
