{"text":"The food is awesome and they deliver... Those Philly cheese steak sandwiches are the bomb!my husband likes their cheese burger!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a cheesesteak sandwich and it was so not worth the wait. Not enough meat, lacked seasoning, not enough au jus sauce, no fries...and I shouldn't have to be charged for double meat to be satisfied.

Please take a trip to \"Taurus Flavors\" (Hoagie restaurant) or \"Taurus Sandwiches\" in Chicago and see what a \"real\" cheesesteak and Hoagie sandwich looks like. Your business will grow overnight."}
{"text":"This place is great. Saw the truck and food trucks are the thing these days so I stopped in, and what do you know  I know the kid that owns it he was friends with my son 25 years or so ago. Have been in a good number of times, and the food quality doesn't vary, always great. Cheesesteak, Italian beef, burgers, dogs, nachos, all the good food truck fair. All I can say glad I stopped. Now have brick and mortar at 112 E. Congress Ave. he said the truck will be back."}
{"text":"Ate there  for the first time tonight and had my first cheesesteak! It was delicious!! My son had the nachos and for 4.99 you get ALOT . DEFINETELY going back !"}
{"text":"Great service, good selection, reasonable prices and wonderful food! They didn't give me a napkin the last time I was there, which sucked, as I really needed them with the Italian beef I ordered - but, as it was about 40 degrees out, I appreciated them bringing my drink to my car instead of making me wait while they got it ready (I had called my order in, so the rest was already prepared)."}
