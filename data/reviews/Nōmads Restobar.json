{"text":"This restaurant was really good from start with an amazing cocktail to finish with a wonderful cheesecake, and the service was very good. I strongly recommend the place"}
{"text":"This place has the most diverse menu you can ask for with the name quite suited for its range in nationalities the food is inspired from. Our table had the chicken and waffles, guacamole, satay platter, Arancini, and the shrimp fried rice. Although we ate from what seemed like every part of the world, the food tasted like they would from a restaurant true to the origin - which is quite amazing! Everyone loved their food and had all thought we'd be back to try something else off the menu as we had trouble picking. The chicken and waffles definitely hit the spot for everyone and the rice was definitely to reorder as well. They have a great selection of cocktails and wine. We shall be back."}
{"text":"Note the review is based on a private event. Nice selection of beers and cocktails and wine. Great service and very willing to make recommendations. The munchies were great the guacamole in particular was memorable. Loved the dips and wings in general. Looking forward to the Port Credit opening!"}

{"text":"Nomads Restobar is amazing! Stumbled across this place in searching for brunch. My bf got the Eggs Benny. His favourite.  It was good but he wasn't a fan of how they prepared the ham. According to him, it tasted a little on the pickled side of things.   I ordered the market fresh omelette with herb potatoes and multi grain bread. Both our dishes had these potatoes and we agreed that we liked they were all different shapes. Most places have a standard cut on their home fries and one grows tired of the style. These were rather nice in flavour, & in texture.   I loved their multi grain bread.. it was delicious! it had some pumpkin seeds and grains that added to it for the better. It seemed like it was homemade. My omelette was the smoked salmon and chive. It was incredibly rich with so much for my taste buds to savour.   Their grapefruit juice was refreshing. Their coffee was a tad small, but you get free refills. So it was okay.   5 out of 5 stars.   I would definitely return.   I talked to my bf about the decor and found it interesting they have trains downstairs like a train station and a bicycle on the wall with skylines and city scape showcased on the walls upstairs. This reflects the title Nomads, as this symbolizes movement and also the food; inspired from around the world."}
{"text":"The menu is a very diverse blend of different cultures and flavours. Presentation and taste were solid. Drinks selection also good. A nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a week day during dinner hour. It was not busy. We got 3 items from the small plate/sharable menu and were pretty full after. The tacos were half price, it was a good deal. Food was delicious but they came rather slowly."}
