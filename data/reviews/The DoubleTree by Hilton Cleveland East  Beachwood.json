{"text":"I stayed here two nights and had no complaints. The lobby is huge and nice. Staff was friendly, there are plenty of meeting rooms, the business center is free and the bed is comfortable. The furnishings aren't typical Hilton but nice nonetheless and best of all, there is no charge for parking.  There is a fridge in the room and a subway and pf changs up the street. Another couple of blocks you will find more restaurants along with a fedex,verizon,and other businesses. there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a hotel shuttle which I'm sure will take you somewhere. Whenever I entered the hotel, I was greeted by someone which I thought was a nice touch.  The newspaper at my door wasn't a bad touch and although I didn't eat at the hotel, the prices didn't seem too crazy considering it's a Hilton. On weekends, there is a special of a pizza,salad and a pitcher of soda for 13.00.   I can't think of any complaints but I didn't eat in the restaurants or sauna or pool."}
{"text":"Awful. Reception was rude and unhelpful. Breakfast was mediocre. Both nights we stayed it was incredibly loud due to other guests. Would not stay again."}
{"text":"Most of reviews here are well over a year old, and after a pleasant stay here very recently I felt compelled to write an up-to-date review. Yes, I have stayed here twice before and I remember how dingy it used to be - but this is no longer the case. They have put in new carpets in the rooms and the hallways, and the room and bathroom are decked out with new wallpapers, marble countertops, and tasteful furniture/linens. The fitness center has newer, higher-end machines, and the pool area was completely deserted (perhaps because I stayed on a Thursday night and not over the weekend). The only thing I can agree with the previous reviewers is that the walls still seem to be a little thin, but luckily my neighbors were considerate of others and were not loud at all. The only way I could tell they were thin was because I could hear it every time someone flushed the toilet. I think the hotel now deserves the 3.5-star rating and I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Took the kids to go swimming in the pool and it was so cold that the kids couldn't even get in. Then that night when we returned to our room it had not been cleaned/ serviced."}
{"text":"Don't stay here!!!!!   We checked in at midnight and walked into a freezing cold room on one of the coldest nights of the year.  We attempted to turn on the heat but when it never came on we called the front desk.  A rude women answered the phone and told me to wait for it to kick on.  I'd already waited and it never did.  (Shouldn't it be on when I arrive?!?) needless to say, they sent someone up and we went to sleep thinking it was fixed.  Much to our dismay we froze all night because the heat NEVER came on!!!!(see pics)  I then walked on the freezing cold floor to the shower and looked up to find BLACK MOLD (see pics) on the bathroom ceiling.  We dressed quickly for a nice event and my husband when to share our complaints with the front desk.  They didn't have a manager to listen to him and we had to leave.  We came back after our event and still no manager. We are now home and keep calling but no one will call us back!  The icing  on the cake.. They charged us twice!!!!  We shouldn't be paying for that horrible experience at all, let alone twice!!!  To the manager- we are waiting for you call and will edit this post to reflect how many times you ignore us until you call us back!   I would like to add that I usually like to discuss my concerns with a manager and give them a chance to rectify a poor experience before I post a negative review but I can't because they won't call me back!  I've left 2 messages and stopped in to leave my number.  Each time a staff member guaranteed me that some would return my call... I'm still waiting!"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place but it's luck of the draw on neighbors. I changed rooms because of a loud party only to be placed next to another loud person. I think the walls are too thin. It's frustrating.  The staff is nice & everything is clean."}
{"text":"Imagine this experience. Manager by the name of Chris checks you in. You highly anticipate a famous Double Tree chocolate chip cookie. The \"care bags\" are sitting right on the counter behind the desk. Chris gives you shoddy directions to the worst room in the hotel adjacent to the first level parking lot. No cookies? No welcome bag? That is just the start. I returned to the desk to request a different room. This time I spoke to a young lady, requested the cookies. I received a different room. Yet this time there is a visible dirt stain on the pillow case, and the sheets were wrinkled as if they were used for a night. By this time I request room 3...on the 3rd floor. Day 2, after a long day away from the hotel, the room was not cleaned. The tip for housekeeping was still there. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. So requested towels and toiletries. Day 3, long day away from the hotel. Again, I returned to the same room. It was not reset, no cleaned towels. Tip for housekeeping, still there. I went to the front desk and they offered me the room directly across. Guess what? That room was dirty...messy beds, towels on the bathroom floor. Now I am checking out and the hotel manager Chris does not have the decency to leave his \"corporate\" meeting to address my concerns. I have an average of 2,000 readers per TripAdvisor review, so stay tuned Double Tree Beachwood for more bad press."}
{"text":"The staff and cleaning people are super great. But Hilton needs to spend some money on this place. It's older and seems wore out. What drove me crazy was how thin the walls are, I could hear phone conversations, toilets flushing, and the guy snoring all night. Won't be stopping here anymore.    They also forgot to give me hilton points for my stay. This hotel is only interested in catering to large groups."}
{"text":"Stayed at this location from 22 August 2016 to 02 September 2016.  Employees friendly but issues with service and upkeep of hotel.  I submitted a firm to be added to their rewards program and it was not done.  Housekeeping regularly did not replace used glasses, ice cooler liner or towels on floor even after complaining to management.  Lobby and restaurant appear renovated but other areas do not. Carpets in halls heavily stained and worn/ripped in areas. Rooms have not been updated and are dated looking.  Beds are ok but not great.  Breakfast buffet is very tasty but service is very slow at times.  Could also use a make it yourself waffle iron.  Restaurant is a bit pricey for the quality.  Pool is a nice size but was dirty and tiles are falling off the sides.  Pool chairs are comfortable and in good shape.  Hot tub was clean and in good shape."}
{"text":"Bed...so comfy...  Room...so clean.  This is by no means the nicest Hilton I've stayed at, but it's pretty good.  It's immediately adjacent to the highway around a bunch of other hotels in an office-park type setting.  Not bad."}
{"text":"After a big disappointment with the Doubletree in Independence, I decided to relocate here for the remainder of my stay.  Overall I would say this was a better experience. The amenities were far better (which always helps) including an executive lounge, larger gym, pool area and, although it was probably the same age as the Independence location, it just felt better maintained.  My room was clean and generally the standard, newer room style with dream bed, large TV, wireless, etc. I ordered room service on a few occasions and it was fast, as ordered and the service was friendly. I had breakfast and dinner in the lobby restaurant. Food was good (not great) and therefore slightly overpriced for dinner.  My biggest issue was that this restaurant turned into a night club of sorts on weekend evenings with non-guests coming and going, loud music pumping out, etc. It just felt odd walking into my hotel while large groups were hanging outside smoking or in the lobby on their phones who weren't actually staying there.  Outside of this it's a decent hotel with no serious issues."}
{"text":"I think this is a solid 3.5 star hotel.  Can get it for around $50  per night on priceline.  The walls are pretty thin, def. ask for a room away from the elevator.  The pool can get crowded, but I think that's to be expected at any hotel with a pool during the summer.  One cool feature of the pool is that you can swim from the inside of the building to the outside.  The decor is nice, the room had granite countertops in the bathroom and granite on the nightstands.  Not deluxe, by any means, but a very comfortable stay."}
{"text":"What a terrible place. Tube televisions... Dark and dank rooms. Extremely busy somehow. Had a 24 hour cancellation policy which isn't convenient. Depressing place for a business traveller. Never again."}
{"text":"Do not stay here!!! I had nothing but problems during my stay here. The rooms are gross! Not only is the decor ugly and dated, the rooms are filthy. Not sure when it was last re-modeled, but I am going to guess some time in the 80's. The carpet, bed, and towels were all stained and the room smelled weird.  During my stay here, the cleaning staff was constantly pestering us. They ignored the do not disturb sign and were constantly knocking on the door. I don't understand why they were trying so hard to get in... it's not like they actually cleaned up when they were in there.  Don't trust the pictures on their site. They are misleading and make it look a lot nicer than it really is. Cleveland is full of nice hotels; just not this one. Next time, I think I'll try the one accross the street. That one looked nice."}
{"text":"OK... seems that there are two things set up in yelp for the same place... so copying my review...  I'm a big fan of the Hilton Chain, and this Hilton definitely delivers for a Hilton hotel property. I'm going to start this review acknowledging that this place has a couple of bad reviews... however most of them are pretty dated (over 2 years ago). This place has undergone some renovations and the resulting property is pretty nice!  The hotel rooms are comfy, spacious and exactly what I expect out of a Hilton. The indoor swimming pool is nice, as is the whirlpool. Room service is courteous, prompt and friendly. Good breakfast - french toast was only ok though.   Definitely a place I would stay again."}
{"text":"This past weekend I stayed at this hotel with my family in order to celebrate graduation.   The hotel is adorable and large. There is a bar, restaurant, pool, and hot tub on site. They also offer to shuttle you anywhere within a 5 mile radius which I thought was super cool!   Upon checking in, we were greeted by extremely friendly staff. They gave us all cookies that were very good and a happy surprise!   Our room was spacious and clean. Breakfast the next morning was delicious. Every staff member we ran into was friendly. Parking is ample! If I'm ever going to need to stay on the east side again, I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the worst well named hotels I've been to. It was quite sad because I was stuck here for 4 weeks total 2-2 week intervals. Very slow unprofessional service. I felt like I was stuck in the early 90s my entire time here. Designs are not like the typical Hilton's it feels much older. On both occasions during check-in there was something missing in the room. For the price my company paid for me to stay here definitely not worthwhile."}
{"text":"The best part of this hotel is definitely the friendly staff. They are great. The gym and pool is a plus here as well. The only downside is the heat in the room. No matter what temperature I have it set to, it did not want to go above 68. After a few days of staying here it finally hit 70. But overall a good place to stay."}
{"text":"A miserable experience.  Heat doesn't work; hotel is run down; the exercise room had a bucket where it captured water from drenched ceiling tiles.  Came back to a dead TV remote. I'm a road warrior who doesn't need fancy but does need clean and reliable.  This hotel is neither. Needs some serious upgrading TLC."}
{"text":"This was the overflow hotel for a family reunion I attended.  The hotel itself was ok, but nothing special.  The bathroom is extremely small, but it was clean.  One major downside for me is that I couldn't control my own room temperature.  It was set to an automatic timer and was very loud when it cut on and off, so I didn't sleep well.  The pillows weren't very comfortable to me either.  I was also not happy with the $16 charge for the buffet breakfast, but it's their fee.  I just opted to go somewhere else.  Overall, if I had to stay here again, I would, but I would definitely speak up about the conditions in regards to the temperature in the room."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work so I feel 'in the know' with what to expect from your standard Hiltons, Marriotts, etc, but this place was pretty sad for a Hiton.  I normally wouldn't stay at this hotel but my little brother was graduating from John Carroll last weekend, so we decided to give it a shot.  I honestly don't have anything positive to say about it other than the location is OK.  Our room was dark and dated, the walls were thin (we listened to blasting music until 3am because a local HS prom was hosted there - obviously these kids were our neighbors), our bathtub was clogged, the morning breakfast buffet looked unkept and much of the food was completely unappetizing, and on the day we were set to check out, I noticed that our bathroom ceiling was dripping water (unsure what that was all about.)  Honestly, I'd recommend anyone to stay somewhere else.  If the Hilton Family was aware that one of their hotels was in this shape, they'd likely remove the 'Hilton' from the title.  (I should have known what we were in for - only half the letters of the Hilton sign were illuminated from the 271 - definitely a sign of things yet to come.)"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service from checking in, meeting the super friendly cookie man, to the bartender's friendliness, to the waiter in restaurant that gave me change, and lastly the Host in restaurant incredible prompt and inviting follow through on take out. This will always be my home away from home while on business!"}
{"text":"The worst Doubletree I have stayed in ( in hotels 40+ weeks a year). First got my room and the door was wide open. The deadbolt could not be retracted, to close the door. Lugged my luggage back to front desk and the receptionist proceeded to give me detail instructions to solve the problem.... Nope I don't think so. I got a new room. First thing I noticed was wall paper falling off the wall in the hallway. Room seemed musky. Went to the gym and road the bike, the TV was broken. Went to shower and there were hairs on my towel. Ordered steak for room service and it was actually good. TV was not working my first 2 nights. If it rains cable/satellite does not work. They did offer me a free movie. The restaurant is closed so breakfast is in a conference room and dinner is poolside. At breakfast I asked for soy milk or non dairy creamer. There was none. Also asked for peanut butter at breakfast and the server looked at me like I was crazy. A co worker got to her room and her water and snacks waiting for her were open and half gone. As a diamond memener I was not put on the hilton honors floor, nor was I told they had a honors lounge. I will not stay at this hotel again by choice."}
{"text":"This is the kind of hotel that looks decent at first but then you notice a lot of problems and realize you probably shouldnt have come here.  First room smelled like chlorine, requested a change. 2nd room had lots of rust particles on bathtub floor. And it showed up again. Shower drain was too slow, maybe clogged with rust bits. Maybe the hot water heater needs to be replaced.  Stepped on tiny glass shard in room, some bleeding but thankfully didnt stay in foot. Older carpets.  Front desk computer system went down, long lines of unhappy people. Another reviewer complained of bedbugs, dont know if true.  I am tired of doubletree, its the most inconsistent hotel brand in america. If it doesnt have at least 3.5 stars on yelp, would avoid. This one had 2.5 stars, and another one i didnt like had three stars.  Positives were a beautiful pool, nice exercise room ellipticals, convenient location off highway."}
{"text":"Stay here a lot when I am in town and have been here for many meetings held at this hotel."}
{"text":"We stayed at this hotel because we stayed in the past and had a pretty good experience during our last stay. This stay was completely different. First, the cons. Bathroom cons are as follows, door does not lock or completely shut, dried blood on our shower curtain (multiple areas), dirty bathroom walls, visible disgusting pipes under sink where they keep your \"clean towels\", and dirty towels in the \"clean pile\".  Main bedroom area cons, no microwave, giant tear in the curtains, weird thermostat that does nothing. Pool area: no working hot tub and 10 clean towels at 7AM. Breakfast buffet: not really a giant selection and priced around $15-$16 per person. 4th floor vending area: expired pop in vending machine and mystery green slime growing on outside of ice machine.   Bathroom pros: there is a toilet.  Main bedroom area pros: there is a coffee machine, safe, tv, and a giant desk. Pool area cons: ample amount of chairs. Breakfast buffet: Patti was super nice and there is a gentleman who makes eggs/omelets to order. 4th floor vending: no pros."}
{"text":"Whoa, lot's of hating on this place! It's not actually that bad, guys! -- not that much worse than any of the other 6 hotels on this road anyway.  My only issue here was that my first non-smoking room REEKED of smoke to start out with -- I literally walked in, walked right back out and down to the lobby to ask for another room. I usually hate being difficult and demanding like that, but this was really not OK. Clearly, there's still something funky going on with the ventilation (or lack thereof?) that needs some looking at. Though. the lobby staff weren't thrilled about it, but weren't exactly surprised either, and were quick to set me up with another room -- which was just fine, and actually smoke free.  This other room was great, featuring some of the most comfy bedding and soft towels I've had at a hotel -- like seriously super plushy bunny rabbit soft! Welcome treat to a sore traveler's face! Or feet. Or you know.  Hotel bar is a typical overpriced Hilton bar, but the free breakfast with to-order omelets and other treats was a welcome change from the usual industrial serving of pre-scrambled eggs. God awful coffee at breakfast though, but passable cuppa in the rooms.  The staff certainly aren't happy about you staying here, but you know what, I'd stay here again, if only to cuddle with those towels."}
{"text":"Many of us consultants stay here weekly yet I was refused a late checkout for an hour later than the usual time. So much for the \"Careline\". They could have cleaned my room last! Oh well will be spreading the bad news to my colleagues! Marriott never refuses and usually extends up to 4 hours if needed!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here over a weekend and found it to be fine. Comfy room. Service was adequate. Mostly chose it for the location.   We also ate here for Christmas and it was good. Our waitress was superb and made us feel highly valued!   We also frequented the bar often enough during our brief stay that the bartender knew our drinks and had them ready for us almost the instant we sat down.   So, great service from the staff in the restaurant and bar, and ok to good service from housekeeping. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I can't agree with these other reviews.  I stayed at this hotel last weekend, and found it to be quite nice.  Excellent service from the staff, I was able to hold my room due to a late check in with no problems.  The room was clean and up to date, plenty of hot water and the maid service was fine.  I did note that a few trim items needed a little attention, chips or scratches in the elevator, but nothing to worry about.  I was staying on the top floor, and had no issues whatsoever with the elevator even though the hotel was pretty well booked this weekend.  What really stood out in my mind tho, were the exercise facilities and the pool.  The gym was one of the nicest I have seen in a moderately priced hotel, with enough room and equipment for several people to work out at the same time.  I got a big kick out of the pool, which was indoor/outdoor, where you could actually swim through a open door in the pool to the outside pool and back."}
{"text":"We booked a room at this hotel on Expedia.  On checking in, there was blonde hair all over the shower- my fiance and I are both dark haired.  I let it slide, however, upon returning to our room after going out for the evening, there were ants all over the bathroom floor and in a few other corners of the room.  We called down to the manager who gave us a new, ant free room.  This was acceptable, but what a pain in the ass to pack up all our stuff and move at midnight!  They didn't really seem upset that we complained- I don't think I even heard an apology.  When checking out, after speaking to the manager on duty we were offered free brunch but we were unable to stay as we had prior engagements.  The manager gave us her card and asked us to call her to set up a complimentary stay in the future, but I doubt that will happen."}
{"text":"Stayed here for our first anniversary using a Groupon code. The front desk clerks were argumentative about the groupon deal and kept sending me to the business center for me to make my own reservations when there was nobody else waiting to be helped. After about a 15 minute exchange, they finally just made the reservation at the front desk. They were short with me and rude. Did not seem to have the same standard of customer service i have come to expect from other Hilton hotels. Very disappointed with our treatment from the front desk staff."}
{"text":"Nice rooms, great central location, nice breakfast in the morning."}
{"text":"I had to stay here one night because Embassy Suites oversold their rooms and sent me there; I was so disappointed! I had to crack the window open all night due to the obnoxious train-like sound it made when it was closed. This resulted in a bunch of flies coming into the room.   The towels were stained. The rooms overall looked old and worn, but with newer furniture. It looked like someone was trying to put a bandaid on to make it better, but this whole hotel needs a serious makeover.   The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice, and the staff were friendly. Just not what I would call comparable to the other hotels in the area."}
{"text":"I stay here often for work and it is not my preference as it is a busy place and frequently loud, this means if you want sleep go elsewhere!  They frequently host many conferences, sports teams (local), the bar is a busy place for locals, and they have a lot, I mean a lot of weddings!  Beyond all the above they have renovated most of the rooms and with my Hilton status I usually get the executive floor...this does not translate however into a quieter floor!  This probably makes me sound old...I am not and that should tell you how loud it gets even when I come back at 2am after hitting downtown!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for my business.  But my stay last night at this hotel was exceptional.  ALL of the people working there were polite, friendly and helpful.  What a delight.  Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Checked into the worlds smallest king size suite. You could not shut the bathroom door and use the commode it was that close of quarters. The room was run down and in desperate need of updating...a half hearted fix at popcorn cieling from an old water leak in the cieling as well as missing concrete, screw pops in the walls, tattered lamp shades and questionable cleaning of the room...You could hear the upstairs guest shift in their bed and all plumbing sounds too this was followed by running children in the hall after 11:30pm and the discovery of ants under our pets water bowl that we put down when we got back at 10pm that night. While the staff was polite and helpful the building is in awful shape and not something I expect from Hilton...SAD! There is more but I think this gets the point across. Almost forgot to mention the gorilla tape on the window to keep the breeze out and less than stable wifi free or not!"}
{"text":"At first glance this hotel seemed fine. Strange layout meant a 10 minute walk to find our room but when we eventually found it, Our room was clean enough, the bathroom is functional, albeit tiny. As it is a doubletree, you get a cookie when you check in. That about ends the positive.   We were at this hotel for the sole purpose of sleeping (our two kids under age 3 staying at my parents and not enough bedrooms = air mattress...not ideal for an already tired mom and dad). We checked in at 9 and despite the paper thin walls that let you hear every sound from the hall and surrounding rooms, we were passed out before 10 pm.   And then at 1 am, we were woken by the fire alarm blaring at maximum volume. Cue middle of the night evacuation with zero check-ins from staff to advise whether there was indeed a fire, when we could re-enter, nothing. We sat outside for over 30 minutes until word trickled around the weirdly shaped long building that we could re-enter and get back to our room after what turned out to be a false alarm. And of course by now we are wide awake, freezing and pretty damn annoyed.   It took us well over an hour (more for my husband) to fall back asleep, and just in time for our alarm to go off a couple hours later so we could get in a car and drive 6.5 hours back home (with two kids who of course slept through just fine for my parents). FML.   We booked through Priceline and through them, we tried to negotiate some sort of refund for the inconvenience and the best they could do was $10. Ten. Dollars. That is what the hotel offered and Priceline wouldn't push them further for anything more. (Consider this a secondary crap review for Priceline). We booked the hotel at 4 pm so it would have otherwise been empty and I don't know what the cost for them to change one set of sheets and wipe off a sink is, but wow. Underwhelming way to handle an awful situation.   I wouldn't expect anything better than the absolute bare minimum from this less-than-mediocre hotel."}
{"text":"The Double Tree by Hilton is my favorite place to stay when I travel to Ohio.  The area in Beachwood off of Chagrin Blvd is the best.  Every restaurant or retail store you can think of is just a short drive away.  I love the area and the free parking and wifi from the Double.  The rooms are great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this hotel any stars. By far the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. My non smoking room was right next to a smoking room which pretty much negated the fact that I was in a non smoking room. The staff were alright but definitely not going out of their way to help you. The wifi didn't work. The bathroom was dirty. It's not convenient. I could go on and on. DON'T STAY HERE."}
{"text":"Everyone is cheerful and friendly, from housekeeping to concierge.  Room was clean, comfortable, and equipped with all my needs - desk, iron, hair dryer, toiletries, etc...   Very happy with these accommodations!"}
{"text":"Things must have changed a lot here since 2007 when those very bad reviews were posted.   It's obviously not a Hilton-built hotel... my guess is that it was built a Mariott.  But the rooms are very clean and well-furnished.  Bedding and amenities like the inroom coffeemaker are Hilton-standard.  I had one dinner in the bar; a nice steak but nothing spectacular.   The shuttle got me to work every day and every evening (about 5 miles from the hotel);  no problems with that.   Good thing that they've got the restaurant, as you'd have to drive for miles to find another one.  WiFi works great, decent restaurant, and a soft bed;  that's all I need for my business trips.   I dig the new automated check-in kiosk; no waiting in line !  Don't be put off by those lousy reviews.   The Hilton Beachwood is a perfectly good place to lay your head when you're in eastern Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stayed here due to my usual hotel being sold out during the week I was traveling. Not overly impressed - small room, lopsided bed, tiny bathroom. Breakfast just ok - crazy busy between 700-730 am - the line just to be seated was 8 deep when I arrived on two occasions of my four night stay. Staff friendly enough. Easy access to the highway."}
{"text":"I've been staying in more hotels than I would like over the past few weeks, so I feel like I've got a decent feel for what's good & what's not so good.   The good:  $$ - Although in Beachwood (which is very expensive), the hotel was reasonably priced ($75 a night via hotwire).   The Bad:  The room was smaller than any of the Marriotts or other affiliates (hampton, holiday inn, millenium, etc).  The service was below par -  I came back from work on Friday at 3:00 p.m. & the room still hadn't been cleaned yet (which doesn't really matter, but is expected).  The breakfast bar was $15 a person, which seems a little steep. If you're in town & you need a decent place to stay, don't feel like this place should be avoided.  That said, don't go out of your way to stay here."}
{"text":"One star for the facelift! One star for the attempt to create a cool bar menu.  That's all I can spare.  Sadly no points for the weird old school jazz that played too loudly at the bar. We could barely hear each other over the Boney James saxophone!! Menu reads handcrafted but bar tenders not trained to make the drinks properly.  I was overwhelmed with St Germaine/ elderflower and it was not an ingredient included in the drink description on the menu of the drink I ordered. Stick with a drink up or wine."}
{"text":"Visiting for a one day conference. I did not stay at hotel, but used conference rooms, and restrooms. Cleaning is not their strength. I've been in outhouses cleaner than this bathroom. So disgusting. Over flowing garbage, dirty floors, broken towel, soap, and out of order toilets. My advice....hold it!"}
{"text":"This hotel has bed bugs FYI. And this is the second time I've felt compelled to write a review on Yelp. (I will attach photos)  I booked a commercial (I'm an actress) for a Lebron James Nike Commercial which was filming in Ohio. I traveled from LA to Ohio on Tuesday, October 20, 2015. I checked in to the Double Tree on Wednesday morning at 6am. When I walked into my room my first impression was it felt dirty and unclean. The first thing I saw when I opened the door to my bathroom was toilet paper floating in the toilet bowl- which was nasty, however I flushed it. I only had 3 hours to sleep before my call time so I fell asleep with boxers on and no t-shirt.  Worked a full day on Wednesday, October 21 and came back to the hotel after dinner to rest before my flight the next day.. in the same attire as the night before: boxers and no t-shirt.   Friday, October 23 when I was back home in LA I started to notice little bumps and rashes break out on my arms, neck, and stomach.  Over the weekend I started feeling like I was coming down with an illness and fever.  On Sunday I took photos of my body and realized something was terribly wrong. I had bumps all over my body except my higher thigh and butt region... I had never had bedbugs before but I knew this was that! Long story short, I had my management get in contact with a bed bug attorney to contact the health inspectors in Ohio to check the Double Tree however by the time all of that got around the beds were \"apparently\" changed and it was too late (I didn't take legal action until a month or so after the fact- which is my fault and is why I feel like I had to write this review.)  In addition to myself getting bed bugs, another actor who was working on the same job, staying in the same hotel got bed bugs.  Since I act and model for a living I lost money from not being able to work gigs. It took 3 1/2 months for all the bites to finally heal and my skin to finally become kind of one pigment again. It was emotionally draining and definitely made me feel self conscious.... I would hate for anyone to have gone through what I went through.  Moral of the story, this particular Double Tree Hilton is old and filthy- so I would suggest you to NOT stay here.  Just because you change the beds doesn't mean the bed bugs disappear they also live in carpet and many other areas.  Anyways, I'm attaching photos of the bites and the process of the 3 months in which it took for them to heal.  Now when I go to a hotel I never not wear a shirt to bed- I am fully dressed lol and if I sense any cleanliness issues I change rooms or hotels immediately. Hope this saves anyone from experiencing what I had to go through.   Contact email: KatJPasion@gmail.com"}
{"text":"So I don't give out 1 star reviews often, so it has to be pretty bad in order for me to sink that low.  I have a pretty profound respect for Hilton and prefer to stay at their hotels whenever travelling.  I ended up here as a work conference I was attending happened to be held in the conference rooms here and blocks were reserved for us by my company here.  I'd heard stories over the years about this hotel and was a bit leery when I learned this was going to be our venue for the week.    I checked in around 8pm on a Monday night and when I asked for a high floor, I was told that the entire hotel only had 1 king room available and it was on the second floor.  This perplexed me a bit as this is a 7 story hotel and is massive, but whatever, if nothing is available then so be it.  Walking up to the elevators, only one was operational through my entire stay as it appears the other was out of order and there was no fix for an entire week.  I stepped off the elevator into what seemed like a Laundromat as the floor's laundry facility is the first thing you see as you step off the elevator and there is no a/c or ventilation in the hallway so it felt as if my stay would be occurring in a Laundromat.  Walking into my room, it was humid and the thermostat was on 69.5 degrees.  I thought maybe I was in Europe where the a/c shuts off when no one is in the room so I'd give it some time to cool off.  I began to unpack and walked into the bathroom to see the nasty residue by the tub and on the wall vent.  I didn't have much of a choice at this rate as I would be here all week and there were supposedly no other rooms available.  The next morning I went down to the gym facility and initially thought it looked up to speed.  One thing I did notice is that the thermostat was at 78, which shocked me for being in a workout room.  I got on an elliptical and as I began to use it, the entire thing was wobbling like it was about to fall apart.  Upon closer inspection it appeared all of the equipment and machines in the gym were corroded and rusted.  The treadmill I decided on after also had a quirky touchscreen controller so my workout, needless to say, wasn't the best.    The event facilities did live up to a DoubleTree/Hilton standard and were very inviting.  The staff also seemed accommodating to all of our needs during our conference days.  However, going back to my initial and biggest complaint of the temperature in my room, it never got below 78 degrees no matter how low the thermostat was set.  On the third day of my stay, I was relieved for one of my co-workers to also comment on the same temperature issue of their room and felt vindicated that I did actually know how to work the thermostat and that it was indeed a massive temperature control issue in this hotel.  I'm not to sure of how this place still has a Hilton or a DoubleTree designation given the state of disrepair it's in, but I know I would not voluntarily ever stay at this property again.  There are plenty of other Hilton properties around this one and they all appear to be in better shape, so make sure to choose wisely before deciding on this one."}
{"text":"Nice staff tries hard, Decent restaurant & bar, pool & exercise room OK, but had a debacle on check-in, perhaps due to Expedia. Also, tub was clogged, sink was clogged; told front desk on checkout and they hardly seemed to care; they forgot to leave towels in room and it took two phone calls to get them."}
{"text":"I would give this business 0 stars if that was an option.  It is unclean and not well kept.  The floors are sticky and dirty (I pointed it out to the manager and was told that they are understaffed) The trash is over flowing in the lobby/gym.  There are no gym wipes. The carpets are not vacuumed and there are big stains.  When I pointed it out the filthy mess I was told housekeeping isnt staffed until 10am each morning) Each evening we had to call to ask for towels - none were left in the room. I asked for a cookie one evening and I was told they didn't have any.  I questioned why that was and I was told they could not predict how many people were staying in the hotel so they could not plan accordingly.  That is the problem.  The manager is unhappy with his job and unaware of the number of guests and can not staff/plan accordingly.  Naturally the place is a mess."}
{"text":"This place is now a Doubletree by Hilton by the way. Stayed at this place many times and I've always had good experiences. The staff is friendly, the hotel is clean and the beds are comfy. Normally I would think of this place as 4-stars but something happened that changed my mind:  Last night the people above us were being incredibly loud so I called the front desk to take care of it and it was handled in a matter of minutes. The next day, the hotel assistant manager called me personally to apologize and gave me free breakfast and a free night at the hotel on a future date! I was shocked at the level of professionalism and courtesy - I've never had someone care so much about the customer before!"}
{"text":"Stayed here on a biz trip last week. The rooms a clean, but everything else is wrong with this hotel:  1) the shuttle driver HIT one of my friends with 8 witnesses and the hotel manager acted dismissive, as though nothing had happened --- didn't apologize, or offer to comp her room... NOTHING! We filed a police report, which seemed to make them a little nervous though --- good to formalize these things... 2) Wifi so slow I couldn't use it during peak hours at all 3) Terrible customer service --- everyone acts like they are on drugs or just missing some serious brain cells 4) Terrible restaurant, with horrific customer service --- our waiter was extremely rude and incompetent and the manager took my friend's drink that was full and sitting in front of her then tried to give her the same glass after taking it out of her site --- not legal --- and when she protested he starting yelling at her! No joke... this was a total twilight zone moment!  Do not stay here if you can avoid it."}
{"text":"My recent stay at your hotel did not meet my expectations. The rooms were okay, the bathroom is very small and the bar area was nice including the customer service at the bar. However, my issue was at check in where we were assigned a room that air conditioning issues. I realize that some things are beyond your control, however the way they are addressed is the key. I am the customer, I am paying for room and I selected the Doubletree by Hilton for what the name represents. They sent me maintenance rather than changing out my room! I have to request a new room twice which is unacceptable. I wasted an hour and a half of my time which should have been addressed right away."}
{"text":"I attended a conference here and found the hotel lacking in quality and cleanliness. The property is worn down, carpets in hallways are filthy, the elevator was sluggish and making strange sounds. The conference accommodations were very average. Conference seating was worn metal chairs crammed into small spaces. I was scheduled to have a breakfast, luncheon, banquet and brunch the following day. Breakfast was uninspired. The coffee pedestrian, the cubed breakfast potatoes spongy, the muffin dry-definitely not fresh. The orange juice was good! All this and we were seated 10 at a table for 8. When lunchtime came I took my growling stomach to the buffet table only to find bag-o-salad with some cut up veggies, the remains of a pasta salad, what had been a bowl of chips, unmarked sandwiches, and a lady ladling soup...waiting for more soup. The seats again set 10 to a table were all occupied or saved (gotta love that) so I took my plate out of the hall and found a random table. Of course because I was not sitting in the dining hall I had no placesetting. I scrounged around and then realized there might be forks at the serve-yourself dessert table-eureka! I ate a bit more of the lunch. And I bussed my own plate, returning it to the staff in the hall. You may be relieved that you'll be spared details about the other two meals because I left the conference soon after and even paid for the second night's stay rather than face the prospect of more bad food in a lackluster conference setting. I regret now that I did not take a photo of the hallway as I left my room: there were piles of dirty laundry, trash and room service trays littering the length of it."}
{"text":"Where to start... Oh, I know - on night two, I discovered what appeared to be old, dried vomit on the back of one of my \"clean\" pillows following a visit from housekeeping.  The woman at the front desk wasn't blatantly rude about the incident but offered no shock or empathy.  Perhaps this is not the first time she's encountered dried vomit on a guest's pillow... They did provide me with a $25 gift card to their restaurant or room service later on, which was a nice gesture.  I also received a voice mail from a manager (who notated in the message that he was aware I was in training at the time of his call -- convenient).  However, my 4 attempts to call him back went unanswered... I was there for training with work - a company that provides quite a lot of business to this hotel.  I surely hope they plan on improving their conditions because I know I was not the only employee dissatisfied with the conditions of the rooms.    Thankfully, they appear to be in the early stages of renovating this hotel.  It is in dire need of renovations to the rooms.  In regards to the rooms - other than the \"puke pillow\", the AC was fairly inefficient and the shower water  would build up in the tub to at least an inch or so of standing water when taking showers.    On the flip side, they did provide a breakfast buffet every morning (though they typically charge $16 for this apparently, and it's worth about $9-10 at most), they had an OKAY gym for a hotel, the pool area was nice, and the staff was mostly friendly and helpful.    Taking all of this into consideration, if my company decides to send me to this hotel for any reason in the future...I may just decide to pay for my own hotel out-of-pocket...I would never stay here again.  Steer clear if you can!"}
{"text":"I expected this hotel to be on the nicer side, but in fact it really wasn't the best at all.  First of all, the front desk was very understaffed.  I tried to call the front desk and it rang and rang and rang, and I had to call back three times to get through.  Second of all, the lobby was really far from where the rooms were.  And finally, the room was a little shabby.  I've stayed at nicer Holiday Inn Express hotels.  If it had been $60 a night instead of $150 a night I would have liked it better.  I don't recommend this hotel - stay at the Hampton Inn or any one of the other nice hotels just off the highway in Beachwood."}
{"text":"This by far was the worst stay at a hotel i've ever had. They actually put me on a floor where they were remodeling and noone for the entire weekend cleaned up after themselves. construction equipment all in the hallways. I puposely went there so that my dughters could swim. I had heard that the Hilton was the best. Well the pool was out of service, not to mention that I asked before booking the room. We had to get on a bus and go down the street to the embassy hotel to swim, then wait for the bus to come back and get us whenever thay had time. The only real help we had was the bell hop. he was very informative and curtious. He really should be at a 5 star hotel, not that hole in the wall. Then someone tell me why the floor i was on was suppose to be non-smoking and it smelled like months of smoking.Then the service at the restaraunt sucked too. Only one waitress to serve approx. 8 tables. We waited about an hour to eat. Oh did i mention it was obvious that the didnt like the color of my skin. A couple came in after us by about 20 minutes and was served and paid before we got our food. Either way, no chance in hell they'll get any money from me again. The Hilton family should be shamed. I'd rather stay at the Days Inn or a cheap motel, At least they try to give 5 star service."}
{"text":"All my hotel reviews including quality and price analysis.  Most of the time I feel like you get what you pay for.  Sometimes you don't.  In terms of this hotel, I thought it exceeded my expectations based on it's price point and brand name.  Excellent customer service from the start.  I was in Cleveland for a wedding and needed to check in a little early and that was a smooth transition.  Of course I took advantage of the free cookies that every Double Tree gives out.    Room was exceptionally clean.  I know other reviews have criticized the cleanliness but I was more than satisfied with the room.  Bed was extremely comfortable to the point I almost was late to the wedding.  Nice hot shower and I didn't have any complaints on the noise or anything.  My only cons were the deposit charge.  I feel like $100 hold is a little much for this hotel and I wish the restaurant was open before 5pm.  They do have room service however.  Besides that, I'd stay here again."}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly and super helpful! Room is great. Front desk staff at night are wonderfully awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm going to list my issues with this hotel below in a manageable why so I don't sound like a psycho  Quick synopsis -I went for a wedding, billing was a mess, staff could give less then a crap, and really I expected better for a Hilton. Bottom line : The best part of the hotel ASIDE from the great wedding ( which was not at the hotel) was the little bottle in the bathroom of Peter Thomas Roth lotion. 1-when calling this hotel you get funneled into a general call center , I'm all for diversity but if the person I'm speaking with and I cannot understand each other to the point of misspelling my easy 6 letter last name.Please have your customer reps speak English fluently. 2- when I call back through the general call center to make a change my room a few weeks later, I wanted to go from one suite to two adjoining rooms, after trying the call center I got frustrated said goodbye due to language differences and spoke the hotel operator who gave me to the night manager, who bent over backwards to MESS UP MY RESERVATION.He was kind enough to secure for my party two suites adjoining, at $700.00 for one night. And no ,not one person I spoke to could talk something comparable off our rooms like they would had I gone with the regular room rate with the bridal party.  3-one week prior to the wedding I call to get my room total due to splitting price with friends, and I find out bout the 700.00 bill and the adjoining suites.At this point I lose my head , speak to some one in sales , explain my name is still not correct (each time I call no one can find my reservation, until I spell my name incorrectly) , the two suites are in correct. Sales said they would take care of everything. Fixed my name, to adjoining regular rooms etc.  4 -Upon arrival - name STILL wrong leads to check in confusion. Total of bill wrong for correct room choice, when asked for receipt front desk says I don't need one, does not explain difference in bill total. The gal is too busy talking on a personal call, doesn't give me check in bag from bride and groom until I'm boarding the shuttle to wedding service!!!!!  5 - As I was leaving this hell hole, I had my overnight bag, and tote over my shoulder with a friend with about the same luggage in the elevator. We reached the bottom floor attempted to vacate the elevator , but couldn't because a bellboy with food stuffs barged in and huffed and puffed when we asked to leave the elevator.   Final thoughts- The bill did get sorted, but frankly the complete visit from beginning to end really was stressful and not what I thought a stay in a Hilton hotel would be like. Nothing at all but confusion and terrible service. The rooms were clean but nothing special. I will never ever stay in a Hilton Hotel ever ever ever again!"}
{"text":"The hotel and restaurant were both a big disappointment. The rooms are nothing special. The bathroom is very small. The housekeeping people are really loud and obnoxious while they are working on nearby rooms. They managed to loss a credit card in the welcome desk somehow!?! Never seen that before in my life. Even little things like having no hot water for the tea out front. The restaurant is overpriced, understaffed, terrible service and mediocre food. They also said they would shuttle us to the airport. When it was time to get the shuttle they claim the driver never showed up and called us a cab. This made us behind schedule. I spend a lot of time in hotels for my job, and this was probably one of the weirdest and worst experiences."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Front desk welcomes you with a fresh baked cookie. Very helpful, they faxed some important papers for me without any question. Room was clean, great housekeeping services. Great bar/restaurant w/ Capers. Friendly bartenders. Tell Geoff I said hello!"}
{"text":"Filthy dirty, horrible customer service. We called for a room service menu, they never brought it. Whenever we called the front desk, which was only 2 or 3 times, the operator seemed annoyed and put out. We repeatedly had to go to the front desk because our house keys didn't work. There were sunflower seeds all over the floor in our room, so obviously it hadn't been swept, it was awful. Trust me, find another place."}
