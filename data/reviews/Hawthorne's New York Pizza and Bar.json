{"text":"First time here and service was great and restaurant looks well kept! In regards to food Garlic knots were delicious, however their meat and food quality overall definitely needs improvement. Both my husband and I got a sort of pasta. The meat on the lasagna and the meatballs were NOT good and the entire plate looked and tasted like it came out of a box from the grocery store. We wouldn't mind coming back to try the pizza as we saw others eating this and it looked good, but we definitely won't be getting any of their pasta again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and I've never had an issue with slow service. There have been several restaurants at this location and I hope this one is here to stay!  By the way, Heather is an absolutely fantastic server and we always request her section, but I have yet to get a server who is bad. Try it - I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time visit at this new location in Huntersville. Had pizza it was fresh and delish.  Service was very good too. Will be back again."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Lake Norman casual restaurant scene.  My wife and I had dinner there 12/22.  The first thing we noticed was how much the layout still showed the Cici's that had been in this space for so many years.  That comparison ends there, however.  The place was packed.  I believe it has been opened only for about one week.  Those facts would cripple many new restaurants.  Our food was a *little* slow coming out of the kitchen, but what impressed us was how much everyone on the staff seemed to be hustling, and everyone seemed to be pitching in to help one another.  Five different people tended to us at one point or the other.

Of course good service is nothing without good pizza, but the pizza we had was excellent -- as good as any I have had in Lake Norman or in Charlotte.  The crust was quite tasty and of a good consistency, the sauce was well seasoned, all of the toppings were fresh and of good quality.

So, welcome to Huntersville, Hawthorne's!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the pizzas, solid service and more than fair prices make Hawthornes a superior choice in Harrisburg. 
A must try are their \"garlic knots\" a great starter that compliments many of the delicious brews they have ready on tap."}
{"text":"Service was really slow this evening.  The food is worth the visit and the staff is always friendly.   Yummy cannoli!  The pizza was good. Nice crispy crust."}
{"text":"Greeted by the comforting smells of a classic pizza parlor was exciting for our first trip to Hawthorne's.  The NYC decor was a nice touch, and not over the top for a casual restaurant in Huntersville.  All staff was friendly and eagerly shared smiles.  The nameplate Hawthorne's salad was delicious and filling, if maybe a little heavy handed on the red onions.  The basil and mozzarella pizza did not disappoint; although the crust was different than what we are used to getting at Brixx.  The cannoli were petite, but I appreciated the fact that I didn't feel guilty about eating that serving size!"}
{"text":"pizza was very good, good beer specials, bar drinks aren't great, though."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the pizza here!! It's always on point. My only complaint would be the customer service. Every time we come in for dinner, the people at the hostess stand just stare at us. It's very uncomfortable and I just don't understand how hard it is to greet someone."}
{"text":"Sicilian pizza was not up to par. All bread with hardly any sauce or cheese (???). Paid way too much for what we got. Will not be ordering this again."}
{"text":"The meal was OK, but nothing exceptional for rememberable. Pizza and wings or what we had. The wings were warmed, so I wasn't sure they were fried fresh, and just covered with too much sauce. The pizza was OK, the crust was mediocre, the sauce was a little watery, and the vegetables were not free cook, so still crunchy."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place.  The wait to took forever.   We went on a Sunday evening at 6pm for a end of season soccer party. It was relatively empty and it still took 45 minutes just to take our drink order... now that is just ridiculous. Then finally took our food order around 7:15.  The waitress was pleasant,  but they really need to hire more staff. 

Now the food.   The garlic knots and wings were very good,  I would definitely order that again, if I go again.   The pizza was just average and the Shrimp Po Boy looked great but taste not so much. The Remoulade was very runny and not really flavorful and the waffles fries look and taste just like Ore Ida waffles fries,  nothing special.

Overall thus place is just ok, not in a rush to go again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just wasnt that great of pizza im usually open when it comes to pizza I would rather have papa johns, but great staff very nice people"}
{"text":"Expected more upon entering the restaurant after reading other Yelp reviews. I came for dinner, the service was awesome but the food not so much. Pasta tasted out of the box as well as the sauce from a can! Would I come back or recommend the restaurant to friends???.... if they wanted cooked food from food lion instead of authentic Italian....yes!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous guy who would've rated Hawthorne's a 3.5.  It's a good pie for this area and prices are good.  Service is prompt and attentive.  I love a good slice of pizza and Hawthorne's is a fine addition to the Burg.  Good but not great."}
{"text":"Do like expensive over powering garlic? Well come here! Food is good, but mega garlicky. We've ordered carry out several times throughout the years. It's always disappointing since the carry out portions in containers are so skimpy. Honestly, we just feel ripped off every time. It's expensive, garlicky & we just never learn."}
{"text":"Poor service, rather NO service. My husband and I walked out after about 15 minutes of no service. Plenty of servers walking around ignoring us, avoiding eye contact, etc. As we were leaving one server thanked us for coming in. ??? We went to another restaurant and had a wonderful dinner. It'll be hard to convince my husband to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!! Would in no way recommend this place. Food may be good but Service is the worst. Management is rude and unprofessional. Servers were busy hanging out and discussing how much they drank last night. Manager was busy at the bar trying to pick up women. We asked our server to speak to the manager about how unhappy we were. We watched the server go speak to the manager at the bar, the manager looked up at us and then continued to chat up the woman at the bar for another 20 mins. When he finally came to the table as we were leaving, he asked us \"whats the problem?\" Just rude. We will not be back!!! We will also share our horrendous experience with all of our friends and coworkers. A disgrace"}
{"text":"Service is good,  but the food is average at best.  Things like calzone are precooked then stuffed and reheated."}
{"text":"WOW! Need I say more? Incredible food, awesome staff and fantastic customer service.  I love Hawthorne's - closest food to NY Italian since Ive been in NC.
Just go..............you wont be disappointed!
GP"}
{"text":"Is a nice place, pizza was good.  Sometimes they need to leave it a couple of more minutes in the oven., nobody wants a white dough in their pzza. The wings are jumbo size which is a plus. Cheese steak not that great and their bread is not homemade.  The bar is minimal and uninspiring.  Not a place to have a drink.  Sat down on the bar and the same bartender ask me 3 different times if I was going to eat while drinking my first beer. I told him after I finish my beer, he said \" ok, beer with no food\" or something similar. Then he ask me again after I specifically told him that I order after mybeer, he said :\" oh, it's a big menu, i get it\". This guy was very annoying, don't know his name but he was over 6'2 feet tall, dark skin, curly hair. Got so annoying that decided to order to go.  If you want a better bar go to Killington in the same area. I will return to eat (maybe, try the pizza and cheese steakat Tony's pizza much better) , to drink never again. Don't care about their specials. The administration needs to know that sometimes people wants to unwind and enjoy their drink."}
{"text":"All of my family has been very happy with the things I've ordered so far: buffalo chicken pizza, garlic knots, calzone, and other pizzas- all have been so good.  I like the fact when I ordered  take out that the person told me they can do half and half pizzas and that you get more for your money that way.  Not many places will tell you how to save money so that was really nice.  I also live the trivia app/TV game you can play there."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Hawthorne's! We started off with the garlic knots, they were awesome!
... and free with the Yelp checkin offer!! The pizza was good. Everything about the pizza was really great except the crust is a little dry and like cardboard. We'll probably go back but maybe a little later as it was extremely family friendly and the wait time  was long."}
{"text":"Good food and great service I called today and asked about the menu since I have never been there before and my family and I moved here about 3 months ago I spoke to a gentleman that was very helpful but I asked to speak to the manager to see if he could help me with the questions about the menu. The manager was very helpful and very knowledgeable about items and I decided to try the kids cheese for my son , a side salad, and the manager let me know about the different pastas they have and what he suggested I wanted the chicken parmesan but he let me know i could get any pasta with it and for a little up charge I could get any sauce with it so I got Alfredo it was so delicious. My  wife got the spicy pasta with spinach and she said she loved it . When I picked the food up to go everyone was very nice and the gentleman at to go was awesome. I thanked the manager for his help im pretty sure his name was anthony. he told me about the weekly specials and as well as other promotions."}
{"text":"If you're looking for love in every bite, this gem is definitely a keeper!!  We ran across Hawthorne's while just cruising and decided to stop. Some decisions in life aren't good ones, but this one was excellent.  From the service to the food to the conversation with management, it was well worth it.  If you're in the area (or one of their other locations), STOP!!  Have a garlic knot or 6, grab a pizza and puh-lease indulge in some homemade chili!!!"}
{"text":"Today the pizza I received was so hard, so dry, so clearly *bleeped* up, that I cannot eat it. No one in my family wants to eat it. And I'll tell you why this bothers me so much, why it is I will never return to this place: either they have no clue what it is they are doing, in so far as making pizza, in which case why would you go back, or the person who made it took this shit out of the oven, saw how god-awful it was and still slipped it into a box and out the door in the hands of a customer--me--figuring by the time I'd notice, there would be nothing I could (or would) do about it.

If you know your business, then you know that this pizza should never have made it out of the kitchen, never have been sold. I would have been much happier if you had told me that the pizza hadn't come out right and you wanted to make another one, meaning I'd have to wait, than for you to sell me a $20-plus piece of trash--because that is where I put it, in the trash.

Now, having said that, I am partially to blame, for I have been to this location enough times--far too many times--to know that this place cannot make a quality pizza. In Charlotte they can! That's what is so bizarre. At their Charlotte location, the pizza is incredible. That is where I first experienced Hawthorne's and where I first became a repeat customer. I've since moved to Huntersville, however, and have been stuck, unfortunately, wishing and a-hoping this location will figure it out. They haven't.

It's clear someone down in Charlotte knows what they're doing. Maybe the folks in Huntersville would benefit from a trip down there to learn how to make pizza, and then return on, say, a bi-monthly basis for a refresher course--anything to put an end to these thin, overcooked, burned-on-the-bottom, raw-in-the-middle, dry-as-heck, hardly-any-cheese, pizzas of shit.

You know, it's things like convenience of location, familiarity, hope, that will kill a man's quest for better pizza. He'll just stick to what he knows. But then you mess with his sandwiches--higher prices, the length of the sandwich drastically reduced, less meat--and now you give him a pizza at which even a raccoon would turn up his nose. Well, that's when this man says, \"Good-bye, thanks for nothing. No more, I'm done--finito!\"

To those interested in good pizza, do. not. go. here."}
{"text":"I would have liked this review to be regarding the food and drinks. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to sit and give it a taste. 
We had been wanting to visit this location for over a year and finally decided to do it with a very good group of friends. I really hope the situation was simply because it was probably a long day for some. 
We had a party of 10 including kids, and to make the long story short we were waiting for over an hour and they still couldn't figure out how they were going to rearrange tables in order to sit us. We kept seen people come and leave and from our conversations they were waiting for a particular table to sit us which according to the personnel, was been cleaned for over thirty minutes. So I decided to go and check the status for myself. When seen that there were several tables cleaned and that it would only take a bit of thinking putting them together I went back to try and check with the people at front. This time I was told that there were people on the table they were going to assign to us and that they couldn't just ask them to leave. Imagine my jaw dropping when they acted like the ones being insulted.
After an hour and approximately ten minutes we decided to just go somewhere else and eat. After all everyone had had a long day on both sides. Before leaving I wanted to leave it on a good note so I approached the hostess to inform her we were going to go somewhere else and got a priceless look of \"after all the work we are putting on this?\".

Definitely needs work on the customer side, and probably a basic math class to know that 5 adults plus 4 kids plus one high chair is 10, not 7. After numerous attempts to correct the number we simply gave up.

Please do yourself a favor and drive to the one Uptown."}
{"text":"Superb family friendly Huntersville pizza and beer hang out!  So glad they moved in and opened up!  Their salads, all of them, are also very yummy.  It is hard to believe but they are already busy, a good sign of their success and acceptance in our community!  

Give them a try, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The crust tastes like cardboard. The environment feels like a chain restaurant. I was looking forward to authentic NY pizza. 

This is certainly not the place if that's what you have in mind."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout   1 Sicilian pie with extra cheese and 1 regular pie with extra cheese and pepperoni.  The people that work there are really nice and very efficient.  The pizza was GOOD not great  but GOOD. I will be going back.  It is 3 million times better than that dog food Jets Pizza"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Our go to pizza place. I can't speak to the service as I've only gotten it to go but I haven't had a bad experience yet. My husband loves the Elizabeth pizza while I love the plain cheese, garlic rolls are awesome and the Greek salad is delicious. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, we ordered onion ring app, one tricolor tortellini, one cappallini supreme, a full size pepperoni pizza, an individual white special, & an individual greek pizza. So, our cross of food was diverse enough. Everything was good, it all came out together. My biggest issue with this location was the lack of decor & the general layout. Most of the restaurant is wide open which didn't help with our conversation or overhearing screaming kids. I guess I've been spoiled by the Mint Hill location, much better decor & an actual bar."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of pizza but the men in my life are. So we came to this place. it was Sunday lunch time and they were not so busy but the wait on our server was longer than usual, but  he ended up being nice and did not mess up our order. The food was ok but not worth the price. They only have to sizes pizza \"tiny\" and large. The small which look tiny in my opinion was definitely not worth 10 dollars but at least it tasted good. My baked zitti with meatballs was ok. I ate it because I was hungry."}
{"text":"We love eat here! The meatballs R amazing and love the pizza too. We used to go to one in Charlotte, but glad one is in Harrisburg now!"}
{"text":"The food at hawthorns is really good I must say the Huntersville location has the best tasting food I have been to only two locations and Huntersville is my favorite"}
{"text":"Very convient near shopping pizza good good service."}
{"text":"They had a few hic-ups when they first opened but I can't say anything bad. The food is always good and the portions are on point. The prices are fair and have always had good service. I often sit at the bar when I am on my way home from work for a quick dinner and even if it is close to closing time they will not turn you away or skimp on service."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area wanted to try and you pizza place. I haven't had garlic knots and Sicilian pizza like that since I left the Bronx.  Great place great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend anyone looking for New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza my family has had in the south! Staff was friendly and very good at making recommendations based off of our requests!"}
{"text":"We got a recent \"To Go\" order form here. We ordered Philly cheese steaks subs. When we got home and opened the bag, the sandwiches were wrapped in foil, and the bread was like rubber. WTH??  Then, I got to reading the reviews on Yelp, and all the \"apologies\" from management. Just proves this place is below par, and all management does is apologize and remain status quo.... Really??  We also ate here about three weeks ago and the service SUX!! Waitress was about as clueless as one can get, didn't know the menu, and just smirked at everything. Pizza crust was rubbery, not crisp at all.... Harrisburg deserves a much better pizza joint! 

Will I go again, Me thinks NOT!!"}
{"text":"Food is good here but then the price increased a month ago. I understand a little but going from $8.95 to $10.95 for a 8\" cheesesteak? Ordered one with no peppers or onions, instead extra cheese and its $11.95?? Up charged me. Tony's is better $6.75 8\"   $7.99 12\". I should stick with my favorite. Plus it's better"}
{"text":"It's by no means amazing, but it is good food, fairly priced.  I didn't like the tables pushed together for a large party right at the front door.  It felt chaotic at the front when there was plenty of space throughout. 

Garlic knots  A+

Pizza is good.  The toppings however do not taste fresh.  And the dough lacks any flavor. 

The wings were cooked perfectly,  however the sauce tasted like General Tso from the JinJin down the street.

Kids Macaroni & Cheese - loved that it wasn't \"easy mac\"

Our server Hannah was awesome.   Friendly,  attentive, & knowledgeable of the menu.  The 4th star was for her.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love the Hawthornes on 7th street and was excited to see this one open. We have been 3 times and have been disappointed each time. It has gotten marginally better each time, that's why we keep going back. I keep thinking \"this time it will be like what I'm expecting\". Service is great, but food isn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Tried the drinks. They were bad. Tried the pizza, that was worse. Yet another disappointment in Harrisburg. I don't know how this place stays in business. It tasted nothing like I remembered from the original Hawthorne's."}
{"text":"Italian food is not my favorite choice... But my wife loves it. 
This place has become one of our favorite date night restaurants. The food, the service, the prices... Perfect. 
And of all the restaurants in the Harrisburg area, this is one of the best!! 
Calzones are great!! Enough for leftovers for tomorrow."}
{"text":"From Brooklyn to Staten Island now living in Charlotte,  they can compete with Staten Island best pizzerias. Mind you, I am doing take out.  The real test of a good pizza, warm it up in the oven on a pizza tray."}
{"text":"I only had take out from here once and we ordered a large pepperoni.  We usually order from Tony's in Huntersville but since Hawthorns is right across from my job, we decided to order from here and try it out. The pizza was absolutely delicious. The crust was really good and had a couple bubbles, which I really enjoy.  We'll definitely try this place again and I sure hope we have the same experience."}
{"text":"Hawthornes Pizza is a nice little gem in an otherwise average shopping center. Service as friendly and helpful, menu was full of a great variety of products, and food was great. 

We had onion rings, a salad, and an eggplant sub. Each dish was unique and made with fresh ingredients. Since we came for lunch, we didn't partake, but there seems to be a good wine and beer list as well. 

The only reason I can't justify this bring a 5-Star is that nothing really stood out. Food was good, service was good, but there really isn't anything memorable about it. Just an average pizza joint, with good food. But honestly, who is really going to complain about pizza?"}
{"text":"The garlic knots and NY pepperoni pizza were great!  Love the dipping butter and garlic in the knot tray. The side salad was pretty plain and measly, not worth the price.  The crust was not as good as other places around here and the sauce had a strong oregano taste to it. Other than it will be a place we order from occasionally."}
{"text":"Food was just ok for the price. Very strong smell of bathroom cleaner made it hard to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"We had a18 inch cheese pizza and mozzarella  and tomato appetizer.   The crust was  thin and crispy with good flavor and consistency. The appetizer was fresh mozzarella tomato with their basil vinegar dressing. It was delicious. We even purchased the dressing to take home. This is the third time we have been here. We never had a bad meal. Service is fast and thorough. No complaints."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good chili!  Great selection of food - Italian dishes all pretty good and their tomato sauce is great.  Kids eat free on Thursdays."}
{"text":"I can't believe all the bad reviews. My family goes here periodically and everybody loves their food. We've never had a problem with the service. And since we go on Tuesdays when kids eat free, everything is a great value. My wife and I absolutely love their eggplant parmesan: a must try."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free and called and ordered a gluten free pizza. I was told it would be the same size as their other regular pizzas (large pizzas). I got there and my pizza was way smaller than other pizzas. Probably the smallest size pizza they sell. The pizza was burned and disgusting. On top of that it was $15.00. Definitely not worth it and I will never go back. I don't even know why they bother selling a gluten free pizza, as disgusting as that one was."}
{"text":"I love Hawthornes! Their pizza is really good and the garlic knots are the best that I have ever eaten. They also have delicious sandwiches and they will often feature a special sandwich. You really can't go wrong here! I would recommend the special white pizza!"}
{"text":"We keep going back and they get better each time.  Im happy to say that Hawthorne's has become a family favorite."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Huntersville. Closest to New York style in the are, but NY pizza snobs might not agree : ) Garlic knots are great as well. Favorite pie is the Elizabeth Special or just plain old cheese."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza are awesome. Decent beer prices too."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! Great NY style crust and ample toppings...lots to choose from! Service was fast and friendly...good lunch option. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had their pizza which is really good and the chicken Marsala with mushrooms and mash potatoes really good"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great garlic nots and the food is great no matter what you get. We always have great service here. We have eaten here several times never a bad experience. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Got pizza to go on Sunday evening.   After 50 minutes (no, I wouldn't have waited that long if I'd known... the  y said 30-35) we received our pizza and headed home for the 5 minute drive.  When we got home, the pizza was cold.  I'm not talking about cool from the ride home, I mean like it had been out of the oven for 30 minutes.  We warmed it up and it was still awesome.  It's surprising that the pizza is consistent from other locations.  The take out ordering needs to improve and communication from there and the kitchen needs to improve but the pizza doesn't."}
{"text":"A much needed addition to the exit 23 dining options. My husband had the buffalo wing chicken. I had the side salad and penne a la vodka. All the items were great. The staff is super friendly and helpful. This new location is clean and charming. I sat at the bar while I waited for my take out order. This is a new location, so I could tell they are still getting the hang of things. But that would not deter from eating here again. PS - It didn't hurt that the young men at the take out station thought I looked young for a mom/stepmom to 5 kids. :)"}
{"text":"We always order take out but decided to eat in and found the service very fast, friendly, and the food was awesome! My husband tried a beer and ended up not caring for it but he was going to drink it anyway and our sweetheart of a waitress insisted on taking it and brought him another one no charge. Extremely service focused! Fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is really convenient for us. The food is good. Go there and remember this is basically a pizza shop not a gourmet restaurant. You can tell that the owners really try to be progressive. They recently changed the menu and added some great new things.
The store managers are on top of things and go way out of the way to make everyone happy.
The service by the wait staff is efficient. I do think there are certain things our last server could be coached on. Her uniform, to me wasn't acceptable for serving (let me say the yoga pants were 3 sizes to small outlining parts of the body I need not see while eating). She walked over while we were eating and gave us the check. We tipped her the bare minimum although we usually tip 25%. The place wasn't busy, we were there off hours so there shouldn't have been a rush.
I had a side salad that was very good and a slice of pizza. My wife had two slices. One was just plain cheese the other was the slice of the day. She enjoyed them both."}
{"text":"We split a Caesar salad and each got a calzone...that was plenty of food. Caesar was excellent with the perfect amount of dressing. Calzones had a nice seasoning on them and cooked to perfection. I had pepperoni, banana peppers and Roma tomatoes in mine and she had mushrooms, Roma tomatoes and bacon in hers. We really enjoyed it all. Really nice staff, plenty of TVs and even a little live music."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Jennifer was a dream. The best waitress ever. I had the Penne Ala Vodka with meatballs. So so so yummy. I forgot to take a pic but trust me it's good. Hubby had the Gorgonzola pasta with chicken and it was equally amazing. Their island wings are bomb too. Omg their chili con queso is beast. It's our third time coming here and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Dined here with my husband and 3 year old son for dinner, we arrived around 5 and the restaurant was less than half full.  We were sat quickly and received our drink orders in a timely manner. We ordered a pizza with half pepperoni to share. The pizza arrived in a timely manner but was all pepperoni instead of being half.  We pulled off the pepperoni for our son and began eating the pizza. Our server finally came to check on us about 15 minutes after the pizza was delivered to see how it was...at this time my husband who had not been at the table when the pizza was delivered, mentioned the mix-up....the server half apologized, saying he thought we asked for all pepperoni and breifly offered to get our son a piece of cheese (my son was already done eating at this point), we declined and he left. At the end of our meal, he brought a check with the charge for a pizza with pepperoni (instead of the half pepperoni we ordered). He tried to make it \"no big deal\", stating the half pepperoni only saves you 1.50 but that he could change it if my husband wanted.  My husband asked him to change it and gave his credit card to run.  At this point my husband left to get our child in the car, when the server came back with our check, he had charged the full amount to our card. So, unfortunately the restaurant lost a star for this move.
  As for the pizza........ The crust was very tasty, nice flavor, thickness and crunchiness on the edge, a little soggy on the underside in spots.  I thought the sauce was decent but a little sweet for my taste. The big problem with the pizza was the crazy amount of grease on the pizza (my husband who typically never blots grease off his pizza did tonight).  Overall I would have given the restaurant a 3 star rating for the food taste/quality."}
{"text":"Their pizza is average but it used to be a lot better. The past two visits here have made me sick. I'll be finding another pizza place to go to."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is new to the Rosedale area but the pizza was delicious! We ordered the one with pepperoni, italian sausage, green pepper, onions and mushrooms and it was so good! The garlic knots are a must being the perfect combination of hot, soft and buttery with a little crunch. Definitely our new pizza spot! We took ours to go so I cant say too much about the service or the people but they seemed nice."}
{"text":"Wonderful management; helpful, kind, and attentive front of house members; great atmosphere; coupled with lovely food for any occasion!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place again for eat-in. Salads were great--portion and flavor, so I guess it's just the take-out size that's disappointing (see earlier post). Calzone and Stromboli were very tasty, but not as big as the ones at Tonys (our go-to Italian). Alfredo was very tasty. We would eat in here again but won't do takeout."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the highland creek location for over 2 years. This is our favorite family nite restaurant! Now that they are located in Hunterville , we have been there almost once a week. We usually stick to pizza and salad but when family came in town for the holidays everyone wanted something different and I must say that the spinach and mushroom penne is AMAZING! So very good! The calzone are to die for and my kids absolutely loved the wings and Mac n cheese. Need a quick lunch... My fav is the chopped salad with house dressing. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The pizza, pasta, and salads are all very good. The beer selection is usually pretty good, and typically includes at least a few local drafts. It is not unusual to find a decent beer special. Service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here several times as we live fairly close and when we need to eat on the run the location is convenient. It's hit or miss. I always order the same thing - gluten free penne primavera (vegetarian and no Gorgonzola - this place is REAL heavy on Gorgonzola). Some orders come out with plain marinara others come with the creamy marinara listed on the menu. I could take it or leave it. Veggies in the pasta are huge and need more careful attention in the kitchen so I'm not stuck trying to saw a stalk of broccoli into 5ths to make it edible. I'll continue coming here for the convenience, but I would love to see healthier options on the pasta menu."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is not cutting it. We go to enjoy the food, definitely not get out in a reasonable time or be delighted by customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to see here, folks.

I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon and I can confidently report that there is nothing slightly reminiscent of NY-style anything. The decor is quite drab and sad. It's a mostly wooden interior with a couple of large screen TVs. There seemed to be no order to how the tables were set up.  The bar area? quite sad.

There seem to be a couple of entrances to this place. The one I chose, didn't have a hostess so I had to awkwardly walk well into the restaurant, past tables and such, to get assistance. 

I ordered the 9-inch BBQ chicken and it tasted quite similar to Papa John's - honestly. The 9-inch contained four wide-ish slices of pizza. 

The service was friendly and courteous but I would not come here looking for anything like an authentic NY slice."}
{"text":"The food there is great, to bad I can't say the same about the server. The homemade potato chips ( w/ rance dipping sauce), mussles, salads, and pizzas are great."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is a great, quick and friendly spot for family pizza. The foods great and the owners always walk around and make sure you are happy.  That goes a long way."}
{"text":"I always have excellent service here. The staff is very friendly! The food is awesome. LOVE the homemade chips and dip. Pizzas are great and haven't had a sandwich yet that wasn't wonderful! Great beer specials too! One of my favorite places to take the family out to eat."}
{"text":"Great service and great staff. Wonderful location and atmosphere, but the pizza was just not up to par. Crust has no flavor and severe lack of toppings. I was excited to see one coming to Huntersville, but the one on Carmel Rd is MUCH better. I have to say I'm a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Updating my review after a few more visits!  We have really tried to give this place more tries because it's in our town and there are SO few dining choices here in Harrisburg.

We have received horrible service by a specific server a few times.  I wish I knew her name, but she only left a poor impression.  Both times this happened we had a group of about 8 people.  As a former server of many years- big groups are where the money is made, but you also have to work harder- which she obviously does not care to do.

On the specific night I'm referring to, both my husband and another diner in our group wanted lasagna.  The lasagna had apparently ran out for the evening.  Instead of telling us in a professional way or maybe suggesting an alternative, she responded with \"you should have came earlier if you wanted that.\"  We all looked around at each other, pretty shocked that the server would say that.  It was a very rude response.

The food then took a very long time- not sure if this was the kitchen or her not being prompt sending our order in.  The food was OK when it got there, but the service we received was so sub par the night was tainted.  Unfortunately this made an entire table of Harrisburg living friends to not return."}
{"text":"Updated on 12/4. Our visit last week was a completely different experience than the first. Had this been our only visit I would have given it four stars. We split crispy Cajun shrimp, garlic knots, chicken bacon ranch pizza and buffalo chicken pizza with a few friends. No complaints. The food was good. 
--------------------------------------------
Placed an order to-go to feed visiting family. While the food smelled delicious on the ride home, the meal was bland. We ordered the Basil Mozzarella pizza, Caesar salad, wings tossed in spicy sauce and crispy Cajun shrimp. The best tasting item we had was the salad. The wings barely had any sauce and the pizza lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Gorgonzola salad was fresh and pecans were great! We liked the pizza and knots as well, nice foldable slices!! Most notable thing however was the service,  now granted I as there for take out but was very impressed. First time in the restaurant, young man greeted me at the door (African American, glasses, grey hat?). Asked all the right questions when taking my order to make sure it was correct, honored my coupon that I forgot after checking with a manager, and gave me 2 time updates while I was waiting. Was also offered water and shown my pizza prior to departure."}
{"text":"We moved to Harrisburg right after Thanksgiving and we ate here after Christmas with my in-laws.  There were several doors to enter and when we walked through the dining room toward what looked like the hostess stand, we were then told it was the other direction and we're looked at like we were stupid for not knowing where to go. Hostesses were not friendly at all. We all enjoyed the pizza and salads and the drinks were very good. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food here is hit or miss.  More times than not, the pizza crust is soggy on the bottom.   It just seems that they are in a hurry to get your food that it doesn't seem that it is fully cooked."}
{"text":"So, while we were there eating the waitress came out to tell the fellows that a gentlemen driving by saw them (Purple Heart Society) and stopped in to pay for all their meals. Now, Hawthorne's was already doing that but such a cool thing to witness. With all the controversy with the military lately it's good to see that they still get and deserve respect from folks they protect. With that said; the food was very good I highly recommend the \"Sausage and Peppers App\" as your starter. Spot on. They have a Diablo sauce that is pretty hot for you \"Numb Tonguers\" out there."}
{"text":"This place reminds me the local pizza places up in New York. I used to live in the Westchester County area and it is a really authentic place. The pasta sauces do not taste like they are straight from a can and the bread is freshly made on the premises for an outstanding taste. The bread for the sandwiches are also made on the premises and taste really good. Very busy location, make sure you come hungry and with time to wait!

They do not deliver though, but if they did, I would always order pizza/pastas from them rather than Mama's Pizza on NC-115."}
{"text":"First time trying Hawthorne's and will definitely be back for future visits. Clean, friendly, and relatively quick service even for a substantial party. To my knowledge, Hawthorne's is a relatively new pizza chain, or is at least new to this area.

Everything Hawthorne's brought out looked delicious. I shared a spinach artichoke dip with a coworker and it was one of the best I have had. We also elected to try their house special \"inducer\" pizza which was a house made buffalo chicken pizza: amazing. Tons of flavor and plenty for two people to share. We both took slices home.

The chairs were a surprise as they had a lot of cushion. The tables and booths were very neat and clean. There was a chalk board sign with all the specials for the day clearly laid out. Be prepared to pay a bit more for this place, but I think the quality is well worth the price."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and got ripped off. I ordered the Gorgonzola salad with blackened chicken and my boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo. To my surprise our tab was 35$ I think that is extremely high for lunch prices I'm sorry. Oh and for the 18$ Alfredo the to go box was barely half way filled"}
{"text":"Great location. Amazing New York pizza. Friendly staff. Easy take out. Always our go to on pizza night!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I loved the combinations of toppings for their specialty pizzas. I'm not an expert on NY pizza, but it was good, and the waitress made some suggestions to our order that saved us money and got us more pizza. Service was prompt, friendly. It was a great experience - a nice surprise because we haven't found that many restaurants we like in the Highland Creek area. The appetizers were good as well. It's a crowded neighborhood joint that is comfortable - it just feels like a nice place to sit and have a beer and a slice of pizza. They had a kids menu as well that was decently priced with typical kid-pizza offerings."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant just for the heck of it and ordered a couple of 9 inch pizzas. The bbq pizza was watery and the sauce was too sweet. The cheese was gummy. The waiter never asked if I wanted another beer.  I will not return. Below average facility."}
{"text":"The server seemed untrained. She could not explain difference between calzone and Stromboli. She kept saying, \"I think...\" to describe the two. She did not tell us entree specials only drink specials. We heard her telling others after we were eating. The food was only so-so. We'll take our hard earned money elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Food was good and server was fine, but another server brought food and asked if we needed anything.  I asked for a soda refill and he responded, \"What's the magic word?\"  I don't enjoy being spoken to like a child when I am paying for service."}
{"text":"The food itself isn't terrible at Hawthorne's however, never in my life have I gone to a pizza place that doesn't offer a simple pepperoni Stromboli or calzone. A few weeks ago I called and asked for a Stromboli and was told they are made every morning so they can't be customized but I could order a calzone with no ricotta so that's what I did. Fast forward to today and I called to order and was told that they also make the calzones ahead of time and the ricotta cannot be removed. Their menu only offers two kinds of stromboli so if they don't want to offer made to order menu items, perhaps they should broaden their menu options a bit. 
The atmosphere is also something to be desired if you choose to dine in. Sort of pizza buffet of the 90s feel to the dining room. 
This place is so convenient to our house but due to the limited choices/lack of customization available, we won't be returning here any longer."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite and go to restaurants for dine in and take out. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food from pizza, pasta, salads, and sandwiches are wonderful. Bram and Carlos are wonderful managers and really care about people. They are a HUGE supporters of the community and have supported me and the MS walks for the last 2 years."}
{"text":"Amazing people, great food & they really give back to the community.  Please give them your business, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Quickly got seated, longer than normal wait for first visit from our server to take the drink order.  Meat Eaters pizza is not worth remembering, boring and bland.
  The diablo mussels and fried jalapeño  peppers were quite the opposite.  Out of the norm and full of flavor.  The diablo sauce was so tasty that I practically ate it with a spoon.
   $42 dinner for 2 people (no alcohol) puts Hawthornes a bit on the pricey side for a self described pizza joint."}
{"text":"If I could give Hawthornes 3 and a half stars I would. The food was average and so was the service. What makes this place good is the daily drink specials and the sports bar feel to it. I'm also happy that they finally opened a place like this in Harrisburg. This town was in desperate need for more versatility when it comes to bars of some sort, and Hawthornes definitely stepped up to the plate in that aspect."}
{"text":"I thought we would give Hawthorne's another try. 
We ordered a Sicilian pizza and Wings. They both were good, but the crust was burnt on the pizza.
Maybe third times a charm??"}
{"text":"I am writing this because I have been a loyal Hawthorne's customer for at least 10years. I used to go to the 7th Street location a lot when I attended CPCC. I now live in Concord close to the Harrisburg location but usually go to Highland Creek location because the food is always consistent and good. I have ordered take out from Harrisburg several times and always have issues. I even brought my sons soccer team there several years ago and was disappointed we had called several days ahead and the manager (Victoria? at the time) hadn't even set up the tables for the team and parents.
 So, last week my kids asked for Hawthorne's and I was working in Harrisburg that day and called in an order. First I was put on hold no biggie but then was greeted by another employee a few minutes later that said thank you for holding from Rea Rd, I was like WHAT?? She quickly said oh I was hoping you didn't catch that. Anyway, I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, and a spinach salad. I was told it will be ready in 15mins. I stopped at the store before hand and was worried I would be late. When I arrived 30mins later the order wasn't ready. The restaurant wasn't even busy but I waited. When I got home the garlic knots were undercooked white in color and doughy, the spinach salad had rotten leaves  no boiled egg and the dressing on the side had leaked inside the bag. The pizza was ok, My kids even said \"this doesn't taste like when you go to Highland Creek\". In the past when I've ordered take out from Harrisburg I have been disappointed but never bothered to call. I decided to call this time so possibly this won't happen to another customer. I asked for manager and was told there wasn't one available but if I wasn't happy with my order I could come back for gift card. I don't want a gift card or my $35 back. I guess I will definitely make the drive to Highland Creek or another location. Its really too bad because there are so few Restaurants in Harrisburg and now I will not return,"}
{"text":"We are regulars here. The pizza is good, and quality is consistent. BEST garlic knots in town. The chop salad is also a favorite. Servers, hostesses and management are always friendly. The best part is that they have a claw machine for the kids to play on while we wait for our food and enjoy a drink..even if we have an extra long wait or a not-so great visit, the claw machine is the kids' favorite, and keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"First time at this Hawthorne's.  On the positive side, the store including the rest rooms were very clean.  

Our waiter Chris was nice, but despite our ability to clearly articulate what we wanted.  Our order was wrong at several levels.  The food is ok and is presented nicely.  

We ordered a bowel of Chili that was tasty, but were told there were no crackers, they gave us some cornbread instead.  The table behind us had 2 small children who were tossing the little Goldfish crackers on the floor. ????

I ordered the Tri-color tortellini with 1 meatball on the side the dish came with the meatball chopped up in it, ruined the plate.  We also had to remind the waiter that the BLTA (Avacado) did not arrive with the other dishes, despite clearly watching him write it down in front of us. 

Lunch was ruined even though he tried to correct the errors but failed to remove the tortellini from the check, therefore we will not be back."}
{"text":"Meh! This place is the Chucky Cheese of Huntersville. Their pizza is two stars at best, which would be fine if they weren't priced like the better pizza joints in town. The true measure of value is quality/price. I feel like in this equation they need to raise the quality or lower the price.

Their trivia is fun and always on!"}
{"text":"Found this place just driving by and boy am I glad we did! My family was in town and we decided to stop in for dinner on a Sunday evening.  We didn't realize there were separate entrances for the bar/patio and the formal dining room, so we sat at a high-top in the bar which had just one other family in it dining out for Father's Day.  Our waitress was more than friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed as I think she may have been the bartender and waitress for the back room and the patio.  We decided to split the Basil Mozzarella pizza (an 18\" was huge, we brought home 3-4 slices), the baked ziti, and a Tuscan salad.  The salad was plenty large enough for us to share and perfectly dressed! It was so yummy.  The pizza was also delicious with tomatoes and basil, loved the crust! Lastly the baked ziti, it was good, but nothing crazy special.  I'd definitely order the pizza and salad again, but probably not the pasta.  I can say I'll be back soon though, happy to have this place nearby."}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience the pizza was good the service was excellent the place was clean the menu was complete the staff works hard  in comfort"}
{"text":"We were seated right away on a weekday evening.  The service was quick and friendly.  I had the meatballs for an appetizer, they are pretty small, just the right size to start things out with.   I was surprised that the taste was really good.  The marinara is also good and a perfect mix of sweet and savory.  I got the calzone, although I wanted a Stromboli because I hate the ricotta cheese.  They informed me that they only had premade Stromboli with certain filling items I did not like, so I had the get the calzone to customize it.  The calzone was pretty good, it had a lot of ricotta cheese in it, so if you like that, then it's a good thing.  The outside was cooked perfectly and the overall taste was satisfying.  I may try something else at my next visit."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I've been to this Hawthorne's and I've been to others a few times. Enough to know that I'm not a fan of their pizza. Their salads are really good and a big step above quality wise than you would expect from a pizza joint. That is my overall summary of Hawthorne's but this particular time I ordered the buffalo chicken Stromboli and my husband got the Italian. He enjoyed his but I was very dissappointed with mine. It'sbeen a year since I last had it and was very happy with it before. This time it had little flavor, almost zero buffalo flavor and was made with breaded chicken tenders. I don't remember that being the case the last time. Basically it was breaded buffalo season tenders and mozzarella cheese. No extra hot sauce inside, nothing. 

I typically eat extremely healthy but decided early in the week to splurge and get this. I had been looking forward to it all week and ended up disappointed and cranky afterwards. I guess the positive side is that I only ate half and threw rest out...positive in that it wasn't as many calories From eating the whole thing. :(

If I go back, I will stick with their salad."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. 

The first time I was there was a few years ago, and the pizza was better than expected, yet not amazing. 

On the second visit, I sat at the bar with two friends, ate some wings, and appreciated good service. 

On the third visit, I was alone at the bar and ordered pizza. The pizza wasn't good and the bartender was sitting at a booth working on some kind of project. 

Overall, subpar food and subpar service. You will be much better off going to Brooklyn South in Cornelius."}
{"text":"My daughter had their feta cheese, basil, olive oil pizza, and ended up with nausea and vomiting later that night. We had to take her to the ER."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza. All else on menu lacking a little. Fair- atmosphere. Wish could expand bar a little. Good location for one. Friendly staff and they get it right!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Heather was fun and treated us like family.   We split the Antipasto salad (Zesty salty yum-ness) and combined it with  the Luau pizza (a sweet and salty pie on a thin crisp crust).   Was my 1st time and my girlfriend's umtheenth.    Clearly she needs to bring me here more. ;)"}
{"text":"Good food. My husband is addicted to the eggplant rolatini. A bit pricey.  Pizza is good too."}
{"text":"Not even sure why we gave them a second chance.  Had their food when they first opened in Huntersville because we loved the one in Elizabeth, and it was terrible.  2 years later we decided to try again and it might be worse than last time.  My husband and I both ordered their Stromboli.  The dough is super thick and completely flavorless, the ingredients were clearly all cheap frozen bagged.  The broccoli was so disgusting that it made the entire thing inedible.  Their sauce tastes like cheap canned off brand and the garlic knots were the same flavorless dough with a TON of oil.  Do yourself a favor and go to Brooklyn South instead.  So disappointing and a waste of $25."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a few times now, but today decided to stop in for an early lunch.  This place checked all the boxes of a really good place to eat.  

Outside:  
Curb appeal, clean and casual classy.  Plentiful parking.

Inside:  
All surfaces where shiny, sparkling and the decor was simple.  

Service:  
Courteous!  Smiles from the super friendly adorable hostess from the moment I walked in.  She told me what the specials were, and asked me if I wanted to sit down or take out.  I was ushered to the bar, and the service was Quick!  I got my lunch, in less than seven minutes from the friendly bartender.  He showed me my two slices before I left to ascertain that everything was copasetic, and he even offered me a detailed receipt without my having to ask.

Menu:  
Lunch menu was nice, with offerings for any taste and budget.  I am from New York, so I get weary when I see \"NY Style Pizza.\"  But this was the real thing.  The crust, the cheese the sauce (it was authentic).

Price:  
I kept it super simple with two yummy cheese slices with a perfect Arnold Palmer for just over eight bucks with tip.

Finally:
Before you take this review with a grain of salt...  See how many places earn five stars from this Yelper.  Not a lot, so it must be on point.

Now:
I am out but I will most certainly, absolutely and without a doubt be back."}
{"text":"Glad to see this location in Huntersville!  Was a huge fan of the other location in Highland Creek.  Great thing is they brought the same quality of food to this location.  Had the calzones, and they were delicious.  Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this pizza, it's good, and the crust is really tasty, but it's not great.  The big issue is that it's really, REALLY greasy.  I normally like a good NY slice from the greenwich village subway stop, but this put grease to a new level for me.  I never blott my pizza, but I used a handful of napkins for the top and bottom of the pie.  I don't know if it's the cheese  being lower grade or the sauce, but it's a big detractor for the pizza as appearance is important to flavor.  The pepperoni was not crispy, just hot, and the dough was good, but felt like it could have been cooked just a little more, but that might have been the grease.

Service was also blah!  Half pep/half cheese came out all pepperoni, and the server was not very focused on us, more on the table next to us.  I also don't like how the menu is setup.  It should be easy to understand what I am ordering and paying for a pizza - I had no clue till I got my bill - what is a small cheese pizza cost and large cost?  Bar pie?  New Yorker?  Just call it pizza.  The menu is overloaded - for being a Pizza place, pizza is footnote compared to the other items (sandwiches, pasta, bakes, wings, appetizers, salads, strombolis, calzones, random chicken dishes, etc.)  

Bottom line - it's OK - but don't go out of your way for their pizza."}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this establishment previously but my review is not online.  I enjoy the atmosphere at Hawthorne's.  Service is great and the food is delicious.  My favorite is Pesto Pizza with chicken.  The pizza is just the right size when a hungry woman (me) comes in for food.  A quick check of the website shows they have many NEW options on the menu that I look forward to trying.  Their varied menu surely has something for everyone in the family or group and they also carry a kids menu.  You can't go wrong at Hawthorne's.  While they are typically busy, there is usually no wait time for a table.  They have an outside patio seating area as well.  The restaurant has a full bar for liquid refreshment to go along with your food."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining in but not our first time trying the pizza. The entrance is a little confusing as there are doors on both ends. We ended up going in the one for take out then had to go back out to the other entrance to be seated for dine in. 

Once we were seated we were greeted quickly and had our drinks brought to us. There is a good selection of pizza and other items. I must say the Long Island Flavored (sweet & spicy) wings were VERY good!! 
We also ordered a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza (1/2 Elizabeth and 1/2 Buffalo). Both were very tasty and definitely not skimpy on the toppings."}
{"text":"I asked one of my friends from Harrisburg if he had tried Hawthorne's pizza and he told me to save my money. Even though I asked for his opinion I still like to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt. Knowing a restaurant can have a \"bad day\" I'll give a place three tries. 

So I decided to give them a try and stopped by yesterday to pick up their version of a deluxe style pizza. They call it an \"Elizabeth\". I also added banana peppers. For an 18\" pizza I thought it felt a little light in the box carrying it out to my car. Turns out that was one of the worst pizza's I've ever wasted my hard earned money on. Almost as bad as Domino's.  In my mind, a good pizza should start with a really good quality hand made crust, which this had - no complaints there, and then top quality ingredients, including the cheeses and especially the sauce.

Well, at least they got the crust down pat. As far as the ingredients, what few there were, just didn't taste like top shelf ingredients, plain - for a lack of a better definition. In my opinion the sauce was just wrong. Quality wise I'd rate it right up there with Papa's Johns, the little 'pizza-pizza man', Domino's - or Pizza Hut. I don't have a problem paying close to $25 for a pie but at the very least I expect decent quality. I didn't get that at Hawthorne's. Will I give them two more tries? Maybe - probably - but it won't be for their pizza! Maybe Fuel Pizza will come to Harrisburg some day :)"}
{"text":"Good manicotti...would eat again.  Wife had ravioli...said it was good.  Will come back and try other things on the menu.  Look forward to another visit and another review. Seems a little pricey but I'll reserve judgment for another visit."}
{"text":"You know when you bite into a good quality tasting and flavorful slice of pizza... This is one of them. The Elizabeth, my FAV!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a improvement.  Went there for lunch yesterday. Fantastic service and food. Best lunch in Charlotte. Five stars.   Best salads EVER"}
{"text":"Being from New Jersey I was told they had good pizza here. Maybe I am over critical on pizza. Food was good, portion was small for the price. We got s pizza and a Stromboli as well as mozzarella sticks. Where they sat us and the time of  day the bar tender was our waitress. There was one person at the bar and one other couple in the section we were at. She was to busy flirting with the dude at the bar to offer me refills or another drink. I had to get up twice to ask for service. Maybe she was having a bad day , I dunno. I may give it another try but not too impressed."}
{"text":"My family loves Hawthornes! Weve only ordered just pizza but its really good. We like the vibe inside and the staff are pretty nice! FYI-Parking can be hard to find on busy nights/holidays due to its proximity to Publix and other restaurants. Tried the buffalo chkn pizza aka \"The Inducer\" when i was 40 weeks pregnant, sadly i didnt go into labor from it. But it was soo good!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews this way but, the visit to Hawthorne's called for a different approach due to the variety of the components of the visit.

Service:  5 Stars
Greeted in a friendly way, seated and immediately asked for drink orders.  One minute later a manager came up saying he noticed our server was double seated and wanted to make sure we got a drink order in. That was a nice touch.  Our server overall was friendly and while very busy with a lot of tables, showed us an appropriate level of attention. Lots of different people brought food, cleared plates, etc. so a real team oriented approach to service.

Salad:  4 Stars
Got the Hawthorne's Salad which is mixed greens with candied pecans, mandarin orange slices, grape tomatoes, pepperoncinis and served with a blue cheese vinaigrette.  All the components of the salad were fresh.  The candied pecans were hit or miss in terms of being candied.  The dressing did not hit me with much blue cheese flavor but was still very good and complimented the rest of the salad.  One note - Stop charging $1 to split plates.  That feels like such a nickel and dime kind of move and the way it annoys customers is not worth the few bucks you make off the practice.  

Pizza:  2-3 Stars
It was A-OK in that it beat the frozen pizza I've got at home and was better than Dominos but to call this New York pizza is an insult to New York pizza.  The biggest problem is the crust.  No chew to it whatsoever.  More bready than that yummy marriage of crispy and chewy that a real NY pizza crust brings to the table.  I would love them to switch to a higher gluten flour.  The toppings were a mixed bag.  I really liked the beef being chunks of hamburger and not beef pellets. The pepperoni was nothing special but just fine.  The white onions (nice touch to offer red or white) were plentiful but not really cooked enough.  The cheese was average and the sauce was too sweet and, other than the crust, the worst thing on the pie.

The menu has a good deal of variety and based on the salad and service quality we will be back to try other things but in terms of pizza, we'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sandwich I've had in a while! The bread was delicious, with roasted red peppers, basil, and a perfectly cooked & tender chicken cutlet. Service was amazing. We came at 12:30, table of 4, we had a couple people come to our table to serve us and our waitress was on top of it! Great open ambiance. I wish there were more of these places where I lived! 100% recommend"}
