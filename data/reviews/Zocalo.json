{"text":"Great little place with freshness all over the menu. Simple but superb. Even the peas taste better. Not for big gatherings but nice quaint spot."}
{"text":"Such a great spot. 
Good staff. Intimate. Well presented and non-pretentious. It's become our neighbourhood go-to. Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  The food is always delicious and arrives at your table in a timely fashion.  The service is friendly and efficient - no pretentious attitudes here!  The price is what I am willing to pay for consistently yummy food and great service.  The vibe is comfortable and warm - just what I'm looking for in a weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"This was a great find in my neighbourhood!  I love the decor, a super cozy and funky restaurant with chandeliers and distressed furniture that is truly unexpected in the gap between Landsdowne and Bloor.  

The restaurant has a fairly small menu, which I love, because it shows focus.  The squash was delicious, as well as the broken bread sandwiches and their meat entree. Arugula salad was simple and dressed perfectly. Dishes are creative, stylishly plated, and reasonably priced at $10-$15 an entree with great little add-ons (i.e. cup of soup for $3).  My only complaint was that there wasn't more food on the plate, as I was quite hungry at the time!

Zocalo has gotten a lot of great reviews recently in Now and Toronto Life so it's a good idea to book ahead.  Staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Great local selection of ingredients and dishes at very affordable prices. Zocalo's friendly service welcome a fairly large group of us (7) at relatively short notice. 

Their cheese and meat boards to start were a highlight for sure. My friend and I shared the chicken pot pie and steak sausage dish, while the first was a \"nothing special\" the latter was quite good. The wine menu while small had some great affordable options. 

Desserts were pretty solid with a nice apricot crumble. If you're in the area Zocalo is worth exploring!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch.  3.5 stars

I had the warm chicken salad.  The broken bread meals seem to be a deconstruction of sandwiches.  My dish had subtle flavor of tarragon and whole mustard.  Was good when warm and not as good as it got colder.  The bread was good.  Also like that there were different varieties of bread.  I didn't care much for the strawberry hummus.  Tasted like strawberry yogurt which would have been fine as a side but doesn't really go with the already saucy chicken.  

I had a side sausage which they say is a homemade link.  It was, frankly, dry.  

My coffee was solid.  Nothing special Americano but done well enough.

The disappointment was with the cucumber mint juice.  I sampled a friends and it tasted like pickle water.  I'm gonna rate them based on what I ordered and the main meal.  

Service was friendly and fast.  Big portions.  Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zocalo is a welcome addtion to this baron strip of Bloor Street West!
The place is cute and minimal and was not too busy when a friend and I went for a weekday lunch. 
They serve these deconstructed sandwiches which are tasty but not what I would classify as a meal.  The positve points here are that they have a veg-friendly options with locally sourced ingredients. 
I might pass by again when I am not so hungry."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic date spot. Such good food, great atmosphere and lovely staff. Broken bread entr√©s are healthy, tastey and unique!"}
{"text":"Zocalo, been here twice, first time, thought it very fine, the broken bread platter, cucumber chicken, with salad, spread, and with just exceptional squeezed grapefruit juice.  Love sitting at the counter facing out, put my feet up (you'll see), all's fine except the fact both times I thought to myself, this place needs a fan or a couple, slow setting is fine, but gotta get the airflow going.  

Second time had the sausage, mmm, think it could been fried/browned a bit more, and the inside was just warm, so maybe finish in the oven would be better, the hummus (I think) was not seemingly day-fresh, had a bit of congealed look, bread and salad fine.  Again, the drink:  chilled apple juice, really nice.

So why only 3 stars?  Well, I'm just a bit affronted (yes, affronted, so I can be better typecast as all too sensitive snob) by the service.  Yeahhhh, I know, the place has got a homey feel about it, and everyone's quite chill, but who doesn't like service that aims to please.  It's not quite a tavern, is it?  Yeah the front of house service have a real rough edge to them, kinda take it or leave it feel, here it is, eat up.  Remember it's just a feeling, it's not actually verbalized, no one ever says it.  Again, I'm not at a tavern, yet the service reminds me of service I have received at taverns, dives, ya know, places on strip malls, pit stops.  

So why not hire some friendly, service-oriented, fun, maybe young service staff who are not quite seemingly embittered or so hardened.  It's not that the staff seem like they've done time, but they've, ya know, seen \"stuff\".

Recap:  Food, good; service, rough.  Needs fans, younger friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Super cute neighbourhood joint with a small menu but great food and amazing service. I came here on Friday night with a friend of mine and was delighted with my meal. The menu's small, with only five entrees to choose form (two veggie, three meaty) and a few appetizers, but everything sounded great and the options I chose were delicious. My friend and I shared the cheese plate, which is a pretty healthy portion size, and I had pork and apple sausages while my friend has a hazelnut veggie loaf.

They're quite good about accommodating gluten-free folk -- gluten-free crackers with the cheese plate, mentioning on the menu when a sauce or gravy is gluten-free, etc.

Our server was incredibly friendly and provided quick service. He was also really quite good at accommodating the large groups that came in after us."}
{"text":"Every visit I am impressed, made with good quality, local ingredients...and love. Yup, you can taste all that goodness! Menu changes often, and never bores. The owner & staff are super friendly, and make great suggestions (if you're having trouble deciding). 
Taste good, and feels good to support them."}

When Zocalo first made an appearance at Bloor and Symington, locals and visitors had to wonder: \"How long will this place last?\"

Nestled in between a convenience store and a row of broken down homes, a trendy restaurant with a romantic evening decor had about as much chance as, well, tits on a bull.

Zocalo has proven what idealists talk about, but no one ever sees: quality, good food, and a spectacular product has met with success. It is frequently packed, and the place is doing better than anyone expected.
First, note the prices. They've managed to offer gourmet flavoured appetizers and entrees at around $10 each. This place puts high-end restaurants to shame with such fair and delicious pricing. The value is unbeatable.

There is no better service in this city. There is hardly better food. I've been here a number of times: the homemade sausage, the pot pies, the cheese plates, the broken bread platters... it's all inventive, tasty, and absolutely worth it.

I love this restaurant. I hope it never changes!

5 Stars"}
{"text":"Zocalo is a great addition to the Junction Triangle community although I find that the hype of many reviewers to me seems a bit hyperbolic. 

\"Deconstructed sandwiches\" which is what we used to call make your own is basically the premise of what is on offer. A lot of effort has been made to create plates that are organic, interesting, and sharable---- that's the best way to eat here, everybody buy a different dish and then everybody share. As a social activity this is hard to beat and overall the service, presentation, and vibe is warm.

Putting aside all the fun though, I found the food bland, especially the sausage. This shocked me considering how much care had obviously gone into preparing the food. The ingredient pairings were ok but lacking in pizazz or wow. I kept matching things up and waiting for a great taste but it never came. I also found the portions small, meaning that you almost need 2 dishes per person to feel you are having a proper dinner. Don't visit if you are hungry and short on cash. Visit with a group for an afternoon or after show snack. 

I cant say that I liked the complete lack of decor either. It works in some places but in a narrow place like this it makes everything really loud and on our first visit we left because the music was really loud and the second time we were forced to hear two people at the bar drone on about themselves. Some art from local artists or even some minimal sound breaks would cure this issue and create a space that is cozy instead of boomy. 

I'll drop by again in the future more for the fun than the food, give it a try and decide for yourself, at least you will have a good time sampling."}
{"text":"I went with a close friend and shared two broken sandwich plates. We loved it. I've never ate something like this before, the two meals were like deconstructed sandwiches or two platters with a selection of many delicious things (delicious salad, bread, meat and mash). I think it was autumn when we ate there since I remember eating root veg mash and a delicious meatloaf. The food was also seasonal and local. It was extremely delicious (sooo good) and we were also satisfied since it seemed like the amount of food was perfect for us, not too little but not too much to make you want to roll home (convenient because that area is hilly). I read in another review that the size of the plates have shrunk over the years and that's a shame. Honestly, I wouldn't argue if there were a few more bites because it was so good! It's also very affordable! We accidentally ordered a cookie with our coffees (due to miscommunication with the server, who was initially rude but made an effort to be nice later) but I wouldn't suggest getting it because it was really dry, crusty and flavourless."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place, but I ended up just liking it.  I'm giving four stars because I don't want to hurt the current rating and I think there's lots of hope for this resto to really pull it out of the water and deserve a solid four stars.

My friend and I were there on Tuesday night this week and sat at the bar.  I'm really glad we did because the service we received was really good.  When we ordered, we mentioned we were sharing and our server cleverly put our order - 3 entrees - on one lovely platter.  This is the way to eat at Zocalo!  You can order things on their own and you may not want to make a whole meal out of it - like the lovely cottage cheese cake or the terrine of mushrooms.  The asparagus is delicious and so was the sausage. However, if it all comes together and you get a bite of this and that, it makes a much more interesting meal.  Pair with some good beer (Beau's Lug Tread at a mere $5.75/pint) and you're gold.  The price points of the entrees ($10-$13) make it worthwhile ordering more for variety's sake.

The decor is nice and comfy - hip without a lot of junk 'objets' laying about.  Bathrooms are very nice and clean.  The crowd was pretty mixed up - all types of folks all having a good time.  Love that they accept Amex.  Also love that they have a back patio - too cold when we were there, but it looks nice.

There were a few issues with the service, but it wasn't our server - just another one with a bad attitude who was a bit distracting.

Anyways, I'll definitely be back as it's a nice find in our neighbourhood.  I'm sure they'll work out the shortcomings service-wise.  Fingers crossed, Zocalo!"}
{"text":"This place is very unique. We've had only good experiences and not just with the food but the staff is wonderful too. Food is very fresh, super flavourful and so nicely priced. Even the coffee is good here! It's one of those places where every bite makes you say \"mmmmm\" and it's healthy and clean tasting food as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Run by the friendliest couple of restaurateurs I've had the pleasure to meet, Zocalo was the site of my 21st birthday (thanks mom and dad!).  

Tucked between a convenience store and some rowhouses, Zocalo's location at Bloor and Symington is just a little out of the way, but so worth it.  Their decor is spare by homey, with just a few tables and a bar.  Service was quick and pleasant, and our servers (the owners of the place) were sweet, informative, and knowledgeable.

We ordered the home-canned salmon, which came in a tiny mason jar, along with warm, nutty brown bread.  The flavours were subtle and surprising: the salmon had a tinge of green onion and horseradish, and the bread was solid and filling.

For the main course, I had the poached eggs, which were, well, poached eggs.  Nothing to write home about, but very good.  They came with a side of spicy fresh greens in a light vinaigrette, and candied onion relish, which was superb, especially when daubed on a piece of egg and eaten on the aforementioned brown bread.

I'd give Zocalo five stars, but it's a bit out of my regular price range as a student.  Still, well worth the trip and the cash if you've got it- I last ate there about nine months ago and just writing this review has made me hungry for their food again! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Toronto! I've eaten here many times, and it is such a great spot: unassuming, comfortable, affordable, and charming. The menu is usually a kind of fancier spin on home cooking, and there is always a great vegetarian option or two (which makes planning group dinners easy). Can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"A great selection of local foods.  The cheese plate was amazing.  They have even sorted out some alternatives for food allergies.  I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I came to Zocalo with a group of 5 and we decided to split all their entrees between us, with a few additions from their sides. They brought the meal on two large platters, stuffed high with all kinds of food. The flavours were exceptional - many different sorts of meat, cheese, bread, vegetables, even fruit. We alternated between making sandwiches and just taking bites of our own combinations. We didn't leave overly stuffed but each of us were satisfied with the many different dishes we tried. The staff was very friendly although the large crowd of their friends at the bar was a bit noisy. I recommend going in a group and splitting food - you'll be very pleased at how many different dishes you can make for the price."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here last week - it was really nice. A quaint little spot - but every table was full.  The food was so unique and 'home-cooked'. The bread is really good and the meatballs were fantastic. We enjoyed and will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome, modern comfort food with great seasonal menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Zocalo twice now and wanted to write a review. The people that work here are so personable and friendly. A really great place to bring those visiting from out of town! Its a teeny neighbourhood establishment with delicious food and great wine. My only wish is that it was bigger so we could bring more people!

My boyfriend and I are adventurous eaters but the people we dined with both times are quite picky. The picky eaters loved everything! Hows that for validation?"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced... love this place!! Just make a reservation if you're trying to get in on a weekend."}
{"text":"We live nearby and it's become a staple ever since we started going.

Their homemade quiche, sausages, pates and relishes are the best! 

Inside it's a little small and dark, but in the evening they light candles which gives it a nice atmosphere.
Also, sometimes the service has been hit and miss, this is my only qualm: at times I have came in and waited 15min to be served even when the place is empty. And once we went to get coffees and sit down but they made up change seats for a reservation  when they could have just told us in the first place.

All in all we love it! :]"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food was nice. The sausage and hummus were flavorful and I especially enjoyed the acidity of the chocolate dessert. The terrine was the only let-down. It's not really supposed to be brick hard.

The real problem was the service... Went there with two friends and had a nice meal but at the end the waitress messed up one of the credit card payments (without mentioning the issue). Then she proceeded to make it sound like we tried to short-change her. We waited politely for her to show us what happened. She went to \"find the receipt\" for the transaction that was supposedly canceled but stopped to chat with other customers and take orders while we were awkwardly waiting with our coats on. Then she said she had thrown it into the trash (really? aren't you supposed to keep those? give me a copy?) and could not find it. Then the owner came by saying that the transaction had disappeared from their machine. Ok, she was nice but they were making kind of a scene out of something that should have been handled with grace and efficiency. I ran my card again while she assured us over and over: \"we'd never think of charging anyone twice. We don't do that.\". Took some restraint not to say: right, because WE DO think of running half-brained scams at restaurants. My friends and I go, eat, pay 2/3 of the bill, pull some kind of Jedi mind trick that makes your waitress throw the receipts in the trash and then we wait politely around to be humiliated by your unprofessional staff. Yep lady, that's our idea of fun on a Saturday night. UGH

That said I do hope they sort out their wait staff attitude problems because the food is worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a friend and her 1 year-old  a few weeks ago. A lovely little spot, with a small but nicely curated menu. The food was excellent, though portions were a bit small. They didn't have a high-chair for the baby, but were very tolerant and the server was happy to engage with her."}
{"text":"Zocalo is a fantastic cafe/restaurant located in the junction triangle.  Located at Bloor and Symington it is nestled perfectly into the area.  Street parking is available on Symington.  

Paul and Heather are lovely people and they have an adorable dog, Atlas=) the restaurant is so quant, warm, cozy and inviting.  The counter tops are beautifully worn reclaimed barn boards and the bar has immaculate detailing.   The music and atmosphere are always great.  The menu is small but amazing.  Most things are made in house and use the most interesting flavour combinations.   Prices ranging from $5 appetizers to $10 for broken bread sandwiches.   I have sampled every item and on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The menu changes frequently.  Fresh local ingredients are always utilized.  Various cheese plates, house made pickles, nuts and breads with hummus occupy the tappas portion of the menu.  Entrees include: different stews, broken bread sandwiches and soups.  The fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade in the summer is so refreshing.  This is the perfect spot to go on a romantic first date or catch up with an old friend at=) They also have a small brunch menu and offer various hot beverages/baked goods in the morning.  Yum!  Amazing food, amazing people and a strong sense of community at Zocalo. 

I highly recommend this cafe! 

But make um understand its Westside foe life!
Thanks so much for your time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the city, every time I have eaten here the food and service has been excellent. Sometimes I wonder why I don't eat here more often as it is so close to home. The menu changes every season so the food always compliments the time of year that you are there. The prices are also very reasonable, main dishes for around $10. If you haven't been here yet you really should check it out!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, wholesome food! Upon entering this small eatery, you are welcomed by the earth-tone and wood ambience and the warm and friendly staff! I have never eaten anything here that I didn't like. They do a mean brunch, lunch and dinner. 
The menu changes seasonally and brings new delights. Lots of veg friendly options."}
{"text":"I had been staying in downtown TO so was happy to escape and get to try something different so my friend Julia drove and we hit up Zocalo. 

It's a nice little spot in a neighborhood away from the bustle and has a nice short menu that apparently changes quite often.  The food was great and I had the chicken hearts and pork.  Service was attentive and they had some good local options for beer as well to compliment your meal.

The best part was dessert!  I am not sure what it was but it was delish!"}
{"text":"Damn I love this place.
Great drinks, food and staff.

Almost all their entries can be easily converted to gluten free (swapping bread for Mary's GF crackers) and the staff are aware of the severity of cealic disease & what's in the food. Awesome.

It's a place I'm comfortable coming to with a group of friends for drinks - or taking my folks to a nice casual dinner.

There's a nice little patio in the back, though it's a bit of a maze to find the first time.
Depending on the time of day it may be a quiet resturant with just a few tables of dinner, or totally packed with people having light snacks and drinking."}
{"text":"I've been to Zocalo twice now, and after the last visit I felt compelled to write. 

First of all (and most importantly), the food is delicious. They have recently changed their menu for January and it is full of warm, hearty and winter-esque meals. I had the beef and bacon meatloaf with root mash and cranberry compote. It comes with arugula and artisan bread. For only $10, it felt like a steal. Add a cup of daily soup for $3. 

On top of that, my friend had the spaghetti squash and aged cheddar stew with crumble on top and a cornmeal muffin on the side. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely be ordering that next time. 

Small little joint with a relaxed vibe. Can get a little cold near the door on a winter night. Service is just average. Not bad, but not amazing either. We easily found parking on the side street. 

Zocalo can be counted on for consistently delicious food at excellent prices. Even better still is the fact they often change the menu, and the food is obtained both locally and from well-raised sources. Make sure you check this spot out."}
{"text":"This small little nondescript cafe on Bloor near Perth is such a hidden gem !

With only a few tables we were lucky to have a seat around 1230Saturday afternoon. 

It's not your typical brunch fare. I would say more the lunch side of things than breakfast. Their menu was filled with unique pairings including the open faced beef and bacon and bone marrow loaf I got. I asked for gluten free bread (I like to when I have a choice) and he gladly gave me Mary's Crackers on the side. 

It was tasty but I secretly wished I got the poached eggs with vintage cheese !

Ada T got herself the daily leek and mushroom quiche made out of oat and spelt crust. Tasty and crunchy. 
For dessert we got bread pudding stuffed  with apples and sour cream. 
It was a perfect ending. 

I did notice others got sharing platters of different foods and ate off one tray. What a great idea. Would like to try that on a day im not sick ! 

Menu items were $8-10 with coffee and was about $12 a person. 

Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"I am updating my review to reflect that Zocalo is quite possibly my favourite restaurant in Toronto. 

Incredible food. Amazing prices. Homemade sausages, roasted root veggies, raw milk cheeses from Quebec, and a great wine list 

This place reminds me of my favorite restaurant in NYC called Vinegar Hill House, a former brownstone with a fireplace, low basement ceilings, and a beautiful bar. Zocalo has the same cozy feel and homemade cooking style. I only wish that Zocalo were bigger - the tables are quite small and close together.

Prices are unbetable, particularly for the high quality of food being served. Salads are in the $10 range, sausages and other mains around $12 and everything is local and delicious. They even make their own spelt crackers for the cheese plates! Bottles of wine are in the $35 range. Very reasonable. 

Zocalo, can you buy the house next door and expand? Thanks."}
{"text":"Cozy.  Minimalist.  Quaint.  Delicious.  \"Deconstructed\".  

All of these words apply to Zocalo, yet I'm at a loss to find words appropriate to really describe this little resto at Bloor & Symington.

\"Fabulous\" is perhaps most apt, maybe even \"peerless\", with a perfect union of venue, vibe, food, drink, and the people behind it all.  Zocalo really is one of those spots foodies must visit, even when terms like \"must visit\" are bandied about most frivolously by reviewers all the time; I'm guilty of it myself.  No hyperbole here, though!  Zocalo is the real deal.  If you have yet to visit, push them to the top of your list.

Featuring \"broken sandwich\" plates perfect for sharing, they're all about fresh, seasonal, local ingredients, often vegetarian (but often not).  When \"not\", the dearly departed animals are of the \"happy\" variety: free range, organic, and the like.  Co-owner Paul seems particularly pleased with this, and he should be -- while free range is all the rage these days, I didn't actually see it bragged about on the menu.  Quality is just a matter of course at Zocalo, not pride, which is refreshing.  They are who they are, simple as that, even if at times I felt as though they might even be a bit... bashful(?) regarding their obvious excellence.

So, how about some recommendations:

*  Splurge on as many add-ons as you can afford (easy, as the prices are curiously reasonable).  Half a sausage here, a side salad with your soup there, or maybe a poached egg with your sandwich (which is actually two poached eggs, for a great little secret).  For an inspired combo, get their seasonal soup with salad and poached egg, and note that it's a big mess of meticulously arranged food for a mere $13.

*  Yes, the toutiere sausage on the fall menu is great.  Yes, that's clove you taste.  Yes, it goes splendidly with their cauliflower hummus and its hint of anise.

*  Their coffee is awesome.  A double Americano rivals any I've had (and I've been having a lot lately), and serves as the perfect bookend to a perfect meal (start, finish, or both!).  My first was served by Heather, the other co-owner, and it was pleasing watching the obvious care with which she created it -- barista skills, yes!

*  When you learn what their daily cheese special is, order it; or, if you're feeling frisky, ask what the backup cheese is for when they (inevitably?) run out:  order it, too.  It (or they) will come with some of the best candied almonds you'll ever eat.

*  Don't come if you're famished.  Service takes its time, so if you're prone to panic attacks when waiting longer than 15 minutes, have a nibble before hand.  The wait is more than worth it (even if you require meds to cope).

And now for a little inside scoop:

While their patio wasn't ready this year, it's all good to go for next.  So take this little tip: watch the calendar come Spring and call ahead to learn when it'll be open.  Be amongst the first to celebrate its reveal!  I know who's patio I'll be frequenting, that's for sure!

To say I was blown away by Zocalo would be an understatement.  This is what food is all about.  I am thrilled to say they're one of the best parts of the 'hood in which I live... 

May they enjoy a long, fruitful existence!"}
{"text":"omg! delicious! jerk sausage is amazing. chocolate cake is solid sin."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch, tasty and healthy, reasonably priced, awesome staff, cute place with fresh-cut flowers... what more do I need? Nothing."}
{"text":"Came back here for dinner and it did not disappoint. We shared hummus, meatballs, chicken salad broken sandwich, home canned trout, and they were all great. The lamb meatballs especially stood cuz with all the flavours and juicyness. Also finished the night off with a hazelnut carrot cake - yum!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought sandwiches you have to build yourself would work so well? Well they do. Also you don't actually build the sandwiches, you just jam all their deconstructed contents into your mouth. I love this place. The food is great, the interior charming, and the staff lovely. They serve good coffee, also a bonus. On the weekends they serve brunch, which adds poached eggs, bread pudding, and a quiche to their menu. All these things are good. This place is good."}
{"text":"Returned today for lunch. The food was effing FANTASTIC. 

I had the house-made crimini mushroom and steak sausage with corn hummus, salad, bread and potato salad. It was very fresh, tasty and light. My friend had a similar dish with grilled peaches, peppers, hummus and almonds. This is exactly the way I like to eat, especially in the summer. 

I'm adding a star from my last visit, because this time I was for reals blown away by the food, and got to experience the cute an summery backyard patio. 

Service however remains harried and could be more attentive, although there was no bad vibes as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"This place is lovely and very high quality with homemade crackers and pickles. I was surprised that the cheese plate only had one kind of cheese, but the one they had was totally delicious.

I was also thrilled that they had delicious wine to pair with the cheese. 

The atmosphere is very welcoming and our waiter was really lovely and accommodating even though I was a bit braindead before I ordered.

Also, I went there with two lovely ladies who have gluten/wheat allergies and they were both able to happily ordered delicious foods. I highly recommend the apple hummus!

In short, you should come here for a cozy date or for a good quality talk with your best friends."}
{"text":"wow. visiting from Los Angeles - a friend recommended this place reconsidering reverting back to vegetarianism after eating here! also: I'm gluten free and dairy free and they had a bunch of delicious options for me."}
{"text":"We came here LATE on a saturday afternoon for brunch ... they have brunch service until 4pm and it was packed. The place is tiny/cozy so it very much sets the atmosphere. Luckily a huge table was leaving so we were seated right away .... the service was great and the coffee phenomenal. Unluckily it's not free refills but for $2-someting an americano, it's worth it! 

There's a huge assortment of cookies/breads ... so the main dishes stood out. We saw the table next to us do a \"sharing\" plate so we opted for the same. So it comes in a huge platter? Bread and salad greens (very yummy dressing) ... and then we shared the almond/hummus/roasted squash + 2 poached eggs/a ball of cheese spread/candied apples (the apples were the only thing kinda gross -- it was super smushy/soggy??). They were nice enough to bring extra breads when requested! So this place is a bit far and out of the way? But I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Had a really fantastic meal here with friends for a birthday a few weeks ago.  I have only positive things to say about the food!

There was a problem with the service, though.  Our server was friendly, but abruptly let us know we had to leave shortly after we paid the bill, because they needed the table.  We still had unfinished drinks on the table when we were told to leave.  And it wasn't a \"hey, if you could clear out soon...\", rather she made it clear we had already been there too long.  This happened directly after we paid for our meal and had already tipped her.

If they had a reservation waiting directly after ours, we should have been given a heads up before we ordered desert, or the wine we weren't welcome to stay and finish (well, I mean, we chugged it, but that's not exactly responsible service either).

There was another large table next to ours (larger than ours) that was there when we got there and there when we left.  The time between courses was also kinda long.  It's not something that bothered me until we were told we had to get out, but none of the deserts we ordered were warm (I had a cold pudding served in a mason jar and some others at my table had cookies) but they still took a good 20 minutes coming out from the kitchen.  If you want to turn tables over quickly, it's pretty hard to rush people out when the service for the pre-prepared stuff is that slow.

I would probably return again for the food, but I'd be really put off if we had another bad experience with the service."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and loved the food! The atmosphere was casual, crowded and the service was friendly and laid back.

The house-made sausage was awesome, and the best thing on the plate.. but everything was good! The quiche is also worth trying. The bloody mary tasted unique but in a good way!"}
{"text":"This low key neighbourhood eatery is the kind of place aspiring chefs-at-home should visit regularly. The menu is simple in that \"I can totally make this at home!\" way, yet will unfailingly manage to inspire you in your own kitchen by showing you creative flavour combinations.

My first visit to Zocalo was in the midst of last year's very hot summer. I was impressed right off the bat by the friendly server's offering of freshly made iced tea. Not only was it made to order, it was also sweetened to my liking. I almost had regrets of not ordering my own after tasting a spoonful of my lunch date's soup of the day, but quickly changed my mind when my humongous deconstructed chicken salad sandwich arrived. It both looked and tasted delicious.

Apparently, the winter menu is now in effect. Sounds like the perfect time to go back for some new inspiration!"}
{"text":"I went to Zocalo the first time for a family birthday dinner and was impressed, but for some reason forgot to review it.  I returned this weekend for a quick bite and a couple pints.  Here's my thoughts:

The menu isn't huge, but it has enough to appeal to both carnivores and veggies.  After walking the Ex on Saturday, I wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal, so I opted for the cheese tray.  The portion size wasn't huge, but it was damn tasty and I really enjoyed it, especially with a couple ciders to off set the cheddar.  I watched as other tables got their meals and concluded that each plate looked nicely curated.  Not in a pretentious plated way; just that ingredients looked well considered and they were simply presented.  That's kind of refreshing.

I also feel that for the quality of food, the pricing is really good.  Don't you hate it when you find a cute place and look at the menu and nearly fall over at the price they are asking for a glass of wine?  I can think of a number of establishments in my hood that are notorious for that.  It always burns me, but here there is no gouging at all.  If this place was closer to me, I would be here often."}
{"text":"I tried the quiche here and it was very healthy and a bit out of the ordinary. The texture was chewy per say... the dish was very green as it was served with a small salad and tomato relish. The inside is very small and cozy with free wifi! I plan to go back and try their sandwiches soon enough. But overall, a nice place to read a book and relax by yourself."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Feels more like your best friend cooking for you than a resto, this place is intimate, cozy, friendly and fresh.

My friend recently moved into the hood and introduced me to this wonderful spot for a fine and hearty meal. The dishes had a \"homemade\" quality to them and the staff were friendly and attentive. The space is rustic with old wooden tables and chairs, and has a warm glow about it with its dim incandescent lighting. The owners could easily charge a few dollars more per dish and the value would still be amazing (having said that, for some things, change isn't a good thing).

As if you need another reason to come back, their menu frequently changes. I had their pork and prune meatballs served with a greens and a side of a walnut and whipped garlic spread and their cup 'o' soup. My friend ordered their free-range chicken with bacon jam. yes, BACON JAM.

A \"hidden gem\", so to speak, Zocalo is a perfect place to catch up with good friends or impress a date and/or significant other."}
{"text":"A small cozy spot, nice wooden tables and chairs, bar seating and great paintings on the walls.  The selection has interesting options: veggie soup, cheese plate, hummus, vegetable plate.  The mains had sausage, lamb, chicken, and some vegetarian dishes.

A small menu, and it seems the kitchen is having fun with the dishes.  

Obviously a place for leisurely dinner with friends - when it's packed it gets loud."}
{"text":"I love living literally within sight of this place.

It is such a consistently delicious, unpretentious, and inventive place at the perfect price. The menu seems to change a couple times a season and is always a nice reflection to the weather. Great staff, great atmosphere.

Zocalo is also a great place to bring friends who aren't too adventurous or your parents, so you can have something tasty, and they won't be scared off.

Still haven't had their brunch, but look forward to checking it out soon enough."}
{"text":"I gathered here on account of a friend's (surprise) birthday party.

The staff here were quite lovely.  They made extra space for us in the back to congregate & apologized profusely when someone had accidentally booked a large reservation overlapping with us.  & there were pickled appetizers to sweeten (?) the deal.  Delicious.

I was so satiated by my meal.  It was perfectly portioned & yummy.  It felt so unpretentious - just basic foods paired together for maximum flavor.

I'll definitely be returning."}
