{"text":"Place is Sh*t. Egg rolls were soggy. The crab rangoon was cold. The Hot and sour soup was greasy. How you make greasy soup is beyond me.  And finally the Chicken in garlic sauce not only covered everything in the bag when I finally got it out, but after I took the lid off I realized it was 90% oil. Some garlic sauce. I called to inform them of the issue,  and all they said was you already have your order there's nothing we can do. Well what I can do is drive over there and dump this crap all over your cash register. 40 dollar waste"}
{"text":"The reviews made me even more excited to try this place and see what it was all about. Weirdest place ever? Convenience store? Hmm, a mysterious Chinese place, let's give it a try. And what a pleasant surprise to find that it was much better than anticipated!   We had the crab wontons, which were...crab wontons. Pretty delicious as always, though the cream cheese didn't have a ton of crab in it compared to some others. Both of us got dinner combos, which should be clearer about the drink/egg roll choice. I would have taken the egg roll then bought a drink, had I known! But we still left with leftovers. Sesame chicken was good, so was the General Tsos. The broccoli was a nice touch, steamed and not drowned in sauce. Overall I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delivery took forever. Sesame chicken was dry. Crab rangoons were just not. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Love the new management and staff. My favorite dishes are general tso's chicken and crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"Well, their website is still up, and taking orders for delivery, but they are \"closed until August 1, 2012\" according to their answering machine.  Glad I waited 1:15 to call and check on the order. This is basic stuff: closing your restaurant for a while? Update your website. F as in Fail. Epic Fail."}
{"text":"Has it closed down? we've been  trying to order, but nobody answers? If anyone knows please post it. Thank you.   we love this place :-("}
{"text":"I have only been to this relatively new restaurant twice, but both times I enjoyed it very much.  So far it is the best I have tried in the neighborhood.  I should probably characterize it more as a carry-out place than a restaurant since I think I remember it having at most eight shared seats at one table.  Mostly the seating is for Children's Hospital workers to come in for a quick lunch.  Otherwise the business is all carry-out and unfortunately no delivery except to the hospital.  The prices are reasonable, the preparation is very fast and the flavors are very good.  The appetizers I am not overjoyed by, but every Pittsburgh Chinese restaurant has mediocre appetizers.  The fried dishes like General Tso's are fried well and have a good coating and the pan-fried dishes like Kung Po and Black Bean Sauce are cooked well, have a flavorful sauce and have fine quality meat that they dont skimp on.  I do not recommend the fried rice at any Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I think every restaurant must buy it frozen in a bag because it all looks and tastes exactly the same and has very rubbery meat that is different than the meat in all the other dishes."}
{"text":"Very average Chinese take-out. My tofu entree came with only 2 pieces of tofu, while my boyfriend's general tso's chicken portion was double the size. Delivery was REALLY fast- less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Food here isn't bad. And very inexpensive.  Anytime my kid has to go to childerns we go here."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here, got two dinner boxes ($9 each), hot and sour soup-large ($5) and the fried chicken wing appetizer ($6). The soup was good and the large is enough to feed 3-4 people. The chicken wings were fried to perfection and remained crispy even after a drive home. The dinner boxes were your typical Chinese takeout foods (general tsao chicken, shrimp in a spicy sauce, beef and broccoli) served with fried rice and a pork egg roll. Got a ton of food, this was probably enough to feed 4 people for about $30, so a good deal. Fast service too, about 15 minutes. I wish the food was a little more authentic Chinese and I certainly wouldn't eat here too often because I get tired of that generic Chinese takeout flavor, but I'll definitely order takeout again when I'm too tired to cook."}
{"text":"This is actually pretty good Chinese food at a reasonable price. I can't comment on the General Tsao's chicken, which of course isn't actually Chinese food. I wish they didn't even bother to offer it, because they do simple stir fries so well, but I guess that's what people expect. Give the beef with mixed vegetables or the shredded beef with chinese hot peppers."}
{"text":"After going back-and-forth on Yelp about where I would fix my General Tso's tofu craving, I noticed a brief mention of a new offering nearby that I hadn't heard of... So of course, I threw all the places that had been on my to-try list out the window and called up Green Bamboo..  First off, parking at this place is kind of tough. The streets off of Penn are extremely tight and parking is a rarity. There is a small lot across the street not for them, but you could probably get away with picking up. I stopped in the street and put on my flashers and I was fine.  Second off, this place is a convenience store or something.. I can't tell. I walked in thinking I went in the wrong door and there was a younger(teenage) kid sitting there. I looked at him confused and just said \"tofu?\" and he told me to grab a bag that was sitting out, and told me to check if everything was in it. I understand I'm not at a 3-star restaurant or anything, but seriously?  I had to grab my own food and check it?  Oh well... My order of General Tso's tofu, veggie egg rolls, and a side fried rice order came to about $18.  The first thing I tried was the eggroll, which came as two spring rolls. The wrapping was good, but when it was bit into, the inside yielded nothing but fried cabbage and black pepper. Not very appealing, and quite flavorless. On to the fried rice, it was dry, but had a strong oil taste to it(This was a theme), so after eating it my mouth would feel and taste like the oil they used to cook in, but the other flavors were not prominent.  Finally, on to the general tso's, the tofu for this I thought was fried pretty well - soft and fluffy, but firm enough to stay together. They had large chunks that I didn't like and the sauce left a lot to be desired... It was also like they dipped it in sauce to coat it and gave it to me, because the only liquid that wasn't a thin layer of sauce on the tofu was oil. Upon biting into the tofu, the story was much the same as the fried rice - a short burst of sweetness followed by the flavor of oil.  Was it god-awful americanized chinese? Not particularly - it's always a gamble, but there are many places in the area still on my list, so green bamboo will not get a second chance for a while. Also I thought it was a little expensive for what we got but hey"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way to downtown. The staff greeted me as I walked in, they were kind. The restaurant has tables to sit at, both upstairs and downstairs (curiosity got the best of me, I asked where the steps went to). I wasn't sure what to try, so the staff suggested their Honey Chicken with chicken fried rice. The order took just a few minutes to prepare, so I decided to just sit and eat at the restaurant. The food was brought out on a fancy white plate (I didn't expect that). The chicken and the rice were hot, freshly prepared. The honey chicken was sweet and fried to perfection. The rice was tasty and had thick, fresh slices of onion. I tried my best, but couldn't eat all of the food- the portion was huge. I was quite impressed by this place. The prices were very reasonable and the quantity was enough for my lunch, and now, my dinner. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try it because I've been across the street at the hospital with my son. Ordered house lo mein.. It could've been more flavorful but it was standard Chinese fare , not exceptionally great but definately edible and better than cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Stale fortune cookies with a side of putrid food quality conveniently delivered to a location near you."}
{"text":"I kept seeing menus at my apartment for this place. So today, I said, oh what the heck lets do something different to satisfy the chinese food craving. Although General Tso's is a westernized thing, the American Chinese can do an amazing job with this dish. Hit or miss. This place , was a miss. The chicken was very salty, greasy and the sauce was very oily. I'm not sure if the chicken was actually made, or placed in the freezer and nuked.  No broccoli in this dish, oh wait, I had ONE, about the size of a teaspoon. The rice was very plain, bland no flavor, had like two peas, and a few sprigs of bean sprouts. The eggroll I got with my General tso's was really bad. I think it was also old, it had  that flavor you normally can smell when vegetables go bad. You know the kind you smell when you bought a thing of tomatoes , leave it in the fridge too long , or forget about it. All around awful. I should of just stuck to pizza.  Never spending a dime here again."}
