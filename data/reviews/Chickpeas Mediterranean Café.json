{"text":"Horrible customer service.  First time trying this place based on a flyer in the mail.  We love Mediterranean food so we thought we give it a shot.  Unfortunately upon calling in an 3 item order for delivery they didn't have the pizza listed (no big deal) so we opted for a different item.  After 30 mins they called back and said they didn't have the Mediterranean burger we originally ordered as well, so we asked to please omit the burger and continue the order.  One hour later still no delivery so I called in to check on the food and they said that the driver had left over 20 mins ago and should be there soon. (we live 5 mins away). We waited an additional 30 mins (a total of 2 hours) called in again and was told the food had in fact been delivered, which we definitely did not receive.  With attitude the woman i spoke to did not believe we didn't get the food and could care less about the whole situation.  So I asked for a cancellation, luckily I was going to pay with cash.  I don't think she would have refunded a credit card had that been the case.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"The food here is so good that I think about for days after eating it. It is 6am, and I wish I had some now."}
{"text":"This location just opened up right across from the building I work in, and I must say the food is absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are huge! They dont cut back when it comes to the meats. The workers there are also very friendly and nice which is always a plus! I will definitley be paying them a visit soon with all of my coworkers (although I find myself coming back even when I am off) :) Overall a great little spot with great food, great portions and great service!! I highly reccommend!"}

The price is very affordable and it's a very clean food also!!!! I will give 5 stars !!!! I live in Green valley and I drive all the way here in summerlin just to eat in this place !!!!

{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in town. Place is very nice and clean, portions are big and the food is just amazing! I go there every chance I get and order their food for all my parties ( great catering services). My little girls love the chicken kabob!!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good here. Healthy & fresh. Everything here is made here. Staff is helpful & friendly. Defined would come back here again. Try for yourself"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch... had the beef kebab lunch special. Food was great but the service was a little cold... overall though, very happily with what the $8.95 got me."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Chickpeas opened up a new location! A great destination for quality Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. Tasty Gyro and shawarmas are best. Great service."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious mediterranean food. Wanted to eat something other than Archi's Thai food (in the same complex) and this is the perfect place. Quick friendly service. Ordered an appetizer and a shawarma bowl to share with hubby and had left overs! Love the yogurt cream sauce and house dressing."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was bland... wish they had garlic sauce or something to add flavor to their meats"}
{"text":"My first experience here was great, the food was fresh and the service was excellent. I decided to bring some friends a few days later and the food was not the same. They took out the chicken and beef shawarma from the fridge and cook it on a small grill. While the other day it was slowly roasting on a vertical broiler.  The chicken was stale and the beef was bland. There are no seasoning on the rice, which lack flavor. I did enjoy their cucumber salad and hummus. Other than that, I will not be going back.  Update: as the comment stated below the recipes never change, and I highly doubt it will change for whatever reason. I doubt I am that special, that a restaurant will change their recipe for me. But I had the chicken shawarma that I enjoy before and the beef was the first time I had that day to be more clear. The chicken was cooked on the grille because it could be cook quicker as you stated. Why was I not inform of this information? Would it not alter the taste of my food? If it was not the same standard as my usual great taste as you stated, why did you guys bother to serve it? Was it a convenient to serve a customer a food that is not on par with the usual. I don't understand why you guys couldn't just stated the chicken is not ready and will take time to cook, would you like something else. Instead of just serving it and not saying anything.   I will change my original stars from 3 to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is delicious and they are vegan friendly. It's neat, conveniently located and staff is nice. I think they should put a little bit of music to make it more enjoyable"}
{"text":"Absolute 100% waste of my time & money. Waited 20 minutes during lunch hour for salmon that was cooked on 3 different cook tops. Every time someone would place a lid over it to cook, someone else would walk by and remove the lid. I was asked on multiple occasions by different people what order I was waiting for, each time was a different excuse why it wasn't ready. They also f*cked up the other orders of the folks I went with. When I finally sat down to eat, the fish was flavorless and undercooked. The salad was also bland. Place wasn't busy but these people couldn't handle the few people in there. Save your time, money and food poisoning for another day, unless this is your thing. PS My credit card wasn't handed back to me at the end of the transaction. In fact, between the 3 of us that paid with a CC, 2 of us had each other's cards."}
{"text":"I don't like writing *** reviews but you Yelpers count on us to express our experience right? My co-workers keep telling me about \"Chickpeas\" how good it was... So I had to try it :) new location in SW close to 215W and Sunset  Ordered lunch for my team. Restaurant decor is nice and modern. A young man helped me ride away. Many options from bowls to salads to kabob. Looking at the precut veggies and all, I wasn't sure... I like the fact that they offer Small Medium or large portion. Their homemade salad dressing with olive oil and balsamic is yummy. I ordered  1 Beef plate that came with white rice, \"yellow\" rice, tomato lettuce, olives (enough to feed 2) 1 Lamb plate  1 falafel plate salad. the Falafel was fresh and fried while i was waiting for my order. Team got excited :) We were little disappointed even the food was good and portion generous (enough to share). Hummus and \"babaganoush\" roasted eggplant wasn't amazing. You know when so many speak highly about a place, you expect more ... it's how i feel about chickpeas. beef and lamb were little dry. The falafel was good. the mix of lettuce, tomato, red onions, feta and cucumber were delicious. I would suggest to peel the cucumber skin, it was too chewy and hard I prefer Meraki Greek Cafe.  adding a star because staff was nice even the owner said \"bye Sir\" lol it made me laugh... next time i will wear my mustache LOL"}
{"text":"Now Open! A wonderful new location for Chickpeas Mediterranean! Located off Rainbow/Sunset in the SW. This storefront previously was home to Rotisserie Chicken which didn't make the cut. Next door Greens and Proteins thrives, so it's nice to have a healthy Mediterranean option in the same plaza. The prices are affordable, their portions generous, and their variety of foods are flavorful. I will happily keep this as a good to lunch option!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Husband surprised me at work for Valentine's and brought food on my dinner break. He ordered salmon and salad and Babaganoush for me. Salmon was a bit dry but the salad made up for it! Veggies were fresh and crunchy! Dressing was flavorful. Babaganoush was creamy and not too garlicky like many others I've tasted. I definitely enjoyed that quick dinner as I was at work. It's very convenient that it's close to my workplace and they close late! Perfect for when I crave Greek food!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we choose to have lunch here absolutely satisfied! The food was delicious and fresh ! We had the ground beef mix with basmati rice and the beef bowl ! Will definitely be coming here more often"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch salmon with a salad. Giant salad portion but undercooked and terrible quality salmon."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is great. My husband and I stopped in to get a quick bite and were VERY pleased with the fresh flavors and variety of options. The  salads look and tastes amazing and did come with plenty of meat to share. The hubs said his gyro very good. The staff was very friendly and helpful and quick to get our food out to us. We will absolutely be back. :) P.S. Great Gluten Free options."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food so I was super excited for this place to open- too bad it really wasn't good... at all honestly. I could 100% make better at home.   We ordered the chicken barg and the shawarma; both of which were inclusive of over cooked rice and a lack of flavor. The rice had the texture of mashed potatoes- that's how over cooked it was. The chicken on both of our dishes just tasted like they were cooked with a dash of salt thrown on them- very bland considering chicken kabob is typically super seasoned and full of flavor.   2 stars because it was edible but wouldn't come back- go to Meraki, it's way better!"}
{"text":"Our server didn't have the best attitude, but the food was delicious! The interior was very appealing to the eyes, and the music was also very nice."}
{"text":"Located next to Greens and Proteins behind Starbucks, this place is easy to miss if you don't work in one of those nearby office spaces.   Ordered the ground chicken kebab lunch special which came with like 10 scoops of rice and 10 scoops of salad lol. Portion was huge but a little too much on the sides? Very bland and no flavor. I pretty much drenched everything in the giant bottle of balsamic vinegar and oil but still just meh. Boyfriend was going to order lamb but they were out so he didn't get anything. Disappointed because I love Mediterranean food and was excited to try this place.  Space itself is clean inside but small. They also offer a salad bar. I almost thought it was a sauce bar that I could just take things lol."}
{"text":"Staff seems very new so service is a little unorganized but the food is very good. I got the gyro sandwich special with fries and a drink. Price is good for the amount of food"}
{"text":"Found this place while I was driving and decided to give them a try. Ordered did which came with free hummus because my order was over $10. Hummus and salad were delivered first and they were very good. I was looking forward to the chicken Kabob, but it never came. I looked at my watch and it's been more than 20 minutes since I placed my order. Went back and and informed the staff that I have not received my food. They delivered a food to my table within 2 minutes. Food was warm at best and lacked the freshness that I was expecting from Mediterranean food. They failed to deliver quality food on my visit. I hope they read this and reconfigure their process."}
{"text":"My soup was cold, not warm, cold!  The fries were so undercooked with 0 seasoning they went straight in the trash, the chicken in the chicken sandwhich was fatty thigh meat and pretty bland.  Falafel was good and the hummus was ok.  I hadn't eaten all day and was really looking forward to dinner.  Ugh!  it was below avg and nothing close to good Mediterranean food.  Will not return"}
{"text":"It's really good! Impressed with their selection. Super fresh and healthy ingredients. Fast and delicious I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was about to grab a quick lunch to go at Greens & Proteins but saw Chickpeas Mediterranean right next door and thought I would give it a try.   I ordered the Salmon Salad lunch special and while I understand it takes a little time to cook salmon, I feel like 20 minutes to wait to receive my food from time I ordered seemed longer than it should take.  Although the taste of the salad and salmon (though they could definitely decrease the gob of garlic placed on top of the salmon - major garlic breath!) was just average/decent, they do give a good portion size of salmon and their lunch specials pricing were nice. I think pricing on items from regular menu seemed a bit high in comparison to other Mediterranean/Greek restaurants.   I did enjoy the cucumber water as I waited my for my to go order, but in the future, I'd rather go to other places for this same type of food (my fave is Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean) or just stick with Greens & Proteins next door."}
{"text":"It's pretty decent, but in comparison to Parsley, it's inferior in every way!  The money to food quality or even the portions at Parsley is worth it.  I'm always still hungry after Chickpeas.  I wasn't too found of some of the dishes they have available on the menu, not including the picture of other food that came with it.  It's very misleading and upsetting.  You value the price according to what you see that comes with it.  Also the breaks these guys take, it's frustrating, mostly kids from 16-26 or something that would rather text then serve ya.  I wouldn't come back.  Been here maybe 5 times total and didn't check in cuz I'd rather not spend my time doing so.  Go to Parsley up the street and get yourself better service, food, choices, and save you some money instead of eating at another spot RIGHT after eating here.  These 4 and 5 star ratings don't eat the other Mediterranean food here in town.  Again the food WASN'T bad, just not as good as some other places nor beats the price or choices they have."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic Mediterranean stop. We had the Shawarma bowl and Shawarma sandwich and both were amazing. Also they're ikra was to die for. Good bang for the buck a full lunch with some leftovers to take home at around 25 bucks. Very helpful and friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Great customer service , I order a take out and they were extremely slammed some how I got a beef swrammma instead of gyro and Shahin offered to delivery to my house the right order that was so thoughtful but since we are in a rush he went on ahead and gave me a  Credit for next time The food is alays fresh and the flavors are delicious I'm so happy to have a chickpeas location closer to me ! ! Keep Doing a Amazing Job!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Impressed with the food. The delivery is super fast. The best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Hot Mess !! Have absolutely no idea what they are doing . You pay for a lot of salad and very little meat"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I have tried the other location many times and I am glad to see they opened a second location. I am pro small business and I wish them a successful second location."}
{"text":"This time Rack of Lamb is available lamb was very tender and Greek Salad. Big plates it comes with grilled ground lamb it's good. Today's craving is Lamb good eats. Place is clean nice music server very nice."}
{"text":"I truly recommend chickpea!! Healthy mediterranean food!! This place is clean.. first thing you see when you walk in is the open kitchen.  Super clean and sanitary.   Owner is very friendly as well.  I love their shawarmas. Specially lamb one.  Juicy and tender.  Normally I spilt my shawarmas bowl in half and eat as two meals.. their portion is pretty big.. check it out!!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from this location multiple times. This is the place we've found where the beef kabobs taste the closest to homemade (but of course nothing compares to grandpa's kabobs). The meat is tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. And they have some bread under the kabobs that soaks up the juice and is so tasty. Their hummus is delicious and garlicky and creamy. If you don't like garlic, then you won't like this hummus. They bring the perfect amount of tomatoes, rice and salad to go with the kabobs and they make sure there is plenty of butter for the rice and sumac packets and a lot of pita bread. We've always been satisfied with the service and food. This is our go to Persian dinner when we don't feel like cooking it ourselves."}
{"text":"Customer Service and food are always great.  My family likes this place a lot.  I absolutely recommend this Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place and a great food! Very delicious.  Place is clean and the food is healthy. We like to eat healthy food and I am glad we found this place ."}
{"text":"My new favorite midday stop. Very tasty and fast. Lunch is busy ,but 2pm is my schedule for lunch. Gyro is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch here 2 days in a row for delivery. Not a long wait, food was fresh, hot and delicious. I would recommend the ground chicken kabob and hummus. Came with a side salad, bbq'd veggies and saffron rice. Happy with the portion size. Wish the had a frequent buyer reward/stamp card. Happy overall. Thank you"}
{"text":"5/5 - here's why:   1) value for money. We ordered two salads, each with a side of meat and a dolmah. Hummus was free because the order was over $10. The total came out to under $15.   2) quality of food - the salads were fresh and the portion size was generous. Meat was some of the best gyro meat I've had. Meat dolmah Gad a rest curry flavoring.   3) service - this place was quick. The owner/manager was attentive, our food was pleasing to look at and taste. He even gave us some tangy, thick middle eastern yogurt on the house. It was delicious. Well decorated and clean.   I definitely recommend this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with the quality of the food here but more so with the service. I love Mediterranean food and was so excited that a location opened so close to where I work. I ordered take out twice and dined in once. The takeout was mediocre food but good overall experience. The dine in was horrible on top of horrible!!! They were understaffed, way understaffed. I didn't care and I decided to stay and order anyway. meat was rare, I asked for well done, the taboulli salad had no dressing and i asked for bread too many times to recall and received none. Waste of time and money. I just left."}
{"text":"This place just opened by my office & after seeing their menu & pricing I wanted to check it out. Called in a lunch order midday today & the guy who took my order repeated back, got my name & said it would be ready in 10 minutes. Sure enough, 10 minutes later I got there & they were just bagging my food. Very friendly & accommodating staff. I asked for some extra pita & they helped me right away.   I got back to my office where a co-worker and myself were sharing the Vegetable Kabob plate ($8.95) & the Mazza Plate ($7.50) since it's \"meatless Monday's.\" Both of us were surprised by how much food we got & how tasty everything was. The tabouli was honestly so good, and I love tabouli so coming from me that means a lot! My only complaint is that the vegetables were a little salty and the salad had no dressing.   This place is a great lunch time deal, two of us ate for under $20 and still had leftovers. I love that I was able to get in & out quickly & efficiently. I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Went here to order some dinner for me and my wife..   walking in.. its a simple setup.. nothing to fancy.. the decor was ok.. they have tables and chairs and also a high table if you want to stand and eat i guess...  when i went.. it wasnt busy at all.. the staff seemed to be new since one guy was instructing 2/3 others how to set up the food..   i will ding them a star only because the price was a little bit much compared to other Mediterranean spots... but the food quality and taste does make up for the prices...  a bit slower on the delivery.. again.. because one guy was teaching the others how to put together my meal.. i didnt mind it though.. just a tip.. might be frustrating for those in a hurry..   probably wont come back only because of the price difference.. other than that.. good luck !"}
{"text":"I was glad to see there is a new location near my home.  I love the food here! Never fails, always delicious always fresh, not to mention great service Totally craving now!!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not sure if we had a bad experience here but maybe we did and I have no desire to go back, esp with so many other great fast casual Mediterranean places like Parsley or Meraki nearby.    The restaurant is really small, a little crowded and certainly crammed in behind the counter where their grill and salad station and registers are. The grill is so small it can maybe cook 3 items. So when it got busy, the wait seemed to be long and perhaps they were understaffed.   We waited a long time for our two items. I had a salmon salad which was tomatoes and cucumber and salmon. The salmon was totally over cooked and tasted like tuna. I thought it should have more in it, like garbanzo beans or feta or something that would make it more exciting than what I could throw together at home. The salad also came dry, they have bottles of vinaigrette on every table (with the IKEA stickers still on them). My husband had the Mediterranean burger which was cooked well and tasty.   For $25, it seemed like a waste of money and definitely not satisfying."}
{"text":"I am very amaze with this new location, very clean, food was delicious. Staff recognize you the moment you walk in, very kind people.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, and they give you big portions!! Great quality meats and the hummus is so so good. So glad they opened another location. It is a must try!"}
{"text":"First time at the new location! Came in right before the dinner rush and was very satisfied. Fresh, flavorful and so very filling. I had the gyro sandwich, fries and a coke all for $10. Glad I was able to eat enough and save the rest for later :) I will definitely be back soon. Thank you Shahin for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Great place! Large portion! Great food! It is the best greek food restaurant in Town."}
