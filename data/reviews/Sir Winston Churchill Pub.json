{"text":"Best place after work! Awesome 2 for 1 between 5pm and 8pm with free homemade crisps!"}
{"text":"We had a lunch here. Nice music, not too many people but I can imagine this place at night full of people and loud music. We ordered Niçoise salad and duck and lentils. It was delicious. Indeed delicious - I would not expect pub to have so tasty food :-). The beer was good also. Place is highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking awesome! 2 for 1 beers during happy hour count me in. The food was incredible! And the waiter top notch!"}
{"text":"Good times here. Waitress were very nice. Popcorn was a great late night snack. Good band. Cider on tap was light and crisp. Great for people watching."}
{"text":"Sangria was excellent! The patio was so awesome. Such great people watching. We really enjoyed sitting watching the people pass by. We had nachos and carrot soup. Both were excellent. The best thing was happy hour! Look or ask about the happy hour prices. Be sure you understand them as you might end up with 3 drinks!"}
{"text":"Went there on a sunday night, not crowded but the service was still sub-par. Drinks were okay. Nothing special. About the same price as anywhere else. However, there is an obligatory 15% gratuity for just two people. We were using US dollars and they did not exchange it properly, ended up paying a fair amount more than we should have."}
{"text":"I can't comment on their food or nightlife but I was here on a Saturday afternoon to take in a few beers and people watch.
I can see how it might get rowdy at night since people were well on their way during the early afternoon. 
Our waitress didn't push food on us and was attentive with our drinks.
I would say that cresent street is pretty much a tourist trap but if you are a tourist like me and staying near St Cathrine street then I can tell you that there isn't much else going on specifically at night that is walking distance."}
{"text":"we went for the football, plain & simple. not a lot of options around if you want (need) to watch an NFL game. the place was HUGE & pretty empty on a sunday afternoon. bartenders were real nice, food looked decent. if you're looking for friendly, casual spot to watch your team... this is it."}
{"text":"very rude staff! The girls that work here are very pushy about tipping, they will call you out if you don't tip them what THEY think they deserve. I am not from Montreal and realize that bartenders rely on their tips, however a tip should never be expected it should be earned. Our bartender hardly new what any of the drinks we wanted were, she was slow, and on top of that she was checking her phone and gossiping with co-workers on the floor which I found extremely unprofessional considering there were customers at the bar constantly trying to catch someones attention.
Id never go bak."}
{"text":"There are 3 levels in this place, one level is a dance floor. I went on a Wed night, it's totally empty at around 10. Drinks r pricy and small. From the name, the place sounds serious and it does look so - wooden interrier. There was live music when I was there and big screen TVs showing hocky. 

It's not my taste but it is a landmark - the first bar on Cresent!"}
{"text":"I heard good things but was kind of let down.  They had great drink specials for happy hour on a Friday (2 for 1) but the free buffet was not very enticing.  Just some small pieces of pizza and some chips and popcorn.

The bartenders are really friendly and they played cool 70's funk tunes.  

The downstairs got a decent crowd as the night went on.  Not great music though.  

Better spaces on Crescent to hit up."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the drinks here. Sitting outside on the patio was nice. You have a view of Crescent Street which is very busy. The white sangria was delicious and the cocktails were well-made."}
{"text":"Atmosphere

So this is the place me and my friends would go after classes considering its proximity to Concordia University. We were not picky and we were attracted to the different promos going on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It has three floors, the basement which is considered a club (in all honesty, they shouldn't), the second floor is a nice bar with a live band (usually) and the third floor is Karinas (always empty but a good spot to rent for private events). Needless to say that the spot I usually go to is on the second floor: they don't have a cover on weekends and they have a much better terrace than the basement. The band I usually get when I go is pretty good and the feeling of the place is very casual. It has the same feeling as a McGibbons or an Irish Pub. Winston Churchil gets a 3 stars for the atmosphere. 

Drinks & Food

I am not a big fan of the drinks served at Winston Churchill. Besides their Sangria, every drink that is not a beer was poorly done. The only positive point that Winston Churchill has over other bars is that it is cheaper. On Tuesdays they have a special which is $2.50 for the drink and $4 the beer, which in my opinion, is a great deal. The food aspect of this place is as you would expect bar food to be (typical nachos and fries) however what is interesting with this place is that the food is not the same from one floor to another (probably because the vibe of the floors are different: the basement being a ''club'' and the second floor being a bar with a pub feel to it). This Montreal bar gets a 2 stars for its drinks.

Service

The service on the terrace is usually really bad, with the exception of one or two good waitresses. I don't think I have ever got so much attitude coming from a waitress before. However, if you decide to stay inside on the basement level, I would go ask for a bartender called Valerie. She is very nice and talkative and will make sure you have a good night. The service of this Montreal bar gets 2 stars.  

Location

The location of Winston Churchill is particularly good during the summer considering it is located on Crescent street (it's awesome during the Grand Prix weekend) and awesome for when you go to school downtown. Its proximity to metro Guy Concordia makes it really easy to access as well. For all these reasons, Winston Churchill gets 4 stars for its location.

The total amount of stars I would allocate to Winston Churchill in general would be 3."}
{"text":"Food decent but overpriced.
Sangria ridiculously overpriced.
Service extremely slow.
Staff claimed billing system was down and made handrawn bill.  Over charged for items and added wrong (Charged $54 for $42 worth).
I addressed the waitress on her errors and she promptly disappeared for 15-20 minutes. Returned and said there was no manager on duty."}
{"text":"Oh the things I have seen here. A lovely combination of disgusting and endless comic relief. If you go in only with the expectation of seeing a sh*t show, you will not be disappointed.

The locals know this as a tourist spot, but will come on occasion (likely to prey on young, drunk Americans).

To re-iterate a commonly used word in other reviews: sloppy."}
{"text":"Pour moi le churchill est l'endroit idéal pour un happy hour simple et pas cher (et 5 à 8 svp). Au diable, les bars upper, sophistiqués, les cocktails à 15$.... Des fois les endroits les plus simples sont les meilleurs! J'adore ce bar pour leur 5h à 8h avec 2 bières pour une, 2 verres de vin à 10$ etc...le GROS plus, le mini buffet gratuit (chips maison, tortilla, petites saucisses, et d'autres selon les jours). Ils font aussi restaurant, et leurs plats sont plutôt bons, tout ce que j'ai pu manger là bas a toujours était bien cuisiné. Le service est bon en général, certains serveurs/serveuses sont vraiment plus sympas que d'autres! 
Si vous cherchez un endroit calme et romantique ce n'est pas le mieux, mais entre amis c'est l'endroit parfait!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was horrible. Was served an expired beer (2 months past date) and server didn't bother to ask if I'd like something else when I sent it back. 
Nice patio, but would never come back."}
{"text":"I really love this place! It has a huge dance floor, great looking people and it's in Montreal. I also love its patio overlooking Rue Crescent. Drinks are priced right, food is great, I really never had anything to complain about and been there 3 times.
Oh, wait there's no parking! Well, it's downtown Montreal, and customers should never expect to find free parking in any big city. Parkings are available in nearby lots and range between $10 and $15 Canadian.
You should definitely check it out next time in Montreal"}
{"text":"Winston's is fun! I had a great time there! So much so, I left my keys there when they fell out of my purse.

I just wanted to say, Renee made sure I got them back. I'm from out of town and by the time everything got organized, I was home. She Fed Ex'ed me my keys for me. I can not tell you what a relief that was. She made sure my stupid ass was in the know the whole time (she emailed me to let me know the day and time she dropped them in the mail). Wow. She didn't need to do that. She could have said she didn't find them. But she went the extra mile.

I will be returning to Winston's and requesting to sit in Renee's section!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of the front desk girl at our hotel. We are a couple of gals in our mid-20s and were looking to have some fun at a bar or lounge. 

There was no cover just a $2 coat check fee, which wasn't so bad. Grabbed a couple of seats by the downstairs bar and ordered a couple of shots followed by a round of mixed drinks. Thought it was interesting that the shots are poured so precisely from a machine, but thought nothing of it. Realized that made for a very weak mixed drink. The bartender was extra sweet so we chatted with her thensat back and enjoyed the music. There was Top 40s music playing. Very good mix. 

After a while the place started getting crowded, but everyone seemed so young! I mean I know the drinking age here is 18 but I swear there were some preteens sitting next to us. Lol. 

The preteens swarmed the dance floor and we decided to check out the upstairs. Talk about night and day! Upstairs was a much older crowd listening to a live band play music that couldn't have been made after 1980. It was a good vibe up there, older couples dancing, people lounging. But again not what we were looking for.

We felt too old for downstairs and too young for upstairs so we left."}
{"text":"Average menu, average customer service. The wings were really crispy and delicious though
Enjoyed a 2-hour get away with friends 
The bill was acceptable not high at all for two drinks and a dish"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of reading other reviews of this place just now...so will try to not let them bias my own, although people are making good points about this place.

While visiting Montreal for a long weekend, four of us were walking around in the touristy restaurant area off St. Catherine and decided to check this place out because of its huge two-level patio along the street.  It was a nice day, not too warm, but bearable to sit outside, probably around 2:30 in the afternoon?

The place was empty inside, but apparently fills up at night with the young drinking crowd, as any pub should.  GIANT inside - I think I counted seven actual bars.  But we sat on the patio, getting one of the last few empty tables.  

Took a few minutes to be acknowledged, but the waitress was quite friendly when she did come over.  Broken English, but spoke it well enough.  After giving us our menus, a few minutes later another young guy came over to take our drink order.  The waitress then came back and was surprised to find out the guy had served us.  No biggie.

$3.50 pints of beer!  I believe we only had the choice between Keith's and Molson X, but for that price, who cares, worth it.  

Typical pub menu.  Only had two actual vegetarian options on the menu, but I've not had much luck with veggie burgers lately, so didn't feel like trying that.  The other option, I cannot recall.  So I got an order of homemade fries and an order of onion rings.  (oh so healthy, lol).  They were fine, served in cute, little metal buckets.  Another in my party ordered what she thought were the mozza sticks, but maybe the wording she used, or the broken English of the server, resulted in her getting jalapeno poppers instead, which were average.  Another ordered their classic club & fries ($12.50) which looked and tasted fine.  We didn't go here thinking the food would be spectacular, and it wasn't.  But we had no problems with any of it.  My experience is that pubs are 90% of the time, average at best, with the odd rarity standing out for deliciousness.

Would I go back?  Sure, but probably only for drinks.  If hungry, I'd try one of the other hundred restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Watered down drinks and ridiculous cover charge for men. Went on a Friday night at 11:30 and it wasn't even full inside. Not worth the trip or the price"}
{"text":"Popular, packed place with good happy hour deals and decent food. The service can get slow because there are so many people. It's in an ideal location on Crescent Street (don't try to park) and though the tables are very close to one another on the patio, the inside looks very spacious."}
{"text":"A multi-floored pub on the popular crescent street, it was hard to figure out what kind of bar this was. I believe they had a local band play during the night and then a DJ on one of the other floors. We came in during the day for happy hour and sat on the upstairs deck which has a nice view. Drinks are a little bit more expensive in this bar than some others on the street but the atmosphere was good and service was excellent too. Would like to check it out during a weekend night to see how it is."}
{"text":"This place is a good tourist spot. You get to meet different people from different places in the world. They have a good live band in the upstairs level. The pub is actually pretty big inside there is multiple bar area to sit, eat, and drink. The downstair level is usually a little less crowded then upstairs and a little more relax. The staff was friendly and good to chat with."}
{"text":"The food is terrible the cheese sticks came with ketchup my crab stuffed avocado was mostly onions and not enough crab my friends chicken wings weren't chicken wings they were chick wings. Plus our waitress tried telling it wasnt ketchup and when she realized she was wrong she didnt even apologize or offered marinara.The one and only star I give them is for the hockey game and the beautiful people."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. There are three levels to it, each one with its own feel. The people who work there are all very nice and the food/drinks are very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy SIr Winston for a 5-7 after work. The fact its centrally located in the heart of downtown on Crescent with a beautiful two floor terrasse is a quick go to on my list. Good for groups or a solo study date . Never really required reservations for this place, the terrasse does fill up quite fast. On this particular evening, I went at around 5 pm- their happy hour specials were going on until 8 pm- on house wines and beers.  I ordered a pint of shock top that I enjoyed as a summer ale- and a plate of nachos (extra for chicken and guac)- that was pretty dry but filling enough to not want to eat dinner!"}
{"text":"Definitely Meh - I've had better. 

Overall a good generic pub - good live music, good pub food, bad and inflexible waitress/computer system.

While we were there there was a live band that played class rock style music. they were good for a bar band. The nachos we shared were really good stand up bar food. My friend said hs wings were good, not great. The most annoying thing was that the kitchen closed at 10pm and they didn't warn us it was closing. We had ordered the nachos but were still hungary so we were going to split more with the group but couldn't order any more (I think it was like 10:08pm, so annoying. Also we oder some shots and pints which were fine but we wanted to order polar bear shots. They're usually half creme de menthe (mint liquor) and half creme de cacao (chocolate liquor). Super yummy and tastes like a york peppermint patty. They didn't have them on their shots list but we just told the waitress what it was but she couldn't make it for us because there wasn't a code for it in their computer system and they couldn't dispense shots without the computer system because it tracked the liquor use.  So annoying. We asked can't you just charge us for 2 shots of creme de cacao and 2 shots of creme de menthe but put them together in a shaker and then pour it out into 4 shot glasses? But the waitress wouldn't. Not the best service. 

Later (I think midnight) the downstairs lounge/bar area turns into a bit of a club with pounding dance music but it wasn't that great. There wasn't enough dance space/room and the music was pretty crappy. 

Basically it wasn't the worst ever but it certainly wasn't anything above or beyond. I wouldn't rush to go back again anytime soon but I woulnd't refuse to return."}
{"text":"Maybe if i was in my early 20s I would appreciate this place more. But alas, I'm an older chap, so the vibe here just isn't my speed. There was an intimidating bouncer vibe at the door getting in, we were asked to take off our hats and coats, and the drinks were below average. I guess the people watching was okay, but otherwise, show me a dive bar with a jukebox and I'm happy."}
{"text":"Great music, great ambience, friendly crowd, cheap drinks. What more can you ask for? Free cover for females (unforunately not for the males). You have the choice to eat food outside, socialize on the side, or join the dance floor. They had a large variety of music played - edm, hip hop, rnb, pop, reggaeton, reggae - and a great taste as well. The place is very large but it does get very crowded. I never ended up finding a coat check so I can't tell you much about that. Definitely a great place if you are going with a group who has different tastes in music. Coming back again for sure when it is not raining!!!"}
{"text":"Went out to Montreal for a friend's bday, came to this bar and was blown away by the bartender, Alana, i hope i spelled it correct. Awesome awesome awesome bartender! Will definitely come back next time for her! We had a situation with the tips with her, felt bad about it but definitely made it up to her the next night! Also the bacon cheeseburger was on point, my friend and i enjoyed ourselves at this bar!"}
{"text":"Being on one of the most tourist-trap streets of Montreal, you can expect some hustle and bustle, you can also expect a rushy type of service once in a while, or the occasional waitress who will be pushy about her tips. 

However, I only come to Sir Winston Churchill's for two things, and two things only. 

ONE - To sit on their terrasse and people (or tourist) watch along Crescent street.
TWO - For their 5-8 happy hour (unlike most that are 5-7).

They have great specials on beer and house wine, they even have a few tables in the back that serve free popcorn, pizza, sandwiches, chips, and veggies with dip. If you want actual food, then I'd recommend the wings (one of the best I have tried in Montreal), or their burger. The pub is also great for watching sports, as they have a few TV's dispersed inside.

All in all, it's not such a bad place, it has got its perks and can be fun, but don't expect anything stellar."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my visit! We went there during happy hour after a long hike through Mont Royal. The happy hour is until 7pm. Buy One Get One Free. 

The bar was extremely spacious and had 2 levels. We hung out on the second floor. My favorite part was the free food they offer during happy hour. Numerous options to choose from and it was actually pretty good! Plus they have slot machines and good music. I'd definitely recommend for a fun evening out! :)"}
{"text":"Fun place. Big beer servings and decent bar food. Great patio seating. The food is OK, acceptable bar food. Plenty of TVs inside to watch sports. Nice bartenders/photographers."}
{"text":"Not sure we went to the pub. i'm pretty sure we were directed to the Club part of this establishment. 
There was a mix of tourists, hoochie girls, really sloppy and drunk frat boys. 
Not horrible but not really my scene. The bartenders were nice though"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the waitresses were a sight for sore eyes, and the selection of booze is excellent. Oh, and the chocolate cake was magnifique."}
{"text":"Comme sur Crescent..une vrai attrape touriste...Le menu est correct..mais bon pas particuliairement attrayant. En attendant une table, j'ai été au bar et j'ai commandé une pinte pendant un 5@7..la barmaid ne m'avais jamais informé de ses spéciaux qui étaient tout de même bon...2 pour 1 pour les bouteilles de bière .. Il y avait une game de hochey mais pas de son..Bref je ne crois pas y retourner..à moins d'y aller pour rencontrer des touristes.."}
{"text":"Great pub right smack in the heart of the city.

I really like how it's devided. The lounge area, really dark and full of cozy seats. The bar, real \"seriously English pub\" and the terrasse with all that happy summer MTL vibe.

The price are OK. Not great, but if you like Guinness on tap, you know that pint is never cheap."}
{"text":"Not exactly a chic hangout, but does it's job with cheap drinks, and heated outdoor seating so you can enjoy the views of bustling Crescent St.  I was there on a weeknight, and several  small groups filled the lookout, but the place was so spacious that we were able to have our privacy.  

Service was a little spotty as it took 3 of us to flag down a waitress when it wasn't even busy.  It's a great meeting place to start the night with a drink or two, but I don't recommend staying."}
{"text":"I've been here more than enough times to give them a 3 the place is packed with creeps that don't leave you alone.

Drinks are nothing special food isn't anything I would come back for. I had a bite of a wing and that was that.

Try to avoid the dance floor unless you like being grabbed and grinding on so take the long way to the bathroom.

Service is meh unless you have Victoria b.

Don't plan on ever returning after st Patrick's day lol"}
{"text":"It was late and this was the only place serving food on Crescent. Decided to sit on the upstairs patio. The fish and chips were more like terrible and soggy. Seems to be a popular place for some odd reason. Saw a lot of tourists and local men who have found a random American girl who is enthralled by the honhonhonhon accent."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night for my friend's bachelorette party. It was also the big McGregor/Mayweather fight night, so the place was packed! Thankfully we got there right before most people and got in right away. Free for ladies, 5$ for guys. 

The first floor was already dancing and the music too loud to chat, so we went outside on the terrasse. We had two sangria pitchers and two rounds of blow job (the shooter lol). So much fun!! The drinks were fine, and it wasn't too busy on the terrasse so the waitress was fairly fast and attentive. They played remixes of hits after hits and people seemed to love it. I wished we could have stayed longer to check out the dance floor, but we left around 1AM. A lot of people also left around that time, since that's when the fight ended.

I had a great time :)"}
{"text":"Bouncers are rude, place is sketchy, overall terrible service. There are plenty of other options in the area, so stay away from this place."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back. Great food,  great service equals BEST PUB Ever!"}
{"text":"Okay so this place I have only visited during the day time, thus far. I was amazed at how many terraces this place had. Idyllic street with a seat overlooking the European style architecture? This is worth a stop. 

This was my first exposure to poutine, and I was not disappointed. I tried a bite of the wifes burger, she got hers plain with cheese (sorry she's a picky eater). The burger was tender and delicious, and was not dripping with grease. The drink selection was good, the staff I found attentive and pleasant. The space is a little cramped, but I also take up more than my fair share of space so I won't knock them for it. Went here on a friend's recommendation, and I would do the same to you."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Montreal for the first time, and we ate dinner here tonight. We had walked down Rue Crescent earlier in the day and it looked like it would be a busy place at night. We were right. The street was packed. Mostly younger people, out for a friday night. We went to Churchill's, and the inside was EMPTY. We also wanted to eat ouside, so we asked for a table. We were warned that it was crowded, but we were fine with it. As someone mentioned below, you have barely an inch between tables. You may as well just hug the person as you sit down, because you're gonna wind up touching more of them. I got my usual, caesar salad with grilled chicken and my friend got the steak and brie on a baguette. We also got an order of the poutine (neither of us had tried it). Food was meh. Poutine wasn't as gross as I thought it'd be ... Our waitress was very friendly. We just weren't that impressed with it. The atmosphere was fun, but the drinks were expensive for us.

Great place if you're a college student, or out to get drunk and party, and want decent but not superb food."}
{"text":"This is going to be a very mixed review because I have very mixed feelings about Sir Winston Churchill pub. First of all love their food, best fish and chips, hot wings, pizza, steak, burgers, their food is always fresh and prepared very well. Service depends greatly on who your server is, Gregory is the very best delivering your food and beverages with lots of wit and charm, but the downside is he doesn't get many hours so it's a long shot that he will be your server. Many of the other servers leave you sitting with empty glasses for lengthy times... not fun. Then there is the band where they get their Playlist Idk but I usually hear about 3 songs and leave and I see others do the same. They have absolutely no interaction with the patrons like how is everyone tonight? or what music would you like to hear? I get a feeling they find their job extremely boring. I am only able to go on Saturday but I would love to hear another band at Winnies. I really wanted to give a better review but the past 3 months or so of experiences there have left me feeling generous leaving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good Bar in Canadia. It got quite busy after 10 and the ruckus was as usual chaotic and out of control. In fact this place got sloppy fast I even saw a midget fighting a french lady. Where are the bouncers? And why am I still waiting on that G&T. WTF.... 3 stars for chaos only. If you just want to drink I think you need to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years.  It was actually one of the first bars I ever went to.

Seems like a MTL institution.  Sort of pubby / restaurant during the day, then the BASSment (play on words, yes), turns into a full blown club with VIP booths, a dancefloor, with expensive covers and coat-check.  So so place to hang out.  Low ceilings, and, you definitely know you're in a basement.

Overall, go check this place out if you're walking by and on Crescent Street.  

Never eaten there, but sure have put back a lot of drinks there.  The first time I went (I'm an out of towner) was 20 years ago.

Thanks for the memories SWC."}
{"text":"Ah, to be in le Rue Crescent on game night.  Pretty much a solid bar to be for in a hockey game (even though I could care less about the local Habs-- GO BLACKHAWKS!), the tri-level bar, friendly waitresses with red miniskirts that'd make a Hooters girl blush and a dance floor for post drink number twenty.  You have to order food separately than drinks which is a bit of a pain but the new menu has pig knuckles so minus one plus one.  Whoever below said they have strong drinks must be a Canadian; this is sadly a country of strictly metered pours."}
{"text":"This is a hard rating for me - as an establishment I had no issue with service, the drinks I ordered were strong, it was dead on a Monday night but packed on a tuesday, on the Monday the bar man was actually nice enough to give us good recommendations of where would actually be busy. 

I was dragged back Tuesday, at 2am I was sober and ready for bed, but with a friend who insisted on dancing. Fine, I go. She goes on the dance floor, I sit at the edge of it. I find out it's so packed because drinks are $2.50. Insanely drunk men then proceed to assume me sitting along at the side of the dance floor playing on my mobile phone means \"you should really come and drunkenly hit on me.\" Obviously they haven't heard of serve it right here. One drunk patron yelled at me when I declined an offer of a drink. No bar staff to be seen for me to complain to. So I left.

I think this place would be really fun on a less busy night, or if you are counting on being one of the people who has over consumed."}
{"text":"If you're like me you'll want to go upstairs on weekend nights.  That's where the band is playing.  If you're not like me, you can go downstairs to where the DJ plays and is a significantly younger crowd gathers.  Although you can hear the booming coming through the floor every time the band stops playing, and sometimes even when the band is playing!

Food is decent, particularly for a pub.  Service is good there and the beer is cold!  There are plenty of TVs to watch a game if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Actually, the only reason I'm giving here three stars is because the sitting patio was incredibly busy and I felt like we're sitting literally on top of each other. You had to be careful not to touch by accident (which was all the time) your next table, which had a inch distance. :D

We ordered beer and club sandwiches with nice fries. And the beer and the sandwich were pretty good. We didn't have to wait for long time to sit and the girl who helped us was pretty nice and helpful. 

This place is typical spot for college students. The day we went there you would mostly notice youthful crowd. That's why the sitting system didn't bother anyone. Not bad for a weekday dinner place for some fun action around."}
{"text":"This was the best bar in Montreael that I've been to. Drinks are very pricey but it's a \"tourist trap\" I guess LoL  Pretty good music."}
{"text":"i came here a couple times during my stay in montreal.. beers are relatively cheap by the pitcher.. and if you can get a seat upstairs.. it's great for people watching.."}
{"text":"Sir Winston Churchill's is a fun place to go to in the Restaurant Row of Montreal. Not only is there a club below the bar, but the bar has three full sized bars! Great beers here, loved the selections. I recommend for a good place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"Don't like it.  Annoying doormen won't let you in unless they like what you're wearing, meanwhile it's 90% guys and the music is loud and terrible.  Drinks aren't cheap either.  Crap atmosphere for Crescent St.

It's fine in the day when it isn't a nightclub though, 2nd floor patio is nice enough."}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch outside on the balcony on a perfect September afternoon. We were worn out by a long but enjoyable visit to the Museum of Fine Arts and were happy to sit down in the sunshine and look out on the street and sip a glass of white wine.   The lunch specials were very good. I had a cup of soup and a very nice duck confit for about $15."}
{"text":"So, everyone has different reviews for different experiences. My friend and I were visiting Montreal and we stopped in for a drink and the infamous, poutine. The bartender was lovely; super friendly and really accommodating to all of our touristy questions. The poutine was delicious, my beer was cheap. We sat downstairs. This place is HUGE. Our hotel wasn't too far from it, so we got to peek at what it is like at night and eh...I could understand some of the reviews. I'd recommend happy hour or lunch, but maybe not so much that night scene."}
{"text":"Could be a fun touristy place but it's a disaster. The \"bar\" has a serious identity crisis. Is it a pub, a club or something else. They have really overpriced bottle service which is some of the worst I've ever seen. The staff is marginal to rude, on a good day. They also have this silly coat check racket with only a couple people working on a weekend night. You wait 20min to drop off your coat, pay $2 CAD and then wait 30min to pick it up. I'm no bar owner but I think customers would be better off in the bar buying drinks, not playing some coat check game for $2. STAY AWAY, rip off"}
{"text":"Serves the average bar food with nice portions and good quality.  Great place for a casual bite and a drink."}
{"text":"Came from the US for a bachelor party.  They force a coat check for  $2 in the lower club level which is fine. However, trying to leave at 1 am to retrieve coat it took over half an hour in line. Terribly frustrating and a dumb business model."}
{"text":"My friend ordered a glass of baileys with milk. Taste good. I ordered a French onion soup and cheese plate. They are both delicious. The cheeses are from Quebec. The bread was tender. I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I didn't get food, but I drank here a couple nights when I was in Montreal in May. Service is fast and friendly, and the place attracts a fun group of people. It's not expensive, and its close to the Lowe's and Sofitel where my friends and I were staying. There are much better bars on Rue Sainte Catherine, but if you want a cool place to chill this works."}
{"text":"Je n'aime pas l'ambiance de  ce bar dansant , car on se sent  entassés quand on danse  et  le service à la clientèle est mauvais .La  musique est   bien  mais  les  gens  sur  piste  de  dance    sont  beaucoup  trop  agressif    quand  nous  sommes   des   femmes   . Je n'y retournerais   plus pour ces raisons  ."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here pretty much every night while visiting on spring break, and it never got old.  The music was great, there was a lot of dancing, good drinks, great crowds.  I'd definitely return if I was in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Let me say this first that I've never been here except for an event so my review reflects what I observed during the event that took place at Sir Winston Churchill Pub.

There was a mobile cellphone event (CrackBerry) that was taking place and they decided to hold it at Sir Winston Churchill Pub. As mentioned, I've never been here before but since I wanted to go to the event and it was close by to where I work, I went there.

The event included a drink and food. The food was typical pub food and I had a bottled beer so I can't really say much about it. The place has free WiFi but seemed to require signing in with an e-mail address or Facebook (I forget which one). I didn't use it since my cellphone had data and I had more than enough data to worry about exceeding my monthly amount.

I didn't have any issues with the included/served pub food and found it to be good. It wasn't too crowded on the day of the event (it was a Monday evening) and we had part of the pub to ourselves. I found the seating to be good. They not only had places to sit at the bar but also regular chairs at the tables as well as \"couch-type\" seats in certain area as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed going to the Sir Winston Churchill Pub mainly for the happy hour drink specials. You can't beat them."}
{"text":"Le Churchill, un de mes endroits favoris à Montréal! On peut à la fois y boire un verre, posé, entre amis tout en écoutant un bon band et si on a un ptit creux, pas de soucis, on peut  y savourer un ptit plat! On a le choix entre des plats plutôt gras mais biens bons mais aussi des plats un peu plus raffinés et tout aussi bons, de quoi satisfaire tout le monde.

Par après, quoi de mieux que de se défouler un peu et enflammer le dance floor tout au long de la nuit! 

De plus, ce qui est vraiment top c'est leur 5 à 8, les bières et cocktails (de base) sont moins chers, le verre de vin plus un offert, pour 5$. Ce qui fait que l' on se retrouve souvent avec beaucoup plus de verres qu'il n y a de personnes à la table. 

Tout cela accompagné d'une bonne ambiance, un chouette décor, des gens sympas,  un bon service et d'un bon rapport qualité/prix. 

C'est un endroit que je vous conseille! Vous ne serez pas déçus!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, this might be one of the best Happy Hours on Crescent. 2 for 1 on bar rail and most bottled beers, cheaper pints, and the staff here are awesome! Every day from 5-8 including weekends so this place's terrace is always full during the warmer months. The food is surprisingly good and their happy hour specials come with a self serve snack bar on the 2nd floor."}
{"text":"Best bar/terrace/resto on rue Crescent...I shit you not.

The terrace is ALWAYS packed. Its dope for people-watching. 

Uhhhhh...the kidney pie is fuckin just like the ones I had in London.  Sick ish.

The hottie waitresses are hella chill and quick."}
{"text":"Friendly staff...young crowd...everybody seems to be desperate to get laid....the underground area is pretty boring....there is a \"dance floor\" where nobody dances, it lacks ambiance, no mirror ball, no lights, no laser beams...if you want people to dance and have a good time spend a bit of money and create some ambiance."}
{"text":"Super chill during happy hour, a little raucous at night.

Loved the comfy, red velvety vibe of the upstairs part of the bar. At happy hour, the service was divine, some good 2 for 1 beer specials, and a free hot-plate buffet (the mushroom pizza slices makes for unbelievably great appetizers when guzzling beer.) Also, they had the best selection of glassware of any bar I've ever seen. That might not seem like a meaningful point to most, but I think there's great value to getting the right glass with the right drink. My party of three all ordered different kinds of beer and each was served in a different glass. superb!

At night, the mood changes, as the downstairs turns into a dance club, so the upstairs totally SUFFERS from the obnoxious bass-booming that emanates from down below... try having a conversation between the bass below and the hockey game on the tv above, and it begins to get either irritating or comical... so bring your sense of humor after 9pm."}
{"text":"Great place to go out dacing, the staff is nice, it's a three floors restaurant bar, prices are a little bit high."}
{"text":"This place is sloppy and out of control. Only head here if you want an outrageous night. I know the locals make fun of this place, but if you're with a big group you can manage to have a lot of fun.

The guys are skeevy and the girls dress slutty, but you can make the best of it. The drinks are a little price-y, but there are multiple floors. I think the covers can be steep on weekend nights but it's open really late and there's fun music.

One of the other reviewers mentioned coming here lots during a spring break trip, and that's exactly what this place is meant for. Defeinitely not your average night or even every Saturday."}
{"text":"Great pub!! I'm from the states but every time I've been to montreal I've insisted we come back here! Love how each level is its own vibe. Great bartenders too"}
{"text":"I just want to know who hires a DJ that plays slow Ed Sheeran music on a Saturday night. At a club. It wasn't even a remix?!
Also their drinks aren't the greatest (exception being the cosmos which will get you very tipsy very fast) but it's pretty chill if you want a day time drink with nachos on a nice day. Apart from that they don't really card soooooooo yeah you will probably see a lot of CEGEP kiddos excited to be in a club."}
{"text":"Two fond memories from this tourist trap: 
1) Being threatened by the waitress that we were not drinking fast enough and that unless we reordered more drinks, she would ask us to leave as we were monopolizing a table (Note: Half the place was empty)
2) A different time, being rudely asked by the waitress to give more tips as 15% for poor service wasnt enough.

The only reason this place exists is because of its tourist trap location and constant influx of new students who go there every year to get wasted. AVOID"}
{"text":"Nice place although the music is pretty loud!! Girls that come are  smoking hot!! Could be considered as a meat market or a banquet!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE WORST. Customer service is horrid, they lost my friends coat I was appalled. The guys were so creepy constantly trying to take advantage of girls. Bouncers are super aggressive and rude. Overall terrible experience and I would definitely not go back EVER"}
{"text":"Yes, I am writing a review while traveling. Some things are just worth talking about as soon as you can so you can move on. That's pretty much the case for this place so here I am. We stopped mid-day on the Thursday before the Canadian GP to have a beer and soak up the street party/festival outside. They had open tables, had poutine on the menu and it seemed like prices would be comparatively decent. $19 for a pitcher of good beer wasn't bad, but everything else was pretty much crap. With it's marginal bar food and wet floors, it's obviously a place where people (who aren't us) party into the wee hours, spill drinks on each other and swap communicable diseases. Definitely not my thing."}
{"text":"If your in Montreal for a bachelor party and wondering what bar to go to in downtown look no further. We setup shop here last Friday and got table service right near the dance floor and had an absolute blast. Great music, great dancing and great crowd.  So those of you planning a bachelor party look no further."}
{"text":"Ça va comme endroit, pas le meilleur sur Montréal mais bon, les prix sont abordables, que ça soit pour un verre ou pour grignoter un petit plat. La seule chose que j'ai trouvé un peu abusée c'était la serveuse qui nous a demandé plus que 10 fois si tout va bien. Oui c'est gentil mais quand c'est répété chaque 5 minutes, ça devient un peu trop :/ mais sinon le reste est pas mal pour une soirée entre amies"}
{"text":"Legendary place...
Everything is average... But it was one of the first clubs I sneaked in to when I was a teen. So I can't complain lol."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal late on a Friday night and strolled from our hotel in search of a place with an open kitchen. This pub was thumping with a live band and raucous crowd. We were immediately seated outside on the upstairs patio with a great view overlooking the street and Friday night action. It took forever to get service - more than 20 minutes to be greeted, another 15 minutes to order. But, once the orders were finally in (we had to be active, flag someone down, and then do that again), things came out in a reasonable amount of time. The drinks were stiff and the food was delicious. We shared the poutine. It was delectable and the two of us sharing one poutine and came out completely satisfied. Only marking them down for the issues with service - but it was late on a Friday night so their being overwhelmed is almost understandable. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE IN MONTREAL. The workers were unbelievably rude. The men were middle aged and creepy making the atmosphere extremely uncomfortable. It was a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst place I went during my evening out. I had to wait 20 minutes for a drink and it wasn't even busy. I would recommend going to a place that has more experience dealing with clientele who want specific drinks."}
{"text":"Great location to go for either a drink, eat or clubbing! Yes they have it all. First floor a bar, second floor a bar with a dining room and a live band spot and then the third floor the clubbing spot. Great ambiance, foods are really good with a variety of alcohol. Had a live band that night and just made my night better! Located on Crescent I can't wait for their terrace to be open."}
{"text":"Sir Winston Churchill Pub attracts a pretty young, mostly college-aged, somewhat-international, certainly-touristy type of crowd. So, just by getting a good stereotypical read on the level of responsibility each of these sub-groups possesses, you can pretty much guarantee this place is a Goddamn party. That, and it's named after one of the most famous, most unapologetic drunks in world leader history.

Anyway, upon entering, we were tasked with a choice of live band upstairs or DJ downstairs. We went the DJ route and I've gotta believe we made the right decision, because whoever was on the turntables was pretty much killin' it. Even if the playlist that night was mostly Top 40 hits mixed with a bit of house, he read the room right to get everyone out on the dance floor and making sufficient fools of themselves. I'm tellin' you, I haven't seen this many people grindin' up on one another since my teenage years at the Jersey Shore. Those were special times.

Next, every bartender here is a ten. I think the guys in my entourage drooled over these girls more than the ones dancing for money at various gentlemen's clubs around town. Hypothetically speaking, of course.

There was a VIP section of sorts, with ice buckets for bottles built right into the tables, but this was mostly a place for moving around, so only a group or two of bros opted for that whole sparkler service ordeal. For us, we called it as we saw it - one of those dancing-and-drinking hot spots disguised as an English pub. And because it has the real estate (not to mention the outdoor patio), I imagine this place to be a big hit on holidays, be it Halloween or St. Patty's or some random Spring Break. Crescent was built for shit-shows and Sir Winston's certainly isn't lookin' to break this expectation.

I honestly couldn't tell you how much drinks cost here, which should speak to how good of a time I had simply by the fact that I signed my tab without scrutiny. Really, whatever the cost, Sir Winston's was worth it."}
{"text":"The bartender was fun to be around. She cracked jokes and was very encouraging to let loose and have a good time. I did not stay there long but I recommend the readers to stop by."}
{"text":"Great bar that is a regular place that we go whenever we visit the city! Drinks are affordable,  atmosphere is always fun and lively,  and they make a mean jambalaya! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Oh, I wish i could say more, write more about this place, I really do. But the hammer was dropped here one evening and it was dropped without regard for any day to follow. I really like this bar, and I'd say, it's probably the best bar in all of Mount Royal. Very cool. Very hip. Very decent.  Large in space, and can still be crowded, but still with plenty of fun to be had. I've always believed, at least historically-speaking, that Churchill was a rather reserved gentleman, but his tavern in Montreal, is off the chain!"}
{"text":"A nice little club / bar to try out when in Montreal. My girlfriends and I swung by here for a bachelorette party and ended up staying for the majority of the night. We weren't too impressed with it in the beginning because I guess the night was still young, but as the night progressed (and the drinks were drunk) we began to enjoy ourselves more. There are 3 levels. The downstairs level is for the younger crowd. There are three bars with a DJ and dancing. The second level is a little more laidback with less dancing. There are still bars but there was live music when we were there and they were playing hits from the 70s, 80s and 90s. I'm not sure what's on the third level because we didn't venture that far.

All in all we would probably go again, but it wasn't the best club I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Touristy, young, rowdy, and fun.  I remember Sir Winston when I was 20 traveling up from Dartmouth and getting absolutely hammered.  Well ten years later I did exactly the same thing and still had fun.  That said, this time I was (almost uncomfortably) older than most of the patrons...it seemed like the only ones that wanted to talk to my group of friends were of questionable motivations (I am not going to say they were hookers, but they definitely could have been).

Anyways this is a drink place, not an eat place.  It is either exactly what you want or the exactly what you don't want, there is no in between."}
{"text":"Average job pub. Nothing great but not bad. Took about 15 min after ordering to get appetizers and about 35 min to get meals. Lots of wasps on the patio!! They even saran wrap your drink!!!! 
I have the chicken sandwich as i seen someone else eating it and thought mmm gravy on chicken. I was pleased to find out it came with a starter salad aswell as the fries for only around 11 dollars if that. The sandwich was only okay the chunka inside were dry chunks of white meat chicken ..they probably could have been torna apart a but more. Plain and simple toast with gravy on top and peas. Fries were average not very seasoned or salty.
The started salad was super fresh! Amazing tasting lettuce and tomato aswell as a great vinnigrette.
My sister ordered the scargo.
It was laking flavour but still good. Could have added a touch of garlic.
The waitress also kindly offered bread which was a long bun and tasty.
She also ordered the salmon tartar. There was salmon and if i can remember some fish in it. It was spicy so it tasted alot like jalapeno.
Service was good. Friendly staff.
Got in right away.
You can pay at your table.
The menu is in french and english! Yay!
I dont think i would come back based on tje average food and way too many wasps on the patio (hate wasps) but some of you may not mind."}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular and it's on a nice location in downtown Montreal. The staff here are alright with customer service and drink prices are good on certain nights like Tuesday, 2.50 a shot. They got some comfy loungey couches inside which is great for chilling with friends.

On the flip side, the lineup for this place can be long on Fridays and Saturdays and the dance floor is somewhat limited. The place is also touristy, lots of outsiders come here and can be annoying. 

FINAL GRADE: B-"}
{"text":"Oh Winnie's ! So many happy hours spent here over the years and many more to come i'm sure . They have lots of seating , and a nice big patio to sit out on in the summertime ! They have great happy hour deals and nice fun atmosphere to grab a casual bite/drink with a friend or as a group ! They have 3 different floors , each with their own ambience.  If you do come by later at night on the weekend you may have to pay a cover to get into the first floor , where there's a DJ and a large bar area , with lots of booths and seating , as well as a dance floor that opens up later at night. The drinks are not overpriced and its usually a fun , relaxed atmosphere. You can stay inside for a louder more energetic vibe , or you can also be seated outside (even in the winter , as the patio is heated and covered) for a little bit more of a quiet , sit down type of atmosphere. No need to be dressed up as this is a very casual place. All in all the food is pretty good , the drinks are also good and cheap , the only thing is the service here is very VERY hit or miss. We've had great service as well as horrible service , so that part is kind of a gamble. But , that being said I know I will be back here and I wouldnt discourage anyone from trying ot for themselves, because for the most part its been a good experience."}
{"text":"very good customer service. I've been coming to Sir Winston for over 7 years now and it has consistently been great quality food and nice staff. I've never had an issue to find a table, even during the hockey playoffs. 
The menu is pretty complete for lunch offering a variety of dishes. I wish it'd be the same at night ! 
Price wise it's ok, and happy hour is always really good. However the drinks at happy hour are not as good, clearly diluted with more mix than the regular ones."}
{"text":"Enjoying some live music tonight, great sax.  Televisions are way too small to watch the NFL divisional playoffs comfortably. Has three separate bars on this floor with plenty of bar stool seating.  Friendly warm environment.  Good place for a couple of drinks with a friend."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for my bachelor party.  After seeing the place packed all day and all night, we decided to stop in there for a bite early one afternoon after a night of drinking.  Couldn't be that bad right?  Wrong!  This place was horrendous.  Their version of Iced Tea?  Lipton Brisk.  Chicken sandwich?  About as moist as eating a pencil eraser.  Crab cakes?  They literally tasted like hush puppies... and not even good ones at that.  After having eaten some for an appetizer, it was too late to send the main course back and ended up with four of those horrendous things.  Out of the 5 of us only one guy was able to finish his food - he got the bagel with lox and cream cheese.  Simply put - this place is a tourist trap."}
{"text":"\"Lets go to Jello Martini bar and shake our booties! yay!!!\" 
\"what the eff it's freezing rain outside?\"
\"Forget that sh*t, lets just go some place close by\"

That's how I ended up at Sir Winston Churchill Pub. Fellow reviews say this place is a touristy spot, and I guess since I was a tourist in your fine city, I would have to verify that statement to be true. 

My feelings about this spot are quite mixed. The bartender was great and had such a fun personality that to be honest, if it were not for her bringing together the various patrons at the bar and her liveliness, it probably would have been a very blah night. When my friend and I arrived a bit before 9:30, (seeing that the Metro stops at 12:30) this pub/club was nearly empty. There are 4 large bars on the lower level and ample booths and cozy seating options, so maybe the space fills up later in the night, but don't come early and expect a popping dance floor. 

Here's what is probably the biggest draw back of this bar- the weirdass system they have going on behind the bar. Because it was early and the crowd small, my friend and I got alot of attention for the bartender. She was recommending shots to us and explaining some cool shopping options in the area, and during this time, we watched as she whipped up cocktails for other thirsty tourists. Everything she poured was entered into the computer and the serving size was monitored to the T. The system even went as far as not allowing her to pour vodka into a mixed drink where the ingredients called for amaretto. Talk about control freak. So in result, drinks come out pretty weak. Last drink kinda soft and you request just a tad more rum to your coke this time around? sorry, no can do. Seems like a big bummer to me. In this event, I ordered a beer. Some kind of apricot pale ale that was quite refreshing. We also ordered up 2 shots and they were probably the best 2 shots I've had. See, shots can go 2 ways- super sugary (yet delicious) but lacking in alcohol content OR they can be burn-your-throat and make-your-eyes- water strong while tasting like crap. These two shots though, one was named koolaid something or the other was all alcohol, yet it tasted delish. The second, a broken down golf cart was sweet, very sweet but yummy. It was melon liqueur,  amaretto and vodak (I think) in the shot glass, which was then put in a glass of pineapple juice. 

If I lived in Montreal, I'm not sure I would come here, I have a feeling there are better places, but it was cool for a wet/cold night where I didn't feel like walking too far."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service.  We waiting almost 45 minutes for our appetizers and we had to remind our waitress 2x about it.  The restaurant was not even busy so there was no excuses for this.

Drinks and food were very good, especially the wings.  You must have the wings if you are here.

The fish and chips was also very good.  The amount of fish was very generous.  I know normally there is tons of space around the fish and the batter, not the case here.  There was nothing in between, just delicious flaky fish, I'd order this dish again also.

I would actually overlook the horrible experience with service and come back just to have these wings again."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal to visit some fam and needed something to get into later that night, so my cousin brought us out to Sir Winston. It's a restaurant slash club, I don't know anything bout the restaurant side to this place. This is all about da club.  Sir Winston is on a real crowded street with other clubs, bars and a lot of party goers. You're right in the middle of nightlife central so if you're not happy with the place you can always leave and find something else to get into. 

Small cover to get in Sir Winston can't quite remember how much but nothing to make you think twice about going in. The downstairs area is pretty big and spaced out with all the action converging on the dance floor. There's about three separate bars and some couches scattered about as well. The drinks were kina pricey and under sized, but what's new? The hot bartenders in tight red dresses kina make up for the price of the drink. Shrug.  Oh yeah, the beer bottles are a bit smaller than what you've come to expect in the states, so don't freak out thinking you're hand has freakishly grown overnight when they hand you an undersized Heineken bottle.

I definitely wouldn't call it a mixed crowd, mostly white girls and white guys in their 20's partying hard and having a good time with a few of us colored peoples mixed in here and there. The DJ is spinning all the club hits and Top 40 songs to keep the dance floor packed. I wouldn't know a tourist from a local, but I'm pretty sure this is the spot where new party goers and tourist converge to get their groove on. 

I kina sat back and knocked back Heinekens and some shots wit the fam and friends and hit the dance floor for like a total of ten minutes. it was cool.

If your from a big city, I'm pretty sure you've been to a club like this when you were nineteen and your mama just started to let you out the house and you aint know no better, or probably sixteen for all the girls that snuck out that back door.

Winston ChurchHiLL it's good for what it is. The crowd is there if you want to party hard, and the space is there if you wana fall back and chill."}
{"text":"Over the years I have spent less and less time in the touristy downtown area of Montreal's Rue Crescent and Ste. Catherine Street preferring the lesser known and frequented areas of the city. If you are new to Montreal you certainly want to walk Crescent street which is akin to Bourbon St. in New Orleans...well almost. My desire to return to Churchill's is simple, they make a very good Caesar salad, better than most, in fact, that is what I ordered and I was not disappointed in the least. The salad was followed by their chicken wings and fries with two dipping sauces, again that too was very good. If you prefer to dine outside there is a terrace above the street which is very pleasant and affords you the opportunity to observe the activity on Crescent street below. Late evening can be very intense and jammed packed with folks wanting to listen to the bands and or dance. All in all Churhill's will remain on my menu as long as the Caesar Salad remains on theirs."}
{"text":"I came here to catch up with a friend over drinks. It is located on rue Crescent, so if the weather permits, sit on the terrace so you can enjoy a nice view! Upon entering, we were greeted by extremely loud music. Immediately, I knew that we would probably have to scream at each other in order to hear anything. I'd like to add that there are three floors. I believe the basement is more of a drinking-only atmosphere. It also has a dance floor.

We were seated fairly quickly. The tables are very close together so it can feel very crowded if the restaurant is full. Their drink menu has a pretty big variety, however, their food menu is very limited. There wasn't much that I could order, but my friend got a chicken panini and loved it. Prices were very reasonable as well. I'd also like to mention that our waitress was super sweet, so the service was great. She was probably the best thing about the experience. My friend and I wanted to stay longer, but a band started playing so we decided to call it a night. 

Overall, the music was way too loud, the menu was too limited and the band was pretty bad. There are a lot of other places on Crescent so maybe try one of those."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is that it's open until at least 4am on a Wednesday night!  I was here on a business trip, and my business likes to drink!  We had closed out another bar earlier in the night (I think it was 1am already), so I called up my friend and she was at Sir Winston Churchill Pub so we met her there.  They were on the terrace which is sweet because it's outside and you can see the whole street full of lights.  I can't really comment on the service because I was kinda drunk, but what I do know is that I was never without a drink, so somebody was serving us quickly enough.  I think they have pitchers of wine which is what I was having.  They also didn't mind us pulling up extra chairs to our section (we had over 10 people in our party), so that was nice.  Inside it was very dark with a long bar and I think a dance floor area.  I met a very nice girl at the bar and we had a nice conversation.  Overall it was a great place to bring people on a late night business trip!!  Wish bars in Cali were open that late!"}
{"text":"I've definitely experienced better. If you're with a large group it can be fun, but the space is limited, which can get claustrophobic at times (especially on a Friday and Saturday night). 

Drinks are weak and the bartenders do not have the nicest attitudes. I know Montréal has very accessible nightlife for the under 21 American crowd, but I was super surprised to see local teenagers getting dropped off in their mother's minivan and then picked up at 2am from this place...it definitely is not a classy lounge, music was okay, but if you're out late for the night with a group of friends, you can have some fun here, (but stay with them, otherwise creepy young AND old guys will try to dance with you) but it seems like it's the place to be on rue Crescent because people were waiting on line for a while to get in..."}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour specials especially for beer. The only food we tried was french fries and they were good.
I really like the outside seating with heat lamps. It's sort of open but mostly closed off. The waiters are really nice!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. The ambiance is what brought us here. Service was OK. Food was terrible. We ordered a specialty, which was their pizza. It was a frozen pizza for sure, not fresh. It was horrible."}
{"text":"I am a tourist, so tourist trap or not, I thought the food and service was good. We don't have these bars/pub thing in the states, so I wanted to take my husband to one and get the Canadian experience. 

I ordered the fish and chips which are probably some of the best I've had - ever (even including those in England). The fish was extremely mild, the food was hot and light - not greasy. Fries get a huge thumbs up too for the perfect mix of mushy insides and crispy outsides.

My husband had a frenchified version of a cheesesteak. Lettuce, tomato, brie and real steak on a baguette. Different, from the Philly version I love but yummy. We ordered Poutine, a local favorite, which was good but not outstanding.

Waitress was relatively attentive and friendly. We were there early on Valentines day so people were coming in in drips and drabs. Only spotted one other tourist group though, so there must be something worthwhile for locals to come back for. Perhaps the two for one specials? All in all, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Winston Churchill is one of the more popular bars on Crescent, and for good reason. During the day, they have great drink specials (including a gigantic Hoegaarden) as well as a balcony for dining or drinks. Their waitresses will also politely laugh when you ask who the portrait on the wall is.

But at night, it's a whole different story. There will be a long line to get into the basement ($10 cover for guys, $5 for girls). Once you get in, you'll be packed like sardines if you go anywhere near the dance floor. The bar and the side room are pretty accessible though.

Music was good, but we didn't stay long, as it wasn't conducive to large groups. Oh well. Pretty hostesses though."}
{"text":"I popped to Sir Winston's because I was hoping to have a terrace to enjoy the sunset and while they do have a nice terrace, it's only on the second floor and the next door buildings are rather tall. And the terrace was packed to the gills with folks already.

So I sat inside at a window, enjoyed a beer, enjoyed some wifi and moved along."}
{"text":"This place is fun! It was nice out both times we went (yes we went twice because we liked it) so we sat on the 2nd floor terrace each time. It has a nice view of all the bars on the street and all the beautiful women of Montreal. The cocktails are decent and our waitress was awesome. She gave us ideas of great french places to go around the city. Overall, this pub was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and people watching from the elevated terrace.  Get a table on the outer railing. Vibrant crowd inside."}

Sir Winston Churchill Pub Complex has 3 Floors and each floor has its own scene.

At the first floor there is Sir Winston Churchill Pub. It is hip with a stylish ambiance. One can meet up with friends, socialize and party.
At the second floor, you have Winne's an english pub style bar-restaurant. The decor is luxurious. 
And on the third floor you have Karina's Club Lounge. It is an intimate lounge that serves wine and digestive menu. 

What i like at Sir Winston Churchill Pub is the two for one drink specials. You order a beer and get an other one free of charge. Ask the waitress about it before you order. I do not think this is applicable during weekends.
In addition, they offer free nachos, sausages and pizza. This isn't the best food you can find, taking into account that they are free during the 5 a 7.
For a person who likes to enjoy good quality food, I would strongly suggest to skip the free food and go for the menu.
They have good nachos with cheese and their burger is safe choice."}
{"text":"We originally went downstairs where it seemed to be pretty empty which we found attractive.  However, before we could even think of where to sit the loudest bass on this planet (and maybe beyond) could be heard so we made our escape and ran upstairs where it reeked of cigarettes (maybe from the people in the terrace?) but seemed like a cool enough gigantic bar.  We sat, got served right away.  I order a shot of whisky which is hard to screw up so I have no complaints about that.  The rest of my peeps (3) had beers which seemed to be sub-par at best.  One person said the two different beers they had tasted as if a dirty sock had been sitting in it.  There were two desserts ordered: a chocolate mousse cake and an apple pie.  I did not have any but was told both were excellent.  An oldies cover band started playing.  They were very enjoyable (five stars for the band!) but because I was tired and because I was tired of the bass from downstairs massaging my behind as it made the floor and chairs shake my husband and I left, leaving our much younger friends behind.  The following morning they told us they left shortly after due to about 20 billion 18 year olds coming in.
In conclusion: This might be a great place if you are really, really, really young but for an old hag like me...  I think I'll stay away  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer, ended up staying 3 hours.  This place is awesome and a must stop when in the area.

There are several bars within the place, so if you like sitting at a bar, this would the place to go.  The setting was very relaxed and comfortable.

The food was terrific.  Served hot, quick and lots of it.  My jambalaya was enough for about 3 people and very good.  

The beer selection was typical of most of the places around town, so you will have a lot of choices if you like draft or bottle beer.

Our bartender Rachel was terrific and the main reason we hung out for more than one beer.  She had a lot of regulars in, who were also great people, so we decided to stay longer.  

Definitely make this part of your day when you're downtown."}
