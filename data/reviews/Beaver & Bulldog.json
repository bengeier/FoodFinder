{"text":"I used to come here before it was completely re-branded. Back then it was nothing special, but at least it had decent wings. Now it is just a complete joke. 11 bucks for 6 wings?!?!? Completely not worth it. Most of the wing sauces are gone, as is the dill dipping sauce they used to give out with the wings (ranch or blue cheese is extra now btw). The place was empty for game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals, so I'm not sure how much longer it'll last if it can't even attract people for hockey. I have no interest in ever coming back."}
{"text":"DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE I WENT THEIR LAST FRIDAY APRIL 29th They didn't have nba playoff game going on at night -_- and the bartender said they are not playing today. when clearly they were... (spurs vs memphis) so i was like w.e and we got a pitcher of mgd + 2 lbs of wings wings were soooo overpriced it was 11 bucks for a pound of wings. that is way more expensive than all star wings or wildwings and you know how many wings came out? 6 each for 1lb... 6 WINGS 6WINGSS!! I RAGE UGHHH and it took 15 minutes for this shitty wings to came out. it was so dry and hard (obviously over cooked) and also there was this random dude singing playing guitar so frigging annoying, i couldn't even hear my buddy's voice so we were just eating drinking, and no talking.. no watching ball.. so i dipped asa i can.. :( and u know how much it came out to? 2lb of wings and a pticher of beer 46 bucks. GLAD THAT I WILL NEVER GO HERE EVER AGAIN DONT GO"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. 

The menu here at B&B creates a whole new standard to bar food. High standards that is. 

Order:
Sweet POtato fries - comes with a cool dish with 2 dips, garlic and ketchup. bonus points for the garlic dip. - SOOOO yummmm

Grill chicken and garden salad - not bad. They prepare it exactly how you ask. 
BBQ chkn flatbread - impressive. on the sweet side. Dont expect to see cheese. 
Avocado wrap - EXCELLENT! , not too creamy but has a kick to it. 

Supreme roasted chkn with rice and garden salad. - AMAZING. The chkn was stuffed with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and peppers. The rice was a tad lame but myeh, the salad made up for it. Fresh and not cheap on the red onion rings -woot woot. 
 Burger with friend pOtato chips - Satisfies the \" i want a big fat  burger to my face\" craving but it's nothing special. The pOtato chips were a bit stale. Could have just been a bad batch. 

All together it came up to $93.00. With tip It came upto 117.00 (I'm a good tipper)

Bathrooms are 64% south of the main door. The bar is at the front (circular to the whole room). Keep going right from the main door and towards the end (kitchen door) go right. You'll see the 2 washroom doors. 
The place itself isn't big at all. It's a decent size to fit about 100 people. Music is always playing. Bartender is cute polish girl. Correction, PROUD POLISH. She opted to tell me a joke \" if half the world is polish, what is the other half?\" - obviously I don't know, so i urge her to answer \" want to be polish\" she replied. I'm not polish, i don't look polish, I'm the furthest thing from mistaken to be polish. I guess it's funny, in a far distanced sort of way. Who knows. I just came to the bar to get my beer and perhaps run into some random conversations. 
Service is good, so the tables clear fast. Crowd is so so. You'll see a weird group of truck drivers and young kids on one end. The other you'll have a family and a couple. Over all, friendly to all groups, couples , friends, singles etc. 

Ladies: The owner is a bit of a creep and WILL try to kiss you. Move your hand around like your swatting off a pesty fly. You should be fine after this. 

Fri&Sat nights there's a poor, music loving, guitar playing sucker that gets oh-so lucky to get a gig here. Welcomes requests. 
note: he DOES NOT play RHCP or Black Keys well, specifically scar tissue. Sad times. 

Not bad, i would definitely come back for the food alone. 
p.s they changed the sign now its a snazzy B&B. I assume they are trying to class it up. Personal opinion? - bad chess move.

{"text":"First time first impression-- great!! Going back Monday for their half price  wings to try the rest of the flavours. Had the Dragon and the Jerk  wing sauces and must both were good enough to get me to want and try the rest"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place: on one hand, B&B has the best chicken wings in Mississauga (and definitely Top 3 in the GTA).  But on the other hand, coming here on half price wing night (Tuesdays after 4 pm; $5.50 for 1 lb) is an extreme test in patience, hunger, and your smartphone's battery life.

During my most recent visit, my party of 4 had to wait an hour before we were seated.  Apparently, peak time extends aaaalll the way until 9:30, which is only 15 minutes after we had a table.  On such a packed night the management should institute a maximum time for diners, or at least make sure that if people are hanging out they're actually purchasing.  Seriously.  I'm not just saying that because I have no patience and may or may not be bitter.  In the hour I was waiting, this one group of girls went out for TWO smoke breaks, and I can't forget the additional two breaks they took once I sat down.  Oh, and the dudes sitting in the booth at the back?  Don't think I didn't notice there was only one (empty!!) plate of wings between the four of you, four (empty!!) glasses, and the fact that you were there long before I got there and only left maybe 10 minutes before I did.

That said, our server was so nice despite how busy the place was.  For example, my mom's coffee was cold, so our server gave us two free dipping sauces.  The owner/manager has an excellent sense of humour as well, which helped take some of the edge off the hour-long wait.  Yay for great service!

And last, but certainly  not least, the crown jewel of the Beaver & Bulldog establishment: the mighty chicken wing.  Their variety of wings is insane, and by insane I mean \"I wish my stomach could handle eating even ONE of each\".  I think they have at least 30 flavours, all conveniently organized on a scale of spiciness.  I recommend the Parmigiana, Cajun, Dragon, Thai, and something-Peppercorn.  I've yet to build up the tolerance to try their Exorcist flavour, aptly described as being so spicy your head will spin.

Next time I visit, I'll definitely have to come in either a group of only 2-3, right at 4 pm when their special starts, or after 9:30.  And try their Chipotle wings."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the service! The manager came out to see us and chatted with us for about 5 minutes. Very friendly staff. We were 7 and we all enjoyed our meal. Live band that night was just right...not too loud so that you could still have a conversation. The prices are very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly, prices kinda high, coke tastes funny maybe the ice cubes, don't know.  Burger was excellent fries were good.  Highlight wad waitress"}
