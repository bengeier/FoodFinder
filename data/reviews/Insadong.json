{"text":"Fresh, fast and clean this simple restaurant reminded me of walking into a Kimbab Chungguk in inje, S. Korea. I had dolsot bibimbap and the service was fast, friendly and the quality of the food could not be improved. While the decor is nothing to sing praises about, you can tell every inch of this place has been sanitized. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten Korean food all of 2 times before coming here so I guess you may want to take my review with a grain of salt lol.  I live in the area and have been wanting to come here for a while and finally came tonight for the first time.  Many of the reviews here say this place makes pretty traditional Korean food so I am going to trust that is true, although I don't really know myself.  However, I can say I really enjoyed my meal tonight and the service was excellent, so I will return in the future and try other things.

They bring several sides like kimchi, pieces of potato in some type of sauce, and a few other things free of charge to start with and refill them as much as you want.  We had dumplings to start, I had the bibimbap, my parents had a pork dish and a soup (sorry I forget the names!), everything tasted fresh and the serving sizes were excellent.

The service was very friendly and one of the owners came and asked us how everything was going, if we needed refills on sides or anything, and wished us goodbye - I always appreciate when the owners are engaged with their customers.  There were Koreans and non-Koreans eating there, a mix  of people is always a good sign!

We enjoyed our meal and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I have been to Insadong for the first time since the restaurant changed (used to be Taste of Korea), this past week. 

Myself and one other person shared the Samgyubsal Kimchi Bokkeum (fried pork belly with Kimchi & vegetables) and got a single side of rice. The food was delicious, and the portion was very large. The spice level was great, not too much, but definitely built to a good spicy level. There was a nice variety of vegetables in the dish that were all perfectly cooked. I wish the rice had been included rather than needing to be ordered as an addition.

The woman who was (presumably) the restaurant owner was very nice, making sure that we were happy and were enjoying the food. The environment inside is very nice for dine-in, my only complaint would be that they had those 'diner' napkins in the metal boxes which is frustrating when eating spicy Korean food. Went for lunch on a weekday, it was very quiet and a great atmosphere to chat with your dining company."}
{"text":"Decent family-style Korean food. Overly attentive service (as though we were amateurs and didn't know how to eat a hotpot) - annoying.  It was good, but I think I'll stick to my regular Korean joint. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was definitely one of the better korean spots to eat at. We got the spicy rice cakes, shrimp tempura, pork bone soup, galbi spicy pork & sweet and sour pork. Have to say that everything tasted really good. 
But I'm giving this place a 4 because the waitress seemed really confused and didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. She seemed really overwhelmed. She packed my pork bone soup and didn't even cover the lid with the liquid. I hope she was just new and this wasn't her usually self."}
{"text":"I am Korean and this is a Quaint Korean restaurant in the west end. Small menu but the items I tried (mandoo gook and seafood soondubu) were flavourful and authentic. It seems to be a good place for sharing hotpots w friends."}
{"text":"Had the duck hot plate and it was amazing! This place has great service and authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Had the dumplings, the bimbimbap and the spicy mackerel with some rice wine. Food was excellent, service was excellent. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Really good, real Korean food. Friendly, warm service and delicious comfort food. enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst experience from ordering at this restaurant from uber eats. The food came late and cold. I was sick and haven't eaten anything all day, and 2 hours later I'm sitting here eating this cold pork bone soup. 

1.) the food preparation time kept getting pushed back and Uber or insadong restaurant never called me to tell me what's going on.

2.) the uber driver got lost and kept going in circles around my condo. This man clearly does not know how a gps functions

3.) when the driver finally arrived, he called me and shouts at me on the phone to come to his car and grab the food. I have never ordered food before where I have to walk up to a strangers vehicle and grab the food through a car window!

4.) The pork bone soup was not very tasty. The rice and side dishes were okay and probably the only reason why I would give this restaurant a 2 star. 

5.) I had almost no potato in my pork bone soup unlike the photo on Uber eats site. The tiny piece of potato I had was the size of a quarter. Seriously.

6.) The items on the Uber's eats app are 10 % more expensive than their dining in menu, however the food is not much better than if you dined in. You're paying more to order from uber eats and $4.99 delivery charge just for this nightmare experience."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for take-out and now delivery(via UberEATS).  We've tried donkatsu, yukgaejang, mandoo gook, suhlungtang...all are great and authentic- yukgaejang is my fave!  The side dishes/banchaan are ok, wish there were more options, but the sweet honey potato thingy is so good.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times since I discovered this place a few months ago. Insadong is currently our go to spot for Korean food. They are consistent, courteous, and have really good Korean food that is easy on the wallet and great for the belly. 

My partner and I have tried the following dishes:

Tteokbokki (Spicy Rice Cakes) - with fishcake and sliced vegetables. This dish is good but can get spicy. It's the type of heat that builds with every bite. 

Jae Yuk (Spicy Pork) - which is sliced pork with carrots red peppers and onions cooked in a sweet spicy sauce. It's actually not that spicy for my taste. We get this almost every time I come with a group. There are two serving sizes, the family size (larger portion) does not come with a side of rice but the regular size does. 

Purple Rice - GET IT AND THANK ME LATER

Donkatsu (Breaded Pork Cutlet) - a generous potion for one and great for sharing. It's like having a thick boneless pork chop sliced in half, breaded, fried, and the cook finish it with a generous amount of katsu sauce. I swap out the white rice for the purple rice.

Dolsot Bibimbap (Rice pot)- it was the first time I tried this and therefore have nothing to compare it to. It was a nice medley of sliced beef with beans sprouts, pickled radish and a fried egg. I would get it again...with purple rice instead of white. 

Tang Soo Yook (fried chicken) - bite sized pieces of deep fried chicken with onions and peppers tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. Great for sharing as it is a large portion."}
{"text":"Delicious, each dish was well prepared and to our taste. Highly recommended.

Had the spicy rice cakes, tonkatsu, bibimbap and beef bulgogi. Just the right amount of fire and savoury."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned restaurant, great tasting Bibimbap - try the cold kimchi in the fridge too if you're getting takeout"}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in the walls, being that this is a family restaurant I kind of expected a much more friendlier service which is exactly what we received.  

We looked at the menu and was going towards the big seafood hotpot but we had to say no since that big thing serves 4 and I don't need a food coma so we ended up with the yukgaejang.

Because I judge a Korean restaurant by their kimchi, when it first came out I was all over it....and man oh man was it just right!  I was on cloud 9 with a big grin until the main course came and with first taste...I was in heaven!!  It was so freaking good, think this place has the best one of all the ones that I ever ate at.  

I love Canada!!  
For the food that is"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was loaded with meat. The side dishes were tasty and they offered refills without request. The service was great and the owners are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean joint in South Etobicoke.  You know it's legit because all the Koreans come here too.  The Ban Chan game is on point, especially the Kim Chi and Potatoe in the amazing sweet salty golden sauce.  It's well priced and the servings are huge. The staff is super attentive.  I am a big fan of their seafood hot pot, it's a great value.  Interior was it's pretty simple, great for a casual date, or family meal.  If you are in the area, they also have free parking on the back side of the building, with an entrance to get in from their, so save your money on street parking.  The Bulgogi and Bi stone bowl Bibim Bap are my absolute fav and they knock it out of the park."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and will definitely be back many more times to come! Both times I had the bibimbap with tofu instead of meat (It's so good I don't even want to try other dishes...maybe eventually I will). It's a great portion size for the price of $9.99. It comes with a bowl of rice, a variety of cooked and picked veggies, a sunny side up egg, and just a touch of shredded seaweed. Oh and you can't forget the bottle of sauce which you're supposed to proceed to drown (in my case at least) your food in.

Note: You add the bowl of rice into the large/main bowl that has the veggies and egg, then add a generous amount of sauce, then mix well before you dig in. The first time I had it, I was eating bits here and there and was eating the rice from the small bowl that it came in. The chef/owner (I think) came by and practically scolded me (in an amusing/nice way) for eating it the wrong way and not mixing everything together - oops! She said bibimbap means mixed rice in Korean. Once I mixed everything together, the dish became 1000 times better so make sure you do the same!

The sides are all also very tasty. My favourite is the kimchi - it has a very pleasant flavour without being too overpowering.

The service was very friendly both times. I definitely recommend you check this place out! 

Tips:
- Pay at the counter once you finish your meal
- Huge parking lot in the back. Turn into where the large painted mural wall is."}
{"text":"The staff were extremely friendly and courteous. The food was tasty (we had the gamjatang jeongol for 2) and portion was huge! Side dishes didn't have a lot of variety but it was very fresh. I would come here again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff, solid food, big portions, large parking space behind the building = 4 stars 

Glad to find another good Korean restaurant in GTA!
What I liked the most about this place was service. The staff here are attentive and friendly. 

My boyfriend and I ordered spicy pork sizzling plate (~$13) and hangover stew (~$9). The pork dish had a good amount of pork as well as veggies. It could be a bit too spicy for some people but not crazy spicy for most people for sure. The stew was okay, wish there was more meat in it. Side dishes were mediocre, nothing special about them. Complimentary rice was moist and well-cooked. 

Worth to check out the place if you are in the area. I would have to say this place and Chaban (another Korean restaurant in Etobicoke) are pretty much neck in neck except Chaban is a bit pricier and has a more modern ambiance to it."}
{"text":"Insadong is a brand new Korean restaurant in the Etobicoke area that I was lucky enough to try out shortly after its grand opening. I was born in Korea and formerly lived in the Yonge & Finch area (New Koreatown), so I like to think that I have relatively high standards when it comes to Korean cuisine. And even by my (self-proclaimed) high standards, Insadong does not disappoint.

I ordered the Donkatsu (deep fried pork cutlet) and tried a piece of the Jae Yuk (spicy marinated pork), and I have to say, both were phenomenal in their own right. The Donkatsu was cooked to perfection and tender like you wouldn't believe. Furthermore, I'm not the biggest fan of spicy food, but even I could appreciate the flavour and kick of the spicy pork dish.

I'm thinking of bringing my parents to this place for a family dinner next time I get the chance, and they're even more picky about authentic Korean food than I am. Next time you're in the area kraving for Korean, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My new favourite korean restaurant in the GTA. I work down the street and have been coming here since it opened last year. The owner is very warm and friendly. The food tastes like my grandma's home cooked meals, better than North York restaurants. Get the soups/stews here, or the spicy pork."}
{"text":"I believe there is BETTER Korean food in West TO/Etobicoke.
I won't name any, don't wanna get this review removed or anything...
i felt the bulgogi was average at Insadong, had friendlier eating experiences in West Toronto/Etobicoke (not to be named...)."}
{"text":"We were here one evening at the end of Sept.  Life has been crazy so I didn't get to writing this review until now.

I had the bim bim bap.  Hubby had bulgogi or something like that.  Delicious, and we ordered this delicious chicken dish (its for 2 people and a little over $20).  You need to try this.

Cute place, and they clearly get a lot of regulars.  It was really tasty and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for take out. The food is very authentic Korean, definitely my favourite in the West end area. The staff are all quite friendly in comparison to other Korean restaurants. 

My favourite dish is the kimchi pork belly. It's a large portion good enough to feed two people. I also really like their Kimchi, which is served fresh. Some prefer the aged kimchi which they sell in the refrigerator for take out. I've tried it once and it's just as good! 

They have a large parking lot at the back. 

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good gamjatang (pork bone soup).. On of the best gamjatang in TO. but galbi(ribs) was not so good"}
{"text":"Good place to get Korean food. I don't mind driving to North York to get Korean food, but it's nice to have a more local option. The owners are super friendly and the food is authentic. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This is a small location my friends, boyfriend and I went to after our visit at the AGO. The place isn't very modern and looks a little run down.

With eager staff ready to serve, they quickly sat us down. We were given two menus per two people, so I didn't really have a chance to look at the menu.

I wouldn't say their food was out of this world, I mean it's edible to say the least. They didn't have much selection for someone like me who has dietary restrictions and has to be careful what I intake. The prices of the food were pretty fair, reasonable.

Overall, it's not a bad place but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my second favourite Korean restaurant for Korean dishes and my favourite place for Kimchi. I usually buy one or two packages of their Kimchi to take home. Service is always good, servers and owners are very friendly. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not bad! Yet another better-than-average Korean restaurant in the west end, where portion size and price meets good value. Located just northwest of Bloor Street West and Islington Avenue (not too far away from Islington subway station), this place is a clean and casual joint (plain decor but spotless tables, cutlery is swaddled up in cutesy Insadong wrapping). Street parking is available in front of the restaurant, the food is decent, and prices are reasonable.

We visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM, and it wasn't too busy. While there weren't many dine-in patrons, there were quite a few people popping in to pick up their take-out orders. We ordered the Beef Bulgogi and Bibimbap, and overall, it was quite good. Not the best, but still quite delicious. The beef was nice and tender, and both dishes had a decent amount of flavour to it. Insadong also provides a decent array of side dishes, and are quite generous with portion size.

While I still prefer Chaban as my favourite Korean spot in the west end, this place isn't bad, and I'd come back again! Good for casual meals, but not necessarily a place you would take a fancy or semi-fancy date."}
{"text":"The bibimbap and gamja tang were really good. Cheap and food was quick too! Banchan is typical of a korean restaurant. Would definitely come back and try their other stuff too."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit, and we were all thrilled! The side dishes were excellent, and  refilled! My kids, who don't like kimchi, truly enjoyed today's kimchi. The mains were also really good - excellent pork and beef, and enough for tomorrow's lunch.
We will absolutely be coming back to try the shared dishes."}
{"text":"This place we really good! 

Ordered the spicy fried chicken, the tonkatsu dinner, the spicy beef and fiddlehead soup, the dumpling and rice cake soup and the seafood tofu soup.

The spicy chicken was full of real chicken, but it was not as crispy as I like it. 

The tonkatsu was huge and crispy and good! 

The beef and fiddlehead soup was also delicious and super hot when it came out. Very authentic tasting. 

The dumpling and rice cake soup was super delicious, the soup was great, the rice cakes perfectly cooked and the dumplings were meaty. 

The seafood and tofu soup was underwhelming. 

Service was average and ambiance is non-existence. But the place is super clean."}
{"text":"FREE PARKING IN THE BACK. It's hidden and entrance is on the right side of the building. Cute local family owned Korean joint."}
{"text":"Hands down the best kampoongi I've had.. the ddukbokki was perfectly spiced as well, my mouth waters just thinking about it. I had the pork bone soup which i thought could have been a little more flavourful, but thats what i get for ordering that dish in the morning, im sure in the evening, when the pork bones have had ample time to stew it would be just perfect like the rest. Excited to try the rest of the menu, especially the korean style hotpot!"}
{"text":"One of the better bibimbops I've had. And their big pork belly with kimchi dish was delicious."}
{"text":"Tip:  Apparently there is a huge lot around the back, West of the restaurant.  Be sure to turn before the row of restaurants, otherwise you'll be doing a u-turn in a busy area!

Restaurant itself is bright, clean, newly reno'd.  Initially, I thought Insadong took over Sikgaek, but it's actually just West.

Staff were very friendly, attentive, and asked how everything was at least 3-4Xs.  So be prepared for that.  At least they care and it does show.

Food, as per other reviewers, were better than your average Korean joint.  We ordered Spicy Rice Cakes (app), Yukgaejang (spicy beef soup), & the \"plainer\" Mandu Gook (white, non-spicy broth).

Bachans were ok, nothing really stood out/wasn't begging for refills.

I had to Yukgaejang and it was on the saltier side.  So I can only assume that anything with that red, spicy broth would be salty as well.  It was still tasty, especially on a cold Winter's day.  Next time, I'll try the plainer Mandu Gook!"}
{"text":"Great little place to get great Korean food. The staff are very kind and always ask if we want more side dishes. Food portions are HUGE and come out quickly, and hot."}
{"text":"Love this place! A true hidden gem in the islington village! We usually have the navy hot pot, love the spicy sausage! It is only $25 for two people! The staff are helpful and super friendly! I've had the chicken teriyaki and really enjoyed it, the chicken was cooked well and great quality! There was enough for two people to share. Overall each time we visit we are surprised and full! Give it a try, this place is unpretentious, simple, yet clean and quite delicious! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, in my heart, I want to give this place a five star.  The food is very well prepared, and it is 100%, authentic, true to their roots Korean food.  The panchan has never been the big draw here, but the food itself, especially the ttukbegae dishes are lovely.

The pro's:
Shared an appetizer (tofu) - agedashi.  Authentic.  Nice amount of dried kim and bonito flakes.  Quality soya sauce - nothing rough.  Spouse had the yukkaejang (very nicely done with kosari namul) and I had my usual godenjo jjorim in a rich, thick, gochuchang.

The con's:
Place was not full.  Asked for a slightly larger table and we were given some nonsense (by the waitress) that they were waiting for a party of six (reservations).  This was not true.  The \"party of six\" never arrived.  That pissed me off.  Asked for tea, she said \"the teapot is broken\".  Just say, we don't have tea today!  Two small things which spoil an otherwise good (food) experience.  I am tempted to reduce this to a 3-star but the owners are nice people."}
{"text":"Great food and affordable prices, family owned and managed restaurant. The owner is very nice. My favourite dishes are the yukgaejang and the kkanpoongi! Authentic korean taste.

         ."}
{"text":"I have been going to Insadong since it first opened back in March. It is a family run restaurant with lots of authentic Korean dishes. My favourite is the boodae jeongol (army hot pot) and their kimchi. 

It has a large parking lot at the back which is really convenient. It's fairly priced and the owners provide warm service."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with friends. We had the Insadong special stew made with lobster. crab, and other assorted seafood and vegetables hot pot. Very delicious and we all left stuffed. So good, will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had dinner the other night, order a variety of food and it was all delicious.  The waiters were friendly and efficient and the owner came out to chat, it was a really warm and inviting, like going to a friends house.  The place was clean and parking in the back is so convenient."}
{"text":"I've had Korean food a handful of times and I must say this is top on my list. Aside from the delicious food, the service was awesome! The staff are very friendly and are willing to help you any way possible! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Did not have much expectation in the west end of Toronto for Korean food as we usually go to places in north York. Staff were friendly and efficient with service. Food came out quickly as well. We tried ddukboki (3/5), spicy pork dish (4/5), and sulungtang which is beef bone soup (5/5). The soup was excellent and I couldn't believe I finished the entire bowl of broth. It was so good I kept drinking it pretty much. Would definitely return next time once back in the area for more of their soup!"}
{"text":"Among the best Korean food I've had outside of Korea.
The bibimbap was excellent, and the kimchi was perfect.
Very friendly wait staff, and one of the owners came over and chatted to ensure everything was to our liking.
We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I came at a bad time but I was pretty disappointed with both the food and service here last night. 

Service: We asked if we could get a seat in the back upon entering because it was pretty chilly in the front but was told the whole back was reserved.. but to us it didn't seem like it was as different groups that came in after us were seated there. Throughout our meal, we tried to ask for banchan refills but were ignored and when we did tell them (twice) they never came back with any, same thing with the water refills. Even paying took a while so we decided it would be best to stand at the cash and were ignored until they noticed our credit card in hand.

Food: Got the spicy rice cakes to start and the pork bone soup as a main. The spicy rice cakes were extremely overcooked and soft, but the sauce was good so it was okay. The pork bone soup contained 4 chunks of pork and almost no soup - I had to take out all the pork and tilt the bowl for any to get on my spoon. Because of this, the pork didn't absorb any of the soupy flavour so it really was just pork bone and rice for me.

Meh."}
{"text":"Really would've given this place 3.5* Food is ok. I've had better Korean food in the area."}
{"text":"Had the hot pot version of the pork bone soup, the donkatsu, as well as the spicy rice cakes. Thought all 3 dishes were very well made and delicious, they had the feel of a homemade dish while having that professional and well rounded taste. Nice cozy environment and great service! Over all really enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped by Insadong (used to be Taste of Korea).  Much needed freshen up. Place is clean and modern looking. Staff was nice and friendly..most importantly has to be the food and it is A-OK in my books.  We order way more than we should but managed to do a lot of damage.  

I really enjoyed the tteokbokki, it was just the right amount of spice.  The shrimp tempura was quite light but really crunchy alongside the dipping sauce which was really nice.  The pork bone soup was great was they have lots of the green veggie in it. Most other places don't have them.  The dolsot bibimbap was also delicious. Everything came out piping hot which was a plus for me. The order of sweet and spicy chicken was really delicious, has subtle tangy flavour and right amount of spiciness made it really good.  

There were many other patrons who ordered table cooking of BBQ as well as stews.  I will definitely be back to try all the other dishes.  One really great thing is their menu isn't huge but all the essential dishes are there so I can actually go and not be overwhelmed by it."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with limited basic seating.  Friendly staff eager to serve and please.  Food arrived fast. 
We had the 
KOREAN spicy rice noodles (ddukbokkie)
Fried chicken with sweet n mild spicy sauce.  
Mackerel 
Bulgogi with chicken 
Bibimbap"}
{"text":"I came across Insadong on yelp and saw a photo of their special hot pot and wanted to go there ever since. I took my boyfriend and his mom for dinner around 5:30pm on Sunday. 

Area: Clean and it gets filled with customers pretty quickly. 

Service: The owner lady was so nice! She was so wonderful and the staff was very nice as well. It wasn't that busy when we got our food so we chatted for awhile. 

Food: I was worried that there wouldn't be enough food but trust me, it's good for 3 to 4 people. We got the Insadong hot pot. They gave us four bowls of rice, side dishes, watercress and noodles to put in after we finished all the seafood. WOW, so much seafood and you can definitely taste the deep seafood and garlic in the broth. It was really nice on a cold day. After we were finished with the seafood, we dumped the noodle into the broth and ate again lol. 

Loved it here. Would go here again!!"}
