{"text":"DON'T COME HERE, IF YOU WANT TO BE DISCRIMINATED FOR BEING GAY!
I should expect it, coming in on Sunday night NFL. Full cock fest of straight men, what I didn't expect is when the group of guys kept point & laughing  at me and my man. The bartender was laughing & high fiving with them!!!' You obviously don't care about your guests our your life. As a bartender, you pay your bills with your tips yeah? Why take fucking sides? I was going to tip you FAT, as I work in the industry myself. Instead your lucky I gave you $4, my boy had to calm me down the whole time and it was a horrible horrible experience. So disappointed in this company! You were my go to bar, because of the level of customer service I get. 
Not anymore, I'm telling everybody not to come, specifically not THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on with this place. It used to be one of the best bars in SW Vegas. The level of customer service has fallen off big time in recent years. Last week I went there with a couple of friends around 9 pm and sat at the bar. The bartender came over, said hi, and then walked away. We didn't see her again for like 15 minutes. When it's 90+ degrees outside and you just want a cold beer, it sucks having to wait 15+ minutes to even put in your first order.

If the place had been super busy, I probably could have understood, but it wasn't. Similar \"lapses\" have happened in the past year or so, although this was the worst by far. They also have a problem with adding extra stuff to a bill \"by accident\" and still trying to charge you for it after you pointed out the mistakes.

This is a nice bar in a nice location so I hope management can fix the problems asap!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Always enjoyed the Jones location and was happy to see a Henderson location open.  Went in tonight for the first time, around 9:30 pm.  We were greeted by the bartender, who told us we could seat ourselves anywhere we liked. We did so, at a table clearly visible to the bar. We sat there for over ten minutes, watching the staff walk around, chat and socialize...and we weren't acknowledged again. No menus, no \"I'll be right over\"...just a few glances in our general direction but no effort to provide any sort of service. No one said a word as we got up and walked out.  Drove over to Hash House A Go Go,  and were acknowledged by four or five different staff as we waited for our order.  Someone had their act together tonight, and it wasn't Sierra Gold :("}
{"text":"Such a beautiful facility... food was disappointing... but service was horrid.  40 minutes for an appetizer to come out.  Just an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service has been hit or miss. Some nights you get the right attention and others not so much. So far I haven't been impressed enough to go out of my way to come here instead of a PT's closer to my house."}
{"text":"Been a regular at Sierra gold for 3-4 years, a valued guest I had felt for years especially when Homer was the bartender, if Manager Steve as well was present. But a few months ago Homer left and I felt that service at Sierra gold would not be the same. That you're not felt welcomed nor treated with respect. A couple months past after Homer left that I had not visited Sierra gold, one night in September 2013 decided to give this place a chance & we did, but as a to go order! Sat at the bar and was greeted by Mike. Two of us sat at the bar, he gave us 1 menu and didnt offer us drinks. Rude and not appropriate. 
Gave him multiple chances and service at all times with Mike was so bad. He doesn't offer new drinks when your first glass is empty, does not provide silverware when you order food, doesn't check up on you when food is dropped off and you eat. Drops your check off and stands there on his call phone texting for 15-20 minutes until you call him to get his attention. 
He's over all rude. Is extremely selective with his guests and who he choses to take care of and respect. Discriminates and is  prejudice!!! You go out to a bar to drink and eat but simply Hoping to enjoy a simple night unfortunately, this place especially with Mike as your bartender can ruin everything for you. 
Please let him go. It's not worth keeping him. Customer service is not his priority!!
Really ZERO stars for Mike 
5 stars for the cooks especially on graveyard shift , exactly the great workers we forget their names, the ones that matter most, the ones that provides excellent customer service!!! He the cook cares more about me in those few minutes of interaction, than with Mike!!
Never going back to Sierra gold times literally 100 and more guests!! Finding a new local spot!!!"}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is consistent with the food all the time. The appetizers are great for games and seating is great for viewing of games. 

I had the potato skins, wings, and pizza with a group of friends. It was a great variety for a group during Sunday football.  

I recommend for the beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Went there the other night with friends in the beginning the service wasn't horrible but it seemed as soon as the rest of our party started to arrive the server seemed less present and more irritated. Only two of my friends ordered food and the other three of us only had about two drinks each. Two of my friends were waiting so long to put their drink order in that they gave up and just ordered at the bar and brought their drink back. Also right before happy hour ended we put two drink orders in and the server responded with \"okay I'll put your order in but it probably won't be happy hour anymore\" my other friend stated we still had like 5 minutes and she replied \"well I guess I'll run\". With a very unpleasant attitude! Of course when it came time to bring us our tabs she was very pleasant in that moment. We all payed separately so we each tipped accordingly keeping the service we received in mind. She probably got a fifteen dollar tip total for the whole table which I think  is pretty good for the service we received especially since it was just a table of 5. Well after paying we headed for the pool tables almost immediately after she approached us. She actually had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong and why we didn't tip her more! She told us she was really upset that we tipped her so low.. I was so shocked it was ridiculous and unprofessional It really made me wish I hadn't left a tip which was just a courtesy really. In the end we felt uncomfortable because all the bartenders and servers were staring at us  so we ended up leaving and most of us agree that we won't be returning to that location."}
{"text":"We have been trapped in Henderson for two weeks while dealing with our rental home here.  Joy, Lisa, Christy, Mike and Brittany have been a wonderful escape for us!  The food is good and the service even better.  Sports on every TV and an outdoor area for the sunshine.  We will always come back and visit our home away from home!   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people.  The food is good and the service was fine but I would not come back here with a group. If you reserve a private room maybe but otherwise the atmosphere is more like a restaurant than a bar.  There aren't any pool tables or areas to lounge. The chicken nachos were fantastic and I also had the gilroy pizza (garlic cream sauce and salami!!)"}
{"text":"Wen here three times. Fist time the service was good and food was good. The next two times it was like we were an inconvenience but the food was still okay.
It's almost like you have to be a local to get any attention.
I will never  go back."}
{"text":"I give a 5 star rating for their graveyard shift. Always great service by Homer...he's a gem that makes everyone comfortable."}
{"text":"Great place to get away and drink a cold beer. Great atmosphere to hang out with friends I recommend it if your in the area ."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch A LOT lately, ha ha.  I've had three different servers and the service has always been good, I don't think my drink has ever gone empty.  Of course my favorite server is Christy as she usually brings us some nice, warm, free cookies for dessert.  Christy's cookies are the best, no euphemisms here!

Most of the food has been pretty good, my faves so far are the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  Mmmm, I wish I was eating some now instead of this cold pizza hut, yuck!

I enjoyed all of the wraps except for the fajita wrap, ugh, hard to explain but it sort of had a slimy texture.  Just not too good.

Most items come with fries or you can upgrade for a 50 cent charge to curly fries, onion rings  or several other items.

Today I had the french dip.  Pretty standard operating procedure here except for the Flamin Hot Cheetos battered onion rings that accompany the sandwich.  Sounds awesome right?  Using something that's been fried as batter so that you can fry it again.  I have to hand it to them, it's a great concept.  The execution, however, isn't quite there.  These should be orgasmic and they just sort of taste like onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, I like getting my O Ring face on but I thought these would be better."}
{"text":"The food is strong, cost is reasonable.  Servers and bartenders are  meh though.  Much better than other local options."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since hearing its like PT's but a little better. Went for happy hour which I'm not sure what time it started but was until 7pm. It was PACKED!! I've been to PT's on Silverado and Maryland for HH and it was never this busy! 

It kind of dark inside but had a nice ambiance. Although quite busy, there were several tables still available. There are pool tables which weren't in use either. 

First off, our waitress said we would have to buy the beer and bites members card in order to get HH prices. PT's never made us buy that, nor did my friend say she needed when going to Sierra Gold previously. Weird. Anyway, that card is $5 but you get $10 to use immediately and you build points on it for whenever you visit and eat there. What also sucks is that their HH is for drinks and thin crust pizza's ONLY. No appetizers. Bummer!

Ordered a couple drinks. I tried one of their specialty drinks call grand smash which was grand marnier, lemongrass syrup, sierra mist and mint. It was pretty delicious!  Also, got bucket of chicken wings, garlic fries and their Gilroy thin crust pizza. The gilroy was awesome!! It had white sauce, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pepperoni, sausage and tomatoes! SOOOOO good. 

The bathrooms were very very clean! And while washing my hands, I noticed there were tv's in the mirrors!! Cool! lol. Our waitress was very friendly and when my bf asked what beers were on tap.. she pretty much went down the whole list and would have continued if my bf didn't say he got the point. HAHAHA.

Overall, its a little far for me to go to HH often.. but I will return if I'm ever near one again. Its a lot nicer than PT's that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Sierra Gold Aliante is AMAZING!!!  My husband and I especially love their spectacular bartenders!  The food is great and we enjoy this bar a ton!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place for fantastic breakfasts!  Bacon, eggs and potatoes are cooked to perfection!  If you can get there between 6 and 10 am, the breakfasts are half price.  This is one of the few places where you can get a generous deal for under 15.00 for two people.  The breakfast choices are all delicious.  We've also been there for lunch. Truly, their burgers are the best in town."}
{"text":"Love the Sierra gold in Henderson. .... this one on Jones plain sucks!!! Takes 15-20 mins to get acknowledged at the bar. ..then another 5 or 10 to Get a drink.    One of very few places I've came in and sat waited and finally left. ...tonight I sat at a machine plaYed forty dollars and only saw a bartender from a distance..... I will never come back! !!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place--and it is open 24 hours. Good price, great quality pizza, great beer. What more could you ask for ^^?"}
{"text":"Nice place to go to have a beer and gamble if you're into that but do yourself a big favor and stay away from the breakfast menu the food is greasy and tastes terrible I had the chicken fried steak and eggs the chicken fried steak tasted like it was cooked in oil that had been in the deep fryer for a week I couldn't hardly touch it the staff is very friendly but I'll take my dining experience elsewhere"}
{"text":"A decent place. Good prices on drinks and the food is above average here. But service here is horrible. Seriously, whoever owns this place should find better help.

Mostly the night bartenders are great, but the bartender that works during the day, is HORRIBLE. Only two patrons in the place at noon, and she was rarely at the bar....was hanging out in the kitchen most of the time. And it would take easily, 10 minutes to get another drink from her. 

I couldn't believe my eyes but I actually saw the other patron reach behind the bar and pour himself a drink because nobody was around. LOL. I just hope that person worked there."}
{"text":"The best place to have a party. The staff was amazing from beginning to end!  The room upstairs is very private so hire a DJ and get as loud as you want."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Hosted a baby shower here in the banquet room and the staff was so helpful! Their bartender Crystal was extremely kind and courteous. I had a great experience and will be suggesting this place to friends when they are looking for somewhere to have an event."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible everything!! Gaming sucks! Bartenders suck!! Food sucks!! The only reason for possibly a 1 star was because of a sweet server that walked by and said hello"}
{"text":"My Mom and I come to this place all the time during the week and have amazing service in the day shift. We come back not because the food is good but because of the staff. They are friendly and outgoing. Thank you to Kristy, Lisa, Brittany. Last night was a different story. We sat in our favorite seat and the place wasn't too busy. I've seen it busier. The waitress that we had we had once before and she was so terrible but my Mom decided we should give her a second chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! Colleen is by far the worse server we have ever had. She wouldn't look at us she kept telling us to wait before we could have her take our order (20 minutes we waited to place an order) . When she did bring our order she slammed the plate down, while looking in the other direction. We tried to make small talk and she would walk away. She obviously doesn't enjoy her job and made it more than clear we were not a priority to her. When we finished our meal we were discussing if we would get dessert when she shoved the bill holder in my arm and stated, \"you weren't getting dessert were you?\" as she walked away without waiting for our response. We should have never left her a tip but we left her less than 10%. Sad for her we tip between 20-25%. Honestly, if I walk in and she is the only waitress I will leave immediately. She is so bad for your business and you should really think about giving her less hours to be near customers or maybe she should work in the back where she has no contact with people!

She won't stop us from coming in because we love it there but we will make sure we NEVER come in when she's the server."}
{"text":"Probably the best lunch I've had on this business trip so far...I ordered the pear and goat cheese salad, served with baby spinach and candied walnuts.  Everything was delicious about this salad with the exception of the pears.  I was expecting fresh pears, but instead got these sugary brownish mushy blobs which had no pear flavor whatsoever.  Must be canned...

Note to self...Just push mushy blobs to the side and enjoy your lunch."}
{"text":"Had breakfast twice their the past week and the service was great , steak & eggs are very good and cooked correctly. The restrooms are clean , pool tables, and.cold beers!!"}
{"text":"Being in the industry I've  experience some of the worst bartenders ever at this bar , ok let me explain

1. Brady  who supposedly is the manager , when you're gambling I always thought drink for complimentary at least one so when the guest sitting next to you which was me drinking beer and the players drinking tequila shots obviously depending on what you play you come the players drink not the person sitting next to you beer , this guy had the audacity to tell me he comps the least expensive drinks whoever's playing or not
 
2. Today 10 /4/15 decided to give this bar another try for  football season, we ordered shots of Don Julio silver chilled the bartender again same bartender Brady proceeded to pour patron Reposado not chilled , when I told the waitress the shots were not correct Bradley was irritated and upset

Listen there's 300000 bars in this town of Las Vegas tighten up your game and get rid of your bartenders cuz they suck!!!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot because its close to home and they have a few good wing flavors, but everytime there is a problem, shorted us a bucket of wings, gave us the rest of the order wrong, they don't make orders you call in and  pick up, apparently they forget they took them, I will continue to go here and never leave a penny for a tip"}
{"text":"So NOT impressed. I used to love this bar, but it has gone so far downhill in service, they should be embarrassed. Maybe I just don't have the right anatomical parts, because the female bartender only paid attention to the men at the bar who were gambling. She ignored us to where we still had NO plates nor utensils for when our food finally came....and there were Maybe 15 people at the bar.  We even had to wave down a server as she was going by and she was nice enough to bring us set ups and plates. Food may be good, but they are now off my fave list. I hate poor customer service almost more than anything!"}
{"text":"One of the best sports bars.  We got the back area (3 tvs and plenty of couches and chairs) reserved for $20!  The food was great as well; greasy but great."}
{"text":"We had the worst waitress. Her name is Latoya and she had the worst attitude  I have had in a while... I have been a server and you have to smile through your day even if it sucks.   I ALWAYS  give good tips but I didn't leave her a dime... everyone in my party said she had attitude. I was the only one who ordered anything so I drank my  drink paid my 7.50 and left"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Reasonable prices. Pizza is thin but good.  And the wings are great"}
{"text":"I enjoy the happy hours specials, especially the pizza & beer. Restaurant is dimly lit and a little outdated looking, so nothing special on that front. If you are looking for an inexpensive dining experience that gets the job done (nothing above that), then this place is not bad."}
{"text":"I like the over-all atmosphere of the Sierra Gold bars and the food at all of them is pretty good.  My favorite is the Soup.  Rice, carrots, celery, straw mushrooms, bell pepper, and meatballs in a rich chicken broth!  Comfort and goodness!  The service is nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what to order, so on Daria's recommendation, I tried the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It was FANTASTIC! The pork was extremely tender and perfectly seasoned. The homemade BBQ sauce was delicious as well. I like the sandwich better than BJ's Brew or Gordon B. 

Give it a try and tell Daria I recommended it..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Classy bar, if bars could be classy. Drink menu sucks. Nothing is made fresh. Water is tap, straight from their sink. Gross. Ordered Island Girl from the drink menu. Horrible, it made me feel like I was at sleazy night club. Husband ordered Angry Balls, which just tasted like watered down fireball. 
Really liked the look of this place in the inside. Just wish I could have gotten a good tasting drink. Oh, prices are good too."}
{"text":"Best local bar in Summerlin. The staff is amazing, super friendly and provide excellent service. Bartenders know how to make delicious mixed drinks. Beer & Bites specials are some of the best deals going on food. Overall, awesome place!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to sit and chill at the end of a long day. All the employees were friendly. Food came out on time and was tasty. I haven't tried the steak yet but plan to on my next visit. The drinks are reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I never heard from anyone from Sierra Gold Management. It's quite sad, seeming as the corporate offices are located right behind this location. 

Way to go Sierra Gold."}
{"text":"This location ROCKS!!  The service is excellent and the food is made fresh.  This is not your typical bar food!  So tasty and the portions are ample!  Even the side salad is WAY better than other bars that I've been to!  And then there's the BAR!  Clean, rich woods, high ceilings and a relaxed atmosphere.  Overall, I will be back over and over again.  Maybe I'll become the Duke!"}
{"text":"Slow service .. When its not even busy , i guess you have to be known by the bar staff in order to get service !! Not coming back here .. Not even to use the restroom !!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. And if you like Cheese, order the Nacho's."}
{"text":"Excellent service with a classy atmosphere. By far the best bar in the area. Bartenders are polite and pool tables are nice. If you're looking for a place to meet friends that offers gaming, pool and a lounge this is it. Also suggest asking for a dirty bong water shot. One of the bar tenders secret recipes"}
{"text":"Where do you go when the night is young and you just want an ice cold beer and some food? 

If you have not stopped by this place then you are missing out. The bartender Justin is the man. He greeted us the min we walked in even though the place was packed and invited us to sit at the bar. I was with a group of about 5. We took up the far east side of the bar and was asked immediately what we would like to have to drink and if we would like a menu for food. I swear this guy must have been reading our minds because we were starving for some great food.

After looking over the menu I decided to go with the General Taos boneless wings. As I placed my order Justin yelps out good choice man!! and he was right the bucket of wings had a complete fulfilling amount of food and was the best boneless wings I have had in a long time. 

If you have never been to a Sierra Gold then let me explain the atmosphere. The easiest way to do so is its a PT's with out a pool table and darts!!! Ok so you have never been to a PT's well get out of your house, get off the CPU and go enjoy life for a min hang out with some friends and enjoy the upscale yet casual bar with lots of seating room to grab a good meal and have a great conversation! 

Like most bars they have video poker machines and a few arcade games. I was surprised that there was not a pool table or darts but I think that the Sierra Gold chain is trying to reach more modest people rather than the younger crowd that PT's is trying to reach. Either way this is a great place to grab a cold one."}
{"text":"This place use to be really good. Good food and good staff. Paid $10 for 4 chicken breast sliders that were not even real chicken, more like formed chicken with rib meat and chunks of fat. Slow service. Messy bar. Only comped one pint of beer after gambling $1 hands at blackjack over 2 hours. Definitely not what I remember coming too when I still lived on that side of town a year ago."}
{"text":"Was in town on vacation and my Sun devils were playing that night. So I saw that the Alumni group has it's game watching parties there, so we headed over. It is a good drive from the strip, but once you get out there, it looked like a stucco oasis in a strip mall. (Cue the blowing tumbleweed)

Then I walked in... WOW! Nice place. The party was in one of the VIP rooms with couches and comfy sofas with big ass TVs! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly waitress and she got my drivers license and automatically got me a players card and a drink. Works for me!

It is true - for happy hour, they have 50% off their thin crust pizzas! And they are really good. Had the nachos and some wings too! Really good food! 

The service was good, the place was clean, and it had a really good crowd. The only thing that sucked was the devils lost and having to drive back to the strip! LOL!"}
{"text":"Stop here every time I'm in town. Order a beer - half cider half bud light. Amazing appetizers. All menu items are priced fairly and taste amazing. Great pretzel bites. 
bring a jacket - they run the AC on high all year"}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with this place... My boyfriend really wanted to go here so we decided to swap Jason's deli (which is right across the street )for this place. that was a bad idea, the service was horrible they made us wait so long and charged us for things without letting us know first this is the second time I've gone to a PT's run Company... Even our first experience at PT's was absolutely horrible...  The servers acted like we were a nuisance and they didn't even want us there it took a long time to get our food and the even messed up on the order And still charged full price for it. But on a lighter note the food was actually very good my boyfriend got a steak salad and I got a hamburger and it was very very good so my suggestion to you is to call it in and pick it up and enjoy you are meal somewhere else. I really wanted to enjoy this place but I guess the hunt for a good pub and eatery is still on in full force!"}
{"text":"It's Great place to hangout and great food they have all kind of food and every thing good"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service SUCKS! First we sat for a while and waited until the servers finished their argument over which one would take our table, ordered, ate,  then continued to wait for our check until we were informed our server left. What was supposed to be a quick bite took over two hours. Seriously lame!"}
{"text":"If you love happy hour then I would recommend this place! Great specials and great prices on beers. Every time I go during happy hour I am never let down. I recommend any of the pizzas they offer, but I truly enjoy the BBQ chicken pizza. The mixture between the sweet tangy BBQ sauce and chicken just hit the spot as I'm washing it down with a cold glass of beer!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Kristy, Chris, Britney, and others.  They remember names, drinks, and other little, often overlooked things.  Breakfast is half off, drinks are half off from 5-7, and the pool tables are pretty good.  My favorite, go-to place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just drinks and video poker."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go and enjoy a good meal drinking a beer and watch sport. The food is very clean and tasty and the place itself very clean and very nice and polite people I do recommend to go and enjoy"}
{"text":"I would give 3 1/2 if they allowed me to. Great place to stop in for some beer, good food, and the games. Ample bar space for gambling and plenty of tables for bigger parties. They even allow you to reserve their \"Locker Room\" for private events. Check it out"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner the service was terrible sat at the bar for 15 minutes even though the bartender walk by she seem into helping the regulars more then me. When people starting smoking in there were food is served I had enough,that when i left I will not go back!"}
{"text":"I thought the machine seats were reserved for slot players. At least 50% people sitting were not playing. Management should look in to that losing lots of money."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for lunch. Food is fantastic. Service is remarkable. Bartenders Heather, Drea & Katie know their stuff & remember what I drink & eat even though I'm not a regular. Having been a server in college, I appreciate great service."}
{"text":"Still not happy about the happy hour changes but this is still top shelf food, drinks and bartenders - especially Ashley (weekdays) and Brandy !!!"}
{"text":"I've never done this before and usually brush off any bad experiences I have. This location was beautifully set up, and had an awesome happy hour and maybe it had something to do with it being busy ? I have to say I was pretty embaressed I invited some people here to have drinks and dinner I had probably the worst all around service I've ever had. They were either under staffed or the waitress we had was miserable but mmm we had three different waitresses and they were all the same miserable! Sorry to you loyal customers but I will never go back:("}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times.  The half price pizza and beer during HH keeps us coming back.  I did try a burger one time but regretted it immediately so it's HH pizza from now on.  No trivia machine was another negative (PTs Pubs have them though).  The place is clean and in a good location.  There are definitely better places for us nonsmokers. I'll give them a 4 because of their HH alone."}
{"text":"Service is great and especially food is aweaome"}
{"text":"Stopped here twice in one week to eat after the UNLV/San Diego State football game, then going there for Monday night football. I love this place, a wide range of high quality food, friendly wait staff and some goo specials going on during the games. 

There is one section I particularly like for watching games, is in the northeast corner ,there is 2 flat panels on one wall and 2 on another and 2 large booth/bar chairs to fit 6-8 people comfortably.

We have already made plans to watch our teams bowl games and am positive it will  be a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Love the late night happy hour here

The food and discounts are amazing. Great drinks decent machines and the pizza rocks

Nice music and ambiance. Very comfortable with a great staff. 

Stacey who works during the days rocks. Funnest bartender around highly rec"}
{"text":"Was my favorite place for happy hour, pizza and pretzel bites. I went there on 4/19. Was very disappointed to learn the happy hour was changed from half price on all drinks to only domestic beers and a few other drinks and half price on only a few starters, not the pretzels. Then we received the pizza, was not tasty at all and hardly had any vegetables on it at all and was tasteless, not the mention $2 more than it used to be. I  asked the waitress if they changed things recently, she said yes and apologized. Service as great but definitely not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports , service could be a bit better tho , best tasting wings so far that I've had in Vegas . Always get the party bucket with curly fries.
Go during happy hour cheap beer"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to watch Raider games at the beginning of this season. My long time fave dive bar, Shifty's, finally closed down for good...moment of slience please...

Like any football fan of a favorite team, I prefer to watch my team at a bar designated as a Raider bar. Haven't found one yet to my liking, so I figured I'd just stop in at a place close to my house.

Nice local bar. Very clean and kept up--this is no dive bar. Good place for sports watching--lots of TVs, and a decent amount spread out away from the bar. Food has been tasty so far...they have a decent selection of cheap eats. Beer menu is good--lots of micro brews as well as the usual macro stuff.

Service is excellent--shout out to Lita who's a server there!

Only 1 complaint--they could use a few more drinks specials geared towards the football crowd--but other than that, great spot to watch a game, or to just hang out."}
{"text":"Time for an update. Haven't been at this place (nice place but horrible management that nickels and dimes people) for a little while and I heard that there were a bunch of changes in management, etc. because the profit and loss numbers there have been so bad.

Perfect example of a company that doesn't know how to hire people based on the demographics of the area they are trying to serve. 

Food is still overpriced for what you get and It's MORE than obvious that this company turns waitresses into bartenders / managers and doesn't hire professionals so they can save a buck or two.

Super nice place though. It's more than obvious there was some money spent on it.

However, was playing the machines with buddies drinking away. Super cutie girl next to me also playing the machines couldn't seem to get a drink so I ordered one up for her. We go on our way to visit downtown for some shenanigans and leave nice tips for the cutie bartender not thinking we have tabs after putting in over $100. (No idea what my friends put in but I was in over $100 on the machine I was playing.)

On our way back from Downtown, we swing by to get breakfast before going home. Upon entering, The graveyard bartender hands me a bill and states that I walked out on a $50+ tab!!

Of course I'm in shock after playing that whole time and look at the bill.. charged for everything including the drink I got for the girl next to me who was also playing the machines!

I told him I was playing the machines and didn't have a clue that I would be charged after blowing over $100 on the tight machines there but it was too bad, so sad. Pay or leave..  Handled it horribly. Could have possibly taken the time to look at my players card but I've had issues with him in the past with charging me for everything when playing so my response to him wasn't very pleasant. I'm a very laid back guy and it takes a lot to piss me off. 

My first review of this place was nothing but stellar with the original staff. Unfortunately I guess they were too good in taking care of people and were fired because \"corporate policy\" for this particular location is to nickel and dime you which is so odd considering most of the PT'S owned locations take care of the gamblers from my experience.

Over 20 years of experience going to PT'S joints and this one is by far the worst experience when it comes to comped drinks if you are playing the machines.

I will say this is the nicest bar in the area.. however they can't seem to keep a staff around that has a clue on what it takes to keep good customers around. My favorite bar is Sago's but it's pretty far for me but I'll pop in every now and then and the staff is super nice / remembers me, takes care of me. (Pretty much the same staff since the night i first walked in there.) Charlies Down Under, a half mile down the road from this Sierra Gold is the same way.

This particular location just can't seem to get it right and has run off so many good customers a class on what NOT to do could be offered at UNLV just using the history of this particular location. 

Place should be jam packed for how nice it is in this location but more often than not it's empty unless it's happy hour and that's because they run people off nickel and diming them..."}
{"text":"Terrible service every time I've been forced to meet people there and I've gotten sick twice from eating the food. If you're cool with that, the place looks cool."}
{"text":"They may not always have it, but the half-price breakfast is beyond compare. The portions are huge, the quality is superb , the atmosphere is lovely, and the waitresses are very sweet. The steak and eggs and the chicken fried steak are amazing."}
{"text":"Had lunch today and would probably not go back.  Resturant is clean, but food and service is another thing.  Waitress acted like we were a bother to her from the start.  Never once smiled or acted like she cared if we were there or not, pretty much acted bothered the entire time.  I ordered the red, white and blue sandwhich off of the \"specials menu\"  It was shredded deli turkey on a dry roll with no flavor what so ever.  Not at all what the description of the sandwich on the menu said."}
{"text":"Service was great, in and out for lunch in less than 30 minutes.  The food was not great got the Philly cheese steak.  The sandwich was so salty I thought I would have a heart attack before I go to my car.  I normally do a good job at cleaning my plate not on this one.  I will be spending the remainder of the day hydrating to flush my system."}
{"text":"I frequent the Aliante Sierra Gold and find it near perfect.  My experience at the Henderson Restaurant was the worst I have had,  ever!  Food service took forever to arrive,  was cold,  and not up to par for a slop house.  They did adjust my Bill which is to their credit however I will never go back there again.  This was my second  time there this week.  The first was so excellent that I took my wife there today...
Then I get very slow disservice.  Even the check took forever. So much so I went to the kitchen looking for my server! \"Oh, sorry, we had to get an order out \" was the servers response when I found her.  TERRIBLE, STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"This is a PT's!  Says nothing about PT's on the outside.  On the inside, it is all PT's.  So, you get that crappy PT food when you are expecting something different. I felt swindled.  

I read somewhere that this is a \"high end\" PT.  High end? That is like saying Popeyes is a high-end KFC.  

And the food is overpriced.  

Nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is always tits. Best service, providing that you're not an asshole hopping up in the bathroom, or rude to the staff. Shouts out to Tracy and Jacob, best bartenders ever, and conversationalists."}
{"text":"Last night was my last night spending time with my friends before I move away, and we met here because it was close to our work.  We sat at the bar to play Keno, I put $40 in and one of my friends was playing too.  My friend that didn't play ordered fries and mozzarella triangles.  Which there are only 5 mozzarella triangles on that plate and it's $9, but whatever bar food is always overpriced.  

What really got me was the female bartender hardly did anything for us at all.  She acted like we weren't even there, took our glasses but didn't ask if we wanted more drinks.  I would look at her and wait for her to see me to ask her for another drink but she just walked away. There was an employee off the clock sitting at the bar and our bartender was just standing there talking to her, it looked like she didn't care about anyone.  Whoever the supervisor was walking around the bar didn't even seem to notice that this girls customer service blows. We were super nice to her although irritated, and in the end we were still charged for every single drink even though we were playing.  not one drink was comped, great last experience at a Vegas bar. NOT!"}
{"text":"Gotta love it, fun good prices good people and only 5 dollar unlimited pool table games"}
{"text":"Flamin' Hot Cheeto Onion Rings... as their menu says, \"just order them.\"

This place is a regular stop for me when heading out to Vegas.  Great staff, great happy hour specials, TV's all within sight, and no attitude. Just an overall cool place to have a brew and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Loved it for years because it was the only smoke free bar in the area. The food and service were great, too. Now that they allow smoking we rarely go any more."}
{"text":"The only reason Im not giving this place 5 stars is because they have raised prices on some of my favorite items. Other then that. This place is amazing! My lady and I have been coming here since they opened in July 2011 and have witnesed the changes throughout. We love Heather. She is so customer service orientated. She makes everyone feel welcome to newbies and regulars. Cant say enough good things about this place, especially during football season. Go Seahawks!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a work trip as I tend to do. Got the veggie pizza sans cheese. It was pretty good, though I miss the variety of veggies you can get on a pizza in europe. I kind of feel like the veggies available on most pizzas in the US are what I call \"filler\" veggies, basically onions and bell peppers. It would be great to get some grilled veggies on pizzas out here like squash, eggplant, and of course your typical mediterranean veggies found in higher class joints. But a man can dream...

Anyways, the pizza was good. In fact it was half price when I went, not sure why since it was so late. They have an ok selection of beers on tap, but all in all the prices are pretty good and theres enough variety to make it worth going to. Everyone I was with enjoyed it.

I also stopped in for breakfast before catching the plane out of Vegas, but I dont remember what I got, so it must not have left an impression on me.

I think this is a good place to go for late drinks and food/snacks with some friends."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times with the same horrible service each time.The bartenders all just walk around in a circle, doing nothing! They act like they are doing you a favor to get you a drink. Wake up management, work on your customer service!"}
{"text":"It's been always out favorite hang out place coz it's just by my house. Our group always comes here to drink and eat. They have the best chicken wings! Best service and friendly servers :)"}
{"text":"I have visited this location at all different hours as I work in the industry. Happy hour breakfast menu is superb!!! Country fried steak and eggs and pancakes at 1/2price!! I love it !! And dinner time 1/2 price drinks and pizza.. My prayers have been answered!!! The gilroy is absolutely amazing and Matt makes a killer filthy martini!!! The wait staff is always super pleasant and very knowledgable about the menu and new liquors!! And graveyard is just as great !!! Love this place and ill definitely continue my loyal business!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here for happy hour before and had the worst service. Today, Nicole was attentive and the pizza was packed with toppings. I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Worth it only for happy hour prices. For 6 people it was only $60 and everyone got drinks and ate until we were stuffed. I really enjoyed the ground beef nachos and gilroy pizza. The pizzas are really thin and flavorful. Nice atmosphere and chill environment."}
{"text":"My husband and I met his client at Sierra Gold for a late mid week dinner. There were quite a few guests at both the bar and in the dining room. 

We sat down and had our drinks fairly quickly. After his client arrived, our waitress came back to our table promptly. We ordered my all time favorite: the Flamin' Hot Cheetos Onion Rings. OMG, yummy. I would recommend giving these a try. We had to get a second order because for 3 hungry men, and me, one order was just not enough. :) 

For dinner I had the BBQ Chicken Salad. First off, let me say that typically I don't order salads at a place that serves \"pub style food.\" A burger or pizza would probably have been more appropriate. However, I'm on a mission to stay away from junk, and considering my guilt from the Onion Rings I tried to keep it \"healthy\" with a salad, dressing on the side. Not a great choice, but oh well, lesson learned and it wasn't horrible, just not good. Caramelized onions were in a giant heap, lettuce wasn't plentiful and overall the dressing lacked flavor. 

My table-mates all ordered burgers and sandwiches and they were all satisfied with their meal. 

I'm sure we will return for more glasses of ice cold beer and this time....pizzas and burgers :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always been happy with what I've ordered.  Sierra Gold is like an upper scale version of PTS so its better than the average fried up bar food.  This time we were strictly going for the happy hour.  What is better than 1/2 off drinks and 1/2 off pizza aaand $2 Dos Equis??  When we came in we were immediately greeted by the bartender.  Off to a good start.  We were seated in the dining area.  The dining area wasnt totally full but had a handful of tables.  The bar area was full though.  Apparantly those are the best seats in the house. ;)

We ordered our Dos Equis-a solid drink and one of us got a specialty drink.  For appetizers we got the Pretzel Bites with honey mustard and cheese sauce.  I love them and get them everytime we come here!  Our friends got the Jalepeno Poppers which they said were pretty good too.  And then there was the 1/2 price pizzas-we ordered 2 (one buffalo chicken and one bbq chicken).  Seem too good to be true?  Yes Yes.  These werent pizzas they were gigantic crackers with over cooked melted cheese on them.  These pizzas were so thin that if you stacked them on top of each other they would still be thinner than my cell phone (Galaxy S2 mind you). LOL  They weren't awful but no one really was ready for the no crust crunchy cracker pizza unfortunately.  

The service was ok. The only time we saw our waitress was when she brought us the food.  We actually went to the bar to order another set of drinks instead of waiting for her. The bartender chicks were very nice and took our order right away as soon as we walked up.  BTW the girls outfits are totally cute. ;)

Now I would have given them one more star because their food has always been pretty consistent from what I remember.  I just thought for the pizza \"happy hour special\" that brings people in would be a little more than we expected.....You get what you pay for I guess....a 1/2 price pizza cracker. LOL  I'm not mad at it, I just will get something else next time....and some people might like a crunch to thier pizza.

Random:  the pretzel bites are the bomb. I love them.  The seared ahi tuna with the wasabi sause is amazing, the wings are yummy and their sandwiches have always been good. We will for sure be back.  Half price drinks are always a reason to go we will just skip the pizza and order what we know. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on grave shift one night and the bartender. Homer I think is his name is freaking awesome. It was super busy. He was by himself and he was slammed but he was able to handle the situation. I wad impressed. He is one of the most efficient bartenders I have seen.  Btw..philly cheesesteak was awesome."}
{"text":"Visited Sierra Gold during happy hour for the first time.  1/2 priced beer = a large beer  for $4 (I had a Guinness that was probably 24 oz).  The pizzas are also half price = about $8 for a huge 2 or 3 person thin crust.  They had additional Saturday specials and the one I had was the \"Knife and Fork\" sandwich -a Philly cheese steak on toast with a sunny-side up egg on top and then fries on top of that.  Awesome for $5.  The space is cool with very high ceilings and lots of interesting seating areas.  The servers were friendly and attentive except for a little while when they were slammed with lots of customers arriving at once."}
{"text":"The food is great, especially the pizza and wings. In fact, I haven't had a pizza there that I didn't like, and the wings have a lot of different flavor options. But the service is so aggravatingly slow! If you sit at a table, even on a slow night it takes a while before someone will ask you for your order. I will probably go back at some point, since it is so close to home, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Go here if you plan on sitting for while, eating and drinking slowly; skip it if you are looking for a quick beer and a meal after work."}
{"text":"Jessica is the best server EVER! Veronica is the best cook EVER! Food at Sierra Gold is always yummy. I love the nachos and fried mozzarella. The ahi and salads are really great too. Anything Veronica cooks is ALWAYS good. I go here during happy hour often for half priced drinks."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold invites you into a very comfortable atmosphere with good quality food & satisfying craves to enjoy whether one might be there for televised sports, video poker, or simple just sitting down at the bar or amusing seating area.

First thing to keep note: HAPPY HOUR everyday from 3pm-7pm & 12am-4am (50% off all drinks & pizza)

As for the food:
_Thin crust pizza (not a fan, but just got sold with the quality & outcome of the pizza that's served here)
_Bucket of wings (so many favors, garlic parmesan is a favorite)
_Bucket of curly fries (gotta love'em)
_ZOOKIE (too good to be true! The warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, & dizzled with chocolate/caramel just hits the spot to that sweet tooth crave)

Service could have been better, but what do you expect at midnigt: top noch service? (minus 1 star)

I have yet to try more & what's best: this local spot is open 24hours!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this establishment the last two weeks. We come here every Sunday to have drinks, watch football and hang out with our favorite person Ms. Mary (who is amazing and loveable) However they are unable to split the sound on the patio so we can listen to the game...instead it's on baseball. I understand you need to please the crowd but as loyal locals who spend money weekly it's a let down. Luckily mary said they play football on Mondays so...maybe we will have to start doing that instead (the stars are for Mary)"}
{"text":"I don't know any other Tavern in Alliante area that can compete  with Sierra gold , try the burgers they are amazing I mean I went there second time just for a burger ,cause first time it was so good that I was literally craving more of that goodie , I am not a burger expert but looks like fresh or at least very high quality frozen either way it's really good. Bartender are very nice to the one with a big boobs (sorry can't remember her name) was super attentive and on my second visit she clearly remembered my name and the choice of a beer ,great service good food and the beer is a beer can't say anything about it."}
{"text":"When you don't want fast food burgers or typical bar burgers, walk don't run here. Avocados won't be reported missing, a slab of Ortega Chile takes the a burger to a whole new level!  Fresh ingredients unapologetically adorn your burgers here!
While the burger patty could do with a little seasoning that alone is our only complaint. Fries are thick, but if you enjoy spicy heat you simply must order the spicy Cheetos onion rings! Waitress Lisa is welcoming and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Do not play the slots. If I could give the bar 0 stars I would. This place is terrible. The slot machines are some of the tightest in town. The service is barely passable. Most of the bartenders need to put on more clothes."}
{"text":"This has grown to be our go-to spot! We have been here a couple dozen times... our favorite place to have a chill drinking night. They have happy hour from midnight to 2AM, where drinks are half off, 50% off pizzas and 5$ appetizers. 

Among everything, this place wouldn't be what it is without the amazing people who work here... Homer is hands down one of the coolest bartenders in life! Same with Kristy & Toya, such nice genuine people. They always greet us so warmly and we always have a good time because of their energy! They seriously make the whole ambience for this place! :)

We usually opt for a few drinks (I go for sweeter drinks like a zombie, mai tai, etc... He goes for a jameson & ginger) and we will order a pizza. They're all extremely good -- are big fans of the STEAK FAJITA PIZZA, as well as the ROASTED RED PEPPER & ARTICHOKE... oh, and can't forget THE GILROY! All delicious!"}
{"text":"Andie is the bomb! She is the best and I look for her every time!  Great food. Lisa was our server."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food and drinks. Bartender was not great. She started off with joking with us. But when we joked with her she wasn't having it. By the time we paid she said to me that she was \"not fond of me\" and she threw my friends check at him because there was a discrepancy on the bill."}
{"text":"great service, hung out with friends watching game 7 enjoying a few drinks and hotwings. BTW the hottest hot wings they have are not hot at all, very tasty but not hot."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out in the southwest.  Right off 215 and jones, it's convenient and they have an extensive menu of good food.  They also have pretty good specials for happy hour and a good crowd.  Seems to be a place people like to hang out on the way home from work.  I've been coming here for years and it's one of my favorite places to stop in vegas.  They have gaming as well and private rooms to watch games, etc."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my house so it's the perfect place to pop in from time to time. We decided to stop by after playing some football to watch some football. Everytime I've stopped in it always looks clean. Grabbed a table top across from the bar which is in plain view of all the tvs. 
The waitress stopped by originally & didn't seem too friendly at first. She took our drink order which was a special on mugs for $5. When the waitress came back to take our order she was in better spirits. There was a special request by my friend who wanted a grilled cheese sandwich w/ bacon, but w/ a burger in the middle. The waitress was kind enough to find out the pricing for it & provided two options for the request. 
My friend def enjoyed her grilled cheese burger. I ordered the ham sandwich which had apples in it. It was so tasty & the fries are the bomb. Everything was solid.
The only downfall I would say is that I did notice someone smoking which made me realize why I don't visit this establishment often as there is no patio to escape to. 
They do have happy hours, however it did not apply on this day due to the time we stopped in."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I thought it was a really nice place, we rented a private room to watch a program that a coworker was being featured on, and the decor all over the place was really cool.  I ordered a glass of wine for my wife and bottled water for myself and it took alot longer than it should have, the bar had a  few people in there but it really wasn't THAT busy, but we eventually got our drinks, I tipped appropriately and when it came time to order my next one, I heard lots of \"be right with you\" from a few different people, and lots of eye contact, hand raising, waving money,  but no service.  15 minutes later in a bar that isn't busy at all, I ended up just walking away, of course at that point the girl asked \"what can I get you honey\".  I just said \"never mind\" and now I know not to go in there again, a shame because we initially thought about renting the room from them again in the future. Also, no waitresses came into our room to see if we needed a refill or took away any empty glasses, which is usually the case in other establishments, but there were several walking around the rest of the place.  Oh well, you heard it here, maybe this place is more into taking care of their regulars and ignoring the newcomers, or maybe it was just an off night, either way, they presented nothing for me to want to return."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here, I'm Portuguese and always trying to find breakfast spots that serve Linguisa and they do here....24 hours a day! Clean atmosphere and the machines actually give you play!"}
{"text":"Like Pt's but better. More variety of food and slightly more upscale"}
{"text":"on the evening of 12/4  we stopped in and waited for 15 minutes. No waters not even greeted. The bartender watched us come in and never bothered to help us. How ever he did continue to help the belligerently drunk guy who wouldn't stop burping. Seriously, this guy was so wasted he kept yelling \"I'm driving home im driving home drunk!!\" Finally after listening to that and being neglected for 15 minutes we walked out. Never again! lost a loyal customer! I have had the food before it is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had.   The bartenders ignored their guest. One server talked with 3 men at the bar and never acknowledged us-than got pissed when we said something.   I will never go back and I will tell everyone I know to never go there. Im a manager in the service industry and if I witnessed my staff behaving how they did they would have been fired. You need to teach your staff about customer service."}
{"text":"Their games don't play. I understand as a vegas local that we are going to lose our money but this Place is a joke..... In every sense of the word. As somebody that lives here I would never stop in here for a bite to eat, there are places that are generous and appreciate local business. This is not one of them!"}
{"text":"We are doing low-carb and the salads here are very good...  

The ahi salad is VERY good, and my husband enjoys the Cobb (no blue cheese and avocado on the side) he gets ranch, and it is quite tasty, and I get the avocado, YAY!   

Have you had Ahi down the street at Hank's in GVR?  Sadly, or wonderfully, the ahi at Sierra Gold far surpasses the ahi at Hank's....  for many $$ less, go figure!  

The beers are cold, and the service at the tables is good as well.  Not too much, not too little...  We usually see the same servers so they know us, but tonight we had a new server and she was equally as attentive, and got us our happy hour beers before the end of happy hour, so of course... we were happy!"}
{"text":"Standard quality food, although slightly inflated over the PTs prices.  Not sure if that's because of the brass trim decor or because the servers wear leather vests instead of tank tops.

Anyway, lunch was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"What a nice place to go for breakfast.  I'm almost tempted not to report this, but if you go for breakfast before 10am it is 50% off.  We had the Miner's special.  We were greeted when we came in the door.  Pleasantly told we could sit wherever we liked.  Our drink order was taken promptly and very courteously, along with our food order.  They checked up on us to see if there was anything we needed from time to time, without being over-bearing.  The atmosphere was very enjoyable.  
You can't go wrong at this bar / tavern.  We talked about hanging out there for the Superbowl as they have some advertised specials."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a minute, usually drinking. Ate there Saturday night, ordered chicken wings. Got really bad food poisoning 3 hours after eating there. Spent the day on the toilet, puking and number 2. It's now Monday and I still have the symptoms of food poisoning. Thanks Sierra gold!"}
{"text":"This place is nice. It's a high end PT's Pub. So the menu is a great Bar Food Extravaganza. This location seemed pretty dead. I don't think I have ever seen it really packed. I was hesitant but figured why not. Walking in is really nice. Kinda modern with a little bit of sportiness. There was only one bar tender and one waitress. Would of assumed the waitress would of been hot like the ads and pictures display but ehhhh. The menu was pretty decent. Flaming Hot Cheeto Onion Rings sounded good as well as their wings and fingers and variety of sauces. This place can be serious competition to BWW if it was marketed right. We tried the Breakfast English Muffin Sandwich with hash browns. The egg was fluffy and bacon crisp and the Muffin was toasted perfectly on both sides. Also tried the Philly Cheese Steak with Chips. They used Whiz which was good but the meat was a bit dry. The bun claimed to be authentic but it wasn't  The Steak didn't have that flavorful taste like from Pop's or Geri's. It was a decent Cheese Steak. The Chips were the clear winner. Made fresh and almost Kettle Style Crispy. Had Cookoo Seasoning which was awesome. It was addicting like crack. The server said they even add that to the fries. Mmmmm, so my first time in a high end PT's wasn't what I expected but Im sure I'll give it another chance to see if I can get wow'd. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!"}
{"text":"We are locals who have always loved this place.  However, today was a different story.  I ordered a glass of wine.  It was about half the size I had been served in the past.  When I questioned our waitress, I was told that the new management had reduced the amt. served.  Keep in mind, this is not a strip property; a neighborhood bar.  I next ordered the cajun ahi tuna salad which I have probably order at least 10 times.  In the past, the tuna was, lightly seared, still pink, & put into the salad.  Today, the tuna was ice cold & apparently seared in advance & refrigerated.  A totally different & less appealing meal.  I reported this to our waitress who said she spoke with the kitchen staff.  They maintained the tuna had just been seared.  Not true.  We won't be going back.  The PTs corporation is growing by leaps & bounds.  Unfortunately they are forgetting about the locals who supported their efforts."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment with awesome decor, but some of the worst service I have ever had. I've never had a check literally thrown at me after having to fix something that was rung up wrong. 

I ordered a $5 happy hour appetizer. Upon review of my bill, I was charged $7.99 for the appetizer. When I asked the bartender about she said it should be $5. She did correct it (which, apparently, was quite the process). When she brought the corrected bill back she commented that it took forever and literally threw the bill on the bar at me. 

The only reason for two stars is the actual building itself."}
{"text":"Just moved back to this side of town.. Used to go to SG Centennial and was a satisfied customer till I checked this one out . The bartenders were horrible ... Guess they tend more to the male customers.. When I first got there to watch a Sunday night football game it took one of the two bartenders 20 minutes to ask if I needed a drink. DUH!!!
Few shots later a group of guys came and sat next to me. Soon as they sat at the bar the bartenders were so accommodating and asked all 4 of them what they were drinking, mind you at this time no one asked if I wanted more shots. 20 minutes after they were served I was still waiting for one of the bartenders to ask if I needed another shot meanwhile the guy next to me finished up his mug of beer and without him asking she got him another mug pint whatever, I don't drink beer and I'm watching all this and still no shot. I then told the guy how fucked up that was. He then turned to the bartender and said hey I think she wants another shot which at that time was like 30 mins and she finally gave me one 
Disappointed with this SG..."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour every day. Good food. Good drinks. Nice atmosphere. Krystal, our bartender last night was super friendly, engaging, helpful, and eager to help us as her customers. The assistant manager; however,  was rude and looked at us like we were nothing. We even wanted to tip JUST Krystal because she was so amazing, but they split it all. Krystal deserved the tip, not the other lady, but what can you do? Will certainly be back again soon to see Krystal!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to watch football with my boyfriend early in the morning recently. 

The staff was really nice. Very friendly and attentive female bartenders. I was particularly impressed at how well they handled a couple of d-bag bros that continually hassled them. They were obviously regulars. The whole thing was amusing to say the least. 

The food was delicious!!! I know they are affiliated with PT's and have the same menu, but their food at this location is different. They must sprinkle love in it or something. It's damn tasty!! 

The drinks were great as well. I had a Bloody Mary after breakfast. 

This place was very clean and nice. I'll definitely go here again. 

PS: They also had clean restrooms!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to spot on Fridays for happy hour. Now they've cut their happy hour down to 5-7 instead of 4-7. The service is terrible. The pizza has gone downhill. The rest of the food (taste and portion sizes) is inconsistent. Some of the servers should not be wearing those skimpy outfits. After being disappointed the last 3 or 4 times I've been in, I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with my friends! The food was good, the drinks were perfect, and the service was exceptional. 

Sierra Gold has a variety of beers and a cider on tap, the later of which was my preference. I wish they had more than one flavor cider, but at least they had one! We had an assortment of food, but the chicken fingers and fries were the best option. The fingers were a good size, the sauce was good and well mixed, and the fries were great. 

I love the mountain cabin feel atmosphere in here. They even have a spot for groups that is next to wine coolers and is lined with leather sofas and soft lighting."}
{"text":"Been a steady regular here for the past 4 years and I just have to give a shout out for how great this bar is. If your a Vegas local who lives on the Southwest side and works in the industry, be sure to come Spend some time here. It's a really chill place to meet some of the industries best and a good place to come have some drinks and laughs with friends. Cheers to the good times!"}
{"text":"The food here is alright.   I do love the arugula salad. Don't bother with pizzas.    The drinks are good    Bartender staff is friendly and accommodating and there's generally a few poker machines open!"}
{"text":"This is the monthly watering hole for Queho Posse #1919, ECV.  The food's as good as any other Sierra Gold/PTs.  The wait staff are friendly and quick, and the televisions show the latest sports.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Happy hour 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am 1/2 off drinks and pizzas!"}
{"text":"Short version: clean sports bar like environment with  above average bar food quality but extremely helpful and engaging staff. I'd give a 3.5 stars if I could give a half star rating but will round up to a 4 star review because of the great service we received.

Was in town for a seminar and after the saturday session, a few of us were looking for a place to grab some food, have some drinks, and watch the nba playoffs. One of the local guys suggested Sierra gold. It was near by so we headed over.

As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the large center bar. The restaurant was a large, multi level room with a, what appeared to be a VIP section to the side. The overall ambiance felt like a slightly upscale sports bar. The lighting throughout was a bit dim but not too dark to feel uncomfortable walking around. There was no hostess but one of the bartenders told us to grab a seat anywhere we liked. 

We found a tall table with stools near one of the many TVs showing the warriors game. We were quickly greeted by someone and given menus. Only a couple of minutes later, our waitress approached. She was friendly and took our order. We were lucky and arrived 20 minutes before happy hour ended at 7pm so we were able to each order a half off speciality thin crust pizza ($10.50 for happy hour), some beers and an order of spinach and artichoke dip.

My friend's beer came out quickly. I waited about 5-7 minutes but mine hadn't come yet. The appetizer came out about 7 minutes after we ordered and I asked our waitress about my beer. She went to check and quickly came back with my beverage. She said she was sorry for the delay and said she would remove the drink from our bill. It was a kind gesture from her and I'm not sure how many waiters and waitress would do that as I hadn't been waiting too long for my drink but I was not expecting that at all. She earned herself an extra tip and an extra half star rating for her great service.

About 8 minutes after getting our appetizers, our pizzas came out. We quickly realized we ordered too much food. The pizzas were all good and tasty. They were dense enough to fill you up but definitely light enough and not too oily to not feel disgusting from eating it. We ended up taking half of each pizza home since we were stuffed. As for the spinach artichoke dip, the dip itself was good, the tortilla chips were standard restaurant quality multi colored tortilla chips, but the toasted bread was a bit stale.

Overall, it was a nice place that gave a sports bar atmosphere. If I were in the area, I'd drop in again for a drink and some food."}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot and it was not good service at all so I stopped coming but the last half year I have had one of the best continuos service that you can get at a bar. Alex is probably one of the best bartenders you can get. Only reason is 4 stars is because they switched their happy hour menu but it does not reflect on their customer service"}
{"text":"I come from out of town and I always make a point to stop here. Great service, good chile cheese fries and wings. Cute servers. Always a great time here."}
{"text":"Great bar for parties.  They have a very nice private room as well of plenty of seating.  Lots of TVs for the games. Just a nice clean place and they have good happy hours.  50% off breakfast from 6am to 10am everyday.  New food specials every month."}
{"text":"Don't go there if Latoya is working! She's terrible!! She has NO personality. Not only did she act like she didn't want to be there, it was also apparent that our presence was a great burden on her. I'm positive I won't be going back to that establishment."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this place quite often. The food is always very good and the atmosphere is always relaxed and fun. The bartenders are super fun and courteous. Some of the servers can be less than friendly though which is why I only gave 4 stars. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a place that's not overly crowded but has a great mix of patrons, food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. We were greeted as we walked in the door and told we could sit anywhere we liked. It was Happy Hour, so the prices were great. We were so excited that this place finally opened and they did not disappoint us. The food and staff were great!  We will be spending a lot of time at this place."}
{"text":"The service was terrible!!  I went in with a friend to play a game of Golden Tee, have some drinks and a little food.  I asked the bartender if a server was on or if I should go  though the bar.  A server was on and she eventually came over.  I ordered a Ketel One and water in a pint glass.  I was told I couldn't have it in this glass for some reason.  Once she checked with the bartender, she returned with the drink as I ordered it.  I then had to go find the server again so we could order food.  The food came and once again she didn't check on how the food was or if we needed another drink.  I returned to the bar to find our server to order another drink.  I realized our server had left and we had a new server.  She never came over to tell us she was taking over or ask us if we needed anything.  I ordered a new drink and once again we had to go through the discussion about the glass.  She came back with the drink, slammed it down and walked away.  Didn't take the empty glass or the finished food.  I once again had to return to the bar to get the check.  Never again did I see the server.  Upon leaving, we looked around, not one table in the whole place.  These two servers had no other guests the entire time we were there.  Guest service was definitely not a priority to these two individuals.  I have had experiences like this several times here and now I will not return."}
{"text":"One of the best local bars in the city, if you are ever on the jones 215 area its a must check out place! Great food and amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"Bar food is one of my favorite food genres and Sierra Gold has some of the best bar food ever!  We had great service and the prices were ok as well.  Those curly fries are to die for - I'm still craving them!  They have an awesome selection of sandwiches and paninis.  I had the chicken parm. panini and it was tasty!  Oh, and you can't go wrong with a place that serves BUCKETS of fries that are drenched in CHEESE WHIZ!"}
{"text":"Came on an afternoon on a weekday. I secretly love this PT's, and maybe it's the bourgeois in me; it looks and feels much more upscale that the typical PT's. The decor is nicer, it's less smokey, and it has an upstairs, which I've had a meeting at before, pretty swank.
The prices-I'm not sure if it's the same or higher; haven't been in another one in a while, but they do also use the beer n bites card and have the same happy hour and awesome menu (Gilroy, yum)
I stayed briefly, long enough to eat pizza, have 2 beers, and run, but I enjoyed my experience.
The bartenderesses are all lovely and leather-vest clad, and everyone was friendly. Food came out fast, as it was not busy at all during this time. I got to sit where I wanted. 
There are neat little niches too, if you'd rather not sit at the bar.
Ps: there is Sambalatte coffee bar next door if you need sobering-up!"}
{"text":"Just did our fantasy football draft here. Great place. We had two servers. Megan started us off until Amanda got there (some of us were early). Both were very nice, although Megan forgot to give me her phone number. Pizza was good. Biggest complaint would be all of the 49er fans. Guys, it's preseason. Relax. You've got all season to vent your disappointment. Why waste it now?"}
{"text":"Come here infrequently for years for happy hour to meet friends or watch football occasionally.  Always loved the gilroy pizza.  Not always a fan of thin crust, but good from time to time.  

Then I found out about the breakfast specials.  I wish were would get here more often, but don't go to breakfast much when not football season.  Those house-made potatoes are addictive and while not a sausage fan the breakfast burrito is a fun to change up the eggs and bacon skillet.  

Not a beer drinker and the drinks are uninspiring to me.  Never been able to find a cocktail to like here.  

Always clean.  Regular staff that are friendly to repeat customers.  We aren't that frequent, but some friends are.  They try to accommodate however they can for sports."}
{"text":"Met a friend for drinks and sat up at the bar.  Sierra Gold is large and open with enough TV's to watch your favorite sports.  The service was quick and the drinks reasonably priced.  The menu looked good and the people next to us seemed to enjoy there food.  Good location right off the 215."}
{"text":"How do you go from the crossroads of Vegas, to the arm pit of the company. There was a time when no matter when you went in there you would run into someone you know. 
Now it's, walk in the door, look around and say lets go somewhere else.  
Ate a burger last night. Thanks for the diarrhea."}
{"text":"Come here frequently late at night and have gotten to know some of the grave bartenders. Great drinks, and great eats all the way around. Never once have I had a bad meal here and have tried numerous items off of their large menu. The lemon pepper salmon is to die for! Get it with the sautéed spinach and Mac and cheese sides... RIDICULOUS! Also they do a late night happy hour after midnight and all pizza are half off... Such a good deal especially considering their pizzas are fantastic! Highly recommend the Italian pizza. All in all, great place to come in and chill whether you're just getting off work or coming in late night to unwind before going home after a crazy club outing. Big shouts to Alex, Brady, and Chad for feeding me drinks on those late nights! See ya soon!"}
{"text":"I have been a consistent customer since this bar is right next to my house and I haven't had a bad time here until tonight. There was a puddle of water that I slipped on and I informed an employee of the name of Jimmy and he just laughed and when I left the puddle was still there. I also asked why my change was only 4 dollars when my check was 26$ and I gave him 40$ he said it was of two other drinks that he didn't ring up but weren't on my check which made me very skeptical. I'm very upset and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Good was OK, could have used a bar rescue on some.  The onion rings were tough so you couldn't bit through the onion, the salsa was pretty much onions with a few tomatoes and the little toast with the dip were so salty that I cannot image the chef could serve it?  We still stayed and did not complain.  Service was not too bad though!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, had a great bartender name Mike !He was awesome. Never had to ask for a drink, very attentive. Food was delivered quickly, and very tasty! Been to a lot of places, it's the bartender that keeps ya coming back,! Defiantly be back! Thanks for the FANTABULOUS service Mike, see ya real soon"}
{"text":"First time here, had a great bartender name Mike, he never let my glass get empty! Made a great drink, his service was enough to make me a regular!"}
{"text":"I was having a great time until my check came and things that I thought were on football special weren't. football special promotional card has item that aren't included and they didn't do anything to fix it. Terrible. I'll be calling the manager tomorrow because I am so upset."}
{"text":"Hired new late night bartenders entertaining because as I write this I have 2 empty glasses and they are at the end of the bar laughing with friends  .In the 8 years in this neighborhood worst service yet .   Not At all the service I'm use to.  Will scratch 12pm happy hour off my regular stop."}
{"text":"This past week was my first time in Sierra Gold. I thought it was nicer than your average PT's or anything like that and I actually enjoyed it. I sat at a table with a couple of friends but the server wasn't present for at least 15 mins after I got there so I obviously went up to the bar to get numerous drinks. Didn't think too much of it and got my second round at the bar as my friends payed their server who wasn't present at all. Then as my friends and I were going to play pool the server approached us about not tipping her well. I felt that was very inappropriate especially in that type of place. We decided against playing pool and left and now I don't plan on going back because I don't want to be set up for failure again. Such bad service and I won't recommend going to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Good vibes has a chill feel, musics not too loud and the bartender takes care of the customers well. The food is decent as well and the wait wasn't too long"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Worst bartending service, doesn't matter what time i come in, always disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Compared to all the PTs and such around, this one's the best.  It's well lit inside, has huge TV's, great food, great service, good video poker/slot selection, and they play good music.

If you come between 12pm-8am sit with homer at the bar (bartender).  He is seriously awesome."}
{"text":"It's a local joint with your traditional American fare bar food. I love the staff here, shout out to Brady and Alex! It's a relaxed ambience with the bar in the center and seating around it. Masculine decor with dark wood accents throughout. It's the perfect place to go to after a long day of work and a quick drink before going home. Their happy hour starts at midnight, half off!"}
{"text":"The service here is mediocre  at best. The main reason I revisited this place was because they have the best nachos I've ever tasted, hands down. The décor of this establishment is very nice and the coolest part was the TVs in the mirror in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Gilroy Pizza is the bomb-aye! Everytime i eat here, i make sure i savour the flavor of this pizza...My ex-bf and I used to come here a lot to eat and he said he gained like 20 lbs. Then when we broke up, he moved out of town and lost 40 lbs and is now rubbing it in on my face. Pizza here is hella good but I'm sure it's not gonna make you fat like what my ex-bf said...He's just born fat i think...anyways....GILROY!!! whoot!"}
{"text":"HALF OFF BREAKFAST till 10am!  The menu's a little limited (hence the 4 stars)  but the service was great and the portions were cool.  We had the Miners Breakfast, The Breakfast Sandwich and 2 coffees which came to 11.50. Breakfast on a budget!"}
{"text":"I love it here.  This is our local spot.  It's down the street and ready for us every time we walk through the wide double doors!  It's warm and inviting and there are lots of seats to fill.  Walk and in and take your pick.  There are TV's in every corner you look so sitting anywhere is perfect. 

There are a lot of regulars here..  and the wait staff is super nice and accommodating.  They are quick to come and take care of you when you need and always poppin' up behind you to refill your drinks!
  
Beer selections are awesome... they even have my fave: Linenkeugal!  LOVE.
Regular or LARGE.  Yes... there are options.  The menu is pretty much all bar food.  But not all bars offer good food.  SIERRA GOLD DOES!  

Gilroy Garlic is THE BEST.  They have lots of other goodies.. like the ahi tuna salad, the wings.... etc etc.  but... the Gilroy Garlic always does it for us.  

Looking for a cool local hangout.. this is a good spot to try!

PS: They have a little room called the VIP room I think... that you can reserve for 20.00 and host a little get together for friends during games and just for fun!
I recently reserved it for my husbands 35th birthday during the niner saints game...
We were able to just lounge and chill on the couches watch the game on 3 tv's.  It was a good comfortable time.  


they also have 2 pool tables! - i think you have to reserve them though!"}
{"text":"I stop in here for a beer or a shot once in a while.  It has the typical construction worker following that many mediocre taverns in LV cater to (though I am not one of them).  But on slow days it is sedate, has a full bar, has a lot of floor space, and no noisy obnoxious parents or kids!!!!  Can't  stand em!!!"}
{"text":"Living in this neighborhood on and off for the last twenty years it is always great to have a nice bar/restaurant close by.  The ambience is nice, the food is good, and overall it is a solid bar.  The reason for my low marks is the lack of accessibility to folks in wheelchairs.  The setup made it so I was unable to dine with my parents.  There was ONE table that maybe fit three people that looked like it was pulled out of the garbage that I guess was reserved for folks when they had to deal with a wheelchair.  I don't see how in 2013 so close to an elderly community that, that is even possible."}
{"text":"It's Wednesday night at 8:00pm and this place is jumping. Probably because they have Hapoy Hour from 5-7 with 50% all drinks and pizza's. Filled with all sorts of people. I'm ordering food to go so I sat at the bar. Took the bartender awhike, but she finally saw me. Lots of televisions, 2 pool tables and a fun comfortable area in the back with comfortable seats.  Food order took 30 minites!!! Ordered the steak salad and it was very good"}
{"text":"Terrible service for a late lunch with the hubby... Order was wrong.  Thai peanut wings were bomb.  Tried callin in an order on a Saturday night and was placed on hold for almost 10 minutes!  All I wanted was the Thai peanut wings . Busy or not... Service sucks!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place: the servers remember my name and what I like, the prices aren't too bad, and it's open late. I've been getting salmon teriyaki lately and they remember to cook it very lightly. The risotto they have as a side is a nice touch and isn't too shabby.

Not all is perfect as they don't have much in the way of juice and randomly are closed sometimes. 

A great place to drop in late, have some good food, and chillax."}
{"text":"What an amazing woman,  Andi.  She is so awesome and unique!  She even flies planes!  Andi is a great bartender and has such a fun personality!  Good job PT's,  you have a winner in her."}
{"text":"This place is a great bar to meet friends for happy hour and appetizers. It is huge and has TVs everywhere for sports."}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint. Tonight, after work, all my service lacked because ALL staff was too busy gambling than providing customer service. Good thing this is apart of a chain in which they can stand behind the brand."}
{"text":"Best bar in North Las Vegas. Good place to pregame, drink the night away, or even come after hours. Food is awesome, I love the layout. There a really good chill vibe. Best thing about this place... The bartender HOMER... Check him out. Best in the business. I Love this Bar!!"}
{"text":"This is very nice place for having drinks, nice servicedefinitely come back! Was easy to find,"}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is solid sports bar with that home town locals feel. Atmosphere is great and service at the bar is always great. The bartenders are very attentive and serve great drinks. It's a great place to catch up with friends or catch the games of the day. The apps are amazing and the white pizza is a must try. Open 24 hrs a day and the staff is very friendly. Happy hour with 1/2 price drink specials are also a plus. Fun atmosphere and reasonably priced. Must try if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a joke went there for lunch on 8/28/13 we got a table and sat there for 15 min and no one came over bartender look over a couple of times but still no service was not busy maybe 8 people in this place we got up and left on the way out bartender screams out thank you where do they get these people will never go back."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place but I don't know what happen Saturday night when I went. 

First off, we sat at a table and slowly waiting for our friends to come. We ordered lots of drinks and they were all so weak. One of my whiskey sours tasted only like lemonade and I had to complain. Our server was very nice and attentive. Except the fact later on in the night, one of her nipples were showing! 

Another thing, we ordered Jameson shots chilled. I think they forgot about our shots because it took forever for it to come. After we took them, it seriously tasted like water and Jameson. Gross. 

Now then bartenders could be a little more nicer and help out people that are on the other side of the bar. We were at the bar and it was so hard to flag down a bartender just to cash out! 

Overall, I wasn't pleased and don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The list of wines by the bottle is really outstanding for a typical tavern. I've been here several times for take out and just recently dined in for the first time--each time the service has been great but the food just mediocre at best.  Not horrible, but just not something that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago for the first time for a friend's party, in fact I had never been to any Sierra Gold before...only PT's. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised with how spacious and nice it was. Definitely was not expecting it. There was plenty of table seating and TVs located through out and not only at the bar. It was also pretty cool to see TVs in the bathroom mirrors so you can continue to catch the game and not miss any action!

For the party we had a couple areas reserved for our group and our own waitress as well. The poor waitress was trying to keep up with all our food and drink orders, but overall I think she did a pretty good job despite there being 20-30 of us and only 1 of her. For food we ordered a bunch of appetizers and set it up buffet style for our group to munch on during the party. There were boneless wings (where they apparently serve the sauce on the side?), sliders, fries, and various pizzas. I thought the food was pretty decent for bar food and being able to order them in buckets makes it pretty easy to order in large portions. 

Sierra Gold seems like a pretty chill place to grab a beer and watch sports and it was much less crowded than other sports bars I've been to around town. If only it weren't so far away I would be returning soon to catch some games!"}
{"text":"Just like any Sierra Gold out there...but this one is fanccccyyyy inside. The building used to be a steakhouse, but they renovated it into a bar. Classy and chic with decor of Old Vegas. I love it!

Happy hour deals applies just make sure you have your rewards cards. Depending on who the server is, sometimes service is not that great. Bartenders are a lot more service oriented tho.

I'd come back here just the fact that it's in a nice neighborhood and a very nice establishment.

Don't get raped in the dark parking lot!"}
{"text":"Pizza, pizza, and more pizza. Oh yeah, beer too.

I've never been to Sierra Gold on a non-happy hour. All I know is that it's half off on pizzas and half off on beers. End of story.

Do: Get a black velvet and it goes with your pizza (I usually get the goat cheese, sun dried tomato and artichokes). 
Don't: expect to have a great service. There have been times where the pizzas I want, they didn't have. There have been times where it takes FOREVER AND A HALF to get my orders.

But, a must stop for happy hour."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sierra Gold in quite a while until today where I had a lunch meeting in an upstairs private room.  I must say I was impressed.  I forgot how good this place is relative to other bars.  The service was really good for having a large party.  I had the cheesesteak which is a signature dish and it was the best cheesesteak i've had in Vegas!  It even has good old fashioned cheese wiz!  The fries where great---a little salty!  Net Net this place for the money is great!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend the first night I moved to Vegas. After a 9 hour drive all I wanted was good food and a beer and that's what I got! The waitress who was one of the assistant managers was great, she was attentive and made sure we got anything we needed. The four stars is because the wrap that I ordered was a little watery and a bit too spicy for me to eat all of, but other than that the environment is great."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar in whole Vegas ! Friendly people, amazing bartenders and servers! Verry positive atmosphere with great food  and beer!"}
{"text":"Meet up with some friends here for some drinks and dinner. Even though this place is only 5 min away from my house it was my first time. Cool spot to hang out and chill with friends. 

The service was nicely put, ok. Our server was a little absent and we had to find here on 3 different occasions, just that I remember.  She didn't know what some of the drinks our group ordered were so she had to ask us again, and they were very basic drinks.  

Overall though its a cool 24 hour spot to chill"}
{"text":"After UYEE party for Roy E and I. So we were like keep the good times rolling so decided to keep it close too home. Sierra Gold is just about as close a bar could get minutes away. I never been here but always been fan of the whole PT group of bars. I know they have couple different brands or types between regular PT's, PT's Gold, or the Sierra Gold. Guess each one suppose to be more upscale with the interior decor and the little things. I can say Sierra Gold definitely feels nothing like PT's. I like about it. The moment you walk in the bar area is pretty huge, pretty dark inside with the dark colors of the bar and in general with the interior decor, little sit done dining area on one side walk in, some high table tops around the outside of the bar, and the best feature is little VIP room. We never hung out in. It looks like nice set up. 

If you like sports Sierra Gold keeps the PT's feel for me with tons of wide screens all around! Not bad spot too catch any sports game in the bar. The prices always been fan of the HH drinks and food specials. It definitely not local dive bar feeling cause inside has more upscale feeling for me. It local bar that great spot hang out with friends. One that will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Went to Sierra Gold to watch the game with friends.  Monica was our server, she is the BEST! She took great care of us. Highly recommend this pub. It has a great atmosphere, you can sit at the bar or the dining room and watch the games, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Alright, im jumping back on this finally after having a month full of event s and no time to spare. Darn those family two week visits. 

This review is for two visits to sierra gold. the first was a visit at lunch time on a weekday and th eother is for a sunday night party we had their oct 30th for my husbands birthday. 

The week day visit was okay. service was good. prices a little high for my liking. Nice portion sizes. I love the decor of the bar. Feels very nice compared to other bars in las vegas. The big boothd and chairs are very comfy and cozy. They give off that homie feeling you get when being in the comfort of your own house. 

Our waitress was helpful. explained the menu, daily specials and specials for it being a monday night football day. 

Husband ordered the hot wings and fries. it was a good amount and he loved that it came in a bucket. easy to eat and he said since he had left over he just needed a lid. Awesome. my dish was a make your own burger. It was huge. I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, cheese and grilled onions. Gosh it was so big i had enough for dinner that night. It was a little pricey but after seeing the portion you understand why. 12 bucks, eh i guess i shouldnt complain. 

Took a little long for our food considering it was lunch but i cut them some slack since they were busy. Which is a great sign. 

Our next visit for my husbands birthday gave me mixed exmotions which is why i went with 3 stars. The first visit was easily a 4 but after the horrible service we recieved i knocked it down one more star. 

We paid a 20 dollar deposit to reserve the louge, which i couldn't believe was so cheap. The lougne was exceptional. Large couches, a little bar area to sit and eat your food. 3 TV's. Nice art of beautiful half naked ladies on the wall. The suckie part was, they charged us a butt load for drinks, i couldn't believe how expensive it was. Ive drank for way cheaper on the strip at planet hollywood. We had about 20 people come in a matter of 7 to 8 hours. (we had the invite from 730pm to 230am. It also was bullshit that since we were in the lounge we were not able to get the specials. Not cool. Everyone was drinking left and right, especially ordering drinks for the loud birthday boy. You would think that the waitress would give better service; ordering tons of drinks, some food, etc. No she had a major attitude problem and we had to leave the lounge and walk to her at her other tables to get any attention. it was ridiculous. 

As someone who has worked in customer service for years and years I was highly disappointed. She was constantly making snotty and snippy remarks to our guests. Rolling her eyes. And being difficult.

Our 2nd visit was so bad with customer service that I will not be coming back during the night time service, only for lunch."}
{"text":"I know everyone has their favorites in pizza choices and flavor, but the pizza my friend and I ordered here after a concert evening out, was just plain horrible. In all honesty, Little Caesars $5.00 pizza would have been SOOOO much better! 
We sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  

We went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has. Especially if you're not there for happy hour when they're 50% off, you're paying full price for something that should cost $5-$8 given the size and thickness of the pizza. 

Lackluster.  

Sorry...."}
{"text":"Great service and above average pub food.  They suffer from problems with consistency in their food from shift to shift and restaurant to restaurant.  A real genuine chef created the menu and recipes but I fear this place is missing some of the pub food basics we have come to expect.  I wish Chef Joey would sit down and simplify the choices at all of Golden Gaming places.  In the meantime... better than average.  I recommend the Cheese Steak WITH WIZ!!  Very close to the Philly original."}
{"text":"The first time I came here with my boyfriend, it was really late at night (midnight), so it was pretty quiet.  We ordered the stuffed jalapeños.  If I recall correctly, we only got a few and it was sort of pricey; I don't think we're going to order them again.  The bartender that was working that night was really awesome; he was really friendly and talkative.  He was always checking if we wanted another drink just as we were finishing our current ones.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I decided to give the soju lemon drop a try (I do like soju).  When I downed that, he asked if I wanted another one or if I wanted to try something else.  I didn't know what I wanted, but was open to anything, so the bartender said he'd mix up another soju drink for me.  He said he could make anything.  When he came back with it, it was different, but I liked it.  I forgot if it had a name, but it had some ginger and maybe basil in it.  I forget what else.  He said my second drink was free because I'd been gambling the whole time I was there (didn't lose much. :D).  I don't suppose they do that for everyone, so I thought that was really nice.  I didn't get his name, but he was a stocky guy and I think he had spiked hair. 

01/22/11 Edit: After a recent trip there, my bf said that he's not liking this place so much anymore cuz the last couple of times we were playing video poker and stuff, none of our drinks got comped, but we get them comped at another bar we go to (read further into my review).  Guess it's a more common practice than I previously thought.

Anyway, for our second visit, the female bartender wasn't so friendly.  She wasn't rude or anything, but she just gave us our drinks, the menus, and came back occasionally to check if we needed refills.  It was also a slow night.  I thought she'd be more attentive then, but nope.

The last time we were there, about a week ago, we'd gone on the weekend and it was so busy.  The first two times we were able to sit at the bar, but we had to find a table this time since it was so packed and we even had trouble finding one of those.

I can understand people being short with others if they're stressed or busy, but I've been working in customer service since I started working back in high school and I've never treated anyone like that before, no matter what kind of mood I was in.

The waitress we had seemed like that when she asked for my boyfriend's ID after he ordered a drink.  We dismissed it at first because of the high volume of customers, but I started getting pissed when we waited half an hour for the check.  She just didn't come to our section of the restaurant.  When she did, she spent those five minutes chatting it up with some people in the corner table -- people she knows, I'm guessing.  We probably could've asked one of the bussers or gone up to the bartender or something, but we weren't in a rush and we were very involved in a conversation anyway.  Still, though, we were keeping track of where she WASN'T coming and for how long.  I think she's the same waitress that Tony H. mentioned in his review.  The good thing about this visit was the Cheeto's onion rings.  If you like hot stuff, I recommend you try them cuz they're breaded with Flaming Hot Cheeto's.  Make sure you dip them in the sriracha for the additional heat (it's the thicker sauce; they'll give you a sweet one, too, which is watery, but also good).

The next time (next three times actually) we went out for drinks and food, we went to Five Star Tavern a few blocks south on Aliante and had a much better experience.  (See my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/five-star-tavern-north-las-vegas-2#hrid:Yr1UAjXPkb0HJ3tyz4m-Xw)

Someone else mentioned the architecture in a review (looks like it wasn't here; forgot where I saw it).  I thought it did look pretty neat, but at the same time I thought, WHY would you have the beams that go from the floor to the ceiling also go through the tables (see the picture that someone shared here to see what I mean)?  That's wasted seating right there; they take up enough table space for a person to sit at.  I thought it the first time I went, but since it was so busy during my last visit and there weren't many spots available, I was really wondering why they decided to do that.

An okay experience overall (except that one waitress who hates her life).  The food's pretty good.  On top of the onion rings, we've had the tuna melt panini, caesar chicken wrap, bratwurst, cheeseburger, and chicken fajita -- not all at one time, of course. :P  It was all good."}
{"text":"Been coming here before every Rebel game for years with great service and food.   Been her 4 times in 2 weeks. Same waitress, never remembers us, doesn't check on us and messes up our order. Done, out, finding a new hangout."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to spend a morning watching football. First of all, it is not overcrowded like it is at Buffalo Wild Wings on a Sunday morning. My friends and I arrived at 9:30 am Sunday expecting to fight for a television.  Since we had specific needs- the Cowboys game on 1 television, and the Eagles game on the other, we were unsure if it was going to be possible. 

We set up in a booth that was surrounded by 4 televisions. As soon as the server came over to greet us, I immediately asked if she could accommodate our viewing needs.  Done! In five minutes, we had our games on, and our food ordered.

If you are a proud member of their BEER & BITES club (free to sign up), food is half off before 10:00 am. As a result, I was able to get my Sunday started with a pretty decent breakfast. Scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast for $3.99- YAY!  Oh, and their pizzas are half-off during happy hour- if you are into paper thin crust pizza. I tried the pizza, and thought it was just OK. However, if you drink enough beer- I am sure you will enjoy it.

The atmosphere was laid back, with a private room to watch football if you want to reserve it. They have a few pool tables and a Golden Tee arcade game if you are not into watching football. 

The service was good initially, but tapered off once we ordered our food. It was almost like it was unheard of to order lunch after eating breakfast 3 hours earlier. Prices are good, food is edible, and the vibe is comfortable.

 We will be back-too bad the EAGLES are horrible this year!"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, quaint location.  Service great as usual. Came during lunch hours and wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"$20 for cheese pizza..  Ok I can deal..  But it was so cheap looking the sauce borderline tomato paste and not enough cheese..  The crust was pretty bad too!!  I will never order pizza again from here not even for happy hour"}
{"text":"While we were hanging out watching the games a group of people came up over to our table and told us to move or else they were going to hit us in the face. This all happened out of nowhere. They then began calling us names. When we approached management about the group, they said shut up and that we just needed to separate. We were just minding our own business when the group of people came up out of no where and just started harassing us. Then when we went to pay to get away from these crazy people, it took FOREVER for them to bring us back our card. While waiting the main \"harasser\" came over to say a few more random words while the rest or their group starred at us. So there is an issue that came out of no where, management was made aware, tells us to separate (when we were just sitting there and people came up threatening us) then took forever to allow us to leave because it took forever to pay! Very disappointed with the way this entire situation was handled. I understand that it wasn't managements fault the way the group was acting but they could have done SOMETHING. We won't be coming back. Not our type of crowd and service. I prefer to eat, drink and hangout without being harassed."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food took really long time to get to us. All we ordrered was eggs and pancakes. Pancakes came 15 minutes after the eggs and we're horrible. Not edible! Turned out to be no charge."}
{"text":"This place is new to me!  Had a nice going away gathering for a friend.  I like this joint!  I have been pass this place many times, never stopped by until tonight!  My drink was good."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips which was recommended as a 'best seller' by the server. It was 3 greasy pieces of fish, a couple of very skinny breaded shrimp, a spoonful of cole slaw and a few fries. This meal couldnt even be considered good at a fast food place for a third the price ($11.99).  
Service was fine, nice decor.
Poor Food!"}
{"text":"Came for some dranks on a Saturday night.
Pt's sister bar, they have the same HH so we scored on some half price dranky dranks!
Wanted some munchies and the Garlic Fries caught my eye and the Flamin' Hot Onion Rings. Say whaaaat??!! 
DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!! No wonder these come with three different dipping sauces including sriacha! Its more like food coloring that make these onion rings LOOK like flamin hot awesomeness! There was little flavor to the onion ring itself and ZERO flamin hotness! Not even a HINT of spiciness in fact! These are such a scam! Ugh!!! RIP OFF!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location to get together with some friends and watch football on a Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, the service we received was horrible. No one acknowledged our presence when we walked in and our waitress didn't come to our table until 10 mins after we sat down. The waitress rolled her eyes at us when we ordered, brought out the wrong food and would drop our drinks at the end of the table and walk away. We talked to the manager on duty and unfortunately he was no better. He had no idea how to respond when we voiced our complaints, he stood there and let out a laugh. Food was just ok. If there were football specials, we didn't know about them. An extremely disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here for happy hour. Drinks 50% off. Our server Brittney was awesome! Very friendly staff. Atmosphere is very pleasant. Clean facilities. Good is good."}
{"text":"I'm especially grateful for this bar, not only for the great food.. but for the awesome bartenders  Dawn & Stacy. Very attentive, and entertaining.  And not bad on the eyes.. the machines are AWESOME. . I'm always hitting a 5 spots or 4 of a kind. 3 this night.  Yeahaa!! Will be back! Thank you guys for everything! !"}
{"text":"I'm probably more of a 3.5 with this place, but I decided to give them the 4 since their wait staff was very friendly and very nice to look at! Went to watch a football game with a buddy of mine and down a few beers and eat some garbage that bars call food and was delightfully surprised with their affordable lineup. Beers ran me about 2 bucks a pop for some midlevel crap that I can't remember and the food was cheap and tasty and microwaved to perfection. As for the ambiance this place scores nicely. It has a nice and inviting feel to it and about 11 thousand TV's so your not missing any action. Oh and if the game isn't exciting enough, the waiteresses are a nice distraction as well. Yes I was totally perving out on one of the girls and no I am not sorry about it. To sum it up, cheap beers, cheap food albeit tasty, and great ambiance."}
{"text":"This place actually looks like a very nice bar...but this is a restaurant review!  On that note, the food was completely overpriced and mediocre quality - even for a tavern style place.  I'd go back here to have a drink or shoot pool, but never to eat.  Maybe I'd get a burger if I was starving...how bad can you screw that up.  One more note, their bleu cheese salad dressing was gross."}
{"text":"It's sad that people can sit behind a computer and make false accusations about the individuals who work here when truly the issue is themselves. Every single person that works here works so incredibly hard and they're consistent!! Sierra Gold is PACKED on golden knight game days and the bartenders do an incredible job making sure every single person is helped EQUALLY!! That says something when you walk into a bar and every single game day no matter if it's a weekend, holiday or weekday it's packed! Every customer is welcomed by the bartenders or servers when they walk in, everyone's drinks are constantly filled, plates of food are being delivered and cleaned up immediately! This is definitely not a one-on-one catering bar ESPECIALLY during big sporting events so if you require your shot glass to be filled immediately then maybe somewhere else is better for you to go!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a last minute business meeting on Friday morning around 11:15. When I arrived the place was empty but it must be a pretty popular spot for lunch. By the time my clam chowder arrived at the table this place was starting to fill up. The service was better when we first arrived due to the fact that we had the waiters undivided attention. We weren't exactly neglected after the lunch crowd filed in but it took a little longer to get my water glass refilled. I guess that's to be expected. 

My chowder came out the perfect temperature in a large bowl accompanied by a package of oyster crackers and a bottle of tabasco. All set! Great temp, good presentation, mediocre soup. Ehh, I've had better clam chowder on the salad bar at a buffet. There were lots of large chunks of red skinned potatoes and not much else. It was a hearty serving of chowder but it was mostly filler and only a few small clams. I'm pretty sure I paid $6.99 for a bowl of potato soup masquerading as clam chowder. 

Meal aside, this place gets a 3 star A-OK from me because of the wonderful smoke-free atmosphere. That goes a long way when I pass judgment on a place. Clean air and enforced no smoking is worth a star or two any day."}
{"text":"Half off all breakfast entrees until 10 am!! Their steak and eggs is a solid, post-night out meal. They changed their breakfast potatoes; they're now a little thicker, not so crispy, so I get the fries instead. 

Update: Children are no longer allowed at Sierra Gold because of the liquor laws."}
{"text":"Called the location to ask if we had to make reservations for a group of 8-10 to visit during Happy Hour and bring board games. Was told we did not need a reservation and the woman who I spoke to over the phone recommended the private lounge area so that we could close the curtain to block off the noise and crowds. I thought that was a wonderful suggestion. We confirmed the time my group would be there. This was about 3 weeks out from the date we would arrive.

When our group arrived, the host and other staff had our room ready for us, with water and cups, napkins and silverware/cutlery arranged around the seating area. The private area is nice and cozy-lots of leather oversized chairs mixed with soft ottoman/seats and regular tables in between. We arranged the furniture to accommodate our needs but were sure to return it back to how we found it when we arrived. There is a big fire place at the back of the room as well.

Our drink and food orders were taken right away, and the host was very attentive. Our food was delicious and better than average bar food. Aside from our (HALF PRICED DURING HAPPY HOUR! drinks), we ordered and shared: chicken quesadilla, nachos, fried mozzarella, BBQ Pork potato skins, and artichoke dip. 

We had the room reserved for 2 hours and were actually sad when our time was up. We could have kept playing Cards Against Humanity and talking for much longer than that. We were given our checks, and again the host had no problem with the large group of us each having a check and each having a different method of payment. 

My group and I are already planning our next game night here. Thanks for the amazing service, perfect little venue, reasonable prices, and tasty treats!"}
{"text":"Here to watch a football game with friends. Extremely disappointed to find out that they offer ZERO vegan options with a menu of 50 or so items. I'd expect a chain this large (PTs...) to at least have a few cruelty-free, environmentally conscious options...wait, no- They're all about profit. Hope they wake up soon."}
{"text":"I really thought it was a nice place. Great happy hour as always. The food came out great and I would def go back!"}
{"text":"I love it here. It's my go-to bar. Fajita pizza is great. The staff has always been attentive and nice. I look forward to returning proly this weekend"}
{"text":"I stop here on a regular basis. The bartenders are pretty friendly (can be a hit or miss) They have a good happy hour. 3.50 for a large beer and 1/2 off pizzas. They also have a pretty large menu with good burgers and wings. Its a non smoking bar which is nice. The eating area, gaming area, and restrooms are clean which is a bonus! Ill keep coming back."}
{"text":"Good hang out spot.  Friendly staff and good food.  They have a good happy hour and specials quite frequently."}
{"text":"I have watched most of my Vegas Knights games here. Love Sammie, love Shawn. However there is a woman who likes to bring a My enjoyment crowd down. I am chosen to take friends somewhere else
Go Knights Go.  Would have loved to keep my run here. However she is such a downer. Going to somewhere else to enjoy my Knights. ."}
{"text":"The place is great. The waitress was not hence the loss of 2 stars. We went twice in the last two weeks. The first time the waitress didn't even greet us she just said \"are you drinking anything\". Luckily it was busy and another waitress with an actual personality ended up serving us. She was awesome. Then we went last night with a large group and we had called ahead letting them know. They had a nice area blocked off for us. But...  We got the rude waitress from the week before. She refused to leave menus after we ordered. She literally took a napkin out of my hand to clean up and told me to get another one. Maybe she was obsessive compulsive but she was so rude about it. Not a single person in our party of 10 had a decent experience with her. The saving grace was the gentleman who helped her out delivering the food. He was pleasant and accommodating. For such a nice spot, Sierra Gold should really reconsider allowing the woman server to be around their patrons. They just lost 10 because of her. If you do go beware the server with long brown hair and the absent personality. I recommend sitting at the bar. The bartender and bar back were awesome."}
{"text":"Went in friday the 22nd.  Two of us went to the bar, threw some money in the machines , not busy at all and literally watched the bartenders walk by us 10 times each before we finally flagged one down, and practically begged them to get us a drink.  One kitchen guy actually brought me a chair (the only person that actually acknowledged us or talked to us) because the one was missing). he's the only reason this review even gets one star. Needless to say after finally getting our first drink after 20 minutes we left and will not be back.  Please promote within and get rid of these bartenders with zero personality."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever gotten at a bar! We came for food and drinks to enjoy the hockey game. Server came to get our drinks, I requested lemons for my water FOUR times until the lady gave them to me with attitude (even though I was sweet each time I asked!), she forgot part of my order, and never checked in with us to see how we were doing! When some friends joined us, the two servers kept going back and forth as if neither one of them wanted to help us! Super rude!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food menu but they put it a way that makes it sounds better than it is.  The drinks are poorly made and pricey for what they are.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Service definitely leaves something to be desired here. The bartenders are nice enough, it's not attitudes that are the problem - it's the waiting! Having to ask for the check after we've been done eating almost 45 minutes is annoying. Having to wait an additional 20 minutes to find someone to take my credit card is even more annoying. 

I've been here a couple times on busy Football nights and each time the bar was completely full, but there were people sitting at machines not playing, and I was looking to lose money. That's a pet peeve of mine. If one person is sitting down and four people are hovering around them and you're just sitting at a machine but not playing/not planning to, have some decency to move over. 

The food is pretty good, not as greasy as most bar foods, but typical PT's/Sierra Gold fare. This place is pretty big. One night we walked in and found a group playing Yahtzee in the corner at a table - those people were awesome.

One note, and maybe this shouldn't surprise me but it's never been a problem before - apparently it's not OK to smoke clove cigarettes at this bar. While I was losing money at a machine, my friend was smoking and there was no problem. We move down after we're done playing and all of the sudden the bartender tells us she has to take her cigarettes outside because they \"bother people.\" Umm... ok?"}
{"text":"The place was clean, service was friendly and timely when I went on a Thursday evening but they were pretty busy so I can only imagine how busy they can get on a weekend. The wings and fries were cooked just right but the nachos were stale. Overall its a cool place to hang."}
{"text":"My favorite bar, the food is awesome and the bar tenders are friendly. Especially Samantha, she has a winning smile and is beautiful. She is fast with the drinks, and the food. Awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"So far so good..atmosphere very nice.
food not so much.. it came out cold and the cheeto onion rings tasted awful..........uggh I will try again for breakfast but not lunch ... it is funny we were the only people eating there and still the food was cold"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, said hi when we walked in the door and were pretty quick on the service. However, I'm HIGHLY disappointed in their comp system with drinks. My friend played max bet video poker, put in 25 bucks they comped one beer. She asked for another drink and the waitress said...\"what have you put in the machine?\" my jaw dropped. Then she comes with a tab and charged her for the drink. SERIOUSLY?! Keep in mind she was still playing. She cashed out and we left. Never in my life am I going back to this place!"}
{"text":"this place is one of my favorite bars nearby! the bartender homer is awesome! if this is your first time there and homer's the bartender, you're in some awesome hands! he's so attentive and knows so much about alcohol. don't know what you want to drink or want to try something new? don't worry! he'll be able to help you figure it out. 

we always go here for happy hour so the pizzas and drinks are half off, which is always a great thing :) my favorite pizzas are the gilroy and the hunters. they also have really good chili cheese fries or tots! 

the bar is also really nice looking. it's not one of those dingy dark looking bars. definitely a good spot to just hang out and chill in."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch Saturday afternoon. Place wasn't super busy, maybe 3 -4 tables when we got there plus 6 or so at the bar. Food was good. It is nice to have a good bar food place close. We decided to just do apps and ordered the beef sliders, boneless wings medium and pork loaded potato skins. The skins and sliders were excellent. The wings were OK. A little hard. As we sat a few more couple came in. The waitress was very friendly but extremely swamped. It was just her and a bartender. They clearly needed at least one more server. She never stopped moving. Probably would have given 3 1/2 starts if i could but couldn't get to that 4th yet. we will be back to try again. I have a feeling with a few minor adjustments that 4th star will come."}
{"text":"I love dropping (losing) $200 in a bar video poker machine, ordering food and not even getting my soda comped. It's just great business practice. I fully expected to pay for my food, but you couldn't float me the soda? Noted. The tuna appetizer is divine. The pizzas are great (but only worth it at half price.) I guess dealing with more than their fair share of drunks can get to be annoying, but the attitudes in there could use some adjustment. The frosty beer glasses are a nice touch."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over a year now for Saturday/Sunday breakfast and we love it! Trista is always our waitress and she is so happy and positive evertime we come in; and she remembers how we love our bloody marys. I love the atmosphere and the staff are all so nice! The breakfast is good and the price cant be beat! I usually stick with the sierra gold platter and get the ham steak, its thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly! We will continue to come back!!!"}
{"text":"tldr

Look for my homies Homer and Christy, super chill vibe, great ambiance

Get:
-half off pizzas (fajita pizza and BBQ chicken)"}
{"text":"Go See HOMER he is the best bar tender in north Las vegas.   Dont bother going on any other shift.   Unless you want horrible service and bad attitude from the wait staff."}
{"text":"The last two weeks, the bloody marys were exceptional...this week they decided to forego the good mix and compensate with water?  Not sure, but aweful.  Took forever to get a drink and now no one has checked back for food or anything...been easily 20 minutes.  They also don't understand their satellite system and keep changing the channels to the incorrect games...thats annoying enough, then add the dumb patrons bitching about it. 

I'll just go home and make bloodys...if anyone knows of a good spot to watch football and have some good bloodus, put it on here.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this is a PTs property. This place is a thousand times better than PTs. One of my favorite place to get drinks and hang out would have to be right here. The customer service is great; Food was alright. Tried the quesadilla... not too shabby. Bartenders are always available and don't ignore you unlike PTs, someone can take your drink order and you'll have it within 2 minutes. I really like their fast service and the fact that they actually care for their customers."}
{"text":"This review is for the meat-lover's pizza.  Servpro (frozen pizza) crust, doesn't look like much effort went into this.  For $22 retail 16\", it's not worth the expense.  Napoli is just half a block away and at least that's hand-thrown for cheaper.  
Glad I paid $11 for happy hour - I would have been very unhappy at $22.  
F&B- at least a Freshetta or CPK would be an upgrade for about the same wholesale cost."}
{"text":"Hello old friend! We have not been here in years. Our loss. The BEST sushi I have had in a long time. The service is amazing. We won't wait so long for our next visit!"}
{"text":"this place is outstanding! i've been to mango's, the old legends casino, pt's on decatur and village pub in desert shores which \"used to\" be my favorite...til last night! the staff is friendly, the food is good and the place is very very nice on the inside! it isn't your typical bar, it has more of an upscale feel to it. the bartender brandie was the most attentive informative i have had in my history of drinking. And about a previous review I saw of Sierra Gold in concerns to comp drinks, I understand the concepts of comping drinks in Vegas but this isn't that day and age anymore. They still do that at the nickle slots at fiesta, hit that up! anyways, I don't mind paying happy hour prices or full price as long as the service is good. and the service here is great! big thanks to brandie for great food recommendations and making sure my drinks were bottomless! i will tell my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar. A little more upscale than you Pt's with a great atomosphere and terrific food selections 24/7"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about the flagship version of Pt's. It's easily my favorite local bar. With there being one Sierra Gold in Henderson I've only been here a few times and have enjoyed myself each time. A+ establishment"}
{"text":"So when a co-worker said that we should come here, I had first thought that we were visiting an adult star for lunch.  I mean, what sort of weird name is that?

However when we pulled up, it was a pub.  Yeap.  Greasy pub food. Yum.

Two things that bothered me though.  The first was that it seemed like the music was turned up pretty loud.  Understandably, it is a pub, but at one point, someone decided to jack with the sound system and turn it up even more annoyingly loud.  To the point where you had to yell to hear anyone speaking.

That was alleviated finally after someone fixed it, but it was interesting that someone wanted to mess with the sound volume in the first place when most of the people in there were your normal business lunch crowd.

The other was the fact that the waitress didn't even bother to check if my credit card was even in the payment jacket thingiemajiggy.  I literally was looking all around and was about to have a melt down until one of my co-workers spotted my lonely card on the floor.

I mean, I know I'm good lookin' but really now... I didn't think that waitress wanted me for my card that bad.... or... so I had thought.

In any case, the ordered french dip that came with au jus, and horseradish sauce (you know, horseradish + sour cream) was delish.  Everything seemed okay except the issues above.  Now whether or not future visits will have the same results remains to be seen.

But watch out, Sierra Gold waitresses.  Sorry, I'm taken."}
{"text":"They have a good selection on the menu to choose from. 

My coworker and I went to this place and he ordered BBQ chicken pizza. He recommended it because apparently when he had it the last time (about a week or so ago), he said it was BOMB!  The pizza came and my first thought was, \"wow, that smells like BBQ\".. and as it got closer, the BBQ smell was just fumigating. Well, the pizza was a thin crust flat pizza and had red onion and pieces o white chicken meat and had mozzarella cheese on it. It was simple enough, but they over did it on the BBQ sauce. 

Would I go back? Yea, I went here before and had their chicken pesto panini and that was BOMB!

Perhaps the next time i try that BBQ pizza I'll make sure they go easy on the BBQ sauce =P.. 

The place is nice BTW, plenty of room for big crowd or small crowd. They even have a private lounge area section I guess if you're interested in throwing parties or what not..  It's very nice.. =)"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, most of my friends think I am a borderline scumbag going to a gambling establishment for breakfast. Thankfully, I live in Vegas now and this is quite a frequent occurrence. Sierra Gold is our go-to for breakfast and a few drinks after a long night at work.

The bartenders are great. Friendly, attentive and they make me smile in the morning before a 6:00AM flight. What makes me smile even more? Gluten Free Crispin cider ON TAP. Only $7 for a large pint to start the day? Yes please! Forget the calories, give me the cider, which, by the way, tastes amazing on tap. Let's get to the food, because other than gambling away my funds, that's what we come here to do.

Specials: 1/2 off breakfast from 6:00AM-10:00AM with players card. I would still pay full price for the breakfast though, but moving on.

Pizza: I haven't eaten the pizza, but friends and my fiance have, and it was pretty good for Vegas pizza. Yes, we are pizza snobs coming from a city that prides their pizza as the best pie in the country. Go to Gino's East and you'll understand...or Pizzeria Uno...maybe even Lou Malnati's. I digress. Get the pizza at Sierra Gold topped with meats and veggies and you'll be good to go.

Breakfast. Oh the omelets. I had to go here twice in a row one week because I found my happy omelet with bacon, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. Perfect amount of cheese, not like the Omelet House that makes my arteries scream for lean proteins. Perfect amount of guacamole and crispy, crispy bacon. I have a pet peeve about restaurant bacon. Crispy or go home. Sierra Gold did it just right.  My fiance get's the Miner's Breakfast which is sausage, peppers, breakfast potatoes, ham, onions, bacon and more, topped with delicious eggs and cheddar cheese. My fiance does not like scrambled eggs but eats these scrambled eggs in a heartbeat. The sourdough bread looks incredible. Big thick slices, toasted perfectly. You can also get wheat, rye and white. Excellent choices. One issue with the breakfast? The breakfast potatoes are nothing to write home to Mom about. They're fine, just nothing as good as the omelet. They need some seasoning, maybe the seasoning they put on their twister fries?

Go to Sierra Gold if you're in the area. Specials in the morning for breakfast, 1/2 off food and drinks at night too after 12:00AM, oh, and a happy hour in the middle of the day as well. That makes the draft domestic beer 25 ounce large glasses $2.25. Yeah. Worth it on all accounts, and hey, it is pristinely clean and TV'S IN THE MIRRORS IN THE BATHROOM. Hey, it's all about the small things my friends."}
{"text":"Easily the worst bar in Las Vegas, I get it that sometimes people have bad days but not a whole staff. We were told around 25 minutes after we ordered that they were out of the items we ordered. Instead of being polite about it, we were treated like an inconvenience for ordering something that was on the menu. We decided to not replace the missing food items and just roll with it, after waiting another 20 minutes for the bartender to ask if we decided what we wanted. I only had the chance to order one beer because my glass must have had a radioactive material on it that was poisonous to bartenders at Sierra Gold. Most certainly will never be back, I really hope you never ever ever give them the chance to ruin your night."}
{"text":"I love this place. Both bartenders (Christy and Christy) at Friday night are the best. The food is awesome and half price on happy hour and then happy hour breakfast which is also fantastic. This is by far one of the best bars/taverns in town. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is like that girl you're great friends with in high school but that you dont realize you actually loved until you've both gone on to college.  When i first moved to Vegas, I went to Sierra Gold all the time.  It was a great spot to watch a game, grab a bite and have a beer.  It was, simply put, another sports bar.

But then a new place came into my life.  It was an intense affair, but it wasnt built on love...just really cheap drinks.  My heart yearned for something, a missing element.  I realized Sierra Gold is what it desired and I have gone back to claim my love.  

In my haste for the \"Hot, new chick\" on campus, I neglected to see that the staff at Sierra Gold was always friendly, the food always reliable and the beer always plentiful and cold. 

Highlights of our relationship include the Footlong Philly Cheese-steak Hot Dog, the Jumbo Pretzel, the Chicken Tenders and a really good breakfast menu (for a bar).  

Im glad she took me back because there is no other place I want to be.   Now you might be asking why I gave a 4 stars to my love...well its just a sports bar after all.  Ive got to save the 5's for those places I dont get to go all the time...much like a Victoria's Secret model compared to your wife."}
{"text":"This place is minutes from my house, and is one of my favorite non-casino establishments in Las Vegas (yes they have Video Poker but who doesn't).

Sierra Gold is a member of the Golden Gaming Family (which also includes PT's) so they do arguably one of the best happy hours in town twice a day. From 3p-7p and 12a-4a they have half priced Pizzas and Drinks...not just drafts or wells, all drinks in the house are half price.

I really like the vibe here, it has a laid back lodge/bar feel, and a top notch menu. I almost always end up with The Hunter's Pizza,  which never disappoints.

There are really only 2 complaints I have about  Sierra Gold

1 on the weekends it can get a little crowded, but it's usually not too bad

#2 it's not across the street from my house"}
{"text":"Went to Sierra Gold this Saturday afternoon to start off a bachelor party. We paid a fee to have a section to ourselves. But it was still in the middle of the bar, but we did have our own waitress which was nice. Tho, something tells me it was her first day waiting. Upon my arrival I attempted to order a \"bucket of beers\", but not only does this place not offer that kind of deal, but our waitress had never heard of such a delivery system for beer, which I found odd. She almost acted as if I had made it up. 

Regardless, they had very cheap, very large beers. For dinner I got the seared ahi salad, it was really good and it didn't overly fill me up  like bar food would have. With everything I got, 5 huge beers and the salad, it was just over $30 bucks, so I was very pleased. 

We left for a while and came back for some drunk food and beers. I ordered a pizza and curly fries, the pizza was shitty and I ended up giving half it to my cab driver on my ride home. The fries were great. I would gladly come back, it's far from downtown where I live, so I have a $40 cab ride if I want to drink all night again, but I can see myself doing that once a month. 

They lost a star for serving Pepsi products!"}
{"text":"1:40 am on a Thursday and per usual the bar is full yet not one person gambling, it reeks of cigarettes (which it's a bar.....I get it) but for some reason again AS USUAL the place is as humid as an old deep south baptist church with no AC. I love the staff here but I'm tired of walking into this place just to walk out for the same reason. See ya around Sierra Gold."}
{"text":"Come for the happy hour and man is it nice!  We are able to walk to this establishment so that makes it real nice.  Great service with pretty good happy hour food make this a real bargain.  Me and the wife had the pizza with a few extra toppings and several cold ones and with a generous tip still came out under 50 bucks.  Nice place and great service really made this a pleasant night out.  Try it out! Hope you enjoy and hope this review helps you out."}
{"text":"Wow. The place is pretty, but don't expect \"high end\" as they tout on their website.  It's basically Timbers with much better atmosphere. 
We joked from the start that our waitress hated us but it became clear that it wasn't a joke, she actually did hate us, or maybe just her job. We're pretty happy go-lucky so we can handle a hard attitude; she reminded me of my BFF, I actually texted my BFF and said she should never be a server Lol We laughed it off, we weren't here for her company anyway. 
To bad the food was terrible. We had the potstickers (which were the best dish despite being a bit on the spicy side), artichoke dip (excited to see it come w crostini but surprisingly the chips were way better than the bread. The dip itself was so-so), and I had the fish and chips which were very bland (but the fish was better the next day in the toaster), I hardly touched the tastless fries which was a big part of why I ordered fish n chips to begin with. 
Then we made the huge mistake of ordering dessert.  We wanted it to-go but were told we couldn't get 2 (out of 3) desserts to-go due to the fact they are served in Mason jars. This is crazy to me. I get it, it's hipster cool, but I've had other restaurants that do it that way know how to send their creations to-go. I asked if they could just pour it into a to-go container and that I wouldn't hold it against the chef (I mean, it couldn't be worse than dinner, right?) So we ordered the chocolate cream pie and chocolate chip cookies.  We had already paid our bill and were just waiting on desserts. After 10 minutes our server walked by and said \"Have a good night\", we reminded her we were waiting on dessert, \"Oh right, let me go check on that\". She came back and told us the cookies are baked to order so they take a bit (anyone whos ever baked cookies knows they take 12 mins tops. And anyone whos ever worked in a restaurant that had a made-to-order dessert also knows to mention the wait time to the customer at some point!)
After 20 minutes SO tried to get her attention to ask about dessert to which she snapped back (across the section) \"Sir, the.cookies.are.made.to.order!\"
After 30 minutes we got our desserts. 
The chocolate \"cream\" pie is pudding (with whipped cream and crumbled grahams). Although, the kitchen did know how to make it to go, very nicely packaged in a soup container. The chocolate chip cookies were good, 4 thin cookies fresh from the oven (probably take about 7 minutes to bake).

$80 for 2 beers, 3 apps, 1 main, 2 desserts.
Unreal.
Better off throwing another $30 to that and going to The Melting Pot for a fine dining experience where the staff treat you well and the Chef aims to please."}
{"text":"Service isn't too slow but not quick either. Sucks that you can order one drink at a time  for happy hour but then it isn't a PTs pub. Huge and nice though."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Bartenders didn't even acknowledge us and we had to wait forever to get a drink. I finished my drink before Happy Hour was over at 2am and was ready for another but couldn't get one. Finally got one and was charged full price. Pathetic, won't go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, casual, upscale atmosphere, delicious pizzas for the price.  Tried the Hunter's special & Buffalo Ranch on Monday Night Football.

Come in between 5 - 7 PM or 12 - 2 AM for happy hour. 50% off pizzas & drinks. 5 star service. Our Waitress was cool, I forget her name though.. Dark hair,  tats & tan.  Total sweetheart made sure all the drinks were full."}
{"text":"Never been here? Well...just imagine a PT's Pub that Ty Pennington just threw up on! Oh yeah...it's a PT's Pub with an Extreme Makeover Home Style Edition written all over it. I ventured over to this bar with a group of friends to watch a little Sunday Night Football and AL Playoff action. I was quite surprised when I entered. A very classy watering hole for locals who are looking to chill and having a good time amongst friends. Decor was great.....very modern and inviting. 

My group and I sat down and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress whose service was impeccable throughout the entire night. Always in the nick of time when our glasses were empty,  she was right there to take our order. The food....I must say... was some of the greatest bar food I have had in a long time. The wings, nachos and fried ravioli were delectable!!  Sierra Gold will definitely see my face more often now that I have experienced it!!"}
{"text":"I love it here. My god, I think I inhaled my food. It's a great place to come to eat after you've been drinking or perhaps, WHILE you are drinking. My only wish is that they had more food options on the happy hour menu. That would make this place over the top. 

The service was great! I should have caught her name but our waitress was very attentive to our needs and had a great smile on her face despite it being late at night.

Our order: 2 yummy blue moons, loaded tator tots, chicken and mushroom pizza, and garlic Parmesan wings. 

What a freakin' meal! It was the perfect bar meal ever! Wait, I should mention that I didn't really enjoy the chicken/mushroom pizza but well, the other 2 made up for it. The tator tots were so crunchy even after being attacked by the sour cream. The bacon. The cheese. The green onions. OHHHHH MY GOODDD. I loved it. Can you not tell?

And those wings. Man, I love wingstop.. but geez, these ones have topped them. They were crunchy and had a light garlic taste. Dip that in ranch and bam! Explosion of flavor!

I was seriously full but I NEEDED to finish the food. I washed it all down with a large pint of blue moon and called it a night.

Sierra gold's tator tots should be worth it's weight in GOLD!"}
{"text":"Nestled close to a major freeway and major roadway.. perfect for intoxicated people to drive home on. Seriously this place is always busy.. sometimes tooooooo busy, it seems to be a local hangout of for \"trendy\" crowds. The food is decent and who doesnt love beer? The location is well planned and the enterior is nice. I would come here more often if there wasnt 100 bars closer to my pad."}
{"text":"FANCY FOR A PT

I would have to say this \"PT\" SIERRA GOLD is lit up pretty well & just looks more spacious & fancier aahahaha friends love to come to this location when they come from Cali because it's the center point in a sense... 

Staff here are nice but it does take hella long time for a cocktail waitress to come around if you ain't sitting on the bar top where the bartender would normally get to you pretty quickly. 

Food is bar food so you can't expect too much but I was disappointed to find out that the Gilroy pizza here is WAYYY different from.what I'm used to from all other PT locations but I guess since this is sierra gold, they need to be different...

One of my friends got this crazy ass sandwich which I do not recall the name of but if you read through the menu it lists a whole bunch of meats in one sandwich & that's the one."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place! If you're going here for happy hour, pay VERY close attention to how many drinks you have vs how many they charge you for. This is the THIRD and last time I will ever step foot in here! My co workers go here quite often and I have met them now three times. The first time, my friend and I combined out tabs and were charged for 13 vodkas when we knew damn well we didn't have that many, but we paid and went on our way. Second time, same thing. Friday, we went again and counted our drinks. We each had 3! Hold many were we charged for???? 10!!! Of course we said something and the waitress knew she was busted! I won't be back! Not a good look at all Sierra Gold! You lost a crowd of business from us! None of us will ever be back. The only reason I gave you one star was because I had to! Keep ripping people off!"}
{"text":"Attempted to call to place an order for pick up. Double Cajun Wings with curly fries.
 Called for 25 minutes with no answer. Admittedly I did start calling 10 till happy hour closes, 1:50 a.m. Felt they were busy putting in orders, thats fine, but 10 to 15 minutes after happy hour ends? 

Entered S.G., asked if their phone number changed or something. Bartender responded, \"we dont answer phones when we're busy\".  

Not, \"sorry we missed you, what can i get for you\", nope just, \"we dont answer phones when there are more than 2 people at the bar\".

To clairify, no one at the bar was ordering drinks or closing out, everyone was chillin', i was promptly greeted and order was taken within 1 minute of entering. They werent busy, dude just didnt want to answer the ****ing phone. 

Additionally, double cajun wings implies twice the amount of cajun seasoning. I mean its written that way on their menu. This is twice i've ordered and gotten plain wings that accidentally got cajun seasoning on them. It would be akin to ordering a bacon cheeseburger and someone just rubbed bacon on the patty and called it a day.
 
Attempted, to call to notify the restraunt of the lack of seasoning but alas no one ****ing answered.

Note the small patch of seasoning in fig. 1"}
{"text":"Typical local bar, but I'd say it's nicer than most. The drinks are cold and food is descent. The pizzas are pretty good, and even better during happy hour. The wings are good as well. Nice spot to hangout after work."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  I've eaten here numerous times and ordered the chicken Cesar salad and it came with breaded chicken; this time it came with grilled.  No big deal right?  Oh but wait, when I asked the waitress Lisa she insisted that hey NEVER make it with breaded chicken and walked away.  As I was on my lunch so I didn't have a lot of time, so I thought to myself I'd just order a small side of chicken tenders......but when I \"inconvenienced\" this waitress by asking for a small order she said that the smallest she could do was the lunch portion, which I didn't want to pay another 10 for.  So after looking blankly at me for a second she said \"well?\" And I said nevermind, then she walked away.  Very disappointed with this place and would not recommend others coming here."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. TV's everywhere so you can see the games and the food is great. Take some friends and make it a hangout."}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  They had great service. We had someone greet us from the bar as soon as we walked in.  They also have great food.  Their pretzel bites appetizer is amazing.  The happy hour specials were also a great deal.  If you are in the neighborhood, definitely check them out."}
{"text":"The food is good and the menu has a lot of choices.  It is just very smoky in there.  I realize it's a pub and cigarette smoke is normal, but it's hard to eat in there with all of it.  And the service is not always great.  It is convenient to my job, so I get food to go from there quite a bit.  However, it's no place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I came in today parched! My server Tannie immediately welcomed me at the door and took me to my seat. She was the friendliest, happiest and prettiest server I've ever had! I ordered the Gilroy pizza it was delicious!! After eating I decided to gamble and the bartender Dawn was extremely cheerful and sweet! I love the vibe of this place and their awesome staff, best local spot in Vegas... 

Thanks Sierra Gold!!!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends for the first time.  The bartenders are great from the swing to graveyard.  The crowd is a mix.  Some people go there for the food, some for the sports, but I went for the drinks.  They have a nice selection.  Pizza was great.  They even have a nice lounge area in the back with a huge flat screen.  Only reason I have four stars is because they didn't have a pool table."}
{"text":"If you haven't been before, Sierra Gold is a upscale version of the PT's you find everywhere else in the valley. There are a couple locations around town but each spot is a pretty consistent experience.

The first thing you will notice about Sierra Gold is that the place is huge. There is a massive bar along with several dining tables and high tops to accommodate a party of any size. Plenty of TVs around the walls and even in the bathroom mirrors make it a great place to catch the game. 

SG gets extra points for the fact that you can reserve out a little spot for a small party all to yourselves. I came in with a group of around 25 people and it was great to have our own area sectioned off with appetizers and assigned servers. The pub is also a bit more upscale that your average PTs but still has the same prices and specials. It does get busy during happy hour (5-7pm and 12-2am) especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"The happy hour at Sierra Gold is what makes this place worth the outting.

Sierra Gold can best be describes as a high-end PT's and it really is. PT's own all of the Sierra Golds (I think there are a total of 3 of 4 in Las Vegas) and really positions SG as the chains more fancy or nicer bars. 

This particular location is located right off the 215 on the SW side of town. Its easily 5 times the size of a traditional neighborhood bar complete with an upstairs private room which can be rented for special occasions. 

The main reason that I and really any of my friends come by is for the cheap drinks and pizza during happy hour. The late night happy hour which starts at 12am every night takes half off all the drinks and the pizza at SG. This makes SG the perfect place for a late-night excursion or cheap eat after a night of going out. Like most bars, the regular price drinks fun anywhere from 6-10 bucks, which turns into $3-5 during HH! Thats awesome! On top of that they are a pretty good selection of beers on tap along with some great specialty drinks.

What brings in a lot of people of course is the food. The pizzas are also 50% off during happy hour and they are worth it. The thin crispy pizzas pair pretty well with any late night munchies you get. They have enough combinations of toppings and sauces to satisfy even the pickiest of pizza eaters. I wish they had other foods on the happy hour because pizza is not really up everyone's alley.

The only downside I have noticed to SG is their abysmal service when the place gets busy. Come in on a weekend night and it you have to go search for a server to bring you drink and food. I understand that because of the discounts, the servers don't make as much and probably don't want to work as hard, but that is still no excuse for poor service.

All in all its a great place to check our if your looking for cheap drinks and food."}
{"text":"For all the times I have been here I can't believe I haven't gotten around to reviewing SG.

In a nutshell Sierra Gold is a bigger nicer version of PTs. The food, drinks, and prices are essentially the same. Complete with pool tables, a lounge, and even a upstairs event room, Sierra Gold is everything you have come to expect from a PTs and more. 

To be honest the only time I set foot in here is for happy hour. 50% off all drinks and pizzas from 5pm - 7pm and 12am - 2am. In fact this probably the only reason anyone I know comes here. With the HH, drinks actually become reasonably priced: $3.75 for the big mugs, and $2.50 for the small. The pizzas are decent; the Gilroy with it's white sauce, mushrooms and pepperoni is a favorite and you can't go wrong with the BBQ chicken. . 

Service varies depending on when you come. During the day the place is barren, but show up on a weekend night around 12 and you will be hard pressed to find a server. Location is perfect, right off the 215 on the southwest side of town. Overall Sierra Gold has been a great spot for grabbing drinks and meeting up with friends as long as you come during the right times."}
{"text":"Great place for wings, chili bowl, burgers. The bar staff is amazing. They stay on top of all their customers even when the bar is full. Great atmosphere. Everyone seems to be having fun. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. Good place to come for football."}
{"text":"This is MY bar. Emphasis on MY not to seem territorial, but more to say that this is my go-to bar. You know da kine where everybody knows your name, your drink order and such. And I don't think I come here that often so that means they do pay attention.

My friend and I always meet here when it's time to have a few drinks and catch up. We used to switch it up from time to time with some of the other bars in NLV but none of them have better food or HH specials. Now we just exclusively come here for drinks on our usual WCW (West Coast Wednesday's), which is what we call our little humpday ritual for the past few years now. Hehe corny, I know.

They have monthly food specials so if you ever get bored with the regular menu (impossible) try one of the featured foods they have for that month. 

Some of my faves:

Pretzel bites
Turkey Panini (add bacon and tomato)
Steak and eggs
Cajun (dry rub) chicken wings
CooCoo chips
Caesar Salad (w/med rare steak)
Any of their burgers
P90 margarita (which is more like a margatini)

I know I'm forgetting to mention a few things but honestly, I have not had anything I disliked from there. Come check 'em out if you're up here. Maybe I'll see you next WCW."}
{"text":"Tightest slots in Vegas. Great Nachos. Avoid the place if your a gamer. Never won in the place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this particular Sierra Gold location for about 3 years now and I've always had good experiences. The bar staff is friendly, and love to engage in sports talk with their customers. The place is an upscale version of PTs all over the valley. I particularly like the fact that they have TVs all over the place, so they can show all of the games at once. They have additional rooms that can be reserved for viewing parties, and they'll even put the sound of your game on if you're an early requestor. They run specials on the food, usually super early in the morning at 6 am. The food however, tastes a little under par; I've always really liked the variety of wings they have but most of the other menu items for some reason don't quite carry the flavor of other establishments. If I was going to primarily eat food, then I'd rather choose other establishments around town.

All in all, I like coming here because of the staff. The beer is reasonably priced, and you'll never have any trouble finding any of the games you're trying to see; especially since they have TVs imbedded in the mirrors in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We finally got to eat here. My sister didn't want fast food we ended up here last night. This is going to be our new spot. Service was great! People were coming in and out as we were here. Popular spot for people to have good grub with family and friends."}
{"text":"First time a few weeks ago. Had the big boy burger....damn chicken fingers, burger patty, fried mozzarella cheese patty, and fixins....ridiculous. BBQ sauce made it a little sweet would probably get without next time but overall nice gut buster."}
{"text":"We do Beer Thursdays after work at Sierra Gold.  Fun atmosphere, great food (hint: try the Gilroy with RED sauce...yum!)  Pretty much all the seats in the place have a good view of a nearby TV screen so you won't miss a second of the game."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! The bartenders are so not friendly they seriously made me not so end any money there. I was coming to hang with friends and drink but after the first 2 the service killed it for me. If you have a table of 20 why the he'll would you lie and say you were leaving and need to close our tab. Then think we are so blind we see you there 2 hours later. Really?? Then The Rest Of The Night Not One Person Came To Ask If We Needed Anything. Worst service ever. Oh and the bartender couldn't even get my drink right. She acted like she was doing me a favor."}
{"text":"...What can I even say about my experience here. I came here with a girlfriend to catch up,on life and it was one wrong thing after the other. I ordered a ciroc and soda and wasn't quite sure what I received. The clear cocktail in front of me was extremely sweet. When I finally got the attention from the \"inappropriate for her size\" sleazy dressed bartender I told her I had the wrong drink. She remade it and it still tasted the exact same. Extremely sweet. I sent it back and made sure she understood REGULAR ciroc vodka, with club soda. She came back and yet again. It was still sweet. My girlfriend tried it and told me it had to be peach flavored vodka. When I told the bartender she tasted it and said someone had to of \"married\" the wrong bottles together. Now I come from a long history of working in bars and I know for a fact that pouring 1 bottle of liquor into another bottle is totally against the law.

With lack of better judgement we ordered food. I had the steak fajitas, I specifically asked for no dairy considering I'm allergic to lactose. When my fajitas arrived they were smoothered in sour cream. The bartender then told me she didn't know sour cream was dairy. Smh. I paid my bill and we left right away. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Good excellent.  Really good!!!! Worth every penny. Great value. One of those places you can come and have a good meal and great beer. Little gem off the strip."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, I am a regular PTs player and James at Sierra Golds on 215/Jones had the nerve to say I was complaining about a $40 check when I told him he charged me for my drinks. Not only did I lose a bet because of their filthy machines, when the machine didn't hold and I lost, I asked him to call a tech and he complained saying it would take two hours for them to come out. HORRIBLE!!! you never know who will walk in to your bar!! I would hate to know my servers or bartenders left such a bad impression of our brand in a customers memory. I will never step foot inside Sierra Golds!! GO TO PTS GOLD ON BUFFALO/215 instead SAME HAPPY HOUR AND BETTER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Luckey and Sam make this the best PT's family bar in the Valley by far! Service is fantastic! The food is great and your beer is never empty!! I drive from Red Rock here ... past SG (overpriced shit service) and 6 or 8 PT's for the real deal !! 10 out of 10 !!"}
{"text":"Decent place. The servers are friendly enough and the food isn't bad. It's kinda roomy inside and they have a cool outdoor patio with sofas and stuff. The pizza is made in a thin crust style and is better than you'd find at most casual bars but certainly doesn't compare to a quality pizza joint. The wings aren't bad, better than BWW. The beer prices from what I remember are pretty fair. They have a fair selection of beers on tap but its not enough to satisfy the curiosity of a beer snob like me. I don't have strong feelings about this place one way or the other-- its a decent place to hang out in the day or for a monday night football game, but I don't suggest it for special occasions or dates."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service today!  The food while not a 5 * it was great for happy hour.  Happy hour is 1/2price drinks and pizza!  Great deal but the pizza is a little skimpy on toppings"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good here..... But the wait staff can be really hard to find.... Waited for 20 min for someone to get us our bill and the location was empty.... Sadly it's been this way  for years.... Not sure why I keep coming back.... Must be a syndrome or something..."}
{"text":"Before the review, I have to admit that I have an automatic dislike for establishments such as this. I don't go to sports bars, don't watch ESPN or Fox News and don't fancy having to choose from a menu that promises cardiovascular disease.  Lunch for me involves conversation, delicate food and pleasant service. 

None of this was achieved today at lunch at Sierra Gold. Suffice to say I didn't have a say in the lunch choice. 

I ordered the Pear & Arugula Salad ($10). The pears were very strange. They seemed to have been soaked in a marinade for a very long time and were soggy and tasted quite offensive. The portion of salad was enormous with a generous heaping of fresh arugula as well as candied pecans. The dressing was very average and the star of this dish was the 3 fried onion strings that they threw on the top. Yes three. I count this as one of the top five worst meals of my life. 

The service here was very lukewarm. No one on the waitstaff really wanted to be there. Our orders were taken right and the drinks were filled.

I've been here before and had the Garden Vegetable Pizza which was just slightly better than this salad. 

Since I'm already looking towards the future in trepidation of my next trip to this joint, I'm going to have to give this place 2 stars. 

1 star for the convenient location off 215 and 1star for forcing me to diet today with the abysmal meal I had.  

Man, am I glad I didn't have to pay for this meal."}
{"text":"Got the chicken fingers and coo coo fries...bomb! The only thing I don't understand is why you only get a 1 ounce ranch cup for 4 huge chicken fingers. So you have to pay .50 for another.  The service was good. The bartender was friendly. My hubby said the men's bathroom was filthy and out of toilet paper."}
{"text":"21% Auto grat on preseason games? I'm not sure if I'm cool with that especially if you didn't mention it before starting the tab and failed to mention it when the check was dropped."}
{"text":"Previously have been here before but never really have had good customer care. One goes out to have a little fun an enjoy that afternoon. After going on a Saturday night for my birthday I will definitely be frequenting this place more often. The bartenders Andi and Chris are very polite and have a great enthusiastic personality. They are very attentive to your needs. Highly recommend going Saturday nights with Andi and Chris! Not a dull moment."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday/game 7 of the NBA playoffs here.  The space was perfect for the event and I heard very affordable.  It's held about 25 with good seating and some left over standing room, though the room is a bit divided, if you're obnoxious like me when the situation allows (Sports Bar) you can tell across the room!

The server (Stephanie) was attentive and friendly.  The host ordered a few pizza's and chicken tender baskets.  The food was tasty (BBQ pizza was on point) and the drinks good.  I ordered food and soda's separately, for which our food arrived 1hr 30mins after the fact.... once I reminded Stephanie.  She relayed that the food was delivered \"to the room\".  REALLY... well, that sucks!  Clearly I didn't miss my order too much, as I nibbled on the host provided food.  Overall it was a good time and I'd certainly return.  I'd even reserve the space myself for a future event.

Closing my bill was a bit long, but likely because our server didn't use the bar register (10ft away), but instead trucked it across the restaurant - out of sight."}
{"text":"So...

I get the whole turn around rate and all but some of these servers need a reality check. 

 You CAN'T demand a tip!
The waitress/server came up to our table and tells us that maybe we should ask for the other waitress and then we would be happier. What?! If I work off of tips I wouldn't have said that at all! But to each their own.

I've met some wonderful servers that my friends and I request regularly as we are regulars but some of these new girls think they can just make some quick tips and give sub par service bringing the PT's name and the server name along down in the mud. Excuse me but no! I have server, bartender & other industry friends and they have never acted in like that. 

Jacob the bar tender is always great but the servers eh not as much.

BTW her name is Ajarae"}
{"text":"Update on last review...completely changed management and the place seem to be doing better.  Food was great last night, martinis made by Samantha were amazing!  Close to home so go here quite often and love the atmosphere...if they can keep the kitchen consistent it will be 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for Super Bowl Sunday.  We were in a private room.  There were seven of us.  Overall the entire bar was nowhere near capacity given the occasion so not sure why the service was so lackluster.  Jennifer was our original server and I must have asked for napkins about three times before I went searching for them on my own.  I wasn't able to get anyone's attention at the bar and they don't have them available on the tables so I retrieved some from the restroom.  I'm not kidding when I say there were no napkins at our table even though there was pizza and wings.  Another person in our party was able to retrieve some from the bar.  At this point I had probably asked Jennifer about two more times for napkins as she was coming in and out settling the bill, which she also screwed up.  Finally she brought napkins and made a joke about it like finally I remember after you asked me like 15 times.  I mean that is basic Waitressing 101 and her incompetence was not funny.

At this point another server took over, London.   Unfortunately, she was also horrible.  After being introduced to us she never once came back to check and see if we wanted anything.  Someone else from our party went to the bar to order and London noticed her standing there and said, oh, did you need something? Well, obviously, and if she had bothered to check on us she would have known this.  Since the waitress switch took place around the end of half time not sure why she would think out of seven people no one else would want anymore food or drinks.  And if she never planned on checking on us not sure why Jennifer even introduced her as taking over.  

Overall, the availability of a private room is a nice option. It's basic bar food and drinks at reasonable prices. But I don't see myself coming here again unless I am meeting people and if that is the case I hope Jennifer and London aren't my servers.  ."}
{"text":"While it is still a solid place to grab a drink and a step up from the typical Nevada bar, Sierra Gold used to be a great value with decent food and lots of choices for drinks - no longer.

Unfortunately, PTs (the parent company) seems to have changed their image towards trying to be an upscale bar and restaurant rather than the great locals value that made it so popular. So now it feels like a Yard House with less choice and specials.

Whether it is Sierra Gold or PTs Gold or whichever, their happy hour seems to no longer cover any of their better beers - they are pushing their local brew and domestics. So no more half priced Blue Moons for me.

Additionally, they have fewer and fewer options for food on happy hour. For football specials, they basically dropped all their good specials. They used to have a double cheeseburger for 5 or 6 dollars. What used to be our favorite place for watching a game is no longer even an option to us.

Additionally, service is generally pretty slow here, so there's very little reason to come here anymore."}
{"text":"My first visit to Sierra Gold saw a loss of $40 for me and $20 for my friend in the poker machines before anyone ever stopped by to say hello or take our order - and it wasn't even busy. After that, I was certain it would take angelic intervention to get me back.

While I did see some angels on my second visit, none of them were flying. 

It was Friday happy hour and the place was hoppin', although due in large part to a college reunion group who were having a great time and passing that happiness on to the rest of the bar.

I ordered their half-price HH special sausage and pepperoni pizza. The angel behind the bar asked if I wanted basil on top - what a refreshing suggestion. 

The pizza crust was good and crispy, but very bland. The sauce and topping were good, but would have been great if there was just a little more sauce. Much to my chagrin, HH special half price pizza is actually $10, plus $1 for every topping (yep, they charged me a buck for the basil). Total damage was $15, before tip. For a crispy thin-crust pizza, that's not a special, it's a rip-off. 

At this point our foursome was having a great time with the angels who tended bar and some others who were making their way through the crowd.  The place was about to get, let's say, maybe a 4 star rating  - despite some miserable happy hours prices.

Then disaster struck - happy hour ended and the angels behind the bar were replaced by pissy young men with little sense of humor and even less personality.  

The place took a dramatic change of moods in just a matter of moments and all-of-a-sudden we couldn't wait to get out. 

I leave the review with a shaky 3 star rating and some very strong suggestions to management - reconsider your HH prices and get rid of those depressing boys. Seriously, they were all in such a pissy mood, you could literally see the happiness evaporating from the faces of patrons all around the bar."}
{"text":"Came here on a few different occasions and my latest was for an NBA game. A friend and I sat at a table that had a nice view of the TV's. we were greeted within minutes by our server. She got us our drinks and put in a food order and came to the table several times to ask if we needed refills or more food but we were ok. Because we were not ordering something every few minutes it took longer to actually find our server when we needed her. The place wasn't very busy and I'm not surprised. With the bad service plus mediocre bar food, there are too many better places to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I recently turned 21 and a couple of friends brought me here for my first bar/happy hour experience. Wooo!

My initial impressions is that its in a nice neighborhood, doesn't feel run down, and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Sierra Gold was probably half full, people were having a good time, and some were making out at the bar.. alright! 

The happy hour special is after 12, requires a beer bytes card, and is consisted of half off pizzas and all drinks. Had a large Blue Moon which was in a big mug (maybe 2 bottles?) but had a tiny orange slice. Aw come on now.. the orange is not a decoration it has a real purpose. 

One of my friends ordered his pizza first while me and my other friend decided to think a bit more, it was another 15 minutes before we saw the waitress again, kind of slow.. but understandable I suppose since she was the only waitress taking care of 6 or 7 parties.

So the pizzas were decent, but I'm not expecting something crazy from a bar. It was a thin crust but had many specialty choices like the fajita pizza. I noticed a bit of inconsistency between my fajita pizza and my friend's hunter pizza, his toppings covering almost the pizza to the edge and mine was 2 inches short from the edge. Oh well not a big deal.

Its hard not to want to come back though with the decent food and cheap drinks. Hours and hours can pass away with some friends and a buzz.. which is why I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Didn't experience the restaurant and bar area, and also did not try the food, but the utility of the private space will have me coming back.  I was pretty impressed with their private room called the \"Locker Room\".  

Came here for a meeting the other night, and it was an inviting and comfortable setting, with couches and relaxed atmosphere.  We were able to plug into the TV to have presentations.  It's nice this is not your typical board room, but looks like a spacious den in a home that can fit probably 20 people.  Happy hour was great, 50% off, and in a good part of town.  

The other thing that was impressive was a greeting as we walked through the door.  We couldn't see who it was, but someone behind the bar spotted us coming in right away.  Same thing on our exit, out of nowhere we heard a voice from behind the bar bid us farewell.  It was nice they noticed."}
{"text":"Let me start by admitting that I nor my wife are considered regulars at any local Vegas Bar but this one topped the cake/muffin/ any other desert u can think of????? My wife n I were out celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary and upon depositing 20$ each into the gaming machines we felt that being told about the price of a 25 Oz beer n a water was completely unacceptable by this person and so keep this in mind if u are out and about eating and or gambling. ....plz do not try this place....while the food is great this woman bartender is less than personable!!!!!! She needs more training 4sure:-)"}
{"text":"Been to a few SGS and have been satistied.  This location however is horrible.  Walked in there for happy hour.  Sat a table for 20 minutes and not a single host/hostess asked if we've been helped.   We then asked an employee to get someone who can help us.  Waited another 10 minutes.  Nothing....  if I can give this place a score it would be nothing... they don't even deserve to be one star!!!!"}
{"text":"First, let me say..Christi is the best bartender. 

What I have Ordered.
Wings: 
Bourbon-really good
Hot-average

Pizzas: (half off during happy hour)
BBQ chicken or something, not good. (got it for free because a mess up)
Buffalo chicken ranch was decent  its just chopped up tenders on top.
The Gilroy: Yes, this pizza is amazing.
Meat?:Whatever the meat one is called is good.

Wraps:
Grilled Chicken Chipotle Avocado wrap: I was super impressed on how it was. Very tasty with a nice kick.

Panini:
Turkey Avocado Melt I believe what it is called. It was alright but my avocado was old and to put that on a sandwich with no hesitation left me unimpressed.

Sandwiches:
My buddy ordered an Avocado BLT. Simple but I agree with him about it being tasty."}
{"text":"Went here one evening on the suggestion of my spouse who had been there before. I ordered the roasted chili burger special, and was extremely disappointed when an obviously frozen hockey puck burger with one thin slice of chili showed up. Waitress handled the issue fine, and I must say the ahi tuna salad i ordered as a replacement was wonderful, but the food was hit and miss in my case."}
{"text":"Overpriced items and small portions. Unfriendly inattentive waitresses. Manager made me and my friend leave the bar saying we had to gamble (even though he did). 10 mins later her and her friend have lunch in our spots and the manager didn't gamble at all. Bad customer service, expensive mediocre servings, and boring older local crowd all around."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials that include half price pizzas.  I really enjoy the chicken and ranch pizza with grilled chicken instead of the fried.  I always have great service here and they have a fun and friendly atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I think that their food is a little overpriced. 

Always a great place to meet up with friends and have a few drinks. Have price beers during happy hour from 4-7."}
{"text":"Great experience here the bartenders are amazing and super nice ! I come in here with my husband all the time and give us such great service every time. Ebram and sam are truly amazing!!! They are what keeps us coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.Ive always enjoyed myself here.Maybe I'll go again later this week hmm."}
{"text":"I'm a large fan of the sierra gold properties in general but i particularly like this one the best. It's in the same shopping center as their corporate offices so you get a large gaming / food and beverage industry crowd there.

I've gone to this location for events, after work happy hour, dinner, breakfast during NFL season,and pre-drink before concerts and I've had very consistent service. 

If you're looking to host a small - medium group i highly recommend this location as they have two venues they can host you and they can even offer the happy hour rates to individuals attending. Their food also is really good. It's perfectly priced and the quality is great.

I recommend anything that has the ahi tuna and anything on the breakfast menu including their coffee. The also serve full menu 24 hours. 

My other favorite thing is that i never leave here smelling like smoke which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Awesome Service...why go anywhere else since they have the Happy Hour at 12a-2am its awesome dued to me working the night shift..always feel welcomed..lol"}
{"text":"Me and my girl are so happy we came here. We both had a burger and we were both blown away. It's a sports bar as well but you can converse in a normal tone. Great service too."}
{"text":"Kind of an awkward location that doesn't give you the vibe that your out for a drink. Great menu and very cheap drinks for happy hour. Great place to just come here and watch sports or socialize with friends. The atmosphere however seems like a place for the older crowd. I love the Gilroy pizza."}
{"text":"The Bar is trendy, they have fairly good drinks.  Happy hour is always good, pizza is good, wings are good, Martinis are good. Im more of a night owl so I come in for the midnight happy hour.  The big boy burger is outrageous!
Plenty of space for large partys and the staff is friendly most of the time."}
{"text":"Updating my review to give props to the swing manager and bartender, Heather, who makes this location even more hospitable.  She hosts some unique events at this location (one event was an Oscar party!), which I think is a nice way to make everyone feel like they belong at Sierra Gold.  

There's also been a menu overhaul.  The food is still tasty and a good value."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in North Las Vegas! They have a great happy hour twice daily from 4-7 pm then again from midnight-4 am. 1/2 price drinks and 1/2 price pizza. Also, probably the best pizza in North Las Vegas if you like thin crust pizza!

They also participate in the PT's pub Beer & Bites which gives you 2 for 1 entrees and appitizers plus cash back. Great locals bar.

This place rocks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Typical PT's with an extra helping of arrogance and no fun allowed. 

The food isn't that great, the servers have the attitude of we are the corporate store so we are not friendly. This is one of those PT's that you go to for only one of three reasons. You don't have the gas to get anyplace else and are desperate for a drink, you have friends that insist on meeting a hot chick here or if there is no place else open."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I moved to Vegas over 10 years ago. This location was my second office. The food and service were great. Irish Sean was awesome. I used to book the back room for private meetings.

I moved to Summerlin so this location became a mid-point for meetings. Great location but due the food quality and lack of personalised service I had to moved from 5 stars to 4 stars. 

With that said, I have to present with three stars due to a lunch I had there yesterday.

We came in and sat in the section closest to Jones. Nobody approached us for over 5 minutes so we moved sections. I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad. If you are a Cobb fan or chopped salad fan stay away from this.

The greens they used were like those wild green salads you buy in the store. You know, the ones that taste like dirt? They were not firm and this was hardly a chopped salad with minimal ingredients.

As I dived my way deeper into the salad I stated getting a funky taste like some of the salad was turning.

I only ate half of it and we had to leave. I complained to the server and she told me she would tell the chef. She made no effort to make this right and I am a club member hence the three star rating."}
{"text":"This place is dead during football season. All their competitors are running happy hour specials so everyone else seems to go elsewhere. They raise their prices during football games. The only reason I even come it's because I'm guaranteed a seat and they change the TV to whatever game I want. Or if I come early enough I can get the breakfast special before the game starts. Its only good to come here during the NFL if you like to be a loner . Good for loners but dumb for Sierra gold."}
{"text":"We went here during happy hour on February 10 -- very disappointing:
50% off cocktails -- short pour, minimal (if any) vodka in the cosmos -- even after I complained to our waiter, the second one was just as bad. What is the point of half off cocktails, if the quality is more than half off?????
Signature shrimp and grits -- horrible!  Grits weren't even completely cooked, and shrimp was tasteless.
Chicken quesadilla and burgers were just OK.  Nothing to go back for.
Service was definitely slow.  

Definitely not a place to return to."}
{"text":"Very good food and beer selection... the bar layout is a little non-traditional, pretty friendly staff except that they hound you for spending at least $20 every 10 minutes to keep getting comped draft beer."}
{"text":"Recently opened, so everything is nice and new. The menu is pretty extensive, but for the most part it is your typical bar food. Maybe a little better. Try the Flamin' Hot Cheetos onion rings...Yes, you read that right...Tasty.  Pretty much your standard PT's crowd, with a few strange ones...I think there must have been a tailgate party going on in the parking lot, because people kept coming in with red plastic cups...Could'nt figure that one out. I'll go back I'm sure, but that because its close to my house. :) Wait staff was very friendly, and the bartenders were on top of things."}
{"text":"Ok, this location of Sierra gold did not compare at all to the Henderson location. While they look almost identical from the inside, this locations service was horrible. Especially at the bar. The bartenders seem to spend all of their time on the other side of the bar, which is separated by a large centerpiece that they can't see through. We even had to wait about 20 minutes just to get our bill, 20 minutes after we asked for it.  I think I took an unintentional nano nap. After sitting at the bar we moved into the restaurant portion. The server here was a little more on top of things, even though she came across like she was very new. I didnt get anything to eat except for crispy fried mozzerella, which was nothing to right home about. It tasted like the frozen TGIF brand mozzeralla you can get at any grocery store. In fact it looked like it too. May have actually been. :) I didnt get the Flamin' Hot Cheeto onion rings this time, but wish I had, since they were the highlight of my last visit to the Henderson branch."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night and they were understaffed ! I applaud the one server that had one whole section and the other girl helping bring out all the food. There is a late happy hour at midnight so  we tried the delicious pork sliders with  half Off drinks. My only gripe other than there not being enough staff is that  two of us  paid seperately in a group and was charged the large group gratuity."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and eat here frequently.  No more.  The service has become so poor.  Nasty women acting like they have better things  to do than take our order  Our last trip to Sierra Gold was to talk about using them as a venue for our Christmas party.  Thank goodness Parkway Tavern opened.  Food is delicious.  Service is incredible.  SIERRA Gold could learn a lot from them"}
{"text":"Get the wings and a giant beer.  Perfect.  Seriously though, the wings are awesome.  There's also pool, golf machines and video poker plus a bunch of TV's with sports on.  The staff are friendly and it's not too expensive.  I love it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good food, amazing service, Brady and Alex are always on top of their game!! Also other bartenders on the same shift are great!! Always a good time!!"}
{"text":"Wings, pizza, beer. Nothing really stood out so I guess it was just A-OK. Service was great, but we were the only ones there! Lol."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends for a few drinks, decent happy hour - 50% off all drinks and pizza. Their pizza is decent, seems a little inconsistent like the crust will be a little different sometimes but it's still good. They have a great fried shrimp and calamari appetizer that my girlfriend loves, come with a  sweet chili sauce and Sriracha for a kick.
Usually have had good service, there was one waitress once who seemed like she was pissed that she had to serve people for a living - and her tip reflected that but mostly service is good, the bartenders are very friendly too.
Good TV placement, usually can see pretty much wherever you sit so it's a good place to catch a game or whatever. Can get crowded too but that just adds to the ambiance of a good tavern!"}
{"text":"Good size bar with restaurant area (not walled off or separate), cool little lounge area with sofa's and chairs and some TV's. We went just for drinks, service was good. Prices are okay, not the cheapest place to drink, but not Strip prices either. We paid $7 for a vodka soda and $7 for a large draft beer. But the atmosphere is pretty chill so it's a good place for a happy hour or just to relax with a drink."}
{"text":"A top end poker bar with a good menu, lots of beers and friendly staff.  Great atmosphere and not smokey ."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is a nice bar to chill at.  Plenty of people if you don't like the dead atmosphere.  The food's pretty good.  It's good to know the bartender too.  There's pool tables there to play on which is about it.  It's spaced out pretty nicely too, and people can enjoy watching the games on the flat screen televisions."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE breakfast/lunch spot in VEGAS, their menu is HUGE, its so hard to make a decision, My favorite dish is definitely the Chicken fried steak its just amazing, and hits the spots those days after drinking in vegas and waking up around noon.  I found this place from one of my buddies whose a local, and everytime im in vegas i go here for lunch or breakfast there are no lines like the dinners or restaurants at the strip, and its good to get away from the strip for a bit."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that the server named Shelly was such a pleasure. I was having a horrible day as I just lost my pet Rabbit that morning. I ordered drinks to numb my pain and she was so sad for me and comped me even my drink. This little bit of human affection and kindness really made it better. Thank you shelly"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Good food, draft beer, nice atmosphere and excellent service! Five star definitely"}
{"text":"My husband and I spent $180 in video poker over an hour and a half but they still charged me for 2 glasses of wine. I have never been to a bar that charged for drinks while gambling and I will never come back to this establishment. This place is a total ripoff!"}
{"text":"Food is as you would expect, typical bar and grill food. The salads are good, but the \"cheeto\" french fries are just weird and sort of gross. The regular fries taste like KFC fries (Lawrys seasoning) and the chicken wings are okay. 

The reason for two stars is first the price... $20 for a pizza, $13 for salad, $11 for a burger.. this place is a locals place, but I'm not sure how the locals are affording it. I even bought into the club  card-- not that it will ever pay off because I won't be back.

The second reason is service.. our waitress whom we rarely saw was almost rude, slaming things down on the table, no smile, and never came back after bringing the food. We literally had to hunt her down for our check and when the check came it was another 15 minutes before my husband had to get up and go and find her. 

On another note, the biker uniform tops should go! These waitresses are old and look like they are washed up from the strip. Just a hint, while I'm eating my food I do not want to see your freckly boobs or ceasarean scar!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast, excellent food and really great prices. Andrea is always such a pleasant server and a true asset to sierra gold."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink and take it easy.  Happy hour from 4p - 7p and the menu is very good for bar food.  

Service is good, bar tenders will walk around the bar to make sure your drink is full.  Was impressed with wait staff, only 2 on duty on the Wednesday night we visited but they always made sure drinks were full and our needs were met."}
{"text":"Have tried the nachos and thin crust BBQ chicken pizza in the past. Both I liked. I decided to try the breakfast. The parking lot alway has lots of cars outside so the food must be good. Ordered the Sierra Benedict. This dish was just a regular eggs Benedict with lots of potatoes and onions on it. The food is bar food, nothing spectacular. The service was very friendly with lots of smiles. The place is very clean. No pool tables anymore and the upstairs is a big meeting room. Notice business meetings occurring. Must be a good place for that."}
{"text":"The foods pretty tasty and they have good happy hour deals. Robin was our waitress and she made our night incredibly awesome! She was the best waitress and seems like a genuinely nice person! Thank you for making our experience that much better, Robin. We'll definitely be back, especially if you're our waitress."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in town! Every day 5-7 PM and 12-2 AM. Half off drinks and pizzas.

If you're doing it right, you're ordering the Gilroy pizza! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Been to several Sierra Gold's around town (and this location years ago) but this one nowadays didn't have the same service or quality I've come to expect. 
My wife & I split beef nachos & each had a side salad. We ended up leaving most of the nachos on the plate because they were the worst nachos we have gotten anywhere in the valley and the salads were not much better. 

Will be bad to Sierra Gold's, just not this location."}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast this morning on the way to the Run For the Wish 5K.  I had to buzz to get in because it was only 7:30 or so when I got here.  The front door was unlocked, and in I went to a very dark place.

I was given a menu and time to look it over.  When I asked about one of the breakfasts, he said to me that all of their dishes are large portions.  I ordered the Miner's Breakfast, a combination of many sliced potatoes along with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, onions, and peppers all topped with melted cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  It was very tasty, and it was too much.  Things here seem to be made for two people. 

I was served coffe in the beginning, but I never was asked about a refill.  Service was a bit slow, but since there were only three of us there, it should have been better.  I took away one star for the service and the no refill on the coffee.

I did enjoy breakfast and I'll continue my tradition of having breakfast at a different place before each of the events like this that I do."}
{"text":"First off, I really like the food.  The quality is good-to-exceptional and execution/presentation is good as well.  My issue isn't with the food.  It is with their handling of their own monthly food discounts/offers, called \"Beer And Bites Club\". BTW, I like the waitstaff but it seems that the disconnect is between marketing and management (according to a manager).  The last time I was there, the manager also didn't want to accept my Yelp check-in (1 Free Domestic Pint or Well Drink).  He acted like Yelp was almost some type of scam where Yelp creates bonuses without businesses knowing. 

It has gotten to the point that the regulars that I go with will no longer go.  They used to go twice a week and me, once a week.  Hopefully someone will read this & fix the problem.  I will give this location one more chance, but I am not confident that anything will change.

To make this a little more constructive:
1) Football specials are/were amazing
2) Great burgers; the Kobe is exceptional
3) Excellent BBQ ribs, meaty, tender, & slathered in BBQ sauce
4) Coconut Shrimp appetizer seems like it belongs in a Steak House, the taste & presentation are so good. Sweet coconut+savory shrimp+great sauce=amazing!
5) Great ambiance

With all said & done, the 3 star rating is being given because of my past experiences during football season.  If I were to base it on my last 3 visits, 2 stars.

Please, please Adonna, please read this & correct the problems..."}
{"text":"We've been coming here the past few Sunday's to watch the Jets and Giants games. They have a lot of good breakfast options and the food is good. If you order breakfast before 10 AM it's 50% off, which is another perk. The reason that I have them 3 stars is because the service is rough. Our orders never come out right and they are always missing items. They also don't bring everything out at once. Service is also very slow, as they tend to be understaffed on Sundays. I will say that the waitresses are sweet and do try. I know it's not their fault. The only reason we come back is because of the food, ability to watch multiple games and it's not very smokey."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (12 of 365).

I love Sierra Gold!  This place is always poppin' and at any time of day.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner here 24-7 and they have 2 happy hours.  The bartenders and waiters are always inviting when you come in the door, and the atmosphere is super chill.  It's a nice weekly hangout and good for Monday night football, Sunday football, and pretty much for any game as they have a number of TVs available to watch any game playing on any given day.

Their menu is fairly extensive but I enjoy a few things that are at the top of my must eat on a monthly basis list:

# 1 - Gilroy Pizza.  Best thin crust pizza on their menu.  All pizzas are half off during their happy hour!

# 2 - Wings. with any sauce on the side.  They have a number of sauces to choose from!

# 3 - Tuna Panini Sandwich - it's a hit or miss, but if they make it right; it's so good because of the extra cucumber crisp they add in the sandwich.

# 4 - Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie! Yum!  Best dessert to indulge in when you're having a bad day.

You can gamble on their video poker bartops, sports bet, and they even have a secret rewards program for women who gamble in the bar.  Awesome!

Their private dining area with the big screen TV only costs $20 to rent plus of course you have to purchase food and drink, but there is no minimum tab which is awesome.

This is definitely my neighborhood bar; forever!"}
{"text":"This is a clean little bar with a \"Cabin\" feel.  It is not very busy most of the time and is very clean.  They only have one pool table, but it only cost $2.50 to use the equipment for as long as you want.  The food is just ok bar food."}
{"text":"ZOMGG Zooookieee!!!111one!!!1

Think of a warm fresh cookie straight out the oven underbaked in a ramekin topped off with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.   Now picture your nipples harden with every bite and a smile so cheesy that even the PDA to the 3rd power couples next to you is weirded out.

This is a good dessert if you want to either share with a special friend or just want to treat yourself something very delectable.  I'd scrap every last bite whenever i get to order this goodness.

Of the other food i tried, i think the Steak and Eggs is a good bargain.  You get 3 eggs, an 8oz steak, Country Hash Potatoes, and a side of Toast for like 9.99.  Not bad considering it's a bar.

Pretzel bites were soggy and overly salty.  The cheese and sweet and sour sauce that came with it were cool.  A cup of chili to start my meal was mediocre.  I prefer the Chili at Wendy's but that's just me.  Overall everything else i tried here wasn't too bad for a late night meal

But I'm telling you man.. You must do yourself a favor and get a zookie..  It's one of those things you have to try at least once before you die."}
{"text":"We have been to Sierra Gold several times over the past couple of years. The most recent visit was on this past Friday, during Happy Hour (which is always the happiest hour of a Friday!). I was happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at Sierra Gold (some places end too early!). To my understanding, in order to receive the half-priced drinks & appetizers, you must be a \"Beers & Bites\" card holder (which is free to enroll and provides other positive benefits too!). We ordered two rounds of drinks, one of which included their \"Prickly Pear\" beverage; the ingredients listed all sounded good enough to quench our thirst, but the end result was a little too \"thick\" for our liking and while the mixture was good, the consistency did not quench anything. We also ordered their popcorn chicken with twister fries (which are always fun!) and a thin pizza (which I believe was the only half-priced appetizer offered). So in conclusion (1) I believe they need to revisit their \"Prickly Pear\" recipe, and (2) they need to consider adding more half-priced appetizers to their happy hour menu, oh and (3) is it necessary to charge $0.50 for an extra sauce (for the popcorn chicken?). The waitress was attentive and the service was good, so we will probably return again and try their other menu options."}
{"text":"Great food, ice cold beer and fairly attentive wait staff.  The layout is also roomy and inviting.  The management's tendency to close off areas/alcoves that are ideal for watching a game at a booth or table (regardless of how many people are in the bar) is off-putting.  I was also distressed (while visiting several weeks ago) to be presented a bill for $19 for two large Stone IPA.  I'd never encountered prices like these in any previous visits, so this left a bad taste in my mouth as I was leaving.  I'm a local, dammit!  Why charge me Las Vegas strip prices?!"}
{"text":"Service is slow..on slow and busy night..either they need to get more bartenders or they need to stop checking themselves out in the mirror..and do some good service.."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times during the last 2 weeks.  Both times were either a Fri night or Sat night during March Madness so there were a ton of people.  The first time we came, we ordered beers and appetizers, when the food came out, the chips that came with the spinach dip were stale..it also came with bread which was fine.  The next time we came, we ordered pizza and pretzel bites and the food wasn't like we remembered it a while back.  The pizza was super dry and well done and the pretzel bites which I remember were really good was served differently and tasted different.  We also had one server in the beginning of the night and then never saw her again and I guess some other server took over.  This was just confusing because we weren't sure if our server was coming back or who was taking our table/section over? We came one more time just for a few beers and as we were sitting for a while no one came by the table so we just decided to order our drinks at bar and bring them back to the table.  I'm giving 3 stars for the service which is not consistent as well as the food quality which is not consistent either.  The happy hour is not bad though and at least they have a few more food options available then most bars, we also like the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Nice 'home plate' bar for locals, I love the brews here and the (mostly female) waitstaff makes you feel right at home. Service is usually good to great at this location, though it can get a bit busy around industry lunch time. Today I went for a 'healthier' option opting for the chicken fajita bowl. I have to say I was a bit unimpressed with the drab plate that came out of the kitchen. There was 7 small cuts of chicken, a few stringy veggies, and a bunch of soy sauce on the rice (for a fajita bowl?? That should be the teriyaki bowl). I was unimpressed with my meal, coming to $13. Why are the healthier options always skimpy and more expensive? That's my only complain this time, the only item I ordered. PUT MORE MEAT ON THE PLATE! 
Everyone else at my table was satisfied, however the boneless wings the table got were very hard- over cooked, maybe they had been cooked and were sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Not sure. Come here for the wings, burgers/sandwiches and of course... da beers!!"}
{"text":"Brought clients in for lunch which is near their office. I've dined  here in the past but it been years since last time I was visited. Sierra Gold is a upscale tavern with even a part of the PT's group which I wasn't aware of.  Parking is easy to locate since the parking lot is large.

There were five in our party and we were seated where a pool table was once located. The waitresses here are really hot looking and ours was no exception. Tattooed and friendly she was on her game. I went with the ahi salad which was delish. Generous amounts of sliced ahi over mixed greens with jicama, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickled ginger, wasabi and sesame dressing. Everybody in our group was happy with their food and beverages.

Sierra Gold offers Happy Hour from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm to 2:00 am everyday. I'll definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"I come here quite often for their breakfast because they have a happy hour from 6-10. The quality of the food is great, and the customer service is great as well. I would recommend this establishment to anyone who wants to go for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place. The beer selection is great. The staff is always friendly. The locker room is amazing. We usually reserve it during football season."}
{"text":"Came for the clean bar, the TVs and good food. Left after 1 drink because of the terrible service from Dawn. Will avoid her shift and leave when she's working. Rude and leaves you to basically get your own drinks."}
{"text":"Meet my future wife and girlfriend of the last 7 years here and come back often even though we moved to the other side of town. Nice spot still."}
{"text":"Very Unhappy, work close by and finally got a chance to go in for lunch. 50 cents for ranch to go with the salad, Tiny little Bloody Mary's turned out to be $8.50 a pop, the server offered salad to replace rice with our meal. BUT never mentioned an upcharge of $2.00. I returned half of my salad upon finding a black hair in it and all they said was \"Sorry about that\" same answer we got when we complained and said we would not be returning. Very poor response when this could have been a nice close lunch place. $78.00 for 3 people to have a terrible lunch. Guess we will be sticking with the Village Pub."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been here a few times before and have always left somewhat neutral. The food is somewhat ok. Service is \"meh\" sometimes. I will admit though, I did have a bar back/busser/porter (I dont really know what he was to tell you the truth) step up his game and give us better service than our server one time. So kudos to him.

But the reason Im finally writing a review and giving this place a 2 star is due to my recent visit on 6/4/11 night shift. I came in to meet a few friends, got a couple of beers, signed my check and called it a night. Upon reading my bank statement yesterday, it appears I was double charged on the tip I left. Not cool, ms. bartender. This is my credit card you guys are playing with. Mind you, it could have just been a simple mistake, which happens. But being in this industry myself, making that mistake, whether unintentional or intentional, is some serious shit."}
{"text":"Have been going here on and off for the last 7 years.  Never had a complaint.  Always good service and friendly staff for a late night drink.  I've even recommended this place for a good neighborhood bar for friends who moved up north.  You could imagine my disappointment when my boyfriend and I went there last Saturday and he got food poisoning off the chicken wings he ordered."}
{"text":"Overall the mood is set and it's a clean gig.  But there's my many video poker spots reservered for players and the servers are inattentive.  Yet I really like the lighting.They often play music that most places do not.  That's refreshing."}
{"text":"Very good spot for Happy Hour drinks with coworkers. Easy location on the 215 and solid prices from 5-7 pm. I've also been to a couple of larger parties there and they always do a very nice job. For the Las Vegas locals, this is basically a nicer version of PTs. Great at what they do, but not really a destination spot. This is the place everyone agrees on. Beer is cold!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. I have been here twice with friends from work. We work very near this place, and many of them come regularly, but that doesn't ensure any customer service at all. Both times the service has been awful. After an evening of slooooow service, one couple was ready to leave & asked for the check after waiting a long time to finally locate our waitress. Just for conversation, he happened to show us all the time and he literally waited 53 minutes from requesting the check until the waitress returned his change. Yes, FIFTY-THREE MINUTES AFTER all food & drink were long gone! And you know what pissed off his wife? She wanted to order a couple more drinks to  entertain herself while sitting there (almost) an extra hour, but our waitress was just gone. No waitstaff in the entire place. My work friends have been here many times and they sometimes have really good service. I have two suggestions:
1) Reserve \"The Locker Room\" if you are coming with a group. My friends had good service that way.

Or 2) Sit at the bar & play video poker so you can deal directly with the bartender.

Both times I was here I sat with a group of 12 (last night) or 15 people (in early spring) at the tables. Our waitress was unable the accomplish the tasks of taking food and drink orders, delivering said food and drink orders and bringing a bill. Items were wrong, drinks were missed altogether, drinks took 30 minutes or more to arrive, happy hour is 5-7, but half of the items on the bill were charged full-price. Now, we arrived after work at exactly 5 and every one of us was done eating before 7, so this should not be difficult. We were so tired of waiting and waiting and waiting that we just paid and didn't contest the bill which had tons of errors and just left. The place was NOT that busy, but both times I've had awful service, the waitresses told us someone called in sick, so I guess I just have bad luck. Both times the (different) waitresses also told us they were new (on the job 2 weeks). So can we train some people to know the menu and/or the computer billing? I think the bill took forever because she literally did not know how to ring us up, so she just started pushing random buttons and our bill was a mess.
The waitress actually had the nerve to tell us several times, \"Well, I'm back here at table 36, my problem table.\" Really? You don't want the tip from 12 thirsty customers who are ordering tons of food and drink? The problem is not knowing your menu, not knowing your happy hour specials, not remembering the name of the drink I ordered so you communicate that to the bartender, charging us double the happy hour rates, charging us for drinks no one in our party ordered (not only getting drink names wrong, but actually adding expensive extra charges to our bill) and generally blaming us and getting pissy about everything. One person did get testy with the waitress after 2 hours of this business, but not until a full 40 minutes after she requested the check. The rest of us were socializing and talking and not mad, but getting very thirsty because no one was there to take a drink order. A couple of girls went to the bar and immediately got a drink, which really pissed off our server (no tip, I get it), but we had literally not seen her anywhere in the bar for over 30 min so we thought she was on her lunch. We had to find our own napkins, our own silverware and our own boxes back in the kitchen for leftovers because we could not find anyone to help us. 

I do not plan to EVER go back (strike two, you're OUT), but like a dummy, I actually gave them a second chance. I suggest if you do want to get a small group, sit at a table and order some food and drinks, make sure you ask if anyone has called in sick that day. Our waitress wouldn't even crack a smile when I first met her (20 min after I arrived!) and I told her I was a Niner fan. She kind of scowled at me and didn't answer and I pointed out the fact that she was wearing a Niners shirt. Okay, I guess your boss told you to wear that. Sorry for trying to be friendly. It only went straight downhill from there. No jokes, no smile, rare half-hearted apologies, and lots and lots and lots of excuses. 

Ma'am, if you had just been courteous, told us you were short-staffed and you were trying your best, coming to let us know drinks were on the way, instead of blaming us for all of your mistakes, we would be very sympathetic. We're healthcare workers, we're good at that. But this was crazy. 
Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a company party and had a great time. It was held upstairs in the private room. We enjoyed it so much we came back the next night to see what the first floor was all about. A little smokey if someone lights up near you, but the ventilation is pretty good. They have the PTs brewing line. I love IPAs, and theirs is pretty good....even better if you and gaming and the drinks are free! The food I have tried (mostly from the catering side)is solid. We did try the potstickers at the main bar, and they were pretty good. I give it 4 stars because the location is perfect for me, service is great, and they have craft beer."}
{"text":"My favorite spot after work. The staff is nice and friendly and most of them already know my orders. Everything I've tried here has been really good top 2 things for me to eat Calamari and Shrimp fried and tossed with banana peppers and cilantro served with sweet and spicy dipping sauced. GFC Bourbon Wings with Coo Coo fries. Love the Coo Coo fries they have a sweet and spicy taste. One thing I have to say I dislike is if my regular bartender is not there it takes me a little longer to put my order in and to get my bill."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The waitress was attentive, however, her interaction seemed forced. A couple days later I found she/someone charged me $13.64 for the Miners Breakfast and then another $5.00 for who knows what.. obviously someone doesn't know what they're doing behind the register. I highly advise paying in cash if you want to go to this Sierra Gold. If you want better service where they don't fuck up your check, go to the location on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the first time I wrote a review while I was in the venue but that's how great of an experience I had here. Originally I stopped by for a quick drink to kill some time in between errands & heard many great things about it from friends. I ordered my go-to (grey goose dirty martini, extra dirty, no olives) Although dirty martinis are a common cocktail, I find that rarely do bartenders make it right. But it was perfect. My bartender was this cute girl w/braces (never caught her name) but super friendly, attentive service. When I checked my schedule, I realized that I had an extra hour to kill rather than 30 minutes so I ordered the Cajun ahi salad. My food literally came in less than 10 min. But the best part was that my ahi tuna salad came with 8 HEARTY WHOLE pieces of ahi. I'm a creature of habit, so when I order ahi salads at other places, I almost expect a measly 4-5 pieces at the most. Not only did I have a great portion, but the quality of fish was soooo good. (Trust me, I'm Asian, I know) the wasabi aioli on the side & sesame dressing really complimented the ahi. + it's only $13?! For the portion of fish they give, this could easily been a $20 salad anywhere else. I guess what took me most by surprise is that this is a neighborhood bar. Although I expected good drinks, I did not expect their food quality to be that great. But it more than exceeded it. Also, cool non-creepy bar patrons. Everybody just does their own thing. As a single gal that loves to be left alone, it's a major plus.. Will definitely be my go to neighborhood bar. You rock Sierra. 5 stars+

P.s never smelled any smoke the whole time. & the bathrooms smell nice haha. & nice lighting. Girls dig that Shit.

UPDATE: Docking a star. Maybe I spoke too soon. When I asked to close out & to watch my drink while I went to the bathroom, they decided to instead clear it. If I wasn't on a time crunch I would've been an asshole about it. But still... Not cool dude. Ask next time ladies, before you clear it!! If I'm paying $12+ for a drink I'd like to finish it, Thanks."}
{"text":"Really hate to do this, but this was my favorite bar to eat at until now! I didn't realize they switched to No One Under 21 till I walked in with my kids for dinner and was told that we had to leave! No sign posted anywhere! They have great food here and I'll never go back because the obvious didn't care about local families when the decided to allow smoking! What's wrong with the patio if you want to smoke?"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrible.  We order appetizers and the server \"forgot\" to put them in.  The food was late and cold.  We went to the bar to order drinks cause the server was non-present....only stayed because we were trying to watch the game.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Unbelievable how rude servers were to us. We had a party of four on Friday night, ready for the weekend to start! We were blown off by couple servers. Waited there for 20 minutes, nobody even acknowledged us. A server helped tables next to us couple of times and completely ignored us! We picked up and left. Got great service at Tap House-the complete opposite of Sierra Gold. We are never coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I like to end my night here after a good day out chilling with friends. The atmosphere feels welcoming and the bartenders are cool. The pizza being half off after 11:00 including a military discount only makes this place my favorite bar for the chill."}
{"text":"This is a great local joint. A killer happy hour and a great staff make this place tops. I recommend highly, don't forget your Beer Bites card!!!! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Of all the local pubs the PT's family is my favorite. This place is no exception. Half off breakfast everyday from 6am to 10 am! The wings are fantastic. Great service. As a hidden gem, they have meeting/event space upstairs. Make sure to get the Beer and Bites card to earn points and get free food! I say stop in and enjoy the great food and drinks! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This is an okay location that doesn't seem to get overly crowded. 

My first visit to this location was a few years ago and it seem like they've definitely made some improvements since that time. The bar is fairly large and we've never had a problem finding a seat in front of the gaming. There are plenty of tables set back a bit from the bar and a couple of games at the back. The bathrooms are clean as well.  The bartenders are pretty good and check in fairly often.

My mixed drinks have always been good. The food is standard bar food so not bad, but nothing notable either. The chicken fingers and boneless wings are standard fried food. The nachos are decent and the serving is huge, definitely enough for two to share."}
{"text":"Might be my new favorite watering hole.

I came here for happy hour with my co-workers. I wasn't very excited about this place, because my first experience here was just mediocre. However, being the new guy in the office, I was thrilled to get an invite to hang out with popular workers in the office.  I went to the bathroom and told myself to suck it up and try not to be weird. It was my first invite in 6 months, so I really, really didn't want to screw this up.

I was surprised how busy the place was. I was equally surprised that we were able to get a table without waiting. I got a frosty 24 oz mug of Guinness for $3.50. After drinking and laughing, I got hungry and ordered a large pizza. The pizza was 50% off during happy hour and it was amazing. I went with the Gilroy and it was loaded with toppings and had a very thin, crisp crust. Freakin' delicious! For $9.99, that is really hard to beat. My only compliant is they need some more items on the happy hour munchies menu. I wouldn't mind chowing down some nachos, fries, or wings. Service is okay and bathrooms are clean. Overall, great experience.

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"Came in not knowing what to expect. Well Sean was the bartender. He updated our player cards, got our drinks and food. We ordered medium chicken wings (delicious) and the green chile sliders with twister fries. All of the food was delicious! Atmosphere dead on perfect and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great location. Come here twice a month maybe. Service is good. Comps could be better, but this is a great spot. Better that the other divey-feeling local bars."}
{"text":"Went to this place about a week ago and it was okay. The service was good. The waitress was really nice. Ordered some calamari appetizer and fries. It was pretty good.  I'll probably stop by again. It's a quiet place to go just to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is the first establishment I have ever yelped solely on the basis of leftovers out of a friend's fridge. Yes, seriously. AH-MAZE-ING. Super yummy. The thinest most delicious crust, an amazingly wonderful non-tomato based sauce with black pepper perfectly distributed over the delicious goat cheese and sun dried tomatos. Mmmmmmmm.  Oh yes, and half-off between 12 am and 4 am. I may actually have to go =)"}
{"text":"This is a very attractive bar, lots of wood, and black and white and sienna posters rimming most of the walls, with vibrantly colored ones on one of them.

Almost all the tables in the restaurant area are pub tables, with very comfortable stools.  There are a few booths in the back, but these are all a step up.  I'm always looking for places to go for Happy Hour but, unfortunately, this won't cut it.  One of my friends is in a wheelchair and there is absolutely no way to accommodate her if she's with us, which is nearly always.  Seems to me this is a violation of ADA regs, and I brought it to the attention of the management.  

But we were here for dinner, so it wasn't an issue.  I was happy that they had some very good cider on tap, and Herb had a huge beer at a good price.  I checked the menu online before we went, and he was looking forward to the Beef Stew special to go along with it, but alas, it was nowhere to be found on the extensive menu.  They did have a big Greek salad with chicken, so he enjoyed that.

My Turkey with Avocado and Swiss sandwich had lots of avocado, not a lot of cheese (which is okay with me and my doctor), and a good amount of turkey.  But the turkey was way too salty.  The cole slaw that went along with it (instead of fries) was good and plentiful.

Overall, I really like Sierra Gold, because I like the atmosphere.  Contrary to what they say, you CAN eat the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I should've known better. I asked a coworker to join me for a beer after work. His response \"hell no their service sucks\".  I went anyway with three others, two of them being bartenders and the other a food server. After not being acknowledged for probably 10min the bartender asks for our order. Two Stellas on draft. She walks away and starts a conversation with a coworker. Never brings our beer. I then watch her pour beer which I thought was ours and then disappear to the other side. So after 10 more min or so another bartender asks if we've been helped. To which we reply we weren't sure, so he gets us the beers. We watched this service continue for about an hour with just about everyone who sat on her side of the bar. It was almost comical. On a good note the other bartender did his best to keep the ship afloat. And they still have the best thin crust pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"this place used to have the best wings in town before they changed the age to 21 and over ONLY.

We decided to go there because we happened to be out without the kids and get some wings.  The lemon pepper wings seemed like the cook dumped the entire bottle of pepper on the wings.  The garlic parmasion wings were greasy and very vingery.  

I don't know if the cook on this particular day was having a bad day, not on his game or ever had a game.  Needless to say, another place which used to have GREAT food and decent service now hit the SUCKS category and is no long a place we will visit.  It is sad to say that wings are also becoming a hard item to find in this town.  

You had a great place why did you have to change????  You used to have great chefs, why did you have to change???"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with some girlfriends after a long day. You definitely cannot beat their drink specials, $7 for two rum and diet cokes. Yes please, all day.

The service was good too. Our waitress consistently checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. Not sure on the choice of apparel but hey it's Vegas so maybe they're just trying to fit the scene. 

The food was pretty good too for bar food. I had the ahi which was accompanied with a nice wasabi sauce and slaw. Not something you'd typically get from a bar but surprisingly very good. I'm sure I'll be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast before heading out to Nascar. We were actually headed to Babystacks but they had an hour wait for a table and this place was right next door. Great choice. Huge Chicken Fried steak, Monster Ruben sandwich, 25 OZ beers, great service and right now they had half price breakfast before 10AM. It was so good that we went back again the next morning. The service was excellent, the food was great. We left both days happy and full. Doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bar stops. Been coming here for a couple years now and will continue coming for the service. Shoutout to Jacob especially for being such a great bartender!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Sierra Gold for watching games and eating late night meals since I moved to Vegas in 07.  I have some fond memories here:
1) my mom's visit when she wanted scrambled eggs and pancakes for dinner
2) many Longhorn alumni watch parties in the back private room, screaming and cheering - the one that stands out is our 9AM games where I come in and order breakfast like corned beef hash and an iced tea
3) going with a kooky friend who flirted with the waitress who mentioned many times she was taken
4) reading textbooks for a class during the SUPERBOWL and drinking a blue moon
5) my television EXPLODED (meaning it truly caught on fire) when the Duke-Texas game in march madness was about to start, so after cooling it off, I went to Sierra Gold to watch the game and the bartender asked, \"Are you that weird girl who studied during the superbowl last month?\"

The menu is good - I like the wraps, the parmesan risotto side dish, the ahi tuna sandwich, and the shrimp/calamari appetizer, but there are lots of choices.  The pear salad is pretty good except the pears are canned ...but service is generally good and it is very cozy to watch games, and not too smoky.  Open 24 hrs and happy hour is half off pizzas, I think 9pm-12am."}
{"text":"Food is pretty awful.  Kurt waitresses, but the building is nice.  If you are going for a game then this will be fine, but if you're looking for good food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rissa J. needs to lay off the heroin and chill the fuck out. She wins, machine doesn't print out the ticket and she losses her shit. The bartenders did all they could but it was up to the slot tech to fix the issue. Rissa was yelling across the bar at other guests and yelled at the bartenders. If anything they had a lot of patience to deal with her annoying, loud obnoxious ass!"}
{"text":"They give a discount to employees that work at Mountain View hospital (thanks to my hubs!) and it feels very open.

They charged us extra when we ordered nachos and there was hardly any salsa on there. That seemed rather silly to me since we were playing at the bar, plus ordered food and drinks. $2 for salsa is necessary, but free drinks are ok when you are playing? Odd.

It was alright, and Matt the swing bartender was nice, but I think they could up their customer service levels just a tad."}
{"text":"Least favorite of all Sierra Gold's. Service always seems to be lack luster and you have to lose $20 per drink so it makes more sense to buy than to play."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends to watch a game.

Servers are nice and attentive, the building is nicely constructed and the food was above average. They have a pretty good happy hour menu in terms of food and drink. Lots of TV's everywhere so it would be good to catch games when many are on at the same time. The ambiance of the place is also quiet enough where you can catch up with friends.

My total came out to $40, which included a philly cheesesteak and fries, two cocktails, dessert, and tips (18%)

I would return for a drink and a meal."}
{"text":"Services and food the first time was amazing! But sadly my husband and I came back a second time and it was Horrible. I will never go spent my money here again! Took 20 minutes after I requested to get my check and it was wrong. To start our visit here we waited 10 minutes just to order our breakfast and drinks. When we asked why the check was incorrect the bartender proceeded to get an attitude with me and my husband. I will never be back to this Sierra Gold again."}
{"text":"I like the layout and the couches.  Food is actually not bad at all for a bar.  Service is good but the bartenders are busy so be patient and they will treat you well.  It is LOUD in here during gametime so be prepared to shout your conversations.  On off nights it is pleasant enough to have a pint and enjoy a book if you want."}
{"text":"I think their food is pretty good BUT it never fails Every time I order the pear salad it's always missing something! It's like the waitress isn't listening. Or I order wings and I ask for blue cheese and always get ranch! It's little things like this that makes the experience and the prices I pay irritating. I want to get what I pay for. I don't want to get home with my take out and dip a wing and discover its in a dressing I hate or that my salad is all together wrong! BUT they are always very accommodating and fix their error and compensate me for it, but it happens all too often."}
{"text":"The draw of Sierra Gold: decent food, great prices, nice interior/furniture, flexible hours, and location. Sounds like a recipe for success. Great way to screw it up: inconsistencies with food quality and more importantly, customer service. I've been here more times than I can count and it was a solid choice for quick eats and gatherings. After my last experience, the chances of another visit is zero. 

One month prior to a surprise party I was planning for Ruben's 30th birthday, I called them for information regarding their VIP lounge. I was told that it was just $40 to reserve the room and that a menu wasn't required (guests could order and pay freely). It was perfect for what I needed! I asked for a particular date and after being on hold for a few minutes, the associate confirmed that the date was available. Before providing my credit card information for the deposit, I confirmed that it was indeed their VIP lounge, etc. Everything was good to go and I was stoked! I created invitations, secretly invited guests, and planned how it would all go down.

I arrived at SG approximately 30-45 minutes prior to the time I asked the guests to gather, so I would have time to set up and ensure everything was in order. I informed someone at the bar that I had reserved the VIP lounge. She responded with a gentleman's name and I said no, while confused. She said she would check with the manager, but that she may have seen the wrong name. I waited for a couple minutes next to the VIP lounge when the manager came to speak to me. He informed me that another individual had reserved the lounge and that the information showed that I reserved a dining area on the left side of the bar. I urged that there must have been a mistake because I specifically asked for the VIP lounge and I was told that it was available when I paid last month. He explained that what I described was impossible since the lounge had been reserved months in advance. WTF. I lost it. 

The next few lines are everything I, angrily, told the manager. I could not believe that someone was idiotic enough to provide me terrible information and created a false reservation. I'm certain that someone, if not that person, discovered the error along the way and didn't even think of contacting me about the change! If I knew I was reserving a dining area, I would never have been okay with making a deposit AND more importantly, if their lounge wasn't available, I would have gone somewhere else. It was extremely inconsiderate, especially knowing the importance of the event we were celebrating. I was devastated. I had this beautiful party planned and Ruben had absolutely no idea what was going on. His closest friends had already started arriving while this was happening and it was almost time for the party, so finding another location was not an option. Of course, all I wanted to do was leave. Nothing could undo what had been done. I was infuriated.

As horrible as the evening began, everyone was extremely accommodating and kind. The manager happily refunded my $40 deposit when I requested it and when I finally decided to stay, he said that they would take care of us - they ended up comping one of our H/H pizzas ($10) on our $28 bill. He was also apologetic and our server was really attentive. Therefore, I commend these individuals for trying to salvage the night. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now but only during lunch hour - and the place has been pretty dead every time.  That's a sign usually, but I can only imagine that there aren't more people because its smack in the middle of the day.  Maybe I'll venture here for dinner some night soon, if I can tear myself away from Hot Rods down the street.

I can't really complain about my visits, as the food has always been good and the servers are friendly.  The menu is very extensive, so take a minute to read it through.  I recommend the chicken parmesan sandwich or the chicken salad sandwich - both of which are very good.  The sliders aren't bad either and the chicken rice soup they offer is tasty.

I like the fact the place centers around the bar and has plenty of TVs to watch while you eat.  Makes getting away from the office for lunch that much more appealing.

But don't show up here with $10 and expect to eat though...my last lunch of soup, sandwich and soda was $20 with tip.  UGH."}
{"text":"This is obviously one of my regular hangouts. It's close to home, so it's my favorite late night spot. Excellent service & food. My favorite server is Christy, who is super sweet & beautiful.  My favorite bartenders are Brady & Alex. Prices are reasonable & they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is a nice local's sports bar with food and gambling. This place is very clean and obviously newly remodeled. The bar area is very large, and they also have a separate room for dining and events. The staff was very friendly, and made a very classy drink for a locals bar. They do have a specialty cocktail menu, and they also run half off pizzas on happy hour. The pizzas are on the large side, make sure you have someone to share. The pizza was thin crust and not bad for bar pizza. I tried the Italian pizza, I did enjoy the variety of toppings."}
{"text":"This is a really nice bar chain with exceptional customer service, gaming and food. It has a bit more of an upscale feel in comparison to other bars yet still just as laid back and enjoyable. The prices on alcohol and food are also very fair, this is a good place to relax and watch the Knights game or just hangout with friends or family."}
{"text":"Happy hour and nfl specials are great!  Half off beer and pizza from 5-7pm. The Gilroy is a favorite. 
Most of the staff is great!  A few of them are a bit snobbish."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch...food was decent, but the service was terrible. Took about 45 min to get our food once we ordered and it wasn't even busy. Also not good for small kids since they do not have high chairs available."}
{"text":"Not for families.  Came here w my parents and atbthebtime my 2 year old daughter. They had no kids menu...ok fine its a pub but also had no high chairs or boosterss. So i had to sit her in ny lap. Anyone w a child kbiws that doing anything w a kiddo on your lap is hard esoecailky eating...gots love those grubby lil hands smashing your food."}
{"text":"I have been here since 500pm.  It's almost 630pm.  Food order taken one hour after I got here.  The waitress just came by.  She forgot my order.  So we have to place the order again. Never coming back. By the way the beers are $20."}
{"text":"Decent wings, but they were a bit dry. Great for groups as a bunch of us were able to have a corner too ourselves."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but it has gone downhill a long way.  Went for lunch on Saturday, place was almost empty, yet the waitress managed to stay hidden constantly.  The service was horrible.  The portions overall were small, you only get 4 potato skins with an order and they were cold.  The nachos were good.  The sandwiches were small and they skimped on the fires.  Overall, a poor dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night and it was good! Just ordered a beer and the bartenders were really friendly. I even overheard her talking to some people at the bar about taking Uber because they seemed to be a little buzzed. Would definitely like to come again to stay a bit longer and try the food!"}
{"text":"The girly drink I had was sooooo good! 

I would pick Sierra Gold over Blue Martini any day! Half off pizzas and drinks for $3? Im game!"}
{"text":"Wow! I thought the food was expensive until I just realized I paid $8.75 for a mini-glass of bloody mary. And let's bring it back to food...half of my chicken wings were bloody! I pointed it out to the waitress. Any discount, future discount? No. But a nice apology. First and last time here. Beautiful place. Loud (football night)...to be expected. But drink/food price and quality...? No thanks! Too bad, close to home. And btw guys, I am not a complainer! This is the first time I have ever left a negative post or review on a place..kinda thinking about not following through. Here I go..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times while in Las Vegas. The food is good and the menu large. The help is okay and service depends on which side of the bed they woke up on. I have had super nice to short and curt. Nothing horrible but I'm always at a quandary to let management know when service suffers. I usually always cut them a break and know that they can improve. It won't stop me eating there but consistency would be nice."}
{"text":"THis place has really lost so much fuel for me. I used to pump it up to those I knew who put it down. not anymore. If you cant beat them join them. j/k. 
Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, not 15, hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes. My guess was b/c I dont have a pair ... well the pair the waitresses are looking for to get big \"tips\" from. 
The sadest part, the manager looked me in the eye, 2x. and never even asked what I'd like to order. you can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed (she's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks. 
I told my bf who loves this place, to count me out - he now sees it the light and started going bk to Rum Runner and Apache Joe's. 

The service at apache joe's is far more courteous.. not always consistently the same people but at least the girl bartenders notice you are there!!!"}
{"text":"I met up with some friends of friends at this cozy place. Before entering I had no idea it was a part of the \"PTS\" chain . Basically it is a fancier version. We got to enjoy Happy Hour from 5-8pm on a Sunday with 50% off Pizzas and drinks . The food was actually really decent for the price and the Service was EXCELLENT. My biggest issue was the fact the bartender never took a card for a tab so basically my friend and  I ended up getting toasted and having a huge bill that we had to try to allocate fees. It would of been a lot easier seeing as we were two females for him to ask if we wanted separate checks or together. We were sitting at the bar with a large group. The one thing to his credit was if you don't have their rewards card you get $5 off your bill so it brought my total down to like 80$ so that was exciting. Don't forget to ask about that if you go in!! Honestly it is a Glorified PTS but the vibe is really nice and the staff is super friendly... I give it four stars because I would go back again...and probably spend the same if not more money and still have a good time. To me if a Bartender is friendly it makes the world of difference but if the whole staff is HAPPY it proves they love their job and want to work for their tips so definitely had a good time!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to here for a good cocktail, plus it's close to my house. Came in for a dirty martini after a night on the strip. Received again excellent service from the bartenders (Brady & forgot the tall blonde haired guy). They make the drinks on point & they are super quick. Very hospitable & checked on everyone at the bar. They also remember us coming there. Great guys!!! 

Atmosphere was nice. Not smoky at all. Great lighting in there. I also love their comfy bar stools. I like the nice touches throughout the place, with the art on ceiling & nice & intimate VIP section. Makes it more modern. 

As far as food, I really like their buffalo ranch pizza a lot. The have a really yummy pazookie dessert."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this place lived up to the hype  a few of my friends told me about.

The inside of this place was pleasing to the eye, and it was very clean. We received good service, and the customer base was relaxed and laid back. 

Everyone there was just kicking back and having a good meal.

Which brings me to the food itself. I had some fish and chips and I have to say they were amongst the best I have ever had. They were delicious and it was a very reasonable serving.

If you haven't checked this place out, stop by and have a meal and a drink....you won't be disappointed.

I went to the Aliante location by the way."}
{"text":"Debbie is the most amazing server there is at sierra golds! We only want to be here when she is present so I hope that you all get the chance to experience her amazing service!!"}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been to Sierra Gold and decided to give it a try since it is around the corner. It is a great place if you want to have drinks, watch sports and smoke cigarettes and enjoy some bar food.

I have asthma so I am limited to restaurants that allow smoking. I asked the server if there was a non smoking area and was directed to the designated area. The filtration is ok but two hours later I began to cough and my clothes smelled of smoke when I arrived home. I realize that taverns want to cater to the smoking crowd so I will not return to this establishment due to the air quality.

The food was ok, we ordered the wing bucket that included fries and they were good, however the fries were over salted and I attempted to rub some off on the plate. I am not sure if the sauce on the wings were salty or the salting of the fries landed on the wings. My friend wanted to order a beer and apparently there is no list and the server had to recite the selection. A beer list is nice so one can peruse the choices instead of being put on the spot to order. The majority of people would not be able to recite the selection if they decided to order a second.

While my friend was in the restroom I requested the check and paid for the meal and included the tip, the server was great and made this happen without my friends knowledge. When I went to the bathroom she asked my friend if we wanted another drink as she was ending her shift and another server would be taking care of our table. My friend decided to tip her, she did not mention I had already paid and tipped her. She was tipped $13 for a $24 dollar meal. There was no excuse, so unprofessional. 

The Happy Hour is not worth it unless you like pizza, that is the only food item offered, drinks are 50% off. I am gluten intolerant and they do not have a gluten free pizza which I understand, but there are no Happy Hour options for me.

I will personally not return, but if a neighbor asked me where they could have a drink, smoke and play pool I will refer them to Sierra Gold. It is a great place to watch sports with their large screen TV's"}
{"text":"By far one of the friendliest bars I've come across. I was greeted when I walked in and served by not 1, but 2 great people at the same time! I ended up getting my usual blue moon and one of their burgers. I was surprised at how good their burger was! So flavorful and juicy! I recommend getting it. The atmosphere is nice as well, considering it is a bar. I like how the seats are setup to see every TV needed :)"}
{"text":"Very nice bar with great customer service, good drinks, n the food is to die for....I've been here maybe 3 times now n everything I've ordered was delicious!! 

They have 3 different happy hours, 6am-10am, 4pm-7pm, n 12am-3am....1/2 off drinks n pizza, the 6am happy hour is 1/2 off all breakfast items n who doesn't like a great cheap breakfast?! 

I love coming here cuz it's away from the strip so no overly drunk college kids just screaming away. The crowd is mixed of young n old n the service u get is friendly n fast."}
{"text":"Great Service!  For Serious!  They greet you as soon as you walk in, choose your own seat, and they will be there in a few to get you all set up.  Cool atmosphere, lots of TVs with Sports and decent music and videos. We have been here only three times and had the same waitress two of those times.  We went back the second time and she remembered our orders and was quick to bring it!  Happy Hour ROCKS from 4 to 7 with half off of EVERY DRINK.  Yes... EVERY drink if you are a Beer n Bites member as well as half off every pizza.  And the Pizza is pretty darn good!  I love the Gilroy... Yum.  the Beer n Bites card is a good deal as it costs only $5 and they take $10 off your first order... so it is a no brain-er.    Perfect neighborhood happy hour hang out.  I see much of our money going to this establishment... sigh.. so bitter sweet!"}
{"text":"Went to Sierra Gold tonight and waited 10 min for the bartender to even acknowledge us and then another 15 min passed and she never came to take our order so we moved to the dining room where the server came right over and was very attentive. We are regulars there and it always takes the bartenders forever to acknowledge we're there, even when it's not busy, like tonight. The females need a lot of work."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! ESP with the card, 1/2 off! The waitress is very friendly as well. I always come here for HH never breakfast, but I was blown away! Omelet is flavorful and the potatoes really awesome too!"}
{"text":"I come here on Thursday mornings for a networking meeting. We use the private room,which is nice for this type of meeting. Not the normal board room tables and chairs. This room has la casual livingroom feel. Good breakfast food,  large portions, fast  friendly service. 

Location is good, for those of us who live in the NW. Plenty of parking. Plan on coming back to try lunch and dinner soon!"}
{"text":"We showed up on a Thursday evening and the place was relatively empty. Despite that, the service was pretty slow and they messed up on two orders.  They forgot the cheese on my burger and gave the wrong type of fries to someone else at my table. The waitress was at least very apologetic. As far as the food went, it was delicious! The burgers were great, just a bit overcooked. They have all the pieces of the puzzle, but have yet to put them together correctly. I'll give them another try and see if I change my rating."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and apps with a group of friends. This place is very spacious so it can hold large parties. A plus if you want a really casual bar space to hold events. 

One waitress was serving our large groups so water cups were not refilled and I had to ask a couple times. We ordered two pizzas, two buckets of chicken wigs and some quesadillas. The pizza was not good. There was a lot of cheese but it wasn't gooey, the sauce had no flavor, and the crust was meh.  Dominos is better. The quesadillas were ok too. What you would expect from a causal bar. Their bone in chicken wings were super good though!  It's fried crispy and juicy. They also come with a plethora of dipping sauces so you can have many different flavors. I think the best sauces were the thai chili and ranch."}
{"text":"My family and I had a huge surprise birthday party planned for my uncle at a local park.  As the day came closer, we realized that the weather was probably going to be terrible; therefore, we were trying to scramble for a new location to host a party with 50+ guests with 2 days notice.  I had been to Sierra Gold a couple times in the past and had seen their upstairs room.  I thought I'd give the restaurant a call to see what they had available.  After talking to the manager, Tami, I found out that we could have the room for the exact time we were looking for!  Not only that, but Tami felt so bad for us because we had already purchased all our food, so she gave us a rockin' discount!  It's nice to know that there are still business people out there who care about people and not just the $$.  I will definitely start making Sierra Gold one of my regular spots simply because Tami was so great.  Oh yeah, and our waitress, Shurine, was by far super helpful!  Even though she was the only one attending us, she was on top of everything!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a lot, especially for happy hour 1/2 price drinks starting at midnight. I love the spicy honey BBQ wings, zookie, chicken nachos, and the mango red pepper drink. Homer and Warren are the best bartenders!! All of the staff has been very friendly to us in our experiences."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast, which is half price until 10AM. Our eggs, omelette and potatoes were cooked to perfection. Nice ambiance and servers were refilling and checking on us regularly. A great breakfast at a fantastic price, in a cool environment. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of all Sierra Gold/PT locations.  They have great specials and although you are able to smoke there, it's not a smokey place at all.  

Tonight we visited this place to finish off the birthday extranvaganza.  Our server was Rachel.  She was super sweet and made our experience tonight, a good one!  It was awesome that she had our best interest in mind.  For instance, I ordered a vodka soda with a lime.  She said that for $0.50 more, you can get Belvedere vodka instead of the well brand.  

We also got the italian sausage pizza for $16.99 (half off after midnight).  There was a lot sausage on the pizza, and the crust was thin and crunchy.  Always a fan.  Topped with ranch and I've got a great meal.  

To end my birthday extranvaganza, Rachel bought our whole table Washington Apple shots.  Every place I've been this weekend has given me a nice birthday surprise, and Sierra Gold was no different.  Thanks for a wonderful end to my birthday extranvaganza!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here & I must say, not bad.. Not bad at all. The waitress was consistent.. Checked in pretty frequently which was nice. The food.. It was pretty good. Probably the only reason why I gave this review 4 stars was because the Philly Cheesesteak I ordered would have been more complete with green & red peppers. Aside from that, everything was great! The atmosphere was cool & the drinks, even though on special (everyday between 5-7pm & 12-2am), they were strong! So its definitely worth it! I would come back, especially because they have a 24 hour breakfast menu! YUM!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar... catch me here like everyday!

I wish I could try everything on the menu but I only have like a top 10 favorites of what I reorder each time I get food. Their bloody mary's and drinks are off the hook. Super strong, and cheap, just the way I like them. Their happy hour is also great if I ever make it on time. I definitely totally vouch for their food. It isn't greasy nasty bar food.... it actually is quality and reasonably priced. 

Sitting at a table is a bit of a hassle because the 2000 britney spears & justin timberlake denim-blingy belt wearing waitresses take FOREVER, have a bad attitude always (not one is friendly to me the 3 years I've been coming here), and ignore me. I recommend sitting at the bar for the best service. The bar tenders are always a great time. They make sure my thirst is quenched, give me water whenever I've had one too many, and comp my drinks whenever I gamble. I SWEAR I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. It is a hit or miss but I usually break even or win 40$ on Keno. 

I love you Sierra Gold! Thank you for making me poor."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in town to pop in for a drink after work, watch a sports game, or just simply hang out. The food is bomb especially the pizzas and the fries. The happy hour is also great. The only reason I would give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the smoking. I know that they might be allowed to smoke by law but if one person lights up a cigarette it stinks up the entire place. I definitely leave the bar smelling like ashtrays :)

The bartenders are all very friendly especially Brady who is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I usually go here during happy hour. 5-7pm & 12am-2am half price pizzas and drinks. Food & service here for the most part has been decent on my visits here. Their happy hour used to be 3hrs twice a day but they cut it down from 5-8pm & 12-3am back in September. Sometimes it does take a bit to catch someone's attention. Surprisingly decent food for a bar.  Their Gilroy pizza is the bomb! Thin crust white garlic sauce pizza with salami, pepperoni, artichokes, onions, tomatoes & mushrooms. During happy hour large 16\" pizzas are half priced at $10. I would eat here on ocassion after work if it coincided with happy hour."}
{"text":"Egh.
This is supposed to be a \"nicer\" version of PT's, when actually it's probably better described as the \"dirty ass basement of PT's, but large!\"
My beer was warm and our waitress was a total rude ass. The place was messy and there was food and crap all on the floor, it made me lose my appetite so we didn't even bother ordering anything. Which was a good call, cause even though it was happy hour, the waitress charged us full price for our drinks, so we would of for everything else too I'm sure. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"After a night of chillin' like a villain, my tummy was ready for some steak fillin'.  Hmm where to go for a steak and egg that's under $7?  I only knew Tuscany as one serving a good plate but luckily I was with a friend who brought me here instead.

This place is like an upgraded cleaner version of PT's.  Cheap food and drinks after 12pm and conveniently right off the 215.  Man their cookies and ice cream on top is off the shizzle my nizzle and steak and eggs weren't bad either.  Heard good things about their pizzas too but I could only eat so much in one night.  This is definitely my new grub spot after a long night at Town Square.

And it looks like a good place to watch sports too in the daytime. Plenty of flatscreens around the bar area."}
{"text":"I am always here during football season to watch my Patriots play since a lot of my games aren't show on local TV. Jan (my bartender) is amazing. Always really attentive and a good time and the food here isn't what  you would expect. In addition to the normal bar fare you also have some culinary masterpieces. Try the pizzas you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Way under staffed for happy hour. I sat with a menu for 20 minutes and no order taken. Even after I let my server know I was ready, another 10'minutes had passed. I get keeping over head costs down, but wow. Lost a customer for life don't go hungry. Trying to close out my tab took another half hour. I asked for the check and a box twice. Another bartender came in around 7 but he was of very little assistance.  This is probably the worst service I have ever had. Sad really because the food is decent."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out & drink. It's a PT's property, so they have the same amazing Happy Hour specials beginning at midnight.
Half-Priced pizzas are the bomb!
If Homer is there, ask him to hook you up with a custom cocktail & some betting picks, he's the best!
Good prices on big draft beers. Decent prices on cocktails. Cute female bartenders in sexy leather vests."}
{"text":"Good food if you are willing to give up your first born child.  Drinks are only comped when playing $1.25 bets.  Female bartenders are rude.  Been here three times and each time am reminded why I don't come back."}
{"text":"Homer is the best!! 

These 5 stars are for him & that Gilroy pizza!! 

My husband and I are bummed out everytime we go and find out Homer isn't there! He treats all the customers as if they were best buds!"}
{"text":"Nice place to watch the game. Plenty of TVs without having to sit at the bar. Staff was friendly and helpful. The drinks were good, and the chicken tacos were okay."}
{"text":"Great 24 hour spot and nice for games. Clean and comfortable with good service."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 10 years , during the last two years I have noticed a difference in the service and the food  has deteriorated . I used to boast about this place , not any more the food quality has gotten poor not worth the price and is either under cooked or greasy . The bartenders are 90% female who have obviously not been trained in customer service and just expect to be tipped for just being there . ( occupation ornaments) . Your just gonna stay thirsty ..... Good luck trying to get there attention ."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is a dressed up PT's and what's not to love? During Happy Hour (3-7 PM) pizzas and drinks are half off. The pizzas are actually fabulous (thin crust) and the big mugs of cold icy beer are dirt cheap. The atmosphere here is actually pretty nice, but I have to admit as a lady the overly sleezy waitress outfits and obnoxious art is a turnoff . I see so much sleeze here in town, it would be nice to have just an ounce of class in a local's bar! This particular SG location is one of my favorites because it is so freaking well located. It's not all that far from anywhere - Spring Valley, Summerlin, SW, Henderson, etc . It's kind of a default meet up spot when we have groups coming from all over the valley. Easy on/off freeway access from everywhere!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite watering hole. Recently raised beer prices and now beers are 2$ more. Wish they hadn't. No longer gambling here. Now only coming for happy hour."}
{"text":"Since this location is right down the street from our house, it's an easy choice. However since they redid their menu, very disappointed with each choice. Always a huge fan of the pretzel bites! Incredibly disappointed last night with the Golden Chicken tenders. We ordered the bucket of 16 for $26 since it was a better deal than the 4 Piece for $12. Way more crunchy bread than chicken. It hurt our teeth to eat more than 2 tenders each! When I flagged down the waitress to ask why they were so crunchy, she said she was new and would ask if it was a new recipe. And of course never came back until we flagged her down for the check.  We left incredibly disappointed and hungry. What a waste of $51! Could have gone to so many better restaurants for that price. Besides their pretzel bites, sad to say I doubt we will be coming back to this location soon, or recommending it anymore."}
{"text":"My favorite bar and grill.  It's located in a very popular location just south of Aliante Parkway and Clark County 215.  It's a clean facility and the staff are awesome.   If you want hot food, i.e. pizza, fries, etc, this is the place for you if you don't want to drive into downtown Vegas.  Gilroy pizza is highly recommended by the way.  It will change your opinion  of pizzas forever.   Go there and have an open mind."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold's is owned by the vast enterprise that is PT's. Compared to your standard PT's or Sean Patrick's bars, Sierra Gold's is more upscale. It's just down the street from Aliante Casino and largely caters to the male military crowds. What I like about Sierra Gold's is that 90s rock music videos are streamed alongside your usual sports events. Heck yes to Nirvana!

The exact same famous PT's Happy Hour is offered at Sierra Gold. 12AM - 2PM and 5PM - 7PM will get you 50% off drinks and pizza with select $5 apps. From 6AM - 10PM, you can also get half off breakfast items. 

I ate at Sierra Gold's for breakfast for the first time recently, and won't come back for my morning meals. The breakfast was definitely easy on the wallet, with 4 of us dining for about $32. The quality of the food was disappointing though...

THICK SLICED FRENCH TOAST ($6.99): Zero flavor. Three slices of french toast but any hint of the powdered sugar, maple syrup, and cinnamon was just not detectable. 2/5

MINER\"S BREAKFAST ($7.99): This was supposed to be their 'specialty'. A skillet with eggs, potatoes, sausage, ham, peppers and onions. Poor presentation and a VERY small portion of food. 2/5

SIERRA GOLD PLATTER ($7.99): 3 eggs with choice of bacon, sausage, or ham. The meat items come with 3 pieces. For some reason, they refused to do half orders?? So if you ask for bacon and sausage they'll say nope, you can only pick one. :/ Comes with a side of toast. 3/5

Worth a Return Visit?
Skip breakfast here but come for drinks during Happy Hour! The service is better than most PT owned bars and the bathrooms are clean and way fancier. Sierra Gold's is a solid local's bar to chill at.

{"text":"This is a very warm and classy bar with excellent food and ambience.  They have a semi private space for get togethers and a very responsive and professional staff. Dawn Ressler is the contact person and she is very helpful and accommodating. 
She downloaded a pic I sent with a drink recipe and made sure it was available for my guests.   If you book the room they will even assign your own server -- ours was Kiki and she was awesome.  I'm fortunate to live nearby and it's a great place to go for happy hour or a bite any time.  The happy hour pizza deal is one of the best in town.  Extremely impressed."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service ! Be prepared to wait for a long time busy or not!"}
{"text":"This place has HORRIBLE service.  They don't even deserve a serve a star!  And if you have a crowd in the place of under thirty why are you playing music from the 60's!"}
{"text":"Food was better than expected. Customer service was great considering they only had two people. The two ladies were very attentive and helpful. Can get rather pricey though if you're not drinking the drinks that are on special.  Will definitely return. If nothing else because they have Stella on draft. LOL"}
{"text":"Happy hour 5pm - 7pm and 12am - 2am every day. Half off all pizzas and all drinks. This is one of those places where everybody knows your name. Hands down one of my favorite places in town. The staff is always friendly and the location is ideal. Located right outside of Desert Shores this area needed a regular local 'watering hole'. Their golden rewards card offers great text offers on a regular basis. Just the other day I received a BOGO offer on entrees. A few days before that I recieved an offer for a free pitcher of beer. 

The atmoshpere is always up beat. TVs every where make it a place where there is no bad seating. Just like in any other gaming pub, smoking is allowed but you'd never know it here. Their state of the art ventilation system is awesome and this is coming from someone who has a sensitive nose for cigarette smoke. The cooks are always on point. My favorite is the steak and eggs with sweet potato fries. Breakfast is served 24/7. They never have an attitude when you have to turn back food which I have never had to do but a friend of mine did and they got his order turned around quickly. 

The lighting and sound is just right. Not too dark, and not to bright. Not too loud and not low that you can hear everyone else's conversation. They have separate room that is great for group gatherings. It has a wall lines with TVs together that can be made into one huge screen. The price and atmosphere is right. The bathrooms are always very clean and stocked. There really isn't much more you can ask of from a local pub."}
{"text":"I went there last night for a small birthday party. When I went there I ordered from the bar during happy hour a regular beer which was fine. When I ordered from the cocktail waitress she informed me that happy hour was over and I was okay with that but she brought me a beer that I did not order that was probably the highest price beer on their menu. When I walk back to the bar to try to fix it I was ignored and I was told that the beers were the same price which they were not. I ordered a PBR which should have been around $7 and they ended up giving me a Ballast Point sculpin which was over $12, and they did not fix it for me. I would probably never go back there."}
{"text":"I love coming in on Sunday mornings while waiting for my table @ baby stacks next door or after midnight in Saturday's during happy hour. Nice location, great staff that I've met so far."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold gets a big fat 4 out 5 for their happy hour, the atmosphere, the decor, and the service.

I think the whole Nevada tavern concept is a true testament to Las Vegas locals and the home-y neighborhood that is this city.

Sierra Gold is right down the street from my house so I frequent this location quite a bit. I've had 2 different company parties here, and several department-wide happy hours as well.

FOR LARGE PARTIES, this place is quite accommodating. The large \"living room\" was perfect for space for events with 10-20 people. We reserved the space for a department Holiday party in under 3 weeks notice for a $20 fee. The space was perfect for the par-tay peeps under 30 years old and had just enough elegance to make our VP comfortable with his cufflinks and cognac.

SG's menu is quite extensive. Plus their monthly specials are always worth a try. 50% off pizza and drinks for happy hour 7 days a week is probably worth all 5 stars.... On days when I need to eat my feelings, I have to order a buffalo chicken pizza (aka Chicken ranch) and..... the GILROY!!! I am sad they eliminated their size variety and only offer what most would consider a large - but the gilroy tastes just as good as leftovers (not the Buffalo one though - not good reheated).

More times than not, SG & their sister PT's have half off breakfast specials,,,, This used to be a big win for my husband and myself because we were\are huge fans of their breakfast pizza...but they reformulated the menu about a year or so back and it's just not as great - it's good still but not as great. Darn. R.I.P old SG breakfast pizza.

I have a friend that gripes about the bartenders and their \"uniforms\" or as she calls it \"boobtenders\".... lol.. but I mean, really?! it doesn't bother me - to be honest - I've lived in this town for 10+ years... I see more cleavage at Smith's."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and happy hour from 12am to 2am! Our bartender let us put in an order before the happy hour ended, which I thought was very kind on her part. Other Sierra golds that I have been to would not have done the same."}
{"text":"I like this place! A little more \"luxurious\" than your run-of-the-mill PT's, but not \"stuffy\". The interior is well lit for a bar - not too dark; not too bright. The service was excellent considering there were a ton of people there celebrating my friend's birthday. The drinks were accurately mixed, and the bar food is better than most. There's tons of seating. Huge downside: super smokey, but I guess I should expect it. I may also be putting it on more of a pedestal than I should since it was my first night out alone since having a baby, LOL. Either way, I'll be back on a night that I'm baby-less."}
{"text":"I've been to Sierra Gold about three times now. The first was for a friend's birthday get together. The second was for a football game. The third was for food and a football game. 

Shots are cheap during late nights. 

Beers are pretty cheap all year around. I usually get a blue moon and that's about $5 for a 16oz. Or $5 for a giant miller lite during football games.

Food is decent. Nothing horribad. Nothing astonishingly great. They have a happy hour menu and a football happy hour menu. 

What I do love is that it's not crowded as heck during football games and finding a seat is not like finding a needle in a haystack. My boyfriend and I were there this past Sunday for the afternoon game and it was really easy to find a table with a TV right in front of us. Speaking of TVs, they have plenty. They have different games on different TVs so it's not a team specific bar. However, I do believe Niner Nation is here. They rent out a certain area of the bar and that's where they usually are for the Niner games. It's all good -- I'm all in for the Niners as well. 

The only downside to it is that the service is super slow. There is usually only 1-2 waitresses for the whole sitting area. They take a while to get your orders down but the food is generally really quick to come out...probably because the food isn't brought to you by the waitress. 

Overall, it's a pretty nice bar. It would definitely be the place to go for me to watch some football games. Also, get their rewards/players card. You get $5 credit the day you sign up so $5 off your orders yay!"}
{"text":"Kaitlyn was my server, and she gave me the greatest experience ever! Happy hour is awesome with half drinks and half off pizza, I recommend the Gilroy."}
{"text":"Happy Hour 5-7pm Monday thru Friday.   Good $5 food specials and great beer specials!

Top items to eat is the Lemmon Pepper Chicken Wings and the messy tots!   During games there is a bunch of game specials."}
{"text":"We had marked them off the list,  and decided to give them another try to watch a game.  It took a little while to get the formula right, but now they're on track.  The really, really awful and annoying bartender is gone; now Matt & Tino take excellent care of us.  Yesterday when I visited Matt had my favorite drink in my hand before I sat down.  

The food has improved as well, up to the standard of Jones/215."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is one of the best neighborhood bars.  They give me the VIP treatment every time we visit; a couple of the girls even remember my name.  Their food selection is fantastic.  When Steve, I think he's the bar manager, is there things do tend to run much more smoothly.  If you are a player, they really do take great care of you.

Love the calamari & thin crust pizzas.  They offer the pizza @ 50% off for happy hour from 5-7.  Generous portion of nachos that is difficult to finish.  Good bloody marys - they have their own mix.  You would be surprised at how difficult it is to find good bloody marys around here.

I always have much more fun at SG than I expected.  Good food, good service, & I frequently get lucky @ video poker here."}
{"text":"Good place to come watch a game.. but high price drinks and dry tasteless food. They have a drink special which is wild turkey for 6.50.. you can buy a bottle for 18. We ordered the ghost pepper cheese quesadilla and eggs benedict. The quesadilla had no flavor and was not even remotely hot ... ghost peppers? The eggs benedict was put together well but had literally no hollandaise sauce which resulted in a super dry meal that was hard to eat. The communication between guest and server was almost nonexistent.  The decoration on the inside gave a modern mixed with cowboy vibe. I would not recommend this place even slightly as there are lots of bars in Vegas that are far superior."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of local bars in the area and this is one of the few that has great gaming, food, and bartenders who are knowledgeable in cocktails.  The music does not quite match the demographic that goes to the bar, and it often times has the TV's around the bar showing the news, or old VH1 music videos playing, while a different song plays through the speakers of the bar but, this is not enough to steer you away from this place. Great selection of food, great seating. Whether its at the bar or one of their booths around the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's now been two years and still going strong. Love Homer and the graveyard crew. 

I recommend the fish tacos, the tuna poke, the cuban sliders, wings and the pizzas. 

Can't say I love their slots because I don't win but I love their environment."}
{"text":"I was very surprised that this was a Sierra Gold.  It used to be a steak house, but is far better suited for a pub.  Went on a Friday after work and it had a nice size crowd.  Good happy hour.  We had the 3 different pizzas which were ok for premade dough.  The service seems to be up and down.  Will be back as it is not too far from home."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as a neighborhood bar since I live so close that I could walk to it. My review is based off a few visits and all have been negative. 2 stars for the food, which was ok, but the service SUCKS! I've sat at the bar with my fiance on a date night and we were ignored by the female bartender to the point where another bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ask if we would like another round. It was so ridiculous! The bar wasn't even busy and this bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ignore us and stay at the other end if the bar. We each had 2 drinks and decided that the crappy service wasn't worth our business and left! We won't be back!

If you are a bartender that works at Sierra Gold and wonder why you have ever gotten a bad tip: it's because you gave horrible service! Acknowledge all your customers - it's your job to represent Sierra Gold and make sure people feel welcome. If you are not smart enough to figure out that this is how you make money in tips and don't care then just quit because you are hurting the business that you work for!"}
{"text":"The day staff has always been friendly and accommodating.  However, when I went with some co-workers on a Friday night for reverse happy hour, I had the exact opposite experience.  The staff seemed as if they wanted us to leave, and that they did not want to be bothered.  No one in the group was being demanding,  we were just trying to buy drinks every now and again.  
Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they could have just been having a bad night.  I'll still give them another shot."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of work colleges, wasn't my choice of places to eat but excited to try something new. It was seat yourself and the first thing I noticed was that the place smelled like cigarettes, not uncommon for Vegas but a pet peeve of mine in an eating establishment.

Our waitress greeted us fairly quickly but only brought 5 menus for 6 people. We got our drinks right away and she did a good job at keeping them full. The food took what seemed like a long time, especially considering that they only had a couple other patrons. I ordered the Cobb Salad as did the gal to my right. We were the first to get our food but they failed to bring us any salad dressing. We waited for others to get their food and the next 3 dished all came out together. The final dish (a bbq chicken salad) didn't come out at all. We finally had to flag down our server because the one salad was missing and 2 were still missing their dressing.

The food was good but not great. I liked the shredded romaine lettuce for my Cobb Salad, vs. the usual iceberg. A girl in our party had the Fajita Wrap and said it was just meh... but another scarfed down his French Dip, and the guy who only ordered the soft pretzel didn't leave anything behind either.

As with many places when it came time to get the check it seemed to take longer than necessary. I honestly was just surprised at the slow service over all because of the lack of people there - there seemed to be plenty of staff.

I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again if I'm not in a hurry. But it won't be a place I'll ever recommend."}
{"text":"Been coming here on the weekends (either Saturday or Sunday morning) for the last three months and today's service was beyond horrible. Typically this is the place to get a reasonably priced breakfast without having to go inside a casino, but today is making me reconsider that endorsement. 
While we tend to come around nine, today we arrived before 8 and that will never happen again. Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive and when it did it was lukewarm and incorrect. The manager on duty didn't seem to be too concerned that the table that sat down after us got their food before us and had almost finished eating before she could tell us they were almost done cooking our food. I have a food allergy and need everything cooked in a pan with butter than on the grill but usually this does not add to wait time - today this was the reason it took so long according to the manager.
They did correct the incorrect dish (home fries ordered crispy and came out barely cooked) but did so by taking off the eggs and heating up the original home fries. This took five minutes and by then they topped the hot home fries with the cold eggs. The manager stated three times she would bring more decaf coffee but never did - thankfully another waitress did. To top it off the corrected dish had an additional garnish of a strand of hair. 
The attitude of the manager on duty only made this visit worse. She should focus on bartending because her managerial skills lack empathy and concern for the upset guest."}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge quantities. A little pricey, but worth even more.  Nicely setup fora pub. Had the 10\" high sandwich the first time, shared it with my friend and still took half of it home. This time the best thin pizza, not crispy except the edge, and really tasty.  Of course more leftovers, and my friend did quite well on the poker machine.  Great food, friendly waitress.....enjoy!"}
{"text":"We got Sloppy tots which was the best part of the meal. I also ordered the filet with veggies and a side salad. The veggies were mushy. The salad was pretty good. The filet was surprisingly cooked the way I asked and it was tender. 


The service is absolutely terrible. So if you come here, don't expect them to be attentive and you won't be upset.

I give it 2 stars because of the service and the food wasn't anything to rave about."}
{"text":"Date night at SG was a hit.  First we went to the Jones location and the customer service was terrible so we drove to Henderson.  Most locals think it's far, but actually not a bad drive at all.  The customer service was great.  We sat at the bar and played some games.  Our money got stuck and the bar tender quickly called a repair guy who came and opened the machine and gave us our money and we continued playing.   Now on to the food.... can I say sooooooo delicious! The portions were big well at least to me so I didn't finish it all and I was sharing with my husband.  The drinks were made to perfection and the other locals at the bar were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday and they bought him a Yeager and redbull.  He is not a big drinker, but he enjoyed the drink. All around 5 stars for customer service, location, and the other customers.  We went on my husband's birthday which was Feb. 22 and I must say we will be returning.  We live in summerlin, but we enjoy this location the most."}
{"text":"You know, I'm a little disappointed because I have been in this industry or associated with the industry since 1992 and I'm a little disappointed that loyalty doesn't go that far anymore and with this company... so to recap  I posted  a couple of weeks ago that I felt  I was not appreciate it  for my contribution and dedication to this bar... So I go back in to the bar a few days ago and  ask them why nobody has contacted me for the hockey games when I was promised a game in their box seats for being one of their top players in town and they were shocked that I was not called to go to the game that I was promised.... Then on top of it, I lost $1,500 in there that night and I still have not been called after be promised to be contacted yet again .. I guess players are no longer appreciated for their loyalty to a particular bar...."}
{"text":"Good steak salad, but I can get over the smoke.  To bad there's not a non-smoking section."}
{"text":"Happy hour - pizza & drink specials! 

Don't forget the garlic parmesan fries- soooo good!"}
{"text":"A bar only has a few minutes to make a good impression. This one lost it.  There were no seats at the bar, and the upper seating sections were closed off with signs \"wait to be seated.\"  we stood for about 3-4 minutes, and walked around looking for someone to seat us. Needless to say, we left. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bar and pretty good grub for bar food. It gets packed! I walked in on a Tuesday night around 1am and couldn't find a seat! You've been warned."}
{"text":"Rude to people with disabilities and unhelpful. They make you feel beneath them.  Will never go again or recommend.
Negative stars."}
{"text":"Great place for a fantasy draft. TV that you can plug your laptop into, private areas, great sexy waitresses, and above average food.(sliders and pizza and wings).  This is the upscale version of PT's and it shows."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is very good.  Half price beer & pizza during happy hour.  This is one of the few places that has arrogant bastard on draft."}
{"text":"So I was craving a hamburger - and I thought I would give this place a try.  I have to say for a chain bar and grill not known for food I was pleasently suprised...

They have a good happy hour with plenty of specials.  The 22 oz newcastles were only $3.50.  

The hamburger was a huge patty hanging way over the sides of the bun.  It had just the right amount of grease dripping out of the patty and most importantly it was plenty juicy!  That was a TASTY burger!  Craving satisfied!

Good spot to watch sports with plenty of TV's.

The women working there do wear revealing tops with their jugs totally popping out.  I'm just saying......"}
{"text":"This is like the other Sierra Golds.  The happy hour is probably your best option.  

The pizzas are half off for happy hour and all drinks are 50% off.  Of course they just raise the regular prices but atleast it is reasonably priced with the discount... you have to have a beer and bites card to get the discount.  That card does make your visit seem corporate and impersonable.  I guess Vegas has changed... \"sigh...\"

The pizzas are suprisingly good.  Not in the traditional pizza way - because the crust is more like a cracker than real pizza dough.  even though it is not tradional pizza it still tastes pretty good.  

This particular location seems busier than other Sierra Golds.  It had a pretty good crowd there - lively but not too lively."}
{"text":"So after coming back to Vegas after 8 years. I went to show my brother a good place to eat.  We examined a few different PT's and after some unpleasant experiences we ended up here.   We both ordered the half chicken and We were blown away with how good the food was. 

Now let's talk about Jessica and Daria, both phenomenal servers. Very attentive and friendly. The drinks were kept filled and the food was hot on delivery.  If you are a visitor or a local this is a place to stop in at."}
{"text":"So a while back, I had a semi not so good experience with this restaurant.  The lack of service was my issue, the first time in years a Sierra gold did not conform to my standards. 
Today I gave in and came back to see if it was just a hiccup or if I should just boycott it completely. 
Well, let's start with, I didn't even get the chance to walk up the steps before I  was greeted by Claudia
That was a great start to my experience.  As I am a creature of habit I always order the grilled chicken sandwich, add bacon minus onion. 
The sandwich came out piping hot with all the condiments just right.  
The server was the same server who greeted me at the steps.  
As I was unaccompanied, she made my experience enjoyable with the small talk above the normal server/guest conversation."}
{"text":"Had a small gathering of about 15 people here yesterday for my son who graduated from the North Las Vegas Fire Academy and became a Fireman. 
I can't say enough wonderful things about this place 
Rochelle was our waitress and she was just amazing we had ordered tons of food and drinks and everything was wonderful.  The chef was amazing 
If your in this area you should give Sierra Gold a try you won't be disappointed

Great Food 

Great Staff 

Loads of Fun"}
{"text":"When I just want to get away and get drunk with my friends and play some pool. We head down to Sierra gold. I know this place is the same company with Pts Pub. But something about this places atmosphere is pretty heart warming Becuase of their Cabin interior. Happy hour is usually runs to 12am-3am I believe ?  Good place to socialize and play some pool ! Had a great night with my friends here."}
{"text":"Went in at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Total ghost town. Nobody in this place. Terrible bar service, she seemed to be intentionally ignoring us. We asked for menus. The prices were outrageous for bar food. Who wants to pay double digits for a french dip type sandwich. 

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"It's 1 am and I could use a beer right now. Where should I go? Sierra Gold. It's basically a PT's but nicer (excluding PT's Gold).

It's down the street from my house so +1 for convenience. The service is curt and a quite slow at times, but I'm usually not in a hurry when I come here anyway. The waitresses really do like to take their time. They're always nice and friendly though, so no worries.

There are two happy hour times, 5-7pm and 12-2am, which includes half off drinks, half off pizzas, and $5 certain appetizers. The food is alright and good to share with friends while drinking. I'd recommend the miner's plate or pretzel bites ($5).

The venue itself is huge. Lots of room if you decide to bring a big group. Parking is ample and there are many TV screens to watch shows or games when you're here. However, there are no pool tables if that's what you're into.

All in all a good place to chill with some friends over beer any night of the week. Open 24/7 for all your alcoholic needs!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite to eat or even dinner. They also have a good Happy Hour. Campfire meatballs are on point. Ask for Tannie"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor of Sierra Gold for years and always had excellent service. However last night's service was so horrible that it makes me not want to go back. The waitress for our group (Nicole) was extremely rude with a very snotty attitude and snapped as us numerous times. We did have a large party and reserved a space, and she was by herself handling us, so I understand being frustrated, but as a person in the customer service industry the way she talked to us and treated us all night was completely unwarranted and unacceptable. Will definitely rethink before showing up there again...."}
{"text":"Loved coming here for breakfast. They used to have the BEST corned Beef and eggs, but they have changed their menu. I've tried a few of their new items for breakfast and lunch, some hits, some misses...the 4 stars are for the good wait staff and the Corned Beef breakfast - please bring it back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best kept secret for breakfast specials in Las Vegas. We stumbled upon this when we saw a long line filled with hopeless looking people going to Baby Stacks for breakfast. Definitely not in the mood to wait for breakfast and spied a half price breakfast special at Sierra Gold next door. 
What a find. Beautiful steakhouse decor. Smoke was not hanging in the air at that hour and adorable and friendly servers. Add a great steak and eggs for $5 during \"happy hours 6am-10am and it's all good. My spousal unit loves the chicken fried steak too. This place has become a weekly habit for us. Stop in for breakfast. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Yes, as others have pointed out, this is an upscale PTs.  What's wrong with that?  I love the look of the place.  The menu is large and the food good."}
{"text":"The food was good and decent portions. The best part of this place was our server, Mary. She was very friendly and on it, great service. I give her 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular but I have been coming here for years.  I've been here in large groups for celebratory outings, small groups for just hanging out, heck I've even met a one night stand here.  HA!

There are a lot of areas to sit and the bar is pretty large.  Be wary that if you sit in front of a machine but are not playing and someone wants to play on it, you will be asked to move.  I like sitting and playing at the machine because my drinks and most likely my food ends up being free.  Although losing money gambling isn't free...

The service can be iffy.  Sometimes you have to wait a bit for someone to acknowledge you, especially if you aren't sitting at the bar.  After you've placed an order (especially if it's just food) you may not see your server again for awhile.  

The food here is ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think that they are trying a bit too hard.  I like the idea of the menu and what they have on it but if you can't execute it properly then what's the point?  Just do straight up bar/diner food.  Example, the fish and chips are fish, shrimp, fries (or tater tots!!!) and hush puppies with coleslaw, tartar sauce and lemon.  If you want to get fancy with it like this then the fish better not be super soggy, the shrimp not over cooked and rubbery, the coleslaw have some flavor other than cut raw cabbage, and the lemons fresh and not thin and slimy.  

Given all that though I do think this is a nice place to do whatever activity you've chosen to do here."}
{"text":"Maybe 1 1/2 stars. I stopped in to watch Sunday Night Football. There are lots of TV screens throughout the establishment, but almost all were less than 40\" so its worse than watching at home. I sat down and was greeted nicely, my drink order filled, menu delivered. That's where the service stopped. No one came back to take a food order. No one stopped by to see how I was doing. My drink sat empty for almost 15 minutes before someone noticed. At that time I chose to settle my tab and go elsewhere. Don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Really decent specials during football. I had a nice cheeseburger and beer for $8. Service is always a little suspect here, and has been on a few occasions. Food is good though. Sadly the game was a blowout, Atlanta whipping up on Tampa Bay.

I'll be back because I do like certain items on the menu. Its an ok bar, just wish the bartenders were a little more friendly and a little quicker."}
{"text":"Been going here the last couple Sundays to watch Niner games with the Niner Nation, who reserves a room with a large screen TV. I've been a little late as I watch the morning games until conclusion to check my fantasy points, so the room has been packed and I get stuck at the bar. They are a friendly group of people so that's cool.

This review is for the bar itself, and the specials. $3 bloody mary's, coors light, and some other beer I will never drink. Food specials are only $4.99 cheeseburgers w/fries, chili cheese dog, or some fancy fries. I usually get the cheeseburger and its been OK. The bloody marys are pretty weak and pretty tame. Service is extremely busy, and so its hit or miss after you initially sit down and order. 

Overall, its a nice bar with a raised table seating area, a large bar with gaming, and a couple of rooms for groups. TV's everywhere so you won't miss any of the action. I'll be back for sure to root for my Niners, and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Erin has it going on!! Besides Kristie. She has the night or evening shift covered any different shirt coverage will be a wrong thing for mngt to do!!!  Happy hour with Kristie and Erin!"}
{"text":"I was weary of the service when I first walked in the waitress seemed annoyed. She drop menus down and walked away not saying a single word to us. They were bust but at least say hi. After things got better she was actually nice and helpful. Prices were ok... at least the drink prices were. Food prices kinda high. We ordered the pot stickers for the app and they were hands down the best. We followed it with salads and liked everything we got."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would! My husband and I got a pizza from here last night and now today (Easter Sunday) I am super sick. Horrible stomach ache, and yes it was the pizza cause I didn't eat anything else other than the pizza. So we definitely won't be back. Even my husband got sick but I got it worse than him."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice staff and menu is really is good so if your looking for cool hang out spot after work or to watch a sporting event this is good place for that."}
{"text":"Well, been a few years since I yelped and I still find myself hangin at Sierra Gold. Liked it so much that I recently recommended it for the Michigan State alumni bar when we needed to find a new home to root for our Spartan teams. We're a rowdy, fun bunch, especially when we have a cowbell to rock it to our \"Go State\" cheer.  But I'm sure the Gold can handle us.  Now I haven't just been sitting here for 3 years, took a little hiatus from the bar scene here and there, but nice to come back to a place where Charlie still knows my name :)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.
1. Homer the bartender
2. Staying in the suburbs of Vegas, getting into town at 1am and no food to be found. Anywhere.  
3. Happy hour between midnight and 4am? Half price drinks and pizza? I'm in heaven!

So on recommendation of the bartender at TGI Fridays that was closing up shop, we shot over to Sierra Gold for some much needed food after a day of traveling and layovers.  We get there and pull on the doors. Locked. GREAT now what. Wait you need to be buzzed in! Smart. The bartender informed us it was a security feature (obviously) and when you hit the buzzer to be buzzed in it automatically snaps a photo of you.

Anyways this place is GREAT.  Homer was fantastic, and made you feel like a local/regular. The food was awesome too. Together we all got, the steak, chicken tenders, buffalo wings and chicken fajita wrap.  All of which were delicious.  Homer happily sub'd out my fries for a side of mac and cheese. Time flew and we closed out happy hour and went home full, buzzed and delirious. We definitely agreed that we would make it a point to go back here to grab some food and chat it up with locals. 

Why don't we have one of these back home?!?!!??!"}
{"text":"Things did not go as well on my last visit here.  Potstickers were small and crisp, and the kitchen had to redo Potato Skins after dropping two of them on the way to our table.  MY BLTA contained a lot of bacon, but was lean on the avocado, and only one slice of bread was lightly smeared with Mayo--so I had to ask for more.  Then the sandwich, on lightly toasted sourdough, as requested--was good.  Skin-on French Fries were slightly crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside.   

Diane's French Dip looked pretty good after it was supplemented with melted Provolone and more au jus (which was very hot) to dress it up.  Service was good after a first Iced Tea refill was forgotten by our server sometime after she left our table to fetch it. 

XXX-1/2 stars overall this time around!"}
{"text":"St time here. Pretty empressed with the Happy Hour Breakfast. 
Awsome bloodymarys 
Our server is doing an amazing job. 
Thank you
Looking forward to coming back next weekend"}
{"text":"A fantastic happy hour! 50% off all drinks and pizzas! They have the best BBQ chicken pizza mmmmm yummy, the barbeque sauce and tender chicken exploded in my warm mouth causing a nice sensation with intense flavor! AWWWW mmmmm Ohhhhh yesssssss! The service is top notch. I had my birthday party here, for $20 bucks I reserved a private lounge with 42 inch plasma screen tvs and a fireplace and wine cellar chest with comfy sofas and chairs. Service was out of this world, the pizzas were fantastic! Our server treated us like royalty! I wish I knew her name :( Check out my pics!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is awesome the hot wings and onion ring are the best I've had in Henderson got to say better than California! On business and for a quick bite I highly recommend it !!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Drea the best waitress in town"}
{"text":"Great place but super Smokey. Could use a better ventilation system. Food is about a B but the service is excellent"}
{"text":"Popped in for a cocktail last night with a friend. Neither of us were sure what to expect from Sierra Gold especially since neither of us are super into hanging out at a *casino*. The gaming scene here is light and there is plenty of empty bar top if you don't want the distraction. The venue is pretty classy, no too smoky, and there are loads of tables. We opted for a small table to the side of the bar.

We were greeted pretty quickly and got drinks right away. Tried and true, I opted for a Tito's and soda while my friend enjoyed a brown ale of some sort. They offer two sizes of beer, large and Big Gulp size. Seriously, his beer was served in the biggest mug I have ever seen. I should also mention I don't get out much, so perhaps this is a normal size mug. 

The music was a lot of 90's and early 2000's hip hop, which I very much appreciate being in my mid 30's. Those were my jams. The drinks were dandy and reasonably priced and the food looks pretty legit. Pizzas, wings, as lot of staple bar food but a bit higher end. I haven't eaten yet, but if I make my way down to Sierra again, I'm totally getting a pizza."}
{"text":"Love coming here! My new favorite after work place!!!  Great happy hour specials. The bartenders and wait staff are super friendly!!! The food is really good especially when Roc is there! You can always tell when he is there because there's just a lil bit extra in taste and presentation. The garlic fries are better than most places in town.  Everyone I know brags about their breakfasts! Their desserts are DAMN DELISH!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not what I was expecting. I went for a birthday party in the private room in the back. This place was amazing. I went during game 7 of the NBA championship game. The room had 5 TVs and we enjoyed the environment. The food was good and the drinks were nice. My only issue with this place is the service. I will just chalk it off to the server we had. I think she really tried to do a good job, but it was poorly managed. Plus the way she handled the bills at the end was a total mess. They were all handed to one person and she walked away. Not good. I do plan on going back and I will update my review when I do that."}
{"text":"Service is sketchy. Happy Hour prices require their gaming club card which is bogus. The pizza used to be delicious and now its not so much. Since the quality of food has decreased, the prices should decrease accordingly. Happy Hour drink prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood bar. It's the perfect place to watch a Las Vegas Knights hockey game Or any other sporting event. When it is busy, it is sometimes difficult to get your waitresses attention, but it's all worth it because the food is absolutely outstanding. I think their nachos are some of the best in town. The bar is a little bit smoky so if you just want to enjoy a meal I suggest sitting up in the booths at the top of the restaurant. The staff is always very friendly and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Nicer than expected when I walked in but I've been to one of the other locations on the south side which was bigger and much busier. Not much at this location besides the normal bar with the video gaming, nothing special like pool tables or anything. Draft beer was pricey for a happy hour time frame, I was there between 4-6p and it was $6.50 for a pint. I don't know if I would go back again if it wasn't for meeting people who requested to meet at Sierra Gold but it was quiet enough to hold conversation."}
{"text":"I came in for a meal after work and I just wanted to eat and not gamble,  Whitney was my server.. What an amazing experience. Whitney was amazing and the food was on point.  Whitney is an asset to the PTs brand...."}
{"text":"Sierra Gold is pretty cool. I never knew it was here. I like the fact that it's really big and filled with more tables and high tops than a normal PTs would. The night we came in they had a DJ and it was pretty poppin. Service took a bit but that's normal for a PTs. They have happy hour! The only downside to my experience was that their computer system was down so I wasn't able to use my Gold Rewards Card. :( But overall, a nice bar."}
{"text":"As a fairly social person and someone who is not a stranger to bars, Sierra gold is a place that I have frequented quite a bit. 
The draw of Sierra gold is that it's a PTs, but just higher class, which I mostly agree with. You walk in and you see that the bar is quite spacious, there's the bar and the dining areas, so you can choose how you want your experience to be. I've had all types of nights here, from just a quick midday drink, to watching the game, to let's get chocolate wasted type of night. The bartenders are usually pretty knowledgable with their drinks and the service here, as with most places tends to vary on the staff. It sucks, but you just do what you can in that regards
Another amenity they have is a VIP room, so if you want a private place for to hang out with friends for like an event, that's totally doable but you do have to reserve it in advance. 
TL; DR I like this bar, it's not the greatest but it is good quality and I generally have a good experience while coming here and I'm rating it in the sense of its a locals bar"}
{"text":"I have never been to Sierra Gold or a PTs before. My husband and I were in the area and decided to stop by for dinner the other night. I did see their \"Coming Soon\" sign weeks ago, and noticed that they must have finally opened because the parking lot was full. 

One of the bartenders immediately greeted us when we walked in. You can choose to sit wherever you want. Our server was pretty friendly. She explained some of the menu items to us and convinced us to get a Beer & Bites Club card. Its free and you earn 1 point for every dollar spent. When you reach 100 points, you get $5 in comps. Not sure what other benefits it has, but I guess we'll find out some day. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers:

-Crisp Fried Mozzarella: warm and cheesy. Nothing too special, but it was good.
-BBQ Pork Stuffed Potato Skins: Very tasty and my favorite so far! The pork was juicy and they give you more bbq sauce on the side.
-Boneless Teriyaki Wings: not too bad, but the Teriyaki sauce was a bit on the salty side. 

Overall, a nice place to eat, drink, watch sports and relax. This location is a popular spot for the locals. It was really busy while we were there, which explains why our server took a while to check up on us and get our refills after we got our food. I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Sierra gold has been my new local bar as of recently. Located off of S. Jones and the 215, this is a HUGE establishment from the outside view. 

The interior is quite large and seats well up to 300 people or more. The bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, which can also seat about 50 patrons. There is 2 full sized pool tables, separate restaurant seating and an upstairs private event floor with a full bar. Sierra gold is a part of the gold group (pts pub, pts gold) so the food selections are very similar. In that regard, this is more of an upscale PT's, the food is a lot better. I haven't tried much of their food aside from happy hour offerings of pizzas and appetizers, but those are above average, good for the happy hour price. Draft selection of beer is big as well with about 25 different beers on draft, along with many more bottled. Cocktails are good, bartenders are knowledgeable and will gladly make any drink for you. 

Atmosphere is great, this place is often packed most nights and it's hard to grab a bar seat so arrive fairly early."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, fantastic service. Our server Alyssa made us feel like family: ). The food is top notch. Bar type atmosphere, but the food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. I met a friend for drinks. She was late. I had two drinks while waiting. I was consistently playing on a machine, stopping periodically when the Red Wings were going to score or did score. When my friend arrived, I played less. I had one drink and an appetizer after my friends arrived. I lost $22 of the $30 I put in over 1.5 hours. The food was mediocre. I waited too long for drinks. The bartenders were rude. I was charged for all drinks and told my gambling was \"inconsistent\". I will not return. It was clear why their happy hour crowd was limited to a few costumers. Hopefully, a different business takes over soon."}
{"text":"Went in for my first time tonight to get to go. Took awhile to get waited on at the bar. Dinner was over $20.00 for myself. Got home and the order was wrong. Tipped the bartender $3.00 on the order and it was wrong. Called and was told I could bring the food back. I am tired and ordering go food at 9:15 at night after a 12.5 hour shift. I do not want to go back!! Right the first time would have been nice. First impression mean a lot and this first impression sucked!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Been going there a few times a month since they opened. Great selection of draft brews served in iced 20 oz mugs. Food is great, especially the pizza called the Gilroy, a garlic ranch sauce with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. Wings are very good.  

I always hit Happy hour with friends from 5-7pm..half price pizzas and beer...wow! Best deal in Summerlin.

Wait staff is excellent! Always greet you at door and they are at your table when you sit down."}
{"text":"I have come to this location on 2 different occasions. The first time we had gone on a Friday night. Great service and food was good. Very nice place for drinks and socializing. However my recent experience was lousy. I recommended this bar to a close friend since I live down the street. We went in and the experience there was quite disappointing. We stopped in on a Wednesday night around 11p. It took about 5 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us due to the fact she was on her CELL PHONE. A server noticed us and got the bartenders attention so we could finally get some service. We ordered a round of drinks and the again were quickly forgotten. The place was practically empty at that time so there was no excuse. Finally another set of bartenders came in and got us another round. I asked for a menu so we could order some food but as soon as I ordered an appetizer the bartender quickly took the menu, guess we were not going to order entrees? The bar slowly started to fill up so we were really forgotten. We wanted to order another round and sat there for about 10 minutes with empty drinks and no attention so I had to wave down the bartender and pay my tab. We went to another bar. I will say maybe this time was a downer but hopefully next time we stop in wont we as disappointing. All in all drinks and food is good but this place is really lacking in the hospitality and service."}
{"text":"I have had to downgrade this to a 3 star review because of the terrible service at this location. 

The service is always SLOW, yet I always seem to come back for more, lol. I just can't resist the bar food and cheap drinks."}
{"text":"I've been in twice after CrossFit workouts with my CrossFit family and I must say that the service has been excellent both times. It took them a little longer than expected to get my quesadilla ready last night but Gabi and Makenzie were great servers. My only complaint and it really isn't a complaint was the $7 I paid for the tall Shock Top. Both of my experiences there have been superb so far and I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Not a good value for cost...ordered French dip and steak fajitas ..

French dip very small for 13.00 and fajitas rice looked really bad like reheated and steak was poor quality steak skirt.

Not good for high price paid.. 35.00 total with 2 ice teas."}
