{"text":"I would usually not have anything to do with a Mall Food Court, but I decided to give this one a whirl since I have not eaten any Middle Eastern Food since moving to The Valley over a year ago! I have been eating Middle Eastern and Greek food for decades, and I have to say, they did a very good job here! 
I went with their Chicken Shawarma combo meal which came with some great yellow rice, a nice serving of chicken(fresh grilled to order) solid salad with a great dressing, a very good pita, and a side of garlic yogurt! It's a place I'd definitely go back to, they have a very large menu with just about any Middle Eastern dish you'd expect! Very friendly service! I have to say, probably one of the best Mall Food Court meals I have ever had and for under $9 with a large drink! 
Great job folks at Royal Pita! Looking forward to trying your Falafel and Hummus, as well as other dishes!
I could see this easily being a 5 STAR Spot once I try some of the other dishes they offer!"}

{"text":"I'm so excited that this place is back open in the mall. I found out it's under new ownership and after trying it again, the food is even better than before. Trust me, skip the rest and try the best."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in at the Royal Pita after a movie. I am a big fan of Greek/Mediterranean food. My husband not so much yet he enjoyed the food here. 

I would recommend anyone whom is in the Metro Mall at the food court to check them out! 
The food is fresh and has a great traditional taste."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed until I was walking past it. 

The falafel plate was fantastic! It made me so happy. 

Very delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Love it. Authentic Arabian dishes and reasonably priced. Loved the chicken Shawarma plate and sandwiches. Kids meals are beautiful too."}
{"text":"It's all good.  My kids take music lessons at PCM so we are at metro center every Friday night and this is the  place  we always eat.  Have tried everything and not had one thing that I  wouldn't recommend.  Especially like the steak pita and chicken scwarma."}
{"text":"I only get this place through uber eats but it's been my go to for this type of food. 

Saffron rice is fantastic. Chicken is great. Can't believe this is mall food!"}
{"text":"Dry like some easy bake shit, also poor customer service. Wouldn't recommend anyone who likes flavorful Greek food."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to eat. All the food there is delicious. I love it so much. All the workers there are friendly. The good is definitely better than the other food in the food court. I recommend this place to everyone! They have a really big menu and everything is amazing. Everything is also fresh and I love it so much. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was pretty good.  I've had better around the valley.  I'd come back if I get an irresistible craving again."}
{"text":"This place is really great. The gyro plate is delicious. The cut of lamb tastes so good and is so thin sliced. We stayed in this part of Phoenix for a week and four of us thought this was the best place we ate. The salad is a real Greek salad with cucumbers and a great sauce and the guy who runs it was way friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good place to eat close to work.. The place is inside the metro mall in the food court.. Very nice guys quick and reasonable price place to eat"}
