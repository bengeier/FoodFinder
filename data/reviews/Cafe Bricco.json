{"text":"I love Bricco downtown and i was excited when i say there was one in fairlawn and the price are supposed to be lower. I first went for lunch the food and the cost was good, the service on the other had needed major improvement. I saw they had breakfast, so i decided to stop one morning, the food was average nothing out of this world. The Service at breakfast was HORRIBLE, the server offered more coffee to those who had it, but had to ask for more water a few times before i got it.  told the manager and he did not seem to care. I have not been back for a while so maybe the service has improved, i sure hope it has"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here with the great over the top service. I loved the coffee served to me here it was nice and calm very elegant scene"}
{"text":"Was here with a large party. Normally a pretty quiet atmosphere with a relatively intimate feel to it. Service was decent, we actually got our food pretty quickly considering how many people we had in our party.  Appetizers: had the pita with marinara/goatcheese and calamari. Both were pretty good.  Entrees: Crab cake was acceptable- the 2 cakes were large in size, but there didn't seem to be much in terms of crab meat, it was mainly just bread or whatever other type of filling they use to stuff the cake with. It did come with a nice arugula salad and lots of haricot/green beans to balance the meal with.  Fettuccine with grilled shrimp didn't fare as well. The shrimp themselves grilled nicely with a kick of pepper. By itself, the shrimp would have been excellent. However, the fettuccine and the sauce it was in was pretty bland, as in it looked and tasted like sauteed onions in half-and-half with corn starch or the like to thicken it up.  Overall, would probably look else where before returning. Not a bad choice if you don't wish to venture out and are looking for a good drink and decent meal if you are staying at the adjoining DoubleTree."}
{"text":"Bad news. Our party of 7 was largely ignored during the 90 minutes we were there. My sisters order arrived after everyone else's was done so she took it to go.  My food and my mom's food were cold; but since our waitress never came to check in on us, we had no way of informing her. My husband rated his hamburger a 6 out of 10. The manager needs to be retrained as he split his staff between inside and outside on the patio. Bypass this place."}
{"text":"Never again.  Not only will I not set foot back in Bricco, but I'll never stay at the Doubletree because of the rude manager at Bricco.  I tried to complain to the desk at the hotel and was told that the individual that had spoke to us the way he did was the Manager so not to put in a complaint until the next morning.  We were locked on the Patio and knocked to be let back in...no one came...shook the door and the Manager came and opened the door.  I assumed he was letting us back in.  Instead he told us the door was locked (as he's standing in it) and that me and my fiancee can jump the fence to get back in....Seriously?!  He then shut the door and walked back in.  Yes, we're still standing on the patio locked out.  This was at about 11:30.  I jumped the fence, went the entire way around the building, back into Bricco and to the door that he just shut to let her in.  Very rude and cost them my repeat business.  This man does not need to be in a business that deals with the public...get him in an office behind a wall where he doesn't have to be bothered by paying customers."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden in plain sight at the Double Tree in Fairlawn.  I don't often think of a hotel restaurant. Wanted to go to Bricco downtown, but the Italian Festival was going on, so we headed to Fairlawn for lunch. We were greeted by the affable manager and headed to the patio. The patio umbrellas are more like tents without sides. No hot sunny spots. Our server was pleasant and efficient.  We shared the bean dip..yummy. My DC had a half wedge and said it was good. I had a really good Cobb salad. Give it a try. Another hit by Dave Glenny."}
{"text":"Ok... this place was terrible today! Food was less than mediocre at best and the server (at least the one we had) was totally incompetent.  I never write negative reviews (my first one actually), but Bricco needed/deserved it!  First, I mentioned that I am gluten free and asked what options were safe to order and her response was \" I have no idea what gluten-free is\".  And then came back and said we can't do anything gluten free.  When I said I can just order eggs... she said \"no\".  How can you not be able to make eggs gluten free?!?!? Then, she said again... I have no idea what gluten free is.  So I just moved on and decided I would order what I thought would likely be gluten free (eggs and bacon).  Then my mom and aunt ordered the classic breakfast with eggs VERY well done (they asked for the eggs to be browned) and rye toast.  They were very clear when the ordered.  She brought out their eggs runny.  We are not confrontational people and in fact... Try to avoid it at all costs.  So, my aunt just ate hers but when my mom politely asked if they could be browned a little more, the server said the chef told her this was the best he could do WITHOUT even going back to ask the chef or offering to take it back to have them cooked a little more well done.  What?!? There was not an ounce of brown to show they were well done.  And she brought out one English muffin and one order of rye toast with their classic breakfasts. When my aunt had ordered she said to please duplicate my moms order- which was rye toast. When we politely mentioned that we accidentally got an English muffin and only one order of rye toast, she said this is what you ordered... \"Honey, I wrote it down\".  She said don't blame me.  She would not exchange the English muffin for rye toast. It was unbelievable! She continued to argue with us so again we just dropped it.  Also... I should mention that I believe they forgot to plug in the toaster because the English muffin and the Rye-bread we're not even warmed or toasted. Also, my mom ordered decaf coffee and she brought out a pot that was also ice cold. Something has gone wrong in their kitchen and with the server and at this restaurant.  Maybe the server needed to be better trained.  Hopefully not all servers are as bad as she was though!   My parents have been going here for many years and today was a disaster.  Save your money or find another breakfast place to eat and ENJOY! This place is definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast.  I'm local so was not staying in the hotel.  My husband & I just wanted to try something different for breakfast than our usual Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel.  Well, after experiencing breakfast here, I'm back to Bob Evans! I ordered eggs Benedict.  The eggs were fried, not poached, which to be fair was stated on the menu that way.  But, it being eggs Benedict, I expected the yolks to be runny.  Instead, the fried eggs were over cooked with hard yolks.  The so-called Hollandaise sauce was thin and completely tasteless.  I had coffee and they brought a pot to keep at the table.  Good idea, except that even though it was a thermal pot, the coffee was tepid at best.  My husband ordered the vegetable frittata, and that was also over cooked.  It's not like it was so busy that the chef lost track while cooking these egg dishes.  It was a Monday morning at 10:15 and there were only 3 other diners in the place besides my husband and I.  I gave it one star because the waitress was nice.  Don't ever bother with breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Ok what happened here!  Went to one in valley and it is and always amazing.  This one is a total miss.  I ordered salmon Caesar salad medium and it came out a mini piece of burnt fish with mayo type based dressing.  Literally like they opened a jar of mayo and added it to salad.   We order pasta dish also total flavorless MISS.  Guess we are one and done."}
{"text":"Good for a quiet lunch. The wedge is decent. The patio is nice and prices are reasonable.   For dinner, the downtown location has better food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We found a new (for our family) place to go for breakfast on Sunday mornings!    We've  tried many of the local  spots in Fairlawn and our experience at Bricco was wonderful!  No waiting, good food, clean, inviting and the wait staff was on their 'A\" game!   We will definitely be back!  Goodbye, First Watch.  Goodbye Sweet Pea Cafe,  See ya later Bob Evans!  HELLO CAFE BRICCO!!!  P. S.  Our son and daughter-in-law love this place for lunch and dinner.   We can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Another great birthday lunch on a cold, gray Akron day. We enjoyed our blackened chicken salad and artichoke/chicken pizza on a quiet Wednesday. Great menu choices and wait staff."}
{"text":"My second or third time at Cafe Bricco and first for breakfast was disappointing due to poor service and food quality. I've enjoyed my experiences at other Bricco restaurants, appreciating their innovative menus but service has never been anything above adequate. The service for breakfast at cafe Bricco was at an even lower level full of splashed coffee on the table, inattentive and messy serving staff. Our breakfast food would have felt right at home at a chain restaurant not what I envisioned for Cafe Bricco. I hope that this was an isolated incident though the service seems an ongoing concern."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fantastic lunch here today! Between my husband and myself,we enjoyed 2 beers (Short's Soft Parade), 2 glasses of wine (Coastal Cab), a bowl of tomato artichoke soup, and their turkey croissant sandwich (turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce) with cole slaw...all for $28! The sandwich was huge and we even took home some of it."}
{"text":"A very nice cosy and a classy place with a very nice atomosphere. Wine and food selections were great. Enjoyed spending time at the place. A special thanks to Mandy for making it very nice for us. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"been to dinner here a couple of times.  very must like the regular bricco downtown (not just sandwiches and burgers like bricco pub).  I love their food and they have good drinks as well.  Restaurant is a little small but I have been seated pretty quickly without reservations."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my girlfriend. We recently moved into the area and have been looking for good options for brunch and breakfast on the weekends. I was severely disappointed in the food and atmosphere.  I guess we made the mistake of ordering the same thing but we both had the Mexican omelette and it was the blandest thing I had ever eaten. No spice, no flavor, nothing. The service was fine but the atmosphere was also lacking. I guess we should have expected as much since it's located in a hotel. We just expected a little more ambiance and we were the only people eating there other than what seemed like two regulars who our waiter continued to go over and talk to.  We won't be coming back here but I'm sure it's fine it you are staying in the hotel and don't want to go out. Just don't get the Mexican omelette"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today, and was very pleased! I ordered a pizza, which was delicious and definitely enough for two meals! My friend got the cheese tortellini, which was just about a perfect portion for one sitting. The service was ok, not superb, though. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Good wine!    Get the peppers stuffed with Italian sausage, chorizo, and cheese."}
{"text":"I had blueberry pancakes, they were frozen blueberries,  the top pancake was very dry on top from being under the warmer. Service was slow, it's nice to be out on the patio.   This place is ok for the price, but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Excellent martini selection, size and quality.  Food is high quality, wonderful and tasty."}
{"text":"Recently dined at Cafe Bricco is a decent lunch and dinner spot.  It was tasty, well seasoned and fulfilling.  Bartender friendly and is an overall good spot for young travelers."}
{"text":"Decided to treat my bestie to lunch here for her birthday after our spa appointment...our musts were - patio, wine and decent food sans kids (we were without ours so we didn't want to ruin our \"spa\" day).  Since we were down the street we thought we'd finally give Cafe Bricco a whirl and we were quite happy we did.  We arrived just after 11am and the entire patio was open for our choosing.  Grabbed a table in the sun, relaxed and ordered a bottle of wine (which they have a pretty decent selection - again my reviews will also tell you to just order the bottle).    For lunch I couldn't decide between two sandwiches on the menu so I did a custom order - no problem and it was delicious.  Definitely want to go back and try additional menu items as it was hard to choose.  Service was great, but again we weren't in a hurry and took our time."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to this place again - even if I were staying in the hotel that it's attached to.   The bartender Shannon was wandering around the restaurant when I say down at the bar so the host had to get me a drink after he noticed me waiting. The whole time I was there she was to busy telling trashy jokes with the locals to notice my empty glass. The other bartender (Wayne or dwanye) was the only one on the ball at all and it was his first day - I guess he hadn't had a chance to pick up her bad habits. In the time I was there two separate parties that walked in had to look around the restaurant for help because the host had wandered off.   The pasta I had was decent but they brought me cold bread which was a put-off.   It's worth it to go next door to beaux's. Easy choice."}
{"text":"On the fence with 3 or 4, so here's how the two compare. Given the area, it's attached to a hotel, well priced, and brekky was better than I would've guessed ... kinda brings up the stars to a 4. But if rating strictly for food, atmosphere and overall experience then barely a 3, but maybe had an off day?   Hubby is a Diamond Doubletree member so brekky is comp, and I wasn't expecting much. We came down around 930 and every seat was taken including a group of 40 in the back. They were not staffed for the breakfast rush. In fact, we waited 20-25 mins before anyone acknowledged us or that we (and a few other groups) were even waiting. Seated after 35 mins, a table near us waited 20 mins to get coffee/water and the lady leaving when we were seated told us worst breakfast ever, ice cold when delivered then never saw anyone again.   Now our experience wasn't as bad. Once seated and the large groups left, service was better. A bit slow but the food was ok. Although not so tasty that I'd repeat the wait again and would've been happier with a Starbucks brekky sandwich. But we're here for 5 days so I'm going to stick with oatmeal other visits :)"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for something great but this was nothing more than you would get at a breakfast buffet.  I was so disappointed when I ordered the classic that comes with eggs, meat, \"hashbrowns\", and a muffin or bagel.  i was really excited to order hashbrowns then they came out.  i was so disappointed to see frozen cubed potatoes.  i mean i would have been super excited with shredded hashbrowns  thats what i think of when i say hashbrowns, or even fresh cut/cubed  and fried potatoes.  nope from a bag frozen put in the oven cubes.  In their defense they did have some kind of seasoning on them.  that was pretty good.  Then then only had tabasco sauce.  LMAO  why do resturantes call this hot sauce?!  on the bright side the bacon was perfectly crisp.  i should have ordered an extra side of bacon to go.  the disappointing part is i could have made a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Good drink selection and great food options. Always a nice seafood entree and good appetizers. Food is consistent and quality is high. We love this place!  Not too loud and servers are very attentive. We love the Shrimp and. Scallop entree and crab cakes. You can always remove sauces or butter if you prefer."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several tomes as a guest of the hotel. Every time I ask myself why I did it! This place is horrible! The most recent visit included waiting 10 minutes just to get a seat for breakfast and there were only 3 other tables occupied at the time! After being seated it took another 5 minutes to get someone to greet us. Once we got the waitresses attention, I told my colleagues after ordering coffee, not to let the waitress leave without ordering our food! I along with one of my colleagues ordered the breakfast burrito, another ordered the spinach omelet and the other ordered the breakfast croissant. The burritos were burned on the bottom and the filling was tasteless. The spinach omelet was way over cooked and the croissant was terribly bland. My home fries were 1 inch cubes of frozen potatoes deep fried with no seasoning at all. Do yourself a favor and skip this place!"}
{"text":"We sat out on the deck and the weather was beautiful. The atmosphere there is wonderful. The food is just regular food. Nothing special. Therefore I give it a three."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The Parmesan Rosemary fries - big FAIL! The description is misleading.  Should be fresh rosemary, not dried and the sauce tasted like mayonnaise w/a hint of Parmesan cheese. Don't waste money on this!!!"}
{"text":"Good heavens is this little sweet treat of a cafe hidden, but well worth the venture into the hotel, for its delicacies proved worthy of any possible confusion.  We did not come for dinner this evening, but instead, a rare occasion, simply dessert.  Sometimes that's the best way to do it though.  Generally you won't get dessert at places because you're too stuffed from dinner, so coming for dessert was a nice change of pace and BOY oh BOY did Cafe Bricco DELIVER!  Our waiter was friendly, fun, not annoyed by the fact that we weren't ordering meals too, and just an all around pleasure.  He kept our water glasses full, which was key actually, because these desserts could certainly be rich.  We ordered tiramisu, pistachio gelato, I had an Espresso Martini with chocolate drizzle, and the boys had caramel apple cheesecake.  Is your mouth salivating yet?  Because I'm about to pass out over here just reminiscing with my taste buds - overwhelming nostalgia.  The cheesecake was rich and creamy, yet not overkill with the topping, syrup not too thick, and a nice hint of apple.  My Espresso Martini was strong *good on ya, bartender* but not overpowering, and the perfect crisp cold temperature I need in a sweet alcoholic drink.  The chocolate drizzle swirled into the cocktail making it that much more enticing.  The pistachio gelato was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious.  We almost didn't order it because I felt like we had enough, but the waiter recommended it and I am SO happy he did.  The tiramisu was UN-REAL.  Seriously.  I was in absolute love with every bite I took, but also had to limit myself from becoming so stuffed that my pants burst.  Okay okay, I was wearing leggings.  But you get the point.  Made fresh and you could tell!  Rich sweet mascarpone cheese hitting your lips with the exterior of nicely dipped espresso ladyfingers.  Unbelievably perfect.  The night was a huge hit all around and these desserts were, quite literally, the cherry on the cake.  No that's not true.  We didn't get any cherries!  How about chocolate drizzle on the latte, or the caramel on the cheesecake, instead.  You get the point  ;)"}
{"text":"Cafe Bricco has good food just like the location near Playhouse Square. It isn't exactly the same but if you like one, you'll like the other. Order a stiff drink or maybe a shot of liquor. You'll need it. Let me explain.  I don't know you and you may or may not accept what I write as accurate or meaningful. Let's face it, you're on Yelp reading a review for a restaurant in Akron when you could be making the world a better place. I'm not judging you. You matter in some way to someone and that is why I am concerned for you.  Getting into this restaurant involves you almost (or in fact) being involved in an automobile accident. You could very easily be injured in your quest to get a pizza with something on it other than pepperoni.   If you try to get here from the highway, God help you. If you are coming in from Akron, it's russian roulette to cross the two lanes of route 18 with all the junker drunkards plowing into each other and cussing like they're from Columbus. If you are trying to get there from the road next to the mall directly across the street, you aren't going to make it. You are going to try, fail, and die unless you bulldog hard right and turn around way the hell out there by the Max and Erma's. \"..but wait, Slick, that's three miles up the street...I'll just shoot across 18 and be there in a flash.\" No, friend. You won't.  I have seen people dipped in plastic, skinned like a trout and posed in a museum with a basketball. I have tasted sausage. When I tell you that Bricco food is good, it may be right but by God when I tell you to be careful getting to this place, please accept my words like they are the most important you'll ever read.  Please. Do it for the people that want a gift from you at Christmastime. I love you."}
