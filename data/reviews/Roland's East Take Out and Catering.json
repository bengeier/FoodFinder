{"text":"One of the best Roti's here by far! It has great flavour and spices and I also recommend trying their special Carribean fried rice!!! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food, been in business for over 30 years. The owner that is always there is very pleasant and nice. Come here from Scarborough for the food, worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Food is below average,often seems cooked and reheated over a span of days so not everything tastes fresh.The prices are not justifiable for the food.Its often oily as well.I recommend eating here if you are starving."}
