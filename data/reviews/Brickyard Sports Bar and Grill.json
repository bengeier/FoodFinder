{"text":"Well, my prediction was right. I drove by over the weekend and the place is now out of business. Good riddance!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I woul give this place another try after visiting it as The Native New Yorker & being disappointed.  Was excited that a new place was opening.  A great lace to watch a game... Lots of TVs...if that's all you want to do.  There were plenty of open seats when I arrived, & the waitress sat me in a booth that had the seat all ripped up & taped in duct tape that was peeling off.  I ordered a BLT & specifically asked her if the bread was \"good\" bread, or the cheap \"wonder\" type. I ordered it lightly toasted.  It was served to me OVERTOASTED & on cheap nasty toast.  Really??  It had about three drops of mayo on it & I had to request a side of mayo.  I would have been embarrased to serve it to someone. Charge an extra dollar & serve your food on decent bread.  Signs are posted all over inside that the same owners are still there. Disappointing.  They had a chance with changing the name to really make something of  the place.  I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I miss this place.  I missed it more when it was a Native New Yorker but they pretty much had the same menu as the Brickyard.  I do like the layout better as the Upper Crust Pizza place, but the prices suck now."}
