{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Great food, great service and a lot more to come from this new pub. Had the corned beef rolls and they knocked my socks off! I love Reuben's and that's exactly what these are but wrapped in phyllo dough and served with 1000 to dip. What a great idea. Looking at the menu I think  going to venture to a burger next time. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. They had some solid wings. Milo made a mean skittles shot for my group. The atmosphere was great with a cool look inside. A hidden gym off the normal scottsdale path. 2 thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Super knowledgeable and friendly staff. Milo is fantastic. Good food, good beer, and their sound system is bumpin'. I'll be back next time I'm in Scottsdale for sure."}
{"text":"You Will Love this place. A great place to watch every NFL game. Friendly, unpretentious, reasonable. Try the sliders!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Fresh and hot!  The burger was melt in your mouth amAzing and the bacon was thick and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Service  was super friendly and the place was super clean!  Highly recommend if you are looking for an amazing meal you don't have to get all dolled to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best part of our long weekend. Mylo the bartender was the hardest working person my friends and I have ever seen. Come hang and play some shuffleboard you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a great show at Stand up Scottsdale for some drinks..food was deeeelish! And the drinks were even better! Great prices, and friendly staff! Jeff and Mary truly take care of ya :)"}
{"text":"Jacks place is great! Just grabbed a beer and watched some Sunday football. The service is fantastic, and our bartneder Milo was extremely friendly! Reuben Rolls are delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Jack's with my son to watch the game and grab a bite to eat. They have a great craft beer selection on tap. The happy hour and daily specials are perfect and well priced. We ordered the cheese curds since, I'm originally from Wisconsin. Turns out the owner gets them from Wisconsin, these are the real deal, not some crap imitation. Try them!
 I highly recommend the Mac-n-cheese and the Philly cheese steak sliders. All around friendly staff and great atmosphere. Lots of flat screens (even in the men's bathroom) so you don't miss a thing. Great football spot! It's off the beaten spot but,worth the trip."}
{"text":"Do I have to rate them? I really wanted to like them. Second time here. Still here now actually. The servers are super nice. The kitchen however clearly doesn't care... Nor does the owner. The owner was identified and this person did nothing but maybe clear two glasses from the bar...that belonged to a friend. I ordered a taco salad. What salad, I asked? Barely two leaves of lettuce and literally a quarter of a hamburger patty topped the \"salad\". The SALAD! Sent it back. Ordered pretzels cause who can screw that up? The cheese sauce was half goo and 1/2 something else. I just don't get it. If you can't expedite decent looking grub then don't serve it. And give a shit...just a little...about what the end game is. The beers on draft are decent. The servers are friendly but aside from that don't come hungry. It's not worth your disgust or gut ache."}
{"text":"Milo was taking care of us while we watched the Cardinals game and was amazing! Food was great."}
{"text":"They had great food and ice cold beer!.. Definitely a spot to come eat and drink.. The service was great.. No complaints"}
{"text":"Came in for a few beers with some friends. Ended up getting fish-n-chips and they were incredible! Milo was our bartender and he was great! He had a great sense of humor and made us feel very welcome. 

I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went during happy hour. Bartender served us at our table. He was great and made good margaritas. Great happy hour deals. Ordered edamame. A bit too much salt.  For entree ordered blackened salmon. Didn't look Iike the picture on the Yelp page at all. Very small portion. Served with garlic, red mashed potatoes witch I was really looking forward to. They were very lumpy which I don't mind but I don't believe they had any milk in them at all. Definitely could've been a little creamy.  Huge side of broccoli.  Too much actually.  More like an entree of broccoli with a side of salmon. Would go back and give it another try. Probably go back on a Tues. for 4.95 burger and fries. Hubby did enjoy his burger."}
{"text":"This bar is great.  The beer selection is great and lots of great food options on the menu.  Best of all, the service is amazing!  Everyone is super friendly!  I can't wait to spend football Sundays here!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! An absolute hidden gem. Do not confuse this place with a dive bar, it's just off the path a little bit. The bar and restaurant is welcoming and set up quite well. Great place to watch a game. I love the beer selection (finally a bar that doesn't have the same beer as everyone else) and am thoroughly impressed with the food quality (I highly recommend the cheese curds and the chicken wings - dry rub is so unique and tasty). I see myself going here at least once or twice a week due to the great atmosphere, them having my favorite brewery on tap (Lost Coast), and phenomenal food (it's rare that a bar has high quality food). And I also love that they play the music videos on the tvs of all the music that is playing...and the men's bathroom has flat screen tvs so you don't miss any of your game"}
{"text":"What an awesome bar! Milo and Pat are awesome, very talkative bartenders. The nachos are phenom, actually all of the food was really good. Quite possibly our new Sunday hangout. Awesome place guys!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered food from here tonight through Grub Hub. We placed our order at 4:56 PM with an estimated arrival time of 6:01 PM. Waited till 6:30 PM to call Jacks Place.  They said they never received the order. They immediately began working on our order and called Grub Hub to ask them what was going on. An hour later we get our food but no drinks.  Grub Hub chalked it up as a technical issue and said they did not receive the drinks from Jacks Place.  After all of this we began to eat our food and it was glorious magic to our taste buds.  Jacks Place also tossed is a free scoop of their whiskey walnut ice cream, which was amazing as well. Jacks Place is delicious! Terrible service from Grub Hub.  Highly recommend their Reuben eggrolls!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!  A group of friends and I wanted to go out to Old Town but we didn't want to get dressed up for the night clubs and wanted a more social atmosphere (not so cramped and loud) to be able to eat and drink at.  One of my friends suggested we go to the King Bar and found that the bar had changed names and in fact everything else!  They kept the leather bar top which is a unique feature, got rid of all the annoying chalk walls with brighter paint, added a ton of high definition tvs throughout, freezing cold beer, and most importantly fantastic food made to order.  After playing shuffleboard and a few pints of magic hat we finished off our time at Jack's Place with a round of pecan whisky on the rocks and the poke with ahi sliders.  The chef even came out of the kitchen to see how the food was and get our reviews on his cooking!  Great place to go and will definitely be one of our regular stops."}
{"text":"Wing Wednesday is how we happened upon this place. Very good food and great service. We will definitely be back. If you are a brew person they have a great draft selection all the time. They also have a really cool, leather wrapped bar."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but a bit disorganized.  The server/bartender was nice and once we got the food it was above average."}
{"text":"What a great find. The food was served by a wonderful staff and we even had a great conversation with the owners. Their passion for great food, awesome beer and a fun time shows in their overall quality and superior hospitality. Let's talk first about the food. My friend and I both got the chefs special - a 6oz sirloin with veggies and a twice baked potato. I hope they make this a regular item on the menu because holy COW...this dish was amazing. All seasonings were on point and entire meal was cooked to perfection. We had a couple fellows at our table order Jacks sliders which were gone in minutes, no complaints there at all! One ballsy gent ordered a pastrami burger and said it was incredible. He was so happy! Next lets talk about the drink selection. Wow - so many beers! So many cold and frothy options! And happy hour looks incredible (note to self) :)  the service: everyone was attentive, accurate and kind. Can't get better than that! Our water glasses were always full and we had plenty of options to order more beer. Excellent service! As far as the atmosphere: games! Awesome music and tv's everywhere. It's a perfect place for all your senses. I would say, this bar sets the bar high. Definitely going back and bringing more friends...you can camp out here for day drinking on football Sunday or a little happy hour wats after work. Love this place! Jacks Place!"}
{"text":"Went to Jack's Place last night for a quick bite to eat with my mother. The bartender explained to us that they had a new and improved menu that just began that day. (7/21/15) I was really impressed with the simple, but yet great options the menu had to offer. I had the Prosciutto Spinach Flat bread which was excellent. My mom had the Caesar Salad which had a really neat presentation. Grilled romaine lettuce, with amazing tomatoes, shaved cheese, and an amazing dressing! Defiantly something all should try! Chef Sami made sure to ask us a few questions on the meal to make sure it was satisfactory, he also let us try the Mac and Cheese that was added to the menu.  I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan, but wow did it have great flavor! We thought it was really cool for the Chef to make an appearance and ask a customers thoughts. While talking with the chef he was really excited to tell us about the Arizona grown beef and also the vegan and gluten free options he has available. It was a very fun and comfortable atmosphere for a bar setting. This place would be a great place to watch football with a few friends or a lot of friends as they have many great TV's and an awesome sound throughout the whole bar. They have many large tables set up for groups, and even a few fun arcade games. I can't wait to come back with a group of friends to watch Sunday football, drink a few beers (16 on tap) and enjoy great food."}
{"text":"Love this Scottsdale spot! Great food & service always + music & games. Perfect for parties"}
{"text":"The prices and the menu have already changed since they opened, but the bar looks exactly the same as the other two failed bars in this location. It is only 2 bucks off appetizers, not 1/2 off as shown in all the photos. They had a new menu which I glanced at includes Kale Salad, always a big hit at bars. I only had short stay as after I ordered a beer, the bartendress disappeared. Perhaps the tap was dry, but the place was too dark and dingy anyway. Nobody can seem to make any changes to this bar that make it worth visiting."}
{"text":"Great place! We went based on Yelp recommendations and what a gem! We were looking for a sports oriented place so we could watch the Saturday night NASCAR race (yes, in Scottsdale) and enjoy good beer and food. We live in the East Valley but hung out in Scottsdale while our kids participated in a function - and we found what we were looking for and then some! The food was delicious, beer was ice cold, we watched the race and the bartenders were terrific. I highly recommend this off the beaten path place - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I thought the burger was good.  I did enjoy the games they had and the waiter was so awesome!!!  Was not perfect but I would go back."}
{"text":"I shouldn't be giving this a five star because it's not an Irish bar, but Milo and Patrick make it a five star.  The food is on point and love the  pretzels. Free shuffle board for those senior citizens too broke to go on a cruise.  The bar top is nice and soft for when you pass out.  The urinals have tvs, which is good for when you drink the king Kong sized beers.

Great place"}
{"text":"In town to party with some friends last Thursday and went to Jack's Place for a few drinks and appetizers before heading to OHSO. Great atmosphere and had the coldest beer I have ever had! There was a thin layer of ice floating in my pint glass which made it the best tasting orange blossom I'll ever have. 

I had a few beers at OHSO and my friends got a pitcher of their house brewed whatever and all the beer was warm. They brought us a cup filled with ice to put in the pitcher to cool the beer down. We couldn't handle the warm beer any longer and went right back to Jack's Place to finish the night off with ice cold beers. If you love ice cold beer go to Jack's Place!!!!"}
{"text":"The bar theme was decent. I guess you can call it a watering hole. The burgers on the other hand are terrible. My wife actually said Burger King was better and she hates Burger King.  I did like the bathroom it has tvs so you don't miss a thing and a place to put your beer."}
{"text":"So first we saw all the reviews and thought it was going to be a great experience.... We were wrong.

First we had to wait an hour for our salads. Another 20 minutes go by and we get our appetizers, one set of wings...

Another 30 minutes go by and my other two guest received their dinner, I had continue to wait another 15 minutes because the potatoes weren't \"working with them\" so I had to substitute for fries instead..

Looked like the waitress was too busy with the guys at the bar.. It becomes a problem when we can see our food at the window but she continues to serve the men at the bar. She was not apologetic at all about the whole situation.

Food was decent but definitely not worth the wait at all. Disappointment.

Never written a review before but because of this experience I definitely am going to start.

Never returning."}
{"text":"Jacks Place is a very clean, beautiful decorated bar. The food is not your typical bar food. It's BETTER! The guacamole is unlike any other you'll ever have!! And the fusion of foods will blow your mind!! And not to mention the master chef makes everything from scratch everyday! Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Nicely remodeled from the prior establishment, flat screens if you want to watch a game or shuffleboard if you want to play your own game. We had several apps which were either made in-house or locally sourced which were all good.  I'll be exploring more of the menu for future happy hours."}
{"text":"It's hard to review a business that can't open the doors on time. Left at 11:45 this morning, doors still locked. 30 years as a restaurant operator... Can't accept this."}
{"text":"Great food and always great beer on tap. Staff is friendly and their Wednesday wing special can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Neat little place.  The asian style wings were pretty decent.  Sticky, but nice size.  I think with specials the place is more worthwhile but it seems like they changed the specials since they sent the mailings out.  Seems like they're trying to just get loyal locals that know the specials because they're there all the time?"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times since it opened. My friend mentioned wanting to go to a \"pub\" for dinner, so we decided to try Jack's Place out. Hot mess. 

Walked in the door and stood looking helpless for a few minutes before someone finally told us we could seat ourselves. A good ten minutes went by before our server gave us menus. She explained they were \"slammed\" and aren't usually this crowded...and she'd return to get our drink orders. I looked around and saw maybe seven tables and a smattering of people at the bar...not what I'd consider to be slammed at 7pm on a Friday in Old Town, but whatever. 10 or 15 minutes went by again, and the waitress returned, and apologetically took our drink order. More time elapsed and a man brought out my IPA and a half-full pint of beer for my friend. The keg popped, he said, and they'd bring out another beer for him. But not for another 20 mins. We both ordered steak sandwiches, which took over an hour to come out. I will say the sandwiches were very good. But the place is terribly mismanaged, I can't imagine how it will last. When we finally left, we had been there for two hours. The server was apologetic but nothing was comped on the bill, except they didn't charge my friend for his half-full pint (I should hope not!). Over $40 for our meal. This place will be gone by summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a drink last night- nice clean place, friendly staff & they let us sample their wings- they rocked! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in for a few drinks before going to the comedy club next door.  The bartender made something up for me based on what i wanted.  Very cool.  The place is huge and looks like there is a big food menu as well."}
{"text":"Very clean sports bar. Milo the bartender is a dancing bear. Obviously loves his job.  Food is great. Absolutely a diamond in the rough!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful bartender and wait staff. We are on a stay cation in old town Scottsdale.. what a nice way to spend the 4th of July. You need to try the loaded tater tots and Lumpia rolls. Happy hour all day on Sunday. Try a bloody mary with bacon salt on the rim.  4 bucks and it's a deal. Alex will take care if you. Enjoy my friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Coldest beer anywhere, using the Glyco system.  Awesome mixed drinks and specials. 25 cent wings on wednesday!!  The food is great, definitely a break from other places in the area."}
{"text":"the bartender is amazingly friendly. the place has a great vibe. truly the coolest bar ive ever seen!!! it is all leather!!! they serve cucumber water that is on point!!!! and the presentation of the jack specialty sliders is only as amazing as the taste of them! best bacon ive ever had! visiting arizona and so impressed. definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good food and a good drink!"}
{"text":"Milo was a great server and made our experience very personal. Food was good but nothing out of this world. Fun for groups to play shuffle board and darts."}
{"text":"Fun bar and a great bartender!  Milo was super knowledgable about the beers on tap and had the best moves this side of the Mississippi. He also gave us free candy canes"}
{"text":"I was really underwhelmed by this place.  It's located in the same space as a few other failed bars and has had a light refresh as far as decor.

I was in on a night when wings were only 25 cents each.  The Jack Daniel's flavored wings were really watery on the inside and lacked flavor except for the sauce.  As I dipped the wings into the ranch dressing there was so much grease on the wings that the ranch dressing just slid off the wings.

They do have a pretty good beer list and I enjoyed my Odell's IPA for $4 on happy hour pricing.

Most of the 5 star reviews are from people with very few reviews so take them with a grain of salt!"}
{"text":"So I found a groupon for my family at Jack's Place. $50 for 4 people. Me, my girlfriend, and her father went and were planning on ordering food for our disabled grandmother to go once we were half done with ours so it would still be warm when we got home.

We arrived and despite 4 patrons at the bar being the only other people in the place, it took us a good hour and a half to receive our meals. My plate was minus a side of stone ground mustard that was supposed to come with it, and my girlfriend's salmon was late to the table. The waitress let us know \"it was the garlic mashed potatoes that were causing the meal to be late\" and we could choose between french fries and tator tots if we wanted her plate in a timely manner. French fries with blackened salmon?!

When asking for the bill, I asked the waitress to adjust the salmon plate to reflect the change in sides (fries were cheaper on the menu than the mashed potatoes) and when she returned she let us know that she was honoring the groupon \"despite us having 3 instead of 4 people\".

It WOULD have been food for 4 if we felt that the substandard service could make the fourth meal to go within a reasonable time and without having to change the menu because they can't cook mashed potatoes in the amount of time they cook both a steak and salmon.

This place was NOT worth the 15 minute drive and I am very happy I didn't have to pay full price for this. Avoid it if you are looking to eat a decent meal."}
{"text":"Good food, good jams, good people. Friendly to out of towners. Multiple TVs available with all sports packages."}
{"text":"JACKS Place is one of my favorite spots in the Scottsdale area. Very comfortable seating and great food specials. Friendly waitstaff and dope beats. Overall a solid spot to be."}
{"text":"We had gone here a few months ago and we enjoyed the food, service and drinks... 
This time not so much at all. We were there on a Thursday for a happy hour.... (not sure what's happy about it there) 1 other person at the bar... The bartender sure she was nice had no business being behind a bar. (20 years in the business so I'm speaking from experience)..... 
We ordered 2 appetizers. A quesadilla and 2 burger sliders... the quesadilla was horrible and the sliders were worse. We asked for an extra side of salsa and it was barely enough to cover the bottom of the  2 oz side. 
When 2 new customers came and sat at the bar we became an after thought. 
It makes me wonder if they are ever busy, (they weren't last time either) 
It's to bad because it has great decor, and set up."}
{"text":"Amazing food tonight. Tonya is the best. And the service was great. This place is a hidden treasure in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. If you're looking for a fun bar to watch a game, or a table to shoot pool on, Jacks Place is where you need to be. This bar has great staff and better food."}
{"text":"Good food, bartender girl was great! Owner has a real short mans complex and should stay as an owner and not as a get drunk patron trying to start fights."}
{"text":"No one seems to know what they're doing, they wouldn't honor our \"free appetizer\" card, the food was mediocre at best, the first beer I ordered (Ballast Point Pineapple Sculpin) tasted like dirty dish water, and it's an all male staff (aka bro central). No thanks."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere, and Milo makes some good drinks! I will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Thank you Alex for my new favorite drink!! Y'all need to see what Alex can do and order the Green Tea Cocktail !! Best I ever had!!"}
{"text":"First have to say they gotta have the coldest beer in Old Town. Sixteen drafts and I don't know how many bottled beer, but they'll find a beer you like. 
The decor is beautiful with a nice leather bar, reclaimed wood walls and tables, plenty of tvs for football season! They also have some fun games in the back, shuffleboard and darts. If you like shuffleboard this is the bar for you, they have a full length table, totally retro from the early eighties and it still works. 
Service is very attentive, and friendly. They get everyone at the bar talking and having a good time, the owner will frequently bring out samples of the food for people to snack on and get to check out what the kitchen can do. 
Now the kitchen isn't like other pubs, they are making everything from scratch, and are going it right. Instead of wings they have these drummetts that are smoked then grilled. Their mac and cheese is made with aged cheddar and is gooey and yummy. Awesome sliders made with Arizona beef, which I think is pretty great. I can't even remember what else we tried, but everything was so good! Fresh pretzels, guacamole with orange. Oh please try the tomatillo salsa. 
Overall I love this place and will be there on the regular. They made me feel welcomed, served me cold cold cold beer, and amazing food. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went to this place to watch a playoff game, menu was limited, food was marginal and service was terrible. The original waitress that took our first drink order never came back to our table once we sat down. We proceeded to just grab other waiters/waitresses when we needed them. All and all I will not be returning to Jacks Place. In a competitive restaurant/bar scene such as Scottsdale I can't imagine this place will be around come April unless they really figure some things out."}
{"text":"Just had the Bloody Mary with bacon/salt rim, as suggested by previous yelper...amazing! Also had the Wisconsin cheese curds, quesadilla, and edamame, all of which are absolutely amazing as well (especially true cheese curds)! The last thing I'd like to mention is the bartender. We've been in before and were blessed with Alex's presence, and what a blessing he truly is! But today, Pat was manning the bar and I have to say, as much as I appreciated Alex the initial time in, Pat had us rolling with laughter, was very entertaining, and I swear he doesn't know how to not smile! What a friendly establishment with great drinks and food! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My home away from home, and I wish I could say that was a joke. Furthermore, this is officially my first Yelp review. 
In all seriousness, Jacks Place to me is my favorite destination when going out. Whether I'm looking to meet the friends and head next door to Stand Up Scottsdale or hit the town, or if it's just a comfortable night of playing shuffleboard, drinking some of the best mixed drinks as well as coldest beers in town, while eating off their option filled, well priced, local ingredient filled, non bar food menu, Jacks Place is my destination. I also have to mention the happy hour specials, by far the best prices, with the best variety in town, and I know the towns happy hour menus (sadly some would say). On top of the happy hour, there are themed deals depending on the day! 
Honestly, hands down, Jacks Place is a gem, most people never find a locally owned establishment that they are proud to call home. I found mine, from the top down, Jeff and Mary (owners), Milo and Pat (bartenders), these fine people make me feel like family, and I truly feel the same way. So come on down, enjoy some Scottsdale uncharacteristically inexpensive drinks, extremely good food at an awesome price, in the company of some of the nicest people this town has to offer you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to experience new places and decided to stop in here on a weeknight. The place had pub appeal and the crowd seemed lively and nice. The crowd is more of a college type on that night. It was .25 wing night and we ordered a sample of all of them on the menu. The price was great.. But the wings were just so so. We had mixed drinks and the pour was pretty good. The waiter was very nice... But not that attentive. The place was slow and we had to go to the bar several times just to get service. We also order two salads and a grilled cheese. Needless to say the sandwich never arrived. We also ask several times for ranch with the wings that also never appeared. When we walked outside for a few minutes... There were two girls sitting on the bench smoking by the front door. I had my club soda glass in my hand and one of the girls in a derogatory tone... stated \"You can not bring alcohol outside\"! I said it was \"Club Soda\".. She stated \"Well I work here and wanted to make certain. ???

Overall the place has a cool Pub feel... And the food was ok... Will we be back? No... Would I recommend it? Yes. Just was not our crowd... So if you are 30 or younger... Looking for a laid back pub.. I would recommend it.  Sometimes a good waiter can get sidetracked... So do not judge our lack of service to be the norm in this place. And hey??? Pub Food is Pub Food! Normal menu is a little pricey... The menu is creative and interesting. But the specials are wonderful on pricing. And it was very clean

My husband did briefly bump into the owner at the bar... And he was very talkative and pleasant with my husband. Good luck to you and great success."}
{"text":"Milo gave the best service and most excellent comedy a customer could ask for. He provides real world solutions for your drink problems including drink whiskey when your friskey!!!"}
{"text":"Milo is an awesome bartender. Great conversationist and makes you feel at home. Also, they have Ballast Point Sculpin IPA on tap which is always a plus in my book. Had the cheese curds and they were awesome. I'm not sure what the dip was that came with them, but it seemed to be a chipotle mayo which was awesome and made for a great combination. Love it here."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the service. Our waiter, Milo, was very nice, honest, helpful, and on top of his game. Plus, when a dish came out incorrectly made, he more than took care of us, getting the dish fixed and comping it... it was more than awesome. The food here was more just ok. They had fairly good mac and cheese, their sliders were alright and their fish and chips were also decent, but nothing was fantastic. I will say their fries were super tasty and I ate waaay too many of them. I think they may still be working the kinks out of the kitchen. Also, the menu posted online is not the menu in the restaurant... I had come in thinking there'd be a wide array of burgers... not the case. Would I come back? If someone was having a function here, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but otherwise I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon football and visiting with friends.  Very nice atmosphere.  Pat was friendly and treated us very well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, draft beer menu is by far the best in town, attentive services, decent tv placement for games, all around solid place."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night. Called to see how late they were open. They said 11 p.m. we got there at 9:45 and they were no longer serving food or pouring drinks. Was a little upsetting to drive there to find out they were closing. Might check them out another time"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for! Chill place... not crowded... nice bartender... lots of tvs to catch whatever game you want... 16 beers on tap... nice brunch menu.. I ate the breakfast burrito with a blue moon... very tasty!"}
