{"text":"I live close to the Fusaro's on Richmond and have a standing brunch date with friends, so this review is based on over 15 dine-in experiences and a handful of take-out ones as well. 

I've never once been disappointed by the food at Fusaro's. I made a point of changing what I order each time (with the odd exception - I seem to come back over and over to their gnocchi...) and it's all been fantastic. if you're in the area and looking for amazing coffee, skip Tim Horton's and grab an Americano at Fusaro's instead. And add a Nutella cornetti for a small piece of heaven on earth.

For brunch, bacon & eggs are presented wonderfully and come with fruit salad and a coffee (for only $7!). If you're hungry, order the Calabrese - three pieces of hearty Italian bread with a poached egg and mozzarella cheese on each, surrounded by spicy sausage, and smothered in dee-lish marinara sauce. (Vegetarians, rejoice - they'll substitute the sausage for roasted eggplant instead!)

Lunch is generally either gnocchi (with rose sauce) or the special of the day. Again, I've literally never been disappointed with anything I've tried and I never leave hungry.
 
The staff are friendly, the space is beautiful, the portions are large, the prices are cheap, and the food is delectable - what more do you want?"}
{"text":"I've been going to Fusaro's for their espresso's every day for a month now and don't think I can go elsewhere. Their friendly staff might have something to do with it as well as the coffee. 

Just be warned that if you go at peak lunch hours there is always a long lineup and their food is a little expensive in my opinion. However, the price of their espresso's is very reasonable! 

I highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"The food is good enough I suppose, but I prefer my lunch to not come with a side of horrible attitude. We also wasted the better part of our lunch hour waiting for our sandwiches, which was fine, we had a glass of wine while we were waiting. When they finally gave us our order, it was completely wrong. They had mixed ours up with somebody else's, also fine, accidents happen. But when I went back to explain what had happened, the girl rolled her eyes at me, she didn't even apologize.  I don't understand why people flock to this place, when there are so many other friendly places around with much better service."}
{"text":"Fusaro is so close to work I often end up getting lunch there... It's great casual lunch experience with friendly staff. Panini, Pizza, Pasta & Salads are all made with fresh quality ingredients. I tend to rotate between all the items offered on the menu depending my appetite and mood, they really do have a great selection. Make sure to try out their tiramisu for dessert, it's a massive portion!"}
{"text":"I've been seeking a new lunch place in the King/Spadina area for a while and my co-worker suggested I check out Fusaro's.
Since I'm a diehard fan of sandwiches, I was interested in checking it out, and, let's just say, they didn't let me down! 
Fusaro's is an excellent place to go for fresh Italian food that includes everything from Salads to Pastas and a wide range of sandwiches.
Although there were several options, I chose the UNO Panini which came with salami, capicollo, mortadella, hot giardeniera,
provolone, and roasted garlic mayo. Let me tell you, this sandwich was \"out of this world\" delicious! The bread was excellent and I especially liked the kick of heat (from the hot giardeniera)!!!
You should definitely try this place out ASAP, but, make sure you get there a bit early, as it can get VERY busy! 
Once you taste their food, you'll understand why!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here during a recent visit to Toronto. The panino was among the best I've eaten anywhere!  Cool looking and casual atmosphere. And the clock set to Calabria time was a nice touch. Will come back here again."}
{"text":"Simplest delicious, fast and friendly service. What more do you need when it comes to casual dining?"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant for lunch. The specials menu I found to be a great value. I had the pasta from it - very tasty! Would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"My office hood is in serious need of good lunch spots. I'm sick of eating from the hot table at Sobeys. 

Checked out Fusaro's twice last week. 

Day One: Running errands at lunch, I popped in for some take out. Selected the sei panino ($8) which consisted of prosciutto, fresh tomatoes, basil, arugula, bocconcino, basil & olive oil. Grilled slightly, it was pretty perfect, salty, sweet, delicious.

Day Two: Met a friend who works in the area. I had the spinach salad ($10) which included: spinach, grilled chicken, mushrooms, panchetta with a light balsamic dressing. Was perfect. The salt from the panchetta worked well with the balsamic and earthy mushrooms and spinach.

Check them out if you are in the area, apparently their pastries in the morning are very good as well."}
{"text":"Been here twice, good both times. I ordered the sette panini today (smoked turkey, roasted red peppers, arugula, mustard mayo) with proscuitto (you can add extra ingredients for an extra cost, or a side salad). Very nice, perfect portion. Last time I ordered a pasta (don't remember the name) but it was also well done. Very nicely priced, decent portions, superb service, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat, love the warm atmosphere. Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed it, especially on a rainy day, going there made it much better. 

Food is delicious, service was great, ready to fill our water and serve more bread. We ordered Acritano and Tonnato. They had strong tastes which was really good, sauce made a nice dip for the bread as well. We had some Earl Grey tea after and relaxed for a bit before leaving and having a nice chat with the waitress.

Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Tiny piece of soggy chicken Parm with forgettable pasta accompaniment. $13 with a salad is not bad, but the food is definitely of a mass market uninspired variety. I wouldn't return... Well maybe to try a sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I work from home, this is my go-to lunch spot. I usually get the Due sandwich with a Chinotto soda.

It's really clean and modern inside, all the food looks good but I've only ever had the sandwiches. 

If you're looking for dry Italian food products, they have a large selection of those sorts of things, even 00 flour."}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to review Fusaro on Richmond for a very long time so here it is. A couple of months ago we reserved the whole restaurant for an intimate engagment party. Sandra, manager in charge of Fusaro Richmond location, helped us to coordinate a set menu that suited our budget. Our set menu included antipasto board to share as the appetizer, 3 main choices including the seafood parpadelle, chorizo rapini, and chicken scallopini, and tiramisu as the dessert. Not only did the food tasted exceptional but the presentation of the food was top notch. sandra and her staff went above and beyond and put detail to everything including printing up the dinner menus, to rearranging the set up of the restaurant to accomodate our guest of 15. Fusaro on Richmond is the perfect location for intimate dinner party and their staff will make sure your group is well taken care of. Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Great spot that offers really good food at a decent price.  Always busy so if you are in a hurry, might not be the place to get your lunch.

Nice that you can also purchase products such as olives, oil, flour and sweets.

The staff could be a bit friendlier at times (I've been going there regularly since they've openend and that's my only negative criticism). 

Exactly what the corner of Sherbourne and Richmond needed!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place; hip, casual and down-to-earth yet fine dining at the same time; great atmosphere and level of liveliness on a Friday night.
Super friendly and amazing customer service; delicious food!
A fine dining place yet unpretentious, with generous portions at lunch prices! (Entrees $9-$12).
This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. It really doesn't get better than this. 
The prosciutto pizza and white cream penne pasta were delicious.
An excellent place to go to for dinner."}
{"text":"A small well decorated hole in the wall that doesn't disappoint.
The secret to grate Italian is always to keep it fresh and simple and these guys have it down. 

Everything there is great and just the right size. The sandwiches, pizza and pasta make this my favourite lunchtime spot. 

Only a few critiques:
- The wait at peak hours gets a little nuts...but that's the cost of success. 
- I can't for the life of me understand why a place that has an authentic Italian menu can put a chicken wrap on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't see what is so great about this place. The Prosciutto Panini was OK, pizza was terrible: doughy and chewy. A cashier girl with heavy accent lacked customer service, no smile, no hello. We are not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great cool modern industrial looking italian restaurant.  I live around the corner and have been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Good quality, real italian food (ingrediants are all from italy), at decent prices.  everything is around $10, eat in or dine out.  My boyfriend and i dined in, and were serve fresh tosted bread drizzed in olives and seasoning."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten anything here other than their breakfast burrito which is AMAZING! It takes some time to make it because they make it fresh but it's definitely worth it. 
It's a small restaurant but friendly staff and always smells great when you go in."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Really tasty food. 

They also do catering, from which I've ordered a number of times for corporate luncheons. Good value for the quality and amount of food you get, and everyone is always very happy with the lunch. Food arrives on time, and is still hot when it's delivered."}
{"text":"My lady and I shared a pizza and pasta. Both were meatless and very tasty. The food took an unusually long time but the quality made up for it."}
{"text":"Great food but they mess up a lot!! 

My coworkers and I order from the Richmond location regularly and we often have to go back to get our orders corrected. 

I have a gluten allergy and more then once they have given me regular pasta. Luckily I noticed or I would have been very sick for several days.

We have also had a caterpillar and a lady bug in the Americana salad (separate occasions) and an elastic bands in a chicken wrap.

I know they're busy but that's just lazy!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastas at a very good place. Super cozy atmosphere to chit chat and catch up with friends"}
{"text":"Passed by this place everyday seeing line up for lunch. Today I decided to drop in for a quick bite. It was surprisingly satisfying.

Wide choice of Panini, fresh Salad and Pasta. They also displayed sample panini of the daily special, which are all amazing! This place has rather high quality authentic fresh italian food and goodies.

Wanted their sample panini, but all sold out by 2pm...  So I had Due Panini with Spicy salami, sun-dried tomato, black olive spread, red onion, goat cheese. So good for $7,5

The Coffee here was great too! Love the simple modern clean design."}
{"text":"Fusaro's is always a reliable bet for a quick lunch, either to bring back to the office or when meeting a friend or colleague for lunch. While the food is a little bit on the expensive, it's reliably tasty and filling. The ingredients always taste fresh and you can tell the dishes are made with care.

The restaurant is small and seats 10 or so people, but is nicely decorated and laid out. I've eaten in a few times and the food is always prepared quickly. It's not so much a table service restaurant but you're not paying premium prices so I don't mind at all.

In terms of take-out they use Ritual for pick-up orders and it's always ready a few minutes ahead of time. I order from here a few times a month and have never been disappointed. You can reliably get two days lunches out of one pasta dish if you're not too hungry, and their daily pasta special comes with a side salad and some bread for dipping - yum!

I have never tried their pizza or sandwiches but they always look and smell delicious. If you're looking for a reasonably-priced, tasty lunch in the area you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm at George Brown College, I always head to St. Lawrence Market. I wanted something different today so I decided to drop into Fusaro's. Am I ever glad I did!

I ordered a Tre Panini which is a tuna sandwich basically. It was very delicious as all the ingredients inside were very fresh - red peppers, tuna salad and the bread. A much better option than having a Timmies sandwich :). Price isn't that far off either. I'll be back here very soon!"}
{"text":"I can't get over how super noms the food at this place is. 

I got the pasta alla vodka, my favourite pasta dish of all time, and they do it beautifully. I went to this location Friday afternoon and the spadina location two weeks ago Saturday and at both locations, the quality and quantity was more than perfect for someone who eats a lot, plus for $15 for the meal, tax & tip, it can't be beat. The noodles were perfectly cooked, the sauce not overwhelming but the kinda graceful fullness that one gets when the dish was crafted with love. Lots of pancetta too, which was noms. 

Definitely will come back! Havent gone during their busy periods but i think thats helped to contribute to how quick and well made it was. This place is golden. Check it out, its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or casual dinner. 

Pizza is excellent but once was undercooked. 

Pasta was good but bread comes with olive oil already on it.

Little bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"After a day of biking, I was pretty hungry so I stopped  by Sherbourne and Richmond to see where I wanted to eat. There was a Tim Hortons, a Sandwich shop and an Italian restaurant and I had the feels for some Italian. When I entered, I was kindly greeted by staff and was seated. I got the Aglio Olio which had Goat Cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, goat cheese, chili flake aglio olio sauce and fusilli pasta. The staff started me off with some free bread and it was topped off with some dried herbs and olive oil. It literally has been a  long time since I've had olive oil and I tried my best to savour it, sadly I couldn't cause I was soo crushed from biking. When the pasta came, It was amazing really really good. At first I thought that the sun dried tomatoes were dried chilis but then realized that there weren't any dried chilis but instead dried tomatoes. The goat cheese is of course fatty and really good. The pasta was amazing and I tried my best to eat it all. The bill came to around $12-13 and it was worth it. I will come back next time to try it out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Best Italian experience in Toronto! Small price for a great, filling meal and great service. Always coming back."}
{"text":"I have been spying this place for a while especially since it is close to my home.  I finally went for lunch and there was a long line.  Admittedly, a nice lady kept telling me great things about the food while I waited in line so I stayed where I was.  I quickly realized that I could seat myself immediately but takeout and eat in orders go through the same line.  I was still not discouraged.  

I ordered the Lobster Pasta Al Forno - special of the day with a glass of wine.  They had wooden bench seating and I sat near the windows.  The wooden tables were sticky but I had hoped that it was from the cleaning agent as opposed to their general disregard for wiping tables.  My lunch came with a salad of mixed greens with tomatoes and cucumber, which was quite plentiful and delicious.  However, when it was time to get my order, two dour-looking servers dispassionately tried to give me Veal Parmesan pasta that I did not order.  After a bit of back and forth \"What I really ordered\" banter, they finally brought the food back and assured me my food order would come right up.  I waited a while on that pasta, which is a lot if I only had a short time for lunch.  I finally got my pasta which looked like a big gooey mess of sauce and indiscernible pasta.  After I took a few bites, I realized that it is actually big raviolis with lobster filling.  The pasta filling was fishy but without any taste of lobster and the pasta was overcooked.  I tasted very much like something I could have bought from the frozen food section.  Nothing special at all.  The sauce was good but I have a feeling it is the generic sauce that they use for every pasta that they serve.  

Overall, the service and food were disappointing and for a lunch spot it did not fill my heart with warmth and I am not motivated at all to try this place again.  I could have had the same experience had I microwaved some frozen ravioli meal from the nearby grocery."}
{"text":"Love this place, it became my usual lunch spot in Toronto. The Veal Cotoletta is my favorite, tasty breaded veal with a tomato-basil sauce and sauteed mushrooms. I've also tried a few of the other sandwiches and pastas, always consistently tasty. They have great coffee too!"}
{"text":"A cozy spot for simple, down-to-earth Italian fare at reasonable prices and generous portions. Didn't knock my socks off, but the value of a hearty, tasty meal goes a long way too. Thumbs up for quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years, and there was a time where we really loved it! Now however, they food quality and service seems to have really gone downhill. I walked in the other day during the afternoon (not the lunch rush, a bit later on) and all of the employees were literally standing around the cash register with their backs to the door talking. While I get that this was their downtime between lunch and dinner (I work in a restaurant as well), I think it looks pretty unprofessional to be standing at the front like that. When I asked if they had any more pizza slices, I was answered by one of the girls quite rudely that they didn't, and went on my way.

I get it, working in a dead restaurant is boring, so I was trying not to hold this against the place. I went there for carry out dinner last night however, and I think it's safe to say I'm done with this place. I ordered the chicken parm and salad for $13, as well as a pizza. The girl quoted me 15 minutes on the phone, which I knew would be inaccurate because I've gotten take out from Fusaro's many times. I went in after 20 minutes had passed, and she informed me that my pizza had been burnt on the first attempt, and that they were cooking another for me, it would just be 2 more minutes. No problem, again, I get it. After an additional ten minutes I got my food and left, not thinking much of it. As compensation for my wait time, the girls said that she had \"beefed up\" my salad, which I took to mean she added extra tomato and cucumber.

The salad however, is what has turned me off of this place. I went to eat it, and not only were the tomatoes mouldy (as in, blue mould was actually growing on them) but the cucumbers were completely rotten! In addition, at the bottom of the salad there was one, nasty, dried out piece of chicken, which should not have been in there at all. All in all, it was absolutely disgusting and I definitely won't be back for at least a good, long while!"}
{"text":"For an inexpensive, healthy lunch try their soup of the day and bread for $4. It tastes fresh and homemade, I've never been dissapointed. I've tried creme of portabello mushroom, vegetable curry and rice, and chicken vegetable. Vegetable curry is my favourite."}
{"text":"Definitely a staple spot for quick work-week lunches, Fusaro's does everything well.  I'm partial to their chicken panini, or Pollo Lu Paninu ( I think I'm getting that somewhat correct), but whatever you want to call it, it is definitely worth visiting for.  The basil pesto house mayo provides a nice kick and I fear that if I ever came across a jar of this goodness I'd dig in with a spoon.  But seriously Fusaro's is worth a try if you haven't been, and if you have I needn't convince you.  Its causally elegant, and is good for dine in or take-out options.  Get there early if you can on week days as there will inevitably be a throng of hungry patrons spilling out onto Richmond St. if you arrive anytime after 1230."}
{"text":"Great option for quick and reasonably priced Italian food in the area. Casual vibe, good quality food. I love stopping by here during the week when I'm feeling Italian but too lazy to cook and too lazy to dress up for a restaurant. Favourite dishes are the siciliana  and acritano pastas. Just wish this location was open on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service.  The pasta is always tasty and the salad fresh and hearty.  Really good coffee and cappuccinos.  Only complaint is the hours of operation, these guys are never open when we want dinner on a weekend."}
{"text":"Food is always good, fresh and well presented. It it's really good value too. Lunchtime can be really busy and I wish they were open Sunday's."}
{"text":"Love this little place close by our condo. It's a small little gem that seats about 10-15 people. A lot of customers also do take-out. The alcohol is cheap and the food/pasta is always fresh and delicious. Great value! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonable and fresh dinner.  Chicken parm was very good, veal parm slighty dry but nice flavor, charcuterie board was very good.  Service was very good and well timed throughout the dinner."}
{"text":"The food is good. the only thing i didn't like was:
1) to much garlic inside pasta
2) to much different ingredients inside the panini ( this means that some ingredients cover the taste of others)
But was good. Waiters are friendly and the price is good too."}
{"text":"If you want something that won't break the bank, Fusaro's is the place to go to. The pasta and paninis are all reasonably priced and just as good as higher end restaurants! I also like the fact that they come with complimentary salads! Not too keen on the lack of table service - you actually have to get up and fill your own glass yourself. Other than that, it's a great place to go to, especially for lunch. The place is nice decorated and there's free wifi too! Staff (despite the minimal table service) were friendly. I'll be coming back here again if I'm craving for some pasta!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a variety of food and the price are reasonable. We went their during busy hours but the wait weren't that long.They also serve you some delicious homemade bread with garlic and olive oil as appetizer!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fusaro's several times and bought their Pizza slices. First of all, the Pizzas are delicious.  They're only $5 a slice, and I think its fitting for the amount of pizza you get.  My only constructive criticism would be on how we have to ask for the \"number one\" slice or the \"number four\" slice.  Can I get a name for these pizzas please??   Choosing between plain cheese or pizzas that had spinach all over was not easy. I know these are vegan times, but nuts to spinach!  Everyone knows its all about kale now.  Keep spinach in a bowl under some croutons and it \"might\" still have a career next year. pfft! 4 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Fusaro's is a hidden gem in the east and west Toronto. Their anti-pasto is fantasticly delicious. The prochutto, cacciatore and la Bamba sauce spice things up. Their uno Panini is also a spicy delight. We love that is it higher Italian, at an affordable price in a cozy location. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A small Italian place with great atmosphere, friendly staff, and solid food! It was good to dine at a quite, cozy place on a Friday night. I was looking for something not too heavy, so I got a veal sandwich. It was simple yet on point! The salad on the side was fresh and well tossed. To make up for my \"healthy\" meal, we had to order a tiramisu. It was delicious! I could eat ten of them at one sitting. 

I like this location because it is quite, cozy, and close to where I am. The price here is very reasonable (everything is under $20). Overall, if you are looking for an affordable yet good Italian food, try this place out!"}
{"text":"This might be the best pizza I've had in Toronto...and I've had a lot of pizza in Toronto! Great value. Friendly service. If only they were open on weekends!"}
{"text":"The lunchtime service is HORRIBLE. Staff is confused and unorganized. I waited half an hour for a panini that never came. Avoid"}
{"text":"I love this place, it follows the authentic Italian style of using rich fresh ingredients in a creative way! Being athletic, I usually get the Tre panini for lunch, which mainly has tuna, oven roasted peppers, spinach, and bocconcini cheese. The tuna is a great fix for lunch being high in protein, while a bit of bocconcini makes the perfect bed for the tuna so it's not too dry. The sandwiches are also just the right size so they don't fill you up too much.

I'm extremely lucky that my new favourite cafe is located just around the corner from my work."}
{"text":"I came to Fusaro's last week with my colleagues for lunch. Had Acritano, which is penne with chicken, mushrooms and the most amazing white sauce. Incredible pasta! A must for all those who like white sauce pastas. Having said that my colleagues ordered Bologese and Alla vodka and they were pretty awesome!
Highly recommend this amazing restaurant! 
Great value for money!"}
{"text":"I don't see what is so good about this place.  The Penne and chicken parmigano is good but the portions are very small for what you pay.   While the chicken is an alright amount, the amount of pasta is really minuscule.

It is very oily, when you reheat it the next day it's drenched in oil.

Might as well go to East Side Marios it's about the same and you get bread and unlimited salad."}
{"text":"I've done a couple of take-outs from Fusaro's since my very first raving experience here. And the quality has definitely deteriorated. What a shame! I used to love the pasta here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite go-to lunch places in the city. Service is always quick, efficient, and friendly. Food is delicious, very generous portion size, for a reasonable price. If you are craving a heaping plate of pasta for lunch, head here! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved It.
Delicious pizza! Friendly atmosphere! Good prices too ) 
Very good vibe. Perfect for a casual lunch with a friend. 
Oh! and finish your meal with an espresso;)"}
{"text":"When I worked downtown, this would be my go-to place for lunch, and it's always got a long line at lunch. I've only ever had their tuna salad, but I will say that it is THE best tuna salad I've ever had (really, one of the best salads I've ever had, period--and, believe me, I'm not a fan of salads to begin with). I've tried re-creating this salad at home myself, and it just can't be done. I could have this salad every day during the work week, and enjoy it every single time (and I have, too!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic little Italian restaurant with wonderful service. The staff is great and always friendly. The restaurant itself is clean  and has a minimalist & modern decor. The reason I would give four stars rather than 5 is simply because the food isn't worth 5 stars. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful enough but coming from an Italian family, I had better pizza and pasta in the pasta. Definitely a great place to check out and have lunch at!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Our whole team ate it for lunch and loved it. Good option for a $10 to $12 lunch. I really liked the siciliana pasta."}
{"text":"Such a typical a American to order pizza I know. But it was Sooo delicious! Friendly environment low key spot."}
{"text":"Great food!! Went there this Saturday. Their pasta is very good!! Forgot the name. It was a Pork pasta. The service is exquisite with friendly people!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Fusaro's a great place to go for a solid, casual, hearty Italian meal. The prices are fantastic, the portions are great, and the service is friendly. My friend and I had the chicken parmesan, and I ended up taking some home to my husband! Thumbs up, Fusaro's!!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant today with two of my friends and was surprised to find out how tiny it is. It was super cute tho, probably about enough seats for 20 and luckily it wasn't busy. We ordered two pastas and a pizza and everything was delicious. So reasonably priced for the quality of ingredients and the portion size. The only hiccup was when I was ordering I asked the waitress if the pizza I wanted had meat on it and she said no. 15 minutes later I got a pizza with pepperoni on it. Thankfully, as soon as I told them they made a new one as I am a vegetarian but it was kind of annoying to have to wait while my friends already had their food. However, the pizza was delicious as well and I'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I've tried their pasta a few times and they are good (on the salty side) but this review is for brunch. Yes they never advertise it but they do have brunch on Saturday. I believe they open at 10am. Sun morning they are closed. But do call them before you go.

They used to have a small menu including a plate with two eggs bacon and fruits toast And a nice americano single shot for 8. It is the best value I could find in east end near me. And there's no line up.

Sadly they no longer offer that and this time I went it was some sort of ham and egg burrito with coffee for 10, and another two chioces. Written on a chulk board. But still, it is quiet, I never had to line up for breakfast (I don't know how PPL deal with that) and the food is good. The coffee is also delicious."}
{"text":"Reliably good pastas and sandwiches at fair prices. Good choice for lunch - either eat in or take out. But order carefully.  I find their Due (spicy salami) sandwich good, and their spicy sausage pasta reliably good.

The specials can be hit and miss, and I haven't really drilled down that far in the rest of the menu to say how good it is.

Also, be prepared to wait - there's usually about a 5 minute wait to order, and then another 10 minutes or so while they make your food (unless you order the pizza or frittata specials - those are faster)."}
{"text":"The food was just mediocre, I had bruschetta, salad, and two different pastas. The bruschetta was nothing special at all. The salad was actually not bad, one of the pasta was very undercooked; very hard to chew. And the other pasta was just okay. 

The atmosphere and the restaurant is nice enough. The food was just meh, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Best. Caesar salad. Ever.  Seriously, it's that good.  

Walking by Fusaro's on Richmond is like aromatherapy of all that is yummy and delicious.  I've sampled panini, chicken parm and the pasta which incidentally is my benchmark for the freshest pasta ever.

Fusaro's is like a themepark for my tastebuds.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I honestly love this place a lot. It's central, very reasonably priced and the food is great. Excellent pizza and sandwiches. It's a great grab and go place for lunch (they do Ritual pickup!), and they have a small seating area as well. Staff are friendly. I've been a few times, have had their pasta special (rotates daily) and also their mushroom salad (it's so good, I was mildly shocked at how flavourful and light it was), and friends have had the sandwiches which are super filling and delicious. Definitely my go-to for an Italian fix downtown."}
{"text":"I've been a regular to Fusaro's over the last couple years since I live and work in the neighbourhood. I've noticed firsthand that service and food quality has gone downhill in the last year especially. The first thing I noticed was how slow they've become to get orders done. They've made mistakes with my orders multiple times, the first time they forgot to put the chicken breast in my usual Pollo panini, second time I noticed half my pollo was a different sandwich, they must of switched the bottom half of the sandwich because I got roasted peppers and arugula instead of the usual spinach in my pollo. With the new menu launched in the summer, it was nice they gave a salad with our sandwich but bad idea on their part to put the salad and sandwich in the same box which caused the sandwich to get all soggy. I noticed today they were smart enough to start separating them. I preordered via Ritual today and got a pop up saying they were going to take longer because it was busy. When I walked in the restaurant was not busy at all AND they forgot half my order, so I had to sit for an extra 10 minutes to wait for the other wrap. The server was nice enough to offer me a free drink to make up for it. Food quality has gone down for sure, salad dressing was way too salty, and my sandwich didn't seem to taste as good as before, over dressed with pesto and mayo which was the case last time I ordered. I will say that their pastas and cookies still taste delicious but with all these problems, I'm losing faith in Fusaros. Hope they pull their act together."}
{"text":"this place makes a great rainy day stop especially when it's a weekend morning. i had the ability to order from the special colazione menu (basically, breakfast in italian). turned out to be one of the best meals i had while in toronto.

like most restaurants in downtown toronto, the place has limited seating options. it's maneuverable though. with such a small space, however, the attention you receive is really good. constant drink refills, quick service, etc.

we split the fiorentina and the calabrese (colazione). i'm not sure which was the better of the two. the fiorentina was the recommended dish by our waitress. the calabrese was unique though -- egg on top of a plate of crusty bread with spicy italian sausage in tomato sauce over that. yum. hardy. warming.

the tomato sauce is slightly too acidic for my taste but still enjoyed it quite a bit."}
