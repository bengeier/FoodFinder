{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The Chirashi bowl was well presented and filling. Fish was bold colored and fresh tasting! The clam hot pot was more than enough food for one person with plenty of clams. The meatball and chicken skewers were crispy and tender. The pork was very good as well, but a little tougher than the chicken and meatballs.   Warm and comfortable ambience, attentive and pleasant service, and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"the food is awesome ! The service is great ! Very friendly and helpful ! We ordered seafood soup and chicken wings plus the Salam cheek !  It was really yummy"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi restaurant. I'm a sushi lover and this is my favorite restaurant by far! I always come and order the Vegas Roll, Caterpillar Roll, spicy tuna roll. Pretty much anything you order on the menu is amazing! They have the best Egg rolls and Tempura vegetables. The service is phenomenal as well!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a weeknight and it wasn't super busy.  Great service and good food.  I overshot the parking lot and ended up parking in an apartment complex right next door.  No real way to turn around in that spot.  The Mirin Mackerel was very fishy but also very good in terms of the sauce. That said, I didn't finish it.  The Beef Bulgogi was fantastic. I'd come back for that dish alone.  It's a little tight in terms of entry for wheelchairs/powerchairs and there's not a ton of room to park next to booths, but you won't be too much in the way of others. It's doable but didn't seem super spacious."}
{"text":"This place has got some good hot pot. Happy hour specials aren't spectacular but I'd give it a four for the food. Boo-Yah"}
{"text":"Great sushi great environment and exceptional service! Would recommend to everyone. The chefs menu is a must try. The offerings are so unique. I had the tochagori roll (may have spelled wrong) and it was delicious. There was a slight smokey flavor to it that was unlike anything I've had. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was exceptional. The skewers were so good we ordered more and the bulgogi was good but it could have used more flavor. However the price for it was really good compared to other Korean restaurants. However don't order the shrimp tempura. It is way overpriced."}
{"text":"Came again, skewer and bowl are awesome! The mochi ice cream is aslo really nice! Will come again."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome.  What stated out as a late dinner date ended up being one of the funnest night date nights ever. The food was spot on. And the bar in the back was loads of fun with great Saki and karaoke till 2am. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here. Food is delicious! Service excellent! Great music! We had the bulgogi, and a hot pot with  pork, spam , kimchi, and lots of mushrooms! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual Saturday night dinner. Food was great, service was great! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. Like the spicy kimchi pot and seafood pot. Nice place. The free vegi spring rolls are also delicious. Taste like traditional korean food."}
{"text":"Love the hot pot here!  Fish is fresh.   Was here with friends and had a good time. The menu is an interesting blend of traditional and reimagined. The fusion aspects of the cuisine are creative and certainly worth a try! Come out and give it a shot! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The white rice was excellent. The Bulgogi and Eel were also very delicious. I recommend coming here if you are craving good Asian food."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm surprised by all of the good reviews for this place. My bf and I decided to give this a place a try since it's fairly new to the neighborhood, and it was the most bizarre dining experience that either one of us have ever had. Our server was nice.... But the menu... I shudder a little just thinking about it. It had everything on it from a quesadilla to ketchup covered spam. Not being totally scared off after viewing the menu, we decided to order several things to give it a try. We ordered some steak kabobs and chicken skewers to start. The steak kabob was neither a steak nor a kabob. What was brought to us was a hamburger patty covered in what appeared to be teriyaki sauce with a little wooden fork stuck in the middle. Again, it was a hamburger patty.... and didn't taste like a very good quality one either. Feeling adventurous we pressed on and tried the chicken skewers. These didn't taste bad, but were definitely the gristly parts of a chicken that you wouldn't normally want to eat. Unfortunately we had already put in an order for an entree, we even were talking about just asking for the bill and canceling the entree, but right as we were going to ask for the check, our food came out of the kitchen. This is the ONE instance where I wish the service had been terrible and the wait long. But unfortunately, like I already stated, the wait staff was great. Stuck at this point, we faced our entree (which was one of their signature dishes, the Kkanpungi). We both hesitantly dug in, and were mildly surprised. The chicken quality was better than the skewers we had already had and the flavor wasn't terrible. It was coated in layer after layer of sugary sweet sauce though, and we could only eat a couple pieces each before we threw in the towel, asked for the check, and promised each other we would never come back to this place and ONLY recommend it to our mortal enemies."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to be for Asian fusion, food has exquisite flavors.  Staff very good.  Will come back next time in Scottsdale!!  Loved it"}
{"text":"The sweet & spicy fried chicken is really good, and they're pork and chicken skewers are also really good"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from New Mexico and found this place on Yelp.  How could we pass up such excellent reviews  They are right, some of the best we've had.  Well be back!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What can I say ?! This place is amazing. Joline our waitress was courteous and attentive . She answered all the questions I had about the menu. I'm usually very reluctant to try new places but something about the unique name caught my attention.  I will definitely tell the hood and the big homies about it. PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"This was a 4 star a couple nights ago. I went in and ordered the Pork Lettuce wraps. They were great. The service was a little slow but nothing horrible.  I returned tonight planning on trying the Chicken lettuce wraps. I should have stuck to my plan. I ended up ordering the Scallops Dynamite (based on the servers recommendation) It was basically a plate of cheese over vegetables with the smallest scallops is have ever seen. It must be some pretty high grade cheese for the price. It did not taste bad but entirely too much cheese and they could up the quality of the seafood in it.   In the end I will probably go back eventually and try something else as it is a clean place and the staff has been decent but I will never order that again."}
{"text":"Went there last night with friends, reserved a table, and they were not kidding when they said you should bring friends to sample lots of food! We all wanted in each other's plates. The service was pleasant and patient when we ordered multiple times instead of all in one go. Was really a great environment. What led me here was all the pictures on yelp but sad to say I was having too much fun I forgot to snap a lot of pics to share."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Definitely coming back. The wait was not long and the waiter was super nice and funny!! The food was one of the best food places I've ever been too!! It's in a great area!! The people who work here are really nice and funny! This is a great place for kids and adults!! The food comes really fast and it was one of the best restaurants I've ever been too!! The mochi did not have the best consistency but it was pretty goodIf I am ever looking for a place to eat, this would definitely be one of my first picks!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great restaurant with affordable happy hour! Write a review and get a free gyoza and/or mochi Ice cream :)  The menu is filled with variety from skewers to delicious hot pot options; they also have poke bowls! The prices are definitely worth the drive and time. Happy hour is until 7pm! I would definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Try the meatballs and,the jalapeño Vegas Roll. Delish! Dos XX mug just $2.95. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals! Would highly recommend the cold happy hour sake option.  Wouldn't recommend the sushi burrito"}
{"text":"Came late on a Saturday and split a bunch of appetizers and other small bites. The  buttered corn and chili garlic edamame were both delicious! The egg rolls were mediocre. We tried both asparagus and garlic skewers -- highly recommended the asparagus! The garlic was oddly flavorless. We topped it off with veggie tempura and plain old rice, and both were very tasty. (Yes, the plain rice was noteworthy.)   Can't speak to the entrees, but definitely recommend for this tapas-like experience."}
{"text":"Great food. The Bulgogi and the Veggie eggrolles are bomb. The service is always great. Today James served us. He was very attentive to our needs and provided stellar service!"}
{"text":"When I first visited this restaurant, I realized that I'd been there before, years back. Back then, it was an Italian place, and my husband had taken me there for one of our first dates. It's sad to see a restaurant my husband grew up attending vanish, but I am glad that the building is still here and that such a nice restaurant moved in. The inside has been refurbished to look very elegant and comfortable. Also, the soy sauce containers have adorable cats on them. Obviously a sign of a quality restaurant.   We visited during happy hour and ordered a couple rolls from the happy hour menu. A little more variety on the happy hour menu would be nice, but the rolls were tasty. The spicy salmon was a little spicier than I prefer spicy salmon to be. I didn't try the non-sushi options, which make up a large part of their menu, but I might try them sometime if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"All the food here is good. Some of my favorite things are the salmon sashimi, mushroom skewers, and tofu hot pot but like I said all the food tastes good. They have all the soju flavors and a variety of beers/sake. The main seating area is dark, and has a nice, clean ambience. There is also happy hour from 4-7 then 9-11. The back bar has happy hour all day! Ask for Jojo; she is the best."}
{"text":"I have been here for several times, fried squids leg here is pretty good! Good place to hav"}
{"text":"Food is very reasonably priced and tasted awesome! First time coming here and had a great experience. JoJo our waitress was super nice and helpful! Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 signature rolls and a Gyoza appetizer and everything was amazing. We loved everything and the service was great. Nice atmosphere and clean place. I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The enviroment here is so good. The food is delicious. It's really suit for friends' metting. I love it?"}
{"text":"Fast service,  friendly waitstaff and great food!  What more could you ask for!? The gyoza is soooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"A great addition to our neighborhood eating places. Their Asian (Japanese / Korean inspired ) dishes are very tasty and reasonably priced. Service is good and attentive. Definitely a good alternative when looking for Asian cuisine with a good drink."}
{"text":"Good food, relaxing atmosphere. Great happy hour, swing in for some grub. Got jammbbong hot pot and some sushi, all the food was delivered quick and they have great deals"}
{"text":"Started with excellent service at the bar for awesome happy hour then continued with delicious apps skewers, seaweed salad and edamame!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Taste was excellent. Service was excellent as well! The wings have a unique taste which reminds me something we have in China. We had a wonderful time at this place!"}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. The sushi is very authentic. I really recommend the soft ahell crab. It also opens till very late. So a really good place to come to if you are hungry at night."}
{"text":"The environment of the restaurant is so comfortable and the food is so delicious, my first time but I'm coming again for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious and good prices too! Great service!!! The sushi is unique and the most delicious I've had in the city! The service is very prompt and a great atmosphere! Perfect for a date night or a hang out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe and great food. Clean and fresh ingredients- loved it. i highly recommend the teriyaki salmon salad and the tuna avocado sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Chuey is the shit! Awesome food. They are super willing to accommodate my vegan requests. Will be back soon for some shishito peppers & sake bombers!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place. Delicious food and great prices. My girlfriend and I both enjoy this Asian delight."}
{"text":"Cleaned up pretty well! Hot pot was by far my favorite. The sushi was decent and the sake bomb all day deal was da bomb.com. Would definitely recommend this place and will come back. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Been a couple times now to the restaurant side. Still haven't checked out the bar. I actually didn't even know the bar was there until the last time I went! I was wondering why there was so many cars parked in the lot, but only a few in the restaurant. Anyway to the food. I liked it. The edamame and sushi has always been tasty. They also got some good happy hour specials on food and drinks. It's also a really nice atmosphere and the service has always been great. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant by far. Always so fresh and excellent service. The best sushi rolls are the Vegas, Angry caterpillar roll and the spicy tuna roll. The chicken skewers are very good as well as the egg rolls and green tea mochi ice cream. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were surprised to find an izakaya place inPhoenix. The menu is a little bit different from what we normally get from an izakaya place but everything we got was good. Liked the poke bowl with salmon and the octopus salad. Fish was fresh and the sauce was delicious. We also got yuki with the meal. Sweet and sour which was a great addition to the meal"}
{"text":"Ambiance is amazing, came here with friends.  The service was good. Good sake and beer selection.  The music was very nice.  Food is great and a nice selection of beers. Love their concept of a restaurant one side and a karaoke bar on the other. Also in a great location to uber. Just love it for both just a quick dinner or a night out. A must check out place."}
{"text":"I love their vegetarian options! Agedashi tofu and green roll are my favorite! My boyfriend and I always use to go to kabuki for Asian cuisine cravings but after coming across this gem of a restaurant it's our new place. The prices are great the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"I love their food here. They have alot of good options like the Khunpangi and the hot pots. I like that their kitchen closes very late and it makes it an easy choice when going out for late night dining. Their portions are also really good at semi-decent prices."}
{"text":"This place has the best Las Vegas rolls! The normal one is awesome but the jalapeño Las Vegas roll is amazing! I come here just for that !"}
{"text":"This place has great ambience and even better food.  The chef omakase roll was great and they worked aroubd our food allergies!!"}
{"text":"Extremely impressive!! They deserve more attention. It was not that busy when I was there. But the food was fantastic, from the quail egg skewer to the Bulgogi hot pot, savory, fresh and super delicious. Moreover they were all the choices from my server Sami picked out for us. That was a great first experience I had at Zu Izakaya. You should try!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food was served quick and hot. Very tasty and the service was good. Atmosphere is wonderful as well. The highlights were definitely the cheesy corn and bulgogi tacos. Definitly worth trying."}
{"text":"Amazing service and spectacular good!  I recommend anyone in the area to stop at this place for a great time!"}
{"text":"Really great service and food! My favorites so far are the chili garlic edamame and Kkanpungi (Korean style fried chicken). The actual izakaya skewer menu is not super great but everything else awesome about this place makes up for it. I've only sat in the back bar area on Saturday nights and the cheap Sapporo, diverse sake menu, and silly karaoke make for great fun :)"}
{"text":"This place has some of the most amazing flavorful food I've ever had without breaking the bank. We came here for reverse happy hour and you just can't beat $3 sapparo beers along with $7 sake bombers. The portions are huge I would suggest to share the bowls for sure. Service was excellent. We definitely can't wait to go back because there was a lot to choose from!"}
{"text":"Try the coconut curry chicken pot. It's amazing. Big enough to share. Very nice staff and pleasant environment. Rice was also delish. Mochi ice cream for desert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very clean decor. Dark and fun. Ordered bulgogi hotpot, and this thing rocks. Taste just like how mom used to make it back home in Korea. Awesome. Kalbi is well marinated. Pretty awesome"}
{"text":"They completely remodeled from the restaurant it was before and did a great job.  The food is great and reasonably and a very good variety.  The owner  is a really nice guy came over and introduced himself.  I would definetly go back and  recommend it."}
{"text":"Saw that the Italian place across the street has turned into an Asian fusion restaurant. Well I just finished work and was hungry so I dropped in. Place has just opened and looks like I'm one of the first people in.  Ordered myself a beer and some udon. Udon was very delicious especially after a long day of work (got an add of chicken that was worth it). Beer prices are reasonable and it's right across the street. I'm coming back for sure. FYI looks like Asian fusion with the fusion being mostly Korean."}
{"text":"Very good service and atmosphere. I had sushi and it was delicious and fresh. I tried my buddies hot pot which was also delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!  Great food, and bartenders are really nice."}
{"text":"There  are delicious SUSHI and KOREAN  HOTPOT! SAlmon sushi  and  chef signature  roll are strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time in and overall atmosphere were good. The decor is somewhat typical sushi bar. Good location and easy parking. Ordered couple of skewers, a hot pot, rolls and side dishes, and honestly the foods were not that good except skewers. I've grown up with korean/japanes foods but the quality in the place is kind of disappointing. Staffs were very friendly but not well trained, especially for details in menu.  I could bump them up to 3 stars but young staffs made a noise at the corner of the restaurant all the time, which was so annoying"}
{"text":"logan is the shit!! visit him frequently during the week. great atmosphere and customer service. food is great as well. you have to check it out"}
{"text":"Free Gyoza if you check in with Yelp. The staff is friendly and our food came out fast. Good presentation."}
{"text":"Extremely good food and nice service. Environment very nice. Recommend fresh eel grill and the very tasty quail egg skewers!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was really good! Had such a great dinner. The food was well presented beautifully. Everything tasted delicious. I'm really pleased with this place overall and would highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great selection of sake and a decent happy hour. One of the best philly rolls I've had in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Jojo had amazing recommendations and very friendly! I recommend the jalapeno Vegas roll."}
{"text":"This is a great place for friends meeting, the food choices is a lot, and all of them are delicious, We are super Asian food lover, recommend here!"}
{"text":"We came in for the happy hour and it did not dissapoint. Decent select for happy hour and it goes till 7! Good service and food came out very fast. None of us had been here before and we would certainly come back.   There is plenty of parking and easy to get to. Also, they have some poppin music is you don't mind it. Not too loud that you need earplugs."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Las Vegas rolls. Food is really good in general. I enjoy the atmosphere around here. Price is nice as well."}
{"text":"The food is great!! I love the authentic Japanese food and there food always tastes very good. I will continue to come to this place!"}
{"text":"Our first time eating and I must say. This place makes good food. We ordered the Bulgogi, Curry hot pot, Meat ball skewer, Seaweed salad, Kkunpunpi and Galbi are good. They are all excellent. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had jjambong pot. Chicken skewer. Bulgogi dynamite roll, and rolled egg. Everything was very delicious and our server was so kind. Service. Food. And atmosphere was good enough. I will come back to try different food here."}
{"text":"Really nice place, food is great! I ordered the Korean style hot pot and  Alaska roll, yummy! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great family style and reasonable prices.  Surprised to find authentic izakaya in Arizona.  Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing and didn't expect it. We had lots of great shrimp and sushi.  My favorite was the lollipops and tuna sashimi with Wasabi sauce! Also the staff was great...thanks Jo Jo your awesome!"}
{"text":"The philly roll had extremely flavorful fresh salmon and even my picky toddler loved the Vegas roll. Take-out is fast for two rolls. It was ready in 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing. The vibe is really chill and relaxing. And the wasabi is different and better than any place I've been. I ordered the ebi mayo and shrimp tempura roll. The ebi mayo was real fresh and crispy. The shrimp tempura roll was a lot bigger than expected and tasted great. The prices were pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Great spot with great food but the best part is the bar in the back. It's a tucked away little gem with a great little atmosphere! And they have a great karaoke catalogue."}
{"text":"for the price it was good Service was good  nice ambience great music playing favorite thing I ate was the shrimp tempura"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm Zu Izakaya! Open late with reverse happy hour and great service! Specials when you review them on yelp and when you come in between 9-11 pm. Great addition to the Phx-area Japanese offerings."}
{"text":"Try the spicy tuna roll, it's incredible. The lighting is great for insta pics (highly recommend happy hour lighting till about 7). The ambience is nice and relaxing with a good music mix.  Also one of the few places where you can find mochi ice cream which is love itself in small, mouthwatering morsels."}
{"text":"I will be back! Finally a decent izakaya spot in tempe! The grilled skewers were on point #proteins"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really like this place. Great happy hour and the food is pretty good. Some of the best egg rolls ever. My only reason not to give 5 stars is that they don't have many non shellfish or pork options. Seeing as how we don't eat pork or shellfish, it can be hard to find new foods here. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day with a friend's family, and it is really good.  The hot pots are big and delicious.  The gyoza was amazing...we ordered three pots, and the galbi is delicious.  They have a solid sake menu and good beers.  I highly recommend this place...it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great hot pots! Try the coconut curry and bulgogi mushroom! The service was quick and service was attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi, which was amazing. My husband got the marinated short ribs, which were also very good. They're a bit fatty, so if you don't enjoy that type of thing... beware! The chicken skewers and veggie egg rolls were also amazing. The service was 10/10. Kudos to our server, Kevin, for making our experience memorable!"}
{"text":"Zu was a wonderful surprise and the happy hour options were great. The Vegas roll and spicy tuna roll were wonderful and the presentation was very artful. Happy hour is every day from 4p-7p and 9p-11p.  Our waitress(es?) were extra attentive and provided us with everything we needed to enjoy our evening.  We'll definitely come again for the hot pots and chili garlic edamame."}
{"text":"Just got back from here and we enjoyed everything! We walked in at 11pm and were the only ones there, I started to second guess myself.   Our server was nice and let us order off happy hour menu because we walked in when it was ending.  We had 5 sorts of skewers: pork, chicken, meatball, steak and sausage. My favorites were the pork and chicken, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Other items we ordered was steamed egg, spam and cheese katsu, bulgogi tacos, kimchi tacos and spicy pork. We enjoyed just about all of them, especially the tacos. Again I was hesitant because I figured they would have been soft corn tortillas or so, but they were hard shell. First bite and I was hooked, the shell was light and crisp, it complimented the contents. Kimchi tacos were surprisingly good with the guacamole too. The fresh kimchi was great as well because it was spicy!   I am definitely coming back. I have been to a similar concept in Tempe, but I didn't feel compelled to go home and immediately write a review like this place (and that was over a year ago). Hopefully they will add more exciting options to the skewer list!"}
{"text":"Came to the area for business trip and find this place for dinner. Very nice environment with polite service."}
{"text":"Loved the gyoza and the sushi.  We ordered the gyoza for our appetizer and it was very hot and fresh.   Happy hour discounted (4-7pm, 9-11pm) specialties were delicious.     Loved the jalapeno Vegas roll. The jalapenos were freshly fried and not too spicy.  Rice  in the sushi  was quite good, not just an afterthought."}
{"text":"Friendly service! A little strange to have Disney songs in the background, but dim lighting gives the place a nice feel. Food was decent. Didn't get a hot pot today but have in the past and they're super good and big enough for two people!"}
{"text":"Sat down in the bar. Beer, sake, appetizers, food and service has proved chill and comfortable."}
{"text":"My first time here & wow this place was f****g amazing! My server was Joline & I highly recommend her . She suggested the chicken, shrimp & shishito peppers skewers, tuna sashimi & marinated galbi. Damn son! 10/10 on the food! & they have Echigo beer !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Always has the best sushi and relaxing atmosphere. Great date night place!"}
{"text":"Seafood Alfredo udon is to die for. Sounds odd but is so worth it. A server recommended it when it was my first time at the restaurant and I never looked back. She went through the entire menu with me and my boyfriend. She told us that the oddball item on the menu is this Alfredo udon but highly recommended it. Of course we had to get it and I've come back just for it ever since!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is awesome. The lightening is great for a date! The food was even better! You have to go during happy hour. Such great deals!!! Service is awesome also. Very easy parking. Will definitely come back soon! Best sushi in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"So close to our new place we had to try it after seeing it driving by! Gyoza is amazing and there happy hour is perfect:)"}
{"text":"We are always looking for an authentic Korean  place and we finally found it! Awesome service and great food! Also its very affordable!!"}
{"text":"Really nice sushi. It is our first time and we really liked here! Fresh food, & nice environment!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Spicy Chili Shrimp & Seaweed Salad and they were delicious.The service was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great prices ! extra large servings and unique large different menu with a creative twist to all dishes different than all sushi places around here !!!"}
{"text":"old place? that we always come here, like the hot pot best........ but I still need to write a lot of things to finish this review."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place always great service and the food is amazing with good prices I deff recommend this place if you are craving sushi"}
{"text":"Excellent late night service. Very accommodating and late happy hour is always a plus in the bar! Butter Corn and the Chicken skewers are a must. The gyoza and egg rolls were also very good. I could not have been happier with the experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and husband for Mother's Day and I'm so glad we did! The yellowtail sashimi was buttery rich. The seafood appetizer was a wonderful combination of grilled scallops, shrimp, asparagus, and fried soft-shell crab. The coconut chicken curry oot was amazing and the staff were courteous and friendly. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. The waiter got us water immediately. Gave us time to look over the menu but didn't make us wait too light to order. During our meal he came by and refilled our water frequently and asked about the food.  I had the sushi burrito which was really tasty but not very filling. I also had the chicken skewer which was excellent as well. Overall the food tasted great and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"For a city without much Asians and super late night, this is a good spot. Although I'd recommend the hot pot section as those are more authentic Korean dishes and the place is run by Koreans. The grill pork, meat ball, soft shell crabs and salmon Kama are all pretty good. I'd recommend this place as there's a significant lack of Korean food in Phoenix, especially the informal casual drink Korean food that they offer in their hot pot section."}
{"text":"Super happy hour deals and fun karaoke in the bar area (separate from the main dining area).   The beef bulgogi is to DIE for... And the beef and veggie udon were great, too!  Highly recommended!  They are the same folks who run Bei!"}
{"text":"We tried the Jjambbong hot pot (Korean broth with seafood), the shishito peppers and chicken skewers and they were all very good. Great place to order a few dishes for the table and share."}
{"text":"Our waitress gave great service and our sushi came out wonderfully. One of my favorite dishes was the poke bowl with salmon. I would recommend this place to my friends if they visit here"}
{"text":"Updated five stars for happy hour on Friday! Food has been on point every time we came here. Definitely a go to spot when out of ideas where to go."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and atmosphere. We ordered the Chefs special pick and we were amazed at how much we DID actually like Fresh Octopus knowing now how it's supposed to taste. And the Sake, very educational to learn most places serve 'cheep' hot sake to cover 'the inferior taste'. When you taste their selection here, you'll agree. Go for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place! My friend and I got the spicy yellowtail roll, tuna tartare, and bulgogi mushroom pot. The pot was more than enough for two. The tuna tartare came with a quail egg and Asian pear. It was good, the atmosphere was nice, and we came after a jiujitsu class so we enthusiastically devoured it all. Very satisfying!  I also totally want their cat-themed soy sauce containers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  Everything we ordered was so good. Edamame, Calamari, Pork Gyoza Hot Pot and not one but two orders of Red Tuna Sashimi. The first order was so good, we had to get another!!  The Gyoza outside (noodle or pasta) was so tender, and the filling was just right. My husband adds salt or pepper or soy to everything. He mentioned that he just didn't feel it was needed. It was perfect. Not to say it was salty, it wasn't. It was just perfectly seasoned broth.  I had the White Peach Sake and my husband had Asahi beer. Both very good.  The service was actually excellent. The waiter was there when we needed him, but didn't hover. We couldn't have asked for better.  I think we have to go back here before leaving this time, and when we visit again!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to grab some sushi for dinner tonight and ended up here. The food was fresh and  and I'm not a huge sushi fan, so it surprised me! The spicy pork is what we ordered and it was delicious. The music was on point and the atmosphere was great also. Jojo was our server and she was so personable and we will definitely be back because of how great the service was. She was dope! We will be back. Will definitely recommend this place from now on!! It's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Great yakitori!   Reminds me of a spot we used to go to all the time in LA. Ordered the bulgogi and it was more than enough to share with my girlfriend.   Missed happy hour by a couple of minutes but it's all good. Definately coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Great atmosphere! The Bulgogi is really good and the hot pots have really good portions."}
{"text":"1.Good taste nomnomnom 2.well decorate  3.fine atmosphere  In sum, I recommend this amazing place to hang out with friends after work."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibes, great service. Great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy a few sake bombs.  Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great music and a welcoming ambiance make this a perfect date night restaurant. Fantastic service, sushi, and sake!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves at Zu Izakaya the other night at 10 pm while trying to find something open late.  And what a find it was - Japanese/ Korean comfort food done right!  The Nagasaki seafood hot pot was large enough to be shared between the four of us.  With a rich Tonkotsu broth, tender scallops, clams, mussels  and shrimp the only improvement would be additional ramen as the broth was a bit too salty without that balance.  It was accompanied by a bowl of rice.  The bulgogi was smoky and perfectly grilled.  The coating (not breading as sometimes seems to be the case) on the tempura vegetable was so thin, light, and crispy it shatters between your teeth and flavorful enough I didn't even  need the dipping sauce.  Fantastic.  Besides excellent food, good service and a relaxing ambience (Nora Jones playing in the background) they're open for late night cravings til 1 am every night except Sundays."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Everything is good. Food is delicious. Highly recommend the chicken skewers. If you looking for sweet wine, definitely check out the Takari. Our waitress Jojo was awesome. She was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Service was great super fast. Servers were considerate for my gf diet of gluten free. Large menu slightly confusing but happy hour till 7."}
{"text":"Great eel salad could smell as soon as it was done . Vegas jalapeño roll unreal good , presentation was also top notch .  Elisa is a great server , just a simple place with a good location , cool building and great vibe.  Very happy will be back !"}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and sushimi. Will definitely come back when I will come back to Arizona. Thank you for a great experience and hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service. Very patient with us. And the food was good :) JoJo is an excellent server."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here for the reverse happy hour. We wanted drinks and food but wanted to avoid Mill Ave. I don't know why I didn't come here sooner. The place has good ambience inside.   We ordered crab cakes and it was a fairly generous potion for an appetizer. It has a great crab flavor. The spicy mayo it comes with is definitely good.   Mellow enough to not be overwhelmed on a weekend but a great place to grab a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"The is my new favorite asian place to eat. The desert is awesome! The coconut chicken curry is my most favorite meal right now. Everything so far has been amazing, full of flavor!! Fyi the meatballs are good too ^_-"}
{"text":"Best agedashi tofu I've had! Broth is complex and the tofu is cut to my favorite size so that it's still crisp on the outside.  Also had the salmon kama, excellent flavor and char on that.   Bulgogi is on the sweeter side and comes with a lot of caramelized onions.  Customer service is excellent. I asked the server for her favorite dishes since this is my first time here.  We will definitely be back! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour place. Drinks and meat on a stick is the way to go. Sushi is great too!"}
{"text":"What a great meal. Came here with 2 others and enjoyed several small plates and 2 meals. The happy hour prices were great and I loved the curry. We will definitely be back. We had very good service and a free saki shot for checking in on Yelp =)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I really enjoyed the edamame and the sushi was so fresh!!! The salmon salad was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Great Korean/Japanese food in Arizona!!! Delicious food with reasonable price and great service! Definitely coming back.  Really enjoyed soft tofu soup!"}
{"text":"Tried some appetizers, salads, and a few grill items - everything was great.  Looking forward to going back and trying one of the hot pots!"}
{"text":"I love the cat soy sauce jars! The layout of the restaurant is strange and I don't care for the sports bar side; was hoping for a sushi chef. The portions are beautiful and delicious! I will definitely be back, was just not my typical sushi visit. Also glad they have a patio to get some air or puff something else! :)"}
{"text":"Stellar service; AWFUL sushi. The servers and chef were highly attentive and focused on giving great service. However, the food I experienced here ranged from mediocre to awful. I've had sushi from NYC to San Fran that ranged from amazing to acceptable quality. While the edamame was mediocre and somewhat mushy, the sushi here was just BAD quality. Fishy and stanky. I spat most of it out into a napkin as the smell and taste were nauseating. I'm a coward because I couldn't tell them this to their desperately hopeful faces. Perhaps the other food is better -- I hope it is because they sincerely want this to work. BUT DON'T GO HERE FOR SUSHI."}
{"text":"Zu Izakaya's ahi poke is delicious. The flavor of the marinade is the best I have had. The portion is generous with a great combination of seaweed salad, crab, daikon, ahi over rice garnished with cucumber and roasted seaweed."}
{"text":"I've ordered the sushi burrito every time I've gone here because I can't stop thinking about it. I know it's unconventional, but who cares? You can't go wrong with the hot pots either and if the price is intimidating, don't worry, it's big enough to share with 2-3 people (depending on which one you get) and you can fill in the rest of your hunger with their skewer options.  My favorites are the asparagus, mushroom, and zucchini.  That bbq sauce they drizzle on is heavenly. I even poured what was left on the plate over my white rice. Oh, and for someone (like me) who orders veggie tempura for the sweet potatoes, rejoice! - they have it as an order all by itself. Perfect. Poke salad was good too, a bit too much rice...but taste was on point. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great modern, Japanese/Korean fusion restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and sushi was fresh .. Great service and ambiance .. I'm coming back here"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour. Food is definitely a good value and the service has been very attentive both times we've come in.  Good place for a drink or two after work or a reverse happy hour later in the evening."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was surprised to suddenly see the old Italian restaurant that had been there forever replaced with this rather interesting new option.  Decided to check it out when my wife had some friends for dinner and I needed a break - so glad I did and will definitely be back.  Very friendly staff and the interior redesign/redecorate is comfortable and relaxing.  Tried a small bottle of sake which was very good - I've not been exposed to this too much so it was interesting to try - they have a decent selection and bottles are 50% off during happy hour.  They serve a variety of small dishes - I had the quail eggs which were so tasty and a chicken skewer dish and edamame both of which were also very good.  I finished up with the squid legs which were fine, but probably won't have them again. Overall a very enjoyable experience with interesting food options and a relaxed and friendly ambience."}
{"text":"The quiet atmosphere (during mid-week early happy hour) was pleasant, and the authentic yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) was just like I had when I lived in Japan.  The salmon sashimi was excellent!  I will be back!  Next time I want try their miso soup and a salad."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant and bar in the area. The food is delicious! I've had the sushi burrito, Unagi, and gyoza - all delicious. But honestly, the best part is the bar in the back where they have karaoke, drinks for an affordable price, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Hard to spell but parking is plentiful. Happy hour is from 4-7 and 7-close. And they open at 4. Order off the appetizer menu. Ask for Kevin or Jojo."}
{"text":"Great location and value with a wide selection of happy hour items and Korean/Japanese mixed in. Excellent pork skewer and they offer a lot of stuff in the hot pot"}
{"text":"In town for the day and was looking for quality sushi without breaking the bank and this place did not disappoint. They had a legit happy hour menu which offers tons of rolls and apps on the cheap. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Best sushi burrito ever! The bulgogi was phenomenal and  the sashimi bowl was definitely worth the money. Overall, the value of the food was definitely there. Would recommend to any sushi lover!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Zu (said, \"zoo)! As with many sushi places, if you can make it in for happy hour then you can score some serious deals. My personal favorites are the chicken skewers and spicy edamame. Honestly, the spicy edamame is the best - the sushi is almost a downgrade believe it or not!   But that isn't to say that the sushi is bad. It is just that the spicy edamame is just so good! I've tried Zu's signature and basic rolls. Haven't been disappointed yet. Fiance is a vegetarian and she likes their selection as well.   Staff is very attentive regardless of where you sit. My water glass was refilled every time it got half-way. That is some service! Food came out fast whether it was a app, basic, tempura, or signature. Haven't tried anything off the min menu so I can't comment on it.  Check in on Yelp for some goodies."}
{"text":"Some very excellent gyoza, some of the best and this yakitori was very good as well. I will keep coming back for this, believe that."}
{"text":"If this was just a few miles closer to my house I'd eat here weekly! Everything we've had here has always been amazing!! And their recommendation to come with a group is key! There's so much to try it's hard to resist ordering too much food!   I'm glad they have a sushi menu now, I think when they first opened they didn't. But their rolls are just as good as their sister location, Bei.  And their hot pots are so amazing, but they can feed a crowd!!! Most recently I tried their coconut curry one and it is DIVINE!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always really great here! I come here about twice a week and the food and service is always consistently superb. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chili Garlic Edamame and Shishito peppers some skewers and Bulgigi Hot Pot. What an explosion of flavor. Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great. I particularly like the bar section, where there's 24 hour happy hour and even karaoke every day!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoy this places food. And a bottle of born gold 39 happy hour you cannot beat that. Sami took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"Love this place I have only visited the bar side. Their happy hour is killer! $4 wells and cheap apps!! The bartender that is almost always there is really nice and pretty attentive. Their pot stickers and and seaweed salad are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in Scottsdale while visiting for Spring Training for Oakland A's. Lots of food choices ( Japanese and Korean and even tacos)"}
{"text":"I love the gyoze so much. I ordered bulging I and jjanbbong pot also. Both of them come with rice. I would say it is a good deals. You can order jjanbbong pot and shared by 2 people. Come with happy hrs, you will get good deal. The restaurant has nice environment, a place to chill at night."}
{"text":"First time diner. Definitely will be back. Fresh food and great quality! Ordered the garlic edamame which had the best spice that just dances on your lips and ends up resting on the back of your tongue."}
{"text":"We came here for a family dinner. The service was attentive and thoughtful, drinks were refilled promptly and food was delivered piping hot. We started with the egg rolls. They were some of the best I've had in town. Light, crispy and very flavorful. We also ordered the mixed tempura. The tempura batter was light and the veggies were crisp.   We also enjoyed the gyoza hot pot, and the yaki udon. The udon noodles were thick and fresh, so filling and rich.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Great service and food!! Prices are reasonable if you're a sushi lover. Definitely will come back soon."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food items. Really enjoyed the sushi burrito, hot pot, las Vegas roll, and salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"We came after the lost lake fest as nothing seemed to be open.  Food was good, drinks were cheap, service was excellent.   I ordered the jjambbong hot pot which wasn't spicy at all and the broth was killer. 5/5 I also ordered the spicy pork.  The portions were small but it was tasty. 4/5 Last and least the Green tea mochi ice cream was bleh.  Like 2/5.  The mochi was hard and not squishy at all."}
{"text":"What we had: - Gyoza - Sushi Burrito - Spicy Pork - Chef Omakase Roll - Tuna Carpaccio - Green Tea Mochi  Everything was really good. The best were the spicy pork (so flavorful) & sushi burrito (unique and also full of flavor). The service was great, as well. Very friendly and attentive service.   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So good, i didn't even have a chance to take a picture of my Las Vegas roll. It was my first time, i order take out. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Needed to find a good place to eat that was open late. Our party of 9 was seated about 10pm. We were presently surprised by the menu, the food and the service. Great mix of Japanese and Korean fare. I have traveled to Japan and Korea a lot, and so I have high expectations for this kind of food. They did not disappoint. The sushi, the hot pots, and galbi were all excellent.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"favorite sushi place in tempe! their sushi is super yummy and super affordable! Definitely check out their happy hour, cute outside setting !"}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to dinner places within walking distance. Food and drinks are always pretty good. My only gripe is that happy hour is only at the bar. So if you want to have a comfortable place to sit you have to pay full price on the restaurant side."}
{"text":"Found this place late night on a Tuesday with my boyfriends keen eye after our first choice failed. Never being here before our server recommended the Yaki Udon, omg soooooo good! Definitely recommend this place any time. Good food and good service!!"}
{"text":"Warning : they incentivize Yelp ratings, so their rating could be inflated.   Overall, food was okay, but nothing was what we really expected (or wanted). \"Lollipop sushi\" was not at all sushi, and was probably the weirdest thing I've ever had at a restaurant. Korean fried chicken was a joke, and nothing like Korean fried chicken (it's glorified sesame chicken, like from Panda Express).  But really, it's not even that the food was bad, it was just so bizarre. Wouldn't recommend the place or come back. Also the music is bizarre and unfitting. Felt like I was in a club, not a restaurant.  Quick edit: waitress was very friendly and didn't pressure us to give a good review or anything."}
{"text":"Walked in at 4pm yesterday and two tables were occupied. There was no hostess or server on the floor so my girlfriend and I sat ourselves at the closest booth - at least 10 empty tables and the middle table were completely empty - we thought we'd be helping the hostess by sitting ourselves. The server walked out shortly and aggressively said, \"there's a sign that says wait to be seated!\" We apologized and said there was no hostess and the place was empty and she said \"for the future, you need to wait to be seated\" with a bitchy tone.   We left because who in their right mind says that when the restaurant is empty. If the owner heard a server say this, she would be fired.   When we left, my girlfriend told her that her aggressiveness was pure insanity. A restaurant like this can't afford to act like a dumbass with customers. It's a shame a young, immature, inexperienced server has the audacity to behave that way with the people that keep them open. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and service!  We asked for some speciality rolls and they were happy to meet them for us.  The fresh wasabi  was the icing on the cake.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm from L.A. so the bar for good sushi is set pretty high and this place crushes it. The yellow tail and salmon were better than you can find at most places in LA. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wasabi Hamachi Sashimi was excellent! Shrimp Tempura Roll was very good. Zucchini skewer was tasty. Service was great, and our server gave lots of recommendations. Price was fair. We are definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Really liked the yuki and skewers!! Super yummy! Also service was friendly and it was a great atmosphere to spend Friday dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent community restaurant great food service. The quality of the main course was really good. Rolls and hot pot are great. Stay the F AWAY FROM THE MOCHI. All else was great"}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi...meat was tasty but the veg was bland. Kimchi was mild but still had good flavor"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! Had the sushirito which was amazing. Happy hour prices were spot on!"}
{"text":"Their fried chicken, so so yummy! Lightly dusted with flour gives it a light but very crisp crunch. The flavor is so complex, sweet but a slight touch of spice however it cannot be described as spicy, little garlic profile and sesame flavor. Definitely will order it again!"}
{"text":"First time and loved everything we ordered.  Started with Agedashi Tofu and Ebi Mayo.  Too bad they were out of the Shishito Peppers that night though.   I had the Coconut Chicken Curry Pot and it was perfect.  Others with me had Bulgogi and Fresh Water Eel.     Big menu, great food, reasonable prices....found a new favorite place."}
{"text":"This place is a rare find! The service was timely and everyone was friendly. Great date night atmosphere but still fairly priced. The food is amazing!! It's hard to find fresh sushi in the valley but this place does it! You have to order the garlic chili edamame it's to die for!! The angry caterpillar roll and the eel cucumber roll were both some of the best sushi we've had in a while. would suggest to anyone!!"}
{"text":"My second time here. Great sushi at affordable prices. Happy hour has a variety of choices!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place and I just found it and am SO HAPPY I DID! This place has the best vibe and great prices. Their sushi is amazing and I love this place!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance and the vibe of this restaurant to hang out with friends and family. Today is my first time going and we had 6 people to be seated, but they made us wait when there wasn't a lot of people at the restaurant. We got seated when we had to get their attention. I like the food and the price is okay for it's quality. I think I would come again for small events since it's pretty small area."}
{"text":"The spicy clam hot pot is incredible! Devoured the whole thing! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food: 6/10 Service: 8/10 Bang for your buck: 6/10 Decor: who cares   Came here on a Saturday night. First thing I noticed was the abundance of Korean ads. I knew I have walked into a trap. It's Korean, not Japanese. Decided to check it out anyway, for the chance that it had good Korean food. Decor was not izakaya or Korean, more like contemporary. I didn't mind it. There was one waitress, poor thing was running around by herself on a Saturday night. I can tell they are expecting a big crowd... Looked at the menu, ordered the Korean fried chicken. Portion size was appropriate. Price was around $15 per dish. It was way more saucy than needed. Fried too soft. Flavor was ok. Also had the octopus wth ponzu sauce, which was not great flavor, but seemed somewhat fresh. Got the Alfredo seafood pasta. Very bland, like milk but less flavor. My friend said that's how Korean Alfredo is done in Korea, so I can't blame them; just not to my liking. Overall a 6.5/10. I would not go back again though. There are definitely better Korean food for the money. I suggest they pick either Korean or Japanese and stick to it."}
{"text":"As a Bay Area native, it is so hard to find GOOD sushi in AZ, but this place is as good as it gets to Bay Area sushi and Asian food. Came here with a large group for a bday dinner during their late night happy hour. We had several people waiting on our group who were all patient with group in ordering and making 7 different tabs. It was very much appreciated.  As far as the food, we had ordered an array of different items: Las Vegas roll, philly roll, shrimp roll, bulgogi plate, hot pot, roasted peppers, chicken skewers. Everyone loved their dishes. The sushi was so fresh and had great flavor. I did not try the hot pot but those who got it kept raving about it. One friend who has been to Japan several times had said hot pot was pretty authentic.   Definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Had hot pot and a few entrees.  Food was tasty!  Service was pretty good.  Music on the restaurant side was terrible.  Please fix the music, it was so cheesy and lame."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is pretty legit. We had the California Roll and the Las Vegas Roll. The California Roll came out pretty quick and the LV Roll took quite a bit longer. I was wondering if they forgot about it. But when it came out, it was warm and crispy (probably one of the best I've had). The only thing I had an issue with was the service. I had to flag people down for help. But I would come back.."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Jjambo something hot pot is awesome, plus the service was up there. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and Jojo was great! Highly recommend to all searching for great sushi in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"As a highly rated sushi place in Tempe (okay... maybe that's problem - Tempe), I had high hopes but it turned out to be just okay.   The good:   They have some really interesting sushi rolls.  They use FRESH WASABI on many rolls and I love fresh wasabi.  (I always thought I hated wasabi because I only ever had the paste.  Fresh is so different.)   The bad:  My \"naughty lemonade\" was more on the side of a cheerleader with herpes.  It was alcoholic, sweet and...  yeah, that's pretty much it.   Some of the fish had a bit of an odor to it and didn't taste terribly fresh.    With fresher fish and better sochu cocktails, I think this place could be visit-worthy again.  As it stands, not so much."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Friday night dinner, and luckily it wasn't too crowded. My waitress was very very nice and guided me through the menu. I ordered from the happy hour and the dinner menus. Spicy tuna roll, naughty lemonade, and pork galbi dish were great. My favorite of course was the main dish (grilled meat + rice, can't go wrong). The sake was good, but I thought the 'naughty lemonade' was a cocktail so I couldn't finish my sake alone. The spicy tuna was a little on the salty side, so it tasted better without the soy sauce. The pork was wonderful, I was split between that and the bulgogi. I think I made a great decision either way. I would have loved to try the hot pot too but I was quite full after the items I ordered. I would definitely come back with friends next time I'm in the area! Seems like a great restaurant for larger groups."}
{"text":"This is a authentic Asian late night joint. Always something on the menu to satisfy you. The Mochi is definitely one of the most amazing desserts I have tried. Highhhhhhly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas roll was really good. Plus there service was fats paced and not that long a wait time. A great sushi place."}
{"text":"Amazing place .. Must haves are. Cheese corn, Gyoza, chili garlic edamame & spam katsu"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and everything on the menu has been a hit; along with their music playlist. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant, while it doesn't represent a typical Izakaya, is wonderful. Skewers were very good, maybe could have had a bit more char. The seafood hotpot was delicious with flavorful broth. Great fresh sushi as well. Solid selection of sake and soju too. Great experience, well worth the 10 minute wait to sit down."}
{"text":"Absolutely will come back!  Love the food and karaoke!  Check out their Instagram account for food pix. I can't wait to try everything !"}
{"text":"What a rip off. I was offered a coupon for a free sake with a hot pot. But when I went to leave they charged me and said I had to pay. Apparently the wording on the offer was incorrect. I guess this food establishment does not understand the concept of the customer is always right, instead they defended their position and insisted I pay. I would have gone back as the food was good, but I will not go back now and I would recommend you don't try it as there are other better run and managers sushi places."}
{"text":"I honestly hate writing even somewhat negative reviews but the service and food were so mediocre I felt compelled to. We had to ask twice to even get water, never were asked how the food was until we were pretty much done eating already, had to request to order and to get our check as our server started to walk away from the table... It was all just very reactive, not proactive. I felt like we were almost an annoyance to our server, one of our rolls was the wrong kind/not what we ordered and she didn't apologize or anything, our waters never got refilled. It was even hard to decide what to order because nothing sounded that good or jumped out at me. I just didn't feel that the menu was very cohesive. There were a few pros - the sake selection was great and seemed to be a good value. I also really liked the tempura veggies and would recommend those. Bottom line, I was really excited to try this place because we love B.e.i. (I think these are the same owners) but sadly we were pretty disappointed and won't be back here."}
{"text":"Went here for a really late night dinner and there were only a few tables seated.  The service was...........wonderful....smile.  And so was the food.  Very fresh fish.  We had Chirashi Bowl, Quail Egg Sushi, Koshu Masamune House, Wasabi Hamachi, Yellowtail roll, Sake and tea.  Everything was great.  My only comment was the really dark atmosphere.  I guess it's hip?"}
{"text":"This is a cute sushi spot that satisfied my sushi craving quickly. I ordered the California roll and edamame at happy hour prices- worth it. It comes out fast and tastes really fresh. For dinner I ordered the yaki udon which was a healthy portion of udon noodles with mushrooms, onion and boy choy- I did not add protein but the option is there. I loved it, it was perfect for what I wanted and I personally love mushrooms so yes. My date ordered the gyoza app and the gyoza hot pot for dinner. He loved both. The hot pot, I assume for all of the options listed, are for two people. It's a larger soup pot that comes out boiling hot to eat with rice and it is luscious. I only tried a bit of broth but it was tasty and I'd recommend it if you want some Asian soup. Loved this place and I appreciate the happy hour prices- I'll be going back."}
{"text":"We just came here for the first time tonight! The spicy kimchi hot pot was so delicious, the chili garlic edamame was cooked perfectly and the bulgogi was tender, delicious and filling. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was spot on with some fun music. We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, fast and friendly service, what more could you ask for? My brother brought me here for the first time and I am so happy to find a sushi place close to home!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value! We started with the chef omakase roll and edamame. Wonderful, but the u10 scollop was even better. This may sound weird, but the cheese spam, breaded in Panko and deep fried stole the show! Who'da thunk?!? Thanks to all the staff who stopped frequently to see how we were doing. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always a big fan of asian food, i found this place read a lot of reviews in yelp as i always do. I have ordered spicy garlic tuna, Spicy scallop sushi, spicy salmon roll-all spicy sushi's as i always like. They taste pretty good. Other than that me and my buddy had a signature dish Kkanpungi-Korean style deep fried chicken with sweet spicy marinade taste good."}
{"text":"Friendly service with nice atmosphere for dinner and drinks. It has a wide variety of selections from hot pot, grill, skewer, taco, sushi, etc"}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp and though we would try it out. They have a large selection of items. There is Japanese and Korean food. The place is spacious and open with a good amount of space and seating. Their food is amazing!  There is parking behind the restaurant but I can see it filling up quickly on a busy night.  The service here was great. There staff was fun and made sure we got what we wanted. They even recommended items that were popular or ones that would be good to try out. Our server was awesome!  Their pricing seem to be pretty high. You get to spend quite a bit on one dish. Would put this place in the moderately priced category.  I would recommend trying this place out. While it can be a bit pricy the food and variety is really good."}
{"text":"I usually go here for the hotpot to share with friends and some bulgolgi on the side. This plae is good for late nights as it closes pretty late. We ordered some appetizers, small bites like meatball skewers, agedashi tofu, kalbi, and some other delicious entrees. The atmosphere is pretty comfortable, and a place you would kinda expect from a korean/japanese style late night bar."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and it's a nice ambiance. The food variety is a nice mix between Korean and Japanese. I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Really great meal here! This was my first hot pot experience and I really enjoyed it. We got the coconut curry hot pot and it was delicious! Will come back."}
{"text":"Service was good, atmosphere was quiet,felt like I was in more of a bar setting. The food came out in segments rather than all together for our party. I would go back."}
{"text":"Tofu bowl yum spicy roll are all good jalapeno roll is the bomb, they due a great chicken bowl for the kids too"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town for a reasonable price. Many great options for vegetarian dinners. Great happy hour deals (try the chili garlic edamame and agedashi tofu). Good atmosphere, great for private dining. Not to mention the most amazing mochi dish ever!"}
{"text":"Found this hidden little gem located on Scottsdale road 1 mile south of mcdowell. Their happy hour is the best sushi happy hour around. Elisa is the bartender in the back where the happy hour is... get this, all day and night! Sapporo is 2.95, well drinks are 4, sake bombs are 6.95, and rolls range from 3.95-8.95 in the HH menu. Tvs all around and good music. I date night with my gf here weekly. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Great service! We tried the pork gyoza hotpot and bulgogi were delicious. Complements a cold day! We are looking to come back in the future!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the kitchen staff needs training! My husband's soup (curry) came out in about 15 minutes, but it was another 15 minutes before mine (tamago/unagi bowl) arrived. The rice was undercooked and they brought me another bowl of plain rice, then I had to transfer the food over myself. The eel sauce was so overwhelming, I couldn't distinguish between the egg and the eel. While waiting for my bowl, they tried to serve us other orders four different times! We watched them try several tables before finding the correct table. The hamachi negi roll was rolled so loosely that it could not be picked up by hand nor chopstick without falling completely apart. Sorry, but it's back to Kabuki for us."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great Japanese food including broths and meat skewers. This place is not mainly a sushi place, but it traditional Korean and Japanese dishes. The portions of the dishes are really large so it's a good value because you can split it with many people. The service is very fast."}
{"text":"This place is great! A hidden gem in south scottsdale. We entered through the bar but quickly found our way to the main restaurant where the beer island is located. My hot girlfriend ordered the Banana rice makkoli and loved it. She said it tasted like grown up banana runts. We also ordered the garlic chili edamame and gyzoas which were recommended by our server and they were delicious!! When you come here you have to order those!  Presentation, service, and food were all excellent! We definitely be back"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Asian food on our Friday night date night and this place didn't disappoint. The egg rolls and gyoza were some of the best we have eaten. The Yaki soba noodles with chicken were delicious. ...and all of this was made better by exceptional service. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and nice ambiance. We really liked it! Ordered many appetizers and tangsuyuk. Also late HH is a plus"}
{"text":"We had chili garlic edamame, albacore ceviche, scallop dynamite, and bulgogi mushroom pot. The dishes were creative, fun, and original, but also delicious, and the price was great.   Chili garlic edamame: the regular edamame you would expect, but in a slightly spicy garlig sauce. A little bit salty but may balance the relatively light flavored dishes depending on what else you order.  Albacore ceviche: five stars. The fish was fresh. A lot of onions in the pico de gallo on top which added to the refreshing taste.  Scallop dynamite: seafood and veggies roasted with cheese. Not the typical food you would expect in an Asian resturant, but it was well executed. Surprise in a good way.  Bulgogi mushroom pot: normal hot pot.  Service was great. We dined at the bar. The guy at the bar was very friendly and caring for his customers."}
{"text":"We love this place place!  We really hadn't found good sushi in AZ till we came here.  James is cool and provides great service."}
{"text":"The only reason  I'm giving two stars is because of the tuna carpaccio. It was awesome. The crab cakes were frozen and deep fried....lacking KRAB meat. Yes. Fake crab in the cakes. The hot pot I got was DISGUSTING. Shrimp was foul. Mussels were absolutely awful. The worst though, was the service. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.  Oh yeah. Don't bother going Sunday or Monday, they don't have a bartender."}
{"text":"Omg! The sushi was so amazing. The bartender, Chuey, was so knowledgeable of the menu. He directed us in the best direction. I loved the angry caterpillar. Why so angry? Come by and see."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best sushi in the valley! I enjoy going here every couple days - in addition, it's also great that they offer delivery via DoorDash, for when I don't want to leave the couch. Definitely very tasty, looking forward to visiting again!!!! 10/10"}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly service. The hot pot dishes always are.more that enough. I always have leftovers :3"}
{"text":"So went here on the star rating and was not impressed. Being from San Francisco I have high expectations in sushi. But knowing where I am I wasn't expecting greatness. Well they did not even meet them. The fish was not fresh and was almost hard to eat, the garlic edamame was pretty good. But that's all I could say about this place. The couple I was with and myself felt a little under the weather later that night after dinner. Not saying it was the food but I could of been. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great place to hang out with friend. Many options to choose from the menu."}
{"text":"Ate in the bar for the happy hour all day special! If you \"check in\" for the free edamame, make sure you mention it BEFORE you order and make sure you order the plain edamame. They wont honor it for the chili garlic edamame. I went to pay for my order and i was brought out a plain edamame after I already ate my whole meal so keep that in mind! The only reason for my 4 stars, the process was just handled poorly. Keep that. Chili garlic edamame is bomb though and have never had an issue with the way the food tastes!"}
{"text":"The Vegas roll was incredible and the service was great! Salmon Sashimi is fresh and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing Japanese food. I ordered a good bowl of chicken Thai curry hotpot - super delicious and super sufficing.  Tip: One bowl of hot pot is more than enough for three people."}
{"text":"Great homey atmosphere and welcoming staff! Service was excellent and food was amazing also came out super quick! Great sushi place close to Scottsdale and Tempe!!! Got the Shishito Peppers to start and ended it with the Jalepeno Vegas Roll alongside a Spicy Tuna.... perfection!"}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend and was told it was happy hour all day if we went to their separate adjacent bar. We decided to try it out and were definitely pleased with the food selection and cheap drinks. We ordered $5 gyoza, $6 sushi, and shared a bulgogi hot pot. I liked the gyoza and sushi but was not so excited about the hot pot. I've had hot pot and made a version myself and loved it.  The liquid had an odd taste to me and I wish the restaurant had Korean sauces to offer because it was bland. Also, there was only one employee serving the whole bar so service was friendly but slow. That said, I'd come back and order other things and look forward to it."}
{"text":"Great place with some great food. First timer and I was not disappointed at all. The sushi was good, I was surprised with how well it tasted. Mozzarella sticks were great as well. I ordered the bulgogi mushroom pot and it was delicious. It is a large portion of soup, I recommend one soup for two people. Definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"Sake is incredible. Udon noodles with chicken was delightful with sweet soy.  Must have Saki to enjoy. Love the music."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is one of the best Asian bar in Scottsdale. The food is delicious and the environment is very great."}
{"text":"Love this place not only for the food, but the service is better than 90% of the Scottsdale area. Jojo and the other servers are proffesional and personal at the same time. The happy hour prices are fantastic and the selectuon is great. Try the Poke bowl and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight and wasn't disappointed. I was so excited to eat that I forgot to take pictures!! We tried the Vegas Roll, chicken skewer, pork skewer, meatball skewer, crab cakes, and salmon kama. The salmon kama was the best!!! Very flavorful and cooked just right. The skewers were good but had the same sauce on them. The pork and chicken had the same flavor because of this. The crab cakes were average and the vegas roll was standard but still good. I would recommend this place as their menu has a wide variety of options. I'm looking forward to come here again and try a hot pot!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a California roll and a cheap beer.  I only go during happy hour because the Cali roll is on sale and the draft Sapporo is $2.50.  A hard combo to beat and hasn't been matched anywhere else.  They often offer yelp check-in coupons and so I've gotten free Edamame a couple of times.  The spicy garlic edamame is TO DIE FOR.  They are not stingy with the garlic and the spice gives an otherwise sort of bland item a real kick."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.. and the  restaurant was very noisy. We came in around 11pm after our flight was canceled and service was very slow due to having only one server for the entire restaurant. The ladies room water was not working that day so i had to use the male bathroom and that was very weird."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great service, the atmosphere was nice. We had the spicy Korean chicken and vegetable Tempura...Both were excellent! I would highly recommend this place...a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi restaurant with great staff. They also have other options if you are not a fan of sushi itself. This is my favorite place to go! I highly recommend the Las Vegas roll."}
{"text":"I'm an Out of town business traveler  and decided to try a different Sushi place from my norms. Just ordered a pair of Rainbow Rolls but was pleasantly surprised. Food was great and service was top notch."}
{"text":"Seemed like the bartender didn't like her job that much?  Didn't really attempt to make a connection! Just kinda stood there. I work in the service industry and bartended and served and i would never treat my bar guest like she did. By no means was she mean or rude, she just seemed like she didn't want to there, very short, she didnt say how we were/ what we were up too? We are young? She could of made a great connection and got a better tip? Maybe some more training on costumer service skills"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp for best sushi burrito. The claim is very true. I ordered the sushi burrito. It was delicious and cheap because of happy hour. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great service and good food that can be a pretty good deal if you know order properly.  Came here because it was close to the airport and we had a flight in a few hours. BF and I both ordered a hotpot with rice and noodle, he got the oden and I got the spicy crab. In hindsight we could have just gotten one oden and shared because it came with so many carbs already. I also got a salmon nigiri was average in price and quality. The food in general was average, very satisfying but nothing amazing. I always like restaurants that give a lot of different options and this place is one of them. I feel like these are the best places to go with a big group because I tend to like to eat the same thing over and over again but the people I hang out with will get tired of the things I like.  If it was for just the food, I'd probably only give it 3/4 stars, but the service was exceptional. Our waitress was really really nice and helpful the entire time. We asked her if we could drink a bottle of champagne in the restaurant because we didn't want to  bring it on our flight and check a bag. We didn't really expect her to say yes but she did, she also went and got us chilled glasses without us even asking.   Gratuity is included but we ended up each giving her a dollar or so more because she really deserved it. The place is open late because its a bar so I would definitely visit it next time I have a late flight going out or in."}
{"text":"Eel grill is delicious? I plan to eat ramen soup but no ramen soup here. So I order yaki udon ."}
{"text":"Amazing dish!!! Left me in ecstasy! char grill chicken is a flavor extravaganza!! The server and service was on point. Fast and efficient!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed each time I've been here.   There is a private lot with a good amount of parking. The location itself has plenty of Seating and is welcoming to couples or larger groups.   The service has always been prompt and friendly. I've never had to wait for a beverage or a plate. If and when things are running a little slow, they are quick to disclose and let you know (in this instance we got there right at 4 and the sushi chef wasn't in, but it didn't matter as we got our dish quickly anyways-- I appreciated them letting me know).   They have a FAB HH and everything had been fresh and well seasoned. I was hesitant to order to the sushi burrito, but my friend April S had it before and made sure we got it.  It wAs a giant roll in rice paper full of delish raw tuna and salmon amount other flavors that provided a great contrast of both flavors and textures.   They offer good drink specials as well. I had a few drafts and them tried the pineapple sujo... It was delish!   Try this place out before going to a chain restaurant. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Is good restaurant. The special roll is delicious. The restaurant is quie. It is good place for dating."}
{"text":"All of the staff is super friendly and the sushi is amazing! All very fresh. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The sushi is always amazing and happy hour is good..  Love to come here and eat quality sushi Everytime"}
{"text":"Good service in this restaurant. I enjoyed the seafood hot pot. The broth is pretty flavorful and I enjoyed the lofty amount of seafood that they provide to you. We were able to request steamed gyozas as well which were also pretty delicious. Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"We got poke bowl, Las Vegas rolls, and Alaska roll. Poke bowl is so good. The sauce is very testy. Service is the great."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place! Sushi was fresh and service was great. There was a little bug flying around, but that was the only negative."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location! The staff is nice and the happy host is great. It's walking distance to my house so the $7 sake bombs are where it's at! Come check em out! The egg rolls are awesome, and the sushi is good too! Come check em out!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, my girlfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place. It is a fantastic blend Korean and Japanese cuisine. The food is great, we have LITERALLY had everything on the menu, so I say this with confidence   The atmosphere is different based on the day, they have a great music playlist that differs based on the day. We love going Thursday's because there's plenty of throwback HipHop, which allows us to eat a vibe out at the same time.  We love our sever Jolene, she is so cool and down to earth and definitely adds to our experience. P.S...she knows all the good mixes for the \"Soju\" drinks lol  Our favorite things on the menu are Bulgogi, Coconut chicken curry Hot-pots, meatball skewers, pork & chicken Tang Soo Yuk And also the Scallop Dynamite."}
{"text":"I loved everything about our visit here! The vibes were great, the staff was friendly and VERY accommodating! We ordered two rolls from the happy hour menu, the coconut chicken curry hot pot, and one signature dish. My goodness!! The best Japanese/Korean food I have had in a long time! I'm not even a big curry kind of person but this was to die for! The best part is they are down the street from me! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fresh and delicious!!! Great happy hour with even better food. Friendly service and fun atmosphere. The Las Vegas roll is an absolute must and Kern is super cool."}
{"text":"I lived in Himeji, Japan for over two years and it was nice to see an izakaya come into the Greater Phoenix area let alone Scottsdale. The appetizers I ordered were very good ;the tempura was excellent and my main dish was delicious as well. I think I will come during happy hour since the sake is 50% off then.Also got to meet the owners ( husband inside the restaurant and wife waiting for people to arrive outside the restaurant.)I will visit there again and bring some people with me."}
{"text":"This turned out to be a great last minute decision! The beer specials for happy hour are great, especially if you like Saporro. On draft for 2.95 daily from 4-7pm. The sushi was delicious and very fresh. The service is fast and friendly and the staff is polite. The environment is clean with some upbeat music. Perfect for a low lit date night."}
{"text":"We tried Zu Izakaya while visiting from the San Francisco Bay area. We didn't read any reviews and barely read the menu before choosing it, and I was so pleased! The maguro nigiri was tasty and well made. The tofu kimchi specialty was super tasty; note the dish's description if you don't eat meat: it has pork (mmmm pork!). And I got to try banana nigori sake; I'm usually a sucker for banana-flavored food and drink, and this was a treat! Service was very capable and attentive, though it was mostly empty on a Tuesday night so I can't really say how it might be when busy. 4 stars plus a strong desire to eat there again and give it 5."}
{"text":"Incredible ambiance and very friendly staff. The food was delicious and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Asian spot! Very cool interior.  Clean!  Yummy delicious treats  I got the garlic spicy tuna roll. Jon got a pineapple soju. And we had a bunch of happy hour appetizers from 9-11pm."}
{"text":"A really great, non-sushi Japanese place. I've had the veggie skewers and several of the soups and they are all fantastic.  You can make a meal for two or three out of a single hot pot. I think they have the best seaweed salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food-so good Service- so efficient and pleasant and informative  Music- right up my alley Atmosphere- homie  We will probably come back tomorrow  Got the Spicy Hot Pot btw"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Nice place to hangout with friends. Great atmosphere. Open late so if you have no where to good. It's a good place to check it out."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of this particular location because it used to house a delight restaurant called Lo Cascio.  We dined at Lo Cascio for decades. Therefore, we were excited to sample the offerings of the restaurant that had taken its place. Would it be just as good, or would it be just passable.  The verdict is still out, and it will most likely require a return visit.  We came here on a Friday Night, and the place was nearly packed. The decor has certainly been updated to modern standards, and looked quite inviting and elegant. It definitely departed from the conventional layout that the former occupants.  We wanted to give this place an honest try on our first visit, so we ordered a sampling of various dishes that would provide us the breadth of their offerings.   For starters, we ordered the California & Cucumber Sushi Roll.s This is a typical standard fare that is offered by many restaurants, and should provide us with a good introduction.  Unfortunately, I am not sure what happened this evening, but the rolls were very dry. They were so dry that it left a definitive sandy texture in our mouths.   Next up was the Gyoza. We have had this in many ways, and prefer the steamed version. However, the fried version works just as well. Except in this particular instance, it was completely overdone. The wrapper was burned on the edges, and to top it all off; the meat in the interior didn't cook all the way through. Therefore, it tasted under cooked.  After the initial fails, the rest of our meals were quite palatable. The Udon was juicy and delicately spiced. Just the perfect temperature for a cold evening, such as we were having this particular evening.  The Chicken Skewer and the Korean Spicy Sweet and Sour Chicken provided delightfully distinct flavors for the main repast. The Chicken Skewers were lathered in an amazing semi-sweet sauce that just enlivened our palates.  Along with the prompt and attentive service, our overall experience was good - but it wasn't great. The opening salvo of fails was disheartening, but in the end; it proved to be an adequate dining experience.  We will have to give this place another try, at a different time to see how consistent they are in their meal preparation and presentation."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has a nice chill vibe that you really look far in Koran bar. So like I recommend if you just wanna chill this place is the perfect place to like just chill?"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place... Can't go wrong with your order, it's all delicious. Go sushi!"}
{"text":"Rly good food. Highly recommend. Excellent service. Rly good happy hour deals everyday from 4-7pm and 9-11pm."}
{"text":"Zu Izakaya's a gem in Scottsdale! They serve delicious Japanese/Korean food at a reasonable price. I ordered the gyoza appetizer, poke bowl, tonkatsu, and sushi burrito. All four dishes were flavorful and filling. The service was quick and attentive as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place, small, low key, and great food and service!  They have a great menu, (not just sushi rolls), although they are great, you never have to wait for a table, and a better than average sake list."}
{"text":"Responded quickly to our Yelp RSVP, it was a quiet night, but we had great service and delish food!"}
{"text":"Dayae was awesome! She provided great service and made sure all our needs were met. The sushi was the freshest i've had in tempe hands down! I highly suggest eating here, make sure to get dayae as your server."}
{"text":"Great environment friendly staff the perfect sushi place!! We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"The Bulgogi beef dynamite roll was very tasty, will be coming back to try more of their sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Various flavors of sake that we fully enjoyed. The quiet atmosphere was very nice vs the loud and raucous atmosphere we do often find in many restaurants. In fact, we enjoyed the experience so much, we went back a second time in the 10 days we were in the area. I highly recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu was definitely an assortment of different cuisines from all over Asia, but with an emphasis on Japanese. Tried nearly all the small dishes and and was pleasantly surprised. The mushroom hot pot was really good as well. A good place to go for Asia inspired dishes. Nice ambience, and good spot to meet with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials and some of the best tempura I've ever had! We only had sushi but I saw the ramen and it looked fantastic."}
{"text":"They have the best Las Vegas roll and the vibe is very mellow. They also have fast and friendly service. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Service was great and the food was awesome. The happy hour menu wasn't to shabby, either."}
{"text":"Take out tonight was tasty, portions were great, take out container totally sucked. Cheap hinged Styrofoam box leaked and not nice to eat from. Bar is detached from dining room but service was tall and great. I will dine in next time for sure."}
{"text":"this place is so cool and perfect for girls meeting. Food here is tasty and many choices. I recommend here!"}
{"text":"great, fast service. Our food came extremely quick. Being a vegetarian, I have limited options to on what to order. Our server, Kern, was amazing, gave me suggestions, and was attentive at all times. I would have given it 5 stars, but music is a bit too loud, and the restaurant is a bit cold. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Food was really great, ordered the Yaki udon with chicken and it was perfect! Leah was incredibly helpful with our questions. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been passing by this place for a while, and have always wondered about it! I went in today with my friend and I was so happy I did! The service was prompt, and the atmosphere was cute! The food was good, which is great because I have been looking for a new Asian restaurant to go too! A great find!"}
{"text":"Went here for my three year anniversary in October. Ordered sake bombs, flavored sake, crab cakes, cheese spam katsu, black mussel hot pot with udon noodles, and some sushi rolls. Everything was awesome! The hot pot was amazing. Big enough for two people or leftovers. Would be really great if you're sick and they deliver through doordash or Postmates. Can't remember which, they had a sign. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best place to get sushi in the Tempe/Phoenix area! It combines great food with affordable prices and very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I recommend anything tempura or fried, and their skewers. Basically, most things you order here will be delicious."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new sushi happy hour spot since moving from the East Valley area... We definitely were not disappointed! We arrived for the dinner time happy hour, and ordered gyoza, a couple beers, spicy tuna roll, and the jalapeño/spicy Las Vegas roll. I was really happy with all! The gyoza is fresh and tasty! And sushi tasted fresh and delicious. The spicy tuna roll could have been a little spicier but that's why we got Sriracha and wasabi. We Weill definitely be coming back for more sushi and to try out some of their entree which looked amazing! Can't wait to try the Hotpot especially :)"}
{"text":"I went whit my Daughter Firs Time the food we order was Delicious The service and the place very nice, We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi spot. Nice happy hour and specials for Yelp and Instagram review. Must try is their jalapeno Vegas roll"}
{"text":"Food is a 9 service is a zero. I would order and pick up but I've been to this restaurant twice now and each time the service is awful. This time we were there for two hours and didn't get all of our food, we ended up just telling them to cancel it because it took so long. Our server didn't even know what we had our hadn't gotten. The staff is nice and the food is good but that doesn't make up for extremely poor service."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. I'm new to the seafood liking, but they had some great stuff. A seafood soup that I had for the first time (YUM) and of course, fresh tuna rolls were bomb. They had a wide selection of sake too."}
{"text":"This place is a mixture between Korean and Japanese foods. Only try Korean dishes today and they were all delicious. Great service and decent prices. Will come back next time to try their sushis"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled across this joint while heading back to our hotel.  I have to say, after a long day out in the heat, the miso soup was refreshing.  The sashimi was superb as well as the sriracha shrimp roll. Usually I like to dunk my sushi in soy sauce and ginger, but I didn't need to here.  The waitress was nice and patient with us while we figured out our order.  Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Food: Japanese/Korean fusion. We tried the tuna tacos, bulgogi tacos, crab cakes, Agedashi tofu, chicken skewers, and gyoza.  The chicken skewers were reminiscent of Japan'd Izakayas--very tasty and smokey. The crab cakes are similar to Japanese croquette--also very good.  The tacos were pretty basic...the shells were straight from a box.  The agedashi tofu was also pretty average. I would recommend cooks to go easy with the salt. Overall, there aren't very many places like this in Phoenix so I give it 3 stars.  This is a cheaper version of Sumomaya.   Ambiance/Service: Excellent and modern presentation. Open late night and reverse happy hour has some good deals. The service was prompt and friendly.   Overall impression: The food is definitely aimed at the American palate. Really cool atmosphere though. I would go back to try the hot pots."}
{"text":"This place is very cozy and has good tofu kimchi soup... It's not on the menu but u should add the soft tofu to the kimchi soup. The portion is pretty big too and can fill 2 people."}
{"text":"Zu Izakaya is a very cool place-lots of variety for food and a nice atmosphere. It was easy to make a reservation and the egg rolls were delicious. Everyone was super friendly, as well."}
{"text":"Elisa is the best bartender east of Japan. West too.   Oh and the food is amazing.  Their happy hour prices are stupendous."}
{"text":"My three kids tried sushi for the first time. This was the place to do it. I could enjoy my spicy tuna while they enjoyed the Las Vegas roll."}
{"text":"First time visiting Zu Izakaya had an amazing experience. The service was great, food were amazing and tasty! The ambient was very nice. Overall I would recommend to come eat and have a sake."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant with my husband since it opened. We have tried many dishes and you absolutely cannot go wrong with any!  The food here is amazing and the service is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Went here last month for my birthday, soooooo yummy! The set up of the restaurant with the bar and the actual restaurant was a little confusing but it wasn't that big of a deal. And we only spent about $80 for 4 people and we got A LOT of food"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to check out! Prices aren't bad, and the food was actually amazing."}
{"text":"This place gives good food , nice place to talk . Awesome price! James as our server did a great job! We love it."}
{"text":"Tuna poke bowl!!! Delicious. I will definitely come back for it.  Skewers are delicious late night snacks.  Waitress was super nice and friendly. She kindly accommodated my change in order in the last minute."}
{"text":"This place has great food! The customer service provided by Jojo was out of this world. We will definitely be going again"}
{"text":"Yaki Udon WOW! could eat this every day.  Must try if you're in Scottsdale. Kimchi hot pot is also legit."}
{"text":"I ordered the kkanpungi, shishito peppers, Philly roll, chiCken wings, and the rolled egg. Food was good. The drinks are value. Would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, me and my boyfriend try to come in a few times a month. The service is fantastic (Ask for JoJo) , the food is delicious and the happy hour is great! My favorites are the sausage, chicken, meatball and quail egg skewers are incredible and the Spicy Soft Tofu Hot Pot comforts the soul. If you haven't tried this place you need to get your life together. lol"}
{"text":"This place has great sushi and galbi. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Its a must try."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chirashi i have ever eaten. Had skewers of garlic, chicken, pork, sausage, chicken wings, and meatballs. each was awesome. Also tried the grilled eel and mochi. Easy to find, no problem parking in lot on a saturday night, great and quick service. Coming back soon for hot pots, more  sashimi and to sample the appetizers."}
{"text":"Great food ordered a few things and shared ordered chicken beef and a hot pot and gyoza"}
{"text":"Oh wow! The chicken skewers are the bomb! Everything else is simple, original and has great flavor for price. A great start up new restaurant, I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and sushi is on point! Butter corn is awesome too. Love the service here. If you are looking for great Korean/Japanese food this is definitely the spot! :)"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting for a conference and came here for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. The atmosphere is great, a big communal table in the center of the space with a big screen for games. We got the scallop and mushroom yakatori, so good. The poke bowl was so good, and then I got the oden hot pot - so so so good. The best fishcake soup I've had in time. They have soju too! The service is great, food is awesome. Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, beautiful waitress!  I had eel for the first time here and it was amazing"}
{"text":"This is my first time stepping away from my regular sushi joint and this one was amazing. Kevin our bartender, was the best! He makes a great margarita as well! The sushi on the same hit was just as tasteful and delicious! 10/10 would recommend! This just became my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing. Every time we come, we get enough food to fill the table - a little bit of everything! I especially love the garlic chili edamame - I could eat a bowl of it! Our server James was great!"}
{"text":"Came in late last night to order takeout grilled chicken with veggies and rice. It smelled amazing in the car ride home, and being very excited to eat it, I expected a lot. When I had my first bite, I became thoroughly disappointed. The quality of the chicken reminded me no more than strip mall quality japanese or possibly airport food. The price was much too high for the quality I received, paying 11 dollars when it should have been 6. I sadly won't be going back."}
{"text":"After a long drive to Phoenix we were starving and looking for some good food.. Yelp to the rescue. We shared the hot pot (a must have) soo good. Great place friendly staff and good drink specials!"}
{"text":"The place is a gem. I was a bit reluctant to order sushi but when it tried it.. it was fresh.. I also ordered Thai curry chicken pot... refreshingly good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner.   Sat at the bar w Alecia the bar tender.   She did a great job suggesting food items.   I had some chicken skewers and California rolls.   They honored the yelp free appetizer offer.  It was very good.    Great little place."}
{"text":"Service is slow and terrible I think.  The reviews are stellar but that wasn't what we saw.  The skewer items were good and expect smaller portion, the sashimi was good not great, and getting a drink was tough.  20-30 minutes.  Glad we tried it but won't go back."}
{"text":"Great location and food! Waitresses are nice.    You get some free dishes if you review online."}
{"text":"This is the secoond time we came here because they have great food and excellent service at a reasonable price and we are certainly going to come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious authenti Asian food! Their curry is a must have! Their sushi variety is amazing, and their noodles compliment the dish really good!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Very cool vibe. Our sushi roll was good, but nothing special. My poke bowl was not great. My friend didnt finish his Korean chicken. I tasted it and it wasn't the rave that our server claimed."}
{"text":"My belly is so HAPPY right now! Food is delicious! Speedy service! Everyone is extremely friendly. Second time coming here and will come again and again!"}
{"text":"We really like the udon Alfredo. Normally don't like pasta Alfredo but this felt more cleansing. The agedashi tofu was good too. Definitely ordering that again."}
{"text":"First time in, found this place while looking for something else.  The menu was sort of sushi  + yakitori + izakaya + Korean.  Very wide range of food.  We started with a couple of skewers, shrimp, chicken, and scallops the first two were fine,  except for the scallops,  more on that later. . . Then we had a couple of sushi rolls, spider crab and spicy tuna with toasted garlic.  The later being a new favorite for me.   We finished with a couple of hotpots, mussels and spicy mixed seafood.  Also one of our party had a HUGE yellowtail collar.  All were very good and we finished all we could hold.    Back to the scallops, if you cook, you know that some shellfish is sold by the units/lb.  U-16/20 shrimp are 16 to 20 shrimp per pound or a little less than an ounce per shrimp.  Zu advertises and had on the menu \"U-10\" Scallops.  That's 1.6 oz. per scallop, just the right size to sear.  We expected 2 orders of BIG scallops, roasted yakitori style.   We got scallops, they were maybe U-16s or less.  Tiny, about 3/4 of an inch in diameter.  So don't order the scallops and you should be OK.  I suggest the manager either get some dry U-10s to grill, or take the \"U-10\" reference off the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent Service & Amazing salmon sashimi! First time trying this wonderful restaurant & fall in love . Great menu on sushi rolls & also serve Korean BBQ beef . Def coming back and try their specialty."}
{"text":"Wow, great environment for relaxing after a long day. The food was fast and awesome and the service was great! Definitely a nice place to wind down and share a couple drinks with good company. Definitely coming back to try more of their signature dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and everything is so great!! We have ordered seafood hot pot and the ramen is really good. Gyoza is my fav!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. I had the Las Vegas roll and chicken wings and both were very delicious. They also have a really good happy hour too. Every day from 4 to 7 . Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"great food! hot pot was delicious and service was great. very diverse menu in terms of covering main asian dishes. will definitely return. and it's open late!"}
{"text":"This is most certainly my new favorite happy hour sushi spot. I can only speak for the vegetarian rolls, but the avocado rolls were better than I expected. The hot sake and miso is very tasty as well. I would recommend this place over any other happy hour sushi place in Phoenix. Especially with their very generous yelp coupons. You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"If you have ever had good sushi, you will be disappointed here. I genuinely do not understand how this place has such a high rating. We tried it based on its yelp rating. It was not good. We ordered an appetizer. It came after our main course and only after we asked twice about it. The fish in the sushi roles was all mashed which was obviously to hide how little fish you actually get in the rolls. The rolls were remarkably bland (probably due to the minimal fish). The beer selection has only one local beer. The wait staff were inattentive for how few patrons were around."}
{"text":"Alisa was our server, she was amazing! Sat in the bar area, good call. Love the TVs and casual atmosphere. Sake was delicious, sushi was fresh! They have very fast service. Overall I was totally impressed. I will totally be back"}
{"text":"Great food and definitely something different than all the other places around me. It's a must try for sure and everything is tasty ;-)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  First time here but the music, ambiance and service were great.  Oh the food?  Awesome!  Presentation, quality and uniqueness made us eat way more than we should have.  Chili garlic Edamame and Cheese spam Katsu to start.  Quail egg sashimi was my challenge tonight by my husband...I took the challenge and it was great.  We had the eel sashimi, and a couple house specialties like the jalapeno Vegas roll...bomb dot com!  Definitely a keeper, we will be back again.  By the way, lots of wonderful sakes and sojus to choose from. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best place for Japanese hot pot in Scottsdale ! Try the fishcake hot pot, you will be amazed"}
{"text":"We decided to stop into Zu Izakaya since we are regulars at Bei their other sister restaurant down the street. We came in on a Friday night and every table had people except the long community table in the center of the restaurant so we were seated there. We wanted to sit on the bar side but it was closed as I'm thinking they had some water/plumbing issue from the looks outside. Not a huge biggie though. I ordered the Coconut Chicken Curry Hot Pot and my boyfriend ordered a roll. The Hot Pot is definitely big enough to share as we even had leftovers. It was flavored well and my boyfriend enjoyed his roll as well. Service was ok but not great.   Not sure if we will be back since we LOVE Bei so much but so glad we tried Zu Izakaya."}
{"text":"It's hard to describe how amazing this place is, when I ate the sushi rolls I felt like I was walking on water like in the Biblical times! I really thought the chef was the second coming! I can say that I found an outstanding place! And the staff are angels!"}
{"text":"Foods were great espacilly shisimi. We love an atmosphere here. Server was kind of slow but he was very nice and talktive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night, the happy hour prices are phenomenal and the sushi is delicious! We were very impressed by both the service and quality of food (especially for the price)! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The edamame was surprisingly hot and al foods were hot fresh from the kitchen. Tofu spicy soup with mussels was delicious. Sushi's were well made. Mushroom skewers were so so. Crab cake was too greasy for me."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this new restaurant (rare in phx) which means a bar where you can have a bite to eat with your drink. It's perfect for the lite dinner or to start your post-work week Friday night with shishito peppers and skewers of well-prepared meats! The only recommendation for the cook is to use a little less salt in some of the food! Also I think the green tea should come included in your experience (reg. 2.95)  The Owner of BEI created this place and was very friendly as were the other staff! Try this place out with a date or with some friends to have hotpot!"}
{"text":"I really like the skewers: shrimp and sausage are especially good. The waitress is very nice and the location is also a plus."}
{"text":"Great food, very sweet servers. We ordered two dishes and they are fabulous. We came to this after work, they open super late, worked out perfectly for us"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is on point.  Had the deep fried shrimp which came out great. And the beef belbogi came out amazing just boneless which was great. I recommend the asparagus"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the atmosphere was good very welcoming, customer service is excellent! We ordered food in the happy hour menu, our favorite was the pork skewers, crab cake and las vegas roll. They also have a clean bathroom which I think is a must on every restaurants!"}
{"text":"Chili garlic edamame and sushi were both great. James is a very attentive waiter as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Relatively solid food. Service was nice and their chicken teriyaki was decent.  They also had some interesting menu items that I would like to explore in the near future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a date night! Love the sushi and the amazing service they have! All the servers are always happy to help!"}
{"text":"I liked the service. And the good was great. We are trying the Mochi for first time. Noodles was good too."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite go to restaurant in Tempe. This spicy chili garlic edamame on the happy hour menu is really good. Manager wasn't helpful when it came to customizing a sushi roll but the waiter was really kind in recommending another dish. Overall good service, clean place, great music."}
{"text":"Moved in like right across the street, sushi is always delicious, service is great, sometimes super packed but always worth it!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Asian restaurant close to my house and found this place. What a hidden gem, it looked like a good place from the outside and it didn't disappoint. Very classy looking on the inside, the service was fantastic and the food was great! James helped us and was a perfect host. He answered all of our questions and we never had to wait. The spring rolls were the best I ever had, can't wait to go back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always wonder why it's not crowded when I come here.  The food and drinks are reasonably priced (especially during Happy Hour).  The atmosphere and service are good.  So far I've tried about 25% of their dishes.  Some of the most interesting dishes are their appetizers.  I've been eating a lot of their hot pots on these cold nights.  No dish I really hated.  The food has been pretty consistent, but I normally go on the same days."}
{"text":"Went to this place and ended up being delcious! Fast service and I recommend trying the jalapeño Vegas roll!! Definitely will come back !"}
{"text":"Place is great. Good atmosphere good food what more can you ask for. Open late for that late night smack after a show."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour! Their prices is so affordable especially for happy hour for sushi! Their sushi is pretty fresh for the price and their appetizers is amazing. Oh and their soups is good too!"}
{"text":"Open late at night. Usually till 1 a.m. except on Sundays. Random selection of music. Lots of seating and extended bar area in the back.  Big and easy access parking lot outside.  Location is random.   We ordered the Jjambbong hot pot and Las Vegas roll. Add additional edamame with checking in on Instagram.  With regards to the hot pot, price is around 16.95 and it comes with a side of rice and Raman in the hot pot. Ramen noodle is not that much, but the rice makes up for it. The Hot Pot also included some mushroom, shrimp, scallops, black mussels, clams, vegetables, pork. Soup broth tastes like shin Ramen with maybe some miso. Not spicy at all. You will get thirsty from the sodium. Decent amount of clams and mussels. Serving is probably for 1 person. But i did share the dish and still was full. They do have a variety of other hot pot styles. Probably better to come here on a cold winter day. Pricing is usually around $15 for the other hot pots.   With regards to the Las Vegas roll, they have happy hour at 4 to 7 p.m. and every day at 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. everyday. Edamame will cost around 2.5 dollars. Edamame was fresh and steam and hot and not cold. right amount of salt. Essentially, basic good edamame.  Las Vegas roll during happy hours around 6.95. Pretty decent with the Las Vegas roll definitely more cream cheese in the roll. Would order again during happy hour.  Environment is pretty clean. Server is friendly and attentive.   More to explore on the menu, as they have tacos, skewers, and other signature dishes. They also serve char-grill meets in a bowl of rice. Korean Style.  With regards to the Mochi ice cream?which was obtain after Yelp review. Not too sweet. Just the way I like it. But could use more mochi covering."}
{"text":"Yum! This place rocks! One of my favorite places in the Scottsdale area.  Everything here is super delicious. You will not be disappointed. Some of my favorite things are   Curry chicken soup pot is dreamy - so so good  Kimchi excellent  Gyoza is fresh and flavorful Bulgogi Grill is great if you like that type of Korean beef...you can't stop eating Galbi beef is also quite addicting  Prices are fair. Quality of food outstanding.  Staff is great.  Plenty of parking all around."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Wreck-x-N-Effect - Rump Shaker)  All I wanna try is Zu Zu Zu Zu And a poom-poom - Zu Izakaya  Check-In baby, check-in baby one two three four Check-In baby, check-in baby one two three  Check-In baby, check-in baby one two  Check-In baby, check-in baby one  It's called Izakaya, the place is like a gastropub I'm feeling hungry and your tapas coming in yummy Try out your food from Scottsdale down by your North Tempe Yelping you around contemplate before I enter   I've been wanting to try this place for some times and finally!  I hate having to keep pushing off a restaurant and hearing it from other people!  The place itself is unique with a large patio area and a community bar in the middle of the restaurant.    After a visit to Japan and going to some Izakaya bars there I was stoked to try one here in PHX!  So to start we ordered the shishito peppers, meatballs, and chicken skewers.  All their skewers are drizzled with yakatori sauce.  The shishito peppers had an extra sprinkle of cayenne peppers giving it some kick.  The meatballs and chicken I thought could be grilled a little longer since it's that extra char that brings out the flavors.  We also order some Yellowtail Nigiri and the Tuna Carpaccio.  Definitely had better Yellowtail and elsewhere and fresher, but it does the job.  The Tuna Carpaccio was subtle and was laying on a bed of ponzu like sauce.  The Jalapeno atop was the kicker and the tuna was melted in your mouth; best bite of the night I would say!  In the end, Zu Izakaya has a great happy hour menu and price point.  The place is easy going and the community table and patio is definitely an allure.  Though I rather would have a traditional Izakaya bar where it's dink, tiny, and full of smoke from the grill; this place will have to do for now! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant-bar with the perfect atmosphere to drink up izakaya-style with your buddies. Highly recommend the skewers, squid salad and rolls. Soak it up with their multiple selections of Korean hot pots and wash it down with Orion beer (from Okinawa)."}
{"text":"Great happy hour options everyday of the week! The unom noodle bowl was my boyfriend's favorite. The Spicy Tuna Roll was good, but I would have liked more of a crunch on the roll. Overall, the service & the food was great!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Izakaya's before. The food is not bad. Just kind of pricey in my opinion. It's supposed to be where you get off work, order a few things and drink. But these items are quite expensive and it becomes more than a full cost of a meal.  The meat kabob was like a hamburger meat. One small round piece. I was expecting steak meat. Or at least something bigger.  The poke rice bowl looked appetizing however. Will have to try next time if not on a budget."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the coconut curry is great it has such a great flavor I definitely recommend it, also let's talk about this atmosphere it truly makes you feel like your in a authentic asian restaurant they have booth and table so comfy seating YAS MS KING KONG"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere. I really enjoy the hot pot with bulgogi/mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Kent was a great server. Sushi was reasonably priced. Definitely will be coming back. This is my new go to Sushi place!"}
{"text":"Been driving by quite a few time and wanting to try since moving here from Vegas. This place is definitely on par with the other Ozakaya place that I've been to. Everything was excellent so was the service.  If you are a fan of Izakaya,  then this place is a must try ."}
{"text":"This sushi has turned us into regulars! Good food, awesome prices during happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good. No wait when we came on a Sunday night. Ok atmosphere. Has a bar section and restaurant section. The food came pretty fast but our appatizer came after we were half way done with our meal. We had the jalapeno Vegas roll which was pretty good, along with the veggie tempura, spicy salmon, and philly roll! Green tea mochi ice cream sucked."}
{"text":"We love coming to Zu. The food has been fantastic each time. My boyfriend and I ordered the seafood pot the first time and sushi the second time around. They have a great selection of beer and sake to order from as well. The staff is very friendly and we loved our server Semi! Its definitely our new go-to place."}
{"text":"Great service great food! I had the bulgogi which was surprisingly small but it was definitely good. I also had the sushiritto of which was a surprisingly excellent snack."}
{"text":"Every time we go here the food and service are amazing! Chirashi bowl and Yaki Udon are the best! Get a sake bomb on happy hour (4pm-7pm & 9pm-11pm)"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Some good happy hour specials as well; don't miss those. We were amazed by the quality of food, and for a good price. Menu has a nice variety of food options.  There's a small bar in the back as well. Separate entrance. Try it out."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Perfect late night spot for delicious food and laid back atmosphere. Tried probably half the menu and didn't come across one thing I didn't like.   Definitely try the Shiobiani steak, the bulgogi, and go for the quail eggs if you're feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant many times and we decided to stop for dinner. So glad we did!  Food is fantastic... all of it and we ordered many things.  The Tang Soo Yuk was perfect along with unagi bowl, eel and Vagas sushi rolls. Even their edamame is well prepared. Oh and the fried tofu in broth was good.  Then on top of that, our server was so friendly and on top of getting is what we needed.  Will be back again for more :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant,prompt service , and the food is delicious. They have really good rolls , especially the siracha shrimp roll."}
{"text":"Super friendly waitstaff. Amazing appetizers and traditional sushi for reasonable happy hour prices! Every recommendation that the waitress gave us was awesome. Will definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Short walk from my house and I love how they have happy hour every day from 4-7. If I could recommend one thing it would be the chili garlic edamame. I have to go whenever I start craving it. I have yet to go to karaoke at night but I've heard it's supposed to be fun"}
{"text":"I came here with my team for happy hour on my birthday and it was great! We enjoyed almost everything we ordered, specifically the grilled zucchini and curry hot pot. The sushi was also nice and fresh. I like that they have an extensive menu for both happy hour and entree options, plus it's close by! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Happy hour 4-7 every day with food included. The jalapeño Vegas roll was by far our favorite and was even included in the happy hour so it was well worth the price. The tofu appetizer was another favorite. The service was really fast and our server was friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations and provided quality service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the east coast and had dinner here. Excellent Japanese/Korean Asian food.  All the hot pots are huge and can feed at two adults. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Happy Hour as there several items to choose from for both dining and imbibing. Staff was  super and the place was spacious but felt cozy."}
{"text":"I would say this is one and only Japanese style bar in Tempe (as far as I know) and food wise-everything is delicious but if you looked at their menu, it could be a lil' bit confusing because most of the dishes are Japanese-American cusines so you might need longer time deciding what you're gonna want. I order Alfredo udon every time, along with meatball skewers. They have Japanese beers like Asahi, Orion and Sapporo, which I prefer more than American beers. The food is not too salty or strong so even if you don't drink, the dishes could serve as a great meal. Sammy is our server every time we dine in and she's amazing! Perfect for night outs and late night gatherings."}
{"text":"Quick service. Delicious food. Convenient location. What's more to love? Boyfriend said they were the best Vegas rolls he's ever had. The bulgogi was better than the Korean restaurant! Very good and will definitely be bringing some friends back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and generous food portion and do come during happy hours ... for their happy hours menu ..."}
{"text":"This has been our go to restaurant for 2 years! Amazing hot pots, sushi, sake bombs and service! You always get a wholesome experience! It's a plus that it's always happy hour!"}
{"text":"First time here since they opened. Went to the back bar which is pretty cool because it's separated from the restaurant and I can be obnoxious without disturbing diners. Ordered 6 items and all of the food was awesome. It was Daniels first day behind the bar and he was super nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very progressive menu. Calming and comforting ambiance with great sound system. As the menu says, great place to stop in for a drink and a skewer!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great selection on sushi rolls as well as hot pot options. Very casual and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"we tried the las vegas roll, jalapeño vegas roll, the beef dish and free edamame and mochi that we got for free from yelp. The sushi and main dish came out super quick and it was to die for. I will definitely be coming back. See you next time!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food, noodles, hot pot, sushi etc. We've tried different items each time we've been here and they have all been good. Nice neighborhood spot and great happy hour! Love the garlic edamame and garlic sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friends.  We wanted to try the hot pot.  The place is nice, clean, and modern decor feel to it.  Service was good but a tad slow.  Ordered and inhaled:  1.  Agedashi Tofu - It was pretty good, could have a crispier outside 2.  Chicken & Neobiani Steak Skewer - Both skewers were good 3.  Pork Gyoza Pot - Japanese tonkotsu soup base pot with pork gyoza, egg, clear noodle, and assorted vegetable - I think it would have been been if I traded for udon noodles.  I love udon."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. The food is great. They have two separate places to eat, the bar and the dining room. The bar is fun and offers karaoke. The dining room is well designed. I like that they're open until 2am as well."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great food for non-fish eaters! Would recommend! This is a great spot to eat food and sit down."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely jaw dropping. I walked in and one of those huge dragon things that was in the casino opening of rush hour came right at me. If this ain't the spirit of Japan by god nothing is. Although my server had a look on his face like someone was shining a bright light on his face, he saw me as soon as I hit the door."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and great service! Been here a few times and it never disappoints... our favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale by far."}
{"text":"Looks really good in here. Place is clean and nicely done. We're from Las Vegas and spoiled with great restaurants. This is up to par with out great restaurants. Looking forward to great early dinner and here for Happy Hour.   After eating  Food was great and will for sure come back when in town again."}
{"text":"Our favorite local place!  I love the chicken curry hot pot, my husband always gets the poke bowl and it is his favorite in town!  My only complaint is that I wish they had more ramen dishes on their menu.  The staff is always friendly here and accommodating.  Love the happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food here was great! I got the Kkanpungi. The sweet and spicy flavors were balanced well. The staff was friendly and visited the table often."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in a long time! Absolutely loved the vegas roll and My gf ordered the coconut chicken curry. I usually don't like curry but it was delicious! Would definitely recommend to a friend and come back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Service was fantastic and servers were very attentive and made sure to explain the menu to us after finding out it was our first time here. Food portions are rather big so I would suggest sharing when dining with a group or on a date. Definitely would repeat."}
{"text":"came into PHX from a late flight.  Hotel suggested this place, a little hesitant since we will be in Korea and Japan in the upcoming weeks.  So glad that we did.  love the ambience, the choices of food was also great.  coming from a big city like Chicago we were very surprised how good everything was, from the service, food quality and awesome  happy hour choices.  Definitely a place to go to."}
{"text":"Great quick service. Sushi was great! Ordered the spicy salmon and tuna rolls as well as the bulgogi tacos. Highly recommend 8/10."}
{"text":"A Great Asia restaurant in Phoenix. We were come 11:30pm for dinner, the Chicken wing is beautiful, my son said it is better than KFC. The Udon noodle just right taste like perfect Korea udon. It is surprise have nice Korea food in Arizona.Love it, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I did not enjoy this place. The service and atmosphere were fine but the food was expensive and honestly not very good!   We ordered a few of the steak kabobs and crab cakes to start off with. First of all, the kabobs are not kabobs at all-- it was literally a hamburger patty with teriyaki sauce on top. The crab cakes were mostly fried batter which I guess is understandable since they were cheap.  I got the udon noodle bowl. The server told me it was white meat chicken and the very few pieces of chicken I did have were dark meat. Unlike the description it did not have veggies, only tons and tons of onions and noodles. My boyfriend got some kind of spicy chicken dish. The chicken was fried dark meat and came with a side of white rice. The entrees were about $15 each.  This place is located so close to me that I was hoping it would be good. We won't be coming back. Definitely a place to pass on! There are plenty of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We needed a good place to eat after picking some friends from the airport. Our criteria was Open late and drinks. This place fit the bill. Our waiter Jay was awesome. We got seated quickly, they had good selection of drinks and awesome appetizers. We tried the bulgogi tacos and wings. They had all kinds of meat skewers which were awesome with beer. Plus they had a separate karaoke bar in the back after your done eating to go and hang out. Karaoke was free and lots of fun. Good place to come if your are near the airport!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome get the pork and tuna tacos. Hot pots are great especially the clams. They have great food and happy hour."}
{"text":"Very close to home! Great vibes! Love the eagerness of the servers! Chili garlic edamame is delicious! Must have! Definitely Recommend."}
{"text":"The decorations are great, good is fabulous, staff is very friendly and I would definitely come back and recommend to others! So yummy!"}
{"text":"What can I say besides that I have been only a handful of times. However, every single time I have visited this place, it has been an enjoying experience. Food is great. Ambience is great. Customer service was good too. All in all, definitely in my staple of places to go occasionally."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We ordered the Chicken wings (8 pieces) and the hot pot. They were very good and I'll recommend both of them. I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three separate times on both the restaurant and bar side. The bar side definitely has a bar vibe, but the food is equally amazing on both. We usually come during happy hour (every day 4-7pm and 9-11pm) which makes everything so worth it. We always order a bunch of the appetizers and I've loved them all especially the buttered corn, salmon Kama, and chili garlic edamame. I would definitely recommend for any group, couple, or family. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great sushi menu and sushi tasted fresh. Really liked the Jalapeno Vegas roll. The udon soup was excellent. We added noodles which I'd recommend.  Definitely try this place out! Prices are decent."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the ambience is very nice! It's a nice classy date night spot for great sushi."}
{"text":"Zu Izakaya is a bit of a mixed bag.  The food quality is good.  The service is great.  The atmosphere has a young, upscale-ish flare with a vibe you'd find in Asia. But FOREWARNING: their portion sizes were falsely advertised and made me wish I had ordered something different.  In my honest opinion, false advertising goes a long way in overall customer satisfaction, irregardless of the service and quality of food.  I ordered the Poke Bowl with salmon, and on the taste front, it delivered all around.  It offers a wide variety of ingredients and flavors (in addition to the rice and the salmon) as picture below.  BUT, if you look at Zu Izakaya's business-uploaded picture of the salmon Poke Bowl on the menu and website (you can even find it here on Yelp!)...it looks like there's a TON of salmon in the bowl.  Either those are some really large salmon chunks, or half that bowl is covered in salmon (oh, photography can really work wonders). And compare that to how this dish actually plays out in my picture below.  I was dumbfounded at how little salmon I actually got. I saw the pictures on the menu and thought, \"damn, that's a lot of salmon and rice!  That's exactly what I need today.  This is great!\" only to be disappointed in person.  If they stripped EVERYTHING off that bowl and just left half rice and half salmon and charged me double the price, I would've been much happier than what I receive here.  The service though was great.  Two of my friends at the table had a flight to catch later that night and didn't want to check a bag just for a bottle of champagne they were planning to take with them (engagements for the win!), so our server VERY generously allowed us to open the bottle of champagne at our table for no charge.  She even provided cups for us to use.  Great customer service goes a long way and will likely be the factor for my return.  My rating is probably harsh and as you can tell, I'm extremely bitter about getting less fish than advertised, even though the food quality was great.  But there's something...uneasy about businesses that have to manipulate their business photos to get a result that does not reflect reality.  Fortunately, it is not a direct reflection of the restaurant itself which is everything but.  When I return to AZ again next year, I'll update my review accordingly once I've tried other menu offerings and have more of an \"objective\" experience."}
{"text":"We are new to the area, so I may have a different expectation for sushi than what Arizona can offer, but we were very disappointed with our order.  We had the eel and salmon nigiri (which weren't bad), the spicy salmon roll, the rainbow roll, and the caterpillar roll.  They looked appetizing, but the flavor was missing.  Everything just tasted bland and lifeless.  The staff were very friendly and the service was quick, but not worth the effort in my opinion.  That being said, we did not try any of the Korean bbq or main meals, so that may be worth a try based on the other reviews I read."}
{"text":"Cool little spot with neat decor. Ordered chicken skewers, edamame, jalapeno and the regular Las Vegas roll, and the spicy seafood miso hot pot. Loved the chicken skewers, super tasty. Las Vegas roll was oddly sweet which I was just not a fan of. The hot pot was highly regarded and sounded really good but unfortunately it was super salty, even for me and I like salty things, to the point where I could only eat just a little and it was not spicy one bit which was really disappointing. Not sure I'd be willing to come back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"A great spot to drink after work. The food options are small to pair with your drink of choice (try the sake). The skewers are very tasty and reasonably priced. The back bar has multiple televisions for the sports people out there too. I definitely recommend this place and will be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and the food is great! I recommend the squid salad, and sushi. The service here is great, and so are the prices. I definitely will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Tried the the hot pot. Was pretty good. Would definitely recommend this place. Environment is cool and has god food for the price!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Staff is wonderful. I ordered the garlic spicy tuna roll, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.    I will be honest.  I remember when this was an Italian Buffet style place (never tried it) so I was always put off by the building I guess.   I had a friend suggest a girls dinner here and so glad she did!! Here is a run down of what we had and like:  We started with the Ahi Tacos and Chicken tacos - They come in two so this was perfect for the 4 of us each getting one small taco. Both were delicious- I did prefer the tuna over the chicken.   We also shared 2 orders of the Gyoza - perfectly crispy and a great dipping sauce - cant go wrong here  Happy Hour here is great!!   Now on to the GLORY of meals!  HOT POT HEAVEN!!  These bowls are HUGE and we each got our own (too much food).  I would share between two people or be ready for left overs.  I ordered the Spicy Kimchi Pot with no pork but tofu and mushrooms! So good - perfect spice level and great compliment with the kimchi.  My friend ordered the Jjambbong Pot - if you like seafood this is a must!!! It is packed with different seafood and the flavor is out of this world good ( waitress recommended this pot as well).  We ended up mixing both of our broths and made Hot Pot Magic. You're Welcome.  If you have seen this place while driving down Scottsdale next time stop in and try it out!! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Large menu selection to cater to your taste buds. Happy hour everyday! Quick, fast, Kind and friendly service. We got the garlic spicy tuna roll and it tasted so fresh and amazing! We also got hotspot and it was perfect for the cold and rainy day. All in all we had a wonderful experience here."}
{"text":"Best Sushi EVER. We go to this place all the time and they never let us down. Their happy hour from 9-11pm has great deals too!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was good for a selection of various rolls and apps.  Sushi was fresh and reasonably priced.  No sushi bar to sit at. Only tables and booths  Service attentive yet not overly friendly."}
{"text":"We would recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food was delicious, staff was friendly, place is super clean, and the price is reasonable. Overall, we had the best dining experience with Zu Izakaya."}
{"text":"Awesome and fast service, yummy food! We got the edamame, togarashi roll, and sushi burrito! All good!  I also liked the ambiance of the place. Very chill and music was also relaxing. Will definitely come back and try happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but it's not really worth your money for the quality.  You can find much better food for much cheaper.  The service was..let's say a bit slow(in the head).  If you're in the area and you're hungry, it's definitely not a bad place to eat.  You won't really remember this place if you eat here though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing every time we come! Chill atmosphere with great music!  The staff is friendly and the service is always excellent!  It's open late and have an amazing happy hr selection!  Get the sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had in my life. Made a request for no spicy mayo or mayo of any kind so they just canceled those sushi orders.  We ended up sitting at this place for over an hour and a half. Awful just awful"}
{"text":"Hot pots are amazing! Staff is great... Especially Kevin. He's my favorite and always so funny. This has definitely become my go to place for delicious food and a perfect atmosphere...not to mention the best happy hour and Kevin!"}
{"text":"Stop by Phoenix for dinner on the way back to Tucson, my wife glad that we make a right choice. Food delicious and good service."}
{"text":"Wow the Ebi Mayo is FANTASTIC!!!! We also had mirin mackerel which was great. And they have these skewers... Pretty much everything was good we also had these steak skewers that resembled hamburger patties lol but to say the least they were absolutely DELICIOUS !!! I will def be coming back here again"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple of times before and it is usually not bad. This time we visited a little earlier than usual (5/6 pm) and it was pretty busy. We were asked if we would like to sit in the restaurant area or go to the bar area ( a separate room that you have to walk out and around the corner to) and enjoy happy hour pricing. We agreed to sit at the bar and were told to head outside and go in the bar. When we walked in, there was literally one seat available and there were two of us. We ended up sitting outside, which wasn't bad because the weather was unusually nice. We sat around for at least 10-15 min and had no one come out to take our order so I thought we might have to order from the bar. As I walked in to ask, the very flustered bar tender said she'd be right out. She was and we ordered drinks and food and everything was fine after that. They should really have some kind of system in place to let the front of the house know when there is no longer anymore room in the car to seat people, as well as arrange for more help in the bar area as well, as it seemed to be pretty busy, while the restaurant area was dead and their servers were practically hanging out in there.. other than that, food and drinks are great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, service was great. The music was a bit too loud as evidenced by the rattling overhead speaker. But - don't let that deter you, the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty rad, the food is good, the drink specials are bomb and our bartender (Chuey) was great. I had come here a few times before and I wasn't super into it but with the re-open and new bar staff it's great."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour, they have very few options for happy hour. Sushi and the rolls taste good, service is good. Good place to hangout with friends. They have range of alcoholic drinks, we didn't try them though. The crab cakes are made of imitation meat so vegetarians can try them, but they are fried unlike the real ones."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Bartender was awesome! It was walking distance from my hotel. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Very interesting and pretty delicious food. The sushi was okay, but all our grill dishes were delicious. I personally had chicken skewers, an Alaska roll, and gyoza. My favorite was the skewers. Tender, grilled, and flavorful. Again the sushi was ok and the gyoza was over fried. We also had some slow service and the restraunt was so hot inside. Mind you we went at dinner time on a Friday night, but it wasn't very busy so better service was expected (aka more than one server)."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out. Ordered the bulgogi along with edamame and veggie spring rolls. Food was definitely a 10/10. We came late so no sushi (only up to 11pm) so I will for sure come back for the sushi burritos. Overall awesome place so far."}
{"text":"Interesting Korean/Japanese fusion concept in the Tempe area. Although their Yelp rating is very high, they do offer complimentary appetizers/desserts to incentivize reviews. The 3 star rating is because of their small portions and high prices. Service was normal, but the main entrees took slightly longer than usual. Here are some of the dishes that we ordered: - Edamame: warm & nicely seasoned (comes w/ Yelp check in) - Gyoza: thin skin, very hot when it came out, pretty juicy (comes w/ Yelp review) - Chicken Skewer: not much fat, slightly seasoned  - Galbi: very tasty & good quality but a small portion - Fresh Water Eel: too mushy, would've liked it to be more crispy; some small & sharp bones were found in a few of the pieces - Chicken Curry Hot Pot: was mildly spicy, a little bit too salty, most of the chicken was at the bottom; large portion of Curry soup"}
{"text":"The happy hour is great, the sushi is fresh, and the service is excellent. What more could you want? I will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"The perfect place if you're looking for a good combination between sushi bar and Asian fushion food options. The Las Vegas roll was delicious! My boyfriend had the kkangpougi and he loved it. They had a good happy hour menu and I enjoyed the Yuki white peach sake. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this Asian Fusion place. Small restaurant with a separate bar area. The place was nicely furnished and clean. The server (Semi) was very sweet and attentive. They have a great Happy Hour with several food selections/appetizers that we made to most of. There main menu is priced ok, somewhat higher than other places I've dined at, but I'm not holding that against them. We had Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza, Cheese & Spam Katsu, Panko Crab Cakes, Salmon Cheek Kalma, Ebi (Shrimp) Honey Mayo, Neoniani Steak Skewer & Meatball Skewer and for the main course, we shared a beef short rib galbi. Everything was well seasoned and had distinctive flavors.  Definitely would go back for more good food.  Give this place a try...Great evening with an old grade school friend."}
{"text":"A great place to come and hang out with friends, eat great food, and relax. Great prices for the portions, clean environment, and tasty dishes. The staff is welcoming and on top of the service."}
{"text":"Dish 1: Kimchi Taco and Tuna Taco -I would prefer the taco was soft taco not hard  -Kimchi taste burned. I did not like the Kimchi taco but Tuna taco was good. Also, it was pretty cheap! Would like to re-order with Tuna next time.  Dish 2: Korean BBQ Bulgogi  -Nothing really special but the price is cheap and smaller portion.  Dish 3: Seafood Alfredo Udon -This was my favorite. The Udon noodle was chewy and I love Alfredo so... I would like to re-order. :D  Dish 4: Tang Soo Yuk -This is my least favorite when I compare with other Tang Soo Yuk. I tasted strong pepper. I do not really taste Tang Soo Yuk from this dish. Taste more something fusion. It does not taste bad it taste different. If you are looking fore real Tang Soo Yuk, I would not suggest."}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was prompt and courteous, restaurant was clean good ambiance. Could use some other non alcohol options beside Pepsi products,  best gyoza ive had will def come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh and delicious food!  My favorites were the spicy tuna rolls and the mackerel.  We came to this restaurant and celebrated my daughter's birthday.  Had a large party of people and as a result had a large selection of food.  Everything was great!  Not one complaint.  Service was top notch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered two seafood hot spots, and grilled fresh water eel. The food are average. I wish they put more flavor in the hot pot. The eel is good. Overall it's a good experience. But I think I can find other similar place with cheaper price."}
{"text":"excellent customer service. food was good. waitress was polite and accommodating. gave me extra enoki and free chopsticks. happy hour deals were excellent. great place to go for a late night meal."}
{"text":"We call this place the \"zoo\" cause I have no idea how to pronounce the name. They have delicious food here!! The prices are great and they have a wonderful happy hour menu as well. The first time we came we got the garlic edamame, best I've ever had! It is soooo good! We get it everytime now. Service is always good and it is hit or miss on how busy they are. I love that on valentine's day every couple got a glowing rose from the owner. Very sweet and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Well, this place has worst short rib and ramen. The short rib was so tough you cant barely chew it. The ramen aren't actually ramen more likely cup noodle ramen, that you can get it from any Asian grocery."}
{"text":"We're always on the hunt for new great Asian food in the area. Zu hit the spot for sure! We got the shishito peppers to start--they were in a sauce that was simple, and very tasty. For entres we got the beef bulgogi and Kkanpungi (Korean-style fried chicken with sweet-spicy marinade). The beef bulgogi came out on a sizzling plate which made us even more excited for it. The beef was very tender and flavorful and the veggies were really good with it too. The Kkanpungi was something I had never had before, but can't wait to have it again. The chicken stayed tender and moist on the inside while it stayed crunchy on the outside. The sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. They also have really good rice--I've been to so many Asian restaurants where the entree is great, but they skimp on the rice so I appreciated the really good bowl of rice from here. We saw a waiter walking by with a hot pot--it looked more like a cauldron(it was so big). We're looking forward to trying a hot pot next.  We told our waiter that it was our first time here and she brought us out a green tea mochi ice cream for dessert, just to say thanks for being a first time customer. It's the little things like that that just make me love a place even more."}
{"text":"Okay this place is stellar. Had the Bulgogi Mushroom hot pot. Tons of flavor and meat.   Ordered the Alaska anD Spicy Tuna rolls.  Very good and filling.  Very upbeat feel to the place.  2nd time eating here this week   Sometimes it's hard to find a place that's open late near PHX but this place is open until 2am.    Solid 5 for us."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and ordered kimchi hot pot, grilled pork and mixed tempura. Hot pot is huge and serves two no problem. Tempura is nice and crispy and comes in a huge plate. Definitely will be making a trip back."}
{"text":"Made an online order and it was one of the easiest things I've done lol even more simple than callin it in, so it's super cool that they offer this option! The veggie tempura was really good; fairly close to actual Japanese tempura so that was a nice surprise to me. The spicy salmon and tuna hand roll were average; pretty good but nothing AMAZING. One thing I hated was the to-go spy sauce they give. I've been here to dine in and the soy sauce was good but the carry out soy sauce kind of ruined the sushi for me.  I still like it for it's late hours and quick service and will be returning. The soy sauce is just a minor point ;)"}
{"text":"This place is garbage . Meatballs are frozen package type. Rolls were barely edible . Wouldn't even let my dog eat this."}
{"text":"Ambiance is amazing. Provides any type of crowd needed. Food is great and a nice selection of beers. Love their concept of a restaurant one side and a karaoke bar on the other. Also in a great location to uber. Just love it for both just a quick dinner or a night out. A must check out place."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great happy hour specials! Kkanpunggi chicken & green tea ice cream are delicious."}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent food and service especially on a Sunday night. Great atmosphere with excellent music. The Soju Bomb was the bomb! Excellent grilled salmon. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Kkanpungi, a Korean style fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce is so delicious. The batter is perfect, not too thick - light enough to taste the crunchy of the batter and also the juiciness of the chicken. We usually ordered pick up and then put the cheese on top when we had it at home."}
{"text":"Hells yes!!!!! Food was so fresh and delicious! Service was amazing! Recipes were fun and delicious. Please go here and enjoy the ^@&# our of yourselves!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really delicious and unique. Really like the ambience here. Large collections of alcoholic beverages as well. Really good service as well and our orders came pretty quick. Do come early though as the tables were packed pass 7pm. Really enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for a nice dinner. The atmosphere is very nice and quaint. The wait staff were very kind and attentive.   We ordered the gyoza, udon noodles, Las Vegas roll, and shrimp tempura roll. All of our food came out fairly quickly. The rolls were excellent and the gyoza was amazing. I would definitely recommend.   The udon wasn't my favorite, but I feel like it was a poor ordering choice on my part, and that others would like it.   Overall, great experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good for happy hour.  They have happy hour 7 days a week and we ended up getting 2 saki bombs, 3 different skewers (all amazing), edamame, and egg rolls (also amazing) totaling $30.  It's got parking, and is low key so wasn't too busy when we went.  All the food came out at different times, but was perfect for happy hour and was so quick.  Overall, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food and happy hour are delicious! Open late, crab cakes, garlic edamame, chicken and MEATBALL skewers, and the BEST skillet grilled butter corn with mozzarella cheese Kevin was great, excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Worth going for the shihito peppers. Lots of Tapas plates to try during happy hour. We nailed a lot of them during our happy hour visits. The place was an Italian place, is now owned by the guys who run Bai down the road. The entrance to the bar is in teh back, which is wierd until you get used to it, but we had good service and enjoyed the plates The grilled meats on appetizer were so good we had them twice. Happy hour is a good time to try everything because prices are cut quite a bit. Wings are made with Korean hot sauce pasye but are kind of neat."}
{"text":"James took care of me and my friend really well. The food quality was very good too.. definitely a recommended place for late night snacks. Will come back again"}
{"text":"I love that this place is opened late as it is near impossible to get anything other than mexican food and fast food after 10pm in AZ. I ordered their ramen dish. The broth wasn't bad but the ramen noodle were the kind that came from actual top ramen. If they upgraded to better noodles it would taste better! The ramens do come in huge portions tho! I also hear the kalbi meat is good but never tried. They have a separate dining area for the bar, this area has all the happy hour menu. Thy also have a karaoke machine on the bar side. The food only side looks cuter tho! I would try it again, especially when I want asian food late at night!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! Very good and flavorful food and quick service ! Would recommend this to anyone who likes Asian food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself and we all liked or meals. waitress was GREAT. she was new and charming. I forgot her name. I have to give only 4* because their oden was not up to par. there were no veggies. no konbu no egg no tofu no konyaku no daikon nothing except one potato. there was only fishcake varieties. the other dishes were good except this."}
{"text":"Introduced to this place by my foodie  friends and it is awesome.  recommend the squid legs (seasoned and fried to perfextion, hot pot (broth is delicious), pork regular and spicy are both wonderful...my friends did all the ordering so they knew what to get but I'd be willing to try anything since everything I did try was great."}
{"text":"James was a great server and the happy hour was fantastic! I loved every bite and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting Zu and we were happy with the good service. The menu had a lot of variety with both Korean and Japanese dishes. The hot pot tofu soup was a bit watered down but overall everything was delicious. We got all of our dishes fairly quickly too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The bulgogi is to die for and the sushi rolls are delicious. Recommend to anyone looking to eat at an Asian restaurant that has a little bit of everything to offer."}
{"text":"We found this place randomly and decided to stop in. Super good quality chicken and flavorful sides. The sushi isn't super high quality fish and there's not a ton of roll options but it is very good!"}
{"text":"The Jjanbbong is amazing. I'm consistently surprised by this place. Great service, good atmosphere, and even better food. Venture away from the sushi and try the hot pots. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"When the gf and I came in, we found that the place had great music and a very nice comforting environment. I decided to order 4 rolls and a Sapporo. Total was under $30 for 2. Price was perfect for eally great food. Fresh quality and served hot. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Korean hotpot I've ever taste! I highly recommend the traditional Korean pot one and the beef pot one! Try them! you will like them!"}
{"text":"You can't beat their everyday happy hour. Decent priced sushi, apps, and drinks. I've had the gyoza, chili garlic edamame, and sushi burrito, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice service. Recommend highly. Especially on Sundays."}
{"text":"Actually really impressed with this place. Prices were above average but the food was excellent. I had the unagi tamago bowl and loved it. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The only reason they have high reviews is because they give free food- gyoza or mochi. I lived in Japan, this place is not Japanese food. Even if it was good but over priced I would be happy. But it is both tasteless and expensive."}
{"text":"Gyoza was delicious. Favorite thing we had was the guachajong salmon - perfect spice level and not heavy at all.  Plays too much emotional, breakup songs over the stereo system. Buzz kill."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Authentic food. Cool music. Awesome atmosphere! Get the jala Vegas roll! The eel sauce is super good too! I had a pretty great experience. This is a good place to go for all ages. You can come for family dinner and a dates!"}
{"text":"the back bar has happy hour always, and that means a round of sake unfiltered and sushI is like 16 before tip. And they deserve the tip! Idk how they do it but I love sake sea weed salad and sushi and good alcohol so props to them for doing it  and doing it cheap.  Favorite"}
{"text":"Great experience. Delicious food. Best sushi I've had. Our server (James) was very attentive and prompt. Definitely coming back next week again."}
{"text":"Jumping on the bandwagon here.  The interior is a little minimalist and could use a little spicing up.  But....food is outstanding.  We got the calamari and garlic edamame as apps.  Edamame was very good.  Calamari came in big strips like chicken strips but was meaty and the breading wasn't too overwhelming.  Great sauce with it too!  Our entrees were a seafood hot pot and the ahi poke salad.  Both great flavors and very fresh. The hotpot was jammed full of yummy seafood.  Prices reasonable too.  Service perfect.  I'll be going back to try other things.  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! It was great to find a izakaya place out in Arizona. Didn't think I would find somewhere to eat good Japanese out here in the southwest. The scallop roll was really good. Enjoyed the pork and beef meatball skewer. The gyoza were deep fried, which is usually not my favorite but they were pretty darn good. The spam and cheese katsu was amazing! The butter corn was not exactly my style, but I'm glad I tried it. Ambience of the place felt like I was in Japan. Very modern and kinda hip. Would visit again"}
{"text":"Cool looking spot...  Menu looks great. We had one of the spicy hot pots. It was packed with mussels, clams and pork. Flavor was on point!  Our server Tereaz was  knowledgable and gave us great service!  Will defiantly go back and try some of the Korean dishes!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here at Zu. I got here at around 5:00PM, for the Happy Hour menu. The sushi rolls were excellent. ordered Las Vegas Roll, Shrimp and Philly Roll. I'll be back!   PS - Great music!"}
{"text":"This bar/food kitchen was wonderful. Excellent service  Excellent food!!!!Would go Back again.   Sushi was very fresh an yummy.  Loved the Lollipops."}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight, and I have to say it was worth it. Staff was pleasant and adorable, very quick to respond even with the business inside already. The food was well prepared and presented not to mention well priced for the portions. My only complaint is they made me do this review for free ice cream that I would've gladly paid for. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Very good service! Servers first day and he did an awesome job explaining menu and helping with selections. First time trying Korean dish - spicy pork grill was very generous portions. Hot pot was a new and equally delightful experience, we skipped the sushi since we do sushi almost weekly. Nice place, good good and service, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food! Nice and clean along with cool music. Chef really knows how to make sushi. We loved the hip atmosphere and attention by wait staff."}
{"text":"Perfect for Friday night hang out and their happy hours from 9-11 P.M is awesome . As for food , We ordered skewers, egg rolls and chicken hot pot. They tasted so good especially the hot pot and portion is huge. Well worth the money . Will definitely come next time ."}
{"text":"Night-time hunger kicked in for hubby. He was craving sushi and we both wanted to get out of our crappy hotel room. Luckily, this place has a happy hour at 9p and it was just down the street!   I enjoyed the avocado Roll (not on the hh menu, but still a decent price) and the chicken skewers. I also got a free order of egg rolls after tagging them in an Instagram post. But our favorite of the evening was definitely the Las Vegas Roll because it was deep fried. Major win.   The only disappointment was the sushi burrito. It's just better to get one at at a place that specializes in them and let's you load them up with all the awesome stuff you want.   Service was fine. We would definitely hit this place up next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food here is great, love the atmosphere and I have never had a bad experience. The happy hour is the best :) Kern is my favorite waiter! He's funny and is very attentive. Also they option til one so great for late night munchies."}
{"text":"It's a quick and easy place to grab some food! It's all delicious! We had the spicy pork which had the perfect spice to sweet chicken ratio. And we also had the Udon Noodles which was noodleiocous . But all in all it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Great little place with options for vegetarians. We had the butter corn which was delicious. The green green roll was amazing. The ambiance and service was very very very good. Perfect for a low key date night."}
{"text":"Such a convenient location for me. The ambiance is nice, too. I ordered the chicken with veggies and rice. It was sizzling hot and delicious. Even the water was good, didn't taste like tap water and came with lemon. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. We did have to wait a bit for someone to greet us. It was slower so understandable. Our waitress frequently stopped by to check on us and waters always filled.   Food was mediocre. We ordered chicken, pork, and steak skewers. The sauce tasted the same for all so it was disappointing. I was hoping for more variety. We also ordered Korean fried chicken. It was drenched in sauce and blah. We ate less than half and decided not to take it home. Our waitress was nice and asked us if we didn't enjoy it. She managed to get us a discount. Good effort on service once again.   Ambiance is nice and modern. Unfortunately, food wasn't as exciting as other yelpers made it to be.  Sad face!!"}
{"text":"Food was on point! Came for happy hour - highly recommend the chicken skewers. They are a good portion for the price. Jalapeno Vegas Roll was huge and spicy! James was a rockstar"}
{"text":"Zu Izakaya offers a nice variety of Japanese, Korean, and fusion dishes in small bites or main entrees. We came here right before happy hour ended at 7 which allowed us to indulge in some discounted dishes such as the poke bowl, sushi burrito, agedashi tofu and chicken skewers. We also ordered a few selections from the main menu. This included small bites like asparagus, quail egg, cheese Spam katsu, and meatball skewers. The only larger meal we ordered (Aside from the happy hour poke bowl) was the freshwater eel.  My favorites were the poke and eel. The poke was very fresh, with a deep rich red color, and a good amount of seasoning. The bowl came with rice, nori strips, seaweed, and crab salad. The eel was a beautiful presentation with tender eel, sweet sauce, and vegetables on the bottom. A more unique dish was the \"sushi burrito\" which was basically a modified roll with ingredients like spicy tuna, tamago and crab salad, wrapped in soy paper and cut into 2 like you would cut a burrito in half.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the cheese Spam katsu. The gooey melted cheese was similar to Velveeta and it was way too salty combined with the Spam. I did like the crispy crunch of the breading, but maybe some sweet sauce or a different cheese with the katsu would balance out the flavors more.  When we were seated and ready to order my server took down my friends' orders and then walked away. We had to exclaim to her loudly \"Wait come back\" for her to actually take my order down. There seemed to be a miscommunication about the amount of food we wanted to order but instead of apologizing she had an attitude about it, like it wasn't her fault she decided to leave a customer hanging without taking down their order. Service was better as the meal continued though and drinks were refilled and plates taken away as needed.  Service could use an attitude adjustment, but I'll be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"They have really good sushi and very friendly service. I've been there a few times and have never been disappointed! I recommend the jalapeño Vegas roll"}
{"text":"I went to Zu for the first time a week after it opened and I'm so happy I found this gem! First of all, I've traveled throughout Asia and the interior of the restaurant is so modern and reminded me of the Izakaya restaurants from my travels. They have a unique variety of Asian wines/drinks, and they also have a full bar of all the normal stuff. Next, their menu. I love that it is so unique and it has food on there you can't get anywhere else in the valley. Kimchi and bulgogi tacos? Yes please! Their skewers and hot pots are also yummy (I've been back a few times - haha). Anyways, I highly recommend. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour dig. Love the back bar. Logan is an awesome bartender.  Saki saki saki bombs!   We usually go to Geisha for local sushi but We'll definitely be back for more.   We've also done takeout here and he food is always good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Been here several times. They get sushi, rice bowl, noodles, skewers and open late. we always get the quail egg skewers, I personally really like the jjambbong pot, it taste like the one I had when I visit my Korean friend."}
{"text":"My buddies brought me to this place for the first time and absolutely fell in love with it. Ordered the Jalapeño vegas roll and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have the jalapeño Vegas roll and it was awesome. The service was excellent and I'll be back."}
{"text":"good for drinking and hanging out with friends! Excellent deal for sake bomber, especially during happy hours. Definitely worth coming back!"}
{"text":"While it says izakaya which is traditionally Japanese, there is definitely strong Korean influences on the menu, service was a bit lackluster.  Jumped between the happy hour (ends at 7 PM) and regular menu, the star of the show in terms of taste was the Bulgogi Mushroom Hot Pot.  Wide range of sake and soju, but no craft beers on the menu ... what a shame!"}
{"text":"The food is great but what's even better is the service! Our server was DJ (totally cool dude ) and he treated us amazingly well. I honestly felt like I was being served by a great friend trying to make me look good in front of my date. The food came promptly, the sake kept coming, and his sense of humor never waivered. Will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Great service and the food is absolutely delicious! The hot pots are really good"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and I really really wanted to love it- but we were fairly disappointed. We order the afredo seafood udon and the yaki udon, and both were very subpar which is unfortunate for the high end prices. The alfredo was really really standard and nothing I couldn't get from a grocery store, and in both entrees there was a ridiculous amount of onion. I really mean a crazy amount.  The good: there was a lot of seafood in each entree, which is great. I probably wouldn't come back though, due to the mediocre food for high prices."}
{"text":"Great food and good happy hour deals. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The skewers are delicious."}
{"text":"All those 5 starts for the mirin mackerel all the way! Very flavorful and deliciously done. The shishito peppers had an amazing kick to them. The eggdrop Seafood soup was a little on the milder side but tasted good while it was hot. Good ambiance and Best part is that they are open till 1am on a weekday !! Loved it."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! The waitress has an amazing memory when she took out order and was friendly and attentive. There was never a need to wave her down. Also a great Happy Hour"}
{"text":"So first glance, neat place! Great happy hour specials, and the vibe is good, not your typical sushi/Asian joint. It's more modernized and laid back.  Food wise, everything was on point. Sushi was on par with standard, good quality sushi. I got the Bolgogi grill and it was flavorful and juicy. Rice was standard but good and moist. They provided one type of soy sauce and it seemed to be low sodium so that was great, also it was a better quality than most standard sushi restaurants. For sushi I got the seared albacore and onion roll and the flavors meshed perfectly!   Staff wise, they were on point, quick with ordering and keeping up with everything. No complaints!  All in all, I'd come back! This place is open late and a great dive! Definitely on my travel food list!"}
{"text":"Overpriced with limited sushi options. When, we came it, they tried to get us to move next door(?) and sit in the bar area even though they had plenty of open seats in the dining room.  Not sure if they are not getting enough business in that area, but after we sat down, we watched as they sent a group of 5 over there and they all came back 30 seconds later.    Service was ok, nothing special; as the young girls move from serving tables to charging and checking their phones by the front desk.  The best part of the meal were the bulgogi tacos I ordered, so I assume some of the Korean dishes and skewers are good; but this is not a sushi place that we expected."}
{"text":"Come here to get hotpot with my girlfriend all the time, super good food. Saki bombs are pretty bomb, pretty fairly priced. The water Mmm the water is so good. Music is always pretty chill and Vegas roll are super lit fam."}
{"text":"Very good place love the bulgogi soup this place has the best in town love it. The soup is great and the reverse happy hour is great plus getting the free gyoza for this is golden"}
{"text":"Came here finally on my recommendation from a friend who is from Japan to come check it out....and also, because I probably pass here all the time and wanted to see how this place is since I love Japanese food.  On this day, I was a mood eater. I wanted to eat italian but, yet I wanted to eat japanese food..hahahahaha! Couldn't make up my mind, it's bad being a mood eater sometimes!  As we were driving in we saw this cute little bar area on the opposite of the restaurant and had no idea it is connected to Zu Izakaya until after we went into the restaurant.    Our host/waitress were really nice and talkative, she so funny I have a strong hawaiian pidgin accent so it's not hard to know that we are not from AZ and she picked up on it and asked \"Are you guys from Hawaii?\" we crack up laughing and I said yes, but now we live here.  She knows the struggle we have sometimes with finding really good asian foodies here in AZ.  So it was nice to just have the conversation with her and just connect.  Our food selection though it wasn't that bad at all...Everything that we had was super tasty and get this, I was surprised that they had a half pasta/udon dish that I never heard of and I just had to ask our waitress 'So, how is this?\" lol, She had told me that before their restaurant it used to be an italian place and their head chef had stayed on..she said that dish was super good and that I should try it. I am so glad that I did, I had exactly what I was craving for - how ironically funny! \"ASK AND I SHALL RECEIVE\" hahahahah....  Their dynamite scallops was good as well as their  tofu, it was refreshing and fulfilling at the same time for appetizer selection. I don't think the dynamite selection was an appetizer though- but, still good to go!  I love their sake special it really hit the spot although we missed the happy hour was still good!   However, the waitress did tell us that their bar area (the one I mentioned earlier of the little bar on the opposite side of the building). She said it is happy hour ALL day in their bar area but, it is not connected from inside of the restaurant.  So next time we come back, we'll go inside the bar area and they also have karaoke. Great place to bring my Ohana when they are in town...We love good food, drinks, and singing when we are merry/having a good time - PAU HANA time!   Ohh and there fried cheesecake dessert was winnaz....gotta sample it if they have it on their menu or specials"}
{"text":"YUM. After much deliberation, I got the poke bowl which was phenomenal. Love it!   It had the perfect balance of texture, spice and flavor. Also, the rice was perfectly seasoned and cooked which in my book, is a good indication of a good chef.   Next time, I'll have to try the chirashi. My friend got it and it looked great! The portions sizes were perfect. Not too big. Not to small. Just right."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambience is great, cozy and low key, great for dinner or getting drinks with friends.   Yummy food, reasonably priced, great happy hour menu, and James is great!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love this place! The atmosphere is awesome and the hot pot selection is unreal. Happy hour is from 4-7pm EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere. Their music is awesome. And what is the most important is that the dishes taste great! Come try it if you are around Phoenix. I bet you will love it if you are a sushi lover."}
{"text":"The atmosphere when you walk in is very retro. The meals they have on the menu is divine, classy with some awesome delicious dishes at a reasonable price! Wait staff are very friendly. And happy hour is a must! A place to come and visit!"}
{"text":"Great service and the sushi here is amazing. Our server was very attentive and the environment was clean and upbeat.  They also honor yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Had a quick weeknight dinner here, enjoying a few sushi rolls and some of our favorite izakaya appetizers! The service was fantastic, and the food was consistent. Definitely a great happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. They have two separate dining areas. One is a bar area and the other is the casual dining. Their food is really good but I have had better asian food in general. I would still recommend it for the variety of food selection they carry if you are not looking for something specific and just going with the flow."}
{"text":"Such a lovely atmosphere! Food is delicious. The shishito peppers are my favorite! I'm definitely coming back whenever I'm on this side of town! Just had the Alfredo udon with shrimp and it's literally the best thing ever! Happy hour is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour.  Friendly staff. Poke bowl with ahi is pretty  good for land locked City ! Will go back."}
{"text":"The salmon pico de gallo roll is bomb... The music is good and so is the service! First time here but will not be the last. Best sushi I've had in Scottsdale so far!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food! This place is considered Asian fusion food with some small dishes Korean style, we had a good meal with salmon carpaccio, hot pot, kalbi... everything came out good for a late night dinner"}
{"text":"This place is great! We were really excited to try their take on a sushi burrito, spoiler alert, it's delicious! We only ate sushi, but it was all delicious and service was pretty quick too! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Open late, later than most in Scottsdale.  One of a small handful of places in Scottsdale I go to for late night bite.    The food is very good, authentic.  They are known for their hot pots, but their entrees are tasty and flavorful.  Kalbi and sushi are good."}
{"text":"amazing happy hour deals. the food knocked the TITS off my girlfriend. wonderous soju and sake beverages and she slurped that yellowtail down like a brazzers champ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to in Arizona. I love the food.   The service here is GREAT and really fast. You can enjoy your food while listening to good music or something on tv.   The happy hour is also AWESOME bonus!!!"}
{"text":"probably the best izakaya in Phoenix. ordered two hotspots, soft shell crab, hamachi nigiri, salmon poke, Vegas roll. everything was great. would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came into Phoenix for the weekend and was craving sushi. Luckily there was a restaurant close to my hotel. After seeing the amazing reviews, I knew I had to try it!! We came in shortly after 9 and were blessed by the establishment's late night happy hour. The fish was super fresh, the atmosphere was trendy, and the customer service was amazing! We got to watch Cartoon Network while noshing on our rolls and sake bombs! Definitely coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mochiii (: bulgogi mushroom was delicious very flavorful and filling. Will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"This is our third time here within the last three weeks. Whether we're out with friends after a long week for drinks or winding down on a Sunday after a busy weekend, we enjoy the romantic atmosphere and trendy vibe this place brings. And the best part, all the food is delicious! Great take on Asian cuisine from Korean bbq to Japanese sushi.  We love trying new foods, so James and the staff are all awesome hosts and are constantly providing excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"Really good hotpot, with large portion sizes. Staff is friendly and nice, and the entire restaurant is extremely clean.We got the spicy kimchi hotpot, and it had ramen, pork, tofu, onions, and spam in it. First time visitors, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered gyoza, agadashi tofu, and the jjamppong hot pot. Everything was pretty good! The server answered all of our questions and was helpful."}
{"text":"Solid all around.    - The seafood hot pot (with noodles) was a great way to start.  Hearty, with a good broth - The hamachi wasabi had that buttery hamachi flavor with a nice kick to it - The saba was the best I've had in a long time.  Fishy, but not overpowering - The unagi was delicious and sweet as usual - The spicy tuna with garlic roll (fresh broiled garlic) was garlicky.  That's a good thing - The spicy edamame was delicious. Hard to go wrong with that sauce - The sriracha shrimp was good, but probably a touch too much sriracha - Dessert was meh (mochi ice cream), but that's kind of expected at a Japanese restaurant  - Service is a little slow, but the place was packed so that is to be expected - Very cool space.  Most of the good sushi joints in the Valley are pretty spartan.  Not Zu and I appreciated that"}
{"text":"I love their sushi and they also have special salmon sashimi that was awesome too and actually marinated Galbi is my favorite at all time. Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food! We got the bulgogi hot pot and Yaki udon. Kirin sakebomb was $7 for happy hour. The sake was alright, not very fresh taste. The hot pot is huge. Definitely for more than 2 people. The music is amazing. Chill lounge music and not loud. Good for both hang with friends and date night :)"}
{"text":"Yummy hot pot and delicious happy hour food! Big food size for happy hour. Good places for hanging out with friends!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times already. It's become one of my favorites. They have a variety of dishes to try and I have yet to try them all. So far, the bulgolgi was on point, and we've tried the bulgolgi mushroom hotpot which was delicious too. I've also tried their skewers. The scallops were ginormous! And cooked perfectly. We haven't had a bad experience yet and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Stopped into Zu to meet a friend for a small bite, at the interesting time between lunch and dinner. The restaurant was particularly empty considering it was Happy Hour.  Zu carries skewers, rice bowls, hot pots and of course alcohol. Was originally going to get a few skewers, the Poke Bowl caught my eye. Of course, when I think of Poke Bowls I'm used to in California it's typically a bowl of rice topped with marinated cuts of raw fish, fish eggs (masago or tobiko), ginger, scallions, seaweed strips or furikake (seaweed seasoning). The described Poke Bowl looked good, with descriptions of sauce and a choosing of Tuna or Salmon- I chose the latter. The bowl came out pretty quickly but was a marinated, saucy bowl of Salmon on top of hot white rice. The salmon tasted fresh, was soft and the sauce was savory, sweet and of course salty. The salmon was topped with seaweed strips. The only con for me was the price point for the portion. The bowl was about $10. Typically, Poke places will serve Poke bowls fast-casual/Chipotle style for about the same price. I believe if they added more toppings like fish eggs or even avocado it would make this bowl well worth the price.  The service was great. Place was very comfortable to sit and talk without feeling pressured to leave. However, the lock on one of the stalls in the female bathroom does not work. Parking is ample and the restaurant is conveniently located on the corner of North Scottsdale Road and Papago Drive.  Would like to come back to try their hot pots or skewers! ** Free hot sake when you order a hot pot here when you check-in on Yelp"}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi made it just in time to order a few things off that menu and then a lot more lol!  Goyza were fried and delicious, Las Vegas roll was bomb!  We also had some sashimi which had a good selection and the salmon was super fresh.  I'll be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after arriving from airport...only about 12 minutes from airport so really convenient!! Cute little Asian fusion place that has some skewer options and ramen with hot pot and korean dishes...and some sushi dishes. True fusion place!! Arrived at 9 PM, by chance, which was start of happy hour!! Off happy hour got agedashi tofu which was reasonable...relatively crunchy...flavor was good. Then got skewers of shrimp (tender and tasty), scallops (small but tasty), chicken (soft), meat ball (tender and good taste), and mushrooms (also good). Got the pork gyoza hot pot with clear noodle...little salty but big portion and pretty good!! The unagi rice bowl was reasonable and flavor was good but the unagi was not really crispy enough...so so. Overall about 3.5 stars so round up to 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"We started with the tofu, it was very good. The staff was very nice and first seated us at a table, once a booth opened up they asked if we wanted to move. Ordered the jalapeño Vegas roll and spicy garlic. Both roles were very good, only complain is I wish the rolls were bigger. Being on happy hour price, not a bad bang for your buck. Overall good, just wish the rolls were bigger."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The skewers really good and affordable. The butter corn is a must cop. I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful servers (Jojo in particular) who are kind patient and willing to explain things. It's my first time experimenting with some of this food and it as absolutely wonderful. The place is clean and has a wonderful laid back environment."}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere, really good food.  Kimchee hotpot was so good.  Shishito peppers delicious, really nice sauce.  Squid salad very tasty.  Will def be back.  Enjoyed the music selection as well.  Sake & soju bombs are a nice deal.  I look forward to trying more of the selections on the menu"}
{"text":"Good. Enjoyed happy hour. Crab cakes a bit over breaded.  Otherwise rolls as expected"}
{"text":"Great sushi and hot pots! The sushi is so fresh and the hot pot easily feeds two people white left overs. Happy hour is on certain drinks, sushi and appetizers from 9pm until 11pm daily   We had the garlic spicy tuna roll which was amazing!!! It was spicy so if you don't like hot food, then don't get this buy it was such a unique taste. We also had the salmon sashimi - talk about fresh and tasty! Hands down, best sushi I've had.  We had the Jjambbong hot pot which was also tasty but spicy.  It was a seafood and pork soup/broth that had ramen in it with rice on the side. This was a pretty big meal though so it's definitely for sharing.   All in all, next time in I'm Scottsdale, I will definitely be back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour. Fantastic prices. The poke bowl was absolutely delicious! Great service and can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely my favorite sushi spot (and happy hour) in Scottsdale! And the service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure....Im only halfway through my meal. I am already so in love! Everything is SPOT ON. The sushi burrito: I was nervous tbh. I can be a wimp sometimes. It was AMAZING! Garlic edamame was delicious. I will absolutely be back! And soon.   Oh and good prices too! Even specialty rolls are $10 - $12. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Sunday!! Amazing deals, and the bartender is a sweet heart!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and the food was delicious! Thanks to our wonderful server James."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites restaurants in Arizona! My best friends and I come here whenever possible and it's great that it's opened til 2AM during the weekends. I absolutely love the appetizers like the cheese spam Katsu and neobani sliders. The cheese spam is definitely a guilty pleasure since it's so heavy but it's perfectly crisp and cheesy. I'm also obsessed with their skewers, which are usually on their happy hour menu (did I mention they have HH and reverse HH?). The Scallop Dynamite is my all time favorite! It has scallop, salmon, cheese, and mushroom so it's basically everything I love in one. Their sushi rolls and burritos are great too. Honestly, I have yet to order something I didn't like from here.  I can't wait to come back.   P.S The white peach sake is only $9 during happy hour and it is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple. I don't think I can stop self from wanting to come here at least 3 times a week!! I am in love"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Came in for a late night snack.. had some tuna, salmon, the chili shrimp, and gyoza... everything was great!  Especially the shrimp!"}
{"text":"Food and service is awesome. The ambience is very chic and comfortable. The service is also great - the staff are very courteous. An absolute izakaya !!!"}
{"text":"Try the banana Japanese wine! Yum! Egg rolls, tempura were delicious and great prices."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout with friends! Taste good! I will recommend Kimchi tofu. It's also a great place to have some drink! Will come again."}
{"text":"Comfortable environment and great food.  First time here but I'll be back.  We got the tuna tartare, garlic chili edamame, and the Las Vegas roll and they were all good"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is attentive. My favorite dish was the squid legs! It has the perfect amount of crispiness and is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food , great staff, and great ambiance! Everything was great, the surprise of the night was the mushroom caps skewers....WOW! We also loved the jalapeño Las Vegas roll and the sriracha shrimp role. This is a must go and not expensive at all"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu and great skewers. Write a review for free gyoza or dessert!!! Lots of parking. Extensive menu. I got the galbi and gf got the chicken. Delish!!"}
{"text":"The food is great!! Try the chef ozamaka roll! Also, the service is good. There is a restaurant on one side and the bar on the other. Overall, good price for the value."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group of people. The place is pretty nice with great ambiance. We ordered quite a bit of food from the Hot Pot to the Bulgogi and a lot of little appetizers. Some of the appetizers were a hit or miss: The meat balls were fantastic but the things like the mushrooms or the scallops fall flat in terms of size and quantity. The best thing I saw there was the Muscle Hot Pot a friend of mine ordered. You get plenty of muscles and the broth is pretty good. The menu is pretty diverse and features a lot of different asian food from all countries."}
{"text":"The food wasn't really that great. I ordered a ramen with the tonkatsu broth and it was the most tasteless ramen I've ever had. I also ordered the eel and cucumber roll and regretted it. The rice was dry and the cucumber tasted off. The atmosphere was nice. It wasn't too loud or over crowded."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!!!!! Open late, cheap happy hour, amazing Korean and Japanese food!!!! Come here!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Clean. Ordered Jjambbong Pot 16.95 Korean style spicy assorted seafood (shrimp, u-10 scallop, black mussel, clam) soup with vegetable and noodle.  Very good!  Spicy. But not crazy spicy. Loaded with flavor. Only 2 shrimp. However loaded with everything else!  I seriously could not stop eating it!  You could enjoy all the seafood but the broth did not have an overwhelming seafood base. Just right I would say. Also had a happy hour item. A poke bowl. It was good. Had it with salmon. A little lite in the salmon. Seemed a little too much sesame oil flavor. However over all it was good!  There is a wide selection of udon soup, hot pots, sushi, salads Etc. great variety. Service was wonderful. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Elisa the bartender was courteous. Don't really like sushi spots where you can't see the chefs making the rolls, but the spicy tuna and Alaskan rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the gochujang salmon - raw salmon pieces in a spicy-sweet sauce with onions and avocado, served with rice ($14.95 for a fairly large portion.) We'd never had anything like it and were PLEASANTLY surprised. The lighting of the restaurant also creates a great vibe."}
{"text":"Great food. Server James really take good care of us .I had a cold tofu and my bf had sushi.Rverything isgood and yummy."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are great. They also have reverse happy hour starting at 9 for that late night grubbing. Try the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"It was bad service from start to finish! Sooooo disappointed, I don't want to go back ever!!! Take my advice ppl it was that bad"}
{"text":"the sushi was great. a balanced mix of rice. i highly recommend getting something on the \"special rolls\" portion of the menu. service was astute. really just a great place to come with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"#1 Best izakaya place in Arizona. variety Menu delicious food Friendly servers Everyting are boom!!!!! What are you waiting for!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the atmosphere was welcoming.   Excellent service and attention to details while explaining the dishes.  Nice way to start. They open till 1 am and also have reversed happy hours from 9-11 pm.  The food however is just ok.  We would not come back."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it's always great, especially for happy hour. Staff is helpful and attentive. I usually get the spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"Wanting to try something new, I was very curious about their \"tapas\" style portions. When I walked in, I was greeted by a host and then had the options of two tables.   Zu had a really great selection of food - skewers, hot pot, sushi/sashimi. I ordered the pork (8.5/10) and steak (3/10) skewer. From the sashimi menu, I ordered the salmon and seared tuna. The size of the sashimi was a little on the smaller side. The salmon was okay. I would recommend the seared tuna - 9/10. From the hotpot menu, I ordered the Nagasaki Seafood Pot - comes with assorted seafood, vegetables and ramen noodles. I added spam on the side too but the server forgot about it. There wasn't anything too special about it for the price $16.95. I probably wouldn't order it again.   I think overall the restaurant is ok. I wouldn't make the drive all the way from N. Scottsdale just to come here but if I am ever in the area, I would definitely stop in for the cheap skewers!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Phoenix, were hungry and it was about 10:30pm. We looked on Yelp for anything with late night dining around the Tempe area and we found this place. Thank you Yelp! This was such a good suggestion for a late night dinner and we really liked the food. They have Japanese food and also varieties of Korean food. We were also lucky enough to make it just in time for happy hour and took advantage of the cheap appetizers. I really liked the sushi burrito, shisito peppers, and the kkanpungi (korean style deep fried chicken with sweet spicy marinade). Definitely try this out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago and was surprised by how good the food was. We ordered the kkanpungi (Korean fried chicken with sauce) and the grilled chicken, which was served on a sizzling hot skillet. Both dishes were served with a bowl of white rice. Both chicken dishes tasted phenomenal. The rice was sticky and cooked to perfection.  They have a lot of seafood options, which made me sad, as I don't have a taste for things from the ocean. But if you're into that kind of thing, I bet it's great! Besides seafood they do have a lot of other options. For next time I've got my gaze set on the coconut curry hot pot...  I would not hesitate to come back. The food is on the pricey side, but if you can afford it, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy Japanese food and alcohol. Food come out fast and customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"Really good. Have the recommended soju for happy hour, and inspired garlic edamame. The Korean fried chicken and pork meals are excellent. Good flavor and value."}
{"text":"Love June and his all day happy hour. I come here all the time. Service is great, food is awesome, and drink selection is on point. Hands down my favorite place to go too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a late night munch, this is the place to go! I come here after football games and it never disappoints. Their gyoza and crab cakes for appetizers are delicious. I always order the Jjambbong Pot and it's to die for. The flavor of the soup just had the right amount of spice and the seafood always hit the spot. Our waiter, James, was so nice and friendly. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"I just moved in the area and came here with my boyfriend about a month ago for happy hour after seeing the great prices online. The place is super easy to find and the parking lot is pretty decent. We didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. The service was good, our waitress was nice and made sure everything was tasting good and nothing was wrong with our meal. The edamame is great, perfectly cooked and salted. My boyfriend got a poké bowl which was delicious! I got the jalapeño Las Vegas roll which was the best sushi roll I've had in a while. The prices are great, I definitely recommend taking advantage of the happy hour here to save money! I definitely will come back for delicious sushi that tastes great and is also greatly priced!"}
{"text":"Zu serves good food, with a great happy hour, and awesome service and even karaoke!   The happy hour had deals on sake, sapporo, as well as skewers and other food items. The quesadilla came with a whole side of honey which was interesting fusion I guess, and the hamburger skewer had nice flavor and interesting texture.  As for food I ordered a beef and mushroom hot pot, which came in a mini cauldron. The broth was soul warming and the beef was good. I liked the enoki mushroom and the noodles too. I tried a bit of the poke and tuna tartare and they were both refreshing. I heard the korean hotpot was also really good.  Eventually, we had the restaurant to ourselves and they let us use their karaoke machine! Our waitress said we made her night. Perfect way to end the meal, buzzed or not!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Excellent hot pot, yummy skewers. Nice diverse menu. Bulgogi salad - sounds odd but it works!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is solid. Authenticity touched with experimentation. Classy without being pretentious and stuffy. Fusion surprises on the menu that are blowing away the tastebuds. The staff is friendly and sweet. It seems they enjoy working here and know the menu. This is as good as you can get in SoScottsdale, maybe even the East Valley."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. From the great food/drinks to the awesome conversations you will have with all the employees. All skewers are delicious and the Yellowtail Carpaccio is the last thing I would like to eat before I die. Will be back to this place weekly if not more."}
{"text":"Great variety of sushi rolls were all delicious. Highly recommend the Zu Poke Bowl and the baked scallop roll and the Vegas roll. We came here hungry and tired, and the food was great and came out quickly and the waitress was nice. Reverse happy hour made it affordable too."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices here! It is worth the drive in my opinion! Try the kkanpungi it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Yelp check in got us free edamame. Nice. So, here's the thing: they are promoting free food items on tent cards on their tables for people to write Yelp reviews while dining. Free food is motivating, but they are good enough that they shouldn't be doing this. Shame on them.  Crowded Friday night.  Very friendly service. But: S-L-O-W. Easily 30 minute wait to be seated with tables that could have been cleared that entire time. Service was slow to get order in, to get food out and in between courses. All the while, the too-few server staff were leaving empty tables which could have been cleared to seat the growing line of people waiting to dine. Several just left. Too bad. The food is really, really good!  Tuna sashimi app was excellent though pricey as was the gyoza. Spicy chili shrimp was off the charts good. The grilled pork was only ok and not something I would get again. Green tea ice cream just didn't seem all that necessary when it was valued the same as the gyoza for the Yelp freebie. So no dessert for us even though the friendly server did suggest it.  Once done dining, I kid you not, it took more than 30 minutes to get the tab taken care of. Once the server came to pick up the check with my CC, which I put down the instant the check came, the processing was quick. But, 30 minutes?"}
{"text":"Really great place if you want a good variety. And they have sushi burritos!!! I had been searching for those throughout Scottsdale area and this place had it. Really nice atmosphere as well. Great house sake. Surprised it's not busier here at nights."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places if we crave Asian food in Scottsdale, AZ. The menu selection is really great, along with a nice Happy Hour menu!   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had flew in late at night and were feeling hungry after hauling luggages around all day; we searched for a non-fast food join and were lucky to have found this place that was open until 2am!! Great service, amazing portions, and quality food!!!!! Perfect place for drinks or for just a nice intimate meal. 10/10 would come back and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Great service! My friends and I went here to wind down after a long day of work. Our bartender Kevin was awesome, this place has a great vibe to it."}
{"text":"The amazing guys behind Bei Sushi have done it again. I love the shishito peppers and sushi burrito. It's fantastic that they serve food so late. Great option to eat in the secluded bar area if you want a quick and casual bite. Happy hour from 4-7 and starts again at 9. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Tempe area. The Tagarashi Tuna Roll is literally the most unique sushi roll I have ever had. Totally recommend. They also have real fresh wasabi.  I hate all of the chain restaurants. This one is the best non chain sushi restaurant I found around downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Chicken kabobs are the BOMB and their sushi rolls are delicious. Servers are SUPER generous and funny. DEFINITELY COMING BACK SOON!!!"}
{"text":"pleasant surprise. try the scallop roll and jalapeno las vegas roll from the signature dishes. Flavorful. Generous serving of the mixed tempura. I would come back. Better than other japanese restaurants in old town."}
{"text":"Stayed at an airport hotel traveling thru Phoenix Sky Harbor.  This gem was a couple of miles away. Ate early and hit Happy Hour.  Shared a Sashimi combo bowl, chicken and meatball skewers, edamame, and egg roll.  Sashimi was amazing, fresh, flavorful. Combo bowl indicated vegetables, which were not apparent- some shredded daikon?  But sushi rice in bowl was great. Meatballs were a little off-but couldn't quite put my finger on what was off. They were all eaten anyway LOL. Everything else was well prepared and tasty. Happy hour Shapiro on draft $3- Woodbridge wine $6.00."}
{"text":"Overall great experience for an Asian fusion place in Phoenix. We went during happy hour and ordered two skewers, a octopus in ponzu sauce appetizer, Jjambbong hot pot and house sake.   Food overall 4 stars - Skewers: both chicken and pork are juicy and tender and very flavorful. - Octopus in ponzu sauce: the flavor in the sauce is well balanced.  - Jjambbong hot pot:  it's hard not to compare with the authentic hot pot I had in California... The soup tasted like the ramen package seasoning and little diluted for my liking. Probably would taste really good if you come in hungry late night lol  Services and environment 5 stars - Nice atmosphere and very attentive services! I would definitely recommend for groups and pre-game LOL"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere and staff! Spicy crab roll is the best I've ever had. Very relaxed atmosphere makes this a great date night spot.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We got edamame, gyoza, angry caterpillar roll, and the sushi burrito. They were all really great! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went here last night before a concert. I called perhaps 2 hours in advance and told them my situation and the girl (Katrina??) who took my call was very polite and very accommodating. She was able to give us a table of 6 and take my reservation. We sat down and started off w blueberry soju, the garlic chili edamame, gyoza and the cheese spam katsu. Did I tell you they have happy hour till 7pm even on weekends?? U know most restaurants don't offer happy hour on weekends. So a lot of the appetizers we ordered was on the happy hour menu. The garlic chili edamame was amazing!! And the cheese spam katsu was very tasty as well!! There were three pieces which we all shared. It brought me back to my childhood days. For my main entree, I was torn w so many of the amazing options... did I want sushi, or grilled Korean BBQ, or the many choices of hot pots?? I ended up going w the spicy kimchi hot pot which had spam, mushroom, pork and ramen. It was really good but quite the portion. It's meant to be shared so of course I couldn't finish it. I had the left overs for lunch today! Yum!! I'll definitely be coming back to try the other hot pots and dishes!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food. This is honestly my favorite restaurant in the valley. The chicken curry was incredible!!!! Honestly surprised they're not packed at all times."}
{"text":"Searching for an awesome Asian fusion experience in south Scottsdale? Then look no further than Zu Izakaya.   Unpretentious - this is definitely a great little spot to get your fix. The service is spot on, the food & drink menu is impressive, and the quality is top notch.  After stopping in for the first time, on my birthday in mid-August, I've decided that this is going to be my go-to sushi joint.  From their most basic sashimi and nigiri to their more creative rolls and  Sushi Burrito, I was thoroughly satisfied with the selection and left happy with a full belly and a smile on my face.  I have a feeling that you will to. Be sure to stop in and stay at Zu Izakaya for their Happy Hour specials and let the adventure begin. Now pass the Soju and Sake!  KANPAI!!!"}
{"text":"We found this on Yelp and decided to drop in. The food was EXCELLENT. We got the Jjambong hot pot and it was delicious. One hot pot was enough for two people. I would highly recommend getting one. The menu was pretty good and the service was high quality. We also got some sushi which was pretty fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"ggood service!I love the happy hours and sushi bowls! They open till late, good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere it has a very chill vibe. Open late which is great. The food is always on point. So far I have tried the Bulgogi Tacos, Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza, and the Spicy soft Tofu Pot. Drinks are always fairly priced. Service is fast"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour.  It was really hot inside, maybe the AC was off or not working?  Ordered a spicy tuna roll and it was worse than grocery store sushi.  Also ordered the egg rolls, they were too greasy.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"The food was very plain, ramen was made from instant noodle. Bulgogi was very basic. Not enough flavor I could cook better than this place. If you want authentic korean Japanese food,  skip this place. Not worth the money. I can cook instant ramen on my own."}
{"text":"We arrived right after a rainstorm and were feeling chilly ( in Az. This is odd I know!)so we ordered the hot pot. It was so plentiful and delicious, we'll be back. Good thing they're open past 9 p.m. Since everything in the area seems to close so early."}
{"text":"Awesome pace! First date? Friend meet up? Want to meet new people?   This is a great spot! The food is tasty, the drinks are delicious, and the staff is very friendly and helpful!  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, good price, Amazing place!  Egg rolls are a must, and the Chili garlic edamame... Amazing."}
{"text":"Such a cool place to come across! I love that they are open late night. This will be my new after-work spot for food and drinks."}
{"text":"OMG...get here. This place was nothing short of fantastic. We got here at 4 and had the place to ourselves. The happy hour is so great. We had the  potstickers, spring rolls, skewers of pork and chicken,coconut curry hot pot, the short ribs, the tofu....jesus, all of it was outstanding!  Free bottle of sake for your 1st checkin with yelp too! Sami was our server and was on top of it. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Oh yeah, we had mango ice cream dusted with a rice flour. Everything. ...amazing."}
{"text":"First time coming here and enjoyed every minute of it. Food was really good, service was quick and pleasant, and good atmosphere. Would definitely come here again. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is great Elisa was our server and bartender. We came here for happy hour and it was great. You walk in and tell them your there for happy hour and they walk you to the back that's totally separate from the restaurant. Different at atmosphere for sure but I love it. Hot pots are a must and sushi lollipop."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Great happy hour and awesome service. Kevin, Jojo, and Jay are super attentive. We come here every week and are never disappointed. Haven't had a bad thing on the menu. Definitely check out the bar for all day happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went to this place when they first opened. Not a bad spot, was empty when i went a few montha ago, but food is decent and drink specials are like Bei Sushi(Same Owner) Kinda overpriced food for what you get. I might go back again, but wouldn't be a spot i go to regularly."}
{"text":"The food was brought out way quicker than excepted and was fresh and delicious! I loved the music and the overall vibe of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Really good sushi, really good service. My mom and I went twice when I was out to visit over Memorial Day weekend, once during a late happy hour, and then once more for early dinner. The rolls were great both times (we stuck to California, Philly, and shrimp tempura), and the second time we also had the yellowtail nigiri, which was fantastic.  Overall, a very solid choice for fresh, well-made sushi, and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the vibes are awesome, they have good music and the food is fucking delicious."}
{"text":"Our food was mixed. Salmon kama and scallop hand roll were good. Tuna and mackerel nigiri were not good at all, mainly due to the rice. No flavor, dry, not formed well, cold. But no question, our biggest complaint is the overwhelming smell of bathroom cleaner that permeated the entire restaurant. We thought it was maybe a fluke because we came in near the bathrooms at the front door, but it was evident in the dining room as well. No one should use that amount of fabulosa. Gross."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Very clean! Great service, and good vibes. Stop in if you want a great sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Love it! Great late night go-to.  Love the garlic spicy roll and chili garlic edamame."}
{"text":"Imagine plate after gorgeous plate of delicious Asian apps and entrees. Our party of five started out with sake & soju all around. The crisp apple soju was a sweet treat, but the unfiltered pear was even better. We started out with a few typical choices - edamame, bbq pork and chicken skewers, and delicate veggie tempura. Then we wandered through a zesty squid salad and fresh seaweed salad, both were terrific. We loved the crispy gyoza dumplings, the incredibly flavorful tuna tartare, and the udon noodles flavored with zucchini and beef, and finally the spicy fried chicken. Every single dish was perfectly prepared, delivered graciously, and so so good. I cannot wait to get back here and try a few more items on the menu. We were too early for their sushi menu, but it looked pretty good too. Loved it Loved it Loved it."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for a Sushi place and opted for this place. We walked in and where seated pretty quickly. We sat down and started with egg roles and edamame (which was free with Yelp check in).  Our items came out quickly. I was impressed with the menu. My daughter and husband opted for sushi rolls and I had a seafood pot. I must say I really enjoyed the options, the food was hot and very fresh. Our waitress always Checked on us. Great service! Although this place is far away from my home, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First off, this is the BEST sushi spot in the valley! Great quality of seafood, amazing service (Kevin, Jay & Jojo,) and delightful atmosphere! I come here at least twice a week, sometimes more! You need to check this place out! I would recommend the Jalapeño Vegas Roll, Baked Scallop Roll, Crab Cakes and the Jalapeño Poppers stuffed with crab. I can guarantee you will never have a bad meal or experience here! This place and the staff are the BEST!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I checked out this place before now?! I am so lucky to live nearby so I can become a regular here!  Everything I tried was great. Love the casual feel, great service, and prices were very reasonable. Even more amazing happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.   Favorite thing ordered was the Las Vegas Roll. My husband loved his spicy garlic tuna roll and my shrimp tempura roll was also great. The chili garlic edamame was quite spicy but yummy. Veggie egg rolls and crispy shrimp with mayo sauce also hit the spot.    So much to try! Can't wait to return. Next time I want to try a hot pot or soup. I also want to at least peep my head in to check out their separate bar area."}
{"text":"We loved our sever! She was funny, witty and super helpful. Her name is Leah- request her! We also loved the food. We started with the calamari, which was very yummy. All of our sushi was delicious and fresh. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We live right down the street and love coming here! The egg rolls are AMAZING! We ordered a second one because they were so good. I've even sent my husband down to grab a side of rice for a dinner I cooked at home. I can't wait to see how the happy hour is!"}
{"text":"I was having a stressful work week and feeling completely tense even after it was over. My stomach felt like there was a knot and needed something to be done right away. On my way home, I called up Karen W to see if she had any dinner plan. She said no (WOOO HOOOO!!! happy dance) and that was how we ended up here last night.   As soon as we arrived, a table was already reserved/set up for us. The restaurant is definitely well decorated with dark walls, a wall decorated with many pieces of small mirrors and with lots of beer bottles in the middle of the bar table. I can see this place getting really busy during the weekends for college kids. If you are here with your date, this place could also be relaxing and romantic. Throughout the entire meal, we ordered many skewers and appetizers to share with including (but not limited to) Aghi Tofu, poki bowl, Korean beef, chicken wings, sushi burritos, cheese spam, quail eggs, asparagus, meat balls and finishing up the entire meal with a beautifully decorated Eel dish. My favorite was the poki bowl and the sushi burritos. Both dishes were so refreshing and the rice was just at the right temperature. My second favorite was the Eel dish. The presentation was so good I almost didn't want to eat it. I've always enjoyed inexpensive small bites which allows me to try different variety of food. Everything is tasty except the cheese spam that we ordered. I cannot taste the spam and the only taste that was left in my mouth was the cheese. It was too overpowering for me. If you like cheese, however, this might be it for you.   During dinner, I did see the owner walking around checking up on everyone from a distance at the corner of my eye. I thought that was sweet. I would have given this restaurant a 5 star if it wasn't because our waitress was throwing around an attitude when we first got here. She walked away without taking my friend's order. Instead of apologizing, she walked back with an attitude showing us know that she was annoyed. I wasn't very happy with that. However, her attitude did improve towards the end of the night and did check up on us often. I do appreciate her attitude adjustment.  If you are a fan of Korean/Japanese food as well as soju and sake, this is the place to be. I did see some happy hour menu with reasonable prices. We ate so much and the total only comes to $75 including tax. I will most definitely come back here again to try something else. Thank you Karen W and Zu Lazkaya for making my night better. I walked away happy towards the end of the night."}
{"text":"Love going to this place!! It's always open late so I can get my fix of Asian food whenever  favorite dishes include the veggie yaki udon and the eel cucumber roll! James has been my server every time I have been here, big shout-out to his great service and friendly demeanor"}
{"text":"We visited Zu while in town for a few days. The service was good and menu had good variety. My daughter is very picky and she loved the chicken skewer.   We tried a few sushi rolls and they were hit or miss. I would have liked to try a few more but liked the garlic spicy tuna. The jalapeño vegas roll was not my favorite."}
