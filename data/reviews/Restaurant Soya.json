{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service, however did not enjoy the food. Appetizer portions are tiny and main the quality of the main meal seemed far from authentic. My teriyaki was drenched in sauce, loosing any other flavours in the dish. My friend took general tao and we struggled to find the chicken."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Laval. From the outside it's not very welcoming but when you get inside, the decor, lighting, and asian atmosphere is simply wonderful. On our latest visit we tried the teriyaki terre et mer and I would recommend this dish to everyone. Their vegetables were very fresh and the service is impeccable, servers always had a smile on their face. According to our waiter, Korean Food will be available starting next week. Can't wait to try that out. I've tried looking for a Korean Restaurant here in Laval and there's none so I think they'll be the first."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, bon menu, bon service! Cette première visite nous oblige à récidiver! C'est une belle découverte!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant , parking is kind of a pain to get there (too crowded because of the near by gym) but the food is worth it. I find it a little pricy for a vietnamese/chinese/asian restaurant but everything they serve is really fresh and tasty.  Good first date restaurant !"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect as usual. The decor, the music, the staff, the dimmed lighting, and if course the food! Don't miss the fried ice cream dessert!"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, beau menu.  Je vous conseille vivement de réserver...car c'est souvent plein."}
{"text":"Pros :  - Friendly waiter service, water refills came regularly.  - Food was prompt, no waiting.  - Beautiful atmosphere and ambiance. Romantic options are possible.  - The imperial rolls were fantastic.    Cons :  - Waiter kind of strongly recommended to choose specific meals and didn't bother to ask if we wanted something to drink beyond water.  - I ordered the General Tao which was rather oddly crunchy (felt overdone) and more than mild tasting. Simply not the best General Tao I ate. My significant other felt her Basil Beef was uninspiring as well and drenched with sauce.  - Prices a little steep for the quality of the food as well as smaller portions than accustomed to.    Overall a nice place to go eat, especially for an exotic romantic meals as it is set for ambiance and scenery. The service is very decent but expect an emphasis on a somewhat pricey gastronomic presentation rather than quality of the meal."}
{"text":"J'ai revisité cet ancien amour. J'étais une habituée mais ai perdue intérêt au fil du temps. Il refait surface grâce à des collègues de travail. Toujours aussi jolie. Service courtois et rapide pour l'heure du midi. Bien qu'un menu est disponible pour le repas du midi, le serveur nous permet de commander des plats qui se retrouvent uniquement sur le menu du soir. J'ai commandé le poulet à la citronnelle. Ma table d'hôte comprend soupe, repas et rouleau pour 12$. Le plat est bien présenté, un peu fade. Le rouleau pourrait être plus gros. Les lychées frits comme desserts sont toujours aussi bons et différents des bananes et pommes frites offertes dans les autres restaurants du même type. Je lui donnerai une autre chance."}
{"text":"Came here for another work luncheon.  Ambiance and decor has not changed in this place since my first review.    For my lunch I had the Nid poulet (chicken with crunchy fried noodles + vegetables).  Flavour quality and taste was very good and they do this dish just as I have eaten here on other occasions.    I would claim that lunch is the best value (compared to eating dinner) here.  Just my nid (I drank the table water) with tax and tip was a tad north of $16 (just me).  Good value for a decent lunch that will fill you up!   A good quality in a restaurant is consistency and Soya doesn't disappoint in this regard."}
