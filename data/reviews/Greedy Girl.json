{"text":"Had expectations for something tasty. Unfortunately fell short. We had the Frankie's and gyro. The paratha was tasty but the chicken was dry and had very little flavor. The gyro was a disaster. Meat was the kind you buy in a grocery store pre cut/frozen. Then we get to the okra fries. Sounds interesting and I love okra,but in reality they were shoe string slices of okra roasted to a crisp and tasted like burnt fiber. Hope this place can stay open and improve just to add some variety to the food scene. Perhaps they should focus on less menu items and do them well."}
{"text":"Nice quiet little cafe with yummy Indian as well as Greek style \"street food\" dishes that are a grab and go delight!  Don't miss it, there's no one else in the area with this combination of mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Indian and Greek street food served in a bright, but tiny location. I called in a takeout order, and was informed that some of the items on the website were no longer being served, but my second choice dish - the souvlaki - was the perfect lunch for a chilly day. It wasn't very pretty or fancy (after all, it is street food) but the spices on both meat and potatoes were delicious and the meal was filling. The baklava was the best I've tasted - wonderfully flaky and not overly sweet. I'm looking forward to trying the okra fries next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Greedy Girl at least a half dozen times since it opened. My goal is to try everything on the menu. I love this place! It's a perfect spot for a casual breakfast or lunch when you're in the mood for something a little different. The menu features Greek and Indian specialties. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch and it was really great! Price point was solid for a good amount of food. I ordered the Fry Girl (spicy) and I loved it. The cashew curry dipping sauce was great. I will say that their version of \"spicy\" is not really spicy at all. I also wouldn't mind if you could have an option of adding chicken to this sandwich (I'm not sure that you couldn't ask and they would oblige...but there's no mention of it on the menu). Still excellent though. The outside was fluffy and crispy and warm, and the inside was ooey goodness with marsala potatoes, cheese and cauliflower I think. The hubs ordered The Frankie with chicken and he loved his as well. We also got a spanakopita and it was the best I've ever had. Definitely going back! The owner was also super friendly and attentive. I hope this place sticks around and extends its hours!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a flavor favor and go to Greedy Girl's Ethnic Street Flavors in Cleveland Heights! I've posted a picture of yesterday's breakfast. It was so delicious that I forgot I wanted to post a picture. I'd eaten half my Greek Omelet before I took the shot. It's like a spinach Omelet in phyllo dough. And that ketchup in the photo is homemade! The home fries are fresh and have Greek spices.  You have to taste their food because it defies easy descriptions. The owner/chef creates flavor blends from her favorite Greek and Indian cuisines. She can adjust the spiciness. They are open for breakfast and lunch, Wed. - Sun. You can also call ahead and pick up dinner from 4-6 when they've closed their dining room.   I'm vegetarian and there are lots of options for non-meat eaters, even vegans. But my omnivore husband has loved everything he's tried.   I've never had to wait long and the servers are so friendly. Each time I've been there I've wound up chatting with other patrons.  It's that kind of place. There is seating for about 20 people so you can go with friends! I'm so happy Eust, the owner, opened it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Indian and Greek street food. My husband and I both had the Frankie sandwich. It was delicious. The okra fries are amazing as well. I would return here if in the Cleveland area again."}
{"text":"We Had the frankie, sali boti sandwich and mushroom puffs. The food is really good! Wishing all the best to the owners and hoping to having this place around for a long time."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday around noon (note they close at 2pm on Sunday).   We were quickly greeted by the woman working at the front counter who asked if we had dined there before.  After we let her know that it was our first time, she made some menu suggestions, although she also informed us that some of the suggested items (and other items) were sold out for the day.    We selected the Samosas (half meat and half vegetarian), the Frankie (one of the available recommendations) and an order of fried okra.  We then helped ourselves to the self serve water, silverware and napkins.  The place was nearly full (it seemed most people were enjoying breakfast/brunch items).   About 15-20 minutes passed and our food arrived hot and fresh.  The Frankie was very delicious and filled with Indian spices.  The fried okra was also very good.  I just wish the girl at the front would have told us that the Frankie comes with a side of fried okra since the extra order was a giant portion that nearly all went to waste.    The samosas came out a few minutes later.  They are not traditional samosas like you would find in Indian restaurants but are made with a more flakey shell/dough (maybe filo).  Before we could dig in the manager (owner?) came over and apologized saying that she had to take the samosas back because the meat ones were made with old/spoiled ingredients.  We were definitely glad she stopped us before we ate them, although it was a little awkward.  She offered to make us a new order of veggie only, which we accepted.  The new batch was good, very hot and flavorful but a little on the greasy side.  The dipping sauce they come with is excellent though.    We will go back probably a little earlier so that we can try some of the items that they ran out of."}
{"text":"Good attempt to bring fast food Greko/Indian style.  Owner cook has the heart and she genuinely wants to bring different flavors to Cleveland.  Nice decor.  Okra fries are tasty - Samosa with Phyllo dough not good - perhaps for shortcut empanada discs will work better.  Yes cookies are great too."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wait for them to open. The food is delicious. The cookies are perfect. The owner is a genuinely kind. I highly recommend this establishment. I love the masala dosa and samosas. The coconut cashew sauce is amazing. Dig it. It is cool."}
{"text":"Ordered Greek salad with gyro meat. Gyro meat had a curry flavor. Also ordered the Greek chicken wings. The flavor was good, but they were a bit undercooked and were very small. The total price for lunch was $25. It seemed to be a bit overpriced for the quantity of food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Especially the breakfast. Owner really cares about her guests and quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place was just amazing. I've never found a good place for Indian street food that does a good job, and this place blew our socks off. It had all the street treats I grew up with a child, along with plenty of Greek delicacies. It's run by a passionate Greek lady who spent time with Parsi friends in Bombay, and who clearly picked up a flair for delivering on the mumbai street culinary experience.   The bhel puri and dosa were tasty, and just crisp enough, and had all the elements to bring me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"So....I was fooled once again from yelp reviews. I finally went to greedy girl after months of reading the rave reviews of their \"yummy\" food. So today I had some free time and wanted to go and sample some of the greatness that people speak of. I walked into the establishment and there were no other customers around....that right there should've been a sign for me to turn around and get something else to eat. Unfortunately I didn't listen to my gut and ordered anyway. I ordered the #7 which is called The Frankie, which comes with okra fries and and yogurt based salad....I've heard soooo many good things about it so I had to try it. I waited for about 15 minutes for my food which isn't bad because I know it's made to order, which I love. And since it was my first time there, the guy gave me a couple of coupons for my next visit. Which I was super excited about. When I received my food I didn't open up the container I just peaked through it, which was a big mistake. As I'm driving home my car starts stinking, I came to the realization that it's my food stinking up my car. I opened it up and it had the overwhelming aroma of eggs. I was instantly turned off. I thought that since this was a Indian sandwich I would smell more curry or some other delicious spice....NOT EGG!!! I took 1 bite and I had to spit it out. It was DISGUSTING!!! When I got home I tried to see if I could pick around it since I paid for it. I tried and tried but I just couldn't do it... I tried the okra fries and they were nasty. Then I tried the yogurt based salad....IT WAS HORRIFIC. It tasted like how a musty man would smell after playing 4 hours of basketball and not showering. Overall it was such a disappointment. I threw everything out, including those coupons. I WILL NEVER BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been able to sit down here yet, so I'll update when I do. I got take out.   This place is certainly a bit overpriced; but it is kinda worth it! The Indian style wings are the BOMB. Really good.   I personally love okra. Their okra fries were real good but they were a little too crispy and oily at times.   I also had the baklava waffle. I was torn between that and the challah French toast but was leaning towards the latter. Of course, that day they were out of the challah French toast (filled with cream cheese apparently, btw. YUM) so I got the waffle. It was really good the first 5 bites or so, but it was kind of dry. It's good to know everything is probably fresh since they run out of items (they also said they were low on okra).   I had the cauliflower side + the corn side. Both were good but I felt like they were not worth $3 something. The corn felt lacking in taste, but I liked the cool flavors they were going for with the lime, the chili powder, and the cheese. The cauliflower was good enough to me."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we try this place, and listening to the description made me wary, but the food was phenomenal! The restaurant was very welcoming and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, absolutely iffy service  Indo-Greek street food (with Zoroastrian overtones, according to a Pakistani friend of mine) in Cleveland Heights. Chicken frankie comes from the Indian side, with chicken stuffed inside an eggy paratha, topped with onion sauce, cilantro, onions, and tomatoes. Absolutely out of this world. Curried cauliflower was very good too, and I didn't mind the coconut milk in it. Side is usually okra fries, but due to the earthquake in Mexico and hurricanes, okra prices have gone up.  Service is unconcernedly diffident, though. Waited at the front counter for 5 minutes before I finally stepped into the kitchen to get someone to take my order.  The employee nonchalantly took my order without apologizing for my inconvenience.  In addition, the prices are somewhat of a bad value.  Okra prices is out of their control, but only replacing that substantial side with 5 pieces of potato is insufficient for the price.  The cauliflower in the photo was a separate order that I replated myself, so the plate otherwise would've been a whole lot of blank space.   Food is easily five stars, but that makes the service shortfall even more devastating."}
{"text":"Got: deep-fried okra, 1/2-1/2 samosas, the frankie, sali boti. All good and you cannot go wrong with any.  Why five stars? Well, the food is de-lish. Also, the owners are awesome. They are so personable, and reminds me I live in a nice place with nice people.   Five star calculation: (5 for food, 5 for service, 5 for decor) / 3 - 1 for not being open for dinner + 1 for being open at 7(:30)am + 1 star for great coffee + 1 star for clean toilet - 2 stars for being next to mister brisket (i can't choose!!!) = 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Great place to get your Greek/Indian fix.  More based on street food dishes. Great price and wonderful atmosphere. Something for the whole Famaly to enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent food in appropriate portions. Super friendly staff. Cozy feel with good tunes"}
{"text":"There's a reason we have been there three times in the past week. Spice that's so refreshing and just pops in your mouth with bright crisp delightful flavor! The Indian food is Rich, warm, filling and definitely one of the more unique flavors now in Cleveland Heights. And very well priced. I haven't had mango lassi like that in a long time and it really takes me back to times in India. I haven't yet tried the Greek food, because I can't stop eating the Indian food. Strongly. Encourage everyone in the nearby community to support this lovely new business. I really appreciate that the cafés open early in the morning, I only wish that it were open for dinner time. Anticipate that in the future it will be a great place to lounge, snack on the okra fries, sip on Mango Lassi, and read a book or peruse the Internet"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Was expecting the food to be Indian and Greek- fusion style. The owner is Greek and just happens to love Indian food. She did a great job of capturing the essence of some of my favorite classic Indian dishes. We tried the Parsi pora omelette, okra fries, Bombay bhel puri, and a few other items. The okra fries and bhel puri were SO flavorful. I truly enjoyed their food and will be back to try the other items. The icing on the cake was the extremely friendly owner, she saw me struggling with my cover when I needed to nurse my newborn there and made me feel comfortable, by stating I didn't need it and if someone has a problem, they could leave. While I proceeded with the cover to avoid stares, I will say as a new mom, facing many challenges that come with nursing, that comfort meant a lot to me. She also brought out samples of a new item she wanted our feedback on. Looking forward to trying this cozy place again soon! I only wish it was around when I lived walking distance from it :)"}
{"text":"So, I love food fusions that are interesting and tasty; I found BOTH (plus a really cool name,)  at this wonderful little place in Cleveland Heights!   After a fortuitous suggestion by my Wife to stop off, we were treated to some of the best food I've had in ages. Patty got a dish combining the merits of a spicy-sweet onion curry, along with okra fries, something I'm looking forward to getting more of! I got a breakfast combo of a wonderful Greek-style omelette wrapped in a home-made pita that was absolutely fabulous. Along with that, got a side of a spicy onion/cauliflower/coconut dish that was amazing, and you should try their spnakopita,  it makes a great treat as well.   I have also heard tell of a mystical combo of something that sounds...amazing; A BELGIAN BAKLAVA WAFFLE BREAKFAST PLATTER...served all day:)   The restaurant is small and intimate, but good for a family meal and the staff are great folks who really try to make you feel welcome. There's ample parking across the street in a common lot and the prices are really reasonable. They are mostly a breakfast/lunch place, closing at 4 pm most days, and 2 pm on Sunday, but I have heard tell that soon, they will be doing delivery within a 3 mile radius, so order in!   So, if you're in Cleveland Heights, stop by the Greedy Girl (cause they're most generous with good food and great service:)"}
{"text":"Spent 50 minute waiting for  Gyro.  The server mixed up the orders - brought a Frankie instead of a gyro.  Then said it would be another 20 minutes to cook another gyro.  No apologies even.     Price to serving size ratio is very high.  Very stuffy with no ventilation.    Would never ever come here again.  Cancelled the order and walked out.   Terrible experience that completely spoiled a nice Sunday pm."}
{"text":"I finally went to GREEDY GIRL for lunch today, after reading about it several months ago.  I wanted to see what this place with such an odd name was about.  And it was a good thing I did!  Upon entering the intimate cafe, it was a little confusing at first, but it got easier quickly.  There are a number of tempting sounding dishes on the menu and I changed my decision a few times, but finally ordering the Bombay Chicken Salad sandwich, which proved to be a fine choice!  It was served on a pita-looking wrap, but it was better-tasting than the usual pita.  Nice homemade texture and complemented the chicken filling.  Very tasty with a hint previously unknown spices.  It was accompanied by a sliced potato side dish that was also spiced creatively, but gently. Nice touch!  I talked to the owner and her friends just as I was leaving.  She was a proud host, a wonderful chef and an interesting conversationalist..  She made me feel welcomed and glad to be a customer.  I will go back to try some of the other intriguing items on the menu.  It made me think there are many more new tastes waiting to me to experience."}
{"text":"A nice little place that seats around 15 with not-so-great parking accommodations. The food has been great on both occasions, BUT the blonde waitress/cashier with the glasses has had a consistent unwarranted issue which seems to be only with me both times. That is why I cannot give this restaurant the 4 stars that it deserves.  During my first visit, a month ago in October, I encountered the waitress after walking into an empty shop. After being in there less than 10 seconds, she asked me, \"What would you like?\" It wasn't so much the words, but it was the tone and the fact that I haven't been in the shop, 1. Long enough to make it to the front counter, 2. Read what's on the menu to request an order. Because it was my first time, I had a few questions with what was on the menu. Every answer I received was dry and very short. I took it as, maybe that's just her personality, so I place my order and took a seat. Less than 2 minutes later an older European couple and a friend came into the shop. I noticed the waitress' demeanor change, because the new patrons were greeted warmly with a big smile and a, \"Welcome to Greedy Girls! How are you today?\" After the patrons response the waitress said, \"Just let me know when you're ready to order.\" As she stood erect and attentive behind the counter rather than sitting at the side table behind her laptop as she was during our exchange.  After my experience, I chose not to spend energy on what could be conceived as a negative first impression, taking into consideration that she might have had a bad day or may have other issues not seen on the surface. Because of that, I let the situation rest.  I decided to return today, November 30th, 2017 to try other items on the menu. Upon entering, I was greeted with a similar, dry, \"What would you like?\" During our encounter, a cook peers from out the kitchen and greets me with a welcoming smile and hello, which immediately puts a smile on my face. A short time later I decided on the lamb burger sliders. The waitress informs me that they are all out of the Greek sliders and the Indian sliders are all they have left. I asked what was the difference between the Greek and the Indian sliders. In an awkward exchange she says, \"One is Greek and one is Indian\" While was given in a short condescending tone. I look at her.... She then goes on to explain different ingredients between the two. I opted for the Greek 'wings' instead.  After the order was ready she comes to the front with the container and asks, \"Do you want a plastic bag?\" As I stand and walk to the counter, I say, \"Yes\". I then politely ask for napkins. The waitress says, \"They're on the table\" Taken back, I turn around and look at the table I was just sitting where I see a napkin holder. I thought, \"That is extremely rude!\" I then walk to the counter to receive my 'now' bagged food, only to see 3 packs of napkins directly behind her head within 10 inches reaching distance. I ask, \"Aren't those napkins right there?\" She turns around to look at them and says, \"Yes.\" I ask, \"So, you couldn't grab a few napkins from there to put in my bag?\" She then goes on to repeat, \"There's napkins on the table\". So, I took my bag and I left, receiving subpar customer service and no napkins.  Greedy Girl's food is good, but not worth the hassle if other patrons are being treated as 'well' as I was from my two visits."}
{"text":"Great homemade food, good portions. I ordered a gyro sandwich. It was the best I've ever had (and I've eaten many a gyro in the past 30 so years) It's homemade! Yes! First time I've had a Gyro that didn't taste like all others. Way to go!  Went back for breakfast; a waffle for my wife and french toast for myself. A bit underwhelming unfortunately for the price. The filling and center of the French toast was undercooked and not warm. The waffle was good and syrup was tasty. I wish, for the price, these would have come with a side. I hope they can balance their pricing and menu."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me once she learned of this situation. She showed great integrity by calling me personally, and wanting to set things right. As I have pointed out before, the food here is great! I hope this episode will result in check points being placed so that everyone has an easier time ordering online. I will be visiting/ordering from them again in the future!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food.  Greek & Indian \"street food\"...home coojed and delicious.  We've been here 4 or 5 times & I've tried something new each time.  Never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Have been passing this place since it opened and hadn't taken advantage of the opportunity to try the food until today. Had the Frankie with chicken which was phenomenal. Perfectly done. Service was very fast. I was in and out in less than 10-15 minutes. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was very kind. This is an excellent and welcome addition to the neighborhood and I would encourage people to try it. This is the kind of place that you want to stay open as long as possible. I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Delicious, up-n-coming spot in Cleveland Heights offering Greek & Indian plates. But this Greedy Gal isn't so much about fusion as she is about variety. With modern takes on classics from both cuisines, Greedy keeps her eats fresh, flavorful, & always made-to-order.   I'm a Cleveland native, so I know that Greedy is the first of her kind. Few other restaurants have wed diversity, freshness, & flavor so seamlessly. Must try: okra fries, baklava waffle, Parsi omelette!   This spot is great for brunch, lunch, or early din-din. Only critique: wish they were open later!   Friendly service & food that you know is always made fresh, sans freezer. What could be better? Missing this gem already & will definitely visit again when back in the CLE."}
{"text":"Good food. Great coffee (they use Soltice Brewers). Good service, fair prices. Great music selections!"}
{"text":"This Indian/Greek fusion spot is absolutely fantastic! We stopped in for lunch and had a few different dishes including a chicken salad wrap and a vegetarian masala dosa (Fry Girl).  Both were cooked and served up fresh and delicious with a side a sliced potatoes.  We had some baklava for desert that was just perfect.  (Served with a clove in each small bite sized piece). Counter service for order and a few spots to sit and enjoy this fusion of food.  The variety on the menu is impressive and we will definitely be back.  The baklava waffle sounds fabulous as well as many other menu choices.  This is a must visit spot for anyone who enjoys a unique place that is clean, fresh, and delicious.  Go try it!  Went back again today and had the Frankie.  Just a perfect lunch and being able to sit outside and enjoy a beautiful day and a delicious meal was what the doctor ordered.  Make sure you go back and try other items on the menu.  It is going to take a bit, but so far it has been 5 stars on all choices."}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on other reviews and definitely wish them well. Our food was all way over salted and overall just average.  Judge for yourself. . . I would definitely ask for minimal salt though."}
{"text":"We stop here for quick lunch. Very interesting menu combinations of Indian, Greek and American. Place was cheerful service quick. My wife really liked spanakopita, samosas were Ok. Chicken chalo khaate hain (#7) was ok, interesting flavors"}
{"text":"Awesome gyro. Home made as she makes  her own gyro loaf.  Great owner who took care of me after closing. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. Pay attention to hours. Breakfast and lunch place. Also squeaky clean."}
{"text":"Amazing! Try the Frankie and the Lamb stuffed grape leaves."}
{"text":"First time though I've been wanting to try for awhile. I am SO happy I finally did. OMG. So good. Friendly people and very very fresh reasonably priced and so tasty! I ordered the Frankie vegetarian style (no chicken added paneer) by the recommendation of the friendly lady that works there. It was more than I hoped for. I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I finally stopped in after discovering greedy girl a few weeks ago and asked ourselves why it took so long. Greedy girl is amazing with healthy options and perfect Indian spices, it's a win and New favorite of ours. If you like Indian food, make a serious effort to try greedy girl, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I've picked up carryout twice and tried 6 or 7 menu items between the two.  All were good, some were exceptional."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Flavors were great in everything we tried. Slightly off on side portion size. (Very few potatoes come with the omelet for the price) But we will never return, unfortunately. Not accommodating to families with children. No child seats, or boosters means someone is forced to try to eat their food while holding a squirmy baby with no relief. Which actually wasn't that hard since the food doesn't come out even close to at the same time as the other orders at your table. The place was 90+ degrees and unbearable to sit in even though it's a cool 70 ish day out. Great for single couples or ordering out!"}
{"text":"Greedy Girl can be summed up as Quirky!  I finally managed to get to try it for lunch as it only open Wednesday to Sundays for breakfast and lunch, quirky.  Located on Taylor Road between Mr. Brisket and Irv's Sandwiches, quirky.  Parking is on the street in front or somewhere nearby, quirky.  Walking in you find a very brightly painted room, funky decor such as giant fork and knife, quirky.   You place your order at the counter at the back and sit down, with the food brought out to you.   Unfortunately the gentleman at the counter was new and really had trouble helping with the menu; including that he kept suggesting dishes with meat in them, even though I repeatedly told him I didn't eat meat; he was very friendly, just not helpful.  The menu is a unique mix of Greek and Indian food, quirky.   I ended up getting the Frankie sandwich with paneer and a side of raita salad.  I also got a free cookie for paying with cash.  The food came out in about 10 minutes and it was interesting.  The egg dipped bread was wonderful, what you would want every pita type of bread to be, the portion of paneer (firm cheese) was large and overwhelmed the rest of the sandwich; the curry sauce and chopped onion and cilantro were delicious, but I wanted to have more of these flavors.  The raita salad was a small portion of finely diced cucumbers and tomatoes in a mild yogurt sauce.   The homemade cookie was a large mound of chocolate with coconut, sweet and tasty; delicious and quirky.  While I think that Greedy Girl has huge potential and reflects a unique approach to running a small restaurant, I think they need to keep improving; service needs to get more knowledgeable and while the flavors are good I think they need to figure out how to maximize the flavor.  Overall the food is good, but a bit expensive for what you get.  Dinner hours would certainly be welcome so more people can get to try this quirky spot."}
{"text":"This place is really good Greek food! I wasn't sure what to expect because it's a little pricey compared to other fast casual. However make no mistake it's authentic and made to order. The only thing I wouldn't recommend are the lamb sliders - Flavor is good but portion size is not worth the price point."}
{"text":"A lovely place with DELICIOUS food. What a fun a menu and such a variety of choices. I was lucky enough to spark up a conversation with the owner of the restaurant and could tell right away that she puts her heart into running the place. We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"My gyro was over cooked and the fries/potatoes slices should've been fried longer. I was disappointed in the amount of meat served for the price paid."}
{"text":"We got takeout - the Belgian waffle was perfect and so fun, and the tofu Frankie was pretty good! The tofu was cooked well, but it could have had been more flavorful. The sauce made it great, kind of saved it. I will definitely be coming back here. It's inventive and unique. Vegetarian friendly gives it high marks!!"}
{"text":"Greedy girl is a rockin place. I'm so glad they decided to settle in Cleveland heights.   When it comes to Greek food. Hand me a Gyro with T sauce and I'm good. I'm a bit obsessed with the Greek Hot dog.   The restaurant itself was smile and quiet, you couldn't really ask for more. The staff was so nice and very assurtuve and were there when we needed something.   If you're an eater and like Greek food, or food that may be \"different\" then what you're used too. I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just enough for lunch! Sali Boti, 9, a Parsi dish,is mild but a delightful sweet sour taste that can be spiced up to your liking! Friends raving aboutFry Girl,13, and Frankie, 7. Served with a choice of dressings, just darned good!"}
{"text":"I had to redo this review- because after not receiving two items (which happened to be no fault of their own), the owner called me and offered to personally deliver those said items! Amazing customer service! **Do yourself a favor and get the Greek lamb sliders- your mouth will thank you!**"}
{"text":"I love Greek cuisine but this review is mostly about Greedy Girl's Indian aka Parsi/Bombay offerings.  Greedy Girl offers omelettes, sandwiches, gyros and sides from 6:30am - 3pm and waffles and french toast until 11am. The menu is large and most items can be requested vegetarian or vegan.  This is the only restaurant in Cleveland with Parsi cuisine on its menu and it's the real deal.  So, what is Parsi cuisine? Wiki here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsi_cuisine  For anyone born and brought up in Bombay, Parsi cuisine is pure nostalgia...buttered brun bread (like that perfect baguette - crisp, thin crust, airy crumb)  shared with friends over cups of tea, chicken puffs and masala omelettes wolfed down before an evening showing of the latest blockbuster, standing in line for berry pulao, a Duke's Raspberry... I could go on...for a long time.  In addition to the Parsi omelette and salli boti, Greedy Girl puts two other much ignored Bombay street foods - the Frankie (a sandwich/wrap made of a paratha, egg, and chicken with onions and spices) and the Bombay sandwich (a grilled/panini veggie sandwich) - on its roster in addition to chaats, samosas and sides. On our two visits in as many days, we tried the Parsi omelette, chicken and paneer frankies, spanakopita and gyro. GG's frankie is the correct combination of flavor and textures - a paratha that's crisp on the outside with soft egg on the inside, wrapped around moist, tender chicken with a perfectly spiced sauce. The only thing missing is the Tibbs (the inventor of the Frankie)super secret zing - a spicy, tangy taste profile that no one has been able to crack. The Parsi omelette consists of an egg batter with onions, cilantro and spices folded in. It's delicious. The spanakopita had a shattering crisp, buttery shell with a filling heavy on spinach ie just the way I like it! The gyro was very flavorful with plenty of meat and pita that was soft without being doughy or overly thick.  Greedy Girl is Eust Kavouras' labor of love. She's living her dream, cooking up fantastic Greek and Bombay (it IS a cuisine - believe me!) food. Wander over to Greedy Girl and try a cuisine that's hard to find outside of Bombay. Maybe you'll get to chat with Eust and her 93 year old Parsi food guru and experience the passion that led to this little gem. At the very least, you'll 'travel' to Bombay or Greece for under $10."}
{"text":"My son and visited Greedy Girl for brunch while visiting from out of town. We shared the Greek omelet,  the Indian omelet and the baklava waffle. We liked them all but agreed that the Indian omelet was the best. I've never had anything like it. The experience is cafeteria style,  so you order at the counter,  pick up your utensils at a table, and serve your own water. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Just open a couple weeks ago, not everything on the menu is available right now. We order Frankie sandwich, bhel puri, okra fries, Parsi omelet. The owner is Greek but she loved the Indian cuisine. This is her first restaurant endeavor and appreciates suggestions from customers greatly.  She made everything from fresh. The menu is quite ambitious so a lot ingredients for most of the dishes aren't even in stock yet.  As a restaurant offers two cuisines street-food styles, I'd say it's done pretty well. I'd return.  I'd be very interested in trying desserts next time. Baklava, malai kulfi to name a few.  They are right next to Mr Brisket. Park on the street or from across street at the family dollars."}
{"text":"A while back I was having a bad day, and came into Greedy Girl e-x-c-i-t-e-d. This place has been at the top of my list for a long time. I'm so torn on writing this review. I'm not hard to please. Just get my order right and be nice to me and I'm yours forever (you don't even need to tell me I'm pretty).  Greedy Girl is a small joint. It maybe fits about 10 people. When I visited, it was pretty full, but there was a seat or two left (size has no effect on my review, I actually like small places). When I was ordering at the register, I had a pretty awkward social exchange with the gal taking my order (she didn't seem thrilled to help me, and every time I tried to pronounce something Greek on the menu, I got judge-y vibes. Side note, I'm German, not Greek. Doing my best here). I didn't want to stress them out by adding one more person to a table, so I decided just to get my food to go.  I ordered the house gyro, a pastry and a side of the Greek fries. My food came out in under 15 minutes, which was nice. The interior also has a cute vibe, so I didn't mind waiting. I got home and untied my tightly wound bag of lunch. They didn't give me my pastry though I was charged for it. Talk about more sadness on a bad day, especially when I told the gal how excited I specifically was for that little pastry of Greek goodness. I was also super pumped for the gyro because the menu said it had house made tzatziki. When I looked in my gyro, it had the smallest dollop on it. Maybe you need to ask for it extra, and it's not included? Be sure to confirm that's coming on it. For me, sauce really makes the gyro, because otherwise it's really just meat.  So you can see, I'm torn. I think the food could be really, really good if you order the right thing and they get your order correct. I'm willing to come back again if I'm in the area and update this review later, but I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"I'm still eating here as I'm writing this, but it's so good I had to review it. Awesome food! Delicious!! Great vegan options! Meat eating wife is happy too!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious menu!  Fantastic choices !  We loved the okra fries! We loved the Lamb ! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing lunch at Greedy Girl. The four of us sampled a bit of everything from the Frankie (delicious) to the Dolmades (wonderful) to the Pastitsio Meatballs (incredible). It's a wonderful space to spend time with friends and family and the food was fantastic. The Bhel Puri was everyone's favorite - just a very unique and delightful snack to get us warmed up before the entrees arrived. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when i heard about this place.  They didn't let me down.  The food was amazing! The Greek wings were really good, food didn't take long to come out. Ingredients were healthy and I was full for almost the entire work day. Definitely plan on going back and taking friends."}
{"text":"Whether your mild or wild this is a great place! I tried the Bombay Bhel Puri and the Vegan omelet. Both were delicious and great value for money. Friendly staff and relaxing environment. If you have any vegans or vegetarians in your group they won't feel left out. This place is great for a date or just popping in to relax alone. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was an ok experience. We went there around 2:30, and it wasn't super crowded, but it got gradually more crowded as we were there. I ordered the vegan omelette and the coconut cauliflower. We sat down, and it took about an hour to get our food which I think is very long especially for a place that is supposed to be a quick lunch place. The food was ok, but the potatoes that came on the side were very good and so were the vegan cookies. I don't know if i would recommend coming here, they were very slow and the food wasn't amazing for as long as I had to wait."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back here. All of the food was amazing, the seating area is cute and perfect for intimate conversations. This restaurant is the epitome of Clevelands food scene and it can't get any better."}
{"text":"The person who used \"quirky\" several times to review this restaurant is out of touch....or maybe just quirky! The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the staff is welcoming and the food is fabulous. Each dish is prepared by cooks who clearly love what they do and the spices and flavors literally transport you to places you've never been. Every dish I have tried has been superb, and I highly recommend everyone get there at least once. Greedy Girl is a refreshing and welcomed addition to the local food scene!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. Greek and Indian cuisine with a street flare... very reasonable prices with great customer service..."}
{"text":"Had the marriage special. The chicken and waffle were excellent. The side of carrots and potatoes were my favorite part. I want to go back and try more off of the menu. The hours are a bit odd."}
{"text":"The menu and recipes are imaginative. The ingredients were fresh and the dishes well prepared. I had the lamb kebab which was good. I tasted my wife's gyro which was excellent. I will go back."}
{"text":"I have been here only once as I was looking for a twist to the standard Indian food we get in the Cleveland area. Loved the place and the food . I customized the Sali boti into a vegetarian dish with paneer and it was yummy . The okra fries were very nice as well and so was the corn appetizer . The husband had the dosa and it too was good . The owner is super friendly and she came by to talk to us . She is the one who suggested I try the sali boti . Since we were the last customers of the day , we also got a puff and some spanakopita to carry home .. all in all , loved the place ..  I have to return to try the bfast items soon .."}
{"text":"I think I have developed a mild obsession with their Greek omelette. It is quite possibly one of the best meals I have ever eaten. This is a small operation, so you may have to wait a little for service, as much of the staff is working both the front and back of the house. I've also had the mango lassi and okra fries. Both were delicious. I've also enjoyed the baklava waffle with their in house cinnamon syrup. The food is very fresh and delicious, and this place has quickly become a regular in my rotation of dining options. I highly recommend checking Greedy Girl out."}
{"text":"Greedy Girl is such a great addition to the Cleveland Heights food scene! It fills a need for flavorful, affordable breakfast and lunch fare that is healthful and relatively quick. My husband and I have made three recent trips for quick weekend lunches and have come away smiling and satisfied on each occasion. Menu standouts (so far) include the Fry Girl (potato masala folded into a rice crepe with cheese - absolute comfort food!) and the Frankie. I have also sampled the Alpha to Omega omelette, which was also very good (worth trying for the fried potatoes alone!). I'd recommend Greedy Girl to anyone for a quick, tasty meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING!!! My husband and I came in for breakfast and tried the Alpha Omega omelette and the baklava waffle. The food was ready in less than 10 minutes. The flavors of the omelette were bursting in every bite. This is one of the best omelettes I have ever eaten. Plus, the potatoes are quite tasty too. The baklava waffle was delicious. I can't wait to come here for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Delicious addition to the neighborhood.  Very casual, service takes a few minutes though.  It's made fresh.  Wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Love this place and they do Uber eats. Omelets are to die for. Quick and decent price"}
{"text":"My best friend and I have had our eye on this place for quite sometime now. We finally made it there with her new born. We were under the impressing this was going to be a Greek and Indian fusion, which it is not. There are separate Greek and Indian items on the menu. And happy to say everything we got was fantastic! We would be definitely coming especially because of the vey friendly and kind owner of the restaurant."}
