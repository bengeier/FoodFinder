{"text":"Fresh tortillas make the great tacos outstanding I've been twice and I haven't tried anything but the tacos they are that good maybe one day I'll try something else"}
{"text":"Food is good only thing I ordered super nachos and I asked for pico de Gallo and they didn't put any"}
{"text":"Brand new hidden Gem! Just opened February 2018.
They have very delicious food and the prices are a deal. They take cash and debit. They don't currently deliver. The wait time is not so long. Can't wait to see them grow!"}
{"text":"What's the point in having a special requests section if your not going to follow the special request. What's so hard about not throwing lettuce and guacamole on the plate. People order without guacamole because they may be allergic. Ever think of that. Well I guess is back to Robertos. It's funny too...most of those guys don't speak English and the still get it right everytime. Step it up habaneros."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a couple times and finally decided to go in and I'm glad I did because the food was amazing as well as the prices, I ordered the taco combo special which comes with 4tacos and a small drink for $5 FYI it's 1 asada 1 chicken 1 carnitas and 1 al pastor taco I ain't gonna lie I enjoyed all 4 tacos lol , I love the meat they use for the asada tacos I also ordered a asada torta which was bomb and filling... I got a good vibe from this place the cook reminded me of my cousin who passed away a couple yrs ago who also was cook/owner of his own Mexican food restaurant in Northern California.... Definitely will be coming back....."}
{"text":"Im rating this place 3 1/2 stars, my bf and I were craving carne asada fries so we decided to give this place a try after looking at their reviews. We ended up getting a torta to share and the fries. The food overall was good, the meat had a good taste. Only complaint is that the fries needed more cheese but I'm sure you can order extra cheese or ask for the nacho cheese. 

One more thing I would suggest is having a salsa bar so guests can help themselves to different salsas like most taquerias have. They only gave us 2 little containers and it seemed like they only had one type."}
{"text":"Decent food. But to be called \"Habanero grill\" and your spiciest salsa is weaker than robertos red salsa? Maybe change your name to \"Bell Pepper Grill\""}
{"text":"Food was really delicious. Ordered carne asada nachos and the meat was really tender and juicy. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good food, got the 4 tacos special. Service is great too. Think I'd have this than Roberto's."}
{"text":"Super bomb, fresh, ordered the (perfectly grilled) chicken taco perron (something like that) & the salsa is sooo good."}
{"text":"Love the taco special 1 azada 1 chicken 1 pastor 1 carnitas plus a drink delicious for sure I'm coming back"}
