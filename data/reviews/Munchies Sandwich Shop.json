{"text":"New owner, same food..... Latest visit resulted in a few surprises. They now charge for water. Small cup of water at that. My wife likes ranch dressing to eat with her fries and they now charge for that. I ate catsup on mine and I watched out to make sure the waitress wasn't counting my squirts. I overheard a guy pickup a fish order and he had to pay for tarter sauce.  Wow! What is next? Maybe pay for straws and napkins?

Has closed a few months ago!"}
{"text":"Cute, super casual place. I never would have found them without the Restaurant.com gc. Service was good. The burger wasn't bad, although the patty was fairly thin, and the bun was oddly crumbly. The tater tots were a nice option, and there did appear to be a decent selection, with fair prices. I'd visit again, when in the area, but definitely not go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch with the locals...love the cheeseburger melt and the lotta burger is good as well! Get the tater tots for a little lunchroom flashback and check out the reasonable portions offered on the daily specials! Friendly, prompt service...can't wait to come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Burger I had was terrible.  The bun literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up.  Ground beef was thin and tasteless.  Won't go back - sorry."}
