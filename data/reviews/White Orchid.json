{"text":"Don't order Tung yum Kung soup (very bad)! Curry chicken (chicken seem over a months),they say ??? is the best in Toronto but nothing special.steam fish cake was cold and reheat at microwave in mins! Over all I won't come again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just as delicious as when it was called Delicious.  Of course, it's the same chef so we are not surprised when we visited tonight that the food is still delicious.  The chef just applied his expertise to a different style of food but really, he still kept most of the \"old\" dishes.  The HaiNan chicken is still the best in the GTA and I've tried many restaurants' chicken made in a similar style even though they may be called another name.  This is not just a Malaysian Singaporean restaurant, it's a regular Chinese restaurant with a SE Asian twist.   The Fukien food is still there but there is now more variety in the menu.  We made a point of trying something on the new menu in addition to the HaiNan chicken.  The roti and curry chicken is superb!  Never tasted such crisp and light roti.  We also tried the Pad Thai - perfectly done al dente and not sugary sweet as in some other restaurants.  The owner mentioned it was tough reopening after a month of renovations so it is possible people who visited that opening week may not be seeing it at its best.    I would recommend trying them again.  The decor is definitely outstanding.  I agreed with another reviewer who described it as having a downtown feel uptown.  Entrees are actually cheaper than a chain like Spring Roll and tasted much better.  For photos and more comments, visit my blog at http://foodsparks.blogspot.ca/2013/09/still-delicious.html"}
{"text":"Half the restaurant was empty at 6pm and they did not want to serve us, came up with an excuse of all tables are reserved!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the lunch specials. The shrimp paste pork fried rice (#15) is amazing! The crispy tofu is also done superbly well! The curries are also quite tasty. All in all, a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Food is good but not great.  Portions are just too small.  We ordered the wasbi mayo shrimps hoping it will be spicy (as indicated on the menu) but it was more mayo than wasibi in it.  And for $12, we only got 10 pieces.  Size of each shrimp was like the size of a loonie, which was fitting for the price of dish.   The balachan seafood fried rice was good.  Fried very well and had a pretty decent amount of seafood in it.  The only problem was, it was not spicy at all.   The other dish we got was the sweet and spicy pork chop.  This dish was again, more sweet than spicy and the amount of chops you get, is equivalent to 2 pieces only.   Coming in to this place,  we should have ordered roti with curry as many people have suggested that it is what this restaurant is known for.  But for some reason, when the curry dishes came out to other tables, i was not able to smell the curry or the roti.    Oh well,  maybe it was our fault for not ordering their signature dishes.  I was just not tempted to eat it i guess.   Will i come back... unlikely.  There is a good Malaysian place near Midland and McNicoll where i know i can smell the curry and the fresh roti."}
{"text":"Food's portion is small which in terms make it more expensive than it should be. The selection from the menu wasn't extensive and a number of things were sold out (we went at around 7:30 - 8pm, prime dinner time). The crispy tofu was made EXACTLY like the ones you'd see in any karaoke - which wasn't a good sign. The other ones weren't memorable at all and I honestly can't recall something that stood out.  The service was really strange - even though they were somewhat courteous. When we arrived, the place was full (it was a tiny place), that's fine - but the waitress promptly told us \"sorry, we're full\". Without any indication that we'd need to wait or how long it'd be, it felt like she just wanted to send us away. We decided to just stand there until one of the tables finally left - when we were seated there was another elderly couple who came after us and received the same treatment so they just left. The waitress also assumed that we didn't need any change and just hung us out to dry after collecting the bill, we had to actually asked for it. It was a very odd experience."}
{"text":"Authentic and super tasty Malaysian food. Owner is super nice and offered curry sauce for dipping free of charge. Excellent service and price is reasonable. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves south Asian food!"}
{"text":"Just visited this new restaurant on Highway 7 East.  The place has gone through a major makeover and everything is fresh and pleasant. The menu has changed and now they are serving Thai/ Malay/ Singaporean food. The atmosphere is welcoming and quite chic. As the other review mentioned, it is a different variation compared to the other restaurants in the neighbourhood.  We tried quite a few dishes there and I would say they were all well prepared. The fish otah (a fish mousse steamed in banana leaf) was delicious, shrimp chips and calamari were well seasoned, (the peanut dipping sauce for the chips was outstanding!) and the satay platter was good, each skewer was perfect, not dry and overcooked like some other places we tried.  Also had the yellow curry with chicken and roti, and for carbs the pineapple fried rice was great. We were so full at the end but still managed to try the coconut milk sago, and that was something we would definitely go back for again.  When we were there the place was packed, but the kitchen was quite efficient and it didn't take long for our order to be prepared and served. Service was good and we will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"The place is pretty small and understaffed. My friend finished dish came first. My yang zhou fried rice came when my friend finished his lunch. The yang zhou fried rice was pretty salty. Some parts of the rice was extremely salty. The rice was not mixed in well. Pretty disappointed at the experience."}
{"text":"Hainan Chicken was really good. Laksa noodles fulfilled my expectations.  Hoping to return soon to try out the roti and curry!"}
{"text":"Neighbourhood gem. Finally something different in the area. The offer Malaysian, Singaporean and southern Chinese taste. Feels very homey here and excellent customer service. Loved every dishes we ordered so far. They also offer private menu. Good for small groups."}
{"text":"SUPER friendly staff, SUPER yummy food and VERY reasonably priced. We had lunch on a Friday in late October and both ordered the laksa soup. Spicy with the right amount of heat. Hit the spot on a cold day. Ordered the coconut sago for dessert, which was perfectly portioned after the large laksa soup. Would DEFINITELY return and would HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I love all the food I have tried there. Excellent service. Highly recommend if you love South Asian food. They also made very good Chinese New Year cake ???????????????????"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try this new place after seeing it after yoga.    Food was tasty, being a curry fan I went straight for their green curry chicken with coconut rice.  Had just the right amount of heat and the chicken was tender and more than enough!   Crispy tofu and a satay platter started us off which was a nice start to our spicy meal!!!  Service was great, even got a free mango sticky rice! (grand opening special???, not sure)  It's good to finally have an alternative for Malaysian/Singapore food in RH/Markham area.  I found it priced well especially for the size and quality of the dishes.  The space is a fresh change to other restaurants in the area, a downtown feel north of Hwy #7."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again.  After 15 mins wait for the table then tell you the table was reserved by someone.  Very unorganized."}
{"text":"I had a chance to try this new restaurant on Sunday night with my family. It was very busy given it's still in its 10% off grand opening promotion. There were about 10 to 12 tables packed in a small place. Three of us had to wait at door for 30 mins in order to get a table.   Decor was modern and bright. Service was pretty good. The chef/owner came out to greet customers which was very nice. Food was quite tasty but dishes were small and expensive. (acceptable with the 10% off)  We had the beef satay skewers (4 pcs), roti with curry beef, 1/2 Hainan chicken with \"chicken oil\" rice, and stir-fried veggies with belachan (??????).   Out of the four dishes, we liked the stir-fried veggies the most. It was extremely flavorful but unfortunately the dish was ridiculously small for $11. The roti was crispy and fluffy, but a little bit on the oily side; the small bowl of curry beef had strong herbs but not enough spiciness. Hainan chicken was alright, but this version had the chicken bones intact. It also didn't come with the traditional \"black soy sauce\" for condiment. I've tried this same dish many times at other places in Toronto and in Singapore, and they had the chicken bones removed.   So far I think it's a good start for this tiny restaurant. Not all dishes were done in a traditional way. We didn't seem to taste too much MSG in the food. If they could sort out problems here and there and make the dishes a bit larger, they should do okay.   I still enjoy Restoran Malaysian better than White Orchid, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try some time later either."}
{"text":"Lots of hype coming into this place as serving legit Hainan chicken rice but sadly it was just okay in my books. I definitely had better. These days I expect the chicken to be deboned and expect a strong chicken flavor and I got neither of those eating here. The rice though I'll give them credit was pretty good and well flavored. I looked at the portion for a personal Hainan chicken rice and it was too small so I opted to order half a chicken instead. Honestly there wasn't that much meat and lots of bones. I'm very selective with my Hainan chicken rice and this definitely doesn't go down as a place I would eat for it. I've eaten so many Hainan chicken rice that this place doesn't go in my book of places I would recommend to eat Hainan chicken rice. Maybe their other dishes are better but I wouldn't come here for their Hainan chicken rice."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was really great - very friendly. This is going to be a restaurant that I frequent! I had the curry laksa - so good! Very satisfied"}
{"text":"Was on a quest to find Singapore-style Hokkien Mee (the \"white sauce\" version, not the Malaysian version with dark soy sauce). My heart leapt when I saw not one but two Hokkien noodle dishes on their menu!  Tried both the Hokkien noodle dishes and alas, both were not what I expected. Gingerly asked the lady at cash (owner?) why they would have 2 dishes that didn't resemble the real thing from Singapore, and learned the chef was not Singaporean. He had lived in Singapore for a few years but his Hokkien noodle dishes were closer to the versions made in the Fujian province of China. (I cannot verify this since I haven't been there.)  Guess I shouldn't have jumped to the conclusion that White Orchid has a Singaporean chef. After all, the national flower of Singapore is Vanda Miss Joaquim, a Purple Orchid.   Went back a third time to try the Singapore Chicken Rice. Chicken had good flavour, rice was fragrant. Should have asked for more chilli and ginger-scallion mix in my takeout box.   Overall, this place has friendly service, decent food and clean washrooms. I would return to try a few more items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken rice dish in town. I've never had tastier flavored rice than at this restaurant! So authentic and delicious. I always figured that I'd have to travel to Asia to get the best Chicken and rice dish but I've finally found a place that makes it just like at home!"}
{"text":"The third time returning to this private kitchen. The first two times we were awed by the dishes and creativity, however, tonight, we were a bit disappointed. The double boiled soup and Hakka style braised pork belly exceeded expectation. To our disappointment, the crab and rice bowl was subpar, the crab was overdone to the extent that the meat was tough and rice lost its chew!    The sweet and sour fish was one of their signature dish but it was too sweet and lost its sour balance.  The fish was over done. Compared with Peking Garden or Suzhou Chekiang in Hong Kong, this dish was subpar in its taste, presentation and quality.   The desserts were a hit and miss. We came here to celebrate birthday with our friends and the Chinese birthday buns were complimentary.  However, with the first bite, one could tell they were not home made and the flour dough were not freshly made.  The traditional glutinous balls in sweet soup transformed into a fusion version with strawberries, eggdrop and cantaloupe.  It turned into a neither here nor there type of dessert, soup base was too sweet and the strawberries were too sour.   It was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Hainan chicken is not real Hainan chicken , not the one i thought...it should be no bone w/Hainan Chicken.  Half chicken with bone $15.50 + tax =17.82 , but it tastes same as White cut chicken(???) from T&T , over price for half chicken.won't come back next time!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here fairly often. I would recommend getting their Malay curry or their laksa. Not a bad place overall."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Singaporean chicken rice. The rice is better than your average rice at Chinese restaurants. The chicken they source are free range chicken. The way they prepare is in line with traditional Hainan/Singapore chicken in Singapore which ironically cannot be going there now. They usually sell out around 1:30 pm on weekends so come early. Their fried congee with peanuts is also unique and a perfect blend of soft with hard, crunchy and gooey. Their taro 'Sam's dessert is one to die for if you like taro. It is not made with lard like other places yet it is smooth and not too oily."}
{"text":"I don't think I have tasted pork bone soup like theirs before. I ordered it with noodles inside and I would order just the soup alone next time. There is a bit of underlying heat to the soup which is very nice.  I also tried the Haianese chicken. I love the 3 sauces, the flavored rice and the soup that accompany the chicken. While the chicken has good flavor and the meat has a nice texture (I can tell the chicken is the free-run type), I don't particularly like the skin so there were quite a bit on the plate where it's mostly skin and very little meat. I can see they're trying to provide a variety whereas I like white meat most.  I would definitely return here for future meals."}
{"text":"Got denied service for no reason. Walked in it was full. Five minutes in nobody asked if we wanted a table and for how many. When we straight up told the owner we wanted a table for four they said they wouldn't be serving us. Don't go there, this business doesn't deserve to thrive."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with family for the first time. The owner/chef has a cooking show on Roger's Omni Mandarin channel.  The restaurant is very small but clean. Service is good.  Food are good too.  See my photos with description and rating.    Overall I give it a four stars rating.   Downside is it is too crowd.  Will I come back again?  Probably not, not because of food but seating is very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Passed by this place and was attracted by the sign on the window -\"New dish on menu: DEEP FRIED CONGEE\".   Deep fried congee?!  How???  But they did!!  The deep fried congee appeared before our eyes in ten minutes.  On the plate stacked four crispy golden brown balls, and with pickled turnips on the side.  The congee was cooked down until all the water had been absorbed.  They were mixed with green onion and peanuts, and wrapped around by the light and crispy batter. Beautiful color and with great flavor.  Great appetizer!  We had the curry beef brisket with roti as well.  Beef brisket was tender; roti was soft and fluffy.  Good service!"}
{"text":"White Orchid falls into the category of \"I really want to like it, but.....\"  We ordered a dinner combo for 2.  It came with satay appetizers (eggrolls, satay chicken and Thai fish cake), sweet and sour fish, curry beef brisket with 3 pieces of roti, boiled vegetable with oyster sauce and dessert.  This would be a good sampling of Malaysian staples.  Out of them, the curry was quite flavourful and creamy, but the beef brisket was tougher than desired.  If I could get this curry with lamb or chicken, I would be quite contented.  The boiled vegetable with oyster sauce was home styled, which was okay.  The fish fillets in the sweet and sour fish were too thin, so I was eating chewy dough more the meat.  The satay appetizers were so bland that all the taste came from the dipping sauces.    Services were okay.  Food arrived promptly.  Decoration was very nice.  At this point, I don't evaluate whether White Orchid offers authentic SE Asian cooking or not.  For tasty food, only the curry was good this evening.  I think I would return to try other offerings, such as chicken rice and basil noodle.  Hopefully, the rice and noodles are better."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for White Orchid coming in, because the restaurant seems to be pretty packed every time I come by the plaza. However, I left disappointed because the food wasn't particularly memorable.   Environment: The plaza is right on the Highway 7 to ample of parking space at the back, I would say it's fairly convenient to locate.  The interior of the restaurant is really well decorated, almost too fancy and upscale looking for the food they serve at the $11-30/person price point. As I said before, the restaurant is quite small so it's better to come in a group of 4 or fewer, though they do have 2 larger round tables to fit more people, those are usually taken and possibly by reservation only.   Food: We ordered the Pork Rib Soup Noodle and Malaysian Coconut Rice. The noodle wasn't very good because there was only ribs accompanying the noodle, no other side toppings such as veggies. The vermicelli was too hard as well, seems like they didn't cook it thoroughly. For the coconut rice, I really like the presentation of the dish and the many flavours that it offers. The rice wasn't very tasty though, I was expecting rich and creamy coconut sauce in the rice, but what I got was try, slightly under-cooked rice with barely any coconut flavour. What made the dish worth trying were the toppings. The was some chicken curry on the side and the flavour was a lot better and it has some depth and aroma to it compared to other curries I've tried. The best way to eat this dish is to scope some rice and get some toppings to accompany it to add flavour, because honestly, the rice on its own was very bland.  Saw the featured menu after we placed our order and noticed there's a dish called \"Deep Fried Congee\". Super interesting dish, not sure how I feel about it, maybe I will give it a try if I were to comeback again.  Service:  Even though they serve mainly South Eastern Asian food (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand), the restaurant is run by Cantonese speaking Chinese people. The waiter/owner was super hospitable and was very tentative to our inquiries about the food. She would also come over occasionally to ask how we're doing and to refill our tea.  Exceptional service for a casual dining Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is run by Mandarin people. Came here to try the Malaysian food but it feel way short of my expectations.  Started off with the mixed skewers for $12 (two skewers each of chicken, lamb and beef). The worst skewers I have ever eaten. They were over cooked and had huge chucks of fat on it. The dipping sauce was just as bad. The only good thing that came from ordering the skewers is that they forgot to charge us for it.....LOL  My dad had the Singapore chicken rice for $8.50 - this was pretty decent according to my old man. I never got to try any though :(  My mom got the Malay curry chicken with roti $5.99 + $1 to substitute rice for roti. The curry sauce was really thick and didn't taste really good to me. The roti was really small in size but you do get two of them.   My sister got the laksa for $7.50 - I did get to try a little and it was decent at best. There was hardly any seafood in it.   I got the curry beef brisket with roti $7.50 + $1 to substitute rice for roti. The beef brisket was soft but once again there were huge chucks of fat. The sauce was the same as mentioned above.  Overall, very disappointing. When I am unhappy with my meal I tend to complain about it throughout the whole meal. I think I got that from my dad :)"}
{"text":"Came here recently and had the Hainan chicken and Curry brisket with roti. The chicken was slim and had plenty of flavour and it came with the traditional soup (which was also quite small in size.). The yellow chicken flavored rice was very yummy and it delightful and savory.  The curry brisket however was abit of a disappointment. There wasn't much flavor inside the meat and it was incredibly tough. The flavor of the curry was standard, not spicy as it is hk style. The roti did taste good as it has nice consistency.  Might come back again with my family but I was just abit disappointed with the curry so maybe I'll try something else next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered two take out dishes today. Their door shows a sign that they accept visa/mastercard but they refused it without reason (usually Asian restaurants will put visa/mastercard only if you spend more than an amount like $25). And there is also lack of hospitality when I was there. There was only one table of customers. After she took the money she just ignored me, after few seconds she pointed to my food and said that's yours (there were two take out order there)  The pork dish I ordered cost $12 but they only gave me half of the container.  The chicken dish is yummy.  Not going back even though the chicken was good."}
{"text":"We were in the area originally to try out a neighbouring ramen place that was closed early so decided to check out this place instead.  White Orchid is small family run place serving Singaporean, Malaysian and Thai cuisine.  The place is actually quite upscale looking and well kept.  There's room for no more then 20-25 guests so can be tight fit if crowded.  Despite the mixed reviews we really enjoyed our dinner here.  The satay skewers were very tender tasty, the laksa was flavourful and smooth, and the roti freshly made and soft.  Our signature dish of the evening was the Sweet Chili Singapore Crab and it was very nicely done.   More sweet then spicy and more smoother then a traditional Singapore Crab, but tasty never the less.  Service was outstanding as the server/owner was really sweet, friendly and constantly checking on us how were things.  Definite plus points for that!  Price point here is around $10-$20 with the crab at market price ($43 for ours less then 2lbs).  Overall we definitely had a good dinner here and would not hesitate to come back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"i don't know their food but the owner just assign table not by waiting line up and keep people from waiting. please let people know how many tables to wait and let people to decide rather that just keep people waiting from the dark! sucks"}
{"text":"We came to this place from a friends referral.  We ordered Tea Ribs Vermicelli soup and Hainan chicken.  The chicken was good but quantity was small, basically a small leg.  The rice was good as they put some oil and garlic in it so it was not white rice.  The tea ribs tasted also decent but there was four small pieces of spare rib.  Needless to say we were still hungry afterwards.  But this was not what mainly contributed to my rating....  There's menu's around with items with no pricing on them.  My friend asked how much was this dessert (Sago with coconut milk).  Waitress replied she had to ask her boss.  Waitress came back and said it was $5.  So we said okay, we'll get one order.  She said okay but we'll have to wait for the boss to come back.  I paused to wait for the reason why but nothing happened so I said why.  Waitress says only she knows how to make it....blank stare from us.  We asked when will she be back?  Waitress said shes not sure since she went to buy shoes....second blank stare...  We'll just get the bill then.  Bill came, we'd like to pay with credit card.  Waitress says oh we can't take credit cards.  Okay, we dig for enough cash to pay.  When we left we saw the credit card stickers on their window.  Our just desserts was being lied to.  Oh well, fool me once...etc."}
{"text":"It's like the BEST hainan chicken I've ever had in Tor. So flavourful and so tender at the same time! Really impressed."}
{"text":"stupid restaurant....hair in the 'see dan' dish, please see the pic, msg for video.  always a shortage of employees. terrible, would not admit to this."}
{"text":"This is a small and quiet restaurant that does private kitchen for dinner. I have only come here for lunch and was happy with the food and service. The Hainanese chicken is one of the best I have had. The curry wasn't that special but I think the roti would have been better than the rice. I would say their menu is a little bit more pricey than average but considering the chef has his own cooking show on Omni I think it is justified. I see a lot of people eat alone so it seems to be a popular spot just to go and grab a quick good bite."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  This used to be Delicious Food Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/delicious-food-restaurant-richmond-hill that serves quite unique Fukienese dishes. Now after a revamp, redecoration, renaming and it becomes another Southeast Asian Restaurant.  When I saw the menu posted outside, I was surprised by their price point with entrees from $10 and up. Even fried noodle and rice dishes are all over $10! I don't mind if the food is worth the price but at least the Singapore Laksa ($9) was disappointing lack of the taste of the rich coconut broth nor that spiciness. The noodle was undercooked and really chewy.   The owner, staff and cook are all the same from the previous business. They are nice people and I wish them luck.  The decoration is really nice. The restaurant looks really chic and clean now compare to before. I wish they would have improve on their food too!  BTW,  there is $2 charge person for Chinese tea."}
{"text":"Great place for sharing side dishes with a group of friends! Ordered their curry dishes with Roti and I highly recommend everyone try their thick egg noodles.  Update: they also serve delicious pork belly bao that's not in their regular menu (but might add eventually). Ask their server for the pork belly bao! It's awesome! :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11am on a Saturday given the hours provided on Yelp and on Google but they probably recently changed it to open at 11:30am instead, similar to the other restaurants in the plaza.  We ordered the fried congee, fried turnip cake, laksa, fish noodles, Hainan chicken rice and curry beef brisket with roti.  The fried congee was my favorite.  It was very crunchy and flavorful.  The Hainan chicken was well cooked but beware of biting into little bone pieces due to how it's chopped.    The curry beef brisket was good and I liked that it could come with roti instead of rice (extra cost), but the portion was pretty small.  The fried turnip cake although fried didn't feel overly greasy but they didn't fry it evenly on all sides so nothing amazing.  The sweet hot sauce it came with gave it some flavor.  The fish noodles were a little too fishy for my liking, although the few bites were decent and was just like eating fish paste in noodle form.  Laksa was similar to other ones I've had except maybe a bit spicier but nothing special.          They do have special dishes that apparently you can get if you order in advance.  May come back to try the special dishes but probably nothing off the lunch/regular menu."}
