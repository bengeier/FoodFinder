{"text":"Went there a couple of years ago and had their Pho beef noodle soup.  Greasy and the beef was fatty and full of gristle....awful.  I thought I try again....had the spicy beef noodle soup...again awful.   People who had ordered after me were served before me.  Waited for 15 minutes for their \"fast food\".  Anway, cool the broth, skim the fat and trim the beef.  For really great soup  try the Green Mango at Weston and Langstaff......wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food has always been excellent. I usually order the General Tso Chicken, Pad Thai, House Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef and Crispy Ginger Beef. There's not many Chinese restaurants that serve white meat chicken and large shrimps! They also have the most flavourful hot and sour soup. Service is good, portions are big and the prices are fair so every time I'm craving Chinese food, I'm at Szechuan."}
{"text":"Best pan-asian restaurant period!!! I come here at least 4-5 times per month and the food is  consistently great!   I recommend the Szechuan Chicken, Beef spring rolls, rainbow crystal fold (lettuce wraps) and dynamite rolls!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place.   My friends and I went here to celebrate his birthday.   Food are served fast and hot so that is a good thing. The only problem I have with the place is that all the dishes that we ordered don't come with rice. You have to pay extra for rice. In terms of flavour, Szechuan Szechuan at Vaughan Mills does tastes authentic enough.   Would I recommend driving all the way to Vaughan Mills for this particular restaurant? Most likely not. But if you are hungry after shopping at Vaughan Mills and want some Chinese food, I can recommend this place for a try."}
{"text":"We dined here few times and if nothing else the food quality is pretty consistent. We tried spicy squid which is my favorite but spicy ginger is beef is the dish you gotta have."}
{"text":"Have been going here for over a year. Never been disappointed, last night 4 of us went and eat way too much with a bottle of wine for $120.00. The service is great and the food seems like it's on your table in no time. Every time I go or take out , I try something new. Last night is was the Spicy Orange Beef, excellent. If you are looking for a meal in a bowl, try the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. Surprising considering that everything else is very good, the fried rice is not up to par with the rest of the fair. It's to greasy for my liking, so I now stick to the plain rice."}
{"text":"I have dined both in the restaurant as well as in the take out section in the mall.   For the take out section, I like how quickly the food is ready and the space to eat it in.  It's nice when you want something quick but aren't interested in battling the crowds in the food court.  The food is pretty good and they give you a lot for the price.  Inside the restaurant is quite nice and the food is decent.  I can't say it's the best food I have ever had, but it's not bad either."}
{"text":"From the moment there was zero service when my companion and I stepped in the door, I should have taken the foreshadowed hint and bailed on this place as fast as I could, but I soldiered on, visualizing the four stars that other Yelpers had averaged out on this place. It could be just a fluke, right? I could not have been more incorrect.   It took three minutes to even be noticed by one of the employees there, and she was a waitress, not a hostess. She had to nudge a nearby host to finally come over and place us at our very suddenly, hastily prepared table, menus tossed in a pile at the center.   After taking a moment to figure out what we wanted to eat, we waited patiently for a few minutes, politely and quietly with our menus closed, still waiting for a waiter or waitress to greet and serve us water. It was not until a short while later when our order was being taken when water would finally be served to us, after my companion had to ask. At this point we were already skeptical of this establishment, but when the food was served to us, (In quick fashion, at least) more disappointment struck. We had ordered a Pad Thai and Spicy Peanut Butter Chicken. The Pad Thai's noodles were undercooked, but otherwise had a delicious taste. The Chicken wasn't very complex. Tasted like a mix of way too much Hoisin, some sugar and Peanut Butter. It was very much swimming in sauce and it didn't feel like it had too much complexity to the dish. It was at least moderately spicy. Further, both dishes were warm at best - definitely not fresh from the kitchen, despite the speed with which the dishes were served. Portion sizes were only decent for the cost and quality.   No one came to check on us during the course of our meal, and my empty water glass stood quite empty in a very conspicuous location on the table for over five minutes while waiters walked by repeatedly. Atrocious service. The Bubble Tea I ordered was probably the best part of my meal, despite the typical cost of the drink.   After a very dis-satisfactory experience, we were planning on leaving a very small tip. However you can not, since the tip is added for you automatically! A 15% \"Service Charge!\" - In what establishment for, a party of two, do you automatically have to tip 15%? I didn't notice any such an implication on the menu itself, however I couldn't go back to check either. I believe that is absolutely ridiculous.   It is very hard to recommend this place over some of the very excellent dining establishments that encircle Vaughan Mills, such as Lucky Bamboo and Truly Thai. Will definitely not be dining here again, and I recommend everyone to avoid if you value your time and money.  Of note, they also serve Shark Fin soup. To some this is unacceptable especially given the recent ban in the City of Toronto. Food for thought."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Came with a friend. Took 5 minutes before a waiter came and took our drinks and another 10 minutes to order. Doubt that we will be coming back due to poor service."}
{"text":"I will never come back again. The food was okay, but the service is what makes the difference.Our server is not the one you want to get. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Nice ambiance and service. Dishes are tasty."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Or waiter was very attentive and responsive.  The food was tasty and hot.  The overall experience was great.  Definitely would recommend and come back"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance was great, good portion sizes  as well. but over service needs improvement. We had a larger group for in for a birthday and the server seemed very confused the entire time, and though we were told they would be able to split checks easy when we made the reservation, it seemed to be quite the comedic hassle for the server."}
{"text":"Quality food served fast. Service is pretty steady. This is definatly a great place to come for dinner. If your coming for lunch they got the take out counter, which has better value. I would definatly come back."}
{"text":"This place has been around for many years since vmills opened. I think they have revamped it a bit to have the take out option.  This was my frost time dining in the restaurant. Inside is super nice and modern looking. It has a great ambience. It is a large restaurant and I was surprised there were such few people eating lunch on a Sunday.  I met up with my friend and we split a beef fried rice and rainbow folds. We could not finish either dish. Portions are big and affordable. The meal was around $30.  I loved the rainbow folds. Love anything that is fun to eat! You use the lettuce to wrap the chopped up chicken and vegetables. Similar to Peking duck options.  It was very good. The beef fried rice was average.  Service was really good. They checked in us a few times and refilled our waters.   I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"If it is service with a frown, unhelpful miserable staff you want then this is the place for you, but not me! Never again."}
{"text":"First time here. Went straight to the dine in area instead of the take out area. The servers are super quick and super nice! The food is delicious. And the food presentation is great too! Will definitely come back for more delicious food here!"}
{"text":"Bad service. When I walked in, I had to wait for 10 mins until someone came to seat us. The food was good. After we finished eating, the waiter brought the bill, then he was standing there with the machine waiting for us to pay. We were just taking our time but he was very pushy. Then 5 minutes after we paid, he came to the table and said that we had to leave because other people want to sit in a booth and there is no other booths available.. This is very unprofessional, to be kicked out of a restaurant what kind of service is this"}
{"text":"Really good food & fast service! The price is reasonable! The curry chicken is amazing!! The bubble tea is not bad either. Great restaurant overall! Beautiful ambiance inside the restaurant. I love the casual dining room area if you don't want to sit in the restaurant."}
{"text":"For a Pan-Asian restaurant, this place has nailed down some signature Chinese dishes.   The decor was modern and welcoming.  My family and I were quickly greeted and seated.  Our waitress was very friendly and allowed us plenty of time to review the menu and answered all the questions we had patiently.    After a long day of traveling from Chicago, we were very happy to see our order came.  The crispy Cantonese chow mein was absolutely delicious.   We also ordered beef noodle soup and spicy eggplant.  They were also very good.   The price is reasonable and I would definitely visit again if I'm back in the area!   ."}
{"text":"The food looks kind of appealing to the eyes but once you take a bite of the food, you realized that it's borderline average and has no sense of substance of flavour to any of the dishes. I ordered the udon teriyaki, sesame chicken, crispy ginger beef and hot and sour soup. All of them tasted really bland, adding salt from the table did no justice to any of them. The hot sour soup was a big disappointment, it just tasted like goopy soup with a hint of sour. I am suspecting that the soups are premise already so they aren't even hot cause when we finish ordering , the soup came out within 2mins. Other Chinese places takes time and when you taste the soup, you can really tell that it was just made. The decor is  fancy, the waiter was pleasant, not rude. But I wouldn't come back here for Chinese food again, I rather be at congee queen"}
{"text":"Best best best. Love it so much. I usually get the Szechuan chicken on noodles...it's sooooo good, my boyfriend gets the black bean chicken which is also great. Looking for Asian food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I have been a regular since they opened this location in Vaughan Mills. I kept hearing really good things about their other location at First Canadian Place. I have to be honest, if i had reviewed this restaurant 5 years ago, I would have rated it only 3 stars. On my last few visits, the quality has improved greatly.   Ordered:  Crispy Ginger Beef - warm, fresh, crispy and a generous portion Pork Fried Rice - generous amount of fresh rice with a good portion of veggies & meat Dumplings - one of the best i've had - fresh and huge! General Tso Chicken - crispy & delish!  Everything was served hot, fresh and with generous portions - the sauces & seasoning on everything is really good. Full of flavour!  Their service has never been their strong point. My review is based solely on my food experiences. If i had to i would deduct 1 star for their mediocre service. Servers need to smile a bit more - they always look angry, unhappy & annoyed"}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaurants I have dined in. All of their rice dishes are extremly well prepared and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love szechuan their food is great, I like this one better than the other location, chilli chicken is my favorite dish, staff is friendly and they already know my order when I walk in"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vaughan mills doing some shopping and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Ever since I first came to this mall this restaurant has been there, but this was y first time visiting. My concern was the decor looked good, reminiscent of Dragon legend buffet, but since it was in the mall I was picturing Manchu wok food with high prices.  Most of my assumptions were correct upon entering. The decor is decent, prices were a smidge higher then usual but the food was actually tastier then I expected.  The service was definitely lack luster though. We stopped in at 5 on a Friday and the place was empty. Took us 4 minutes before we were acknowledged. When we were seated, they just gave us menus without asking us what we wanted to drink and just walked off. Service could have been better, but guess they didn't care.   If Im in the mall I wouldn't mind coming back, but again wouldn't look to come here specifically."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner on New Year's Eve, so this is a bit of a late post. And I wish I had taken pictures because the food was great. And between 3 of us we ordered a lot of food. It was a bit excessive, but there were leftovers that we split between the 2 of us. First off, I was surprised that they even had room for us as it was a bit of a last minute decision, But the 2 hostesses at the front desk were helpful and made sure to tell us that before 5:30 they would be able to seat us. After that, we would have to wait. 5:30 worked perfect for us and it was busy enough in the restaurant but no completely packed. Here's what we ordered: we started with the calamari; and our mains were the hot spicy peanut chicken, crispy ginger beef, szechuan fish, and the crispy cantonese chow mein. We also added 2 bowls of rice. I thought the food was great as did my brother and our friend. Everything was delicious and seasoned just right. Some places are heavy on the salt and even the spice, but the hot spicy peanut chicken and the ginger beef had the right amount of heat that didn't burn your face off, yet had that little kick at the end. Needless to say, we were stuffed by the end of it, even though we all wanted to finish what we ordered. Lol. We just couldn't do it. If you're ever at Vaugan Mills, check this place out. The food is good and the staff are friendly and the service quick. There's also a take-out counter that I've heard good things about so if you don't have time to sit down, this is another good option."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at Szechuan Szechuan.  Steve and Dave started with soup.  They also ordered tuna rolls and sashimi (more than they expected arrived).  Not my thing but pretty!  Steve and Dave both ordered Szechuan Beef with a side of white rice.  I love Szechuan Szechuan but haven't been in a long time (it's the first time I've been to this location).  I ordered what I usually get ... Szechuan Chicken with a side of white rice.  There was a lot and I had good intentions of eating half and taking the other half home for supper ... but it was so delicious that I ended up eating it all but the green peppers!  Our server took good care of us."}
{"text":"The wife and I haven't been here in years! On a whim we decided to go for a nice quiet lunch and hit up one of our favourite spots from years ago!    We ended up ordering more that we should have but that's ok always leftovers for work!  We started with the veggie spring rolls which were very crispy and fried to perfection. Only downside of this app was that the sweet/sour or plum sauce was a little on the skimpy side. I wish we had more but we made due.   We also had the BBQ prom bun and the steamed Wonton in a peanut sauce. The BBQ pork buns are one of our favourites and they didn't disappoint he bun was soft and fluffy and the filling was nice and juicy.   The steamed Wonton was perfection! The Wonton was soft and delicate with a nice spicy peanut sauce. I have to admit I dipped my spring roll into the peanut sauce!  For the mains we had the vegetable fried rice and the General Tso chicken. The rice was fluffy the veggies inside were perfect. The General Tso chicken was exactly as we remembered it to be. The chicken was crispy and the sauce on top was dark and thick and delicious.   All in all we had a great lunch and have some leftovers for lunch the next day!  Go enjoy This restaurant as it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while holiday shopping and had a great dinner! We ordered four dishes and a few appetizers for four people and there was a ton of food!   For appetizers, we had the shrimp dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps. For dinner we had the general tso chicken, Singapore rice noodles, Szechuan white fish, and Cantonese shrimp crispy noodles. All were delicious!!   I loved the red and black interior. Large booths for groups. Great for gatherings. Large open space.   Friendly staff and quick service. I really enjoyed my meal here!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner of the mall, this place has a nice atmosphe. I find it awkward that if you walk in though the mall entrance you have to walk through the restaurant to the exterior entrance to the hostess to be seated.   The service was super fast, and friendly. Our meal came out before we were half done our soup. The food was all delicious, the lemon chicken is highly recommended, although a little on the sweet side, you could almost have it for dessert. Portions were quite large as well.  The only thing I didn't enjoy overly was the rice, it was very average and kinda dry, the chicken balls were fifty percent batter, the hot and sour soup was tasty and the Cantonese chow mien was pretty good too.  Overall the experience was a positive one, but unfortunately the food was only average. I wouldn't avoid the place, but I'm not jumping out of my seat to get back there either. The price was on par or slightly more than other average type Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Was in the Vaughan area and craving sushi which is what brought me to this place. I ordered the big house sushi roll and a salmon roll.  I found it a bit pricey for what is was, especially in comparison to many of the downtown TO sushi/Chinese places although I must say the pieces were very big.   The reason for the 4 stars is the service.  We were lucky enough to get seated and served by Herman (Name was according to the receipt, I hope it's the right person!).  He was so nice, informative, attentive, funny, and bubbly.  He took extra care when packing up our food at the end, and even included more wasabi and soy sauce to bring home.  You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does and this restaurant is lucky to have him.  It's service such as this that will bring me back the next time I'm in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice,  portions were big,  but the food didn't taste quite right.  I have a hunch that there's a white guy trying to make Asian food in the kitchen but not really understanding what anything is supposed to taste like.   Curry was still powdery (how?!?), Tom Yum was too seasoned and the flavor balance was way off,  the Lemon Chicken was mostly honey flavored with breading that was too crunchy for lemon chicken.  If you're going to order something with flavor,  pick a different place."}
{"text":"Condescending waiters, cold food, and unable to customize anything on the menu. This restaurant is a joke of a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the crispy beef and general Tao chicken. Much better than PF changs. Good service too. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is the best :) always fresh and yeah a bit costly but its worth it. They do take it out try them."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've had in Vaughan, staff are incredibly rude (apart from one older gentleman) and made us to feel hugely unwelcome. If I hadn't paid for my food already I would have walked out. As for the food, everything was incredibly bland, no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. The only exception was general tso's chicken. In all fairness, I can't complain about that one dish as I really did enjoy it... Although not enough to ever return."}
{"text":"This is my moms FAVOURITE chineese food. Im not sure why tho.. Everytime we go its very loud and filled with little kids.  -Decor. is cool -Friendly staff -Food is alright -price is average  We ordered delivery a few days ago and it had NO TASTE! It all tasted very strange... it took over an hour to get to our house and we live only 15 minutes away."}
{"text":"Dined at this establishment on several occasions, usually at someone else's request. I have friends that love this place, myself, I'm \"meh\" on it.   Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the place....there are just better and less expensive places to dine than here. Perhaps being an anchor in the mall causes higher fees for the restaurant, resulting in higher prices for average food.   I go for the General Tao chicken....it's good with a slight heat....but can be fatty and gristly on occasion. I usually stick to that as other items were a disappointment.  I have never had a problem with service...they've always been attentive and fast. Ambience is good...but when busy it an be quite loud and quiet conversations are next to impossible."}
{"text":"It is what it is: a more dressed up version of the Mandarin sans the buffet experience in the corner of Vaughan Mills. I've come here about half a dozen times and I don't know what it is about this place but it's just...mediocrity at it's finest. The menu consists of a plethora of 'Asian' fusion options that would appeal to anyone looking for a quick Chinese/Japanese/Thai fix but it really isn't anything to write home about; the food lacks the complexity of flavours that your palate is looking for when consuming foods from these respective countries and their cultures.   It's not bad, it's just, not particularly good either: far too sweet and too salty. At times, you are able to distinguish the exact ingredients they used which destroys half the fun in the appreciation of these cultures respective cuisine styles which would otherwise form a unique unidentifiable meld.   The servers are relatively attentive and I can't say I've ever had a bad customer service experience here.   It's not my first pick for my dumpling, sushi, or some variation of stir fry fix.. but to be completely honest, I'll be back. Not because it would be my top choice, but simply out of the convenience of the location and the food while lacklustre, isn't a total right off: it is what it is, an unremarkable food fusion experience."}
{"text":"Clearly they are making so much money that they have forgotten customer service and quality has gone way down!  Both our general tso chicken and ginger beef look and taste the same. It's like they take the same sauce and toss it on everything. We asked about this and our waitress just argued with us, as if we are just crazy. Everything was soo salty.   Just poor quality!"}
