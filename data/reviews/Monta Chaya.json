{"text":"My first time and there was no wait, so plus. Wait staff are friendly & accommodating; the menu is simple and easy to read; price is reasonable less than $10 for a regular size bowl of ramen. i would come back here."}
{"text":"Let me start by disclosing that in no way shape or form am I a \"ramen connoisseur\" a \"ramen expert\" and I'm pretty sure that I can't tell you the difference in the noodles.  I am however a lover of all things food, and especially soups.  I love..love...love...love.love.Monta Chaya.  I also love (the same amount of times) the original Monta in Chinatown.  What I love as much as the first set of loves is that its literally 5 minutes from my house now.  I love how everyone greets you when you walk in and leave, I love the shoyu ramen, I love the fried rice...I however don't love the shisito peppers...the sauce is nasty (in my opinion).  The peppers will not keep me from coming back weekly.  I hate pork...if you didn't know pigs don't sweat...well never mind that's for another day...so I order it with chicken broth minus the pork.  Yummy!!  I love it so much that I'm eating soup in the 110+ degree weather.  When its as good as Monta it doesn't matter if its the surface of the sun, its still freaking good."}
{"text":"Second time at this location, had a free assorted appetizers which between the the chicken and the calmari you can't go wrong. Went with the Miso Ramen.   I do have to say Joseph our server was very informative of everything on the menu, I swear if you ever were lost this is the guy you'd want to get directions from!!!! He explained fully anything we asked with explicit detail, like you could ask him \"how do boil water\" and he would make that sound interesting!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Price, pork belly bowl is epic!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and really cheap considering the quality of the food is excellent. I try to go here about once a week. Also the workers are pretty awesome. Especially Joe because he went to the same high school my mom went to in Hawaii lol."}
{"text":"I like the calamari, it was crispy and taste really match up with the soup which I think it was the tempura soup. For Ramen, it was neutral and not so different from other ramen place. So, I would give a 4 stars as i was so so for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Spicy tonkutsu with extra egg and karaage. Very good combination, they just need a bigger space, this place is always pack with people."}
{"text":"We love the original Monta Ramen and were excited to come here since the original location usually has 30-60 minute wait times.    We were already repeat customers of the original Monta on Spring Mountain, so we ordered the usual Tonkatsu ramen bowls at this location.  Overall the food was good and tasted the same as the original.  The reason for 2 stars however came when my gf discovered a bug in her soup (after finishing all the ramen).  It was a small black beetle - we're just really happy it wasn't a cockroach which would have been 100x worse.  When we notified the server, she was more stressed out than she was concerned (probably about trying to think about how to handle the situation when there were already 4 bowls of eaten ramen on our table of 4).  She took the bowl away and one of the cooks came out to apologize.  She then said that the bug must have fallen into the bowl while it was on the counter waiting to be served - perhaps as a way to dodge the fact that it was probably in the soup pot and all 4 bowls of our ramen were most likely affected (and the whole restaurant's served ramen for that matter).  Anyways, we didn't argue it and she ended up making the 1 bowl of ramen (but not all 4), and our appetizer free of charge.    Not a great experience (and we didn't like the way the server handled the problem) but we'll probably be back every now and then and just hope this instance was a rare fluke.  P.S.  Other than the bug, the ramen honestly tasted fine (food is 5 stars).  Tonkatsu is definitely our favorite since its the creamier soup and not as salty as the Shoyo version.  They always cook their noodles perfectly, and the meat is super-fall-apart-tender and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best ramen I've had so far in Vegas. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is amazing. I recommend this for everyone!"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Vegas from the New England, we were craving ramen.  Having lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and frequenters of Ippudo in New York, you can consider us ramen fiends.    FOOD - We ordered tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu-shoyu ramen (it's NOT \"tonKATsu,\" people!), gyoza, kimchi fried rice, pork belly bowl, and mini mentaiko bowl.  Yes, a lot of food for 3, but again, we're fatties!  I could not finish my ramen (this NEVER happens!), because the broth was too oily and too salty.  It was saltier and oilier than any kotteri broth I've ever had, really inedible.  The noodles were perfectly cooked (though we ordered katamen - firm noodles - so that's a confounder), though.  I was sad that I couldn't eat more of the noodles because the oily broth was just too much of a turn off.  The side dishes, though, were SUPER good.  The gyoza was steamed and fried perfectly, so I was glad.  The kimchi fried rice was very tasty and the kick of sour kimchi was really good.  The pork belly bowl was pretty good, but I still LOVE the one from Daikokuya in LA.  The mentaiko bowl was also good, per my husband, as I don't particularly enjoy mentaiko.  AMBIANCE - par for the course for a ramen shop.    SERVICE - attentive and appropriate to assure quick turnovers during rush time!  lots of enthusiastic greetings like most ramen shops.  There was a reasonable wait (about 20 minutes) when we went at lunch time.  VALUE - decently priced!  didn't break the bank like Ippudo does :P  PARKING - ample parking outside!  Overall, ramen in LA is still the best on the west coast!"}
{"text":"How can the place earn 4 stars? Five stars for delicious food N decent price!! You know what,give one star for waitress service,if u don't really like ur job,just do something else what can make u happy please!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Japanese Noddle House! I love their misu ramen and egg! Rice and that spicy green pepper that they have omg soo delicious!!! The calamari is very unique favored- definitely recommend this place! Affordable price as well! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! :) Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good! The service was quick and the staff is friendly. We ordered ramen, gyoza and kimchi fried rice which was all great! They even serve some beers. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I recently ate here. At first, I was feeling great about the place. The restaurant had really good energy. The service was fast. The menu was really small. I ordered and the food was good. Nothing exceptional. But then I saw one of the cooks chewing as he was making a salad. I continued to watch him and sure enough he was popping lettuce into his mouth. He was eating part of the salad he was preparing for a customer. This really grossed me out. Shortly after eating here I got a stomach ache. I could only help but wonder if it was because of the poor health standards of this cook. He was a Hispanic male in his 30 s. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Love their ramen and fried rice. Price is not cheap but totally worth it! Soup is a bit salty but I guess it's the broth. You can tell they spend hours to make the broth. The seasonings for the fried rice is so good that stays in my mouth after I leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good ramen, but overpriced sides (eg eggs, notice, etc). I often go here just for the pork belly bowl and the chasu buns. Gyozas are okay and the tonkatsu shoyu ramen is the best out of the other choices for me. I love this place though. Better than Chinatown's because this place is spacious, has friendly staff, and great service. Plus, it's close to my house so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and their ramen hits the spot! I was in the mood for noodles after watching Mind of a Chef on Netflix and their ramen was so satisfying. I'm so glad it's fall again so I can go back for more!"}
{"text":"It is now 8:58pm and at home. Put in a take out order at 7:36pm for a Pork Belly Bowl and Mini Mentaiko. Gentlemen that answered took my name and number down and said it would be ready in 25 mins. I entered the restaurant at 7:50pm. 2 servers on the floor asked if I was here for to dine in or pickup, I said pickup. They didn't even ask for my name, didn't bother me at the time thinking they knew what it was. I waited and left at 8:10, I work in the industry as well and this is actually the first time a restaurant forgot my order. It's a shame because the food is good, maybe I'll just dine in instead of order take out. I don't really yelp but in this situation I just had to. Thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. I wish they had a few more options on the menu but sometimes simplicity is what makes the brand stand out. It truly is the \"in and out\" of Japanese style noodle dishes with its simple, yet \"tackle the craving\" type of menu. The service was good. Price was very fair for the amount of servings you get. (I couldn't finish my entire bowl and it was a $7 bowl) and the chatsu bans, omg so yummy. Also the fried rice was very authentic, not the cheap rendition of fast-food-Chinese kind that is the norm these days. (People actually think that is how fried rice is supposed to be) but that's an argument for another day. This place is totally worth revisiting when noodle soup sounds good."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant! Its my first time going to this location but I've been to the one in Chinatown multiple times. This is seriously my favorite ramen place in town. Their ramen is delicious, and also their rice bowls. I recommend trying their pork belly bowl, or the shoyu ramen w/ the black garlic to top it off. I also saw they now have a new choice of red ramen? But I'm not sure, that'd be pretty cool though. Their service is the same as in Chinatown, pretty good. All the mon places are ALWAYS busy, so make sure you're going on a good day. Overall, I'd defintely come back! The food is yummy."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and went to  Monta Ramen on Eastern today,   It was a big disappointment.  My friend said the other Monta on Spring Mountain Road was too dirty and being shut down by Health District, we should pick another restaurant, I think I should have listened.    I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with garlic,  it looks tasty on the photo which they put up on the wall.  However, when  the server put the bowl in front of me, oh, it was totally different from the photo,  it looks like a layer of dust or dirt on top of the ramen,  It only came with 2 thin slices of pork with a lot of fat.  It does not taste good at all, in fact, that was the worst ramen I ever have.   The ramen was bad but the service is OK.   I don't think I will go back to this ramen restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"good but monta ramen is still my fav! plus this place it too far for my taste..."}
{"text":"Still the best ramen in Las Vegas, and not as slammed as the main location. My fave is the kuro ramen, extra egg and butter. Beyond delicious, plus the staff is friendly and accommodating to special requests."}
{"text":"BOMB ramen, probably the best I've had. The broth was so flavorful. We really enjoyed the spicy miso ramen, the pork belly bowl, and the crispy rice. Our server Joe was especially awesome!"}
{"text":"Everything here is layered with awesome flavors. And the wine selection is pretty solid as well. If you're looking to take someone off the strip for some great food, this should be considered."}
{"text":"Just an OK ramen place. The broth is a bit too thick and the fatty meat will melt in the broth, which makes the whole bowl more oily. Plus, service is really slow here. Not sure it's the problem of front or back of house. Hopefully there are better ramen restaurants in LV."}
{"text":"Horrible service. My waitress didn't listen to my order when I asked for things I'm allergic to not to be in my food. She was rude towards me when I asked questions about the food. They take forever just to bring my table the two bowls of white rice we were missing. And she continues to walk back and forth without acknowledging that we were missing two bowls of rice. Worst. Place. To. Eat."}
{"text":"Huge fan, love this place I'm almost always satisfied with my service unless I come during the day, The service is terrible. The servers that are usually here at night Are such sweethearts! Then there's usually just two women who look about 30 here during the day a lot of the time that are so rude. It makes me sad because I'm such a fan of this place."}
{"text":"unfriendly staff, would not recommend this place, service is poor, food is okay, the actual noodle itself is horrible, maybe because they forgot to serve it in a timely manner, i hate when the restroom are dirty, makes me feel like the whole place is filthy including the food"}
{"text":"This is an amazing low price ramen noodle shop..  I will definitely be back.  A bit small and wait time is long, but we'll worth the wait.  I loved the ramen and gyoza.  Great atmosphere to just sit and chill with friends or alone to enjoy a great bowl of soup."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's comfort food. It's cold outside! I keep coming back because it's the best ramen in town! My favorite at least :)"}
{"text":"Good tonkotsu ramen, tried the new  kuro ramen but preferred the tonkotsu shio ramen. Also tried the crispy sushi with spicy tuna, will pass on that next time. Spicy tuna rather bland. Very similar to the Spring Mtn shop sans long lines .  We still prefer the Spring Mtn venue, however."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya is my all time favorite place for comfort food. The menu is simple and there's something for everyone. I've tried almost every dish on the menu and have never been disappointed. The quick, efficient, and friendly service makes returning so easy."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I have had better ramen. Looks appetizing but flavor is flat. So not get the pork belly buns. They are not that great either. I would pass on this place. Quite expensive for something that is bland.   Service is also not so great. I didn't get a spoon and had to ask for it 3 times for my ramen. Still didn't get it. Also they did not give us any refills until we paid."}
{"text":"Tried to go yesterday, is under renovation till 3/31/2017.  No advance notice and we were just there 2 weeks ago  Love their fast service expect for the karaage, last one on the table to eat.  Food is great!"}
{"text":"Good ramen for good price! Feels like im in korea again..lolz..musta try the TONKOtSU ShOYU RAmeN..$6.95 not bad price...  Place is alil bit small yet food is great..i just wish they will expand their resto ....so if u wanna b here come early coz its a long wait to be seated...where in u will make much hungry..lolz..^_^"}
{"text":"This place is bomb dot com! My husband and I have been here twice so far, and both times the food was stellar and the atmosphere is awesome. We sat at the bar both visits and it's fun to watch them in action making all the dishes! This place is definitely a go to place for us from now on  Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"They last time I got to go prefer they messed up a lot but I thought I'd give them another chance and I'm so glad I did. The only thing I wish for was for the ramen to go to be the same amount as dine in. It's a bit less. And I wish they have the spices on the table to go."}
{"text":"Insult to Japan and Japanese food. Salty, flavorless Top Ramen. Ordered spicy, actually received regular but, charged additionally for spicy. Condiments: pink pickled ginger, strange garlic mixture; both from a package opened who knows when, random ingredients thrown together to create a \"spicy\" topping, old sesame seeds, etc. A steamed bun with a small piece of pork+iceberg lettuce!? Staff yelling to kitchen from across the small restaurant. Awkward! Also, rumor has it their other location was closed by the health department. So sad.  First and possibly last time here."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and added extra chasu and flavored egg. Soup base was good, noodle had a good firmness, however the spicy paste addition to make it spicy felt a little lethargic in the effort department. Flavored egg is worth the extra cost. Karage was ok, kind of soggy. Pork Bun was okay, lacked flavor, sort of bland. Per coming from LA, I have higher standards for ramen. Waitress was kind and diligent. Green tea came out of a can for 1.75. Came here because I was craving ramen in Vegas, it was satisfactory"}
{"text":"Ramen was delicious, and customer service on point! Went in an hour before closing, it was busy but we were seated immediately. The servers are very nice and accommodating. Reasonable pricing, will def. return!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Everyone else in the restaurant had gotten their order but they forgot ours and our waitress kept telling us that it was coming clearly knowing it was missed."}
{"text":"Let's start with beverages. What is up with hot tea being served from a can? Is this a Vegas thing? If so, very tacky Let's get to the ramen...  Being under the weather, I thought a nice hot bowl would be a good soothing satisfying meal.  Unfortunately on the contrary here which makes me ask \"How does it have a 4 star rating?   I ordered the Black Garlic Oil to be spicy. What a fail! What I thought was going to be a nice bold flavored broth, looks like dirty sink water and taste like gritty salt water. Not impressive to say the least. Spicy Top Ramen has more flavor. I don't care for spicy food that kills my tastebuds but this doesn't even come close to having any heat that I find myself generously sprinkling tougarashi. I asked the waitress how spicy was this to be? She replies Very spicy. I tell her otherwise and she just shrugs which then determines her tip and the final point of giving this place one star.   Although  cozy and somewhat clean (the only qualities that redeemed itself to one star) it hardly is worth a visit. You're better off spending your $10 -12 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Update as of late 2015:    They now allow you to customize the saltiness of your order. Just let the server know. So much better.   My original July 205 review:  It's a nice place but practically all their food is excessively SALTY so if you have hypertension like me - you should stay away if you can from this place.  My sons love this place and occasionally I join them - the one dish that's medium salty is the pork belly bowl.  All the noodles are super salty and can really raise your blood pressure. Beware.  All drinks are served in cans so don't expect any refills."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen so we went to  Monta Chaya on Eastern.  The reviews were really good so we just had to try it.  We ordered the tonkatsu ramen and pork belly bowl.  Both dishes were sooooo full of oil and pork fat.  We picked through our ramen, did not drink the broth.   The broth is like a thick gravy with lots of oil.  I don't think it's the good kind of fat either.  It's probably pork fat I'm guessing.  Now for the pork belly bowl.  You can't really see the oil in the pork belly bowl because the rice soaks it up.  Ask the server for a side of the sauce that goes in the pork belly bowl and you will see what I mean.  The pork belly bowl was kind of bland so we asked for a side of sauce.  There is about 1/2\" layer of pure melted, saturated fat on top of the sauce.  I'm not a health nut but I try to watch what I eat and this stuff is totally off the charts.  I've been to other ramen houses in Las Vegas and they are no where as greasy as this place.  If you like good ramen, try Sora Ramen on Spring Mountain.  Very authentic Japanese ramen $6.95 and you can get a mini curry bowl (delicious) for $2.65.  Oh, and the service was excellent and the waittress was awesome so that was the only good thing about Monta Chaya.  But I will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"If anyone has been to the Monta on Spring Mountain know how busy and delicious it is... I have great news; this location is just as good but half the traffic.    The layout it pretty much the same with the bar seating and the L shape tables except there a little more walking area and space between tables.  The menu is exactly the same down to the prices. Also when you order here they do not use paper they use a mini IPad and it goes straight to the POS system.   Overall just as good as the original but less traffic and a lot closer to my house :)"}
{"text":"Monta, now closer to home. Gyoza is good, noodles are good, the whole thing is great.  Getting the mixed brother is nice, but in summer time the hiyashi chuka can't be beat. Such a great variety of food, side dishes and always consistently good quality.  Parking is ample, space is still limited. Go in off peak hours for best results. It's conveniently right next to Japan Creek, so you can walk next door, buy similar ingredients and make ramen at home. Then cry into your bowl, as it fails to taste even a third as good as what you just had from Monta."}
{"text":"TL;DR  Food Taste: 5 Food Quantity: 5 Service: 4 Price: $$ (bowl of ramen with extra meat and an appetizer/side dish puts you at about 18-20 with tax and tip, no EtOH) Value: 4.5  Apparently this place is related to the Monta down in Chinatown. While I had frequented the Chinatown location on several occasions, it was becoming quite tedious to drive out there for a ramen fix. Then I found out they opened up a branch store in Henderson, and happiness befell me. Then I found out that they had more culinary experiments at this location, and bliss tickled my tongue.  Ramen: Several varieties. most are familiar to Monta-goers. Shoyu (soy sauce), Tonkotsu, Shoyu-Tonkotsu, and Miso. There are the addition of Kuro/Black (Tonkotsu + black garlic oil) and Red (Tonkotsu + red hot spicy whatevers).  Overall, the broths are less salty than the Chinatown location (makes it less authentic, but certainly more palatable if you like to finish the soup.), otherwise most are the same except for the addition of the black and red ramen.   The Black ramen gets its name and color from the roasted garlic oil. Gives the soup a speckly black appearance, and gives the ramen a slightly bitter taste. Either way, if you like garlic with a hint of bitter, this is an excellent ramen.  The Red ramen is just angry spicy. Think of it as your Tonkotsu ramen + Sriracha. Probably a match made in heaven for some people. I have no problems with it.  Appetizer: Crispy Rice with spicy tuna topping. One word: delicious. The crunch of the sushi rice topped with the pleasantly spicy tuna is probably the most amazing thing ever. If you came here and just got 3 orders of this and had nothing else, I wouldn't blame you at all. (Note: tuna is raw.)  The other appetizers aren't so bad either, but that Crispy rice.......*drool*  Conclusion: Hooray! A ramen place close to home with other goodies!"}
{"text":"Really good noodles. The staff is friendly and the dinning room is clean. Two bowls of noodles, two appetizers and two sodas came out too be $27...not bad for how good it is."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was delicious! It was my first time going to a place for authentic ramen so I was kind of nervous as to if I was going to like it or not, and I loved it! A little small, but the staff and food totally make up for it! As soon as you walk through the door they all greet you! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Darn it i hate this place for being so far away from the house on a positive note wonderful and yummy i had the kimichi fried rice (raised on it so im slightly picky) was wonderful just the right amount of heat and the flavor was great prices low food quality high a place to come to"}
{"text":"Came in at 6:30 on a Monday night. Minimal wait for a table, simple menu, quick service, and yummy food. My kids, whom are normally very picky, loved everything. This was a first time visit for us, but won't be the last. I had the miso ramen: added corn, eggs, and nori. Next time I'm getting extra eggs - they are SO GOOD!!!   Saw a table next to us with 2 orders of potstickers. They weren't on the menu, but we would have ordered them had they of been."}
{"text":"Reasonable price, very good and tasty ramen. I recommend the tonkotsu ramen and fried rice."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Ramen! If you live in henderson don't waste your time driving to China town.  This spot has it all. We have always had to wait but they get people in and out fast !"}
{"text":"Came in late, about 10:15p, but the service and food were still great! The 6 of us were sat in minutes. The Shoyu Ramen was good, but I didn't like the pork slices (fatty). I also ordered the Spicy Fried Rice (I think it was called that) and that was an awesome appetizer, thinking back, it was easily my favorite food of the entire meal. Had two kids with us, and the server told us we can order just the plain noodles without the broth (not on the menu), which they enjoyed. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Monta sent to Henderson their better sister, Monta Chaya, with the best location in town,(still with small parking lot)  Monta Chaya is beautiful japanese ramen shop closes to us."}
{"text":"Yum! I wish to come here more often but they need more tables. The food is delicious will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"If your from Japan or want to have a bowl of Ramen and feel like you went to Japan, this is the spot!  I think their best Ramen is Miso Ramen with Extra Chashu. The broth is rich and flavorful and their chashu is delicate and yummy.  I no longer need to drive to Spring Mtn. to have Ramen. ARIGATO!!!"}
{"text":"They had really nice waiters and the ramen was superb. The soup reminded me of like a Japanese woman's tears of happiness when she found out she was reuniting with a loved one. Also, the bamboo shots are poppin."}
{"text":"The best soup I've ever had, seriously. Small establishment with fast and attentive service.  They specialize in Tonkatsu soup.  I get the one with thin Ramen noodle, pork broth, pork meat, mushroom and my additional ingredients (egg, corn and a side order of pork belly with rice)  It's sooooo good. Anyone I've brought with me loves it as well."}
{"text":"Diclaimer: I'm not a ramen expert since I have not had ramen from Japan.  Prior to Monta, I only have Cup O'noodles and Top Ramen Instant Noodles experience.   This eatery serves  the best ramen I've had in Las Vegas (I've also tried Ramen Sora but did not write a review).  The first time I tried Monta was at their Las Vegas location off Spring Mountain 3 years ago.  Since then, I have new respect for ramen and visit very often, especially in the cold months of winter (It definitely hits the spot).   I've tried all 4 ramen broths (Shoyu,Tonkatsu, Shoyu-Tonkatsu, and Miso) and my favorite is the Shoyu-Tonkatsu with shredded green onion or mustard leaves.  The broth is thick, milky and flavorful.  The ramen is firm yet tender.   During the hot summers, my wife loves the cold noodle with yuzu sauce... just noodles,  with a ponzu type (citrus) dressing.   My boys 9 and 11 enjoy it very much as well.  There are more options down on Spring mountain, but this is an excellent option for those in Henderson."}
{"text":"Genuine.  A much abused term in Vegas.  In this rare case, absolutely true.  I haven't had a better ramen since Japan, and it is not for the lack of trying in many large cities. And unlike some Japanese houses, no huge bill, no wait line, no feeling uncomfortable in presence of a respected chef.   I'm working my way through the menu, one lunch at the time..."}
{"text":"Bomb ramen and I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown?? Yaaaasss! The gyoza and ramen is delicious and CHEAP! Monta is always a good choice!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what true ramen was suppose to taste up until my first visit to Monta two years ago. The restaurant since has changed my taste buds completely and raised my standards for the Japanese art of ramen. I have visited Monta already ten times since and I have no intentions of stopping.  Upon entering and leaving Monta you're greeted by both the waiting staff and the kitchen. The dining room is small which generally leads to some sort of wait but the ramen is worth the wait. My favorite is the miso ramen which is tonkotsu ramen pork bone broth with a miso base. Standard ramen toppings are two pieces of chashu pork, bamboo shoots and sliced black mushrooms. The chashu pork are divine slices of pork belly with just the right amount of fat to felt in your mouth. You can also choose from a variety of other toppings that you can add for a little extra. Aside from ramen the restaurant has some other dishes like fried rice, gyoza, and pork belly buns. The fried rice is my favorite to get alongside ramen. Something about it is just so delicious.   If you're looking to try ramen in Las Vegas do not waste your time and head to Monta. Exceptional quality ramen coupled with very affordable prices make this a must-go place to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! My usual order is the porkbelly bowl and tonkatsu ramen. Sometimes I'll order the crispy tuna or the shishito peppers. My order is always consistent and great tasting. The staff is friendly but this restaurant tends to get busy quick at their peak times. I would suggest going during off peak times. My spot for ramen everytime!"}
{"text":"I always loved this place.  I eat here quite often and the staff remembers me even if it's been a while.  the food is great and is my number one Ramen destimation in town.  I love the Tonktatsu-Shoyu blend and the fried rice is to absolutely die for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen shop.  I am so glad they're now in Henderson."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with my friend. Service was so fast! Ryan, the server was super friendly and nice, not to mention he was so cute! The food came out really really quick and was easy to customize. It was my friends first time and even though the menu is small, Ryan gave us excellent recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On a rainy day, ramen is a necessity to stay warm and Monta is the perfect choice! I like monta Chaya (the Henderson location on eastern) better than the monta in Chinatown because it's bigger, there's never a wait, the staff is friendlier, and there's a bigger selection of appetizers!  My favorites: green tea, shishitsu peppers, and miso ramen.   the shishitsu peppers are flash fried, offering js the right amount of crisp and soft center to every bite. The sauce they glaze over the peppers is sweet and complements the slight hint of spiciness from the peppers.  But what monta is known for is their miso ramen, and hands down, this is the best tasting miso broth in Vegas. It's light and not too salty. The pork is so tender that it js melts in your mouth. Add in some egg and seaweed, and my ramen experience is mouthwatering perfection."}
{"text":"I really like Monta Chaya. I am surprised that I have not left a review yet. This location is more spacious than the original location. Best ramen in town. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya is a very good casual ramen place in the Henderson area. If you like the Monta on the other side of town but don't want to make the drive, Monta Chaya is a good alternative.  If you have a ramen craving, you can get the tonkatsu (pork broth) ramen, shoyu (\"soy sauce\" broth) ramen, or a combination of both for $6.95, and an extra helping of ramen without soup is $1.50 (kaedama). If it's your carb day, the ramen is a good choice. The broth is very thick and flavorful. You can taste the hours of work put into extracting the marrow from the pork, and you'll have to control yourself from drinking all of the soup (especially if you're watching your sodium).  If you're looking for a more protein-heavy meal, you should try the pork belly bowl (regular size is $5.75). The pork is marinated and there's a good helping of it to satisfy your craving. The rice is nicely steamed, a rarity in Vegas, and complements the pork belly very well, balancing the flavors for a delicious meal.  The restaurant is crowded and can get loud at times, but the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. There can be a 15-30 minute wait if you're there during busy hours, but the food is worth the wait.  I'd recommend anyone in the area craving good ramen to check out Monta Chaya!"}
{"text":"I love Japanese food!  This place is just great and their specialty is ramen.  And I have had ramen at other locations and none are as good as what this place serves!!!"}
{"text":"Ramen so close. Delicious noodles are here. Must Try the gyoza.  That's my haiku, because the special crafting of Monta's ramen deserves more culture than just an empty, barbaric review. I was worried this new location would deliver less qualities, because sequels almost always suck. Worry not, just as good as the original!  I'm very picky about my gyoza, and Monta has consistently been the best. Same with Monta Chaya, still the best around!  I can't wait for my hiyashi chuka fix now, expect imminent return."}
{"text":"I love Monta and finally I don't have to drive to Chinatown anymore.  My favorite, Cold Noodles with Yuzu. Everybody should try them!  Draft beer for the win."}
{"text":"After doing some business at AT&T next door, we wanted to fill our tummies and relax with some tasty ramen.   Walked in at around 2:25p, low and behold they close at 2:30.  Yipes.  Hostess/Waitress lets us know we need to order IMMEDIATELY.  We feel ya lady...so sorry!  However, after only looking at the menu for less than 1min, she is hustling us to order.  After not being ready just yet, she comes back hustling us to order again - but this time with notepad and pen IN-YO-FACE.  No bueno.    We finally order some gyoza, pork belly bowl and of course some ramen (Kuro).  Everything was delicious (4.5 stars), just make sure you are in for \"Kurume\" ramen which is the thicker and more flavorful broth.   Overall, we did not appreciate being rushed.  Would have rather been denied than felt like we had to hurry.  Totally unexpected from a restaurant with normally gracious employees.  However, the food made up for it and we will be back sometime...probably a long time but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious ramen, friendly staff, good portions for price. Pork is melt in your mouth good! It's small but only 3 tables were occupied. By the time we got our meals, the whole place was filled (except a few bar seats). We were in and out in about 20 minutes, we were hungry and they had super fast service. Not a place to sit and chat for hours, more of a quick fix."}
{"text":"Hooked on their Tonkotsu ramen. It is in the same plaza as QQ BOBA, so it's perfect as Chara Monta has best authentic japanese ramen in town, and QQ boba has best Taiwanese style fresh milk teas in town!"}
{"text":"It's really hard finding Asian food that's not in China Town. I've gone to Monta Chaya exactly 3 times.  Each time, I've been very underwhelmed. It was good, but just mediocre to me. It loosely fills that ramen craving I have from time to time, since its the closest restaurant to me.   I've had the black garlic, regular tonkatsu, and spicy miso ramen. Add egg.   I was a ramen fiend for some time and explored the noodle houses of LA -- this would stack somewhere in the middle. Not the best, but not the worst.   The flavors are there, noodles are al dente and chewy, soft boiled egg is perfect.... I guess my only gripe is that the broth is TOO rich for me. Now, I understand some people love the richness and fattyness... and some seek it, then you'll love this! But for me, it was just too much and a bit overly salty -- made my stomach feel unsettling a bit. I have had ramen which tasted rich but didn't FEEL rich... I actually had to add some vinegar into the broth to try and cut the fat.   All in all. This is A-Ok."}
{"text":"Japanese food is one of my favorites. However, I've never been a Japanese ramen fan (I prefer udon). So why am I giving Monta, a ramen place, such a high rating? I go there for their deee-licious fried rice, pork belly bowel and chasu buns, which I'm addicted to. It's great they're on Eastern Ave. now. I did try their ramen a while back on Spring Mountain, but it didn't change my mind about ramen. Looking forward to getting some more chasu buns!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this ramen house. I am a little biased because I have had better ramen than this. However, their flavors are average. I am used to real ramen cooked by adorable Japanese chefs in the back of their shop (awesome example santouka ramen in Orange County is who ramen shops should aspire to- Zagat rated) like santouka in California. One huge complaint is their pork belly, lots of flavor and melts in your mouth BUT had bone fragments- that's a lawsuit waiting to happen when you chip a tooth. Their staff is friendly but always in a rush. And honestly I didn't taste any difference between their clear broths and milky. This place is good, if you need a ramen fix."}
{"text":"As a long-time patron of the Spring Mountain location, I was elated to see they were opening a location on my side of town. I was hopeful that quality wouldn't dwindle like it does with other restaurants opening multiple locations. I was not disappointed! I ordered my usual Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen! It tasted like genuine Monta ramen. Yes!!!! It was nice to see they added a few more options to the menu while keeping in the simplistic Monta fashion. I look forward to trying the new offerings very soon. Gyoza and Kimche were great as expected.   It appears that there are a few more tables available than at their first location which is good. They spared no expense with the interior. We got there just as they were opening the shop and the place filled fast. If the waiting list sheet is any indication, I assume there is a wait here as well so be ready to relax. Browse Japan Creek next door and enjoy the cultural exchange."}
{"text":"I was excited to try their Veggie Ramen. Ive been to their other location on Spring Mtn. And really not the best ramen but i wanted to try the Veggie Ramen. I went in and sat at the counter but I was told told get back and sign in. No big deal, 2 minutes later it's ok to seat at the same counter. Took about 5 min to take the order.  8 min later, server said No Veggie Ramen and I should call first before coming next time. Just wasted 15 min waiting plus driving here to try their only Veggie Ramen that they don't have.  Hope others have better experience."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding.  It was clean and comfortable inside.    I knew going in there that its a noodle/ramen house.  Even knowing that, I was disappointed in the noodles themselves.  I got a salad and ate some gyoza--which were both delicious.    The deal with the noodles -- the broth wasn't flavorful and I didn't care for the texture.  Also, and this was my biggest peeve, was that I ordered extra slices of pork on top of the noodles.  They were paper thin, flavorless, and disintegrated upon contact with chopsticks."}
{"text":"Great place for a bowl of ramen.  If you are on the east side of Vegas, this is the place. Service is quick and pleasant. Noodles are cooked to perfection. Broth is excellent. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The hype is real, their ramen is amazing. Get the tonkotsu and ask for extra chashu. Get the chashu buns as well. Very busy place, be prepared to wait if it's lunch or dinner time and you have a big party. Oh and right next door is the amazing Japan Creek Japanese grocery so I like to get my groceries there too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ramen noodle bar in Las Vegas!  Period!  Best food, Best Service, Reasonably cheap, clean, and good location.  Highly recommend!  Order the black Garlic oil infused Ramen noodle bowl which is real tasty,  gyoza, and the kimchee fried rice with pork.   Also good vegetarian offerings here."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place in all of Las Vegas. We love it.   I was very tempted to try the cold noodle today being that it's over 100...but the miso ramen is just too good. Maybe next time I'll venture out of my comfort zone.   Miso ramen about 7 bucks, add egg for an additional 1.5 and you have perfection.   Always quick seating, welcoming service and delicious food :)   Oh and if it's your first time, don't be alarmed when they all yell at you when you come and leave. I don't know what it means, but it's kind of nice to have everyone acknowledge you when you come and go!"}
{"text":"Placed was packed but we were able to sit within 5 mins.   I honestly didn't like the flavor of the ramen i ordered, bland. But my friend's soup was better and little bit spicy. I know pork has fats but our meat is mostly fats.   I also didnt like the rice cake appetizer i ordered, i had rice cakes before but not as tough to chew as this one although i liked the flavor of its toppings"}
{"text":"Love this place to death! Kimchi fried rice is my favorite dish, the pork is to die for"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet (just like Monta) . This place is spot on.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've tried nearly everything and haven't been disappointed.  The staff is always friendly and always busting their behinds to keep everyone happy.  There is usually a wait, sometimes hefty, but I look at that as a compliment to the establishment.  You gotta go here, I promise the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Monta Chaya....  You might wonder if the quality is as good as the original one.  The answer is YES.  It's actually to our Salon Luxy Nail Salon.  We are regular there, more like it's almost my 2nd kitchen LOL.  Monta Chaya offers more Appetizers than the original Monta.  5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"A lot of the people I talk to (about ramen at least) either really like or don't like Monta. It is a convenient restaurant because they have multiple locations, but I'm not the biggest fan. What I had was their tonkotsu shoyu ramen with thick noodles; personally, their broth is a tad on the saltier side and not as creamy as I would like it to be. The flavors in it are mediocre, and there is nothing memorable about it. Though I do credit them for making their noodles well, where they have a nice bite to them."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've ever had. It is so rich and savory and delicious. I've heard their fried rice is really good too, but I can't resist getting the ramen every time I've been here. I've had the Tonkotsu, Tonkotsu Shoyu, and the Miso... I think the Tonkotsu is my favorite but they're all really delicious. Definitely add the marinated egg! Yum!"}
{"text":"Wasn't my favorite place for ramen to eat. It is super busy and small place. The waitress are in a rush to get you in and out, I asked a question about the egg, waitress had an attitude and replied, no they half cooked. The cooks are organized and seem to have a great system down. I had the Tonkotsu. I would like to try another dish."}
{"text":"I love this place and go whenever I can. I always get the miso, calamari, and dikon salad. The miso is a little salty, but that's why I love it so much. The place is small but cozy and the staff is always nice."}
{"text":"Great place for Monta Ramen and you don't have to hightail it to the Monta on Spring Mountain, if you need a ramen fix.  I normally order the tonkatsu with spring onions for an add on and a side of Kimchi. I've never had a bad bowl of ramen here, it's always great. I'm sure that's the reason it can get crowded. I think the longest I have waited was 15 minutes. I normally go at noon and there are two of us, so we get seated right away. If you can, opt to sit at the bar as there are usually open seats there.  The restaurant is pretty narrow, think NY size, but the seating is worked to where you won't be sitting on top of people. The service is fast so you won't wait long after you order. That comes in handy, especially if you are super hungry. The servers are nice and attentive, no problem there."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. Food was good -- the ramen was not overly salty like all the other places I've tried (especially at shoku ramen and also ramen sora). Great flavor without mounds of salt. Got the Karaage (fried chicken) which was just ok- not great but loaded that chili oil on it and I finished my plate. The shishito peppers were yummy too. Service was friendly but I felt rushed even though we were there past the dinner hour and no one was waiting for a table. Ambiance was nice (which is saying a lot for vegas). Will return."}
{"text":"I love ramen!!! Both Monta chaya and the Monta in Chinatown are probably my favorite ramen spots in Vegas. I've had ramen sora, tetsu, fukumimi but Monta has the richest and tastiest broth of them all. The chashu pork is also very delicious. I like to order the kuro ramen which has a garlic based broth with thick wavy noodles...very very good. The broth does start to taste salty towards the end but the flavor just does not disappoint. The chaya location in Henderson is much more comfortable and spacy compared to the Chinatown spot. Monta always hits the spot! :)"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. I heard so many good things about the place and I just did not like it at all. I couldn't finish my bowl. The only part I liked about the shoyu ramen was the egg that I added. My friend also had to drown his miso ramen in some spicy sauce. After searching and finally finding a place that has chicken broth I am left speechless. It took a lot out of me to write past the \"thoroughly disappointed\" part."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, clean, fresh and cheap. Everything I want in a Ramen place. The best ramen in Henderson."}
{"text":"It's pretty tasty ramen and all the other things are pretty good too. The hot tea is served in cans, which is interesting. Service is usually on point and the kimchee is also yummy. It's not a terribly comfortable restaurant, though. I'm in opinion, it could use some cushions on the benches and perhaps add a bench (and heater, if it's cold) outside for people waiting so that people don't wait on top of other people."}
{"text":"This is likely to become a regular favorite for me any my sons. Good food, great price... wish they had some more seating."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out. I came once with a friend for lunch but there was a 30min wait so we ended up going somewhere else. It took me awhile to come back because I'm not very familiar with these Japanese noodle restaurants. Had it once in Hawaii but it wasn't anything special to me. I had a 5 star rating going on this review before the food came. EXCELLENT service. The waitress was very informative and helped me figure out what I wanted. The soup was alright but again nothing special to me. Maybe because I grew up eating top ramen 5 days a week  The pot stickers had a funny taste to them so I only ate 2. I would order the soup again but not the pot stickers. It tasted fine but I had to go get tacos after I ate there because the bowl of soup wasn't very filling. Very small nice little spot. No wonder it's always packed though, there's only room for about 20 people in there at a time. Would be a 2 or 3 star rating if it weren't for that great service."}
{"text":"Came here during dinner, ordered tonkotus ramen, miso ramen and fried calamari. Service was mediocre, food was not bad, bit salty. Overall experience was okay.   Good -ramen soup was very creamy. -corn tastes good with soup. -better than their original location.   Not so good -charges 1 dollar for Sriracha. -server was not friendly. -fried calamari became soggy due to sauces on the bottom, ramen soup is bit too salty."}
{"text":"This place is delish! If you are craving good ramen, you should definitely check them out. Their kimchi fried rice is so fresh and yummy, and I definitely recommend the spicy tonkotsu. Service is fast and friendly and the spot has a nice relaxing ambiance. Definitely a hidden gem as I did not know about this place before a friend suggested and I searched yelp reviews. It's sometimes hard to find a good ramen or sushi spot outside of Chinatown, but this one is definitely the beez kneez."}
{"text":"Very good ramen, and fried rice. We always ask for less salt in the ramen because it's very salty for our taste. Excellent service. A+"}
{"text":"This was my old ramen spot. It was always good every time I came here."}
{"text":"This is the closest ramen place to my home so my father and I go for a good fill of ramen and crispy rice. Usually I would get the miso ramen with extra egg but lately I've been seriously digging the pork belly bowl! The staff is very friendly and provide good service too."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place to go that's closest to my house. The casual ambiance in the place is awesome and the staff is super attentive.   My only request is that you add some chicken options to the menu. I'm not huge on pork but it still doesn't change my love for this place! If you are ever near by, stop by and grab an awesome bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We crave the ramen and it's pretty much our fav food place in Henderson. We always order to go so I'm not sure about the quality of service inside the restaurant but the staff is always friendly when I'm there to pick up. Our food is always ready within 15-20 min. Shoyu Ramen, gyoza and Kimchi fried rice is our go to meal. Every time the noodles are perfectly cooked, the pork is tender and the flavor of the bamboo shoots and green onions are perfection. The gyoza and fried rice never disappoint either, amazing flavors everytime. My husband ordered the chasu bowl this last time and wow so good!! I tell all my friends about this place and we will definitely continue to frequent Monta Chaya."}
{"text":"Small but fabulous place! Finally found the Ramen place we miss. You should come early so you will not have to wait for quite a while. I love the Miso Ramen here. Very tasty broth. Enjoyed the chashu bowl too."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a bit of a ramen connoisseur (if there ever was one), so if you are not too picky with ramen, don't take this review to heart.  Frankly, I was not impressed with the ramen here.  I ordered the shoyu ramen and had high expectations, as one of my friends said she LOVED the ramen here in Las Vegas.  The ramen was mediocre -- nothing worth raving over, but also nothing to complain about.  The value was fair, the amount of noodles and chashu was reasonable, and the broth was tasty.  You absolutely must add the nitamago to your ramen -- that was my favorite part!  I also ordered the gyoza, a side order of fried rice, and the crispy rice spicy tuna roll.  The gyoza was extremely fresh, however, I wasn't really a fan of it because it was a little soggy.  Be prepared to mix your own gyoza sauce, which is typical at a lot of ramen restaurants, but it can throw off unsuspecting guests sometimes.  The fried rice was DELICIOUS!  I enjoyed absolutely every grain of it, as I loved the sauce and the texture.  The crispy rice spicy tuna roll was also pretty good, as the fish tasted extremely fresh!  Everything we ordered was a great value for the price we paid.  The service was pretty great here!  We arrived for an early dinner - around 5:30 and were seated immediately.  The server was quick, warm, and accurate.  We even ordered the crispy rice roll as an add-on to our initial order, and it came in a timely manner.  Everyone was very friendly in this restaurant!  All in all, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend because the ramen was nothing special -- maybe an effective hangover cure, but nothing more.  The other items I ordered were delicious, but the main dish was underwhelming.  This is the first ramen restaurant I have tried in Las Vegas, so I will probably be trying out some of the other ramen restaurants before returning to this one."}
{"text":"Best ramen in US. I lived in LA, Philadelphia, Cleveland, San Antonio but this place is the best so far. I was in Vegas for my business trip, I went there two days in a row. Both times I ordered tonkotsu shouyu ramen. I guess there are a lot of Japanese people live in Vegas. The ramen wasn't Americanized. It was very authentic."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Ramen house I've been to so far.  I'm from California's Bay Area and we have plenty ramen houses there but none compare to the broth and noodle ratio in terms of flavour, chewiness, seasoning...i can just go on.   The place is small so be prepared to wait but it's so worth it.  I haven't had the fried rice so much so I can't speak for that but the ramen, the gyoza, the kaarage are all very very very good. As far as I'm concerned, this place is worth the drive from San Jose."}
{"text":"had very high expectations for this place since it's so highly rated, but i was rather disappointed.  had the tonkatsu ramen. so the depth of flavor of the broth is excellent. my issue, however, is how salty the broth was. why?? why so salty? i really have issues with ramen places where i can't finish the broth because it's too salty. i think if they can half the amount of salt they put in the broth, it'd be perfect. if they ever offer a low sodium version, i'll be back."}
{"text":"You know a place is going to be amazing when there is a line out the door. Once seated, this place did not disappoint from start to finish. The service was fast and the food was spectacular. To start I got shoshito peppers and pork buns. The pork buns were to die for, so good I ordered another round!!! The peppers were played with a sauce drizzled over them, at first I wasn't thrilled about this, but once I cleaned the plate off, it was clear I loved the dish. For the soup I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, Basic chicken broth with big noodles. I kept mine basic and only added pork and medium boiled eggs. Very simple, but very tasty. I can't wait to come back and try more items!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the veggie ramen. Soy milk based soup with corn, leek, tomato, radish sprouts and noodles. Pretty weird... But I LIKED it! I wish they offered tofu as an add-in.  Unfortunately I don't eat pork anymore but the ramen looked and smelled legit."}
{"text":"Yessss! Excited to find a ramen spot that isn't in Chinatown. Miso & tonkotsu ramen are both great choices. The crispy rice (spicy tuna) in town. Chicken karaage is light and not oily. Gyoza is flavorful and fired to order. Ask for Joseph- truly a great server who is passionate about great and attentive service."}
{"text":"You know that \"ramen-life\" (I just made that up!) is definitely good when you take that first delicious spoonful of Tonkatsu Ramen from Monta Chaya. The creamy silky texture combined with the almost overpowering combination of flavors that dance across your tongue for hours to come. It's nearly indescribable and therefore, if you are reading this, you are now bound and committed by all the power of Yelp, to try it yourself!  An essential part of the experience is the formal Japanese greeting when you enter, the decor, the tradition of the experience, and the formal goodbye when you leave. This is not soup in a bowl. THIS IS RAMEN. The real thing. The tradition. The excellence. The secrecy of the recipe and the multi-day preparation technique. The fact that no two purveyors off his delicious meal have the same approach, the same ingredients, the same exact technique. True ramen is a unique life event that must be experienced to understand and appreciate.   But, will we ever truly understand? Doubtful. Let's just agree to enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok,  I really really wanted to like this place.  I got the shoyu tonkatsu ramen and pork belly rice.  The pork in the ramen was awesome.  Now,  the broth was way too salty. Sorry!  I really was sad I didn't like it because so many peeps do. The pork belly rice was too saucy but the flavor was good.  Just in case I do really like the ramen at santouka. I mention this in case you question my review."}
{"text":"I can't count the amount of times I have eaten at this place. It is small and intimate, but they always seem to have seating available. Service is always prompt and very friendly. I always order the Shoyu Ramen with corn. I have cravings for this. I have tried mixing in some of the different condiments they have at the table, but I always go back to the basic. So delicious and filling. My husband's staple is the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen, he loves it. This place always gets it right, and we will continue to frequent here."}
{"text":"Yuck Yuck and another Yuck.  Two weeks ago, we decided to try this place out, but was unable to get in.  It was packed.  Figure Pack = good food.  Well, not necessarily.  We tried again today and were seated promptly.  My mom and I ordered a Gyzoga and each bowl of the Tonktasu.  Here is my review of the Ramen Tonktasu soup:  1.  Soup was bad bad bad.  I gave some to my 2 yr daughter who loves soup and she shook her head and did not want it.  It smells bad!  2.  Ramen noodles.  This is like Ramen from the bag.  Personally, I like the Ramen from the bag better.  3.  3 slices of pork??  seriously.  Hardly any meat.  It was 3 thin slice of fatty pork.  Yuck.  hello???  Verdict.  I would never recommend this to ANYONE.  It is not worth the wait.  I rather have a bowl of Pho that would cost about 7 bucks.  The Pho would have better noodles, better tasting soup, and more meat.  This place is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Only wish they had more seating.  When choosing between an expensive dinner or Monta Chaya, we chose this small noodle house.  The broth is why I keep coming back.  Everything we have had is excellent. I'm always sure to get the kimchi."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Monta Chaya over 15 times. Today on a cool rainy Vegas day I opted to get the Chashu Buns which I have had in the past & were excellent. Today they were very sadly disappointing. I super thin slice of pork on the bun with a tiny piece of lettuce that didn't even cover the pork. Sauce on it didn't seem to be what it used to be either. Sadly disappointed I paid $5 for that as it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"First time eating at Monta Chaya today for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised!   First off the establishment - wayyy better than the original Monta! Restaurant is clean and more spacious, however I can see this place possibly getting a bit tight during busy times. There's also more parking space in this location.   The food - my mom and I ordered Tonkotsu ramen (her order was less salty, which i liked way better..!) and a small pork belly bowl. Both were very yummy and taste similar to the broth at the original Monta. However, you still can't choose how you want the noodles cooked (reason for minus one star).  Servers were attentive and quick to refill our drinks.   I'm definitely going to make repeat visits at this place! :)"}
{"text":"They NEVER answer the phone!! NEVER!!!  Called for 20 minutes to place a to go order.. Finally went down to place the order, tried asking the waitress how long of a wait it would be for a to go order \" her response was uh I Don't know... \" then she walked away AND NEVER came back to take our TO GO order.. They have Completely lost our business!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here as we were visiting Vegas. We came right when they opened for lunch and were one of the first people, it quickly filled up fast. The service was good, food came out fast. We ordered kaarage, Chashu buns, two tonkatsu ramens with eggs and extra Chashu pork belly on the side. The appetizers were good. The ramen not so much...sadly. The broth is salty, the more you ate it the saltier it seemed. I also felt like the broth wasn't hot enough, I like my soups hot. The good thing was that the Chashu was very soft and tender which we loved! If they made their broth less salty and more creamy it would of been great!"}
{"text":"This little Japanese Ramen house was packed and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table at lunch. The ramen was excellent and very filling. The gyoza is also very good. You do have to make your own sauces to dip it though. I'd recommend a bit of the soy sauce, a splash of vinegar, the hot oil and a spoonful of the minced garlic. Delicious! Also, don't forget to add a spoonful of garlic to the ramen! It can be a bit salty, so drink plenty of water."}
{"text":"Craving pork belly?  Is it a Friday night and you need your Monta fix but don't want to travel across town to Spring Mountain?  Oh yes, it's true!  Monta Chaya opened last week and it's just like home (aka Spring Mountain).  Well, kinda.  It's even better with new menu items!  No spoiler alert... you've got to visit to check it out for yourself.  As far as your favorite menu items - yep, they're there!  My favorite is the pork belly bowl - it was beautifully prepared with tender, juicy pork belly over slightly sticky white rice served with pickled ginger.  Succulent.  The guys did their regular thing:  miso ramen with egg, chashu prok, and nori and tonkotsu ramen with egg and I can't remember what else.  We were all stuffed and well fed and well taken care of in our East-side Monta.  We're so glad you're here!"}
{"text":"The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to.   As with the other noodle houses, this place has  table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.  Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.  The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up.   There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full.   The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.   Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite. The staff here is prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Monta Chaya is like the younger, sexier sister of Monta Ramen. Anything Monta Ramen can do, Chaya can do better.  I stopped here during the week of grand opening with my home skillet Molly T. The restaurant is much more open and spacious than its sister restaurant. The decor is simple yet modern and tasteful. The stools at the bar no longer anally penetrate your behind; they now have larger stools with rectangular cushions on top.  In addition to the standard ramen menu offered at Monta Ramen, here they offer you additional \"Chaya\" menu consisting of various appetizers ranging from chicken karaage to daikon salad to chasu buns to several other things in between.   The ramen menu is identical including the add on options. I went with my tried and true Tonkotsu Shoyu (soy and pork bone based broth) ramen with extra corn. The taste was every bit as good as the original location's. The noodles were cooked well and had great texture, the broth was milky and packing flavor, two pieces of chashu were solid quality and not overly fatty, and the standards that included dried seaweed, green onion, and kikurage mushroom completed the great taste.   I saw one of the cooks from the original location working in the kitchen, so it is no surprise that the taste seems consistent. The service was okay, toward the end the waitress kept hovering behind us as to hurry us along. The prices are reasonable...I think my bowl came to $7.45 with the add on. Definitley great value for both quality and quntity of ramen."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen and overall menu. Good service. Very consistent quality. My go to ramen spot!"}
{"text":"Monta Chaya's ramen is my favorite.  The fried rice is so good.  It's hard to order takeout on a busy evening."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for lunch when you need some warming broth to fight a cold. You can add some seaweed or kimchee for a nice little touch.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Black garlic oil ramen is the bomb....much better than the north location....little to no wait...broth is silky and rich...awesome"}
{"text":"Finally tried the \"real ramen\" that everyone raves about and loved it! I had the  Shoyu Ramen. It was basically glorified ramen noodles that you can buy from the store, but better because it was fresh and had veggies on top. The portion sizes were very filling and the service was very friendly and quick.  My favorite thing about the restaurant is they played my favorite 90s music!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent cooked noodles, clean place, tasteful decor, fast service, great portions, and reasonable prices!! I am so happy my friend took me here to eat. Will be frequenting this place- a LOT!"}
{"text":"The food was great however the service was very slow.. I just ate here a couple minutes ago and had to wait more than 20 minutes to get our food. Not only my table but about 5 tables were waiting on their food along with a line of people waiting to eat. Maybe it's just rush hour. But if that's the case, if you're wanting to eat something right away, don't go here at that time."}
{"text":"I ate at Monta Chaya the other week. It was about 35 minutes before closing and the place was still packed and it wasn't even the weekend.  Service was great. Despite being crowded we were seated really quickly. The servers were quick to take our orders.  I had ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. It included mushrooms, scallions, a hard boiled egg and charsui. It was delicious! What made the dish so great was the pork broth. It was so flavorful and balanced.  Prices were comparable to other Ramen shops. I will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they have a monta here in henderson!! I usually get the tonkatsu ramen and added an egg. Very delish as always! Service was great and we received our food in the right amount of time. We also sat at the bar, which was cool to see them cooking all the food. Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"So good! I was never into ramen until I found this place! Sooo so good I recommend everyone go here! Delicious and its so cheap! A must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great little location in Henderson for authentic Japanese Ramen. The Tonkotsu ramen with boiled egg and extra pork belly is my favorite. This location is pretty clean and the service is very fast. The staff is very friendly and food prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya is my go to spot for ramen in the Vegas Valley.  The staff is friendly, the interior is decorated well, it's clean and the food is good.  Honestly though the main reason this place is my go to is because it is located close to my house. Other ramen places I also like to go to are a bit of a drive for me. As for the ramen itself, I get the Tonkotsu Ramen and sometimes I will get the spicy version where they add a little bit of spicy sauce for you to stir into the ramen.  The ramen here is quality and what you expect ramen to be. The soup is strong, concentrated, fatty and a bit salty. It isn't the best that I've had in town but I do just happen to keep coming back. I personally prefer the thin wavy noodles, and the pork they serve here is well cooked but isn't gonna blow your socks off. It's just a solid and well balanced bowl of ramen where one aspect of it doesn't outshine any of the others. I have had a few of the appetizers and they are pretty standard. Calamari, pot stickers and fried rice are all good and worth paying for but won't be the reason you come back. People go for the ramen for sure. I come to this place because the ramen is solid and the staff are on point. If I am willing to drive a bit further though, I will going elsewhere for ramen that night."}
{"text":"Very good!!!!!!  The crispy rice was my FAV!!!!  The soup was large and warm and way better then ones i have tried before.... i got mine spicy and was well worth it, even though i had to add a lot more of the spices provided on the table to get it to a temp that i emjoyed.  Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw someone share a post on Facebook and we were on our way home from the doctor so we stopped in. WOW. I am not a big fan of Ramen so we ordered some other dishes.  The Chashu Buns, were awesome. Best Gyoza best I have had. Not doughy at all. Daikon salad was light and refreshing. Crispy rice with creamy spiced tuna not real spicy, perfect and my favorite. Karaage, Japanese fried  chicken yummie, not greasy. This place will be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I love the Monta Ramen on Spring Mountain.   Friends told me about the location on Eastern.  I went Friday night and it was as good as the Spring Mountain location.  A bit bigger and not quit as fast.... but, the food was spot on.  If you can't make to Spring Mountain for your ramen fix.  Hit Eastern!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen, excellent wait staff. It's small, yes, but definitely worth it. I really liked our waiter, he was funny, chatty but not overbearing, just a cool dude sharing his noodle love with us. He also poured a perfect pint, respect. The ramen is tasty, I did not find it overly salty, and it's reasonably priced. I ordered tonkatsu with egg added, and they have chili oil at the table, and this was a winning combo. I didn't need extra noodles, got full on the standard order. A must try in the area, heck, a must try in the Valley."}
{"text":"Excellent service....Joe totally was a huge part of this hole experience....It is my first time eating Ramon.....I am so lucky I waited for the best....The gyoza are absolutely perfection... Tender....Well seasoned.... The Ramon is rich...Full of flavor.....You can taste the bone marrow.... Unbelievable..... Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Delicious food, cool little place, friendly staff, open kitchen and clean. Will be back for sure! Thank you"}
{"text":"Man this place is fucking good!!! The cooks are really cool to talk to. And Joseph is the best waiter in the world . Sandro makes the best ramen , definitely check this place out (X"}
{"text":"Ramen broth and noodles were mediocre. The Takara fried rice tasted unusual--threw it away. I would not recommend this place. If you want authentic really good ramen, you should go to Ramen Sora. The noodles are flown in from Japan and the broth is very rich and delicious. The fried rice and gyoza are also extremely good."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Only because my Tonkotsu broth was too salty.  We ate at the Monta in Chinatown last yr and this place opened about 1 yr ago.  I prefer this place because there's better parking as it is located in a small mall area and the facility is nicer. We came for a late lunch at 2PM and avoided the lunch crowd.  Got seated immediately.  Service is nicer here too.  We shared a large pork belly rice.  My cholesterol was probably off the roof eating this dish but it was so good with lots of pork belly. I added corn, egg to my Tonkotsu which was also good but found the broth to be too salty and couldn't enjoy it.  Hubby added an egg to his Tonkotsu ramen. Our lunch bill came to $31 which isn't too bad for 3 dishes.  He took the leftover pork belly rice home and had it for breakfast the next day and didn't share!"}
{"text":"Yup, the best ramen joint hand down. I seriously dont go anywhere else when I want to eat ramen because they are so consistently great! Although sometimes there may be a long wait to get into this small restaurant, its worth it! My favorite part about it is that it isnt too salty here. I've gone to many ramen places and the broth would come out way too salty for my liking, and I know ramen is naturally a salty dish, but Monta makes it just right! The service is always really good and I always leave full and satisfied. I've tried the shoyu, tonkotsu and the kuro ramens and each were very flavorful! Recommend them all. I also love adding corn and and nori to my order, plus a side of their yummy fried rice!! :)"}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim because we were across the street, but I'm glad we found this place! :)   If you've been in the LA area and have been to Shin Sen Gumi Ramen....the layout of this place is EXACTLY the same...only in a larger space. I had the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen and my dad had the Miso Ramen and both of us thought the broth was super salty :( gotta knock a star for that. Portion and food quality wise, everything was great! I'll definitely come here again! Shop was clean, prices are great, and menu is super simple. We also ordered the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice and they made that fresh for us too :)   Service could use big improvement though. There were only 2 tables, including us, when we stopped in and service was still super slow with 2 (wtf?!) servers."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya needs to finish remodeling their kitchen....I'm going through ramen withdraws."}
{"text":"I love ramen, like I really really like this stuff. Growing up in Southern California I was lucky to have exceptional ramen within 40 minutes of me. That being said as the weather gets cooler you have no idea how much I appreciate having a wonderful ramen restaurant near me. I have been to many ramen restaurants in Las Vegas and this is by far my favorite. The broth here is perfect. The noodles are always perfectly cooked, and their sides and condiments are great. Service here is always so patient and kind, which is appreciated since they are always packed (another tell-tale sign of a good restaurant). The wait can be long so come prepared to put your name on a list and then either grab a boboa near by, poke into the Japanese market (which is also wonderful), or hook yourself up to your smart phone/device. They also have some delicious starters such as their shishito peppers and crispy rice with spicy tuna. I took a few co-workers here, and they easily accommodated the vegetarian in our group."}
{"text":"The first time I pulled up to Monta Chaya there was a line out the door.  This is the sign of good food.  And so I stuck it out.   Once inside we were seated at the bar and immediately given friendly service.  I had the Spicy Tonkatsu ramen with extra pork and an egg added.  The broth was delicious.  And the spice was perfect.  This is two utensil food, you'll need to be handy with chopsticks and a spoon to fully enjoy its delicious, messy, slurpy goodness.  They also have several small salads and appetizers to choose from if you bring someone with you who isn't into ramen.  But I'd recommend encouraging them to try it - this isn't Top Ramen.  It isn't watery soup.  It is some of the most flavorful broth and meat you'll taste.  I used to hear people saying, \"Ramen is life\".  I never understood it.  At least that is until I set foot into traditional style ramen houses like this one.  Monta Chaya is a cozy and beautifully designed ramen house tucked into a strip mall.  The atmosphere is very authentic, despite the strip-mall location.  Head inside and expect to sit arm to arm with fellow ramen-eaters because this place is usually busy and for good reason!  Highly recommended due to quality, authenticity, and location."}
{"text":"Food was bomb! Don't forget to toss some minced garlic on your fried rice!! Holy moly."}
{"text":"I waiver between 3 and 4 stars for this spot. It's in a strip next to a Japanese market. It's tiny. It's also a popular spot. So be prepared for a wait if you are coming for dinner. (Tip: Arrive before 6:30pm.)  Everything seemed very authentic, which was nice. The menu is kept simple, mostly ramen and fried rice, plus a few other small plate options.  We started with a salad that had a nice dressing, but was rather unremarkable. We then had the pork ramen and kimchi friend rice. They also have a soy ramen, a chicken ramen, and a pork/chicken combo ramen. They also have spicy and black garlic options. I liked how the broth here was a bit thicker than other ramen places. The pork also seemed to be better. The kimchi fried rice looked nothing like the picture on the menu and wasn't spicy at all. But it was some tasty friend rice. Portions were large enough to share. Prices are quite reasonable.   Service was seriously lacking. Think you might want water later or another beer? Better order it at the very start. Your server will only come to table twice - one time to take your order (order everything at once) and one time to bring the check (you will feel rushed). Or so was the case on the day we went.  I would probably have still given this place 4 stars for the authenticity and tastiness. However, my friend and I spent all night with some seriously grumbly tummies. And holy gas! We both had some major loud and smelly terrible farts! So while it might be some tasty ramen, it's not totally worth the after effects. I don't particularly like to enjoy my ramen that way. And we didn't have that experience with other ramen places."}
{"text":"Monta has a special place in my heart for being the best japanese ramen in vegas.  The only I didnt like about the original location on Spring Mountain is that there is always a wait. Then one day while browsing through yelp I noticed that Monta had indeed opened one on my side of the town.  From what I can tell the broth taste the same as the original location and there is never a line.  I have been here multiple times at different hours and never had to wait.    The place is just as small as the original location but the decor is nicer since it is newer."}
{"text":"Great ramen in several varieties.  Friendly and fast service.  Not terribly impressed with the other menu choices, so four stars vs five.    Smaller restaurant and it gets very crowded so arrive early or be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so.     Recommended."}
{"text":"This was closed for a few weeks back in March for remodeling. Now I come in, it looks exactly the same with no difference than before...Not even a speck of paint. What the heck?   Again another salty bowl of Tonkatsu. At $6.95 just two thin slice of pork belly meat and a whole bowl of noodle. Yesire, you would have to add $1.50 for an egg. That's $8.40 plus tax. If you want spicy tonkatsu than it would be $7.95. I have always wondered if I order tonkatsu then request some chili, will they give it to me? Add black garlic it will be $7.95 but some restaurant they have free garlic paste. Why can't I order a regular bowl than you me garlic paste and chili as condiments?"}
{"text":"I have tried the hot ramen and the cold noodles here and they are delicious. The prices are just right and the service is always impeccable. It is as if they took Monta Ramen and placed it right in the middle of Henderson. The appetizers are not too bad, we tried the crispy rice and that one, I could live without since the flavor was overpowered by the spicy tuna and the texture was strange as it was getting stuck in my teeth."}
{"text":"Their ramen is very good! They go head to head against Daikokuya (in LA) as my favorite ramen place.   I love adding extra pork slices to it. But you can add much more items if you like. My friend tends to load hers up like crazy.   Their kimchi fried rice is also really delicious! I tend to get sick of the pork belly bowl much quicker than the other dishes but still good regardless."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite ramen houses in town. They have delicious food at great prices! My wife and I both ate ramen with an appetizer for under 25$! What a steal!  We started with karrage appetizer, it was a bit plain. I wish they had some sort of dipping sauce to go with it. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen, it was very good but to be totally honest it wasn't even close to being spicy. The ramen itself was very delicious cooked to perfection. My wife had the miso ramen, and she too enjoyed it.   This is a very good ramen place, expect to wait to be seated as its always busy, as soon as the door opened at 5 it was already full. If you're around the area stop in for some ramen, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service, great food!!  We come so often the waiter recognizes us. If you want great ramen at a good price come here."}
{"text":"Yum!! With a line always out the door I often wonder why they choose to close between 2:30-5pm. I would bet if they stayed open they would have solid business throughout and people like myself, who can't take long lunch breaks, would eat here all the time. I'd eat here every day if I could get in and out in 30min! Onto the food... The ramen is on point!! The chashu is rich and buttery, the noodles taste fresh and have nice bite to them, the tonkatsu broth is creamy, rich, and so flavorful. Some of the best ramen I've ever had. Service is quick and very friendly. The chashu buns were a hit with my kids. The sauce was a little spicy for my younger child but fine for the older.  If you're looking for great ramen, Monta is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Wow!   Nice find!  We ordered several dishes, as we do when we try a new restaurant.   Every dish was fresh, hot and delicious.   The staff was professional yet friendly.  The place itself was clean and efficient.  When we walked in the place was full so we sat at the counter.   Great place as our order was passed  to us as it was cooked.  Suuuuper!   Recommend for excellent food and at a reasonable priced."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite ramen place in town.    In term of ambience and service, I would give a 5 stars. The decor is nice, staffs are friendly and humble. For foods, the calamari is so great, i believed the dipping is the same one using with shrimp tempura which was really go along well. The Tonkatsu ramen is tasty. The soup is so smooth and blended. The portion is a little too less for me, but it is okay. Overall, i was really impressed with this place and i will be back!"}
{"text":"Previous to Monta Chaya, my expertise in the ramen area was limited to Maruchan-branded ramen - the kind that comes in a small package for a very reasonable price at your local grocery story or convenience stop.  Now, while I consider myself very proficient with the Maruchan ramen and have become a master of its varied cooking styles, Monta Chaya certainly brings real, honest, Japanese ramen to the table.  I've now been to this place twice with the same friends and each time was a great experience.  Both times I ordered the shoyu ramen and it did not disappoint.  The broth is simply delicious and is not greasy.  The pork... oh, the pork.  It's a little slice of oink heaven - it literally melts in your mouth.  Nitamago was the extra choice for both because it is so extraordinarily delicious.  Go ahead and try it - you'll love it.  (Well, unless you don't like eggs.  Then don't.)  The first time I ordered extra green onions, which wasn't the best choice.  It hid the ramen and didn't mix in well due to taking up too much space.  The second time I added the nori seaweed sheets and that mixed in a bit better.  I stirred them about and let them absorb some of the delicious broth and it was indeed a delicious mixture.  We ordered the crispy rice the first time we visited and it was also tasty!  My last visit I was really tempted to order the fried rice, but it just seems wrong to do that at a ramen shop.  Maybe I'd feel less bad if I got it to go.  My noodles on my second visit were seriously al dente, almost to the point where it was unenjoyable.  I stirred my bowl a bit and just dealt with it since everything else was so yummy.  The service seems a little hit and miss, especially for as tiny as this place is.  Servers are always nice, though.  Had a bit of a complication with my last visit but ended up getting it sorted out.  Bonus for being next to Japan Creek Market!"}
{"text":"So good!!!! My husband and I have come here twice in less than a week. We have fallen in love with their pork belly bowl. It reminds me a lot of a yoshinoya beef bowl but way better! :)"}
{"text":"i must say that this monta, on the southeast side of town, is a million times better than the original monta. it's so surprising that 2 businesses run by the same owners could be so very different. one of the things that i find most aggravating about businesses in inconsistency.  dining here is actually quite enjoyable. the service is always very pleasant, even during busy times. one never feels rushed to hurry up and eat, unlike the other monta where it feels as though you're putting them out just by walking through the door. i have a few dietary restrictions but the servers here are always so accommodating which is refreshing.  the soup and noodles are still not piping hot here which i find to be the only consistent thing across the two monta's. the noodles are still not my favorite and the soup is still WAY too salty for my taste. the cold noodles, however, i'm a huge fan of.  if i lived closer, i would definitely dine here more frequently. it's a solid ramen shop with good service."}
{"text":"An excellent place to have a delicious bowl of ramen. They also have many other tasty dishes to choose from if you're not necessarily in the mood for noodles.  There will often be a wait around meal times, but if you are a little patient the servers are friendly and prompt. You will have a good time here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! If your looking for a quick sit down place to eat for lunch this is the place the food is so delicious best calamari different but yummy !!"}
{"text":"Still too date my first Ramen experience in Vegas was at Monta Ramen so going too Monta Chaya brought back found memories. I hardly go too Monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait. When you have Ramen Sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better. Few and far between see Monta. Monta Chaya brought back all the things I first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands. The shoyu ramen broth LOVE it! I love the depth of flavor and the noodles are awesome. The gyoza now that is something sorely MISS. By far all the Ramen places in town been too few but truthfully not all. Monta gyoza is league by itself. I think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much flavor. I also had the kim chee fred rice as side. It was ono. Just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce. I am just happy that Vegas is blessed too add another great Ramen place in town. Now with so many locations not part of town in that find some good Ramen.  The biggest bonus about this location and if ever need my Monta fix for sure this is location I would go before the original. The food is the same at both locations. Just SO much nicer at Monta Chaya for obvious reason its brand new, LOT more spacious seating from tables too seating at the bar, and like the decor inside very much modern asian theme. The staff was friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all. They did great job of staying on top of our drinks and everything coming out in timing matter. So if in the area need your Ramen fix Monta Chaya is place too get some!!!"}
{"text":"Waaaay better than their original Spring Mountain location which can be attributed to a larger seating area, zero crowds and better service. You won't have to wait 45 min for a table here and your food will be out soon after the order goes in, especially because the servers here take your order with a tablet type device.  I've been to this location a couple times now and as always with Monta I typically get a Tonkotsu ramen or pork belly bowl. The broth in the ramen seems much better here than what I remember with the Chinatown location since it isn't as salty. The chasu pork is always juicy and buttery tasting and I wish they would give more than 2 pieces. The pork belly bowl is perhaps the best non-ramen option here since the pork is also juicy and full of flavor. They also have fried rice, gyoza and other goodies on the menu if you're not a ramen lover.  Everything on the menu is around the $7-8 range which makes this place very reasonable and affordable. Like other reviews have stated, you probably don't get as many toppings in your ramen as other spots around town, but at Monta's price point this is probably the best ramen you'll find."}
{"text":"My first time at this location.   I ordered Tonkotsu with thick noodles and added egg and corn.  I did not care for the seaweed that comes with it.  The soup was overall better than the one I had at the spring mountain location.  It was still too salty for my palette. I've had really amazing ramen... This just isn't one of them for me."}
{"text":"Finally, Monta has opened up on my side of town; no longer do I have to traverse the I-15 and hazard Desert Inn Road with all the wonky crazies that can't drive for squat, all just to gamble on whether I'll be seated immediately (22 seats) or get to wait outside with the throng of addicts like I'm outside a methadone clinic in the Tenderloin...  And to be quite frank, with ALL the Ramen joints popping up like hedgehogs in town, I'm almost over it....almost.  My first love is Monta, and I have a sweet spot for the food and the people who have been terribly authentic and hospitable. I have never had a bad experience there, and the food is on point!  And it's is soo damn close, I could stop by here almost everyday which is all too tempting.  It's right beside my Japanese food store, Japan Creek, (same owners) which happens to be right next to my gym!  Talk about pure evilness...  As of right now, there's no signage, so you'll just have to remember that it's next to Japan Creek; the most awesome Japanese food store in Vegas.  Albeit compact, they have the best produce for Japanese dishes, as well as Sushi grade fish, Pork and Beef sliced for Sukiyaki or Shabu Shabu.  All just another way to sidetrack me off my clean diet, but really, I only really workout so that I can eat the things I love....it's a build/destroy existential quagmire that I secretly believe adds an insensible depth of character...or I'm just difficult and stupid-whatevs...  As you walk in, it's definitely an airier, well designed space, more than the original- a Monta 2.0 if you will... With some nice design elements and a little more decoration, you still have the central Noodle Bar where all the action happens, with just a few more tables than its predecessor.  What's different is the enlarged waiting area right in the front that's effectively blocked off, there's nothing more annoying than trying to eat while you have the eyes of hungry customers drilling evil death eyes at your back for your seat.  My evil side takes over;  I take even more leisurely time to finish, carrying a long conversations about roman shades and Twilight... Yeah, I'm that guy... hate me but the anticipation makes the food taste much better, so I'm doing you a HUGE favor!  At Monta Chaya, the menu is little more expansive, along with your tradition Gyoza, there's actually an appetizer or two not traditionally served in a Ramen shop: you have some fried Calamari Rings, Chicken Karage and some Salads too.  An expanded menu is a welcome addition to the simple menu.  I always order a plate of Gyoza, and it's as much a mark of the restaurant as the Ramen.  I like to put a little Soy, hot Chili Oil and grated Garlic into my little sauce place and dip these suckers in and pop them whole.  I was surprised that they came out broken up, I usually expect them to be stuck together, as well, there wasn't that crispy, almost burnt crust that make that satisfying oral contrast with the juicy filling.  But the quality was excellent, just a little execution mishap.  As it has gotten really warm, I have a cut off for Ramen (it just gets my body temp. so hot I sweat like I took a shower with my clothes on).  But luckily, Monta serves up my favorite Summertime dish: the Hiyashi Chuka (Cold Chinese) - a broth-less dish, you have cold Chinese Egg Noodles with a choice of Sesame or Yuzu (Japanese Lime) Sauce with Toppings of: Chasu Pork, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Bean Sprouts, Shredded Cooked Egg, Kikurage (Wood Ear Mushrooms) and Memma (Bamboo Shoots).  This dish is perfect on a hot day, when you just want to eat something cool yet filling.  I love Sesame sauce like a beast, it's my go to for just about everything; dipping sauce, salad dressing you name it.  At first you may look at this dish and think, what the hell? Why am I eating a salad with these odd non salad ingredients?  And this isn't really Chinese is it?  Well, yes and no, kind of a Chinese/Japanese hybrid that, well, if you kinda of crave after you've had it a couple of times.    As usual, Monta Chaya did not disappoint, I loved the service and the food is always on par.  I will have to try the Ramen soon, I just have to hope for a cold night, which is rare for us in April!!   Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          5 Ambience:  5 Service:      5"}
{"text":"This Monta is slightly bigger than the one on Spring Mountain, and seems to have a bit more items on their menu (They have pork bao! I might try that next time). However, the taste/flavor of their ramen doesn't meet my expectations after being a regular at Monta Spring Mountain.   Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but not great. I would've given this place 4 stars... but, during my quest to devour all the ramen, i bit into something hard. Upon further inspection, it seemed to be a wood chip? It was dark brown in color, so it couldn't have come from my chopsticks (your typical wooden tan disposable chopsticks). My best guess is it was from a wooden ladle when they were dishing out the broth? I guess I shall never know. It was towards the end of my meal, so I just left it as is."}
{"text":"Monta ramen on spring mountain is by far the best ramen in town and I was excited to see that they have expanded. My favorite part about monta was that the menu was short and each dish was made with the highest quality and taste. With that being said I decided to make a stop to the new branch and I noticed they had added a few more items to the menu so I decided to try the pork bun. The pork was dry, smushed between lettuce, ketchup, and mayo. Needless to say it was gross, so I waited for my ramen but wasn't impressed. The broth was lacking in flavor, and the egg was way over cooked. I will definitely be sticking to my favorite monta spot in china town."}
{"text":"Delicious...  Small and quaint! Friendly and helpful staff.  Great menu with quality food. Pork belly bowl was amazing! Ramen is so yummy..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because of past visits and how good it's been.   Today it was kind of a miss for us. We get the tonkotsu shoyu which normally is so good. But this time the broth was kinda greasy and tasted funny. The pork had a weird flavor to it as well.  The fried rice is always soo good. Does it have crack in it? The pork and onions just so easy to eat. I wish the portion was bigger because it's so good.  Just because today the flavor was a little different in our soups. We will continue to come here we love this place."}
{"text":"\"Irasshaimase!\" - oh yeah, this is going to be some good ramen, I have a good feeling about this one.  The greetings are loud and welcoming from the entire staff of Monta Chaya. After doing a search for ramen on Yelp, I narrowed things down to a few and this was my first choice based on the menu.  The menu is simple and true to a few styles of authentic Japanese ramen - Tonkatsu, Shoyu or Miso. What truly drew me in was the claim of homemade Tonkatsu - pork bone soup simmered for hours.  We ordered one Tonkatsu with a seasoned egg and my wife the Spicy Tonkatsu with corn. So a small pork belly on rice.  Tonkatsu was spot on! Thick rich savory broth with thin ramen noodles and traditional Japanese ramen garnishes. The seasoned egg is awesome, runny with a firm delectable outer white and adds the perfect additional element to the soup.   The spicy Tonkatsu was not really spicy, more of a chili flavor. My wife agreed that the corn was not a good choice to add. I think the corn would be better on the miso.   Hello pork belly! The pork belly on rice was so good that we both agreed that it would make a stellar stand alone meal. The pork is soft and savory, the fatty juices flavoring the rice underneath and the pickled ginger on top the perfect compliment.  On the table is the full spread of condiments to make your ramen your own. I love the chili oil, sesame and chili powder with a dash of vinegar.  Slurp loudly to show appreciation for your ramen as done in Japan!   On the way out the door, the staff erupts in an enthusiastic \"Arigato Gozimashta!!!\"  We will be back, the miso looks amazing :)  Aloha!"}
{"text":"I really love their ramen when I order it less salty (say usume). I get the miso ramen usume style and add chasu pork and takana leaves. I also get a side of kimchi which tastes really good with the ramen. As an appetizer, I like the crispy rice which is topped with tuna tartar. The only con I would say is their pork is very fatty."}
{"text":"So you're craving some ramen from Monta but don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown or waiting a long time just to get in. Well good news Monta fans. They opened up another location and the wait isn't as crazy as the original location.  The location seems far especially if you're not in the area but really for the long waiting time at the original location you could still drive to this location, eat, and leave in less time, actually I did that once even stopped by the original location before I was told the wait was over an hour.  The menu are made up of a variety of ramen and non-ramen items. I haven't had any of their non-ramen items, cause it's a ramen place. For the ramen you start with one of 4 base ramen selections (tonkotsu, shoyu, tonkotsu shoyu, and miso) and then add extra items to it if you wanted (extra pork, egg, nori, corn, etc.) for an extra charge. The base ramen selections aren't priced to bad but adding more extras really does add up. Plus they have a $10 minimum for credit card so you might have to added extra items. I thought the shoyu and tonkotsu shoyu are very salt to my liking and so I don't ever order them anymore but the tonkotsu and miso with a lot of extra items added :) They even have a spicy tonkotsu and another ramen that is shown off the regular menu. Some might say taste are different from here and the original location but to me they taste about the same to me, even might like it here more.  Just in case you were wondering, here, I order my tonkotsu or miso ramen with extra pork, egg, corn, and some spices and shoyu I add in myself from the table. Not bad. It's a decent substitute when I can't make it to my favorite ramen place and if I added more it would be to much for a bowl of ramen.   The interior is nice and spacious compared to the original location. The parking situation here is a lot better also. Customer service and speed, besides the initial waiting time to get seated, is about the same.   I'm not a huge fan of Monta in general but I'll enjoy a bowl here now and then. A lot of people love Monta and say they're the best. I don't know about that. They're good but enough for a 3.5 from me."}
{"text":"Visit Monta often and each time is just as good as the last. In todays time its hard to find a place that is consistently good. If consistency is key then Monta is your place."}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen in town. I have gone on a search for the best and I always end up back here. You can add to the noodles too. I usually add corn and kimchi. I also like that they can make any of them spicy. I have to be in the mood for the spicy though because it is crazy spicy. If you want the soup a little spicy, they can also put it on the side for you."}
{"text":"Good ramen. This location is right near my house so it is a lot more convenient that monta in Chinatown. They get 5 stars on their charsu buns alone. They will change your life"}
{"text":"Monta Chaya has food as amazing as Chinatown sister property Monta Ramen, but without the long lines and drive to Spring Mountain Road. They greet you when you walk in, similar to a sushi bar. Clean, friendly. Delicious ramen broth/noodles/meat. My favorite is the Tonkotsu. One nitpick: I wish they would serve fountain drinks/fresh tea instead of canned cola and tea."}
{"text":"A few days ago we walked in exactly 1 minute before close. They still seated us and took our order no problem. Working in the food industry I know that's not a nice thing to do so we decided to take our food to go. They were quick, friendly, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Very good noodles i don't do pork asked for chicken but none was in the dish still great meal"}
{"text":"Our go-to-ramen place. Affordable and yummy! Pick-up/take out customer service is also good. The only thing is this place is small and easily gets packed that's why we haven't attempted eating in yet. Plus the release of pickup order takes awhile. Even if you call ahead you still have to wait for them to prepare your order. Regardless I still like Monta Chaya and I will continue to order pickup from them."}
{"text":"This is not an actual review but monta Chaya is closed due to construction until 3/31/17   imagine the pain I was in... NO RAMEN  FOR ME"}
{"text":"I came here a few nights ago, and it was a really cute small restaurant. It was a bit busy, I ordered the spicy shoyu ramen and added meat. it was very soggy and mostly fat. The broth was yummy and I think they messed up my order because it wasn't spicy at all. Overall, it's a good ramen place but I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"The ramen here is decent. Sometime the broth is a hit or miss. It can be very good one day and it can be very salty the next."}
{"text":"Small place... have to wait sometimes if you're there during busy hours.  Wait staff is super attentive most of the time.    Now for the ramen. Ramen is solid except for the Tonkotsu. I find it to be too thick of broth for my taste and makes me nauseous after I eat it. Some people like it like that.  I know Tonkotsu is supposed to be thick but this place does it thicker than most others I have tried. So due to that I do Shoyu when we eat here and it's great every time.    Gyoza is ok. Fried rice is on point. I wasn't a fan of the crispy rice but others seem to love it.  Overall this is a solid ramen joint and I'm glad it's right by my house when I crave ramen."}
{"text":"This was seriously the best. Food was amazing. The pork literally melted in your mouth. I added the egg to my ramen and the yoke made the broth even better. The staff was great. Fast, friendly, and courteous."}
{"text":"Pretty good Shoyu Ramen soup with the hot chili oil.  Gyoza Dumplings and calamari were tasty. Highly recommend this ramen restaurant!  It was busy, so be prepared for quite a wait."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to enjoy Monta Chaya five times now and can confirm that it is my favorite noodle restaurant.  Always delicious with generous ingredients, I enjoy stopping by for lunch and sitting at the counter."}
{"text":"Five stars for what it is - Simple menu, good food, clean.  Good service and friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"There's something soothing about having ramen on a cold night like tonight. For the first time, this place isn't as packed as it always is though we still had to wait a couple of minutes to have a seat available.   Their chicken karaage appetizer came in huge pieces but their presentation was a little plain. Other places would serve it with a little ginger salad on the side but theirs didn't. It was literally just the chicken, a little tomato, a shishito pepper and a lemon wedge. It tasted good which is why I always order it!   My best friend and I basically ordered the same thing, mine with many substitutes. Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen is my favorite! I'm personally not a fan on the bamboo so I had them take those out and substitute my thin noodles to the thick kind. I recommend you to get the thick noodles because it's more filling and it doesn't break as easily.  Not too expensive either. Our ramen was about $7-8 each and the karaage was $4-5. Not a bad price for a good dinner.  My servers name was Joe. He's super cookyyyyy! I love how he shares stories of himself and chats with you. He even told this guy next to me a tip about his beer. He said that if the bubbles or fizz was thicker than his thumb, it's not a good pour? I think that's what I heard. I'm not even sure what that means since I don't drink beer but it sounds like an expert tip. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've tasted! The service was also great! Gyoza were incredible! So were pork belly!"}
{"text":"Update number 2- I know this is my second up date and I'm a bad bad girl for doing so. BUT I had to let you guys know about this. I know most of you should have heard/seen the \"new\" menu for monta, and it is now out. They have a \"spicy\" ramen and a \"black garlic\" ramen. I came here for lunch and got the tonkatsu shoyu with the black garlic oil on the side.    OH MY GODS!!! Okay, I didn't use all of it because, I didn't want to over power the taste of the actual soup, but it added such a depth of flavor. For most who don't know what black garlic taste like it has a sweet, carmalized type taste and it still has a garlicy finish, it's so good and I recommend it :)."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen, the best I've ever had. =) Their cripsy rice sushi is also delicious. =) It's so neat to sit at the bar and watch all the hard work that goes into preparing the delightful food. =)"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Vegas! I use to live in Japan and this place reminds me of home. Great food and great service! Try the Tonkotsu Ramen and Pork belly bowl!"}
{"text":"2minutes from my house . This place will get you full for 6 bucks but taste better then all the other\"ramen\" places out there. Wish I could just live here and just eat all day and night and morning ...sorry getting carried away ,you get my drift"}
{"text":"Soup on a cold winter's night is just what the body needs.  I'd give Monta Chaya a solid 4.5 stars.  It's just like the original Monta over on Spring Mountain, but with a bigger space.  The food is great, the people are super sweet and friendly, and the prices are cheap!    That being said, they get super busy, especially during this time of year--expect a bit of a wait during peak eating hours.  At times, they can use a few more people serving--it's THAT busy.  Big parties are welcome, but with so many people coming in, it can take a little longer to get a big party seated together.  Just a thought to keep in mind.  Ordering to-go is also another great option.  They can cook it for you or you can prepare it at home for fresh tasting ramen in the comfort of your own home ;)"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried ramen. I'm hooked!!!! You need to try the spicy with kimchi added. Sticky rice was awesome."}
{"text":"I will go to Monta Chaya probably every time I go to Vegas from now on.  A ton of interesting dishes as well as some good strong staple dishes.  We got the cold noodles without meat (delicious), the mustard greens fried rice (awesome), and a salad that I honestly can't remember right now.    All the ramen dishes around us looked great and since this place is open pretty late (11pm) it was pretty packed at night."}
{"text":"Tried this place hoping it would be as good as Sora Ramen but I was very disappointed. The broth to me tasted a little burnt. Their spicy miso was basically just the miso broth with a spicy taste almost like a Korean paste? It was not as satisfying as I had hoped.  If you have never tried Sora Ramen, you should. Their broth is far better. Their customer service is fantastic. I don't think I'd try Monta again. It was just disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, spicy miso ramen with extra chasu & corn, chasu bao, & gyoza. All was excellent. Killer bao... it was a small dining area, with very little space  for to go people to wait. There was a waiting list, but it's worth the wait. I think Fukamini tan tan men ramen is superior but the apps were by far better. I highly recommend. Food was 4 1/2 but rounded down for tiny dining area & wait."}
{"text":"There was 9 parties before us. I was concerned about the time after waiting for 20 min to get my 16 year old to her job. We placed our order to go. Our table got called after we placed our to go order,  I asked \"Yuki\" the hostess to shift our order to dine in since our table came up- \"your order is getting bagged now.\" We waited 12 more minutes- yes we are freaks we were on a time frame so we were timing every second, 12 min, after yuki says your order is getting bagged our to go order was finally ready! 3 more tables were seated in that 12 min. Why did you not just let us sit yuki when I had 2 children with me, when our table came up and we had ample amount of time to receive our food that had not even been bagged yet.  When I asked for yukis name the 2 other servers did not want to give it.  I do not care how good the food is. If the service is not good, nothing else matters."}
{"text":"Monta is me and my boyfriends favorite ramen place. We love it so much we couldn't find a better place here, LA, or in San Diego! We love it so much that we actually came here for our first date! I got so excited when I heard that they're opening up a second location. My boyfriend was recording on this side of town so we decided to go in after! It was next to a Denny's so it's pretty easy to find.   The place is small, just like Monta on Spring Mountain but it is bigger than it at the same time. But you don't feel as crowded in there. I'd say a table or two more. But then again I can't really complain because that's traditional in Japan. Their menu is actually bigger than Monta on Spring Mountain's!!! More ramen choices (but who needs it?) and more appetizers! We decided to get the ramen this time and next time, we're going to try all the new appetizers! I got miso with butter. Their miso is my favorite. It's also only $6.95... I think I spend more on myself at Mcdonalds!!! And the butter makes it creamier. It's my favorite ramen ever! I'll always be a Monta customer. I can't wait to come back for appetizers!!!   I love the items they put on the side as well. They have garlic, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, and more! You put in as much as you want too so it's not too salty or saltless.   I seriously appreciate the owner for Monta. He owns my favorite ramen place and also my favorite sushi place Goyemon!   Tip: I love taking the leftover broth home and putting it in my food (like top ramen or udon.) Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Monta Chaya is our favorite ramen joint in Henderson.  It rivals the ramen spots in Chinatown and you can't beat the price.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"How I missed you Tonkotsu!  I want to hug you and squeeze you and call you George.  And boy am I glad you are available with less waiting time and more food options!!!  HELLO MONTA CHAYA!  I'm sorry folks but to me there is no debate, Monta has the most amazing ramen in Vegas!  When my bowl arrived with those very thin fatty slices of pork, wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, scallions, an almost cooked egg and thin soft strands of noodles... my heart skipped a beat.  I looked down on it lovingly like it was my newborn babe... it was perfect.  And the broth... sigh... I am going to crave this broth every time I am sick. Or cold. Or hungover. Or pregnant. Or missing some good ol' comfort food.    We arrived in the Henderson location at 8pm and waited 10minutes for a table (both the Henderson and Chinatown locations are real tiny).  Hubby who is unfortunately not a ramen fan enjoyed his pork belly rice bowl immensely.  And I almost had a foodgasm with the chicken karaage dipped in the garlic puree (how do they make this???!!!).  The chicken was so moist and crispy and savory, while the garlic puree added a little tang to it. The skinny strips of marinated daikon offered refreshing relief in between the rich spoonfuls of ramen.  Perfect scores all around from food to ambiance to pricing to alcoholic drinks available to great service.  Wish you were next door Monta Chaya! (or maybe I should move?)"}
{"text":"Best ramen restaurant in Vegas in my opinion. Always get additional nori and egg on your ramen. They also have a very friendly staff and the restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come for the ramen stay for the bao.   I love their ramen. Their broth isn't too salty and fatty. Their prices are decent and pretty cheap. The wait staff is very friendly and very attentive. They always make sure glasses are filled with drinks and the tables are cleaned from any accumulated debris. The atmosphere is very casual. Monta Chaya is set up like a traditional Japanese restaurant. Simple and clean. One of my favorite aspects (besides the food) is that the wait staff takes your order on Ipad minis. Super Kawaii I must say.lol"}
{"text":"This may be a small place, but it has one of the best foods out here in Las Vegas! They have more on their menu than their original counterpart on Spring Mountain, and it's a bit more spacey as well. I have never tasted their ramen, since I always order their fried rice, rice bowls, cold noodles, and one of the appetizers. They gave my taste buds the feeling of a champion eater! Their condiments and sauce were incredibly unique and gave extra taste to my buds. This is about 30 minutes away from home, but I go here just to experience how their food is never ending delicious! Friendly staff as well, and their cooks are informative as well. I like how they take their orders from an IPad, plus their waitresses are cute hehe :D. I have never tasted any food similar to theirs because they probably have their own unique ingredients. And the price is a little on the cheap side.  I recommend this to everyone, whether you're a fan of Japanese foods or not, because this will transform your taste buds forever."}
{"text":"Ramen was delicious! I only wish the soup was hotter! Everything was fresh! Service was great! The ambiance of the place was good as well. Not a very large location! Definitely coming back here trying other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came back a few days ago when it was cold outside and I needed my hot soup fix.  Ordered the Kuro \"Black Garlic Oil\" Ramen.   It's a very strong garlic flavor, your soup comes out black.  If you like the taste of Garlic (like I do) this is a really good soup.  I didn't even have to add anything to it.     Also got the crispy rice that everyone else here mentioned.  I liked it a lot.  It kind of satisfies a mini-sushi craving you might have.     Still a great location, I've yet to see this place full.  Which is a good thing for me.  When I want my ramen, I want it now! =)"}
{"text":"Great Ramen at great prices! Also, try the: crispy rice, daikon salad, and get an Asahi on draft."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their pork belly bowl! Best place in town for an amazing price. I feel like I come here at least twice or three times a month. Ramen would be 4/5 rating. Staff is nice especially funny young guy who's like a comedian and pours the Asahi draft to the brim. Perfection!!! (His brother taught him well)"}
{"text":"We had the spicy miso ramen (extra nori/seaweed) and the tonkotsu (pork) ramen and side is gyoza....as the ramen was good as usual and always consistent but the gyoza was just \"ok\"...needed more nira (Japanese Chive) and more cabbage for the crunch consistency and texture.  Service is nice and friendly and very efficient with a lot of energy and smiles and follow-up service so I tipped the girls some extra cash.  This place is always good and clean and consistent and the service on point so thank you and arigato :)"}
{"text":"Spicy Miso Ramen is awesome. Crispy rice is great and pork belly and fried rice is delicious! Great place to go during slow hours. Not too many tables so you'll be waiting for at least 30 minutes for a table but quick for the bar area."}
{"text":"3 words.  PORK. BELLY. BOWL.   End of review.   Ok, just kidding. This is my first time here at this location but have been to the Spring Mountain one numerous times. I must confess, I have only had one of their ramen bowls and that was a Spicy Tonkatsu Bowl while my wife got the small Pork Belly Bowl. Once I tasted her Pork Bowl, I had to get one. Good thing they have a small size because while I was waiting for my order, I literally finished my wife's Pork Bowl. So of course I gave her my order when it got there. Yes, I still finished my bowl as well.  Whats so fancy about the Pork Belly Bowl you say? Well, its basically thick cut bacon that I think has been marinated in some kind of soy sauce and just grilled enough for to be cooked but not to the point that it gets crispy. They put it on top of a bowl of rice accompanied by shredded green onion and pickled ginger. I usually throw some sesame seeds and a mixture of red pepper flakes on top of there that is provided in shakers right on your table. This gives your dish even more good flavor.   As mentioned earlier, there are two sizes, Small ($3.95) and Regular ($5.75). I usually get the regular and most of the time it fills me up. On those times that I am really hungry, I have them add a side of Chasu Pork ($2.50) on top of it. If you refer to my pic, the Pork Chasu is basically 4 thinly sliced pieces of Pork Chop that is cooked the same way as the pork belly.   I like this location slightly better than the one in Chinatown because its almost twice as big so waiting is not as long. Of course the thing that takes it down to a 4 is that its way further away from my house. So whenever I am in the area, Pork Belly in my belly is a real possibility.   In closing, sorry if you are looking for a great review for ramen. Yes, its still available and you can still order it. Did I mention just how good the Pork Belly Bowl is?

{"text":"Yes, YES YES!!!  Im trying to start a yes chant.   There's a reason I never miss Monta when I am in Las Vegas, it is that damn good.  It rivals legendary Ramen spots in LA (Little Tokyo) like Shin Sen Gumi, Orochon, and Diakokuya.    I have always gone to the Monta Ramen location, and I figured i'd try the Chaya location.  Right off the bat, better decor, and better parking and just enough little differences in the menu to separate it from the Monta Ramen location.  Get an order of the Fried Rice on the side, its a must and really completes the experience!   Hits:     Different Ramen options, Fried Rice, and topping Cons:   Long wait times (worth the wait though)"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town for sure! cheap, quick, filling, and great service! In such a good area, overall just a fantastic restaurant"}
{"text":"That was really good! Got the standard ramen noodles with pork, corn and green onions. All of it was really good and made my night. I'm pretty sure I'll be visiting this spot often especially since it's right down the street from the house. This is one of those spots that if you're really in the mood for great ramen noodles you might drive across town to get these here. I would avoid going with a group since it's the size of my closet but ordering out you're good to go! Plus I like to take mine home and warm it up in another pot so it's real warm when it's time to eat instead of luke-warm."}
{"text":"Best ramen at the best prices. There is a couple new things on the menu check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a novice when it comes to ramen, but it was as good as advertised. I loved the silky smooth and rich broth of the tonkotsu ramen ($6.95) and the 2 slices of pork were so tender you barely need to chew.  The chashu buns ($5) weren't bad. I loved the pork and the mild spiciness of the sauce, but wasn't crazy about the cold, wet lettuce.   Seating is somewhat limited so avoid peak dining hours unless you're willing to wait. Prices are a bargain for what you get and if you're planning on paying with a credit card there's a minimum order of $10.  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Came here after a workout. Definitely has pretty good ramen. Just a bit too oily for my taste buds, but that's me personally. Other people may enjoy the oily part. I would give it 5 stars but the service was just too slow. The wait took a while and then it took another for 15 minutes to get my food. With that said, I will still go back because it's convenient and right next to the gym."}
{"text":"Summerlin-ers have every right to be jealous, since the newly opened Monta Chaya in Henderson is every bit as good as the flagship Monta, thereby negating the need to make the drive to Spring Mountain.  If  Monta Chaya is the sister restaurant to Monta, I would liken the former to Monta-ca (er...I mean Monica) Cruz, Penelope Cruz's younger and less famous sister, who is every bit as beautiful with perhaps more charm and flare for style (she's a fashion designer and world class flamenco dancer).  This comes in the form of a more spacious interior with higher ceilings, located next door to the adorable  Japan Creek Market (borrowing a page from Fukumimi Ramen which also has an adjacent Japanese market next door), and the additional flight of \"chaya\" appetizers consisting of the following: *chicken karaage *flash-fried shishito peppers *daikon salad with shredded egg,rice crackers, seaweed, and Wafu dressing *fried calamari in broth  *chasu buns (similar to Ippudo in Manhattan) *Hakusai salad (napa cabbage, crispy chili threads, crunchy noodles, sesame dressing)  Ramen and standard appetizers appears identical to the original location, and I went with the Hiyashi Chuka, which appears primarily during the warm months at Monta, so not sure if they plan on keeping this as a permanent item.  The Hikyashi Chuka is a cold ramen without broth which I liken to a bizarro version of the Korean bibimbap (hear me out) Rather than piping hot rice, assortment of julienned veggies, bulgogi, red chili paste, and fried egg mixed together in the Korean dish, you have nice firm cold noodles topped with julienned scrambled egg, cucumbers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, sprouts, marinated pork belly, sweet pickled radish, tomato, and a dollop of Japanese mustard on the side and your choice of sesame or yuzu dressing.  Deciding to feel a bit more untraditional, I went with yuzu and the dish was a refreshing mixture of textures, colors, and interplay of sweet spicy salty and sour.  Word of caution: unless you want to simulate biological warfare on your sinuses, do not mix the entire portion of japanese mustard into the mix.  Just use the end of your chopstick and do a light schmear into each bite to get that little hit much like you would for wasabi on sushi.        A wonderful addition to the ever-expanding ramen scene in Las Vegas and which will hopefully keep Shoku Ramen nearby on its toes so that the victors in the battle for ramen supremacy in Henderson will ultimately be diners like ourselves."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen! Possibly the best ramen I've had in the US. Small restaurant, almost always a wait unless you go alone and snag a seat at the bar.   Tonkotsu Shoyu broth is a mix of chicken and Tonkotsu -which I think is the best broth they have. Full flavored, creamy but not too rich. It's served with thin ramen noodles but I prefer the thicker ramen noodles.   The Tonkotsu broth alone is just a touch too rich for me -- and the Kuro Ramen, which is Tonkotsu with black garlic is sooooo heavy and rich you practically chew the broth. I had to use mouthwash every hour after eating just to get that intense salty-umami taste out.   I recommend adding on additional chashu (4 pieces for $2.50) and egg ($1.50)."}
{"text":"I always get the crispy rice and kimchi fried rice (yuuummm) along with ramen (usually the black garlic kuro). My new favorite thing to do is add some of the spicy oil provided on the table/bar to the fried rice (so good!). My fiance and I tend to go in at good times with very little to no wait and we always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing service and this is a legit noodle spot. The food was quickly prepared and still packed a punch. It can get busy quick so calling ahead probably isn't a bad idea."}
{"text":"As a fukumimi fan i'll admit monta is pretty good. But not better than fukumimi karage or chicken ramen. Also the people @ fukumimi are much more nice and accommodating to altering the menu.  As a giant fat ass that I am I try to avoid ramen.  Calamari is really good here too."}
{"text":"To be honest I used to hate monta.  But when they opened this location I've been going ever since. Plus, it's close to my place and my gym. But the only problem is... They don't have any desserts (sucks!)  but the service is really good & food."}
{"text":"Amazing. The fried rice might be better than the ramen... no, not better. As good as the ramen. There's a wait every time you go, but it's never long and well worth it. Do yourself a favor and run to this restaurant. You'll be an instant ramen fan."}
{"text":"Great place! Both the ramen and the appetizers are pretty good! Only thing that would make this place better would be a BIGGER space. It's kind of small (both Vegas locations), so it's limited seating which basically means there's almost always a decent wait time. So I only suggest this place if you're not on a time constraint!"}
{"text":"The noodles are not that good and the service is terrible. Showed up and the person working there greeted us with \"Who are you?\". Too many other options to ever go back. I'd rather eat my $1 Ichiban ramen"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to go for ramen. I even think that it is better then the original one on Spring Mountain.  The wait is not as long and they offer more items on their menu. My husband loves the garlic ramen.  It's so garlicky which is perfect! I also really like the daikon salad and their gyoza."}
{"text":"I love this location especially because of the stellar service and more spacious than the Spring Mountain locations.  Joe is always such an awesome server; very personable, helpful, and attentive! Not to mention hilarious. I've tried everything on the menu, to be honest. I usually get the Shoyu Ramen with a side of spicy and nori. Another great one is the Tonkatsu Shoyu! I am looking to try the Garlic ramen next. The karaage is delicious, as well as the pork Chashu buns! Everything is awesome! Thanks Joe for always being such a great server. :)"}
{"text":"After they closed it for 3 months I didn't see any changes in the interior. I noticed the noodle bowl they are using is now smaller so the portion is smaller too."}
{"text":"When I'm sick, I'm a baby. A baby who wants Ramen.   I caught a cold my GF and wanted something warm and broth like. Monta Chaya popped up on my Yelp app and within few minutes my order was placed and I was in swimming in Ramen. I normally get nervous about getting Ramen to go, this one of those foods you need eat quickly while it's still piping hot, if not, it could thicken up and be gross. This was not the case with Monta, they smartly keep everything separate to avoid a very mushy...  everything.    I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which the broth is made from boiling pork bones. This was pretty damn good. Crunchy veggies and was seasoned very well and not over salty. Which is a common ramen mistake. Ha, That rhymes.   I ordered an side of extra side pork for the ramen and some gyoza. The pork was super fatty and could have been cooked a tad longer, but still a great addition to the ramen. The fried gyoza had great flavor and were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just like I like em'!   Solid take out spot and the food was ready in about fifteen minutes, from phone call to pick up."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Food is good, prices are fair, and customer service has always been great. Only gave 4 stars because space is so small, there is usually a wait (though short), and for some reason they have split hours: open in morning, then close, then reopen. I went one day and was turned  away because they were about to close, only to reopen a few hours later. Odd."}
{"text":"The food here is always mmwah! Delicious! I'm not a huge ramen fan in general (too filling!) so I usually get the Mini Mentaiko Bowl and homemade potstickers or fried rice. The Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen broth that my boyfriend usually orders is excellent though :D   This Monta doesn't have a wait either. Definitely coming to this location from now on."}
{"text":"Japanese Comfort Food  On a cold night a few weeks ago, I needed some hot soup to warm me up, and this place did it just right.    Now... it's a tiny place... sits like 32 people, I think.  And on a cold Saturday night at 6:15pm there was a wait.   You walk in... write your name on the clipboard and hang out until one of the staff calls your name. Our wait was 35 minutes.  We were seated at the bar where we could see what our neighbors ordered and check out the action in the kitchen.  They turn food out quick in this place.  We were fed and out the door in like 25 minutes.... and we were NOT rushed at all.  At least, I didn't feel rushed. I had a warm tummy full of comfort food so I was a happy camper.  What We Ordered: * Hot Green Tea - this came in a can.  Can't say that I enjoyed it and wouldn't order it again.  It tasted 'ok'.  Not like what I was expecting, and the can definitely threw me.  * Tonkotsu Ramen - I thought this was \"creamy\". * Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen - This was lighter than the Tonkotsu.  I'd order this one again.  Both had lots of noodles, but the broth could be a bit hotter.  It was perfect when it was served but cooled fairly quickly... so I guess you have to eat it fast to keep it hot.  All of the ramens are pretty basic and then you have \"add-ins\" to make your ramen heartier or whatever.  I was happy with the basic ramen.  I wanted noodles and a comforting broth.  I got just that!  Pricing is fairly inexpensive.... I mean compared to most sit-down restaurants.  Compared to a Pho place... this place is few dollars more but not much."}
{"text":"So...there's this ramen place near me in SLC that I frequent maybe once or twice a month...and this place blows them out of the water. Like...without even breaking a sweat.  When we got there, it was packed (which seems to be a common theme), but we were seated fairly quickly (maybe a 10 minute wait?). And the best part, we got seated at the bar, which means I got a perfect view of the kitchen (I really love watching their operation--and this place has a well-oiled operation, let me tell you). Didn't take long for our server to come by for our drink order--super talkative (almost too much so), but super friendly. **Note: get the Calpico, you won't regret it.  I ordered the black garlic ramen and my boyfriend got the spicy tonkatsu, and we ordered the takana fried rice...and they were all FAB. Now...I read in a previous review how disappointed they were that the black garlic wasn't spicy--I'd like to clarify that reading the menu, I'm not sure where they got the idea it'd be spicy to begin with. The broth is really rich, and REALLY garlicky (hence the name), but not spicy. If you want spicy, I'd go with the spicy tonkatsu--one, it's in the name, and two, it's delightful. And don't get me started on that fried rice...holy crap, was that good.  If you're waiting for your food, take a moment to appreciate what's going on in that kitchen--it's mesmerizing. They had a packed house that night, and not one person back there was slacking. Every single one of them were on fire, our food came out surprisingly fast, and our orders never got screwed up. And the service? Wow. Near the end of our meal, our server accidentally knocked a Sharpie off and into my side plate of rice, and immediately ordered us a whole new order. Now, I wasn't going to say no because that stuff is delicious...but he totally went above and beyond with that, and it was greatly appreciated.  All in all, this place is amazing. It was a packed house, but with how friendly and efficient that place is, you wouldn't even notice. If we were back in our usual ramen place, we would've sat there for half an hour just waiting for our food, the service would've been sloppy, and you'd totally notice. So if anyone at Monta Chaya wants to have a chat, I'd love for you to open one up in Utah! :D"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on our last day of our vacation. I think the one I had was called Black Garlic Ramen.  I was pretty good.  Nothing fantastic.  Although I really enjoyed the gyoza that had a strong ginger flavor that I liked."}
{"text":"Great place. It was cheap , tasty, and good size portions. How can you not like a restaurant that serves beer for $2-2.95. There was a bit of a wait so we opted to sit at the counter , good move on our part. Fun watching them cook and prepare the food. Started off with calamari as an appetizer, that was ok if it wasn't for the Japanese broth it would of been super dry. The ramen was excellent , salty and plenty of meat. This was a good find, hidden in a shopping center and right off on Eastern. I'll be back for sure ."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. I've never had better ramen that this place! The staff is always welcoming and friendly. This restaurant is very popular so if you go at a busy time, you can usually expect a wait. I seriously have an addiction to their tonkotsu shoyu. So good!"}
{"text":"I must say, I had to update my review to give Monta a 5 star! I really under estimated this amazing joint.  I've been back for the pork belly bowl 3 times last week! 3 times and I didn't even realize it!!! I couldn't wait to try the ramen so I went back  to order the tonkotsu ramen today. Walked in at 4:00 pm with only 1 couple sitting in one corner, by 4:15 pm the place was completely full. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, a pork broth base, milky and thicker than the other broths on the menu. The broth base comes with thin noodles, ginger, scallions..for 6.95 and additional charge for topping. I opted for pork chashu, and flavored eggs. I've had the best ramen in LA, I've been to an LA ramen festival and surprisingly, Monta is as good!!! All the components on this dish was cooked perfectly!!! Seasoned just right!!! They also pay attention to details which is a big plus. The ramen bowl looks like it came out of a food magazine except my ramen bowl didn't look like one after I've moved my spoon around too many times (lol) scoping what's underneath the soup. Someone  from the next table ordered shredded scallions topping towering the bowl and it was just too pretty to eat. I truly enjoyed my meal. My Asian comfort food!  Wow! Loving this place! OVERALL: fast service, affordable and delicious! a must try!!!"}
{"text":"No dislikes. Simple but good. Pork belly is really good. One Of the best in Vegas. Ramen is inexpensive compared to other places but better. The service is awesome. Always greeted when walking in or leaving. Servers are always helpful and they make sure the tables are free of trash or empty plates. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for ramen, pork belly, even fried rice.  Great location. Next to golds gym so I can get a good solid workout in and go eat after. ...which I haven't done yet, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food and great service! My mother and I had their pork sandwiches as a starter; the buns they used were very fresh and airy with so much flavor! Then we tried the kimchi fried rice which was SOOO delicious and had extra kimchi on the side. And of course their ramen was to die for! We each got a bowl to ourselves. To top it off, the food came within 5-10 minutes. The portion sizes are big and it wasn't expensive at all. With all of that we paid under 30 bucks. We are definitely making our 20 minute trip back here for our next noodle craving ^_^"}
{"text":"After watching Ramen Girl a few weeks ago I've been having an insane Ramen craving.  Hey now.....Stop laughing.  Are you a Ramen fan?  Who on earth doesn't like Brittany Murphy?!  It's been a while since I've hit up Monta and they've added a few new selections like their Spicy Tonkatsu and their Black Garlic Oil Tonkatsu Ramen.  I ordered the Black Garlic and it added a new depth of rich flavor to the already flavorful tonkatsu broth.   I'm always a sucker for the kaedama - extra noodles. It's $1.50 and even after I'm full I just have to give in for the value.   I end up paying for it after I leave and especially on a work day.  There were also some new vegetarian options like their daikon salad which was really light, not over dressed and was a perfect compliment to my hearty bowl.   We also got an order of the shishito peppers which were delicious."}
{"text":"My man and I have been on a two state ramen journey. We have visited several placed, all found through the assistance of Yelpers.  Monta Chaya is the best in my opinion.  The only negative thing that I can say is that the temperature of the broth could be a little hotter. Everything else is perfect.  My spicy miso ramen with corn is so good that I don't care that I have to wait thirty minutes for a table.  I can also overlook the following that other Yelpers cannot: Seating so close you can smell the food of the people at the next table. Not so great customer service from wait staff. Blast of cold wind every time someone opens the door.  I have also tried the gyoza and was not impressed, but the ramen is so good that I will not deduct stars from my review.  Five stars because I am in love with spicy miso ramen."}
{"text":"Yes the ramen is amazing like everyone says it is. The hidden gem here for me though is the cold noodles. A lot of Japanese restaurants only serve these types of noodles in the summer so it's nice to get it year round here. I've only had the sesame dressing but it is so much lighter than the heavy hot ramen options. I also really love their karaage, takana fried rice, and the crispy rice. Everything is amazing but seriously give the cold noodles a try. I don't think I've ever seen anyone else in the place order them."}
{"text":"I love Monta. The calamari is delicious. The pork belly bowl is to die for. And I love the tonkotsu ramen is yum yum yum!! Can't wait for them to reopen!"}
{"text":"I love their pork belly bowl and their chashu bans are delish! The service is always nice, I love this place. 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Best ramen place in town. They have great customer service too.  Highly recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"I admit that I was one of the faithful that stood in line for a seat at the Spring Mtn location.  So I was ecstatic when they opened a place on my side of town. Tried it a couple of weeks ago, not too long after it opened. The tonkatsu ramen was way too salty. I'll chalk it up to opening hiccups... And will definitely try again. However, since discovering Fukumimi's, it's going to be hard for me to stray."}
{"text":"The ramen was too salty for my taste. I can't tell if the ingredients were tasty.  The saltiness masked or overwhelmed everything.  Too bad.  Nice place and good service."}
{"text":"The noodles. You guys.  These noodles. Insane.  Thanks for the dude at Spring training for the suggestion.  Heck ya.  Go Dodgers!"}
{"text":"Good place with quick service.  My husband and I each ordered a bowl of ramen with two add-ons each, an appetizer and one beer and the bill was $28 which I thought was pretty decent. We will definitely come back but continue to seek out a better ramen house."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to grab a meal on Eastern!  Service is always good and fast. Food is consistently delicious! Prices cannot be beat. Best place to eat something satisfying, especially after 10pm when most restaurants on Eastern close.   My favorites are the miso ramen with egg and their chashu bowls and buns are delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to ramen in the city.  This location is much less crowded than the Spring Mountain one...it's larger and also further from the strip.    My usual order  consists of the tonkotsu ramen with wavy noodles and the daikon salad as an appetizer.  The tonkotsu broth is rich, flavorful and filling...everything a good tonkotsu should be.  If I'm hungry, I order kaedama -- extra noodles -- for just $1.50 more, so make sure to save some broth of you're in the mood for extra.  The daikon salad is a personal favorite.  Light, refreshing, tasty...a perfect starter.    Also delicious...the pork belly bowl...filled with melt-in-your-mouth pork, the mentaiko (cod roe) bowl, the fried rice, and the chashu buns.    Life is too short for packaged ramen!  Head over to Monta-chaya and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Such a little hidden secret! I'd rather come here than drive up to china town!!  The pork buns had so much flavor and the meat was super juicy. I had the black garlic ramen, it was so flavorful and delicious I could eat it daily!  Portions are huge and decently priced so it worth a quick trip even if your on a budget.  They just need more seating :)"}
{"text":"Feeling a little under the weather and my better half was craving porky belly so monta it is. She ordered pork belly and chasu bowls. I went with gyoza, crispy rice, shishitou peppers and a bowl of spicy ramen in hopes that it'd clear my stuffy nose. Everything came out right away and service was efficient. Food was delicious and comforting."}
{"text":"This place is ok for ramen. The broth is flavorful but packed with something that made me super thirsty at night - not good. And the noodles are not handmade. These two things are enough to make me go eeeehhhh....  Good place for cheap eats, but if you're on a quest to find good ramen, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is still five stars in my book. I came back and got their famous cold noodle ramen with yuzu base. It is quite possibly my favorite thing to eat in the world. I'm a little biased because I like citrusy flavors, but it's definitely a great summer meal.  There's no broth that comes with it, and the noodles are chilled, but full of flavor. You can order it vegetarian, or the normal way which still comes with a few slices of tonkotsu, and some other vegetables. I would definitely recommend it to those who love cold noodle, and for those who love ramen and want something different."}
{"text":"Yum! This is a great location similar to monta ramen but in a more convenient location for me.  Had the miso ramen and it was amazing! The flavor was there, a nice sized portion, and pretty cheap! Well under $8 per bowl. The service was great and had a nice atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely heavenly silky noodles in slightly salty broth with tender fatty pork good enough for the most discriminating asian palette."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The pork belly bowl is fantastic... Melty pork belly and rice - what more could you ask for?  We also tried the little sandwich things as well and aside from feeling like I was poking the Stay Puft marshmallow man they were delicious.  This location was much easier to get into than the Spring Valley - even at 7pm - but just as scrumptious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally eat here because everyone goes on about this place but......As a self proclaimed ramen expert....it's just ok :( they gyoza had way too much garlic, the portion of noodles is too small, n being completely empty was saying something. The good side is they cook the eggs perfectly n this is such a clean restaurant.  If I'm craving ramen for maybe lunch when I won't eat that much ..I'll give this place another try"}
{"text":"This is the second location of Monta (in Henderson). Always had a great experience at the original one off Spring Mountain Rd, so I expected this to be the same.  We were lucky that there wasn't a wait when we showed up.  The service was very quick and friendly.  Since we cane as a group, it was easy to order multiple items off the menu.  Some of the items ordered included:   Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen - pretty good (adding egg made it better) Gyoza - excellent Fried rice - something about it didn't taste that great...mediocre at best Pork Belly Bowl - great flavor Chicken Karaage  - ok Shishito Peppers - great  Overall, the place is decent,  but I still prefer the one on Spring Mountain Rd."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was great!  When it's raining buckets and it's cold outside, nothing hits the spot like some good ol'fashion Ramen.  If you follow my reviews, you know that I like ramen and can be kind of picky. Well, Monta Chaya did not disappoint.  I ate around \"old people\" time (aka 5 pm) and there was a wait. However since I was a solo diner and didn't care if I was at a table or counter I was seated pretty quickly.  Fun Fact - If you're at Disneyland and you don't really mind riding separately from your girlfriend/boyfriend/parole officer, then jump into the single rider line and you'll get through faster and soon be enjoying the singing from creepy animatronic children from various countries while you're stuck on a boat.  Anyhow, the menu selection is simple, it's just two pages with photos.  It's mainly Ramen and a handful of side dishes such as fried rice, calamari, pork over rice, etc.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen (Pork with pork broth) and a small bowl of marinated pork belly with ginger and green onions over rice.  Fun tip - spoon some of the ramen pork broth into your bowl of pork belly and rice as you eat. It keeps the rice and pork juicy and infused with the goodness of the pigs that have given their lives for your cause.  The noodles were perfect, not too soggy and just the right level of al dente. Al dente in German means delicious noodles that aren't soggy.  Monta Chaya missed out on that fifth star because unlike other ramen places it didn't include the seaweed as standard issue like at Hokkaido Santouka (Costa Mesa) and the chashu slices were smaller. However the prices for the amount of food you get is pretty reasonable. I'll definitely look to be back if I'm in the area.  https://youtu.be/CQUb-uVEO4E"}
{"text":"We tried it yesterday for a late lunch and then AGAIN today for a 7PM dinner, yeah it really is that good. We really like this place compared to other Japanese noodle places in Henderson, the noodle portion is a decent size and I would think you would order the extra side of noodle portion if you are really in need of a noodle belly bomb. The broth is perfectly seasoned and you have  several choices to choose from as well as extra toppings. We suggest you try the crispy rice appetizer, it's crunchy rice with spicy tuna on top, very unusual and very delicious I didn't really like the soft white Chasu buns with the pork in them, but my wife did and apparently it's a favorite of many others. I tried the Kim Chee fried rice and it was well done and not too oily or overly spicy. Also I went outside the box and tried their cold noodle dish and it was to me the best thing I ever ate in 2014 and will probably order that dish more than the hot soup dishes that usually gets me overheated. (not in spice, but in warmth) but I guess that is the draw to have some hot noodles in the winter time. The drinks are served in cans with a side of ice, but hopefully they will have a fountain to serve from later since a per can charge for soft drinks can add up on the refills. Also some flat screen TV's on the walls would be very welcomed during sports time, but then again maybe not since the place is small and people are usually always waiting for a table, so probably better for people to eat and leave right away to make room for others. The wooden benches are kind of uncomfortable, but as I said, they want you to eat and make room for other diners, so eat eat eat and go go go!  Prices are very reasonable, the food is tasty and not overly salty, lots of flavors involved here, really good eats! The odds are we will be back within the week, very well done!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen shop.   Amazing Chasu pork.   Awesome thick wavy noodles.   More space to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but then the waitress, not so much. She didn't  pay attention to my order and she looks like her mind is on somewhere else."}
{"text":"I recently checked out Monta Chaya in Henderson, and was truly impressed. There was a bit of a wait (20 minutes) when I went on Saturday night, but hey, that's when everyone wants to go out to eat, right?  Very happy that they have VEGETARIAN RAMEN on the menu, which I think is a fairly recent development. My bf was able to slurp to his heart's content. The veggie ramen had a soy milk base (weird for me but he liked it) and had sprouts, corn and tomatoes on it. We tried two veggie apps, the daikon salad (very good--definitely recommend) and the shishito peppers, which weren't much as they were just spicy peppers with a miso sauce on them.  Loved my tonkotsu ramen. It was super creamy and hearty. The broth was full-bodied and up to par. Noodles perfectly cooked. Wish I had remembered to order an egg on top! They cost extra."}
{"text":"Last week, it was a little chilly, so I thought it would be great to get ramen. There's so many eateries on Eastern, I figured that there had to be at least one Ramen place along this strip. And low and behold, it is the ever famous Monta!. I have now been to three Monta ramen houses and I have to say, the broth here is thee best!  For some reason, the ramen seems less expensive at this Monta location. I ordered the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen which was only $6.95. For another $2.25, I added nori and egg. And as always, I needed their house made gyoza. I just couldn't finish it all, so it was great having it for dinner.  You just can't go wrong at Monta. Great food, fast and friendly service, nice atmosphere. This place deserves their 5-star."}
{"text":"I just left there with a couple of my friends. It was unbelievable they said that their computer went down so they messed up our order . Honestly people who came way after us got their order . We kept on reminding them but all they gave us was were working on it. After an hour of waiting for noodles, we decided to pay for our drinks  and appetizers and leave . Can you imagine being hungry, cold, and ignored. Sorry but I am going back to Shoyu where you're always welcome and appreciated."}
{"text":"A solid ramen chain through and through.  Always busy and you will get served quick.  Just don't make the same mistake I did and get the kimchi fried rice.  It's nasty to be honest."}
{"text":"I have been to most of the ramen places on Spring Mountain and Tropicana but still come back to Monta Chaya. Started going to the Monta on Spring Mountain, however this location is more convenient.   I find the broth to not be salty and you have several selections pork, chicken or both for your ramen. The roasted chashu pork served with the soup simply melts in your mouth. The chicken karaage and fried rice are delicious too.   Although bigger than the Spring Mountain location, you will always find a line at prime times. Good news is, they are fast at turning tables. Fresh ingredients, extremely consistent, expertly prepared equals a quality experience every time."}
{"text":"Prepackaged Ramon noodles are used here. I sat at the bar around the cooks, and I saw them. I thought I was getting the real deal here, but if you are looking for hand made noodles this is not the place to go :("}
{"text":"I come here all the time for ramen. They're very consistent with the quality and flavor their ramen and that's always a plus =)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Ramen in LV.  In Ramen, the broth makes it for me.  The tonkatsu is meaty and hearty with a hint of the fat from the pork that it's made with.  Very lovely.  The ramen is consistantly good and never over cooked.  The pork belly rice is wondeful with the sweetness and saltiness one would ask for with this kind of dish.  Best ramen place on this side of town hands down."}
{"text":"This place is worth trying if you are craving cheap, decent quality ramen in the dessert. I got the miso ramen since it was highly recommended by the other Yelpers and it was a good choice. The only thing that I didn't like was the slight eggy taste of the broth which I never really experienced with all the ramen places I have been to. The two slices of pork was good but it was basically all fat and barely any meat. I don't really like eating fat, but I make certain exceptions and ramen is one of them. The only downer is it was all fat which was kind of boring in terms of texture since it was all slimy. I would come back to try the other dishes and hopefully it will be an even better experience. Give this place a shot because the prices and quality of the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"A bit salty for my taste but still one of the most flavorful bowl of ramen yet.  Earl and I shared the cod roe bowl, and each got our own bowl of ramen. -Earl got the shoyu ramen with an order of chashu pork and nitamago -I got the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with an order of chashu pork  We both agree that my broth tasted more delicious than his shoyu broth, but the thicker noodle in the shoyu bowl tasted better than my thinner egg noodles.  Halfway through my bowl of ramen, I was stuffed, so Earl ate the rest of my ramen.  The chashu pork was nice and tender.  I think next time I will not order the extra pork because it was too much for me.  We sat at the bar and had great service.  The place is small, but seats more than its prior location.  I am definitely glad that it moved to Eastern because it is so much closer."}
{"text":"Delish! I just had the fried rice (take home) for breakfast and I could go for seconds quaint and calming atmosphere, very friendly staff, all food made to order, and please try the fried chicken app. The ramen my fiend created as absolutely delishious as well, Im really looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try something a little different.  So I asked the waitress, about the noodles.  There were so many choices, so she helped me choose one.  I also wanted to try a couple of other things.  So once I got my food, I asked for seasons.  (I really only wanted soysauce)  But she gave me like 5 things.  Some powder, one looked like mashed garlic, soysauce, and a couple of other things, I have no idea what they were.  So it was too funny to me, because I didn't know what seasoning was suppose to go with what dish.  So I kinda just threw a little of this, and a little of that in all the dishes I got.  And it worked for me.  I really enjoyed my food from here."}
{"text":"This noodle place is hands down my favorite in Vegas. The service is always outstanding and the food is delicious! I am always impressed when walking out of here. The quality of food, and especially the water is top notch. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"They put crack in the broth.  They have to... The best places in NYC don't compare to this place.  The broth is so rich and thick, without being syrup.  I need to quit my job and move to Vegas, for no other reason, than to eat here more often."}
{"text":"This restaurant was packed when I came in for lunch. Despite how busy the restaurant was, the food arrived quickly and the service was great. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, which was delicious and inexpensive. Overall, this is a restaurant that I would recommend for anyone who wants something cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Wow...... what an AWESOME place! The food is fantastic . Found a new place for some ramen."}
{"text":"I ordered take out today. I got the tonkatsu ramen with nori on top and pork buns. She informed me that the ramen noodles came uncooked for the to-go orders which was fine. I figured it would be like pho where you pour the broth over it and it would cook. This was not the case. Now I'm left with raw noodles in thick flour-y broth even after trying the microwave. It was my fault for not inquiring more but I didn't think my food should have needed instructions.   Secondly, the pork buns were good but not as traditional pork buns. They are closer to a pork sandwich with their inclusion of lettuce and mayo. Good, but if you're a fan of traditional pork buns then sit this one out.  All in all I will try sitting in the next time as I'm sure the ramen is better when it is properly prepared."}
{"text":"One of those Can't-believe-I-haven't-reviewed this place deals. Everytime I've come in they've never ceased to disappoint. I'm glad I don't have to drive as far as Spring Mountain to get me some satisfying ramen. They're always prompt and on point with their service. Their menu is pretty straightforward, no frills with a few appetizers and fried rice to get the ball rolling. Cute, casual and modern decor, the place seats probably 30 people. Tables are filled with the appropriate accoutrement Montas always a soild standby for that quick bite, casual date or getting rid of that lingering cold!"}
{"text":"The best Japanese Ramen house ever!!!!! The customer service is awesome!!  The food is always great.... Takeout orders are available as well. The restaurant itself is a bit small so be prepared to wait 5-10mins before being seated.... Totally worth the wait!!! If you like Ramen I highly recommend giving this little restaurant a try!!!"}
{"text":"Was in vegas for EDC and my lil bro suggested this place for yummy ramen.  Being that it was a bajillion degrees outside, I had no idea why my friends were craving ramen. Anyhow, the reviews looked good so we decided to check it out.  Upon arriving I saw that they had other, really affordable options, available. Instead of killing myself with super hot ramen, I went with the Pork Belly Bowl, and that was a good choice.  For less then $7 you get a big bowl of delicious, fatty (but not too greasy), perfectly salted, steaming hot bowl of thinly sliced pork belly over soft white rice.  Served with lots of green onions and an array of sauces on the table, the meal was simple and yummy.   Personally i couldn't get enough of how delicious the pork belly was. Perhaps since it was cut thinly, even though pork belly is normally overwhelming, the pork belly here was just the right amount of fatty.  I mixed my bowl with sesame oil, a little bit of soy sauce, pickled ginger, and mixed in so garlic paste that was reserved for the ramen (best choice ever).  If I'm ever in Vegas again, I'll definitely visit this little joint and probably give the ramen a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie ramen. It lacks in flavor, the umami factor is missing. But it doesn't have to be that way. An easy fix if they used the vegan chicken boullion cubes you can find at Smith's or Sprout's, I use when I make my own soups. I'll have something else next time. Atmosphere and presentation is A+. Good prices. I wont give them a lower rating because I feel they deserve another shot."}
{"text":"Ramen time!!  I think both locations are pretty much equidistant from my home, but I find myself coming here more.  The food is more or less the same at both Monta's but upon dining in yesterday (9/24), I noticed the ramen was a little less salty.  This is not a bad thing!  Before it was a bit much.. I do enjoy salty foods but man does it taste much better.  My fav here is the mentaiko bowl but I most certainly get down on some noodles, especially the yuzu cold noodle and the shoyu ramen (no pork chashu, topped with nitamago instead).  Whether I go for cold or hot depends on the weather or my temperment, but I'm usually a cold noodle eater most of the time.  Flavorful grubs and the price isn't too bad.  Plus, if you are a hungry like me, you can always opt for more noodles if you have some ramen broth left over - kaedama style."}
{"text":"Dude, this place is lovely. Great design. Great, no wait, AMAZING pork, even better ramen. If you don't enjoy this place then I'll question your sanity."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just really hungry or sick with the flu that made my ramen here taste really good. This place hit the spot. I will come back here. It reminds me of a spot I always go to in LA."}
{"text":"i like this location better than the spring mountain. they have more stuff on the menu. i love trying new items. this time i had Shishito pepper and kimchi for app. i did not care for the shishito pepper much. kimchi was good. next i had the Chashu Bowl. that was delicious. the staff was friendly, rest was clean. the food came out quick. i will def be back for more!"}
{"text":"Since the infamous closing of Noodle Cha Cha, I have been searching the depths of Yelp to find a good Ramen spot within the Henderson area.  Fortunately, I found Monta Chaya on Eastern.  The layout is small-mid size, clean, with wood decor. Obviously their specialty is Ramen, so their menu is predominately Ramen based with appetizers like gyoza and karaage. I usually get the Miso Ramen and it's legit.  If you want to add extras (like a boiled egg) then you're gonna pay extra.  No complaints, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great price for great meal! Every dish can be completely customized to your liking and the service is fast. The only problem is the dinning room is small so it gets very busy."}
{"text":"I had something at Monta Chaya that I've not even seen at other Japanese restaurants.  Cold Noodles.  We got them vegetarian style, which just meant without meat.  You get a big plate of cold ramen noodles with either yuzu or sesame sauce, and it is topped with veggies like cucumber, onion, seaweed, other things I either couldn't identify or don't remember.  We went with the yuzu and I loved it, but we'll try sesame next time.  We also shared the takana fried rice and some salad that was awesome.  The takana was great, but I want to try the kimchi fried rice next time.  Those are pretty much the only vegetarian options since this is mainly a ramen place and all the ramens have meat-based broths.  But, I'd still go here every time I'm in Vegas from now on because even though they only have a few vegetarian dishes, the ones they have are AMAZING.  Great prices, the whole meal for two people was $20."}
{"text":"A godsend for South Las Vegans. No more will we have to drive the 15 minute route to Chinatown for a noodle fix. No more will we have to fight off bad drivers for parking. Here,we have found home.   Monta Chaya is conveniently located off the 215 on Eastern,making it a central location for our brothers and sisters in Green Valley,as well as not too much of a commute from Silverado Ranch dwellers.   The service is quick and efficient - I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food,and the wait staff is always polite and - to an extent - authentic in their Japanese roots.   The food is decent quality - slightly greasy and could use bigger portions,but my biggest issue with their menu is its limited scope. Yes,it's a ramen place,and they serve a few rice topping bowls,but missing some Japanese house staples like chicken cutlet (tonkatsu).   All in all,it's not a bad place for a late night meal (closes at 11pm most nights),which makes it a good late post-gym alternative if you don't want to cook.   Long. Live. Monta."}
{"text":"My most favorite place to eat...if you love Ramen you'll love this place...it's a small place but its bigger than Manta Ramen on Spring Mountian but just as good,,same owners I believe, same menu."}
{"text":"RAMENNNN so close to where I practice yoga. Glad there's one more spot for me to pig out before I go try to balance my body weight on one toe.   I came here last week with Dana S for some good times, great oldies, and good ramen soup. I had the Miso and it was delicious. It also took about 2.5 seconds to get to us. Delicious and fast, what more could you ask for? It is also pretty cheap--$8 for a giant bowl of soup is none too shabby.   The restaurant only seats about 30 people, and the waitress was kind enough to ask somebody to move so that we could sit together. Come later in the afternoon so that you don't have to wait forever for a spot to sit during the lunch rush.   New restaurant in my rotation!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Eastern location (I've been to both in Vegas). I liked the decor, it's larger - or at least less crowded - than the location in Chinatown. The food quality is great, service was quick, and everything was clean. My only complaint would be that the Chau siu portions are not that large. I would definitely return, I guess I don't need to eat that much meat."}
{"text":"I honestly like this place but they have a lot of flaws they have only 2 pieces of meat in ramen and the pork belly is the best item here but seriously charge for anything extra you want!!! One dollar extra for hot sauce and 3 dollars for extra broth? Wow seriously you have to charge for every thing this is ridiculous! California ramen is better I think I'm going to have to try a different place that doesn't charge for every little thing next thing you know they lol be charging for chopsticks"}
{"text":"I literally crave this ramen! If I could go there every day I would!  Great food, great prices, and friendly wait staff. Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Really good Japanese ramen! I love how they have one near me in Hendertucky (Henderson) cuz I live far from the strip and another one in china town near the strip. So if you are ever visiting Las Vegas and are staying in the strip during your stay, go to monta! It is really close to the strip on spring mountain and Decatur of china town.   Although the venue is really small, make sure u call ahead of time to set a reservation and know a time frame when to get there so you don't have to wait in line. The place is popular and always busy. If you can, go in a small group or by yourself so u can experience the great food they have with no hassle. Sitting at the bar is preferred! You can also see them cook in front of you.   My favorite dish is the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with extra seaweed, extra chashu, and egg. Also their side dish spicy fried rice. The menu is cheap and you can order extra additional sides to your ramen bowl for good price too. If you can't finish your meal, they provide you with take out to go."}
{"text":"Love the Miso Ramen. I asked for two orders of eggs because they are so delicious. My husband and I have been twice and will definitely be back again soon. The restaurant is small, but way worth the wait."}
{"text":"It was a very good ramen for a reasonable price.  Thin noodles in thick Tonkotsu soup with good chasuu pork."}
{"text":"Best Ramen ever in my opinion...and i mean EVER! The chase melts in your mouth and I've never found any other place like it. They have great appetizers such as Spicy Tuna on crispy rice, calamari, and my favorite - pork belly buns. If you go at the right time, the wait won't be long. But please note: They are closed mid-day for break. My favorite ramen to order is Shoyu Ramen and/or the Garlic broth ramen with the wavy noodles. You must definitely go here!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place so we finally went with friends and honestly I was unimpressed. It's not that anything particularly bad stuck out but I was disappointed since everyone rants and raves. I didn't like the mushrooms that come on top of the ramen. I think my biggest com ain't is that they charge extra to include chasu, egg, green onion, etc. my favorite ramen place in town, Ramen Sora, includes these with different ramen types and overall is cheaper for a larger portion."}
{"text":"This place was great. The ramen was fantastic! The prices for add-ons seemed a wee-bit high, but definitely the food was good enough to mitigate any negatives of having higher priced add-ons.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, which I was very pleasantly surprised by. The broth was thick; seems like a lot of restaurants are serving the tonkatsu ramen with a more...shoyu'esque broth nowadays.   Call ahead and make sure there is seating though! VERY small dining space with VERY limited seating. Be prepared for a lengthy wait.  Would I come back here? Yes Would I recommend to others? Yes"}
{"text":"Always come early on the weekend if you don't want to wait a long time in their small entryway where you always feel like you are in someone's way.  The seating situation is fairly small like most noodle houses.  This is the first time we did not have to wait for counter seating on a Friday night since it opened, which was awesome!  Great quick service and tasty food as always.  The pork buns are so devine.  I do not know how they make those soft rolls, but I want to!  We both went with the shoyu Ramen this time and shared an order of extra noodles.  Perfect."}
{"text":"My first time having ramen.  I am amazed!   Everything was had so much flavor.  The miso was really good.  The broth is so good you'll be wanting more noodles lol.    I will drive from LA for this every weekend"}
{"text":"Our go to noodle stop! Perfect every time. Fast, friendly service. I usually have to daikon salad, crispy rice and Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. My son and husband love the calamari and chasu bans."}
{"text":"this place is just as amazing as the original Monta!  I'm pretty simple and went with the shoyu ramen which was delicious as always. I usually prefer the thicker noodle. my brother went with the tonkatsu (sp?) ramen and the crispy chicken. I never order much else off the menu but the chicken was bomb!  I have to say, the ambience and space in this one is better since it is much more open. also the staff here is great, they actually interact with you more. our waiter had a great personality. I didn't get his name but I loved the fact he had some witty things to say. made me think less about how I had to go back to work."}
{"text":"This place had so much potential, but it's hard when your establishment is crammed to fit guest inside, you won't seat anyone unless the party is present, your service is horrible, and you charge for refills.  Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent, but we were ignored and wanted refills.  The place is so small I don't know how you could have ignored us.  Look at my photos to see the typical Asian culture mentality - charge per canned soda ridiculous prices.  Yes, I said CANNED.  Sigh...  What really upset me about this visit was the lack of service and waiting nearly 20 minutes to be seated.  Another 10 minutes to take our order, another 10 to get food.  Won't be back, sorry."}
{"text":"So disappointed. On our most recent visit here, I had to remove two stars because I was upset by their customer service. After placing a pick up order, I immediately called back to make a correction to one of my five items and the staff wouldn't allow to make one change because they advised the cook was already making the order. I realize I had made the error, but there was no attempt by the staff to right a service failure, or even negotiate the change even when I offered to get an additional menu item. In addition, it was very obvious the host/server's tone was very annoyed I had even requested the change. Regardless, if we had a pick up order or dine in order, and mistakenly ordered something we didn't like/want, I would expect the establishment to at least demonstrate empathy and replace the order - especially if the order was not even served yet!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! The Takana fried rice is my absolute fave. They jave the best Pork out of all the Ramen houses I've tried. I go to both locations and this one is best. I just wish they were closer to home."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya has officially closed! (At least at this location.)  A sign on the door now states they will be moving (pic attached). Hopefully management actually updates us this time!"}
{"text":"For all you Monta Chaya lovers... Good News!!! I just saw their awning go up for their new location. They relocated to Eastern and Richmar right next door to Woof Gang bakery and the Gluten Zero Bakery. Doesn't say when they will open but my guess is soon! Anybody know more?"}
{"text":"I have to give this place two stars, it's not because of the food but service. Every time I come here they are so packed in such a tiny building the servers seem to ignore you. I usually order it to go because of this problem. For having two locations and both having the the same problem, one would think it's time to expand get off the corporate greed hire more employees and expand your business if the food is great people are going to continue to show up recognize the growth and deal with it because it's very obvious the food is delicious people are showing up however the long waits and cramped quarters are eventually going to drive business away."}
{"text":"Better than average but good value.. but they forgot my fried rice order.. second time here first time was fantastic.."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here last night! 3 of us were able to sit at the bar without any wait (it was about 5:15). Service was great. The food was simply to die for. Between the three of us we had pork ramen, pork belly bowl, Takana fried rice, pork bun appetizer, and gyoza. We enjoyed every bite of every item. I can't recommend Monta Chaya more highly. If you've been thinking about going, go!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie ramen, and it was great. Only issue was the leeks in the dish were so overpowering to the point where I couldn't quite taste the noodles as much. And I love the noodles. The broth is soymilk, and it's also quite overpowering. Besides that, I had a tomato in mine, and some corn sprinkled on top. Mine friend loved hers, though!"}
{"text":"Wait staff is very kind when you walk in everyone says hello. Service is fast and the food is reasonably priced we loved it and we will go back"}
{"text":"Since the night i pulled into this town with all our belongings in a truck we went out to eat here and never stopped we love this restaurant  and yes its always busy but worth the wait. When they closed for a little while withdraw set in lol. The unfortunate  part is the bowls got smaller and they are closed mid day when id love to go with my son when get he gets out of school... i used to order the miso with extra noodle but no need now since the portion has gotten smaller. I didnt mind paying extra  because the size was perfect but oh well.. go back to old bowls! We still love this place and service is friendly well always keep coming in"}
{"text":"Here's what I can say. This is the second time I've came here and it's been packed and I couldn't eat. That's a great sign. On a Thursday at 800pm the restaurant was full and 6 people waiting. All good signs. Smelled amazing and the people dining all had things that looked good. Can't wait to actually eat here lol."}
{"text":"I was a fan of their old location off Spring Mtn and I'm still a fan after trying this new location.  The food is a copy and paste so if any of you reading now didn't get to try it at the old location then you're not missing out on anything.    I was hungry on a random night and decided to come to my favorite spot in Vegas, 215/Eastern, and asked anyone if they were hungry too.  I ended up with a party of five and contemplated whether or not we would be able to sit down and eat at Monta Chaya because if anyone who has been to Monta Ramen before knows that they are always backed up with customers.  This place was not busy!    I ordered what I had last time to compare which was the miso ramen and extra noodles.  My friend ordered a pork belly bowl so I didnt have to order that last night.  Everything tasted exactly how it was served on Spring Mtn, which is a plus!  The rave about the old Monta still lives on with Monta Chaya, the place is still small but we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.  The waitress was the same from the old location but it sucks they still serve tea out of a can.  At least it's a safe bet that the drink will be clean hehe.  But do come in here if you've never tried Monta Ramen before.  Monta Chaya might have just bumped herself into my Seven World Wonders of 215/Eastern!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's so good. The ramen alway comes out perfect. My only complaint is that the service is a little slow. There were three open tables and five open seats at the bar and the waitresses were so caught up and stressed they didn't care about ppl waiting. I get it when it's busy. Still worth a try and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite authentic ramen place for Vegas. Even though there's almost always gonna be a wait, it's worth it. I've never once had a bad experience at this place and the service is also amazing. This is going to be my favorite ramen spot in the city for a very long time."}
{"text":"Ramen is what they do and they do it well! It's the same as the Monta in Chinatown, although with an appetizer menu that might have a couple more items. Noodles and broth are great. Very freindly service with food that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Monta is good. There is one place I'd choose over Monta but I won't name it.  Monta is always busy! Is it unfair to like it less because of that? Probably! I don't frequent them because of this so.. Yea..  Anyways their ramen is good. The price is about average for Vegas.   They have excellent sides though. Their Gyoza, Calamari, and fried rices are all amazing! I'd return for these before the ramen.  Idk if I had an off day here but my ramen mostly tasted of salt. No real depth of flavor. I had the one that's pork and chicken broth.  I'd go back but definitely not my first choice for ramen."}
{"text":"I have had the original Monta on my bookmarks for, like, ever, but if we were driving all the way to Chinatown, my husband never wanted to get ramen. Yay for Monta Chaya, right down the street from us! The atmosphere inside is very austere - hip and asian-feeling! It's small, probably seats about 20-25, but we didn't have to wait on a Thursday night. Prices are good. $7 for a bowl of ramen, a little extra to add eggs/more bean sprouts/extra pork/etc. Most importantly, it's good! We had the pork tonkatsu, pork miso, fried rice, and the fried spicy tuna (I think that's what it's called). Everything was really good, and we were so full we didn't even finish it all. I'll definitely be back, and will bring the kids!"}
{"text":"First time and wasn't disappointed.  Located right next to Gold's Gym, it's the obvious place to go for your post-workout carbs.  Met here with friends Ian A, Sugi S, Shirley B, and Terri R after a session at Gold's.  We were immediately seated and got our orders in.  Ramen Sora and Fukumimi are my only other ramen joints that I have hit out here in Vegas.  So far, I would still have Sora as my favorite with Monta coming in at a very close second.  Others may think differently, but this is my review and it's my opinion.  My ramen of choice at Monta was the Shoyo Ramen w/two extra eggs.  This is my favorite type of ramen...silky, thick, and the broth was perfect.  The eggs were cut in half, which gave the extra taste and protein. Taste of my ramen is very similar to what you get at Sora. I didn't try anything else because I was trying to save room for dessert.  Come to think of it, I didn't even finish my ramen.  The rest of the group ordered a mixed bag. I'm sure it was good for them too because everything was demolished.    The restaurant itself is small, like Fukumimi.  This wasn't huge deal because it wasn't busy at the time.  But be warned, it got super busy after we left. Overall, I have to give Monta 4 stars because of service, quality eats, and close to one of my gyms.

{"text":"You like Monta in Chinatown? Then you will like it here too.   Same menu as they have in Chinatown, same fast service, and same good food. Great lunch option if you work nearby like me. This location is newer than Chinatown and is super clean and has a very nice build-out to it. Ill be back for sure, and if you haven't come by yet give it a try. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I heart the pork belly bowl. Enough said!"}
{"text":"here goes the most boring review ever...you ready?   It's Amazing"}
{"text":"The PHO was great and the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna was very good. The environment was great and the food was great as well. The service was ok are waiter Lina of fell off so another waitress started checking on us. Besides that is what very good and very recommended."}
{"text":"NO. Just NO. So may options in this town to be wasting your time and money here:  : Small_ You will wait and wait and wait unless your one   Pricey in terms of giving you a NORMAL sized Ramen. (Sora, Jinya)   Small portions   They charge you for EVERYTHING. Egg, onions, etc...   They lie about the prices. (Everything on the menu is NOT what they will charge you.  Importantly: They are ALWAYS on the BUSY BUSY attitude. (No real acknowledgment of service) more like a job. Most importantly the BROTH. Seriously no flavor. I like my Ramen with a unique flavor or options of meat and spices....All that (spice) is on the table with no labels.  Ramen can be great and enjoyable. (Great Broth with Buttery noodles, Meat with Broth) Almost Heavenly done right! My I dont understand Monta when there is sooo much good Ramen in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A long time ago, I enjoyed the original Monta Ramen. It was my first ramen experience. As I explored more ramen places and revisited Monta, it fell out of my favor (although I haven't bothered to update my review). However, Monta Chaya earned a shot at redeeming its sister because another Yelper, I believe Christopher S., said that I should the miso ramen. Yes, the miso of Monta Chaya, not OG Monta.  So this was actually my fallback after my original plan fell through due to insane crowds. I managed to work my way over here around 7:30pm on a Monday evening and found a pretty busy dining room, but with just enough vacant seating for me and the party ahead of me. While waiting to be seated, I was able to appreciate the larger dining room and the brighter decor in comparison to Monta 1.0, while still keeping the clipboard waiting list that we all know and love.  The miso ramen ($7.25) with no add-ons took at least 15 minutes to come out, I suppose owing to the busy restaurant and the popular appetizers that I was watching the cooks assemble from my bar-style seating. The broth was enjoyable overall and not as salty in flavor as the typical miso ramen dashi, but it reminded me of a miso soup typically served as an appetizer a little too much. The best miso broths that I've enjoyed have more layers of flavor. The chashu pork was pretty fatty and probably is still the standout of their ramen. The noodles weren't noticeably overcooked, which would have been an automatic negative considering the standard of good ramen even in Vegas. The kikurage was also good, but the bamboo shoots were lacking in flavor and juiciness, probably due to being taken from a can or rehydrated.  I did enjoy the miso ramen overall, enough to order it again or even to try the tonkotsu of Monta 2.0, but there are definite weaknesses that dissuade me from recommending this as anything more than a neighborhood ramen restaurant. Fukumimi Ramen and Ramen Sora are certainly still my favorites."}
{"text":"You have to try the buns! They are my weekly indulgence, and they are an ancient cure for hangovers!!!   The noodles are amazing, along with everything else on the menu! Highly recommended. The staff are always professional and attentive. I am so lucky to live nearby."}
{"text":"Really good ramen. It was 8:30pm and the place was packed and had a half-hour wait. It was worth it. The cost is pretty reasonable and the food was excellent. A great little ramen shop that is worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Shoyu ramen (basic ingredients), daikon salad, fried shishito peppers.  I enjoyed the ramen over all, but the noodles were rather ordinary--just a bit better than store-bought cooktop ramen, and for some reason they were rather short--no long slurps needed. The broth wasn't too salty for me, the pork was nice, and it's a good-sized bowl.  The salad was tasty.  This was my first time trying shishito, and I didn't know how most of them are mild, but you will randomly find a hot one.  I think there were three that were spicy, with the last one on the plate being hottest. I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Ok here's the deal.... NBD, but I'm the #1 regular at this spot.  When I go there today, it will mark my 40th checkin in 3.5 months.  That being said, it doesn't really matter if you eat there or not because I am single-handedly keeping the lights on.  OK but if you're interested in how good it is (besides the fact that my calculated annual expenditure for ramen at Monta is literally four thousand dollars).... just go and try it.  Or don't.  For all your ramen are belong to me!!!  Love this place.  The food, SUPER friendly service *every* *stinking* *time*, it's fast, inexpensive, and just yummy as all hell.  So get out and try this place, because I'm seriously considering just buying the joint and hogging it all to myself....!"}
{"text":"They are closed MON-FRI 2:30-5 but SAT-SUN 11:30-11, REALLY WISHING IT WAS SAT or SUN to get my Ramen on..... Guess I'll find another place in the area."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Japanese ramen and you're in Las Vegas..this is the place to go! Monta Chaya is located in south Las Vegas, so its only minutes away from McCarran Airport/the Las Vegas strip / and Henderson residents.  We had a party of four and went to Monta around 10pm. Our server was Joseph and he gave us excellent service.. His knowledge about the food and the restaurant make us want to return here..everything we ordered was made perfect..."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Tried to go to this place 2 days prior but was on a time crunch and it was so busy we couldn't wait... so when we had more time we went back. We went there with a large group at 1200 and had to wait a little bit but well worth it! I got the spicy ramen and added egg, seaweed, onion and garlic ... it hands down the best ramen I have had.  Also had green tea- only bummed because it was in a can and nit refilled .. but it still tastes good. Also order the goyza also good!   Recommend to get there early because this place seems to be always packed! I will for sure go back next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this noodle restaurant. I used to live in Japan for two years and loved eating ramen there. This place knows how to make ramen the way ramen is supposed to be made! I love the Miso and Shoyu the best, but all are quite delicious. For sides, I recommend the kimchee fried rice and bbq pork buns. All quite tasty. This location isn't as busy as the one in Chinatown on Spring Mountain, so whenever I am in the area I make an effort to stop by."}
{"text":"This was my very first Ramen house I've ever experienced and so far I've been coming back for years. After all these years I'm now going to review this place.   Off the bat, when you walk in it's a pretty small restaurant like any typical ramen house. So simple and cozy. Sat down ordered right away.   Appetizers  Kimchi fried rice ($3.95) was so tasty, not salty at all. Calamari ($3.95) was different from your usual calamari with the cocktail sauce and lemon, but this one had a Japanese tempura batter with a sweet and vinegary sauce which was good and light.  Drinks I've only gotten the green tea (Hot) $ 1.75 which was in a can and was already hot. That was interesting to me because I've never had a hot drink in a can, but I did see that in Japan they have vending machines with hot drinks. It's a Japan thing I guess. I LOVE IT!   Ramen  Tonkotsu and Miso ($6.95)  Both Ramens were 5 stars!!!! I can't get enough of this. I can't even explain how tasty it is. Not at all salty and seems very light. I always get Nori ($.75), Nitamago (egg) $1.50, corn ($.50), and butter($.50) as my toppings! Soooooooo yummy. The broth is PERFECT  So why the 4 stars? Well I gave it a 4 because a few times we've gone, has been a 30 to 45 min wait and I mean it's not their fault that it's so good and a lot of people want to eat there, but try thinking of investing in a bigger place. I had to drive far to eat at another ramen place which this place is 2 mins away from me.   Overall still my favorite spot for some good ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't taste the miso in the miso ramen I ordered and the gyoza had a strange bitterness to it. The chashu was good though, and just melted in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered the kuro ramen and was happy with it.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating and service is fast. The interiors are also nice. Wouldn't mind going back to try something else."}
{"text":"I like how this location is much closer to me and less busier than the original location. Plus their pork belly bowl melts in your mouth and is always a nice side dish with a bowl of tonkotsu shoyu ramen."}
{"text":"Small and quaint! Big on flavor the best ramen I've had outside of Japan. They open at 11:30 be there by 11:00, Sit at the bar. This place is a secret no more, line out the door by 12:00."}
{"text":"I usually get the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen w/ the seasoned hard boiled egg, corn, butter, and kimchi on the side...it's perfect for this chilly weather. Their pork belly is absolutely delicious! The buttery fat is flavorful and cooked perfectly. They serve it over rice with pickled ginger, which adds a delicious contrast with its sour crunchy goodness.  They are always busy, so be prepared to wait; especially on a Friday or Saturday night. I've waited over an hour before. They need to make this place bigger. That is the only reason why they get 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Embarking on the trek from South Summerlin to Henderson solely to grub down is a major sign that I LOVE the food here. I have been for several Saturday lunches; it's pretty popping. I've never waited over 15 min and trust it is well worth it . We order the Miso Ramen (add egg,$$), Chasu Pork (OUT OF THIS WORLD),  Gyoza (handmade), and fried rice. We also get a few orders of ramen to go as it heats up nicely for a few meals over a chilly week. Just make sure to place the noodles into a separate container. Now I'm hungry ...."}
{"text":"Being from San Francisco/ Bay area in Ca, ramen is tough to beat anywhere else but this place knocks it out of the park.  Absolutely love their ramen and fried rice.  The kimchi fried rice is super good.  Cooked to just the right texture of rice filled with flavor.  The ramen is perfectly chewy and the soup really hits the spot on a cold day! The place is a bit small ans gets crazy busy during nights.  So heed the warning of the other regulars who reviewed on here and go ahead of time to enjoy your dinner!!"}
{"text":"Extra noodles, extra egg, extra meat, another egg and seaweed. That's not too much is it? Yes, yes it is... But I'm still going to order it. Monta ramen is a cheap, filling lunch with such a low base price you don't feel guilty about adding extra toppings (Unless you're a guy that's only survived on top ramen, then maybe this is expensive). Once you have non-99 cent ramen, you'll never be able to go back to those horrible styrofoam cup noodles.  Don't be turned away from Tonkotsu... Just think of it as a deeper flavor than the plain shoyu or miso. Always order tonkotsu :)  The cold noodles they serve is called hiyashichuuka in Japan and they're just as good as the ramen bowls. If you don't feel like eating the super salty ramen bowl, stick to this. It's lighter on the stomach and you won't be drinking gallons of water afterwards.  Monta is as authentic of ramen as you can get in LV. Having lived in Japan, it's not the best I've had, but it's not the worst either. My only complaint is how salty it is. Consider ordering your broth with lower salt. If not, you'll feel horrible afterwards and will need one of those gallon water jugs to quench your thirst. Parking is easy up front and there's a Japanese shop next door to get some snacks for dessert :)"}
{"text":"Very good and great price.  Had no idea where they were but I will be back. Very busy so you know it's not just me that likes it."}
{"text":"My Japanese and Chinese students recommended this place. They have awesome hot tea in steel cans. I had the Miso bowl of Ramen. Delicious! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! After all these years of eating ramen from the top ramen container and now I know I've been doing it terribly wrong. This place and their ramen noodle operation is legit. I would suggest the totkonsu ramen with pork, mustard leaf. I just haven't had really good results with their order on the phone you pick up because something always seems to happen it's not ready or someone else got my order it's kind of frustrating to be honest with you because I really enjoy this spot and one of my favorite places to go but I'm reluctant to order out. Beware if you go in to eat it's the size of a closet so you're going to be rubbing up against people you don't know if you go in there for a quick bite to eat that's why I always eat out."}
{"text":"Monta ramen is probably one of the founding fathers of ramen to hit the Las Vegas area.   Previously, i would frequent the spring mountain location and wait half an hour to be seated and try their delicious ramen; however, this was many years ago.  I was excited that they were opening up a new location in an area not really known for great food spots (Henderson area).  This location is probably slightly bigger than the old location but still not that big.  Getting straight to the point, I really don't like the ramen here.  The broth is consistently thick and oily and quite too often am I downing my water to combat the saltiness of the ramen.  You can ask them to cut down on the salt content but it really doesn't make a difference.    Overall: The broth is really thick and oily making it difficult to get that warm refreshness comparable to having a nice hot bowl of pho.  If you want good hip ramen thats not salty, oily or thick I would highly recommend going to Jinya."}
{"text":"I'm not that much into noodle houses, but I really enjoyed this one. I've been here twice and each time my dish was delicious! The staff is awesome too, really friendly and attentive. I recommend taking a date here.The place is cute (^.^) and quiet enough for couples to talk and enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"hubby and i took our cuzzen here ...lunch time of course theres a waiting time. you have to sigh in...i understand...but noone there to say how long. then we when we were called in ...the hostess/waitress- NO smile on face, didnt understand a word what we were asking and got our order wrong. never came by to check on us. i had to call each time to ask for more water. their dishes were too salty or just too much base for the soup. their sister restaurant was a little better BUT i dont think they understand when i ask for extra soup base or extra hot water. oh and i cant get my soup without noodles or replace it with extra negi with an extra charge. all in all...havent stepped back into a Monta anything since ...coz we found Ramen Sora!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now and out of all the ramen spots I've tried this is the only reasonably good ramen spot here in Vegas. Food is good & always hits the spot, service is fast & friendly. They have two locations one on Eastern & one on Spring Mountain and the service/food is the same. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ramen is always a good pick me up. The miso ramen here is my favorite. I have also had there fried rice, but who are we kidding. Who goes to a ramen place to order rice? haha  A friend of mine questioned me when I introduced him to ramen. \"Why would you go out to eat ramen when you can buy a packet at the market for a quarter?\" WELL, lets just say he regrets that statement after eating here and we have been back several times."}
{"text":"My sis who lives in Henderson recommended this place for ramen.  I'm from Hawaii where ramen shops are literally in every corner.  I've tried them all.  Not to say that I am an expert or anything but I do know a good bowl of ramen when I see one.  The restaurant is kind of hidden so you could walk past it if you weren't paying any attention.  We came by for lunch around 12 noon on a Wednesday.  It is a small restaurant probably seating around 20 or so people.  We had to wait till everyone in our party arrived to be seated at a table.  Which was kind of ridiculous because there wasn't anyone else waiting other than ourselves.   They could have started our drink and appetizer orders while we waited for our last guest to arrive.   When we finally got around to being seated and placed our order, we got fried calamari, chashu buns, shoyu ramen, pork belly bowl.  The pork belly bowl was pretty yummy.  It is over rice and is so flavorful that it made my tastebuds happy.  The shoyu ramen was your basic bowl of ramen.  It's decent, no complaints here.  I wasn't too fond of the chashu buns tho.  After having chashu buns from Bachi Burger, a burger joint nearby, nothing compares...now that's what I call yummy goodness!!!  Monta needs to take some tips from them.    Overall, I felt that service was ok.  Food was good, the pork belly bowl is probably their prized dish.  I would most likely order that the again the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Been here three times. The first time and second time I went the service was good. However, the third time I came here was all wrong.  I finished my water before food came out. When my food came I couldn't even drink (no water). I placed it on the side hopefully a server will see. My friend offered his water and I killed it. Server passed by refilled his water that was almost hidden and left mine in the corner not filled. My friend offered his drink twice and they didn't even refill after I asked. Had to ask twice. Hopefully next time I go. Service would be better. Food is still good."}
{"text":"2nd branch of Monta Ramen.  Exactly like Monta in terms of food, with a few appetizers that I've never seen being served at the Spring Mountain location.  Same flavorful broth, same generous noodle portions.  It's slightly bigger and cozier than Monta, but I'm not sure how full it gets because I've never eaten here during peak hours.  They're also closed in the afternoon, from 2:30-5:00, which is a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Tasty ramen and great menu items. Small place with small menu but good food. Prices are pretty reasonable.  Finally another Monta! The other location is always packed so its nice to have another option. This location needs to perfect the taste like the other Monta has."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor one of my top fav ramen places in town. Had the shoyu ramen with goyza appetizer... Delish!"}
{"text":"A great ramen spot in Henderson! I came in for dinner with a friend and we both enjoyed our ramen. It's great to have an excellent local ramen restaurant for times when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown.   The restaurant is not very large inside so we had a short wait for seating on a weeknight. There is a sign in sheet at the door where you add yourself to the waiting list and specify a preference for table or counter.   The employees were on top of their game. Everyone was working hard to keep up with the steady stream of customers. The employees were on top of tracking the waiting list for seats, refilling drinks, and delivering food to the tables quickly. Everyone we encountered was friendly as well.   My friend and I started with Green Tea, Crispy Rice, and Shishito Peppers. The green tea was served hot in a can which was a first for me. It was not the best green tea I've ever had, but it was pretty good. The Crispy Rice had great flavor and the crispy rice held together great making it easy to eat. The Shishito Peppers were delicious as well and had a nice sauce on top. Only a few peppers in the batch were hot, but for the most part it was a mild pepper.   Both of us went for the Spicy Tonkostu Ramen and it didn't disappoint in taste or spice. I loved the broth and couldn't get enough of it. The broth is more milky than some of the other ramen spots I've eaten at and I enjoyed the difference. Everything inside the bowl was delicious as well. The noodles were tasty, the meat was tender, and the egg was perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"As my friend Gayle Y says... who goes to a ramen place to order fried rice?!   ME! Lol. I always get the fried rice.. I just love the combination of pork belly with rice and green onions. I do like the tonkotsu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen though. Prices are pretty fair (~$7-9), seating is limited, and parking can be limited. Longer wait on weekends."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place, I go there every time for the pork belly bowl and it never fails to satisfy a craving. Great little hole in the wall, family friendly atmosphere. Gets a little busy on the weekends but if you want some simple Japanese food than this is your place. Their ramen is also pretty amazing, the amount of food that you get for the price is a darn good deal. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"My buddys are local and hit this spot up on the reg. Went in for some eats on a Saturday nite. There were a few parties ahead of us yet the food looked delicious so we gladly waited. Oh what a mistake that was. Wound up getting food poisoning. (Yes it was in fact from the bowl I got here and not via alcohol or any other food. We were at home the rest of the nite. This was all I had to eat / drink last night besides water.) Never again. Fair warning for you Yelpers."}
{"text":"Treat your taste buds with Monta ramen!  This is definitely one of the top ramen shops I've ever been to.  I was staying in the strip with my friends when we accidentally came here instead of the Monta ramen shop in Chinatown.  It turned out to be an awesome experience.  We started off with pork buns.  The chashu pork is balanced well with fat and meat.  The bun is soft and everything melt in your mouth.  The tonkatsu-shoyu ramen.  Two thumbs up.  My friend also raved about the tonkatsu with black garlic oil.  I added extra chashu pork and an hard boiled egg.  Pretty soon I reached ramen nirvana.  The fatty chashu pork was well seasoned and  flavorful.  If you are still hungry, go for the pork belly bowl.  More fatty pork mixed with scallions.    Come to Monta ramen for your ramen cravings.  If you are staying on the strip, this is 20 minutes away versus the closer one in Chinatown."}
{"text":"\"Gomenasai\" (sorry) should be the phrase that's yelled out instead of \"irasshaimasu\".  \"Gomenasai, we're still too small to accomodate large parties.\"  \"Gomenasai, you have to wait 40+minutes when it's busy to be seated.\" \"Gomenasai, we opened a second location and still subjecting you to the same wait hype crap of the other location.\" \"Gomenasai, we only offer canned sodas.\" \"Gomenasai, there are only 2 servers working the floor and will ignore your pleas for water refills.\"  I wasn't in a big hurry to try the ramen here, especially after experiencing the ridiculous wait of the other location that's smaller than my pantry. I don't think the ramen is that good to put up with the hassle. When we were finally seated after much confusion on the part of the hostess that only prolonged our purgatory, we ordered the fried rice, miso and shoyu ramen with nitamago and nori.  The noodles were ok, but I prefer the noodles from Shoku (but not their salty broth), the pork was tender, albeit slimy and fatty but strangely good. The broth was ok. It would have been nice to see a spicy miso on the menu. The fried rice was good and had the nice hibachi flavor and gone in about 3 spoonfuls. Food overall was ok, but waiting 40 minutes in a cramped space is not the right way to start off an experience. I know, it's how most ramen houses are, but it's annoying. Gomenasai."}
{"text":"Honestly very upset this place is closed. It was mine and my boyfriends all time favorite ramen place in the area. But it's been closed for basically this entire year, last time they were open was like March of 2017. Never gave any notice either. Just all the sudden closed. Reasoning on door was suspicious as well, claimed remodel and now moving locations? CONVINCED they closed because health care violations, frequently found dirty glasses and bowls or plates of food and even left over marks on forks. Tables were almost always sticky. Service is slow and thus makes the facility crowded and wait was always 20+ minutes"}
{"text":"Tried this place again after having a craving for some noodles, I don't know what changed but the ramen was delicious, packed full of sodium but it was oh so good! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good, cheap meal. The pork belly boil was also amazing for anyone who doesn't like soup."}
{"text":"One of THE best Ramen in Las Vegas.  I've been coming to this location since it opened. It's a lot closer to where I live than the Monta on Spring Mountain by the strip.  I always order the Shoyu Ramen and add the nitamago (egg), it is my absolute favorite! The service is always fast and the ramen comes out steaming hot and delicious.  If I'm extra hungry I'll order the gyoza for an appetizer which is very good, comes out fried.  If you want your broth to be more flavorful, for a little extra you can request for the black garlic oil and/or the spicy red paste. Both are fantastic and you can add to your liking.  I've tried to venture out and try different Ramen, but I honestly believe nowhere compares to Monta. I always find myself wishing I had just gone to Monta instead.  The only negative thing about Monta is the wait. Since it's such a small restaurant (as is the one on Spring Mountain) there usually is a wait whenever I go. Anywhere from 15 min to 45 min. Good thing the ramen is so tasty here - it's always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of eating at Monta. Both locations are excellent. Eastern location is larger."}
{"text":"I love Monta Ramen but their lines are so long and wait time is just plain aggravating. This location is south and between the 215 and 15. its much more quiet and still the same great quality. We had the black garlic oil with our ramen. The soup is exactly the same as the Monta Ramen!"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen, made me ask myself wth was I eating at home lol. So much flavor it was best. I purchased the pork and chicken flavor and I recommend this place to anyone seeking ramen"}
{"text":"Great ramen, the best we found in vegas so far. Especially cold yuzu noodles - are my favorite. Ok a cold day as today, however, I've had miso ramen. It was pretty good. The place was packed around noon on Sunday. Service is good. The only issue was excessive waiting - first for a table, then for food. But the food was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Always busy throughout the day, if you need a ramen fix here is the place to be!   They have variety of soup base favors to choose from and toppings to add on. Parking is a hassle because it's in a plaza and there's lots of stores around"}
{"text":"Love this spot! I always order the Miso Ramen which is creamy & delicious and really perfect if you're feeling under the weather. I add 2 slices of extra pork & corn which makes it extremely filling along with all of the noodles! My only complaint is that both times I've ordered the gyoza (potstickers) some are cooked more than others. The meat inside some gyoza was bright pink which immediately turned me off, and this has happened BOTH times I've ordered them. Now I know better and just order fried rice on the side instead."}
{"text":"This place has some excellent ramen, I enjoyed the shoyu ramen. It has good broth and noodles, plus the price was right. Only thing was it didn't have much seating, but a lot of good food places don't."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! Great customer service... We bring out 2 1/2 year old toddler all the time, they are accommodating and friendly - always remembering to bring her a small bowl and plastic spoon! Food is awesome! Best fried rice and ramen in town!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened up this location. There wasn't a crazy long line like the one on spring mtn and we went there on a Saturday afternoon. In fact, there was no wait at all and we were seated immediately. Their ramen is delicious and full of flavor. This place hit the spot and will definitely be my new ramen go to place."}
{"text":"A clean, intimate, and delicious spot to satiate your ramen appetite. The creamy miso broth tasted excellent with the long, chewy, hair extension-like noodles that accompanied it. Portions are generous and I had trouble finishing it all. A bowl alone is inexpensive, but the additional toppings are egregiously expensive. A soft boiled egg or green onions will cost you $1.50 each. So that $6.95 basic bowl could cost upwards to $10+ if you go World Star on toppings. Just sayin'. The green tea was sadly served via can and not homemade. Oh well, I've always left satisfied and inflated with happiness."}
{"text":"Fast service Tasty broth Delicious fried rice, that I was supposed to take home but ended up eating with the bowl of ramen haha carbs on carbs!"}
{"text":"Joe is an excellent server. His customer service is awesome. He always has a smile, is very friendly, and knowledgeable.   I love eating at Monta Chaya. The food is great. The price is just right. The staff is friendly.   I recommend the miso ramen, the pork belly bowl, and the fried rice.   At times there can be a nice long wait but in my opinion that's a good thing. That just means that the food is good and they are doing something right. Especially since there are a lot of returning customers, myself included."}
{"text":"Ummm wow, noodle galore.  All these East side noodle joints...I'm in heaven!!  We were on our way to our favorite Japanese store to pick up some Hamachi Kama and Char Siu, when we see Monta Chaya.  We seriously put the brakes on and said, \"Is this a dream?!\"  Ooh my, but it wasn't.  Monta is in our hood, with the classic bowls of ramen and then some!  Jesse N. and I went semi all out, haha.  I say semi because we could of ate more.  We indulged ourselves in Chasu Buns, a mini Mentaiko Bowl, and I had the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen with Kim Chee and Nori on the side.  Ooooh weee!  Love the decor and the atmosphere, looks like they already have a few regulars too.  How did I miss this?!    Chasu Buns I must admit, wasn't as appetizing as my ramen or Mentaiko Bowl.  It could of been more on the steamy/hot side, that was my only complaint, still give it a go.  Mentaiko Bowl, eggs and rice, I'm talking fish eggs and rice to get your appetite going and top it off with the delicious tasting ramen that most Las Vegas Yelpers love?!  Sweeeet!    Great side to this is this place can fit a little bit more people than the Spring Mountain location.  We luckily didn't have to wait, but I did pass a sign in sheet by the door.  My noodle lovers, its a must go!"}
{"text":"Decor: modern Asian lunch counter. Apps: chicken karaage was 90% fat and gristle; the gyoza tasted just like you'd expect. Condiments:  The soy sauce on the table was quite frankly the saltiest either of us have ever tasted.  No sriracha sauce, but they offered their own version for a dollar.  Ramen:  The miso and tonkatsu ramen broth had very good flavor and the noodles were cooked properly.  The chashu was nothing more than fat held together by collagen.  Pretty gross.  Overall, this is a ramen joint and the ramen is good.  The proteins were horrible on our visit.  We might give them another shot for the noodles."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original Monta but with even more menu items.  They have quite a few appetizers and I have tried many of them.  Both of the salads are great, a daikon one and a cabbage one.  The shishito peppers are yummy and the karrage is good.  Not as busy as the other location so you luckily don't have to wait as often."}
{"text":"I have never been to Monta Ramen, just to preface.  I noticed when this place was being renovated as I am regularly shopping at Japan Creek Market.  I finally visited last night for a late Sunday dinner by myself.  There are purse hooks underneath the bar which is AWESOME!!!  I ordered the cold noodle (Hiyashi Chuka) with yuzu sauce sans pork, the shishito peppers, and the mini mentaiko bowl.  I also ordered hot tea, which was the can of tea listed under cold drinks, heated!  Very Japanese-drink machine-like.  I received the shishito peppers first, which were deliciously charred in a miso sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled about.  I enjoyed this dish very much, and it is a good price.  Next, I got the mini mentaiko bowl.  The mentaiko was very fresh, and the bowl was covered in my favorite vegetable, green onions, plus shredded nori!  I added some shichimi, sesame oil, and soy sauce to this and mixed everything in the rice.  Lastly, my hiyashi chuka was delivered to my spot at the bar.  I did not realize at first that it had pork on it (my picture was taken before I realized it) - oddly enough, the pork looked somewhat like shiitake mushrooms, albeit large ones.  I asked the server for a plate and removed the pork with a spoon onto the plate - the pork had been cold and was not moist or drippy so it was not worth sending the dish back.  The noodles were presented with shredded cucumber, tomato slices, seaweed, bamboo shoot, bean sprouts, and shredded egg crepe strands with sides of karashi (Japanese mustard) and benishoga (pickled ginger) in a yuzu sauce.  The sauce is OISHI!!!!  I finished my shishito and mentaiko and started working on the noodles when I got some bad news about my brother in the hospital and no longer felt like eating.  The servers brought me some water and helped me package up my meal to take home.  I really appreciated the kind service.  I get to enjoy my leftovers for lunch today.  I will definitely return.  Credit card minimum is $10."}
{"text":"Most people who know me well would say that I am OBSESSED with noodle dishes of any kind, and ramen is on my top 3. I can literally enjoy a bowl of ramen (or two) every single day and not get tired of it. However, my experience at Monta Chaya was not as heavenly as I had hoped.   I ordered the tonkatsu/shoyu broth and although ramen is traditionally pretty salty and high in sodium content, this was too much for me. The broth was so unbelievably salty that I couldn't even enjoy the noodles in the bowl. I've had tonkatsu ramen and shoyu ramen in ramen-yas in LA, NYC, and Vegas, and I must say... here their broth is a bit too thick and heavy, the saltiest of them all! Basically, I ALWAYS get double the noodles at ramen-yas. This time, I had no desire to order kaedama.   I've always spoke highly of the gyoza at the original Monta on Spring Mountain Rd., and I was excited to order some during my visit to the new location; however, the waitress informed me that the new gyoza is deep-fried... :*(, so I chose to live without it. When I saw a plate of gyoza being delivered to another table, I saw that it's definitely nothing like the amazing gyoza served on Spring Mountain. That's a real shame! The gyoza in the original Monta is NUMBER ONE in Vegas, in my book.   The karaage was a HUGE disappointment. The breading was bland and the chicken inside was stringy. The steamed pork buns were \"O-K\". We've had much better ones in various Chinese restaurants.   The other big negative is that they do not offer one spicy-flavored broth. To me, there are very few things that are more incredible than a large bowl of spicy ramen, especially when the spicy is done right (cough, ramen sora, cough cough.)  All in all, I know Monta and Monta Chaya are huge hits in the Vegas ramen-eating community, and I can respect and understand why; however, it is not my cup of tea. I would go to the new Ramen Tatsu for my tonkatsu broth cravings and Ramen Sora for ... pretty much everything else :)."}
{"text":"I finally got hungry around 1pm and just like the first-to-review person, I also missed the lunch rash. Because who wants that?  I was happy to discover that they are serving Hiyashi Chuka. It's every bit as good as the OG Monta location on Spring Mountain. The service was quick. Sitting at the counter, I was able to see the guy making my dish right in front of me. He apologized for the wait, but it really wasn't much of one.  My only possible gripe is that I could have sworn the dish said $7.25 on the menu; I was charged $7.95. Not worth complaining about, so I just paid cash and left.  I'll be back, especially since this is a good lunch distance for me. Just no rash, please."}
{"text":"Really excellent ramen, somewhere in my top 5 ever.  My husband said it was his #1 in Vegas.    My miso ramen was on the lighter end (compared to, say, a typical tonkatsu) but really flavorful.  The chashu here is too fat-to-meat ratio for my taste but prepared perfectly, it has a good flavor and was not tough or old.  Salt level was just right for me.  His kuro ramen was also great, not too oily, just right.  Could have had just a touch more garlic.  We were both a little surprised at the very thin noodles, but are okay with them.  I was a bit annoyed that there was nowhere near enough broth for kaedama to be possible.  Basically they only sell what I would consider to be a \"small\" ramen (or maybe right between a small and medium).  But I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Me and my husband go to Japan several times a year and monta has been the only ramen spot that actually tastes authentic to the real deal"}
{"text":"Staff were so friendly! I work in customer service so I know how customer service can make it or break it. It has the ability to convince the guests to return to your business. Our server was very energetic and kind and did not forget to check up on us. Both our server and even one of the chefs said thank you for coming and good bye once we were finished with our food. It made the ramen taste that much better! ;) Will definitely come back again. I was very pleased that Monta opened up in the area!"}
{"text":"That was VERY good! My wife and I tried two different Ramen. Both were very tasty and satisfying. Servers even brought out a small bowl so that our 2.5 year old could enjoy...which she did!   Crispy rice topped with spicy tuna goodness also made my belly happy.   Everything was clean and friendly; my kind of place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! the only reason why i am giving it a 4 star rather than 5 is because the place is so small that sometimes the wait time is long.. BUT totally worth the wait ! & also one star down because of the slow service ! the last time we went there, we only saw our server when it was time to get the check..  They definitely need to improve on that.  Other than that, everything is great.  Great price, great atmosphere, great quality of food !"}
{"text":"Oh man, even when you're not craving ramen, it is SO good that you won't stop thinking about it...until you have more ramen. First of all, difficult to locate, but they've literally been open for a week, so I'm sure a sign is coming soon. Seriously though, everyone has still managed to find it! Anyway, a couple notes: very small spot and they will only seat you if your whole party is there, so plan ahead! Ruben and I joined our friends and their kids to dinner. We ordered a bunch of items and shared bites.   I ordered the Fried Calamari and Charshu Bans from the Chaya menu. The calamari is very lightly breaded and fried, then served with a delicious Japanese broth. So, so good. The Charshu Ban was just okay for me. Weirdly served with a leaf of Iceberg lettuce? Anyway, for my main entree, I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with their \"thick, wavy noodles\" (normally comes with their thin noodles, but I asked if I could order it with the thick noodles and they were more than happy to accommodate!). I wasn't feeling adventurous enough for toppings, however, I really enjoyed adding the condiments available at your table like sesame seeds, vinegar, and most importantly, the spicy sesame oil. A fabulous addition of flavor and the right amount of spice to your broth! At our table, there was also the Miso Ramen (I'm torn between this broth and the Tonkotsu Shoyu), Fried Rice, and Pork Belly Bowl. All really, really good!  Anyway, food was quick and service was wonderful. Everything was on point and it was such a lovely experience. I can't wait to have another bowl!  UPDATE: Of the three major ramen houses in the valley, I prefer Monta's thick, wavy noodles, Tonkotsu-Shoyu broth, and chili oil for an extra kick. Ramen Sora is a close second with a superior Miso broth."}
{"text":"Wow, I had the worst food poisoning after having the cold noodle plate & flashed fried Japanese peppers. I suspect it it the cold noodles. I hope others have been luckier!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite place to eat now. The service is so quick, so even when you don't get seated right away, you never have to wait long. Then soon after you order, your food is out. I take everyone I know here. I eat here so much I wish they had punch cards for bowls of ramen lol"}
{"text":"I'm not an experienced Ramen diner, but this was delicious.  My only knock, which only stopped me from a five, I'll talk about later in my review.   I had the Spicy Tonkotsu and Karage (fried chicken pieces).    The broth was amazing and so full of flavor.  The noodles were a little different and I liked it.  I've only been to a couple of other Ramen restaurants and the noodles tended to be more plump and soft.  These were slightly thinner and more al dente which I actually think works better.   The Chashu (braised pork) in the soup was amazing!   The Karage was good, pretty much what I've had at other places, but they didn't offer any sauce with it.  Now, I don't know if it's standard to offer sauce or if that's more for us Americans.    Service: My first issue was when I arrived.  Nobody from the staff greeted me and each time someone came to the waiting area they just acted like I wasn't there, so I basically just stood around for a few minutes.  There was even a guy at the host stand when I arrived and never said a word to me.    I work in the industry and you need to at least say, \"Hello, we will be right with you\" so I know you've acknowledged my existence and I'll get seated.  I apparently got there right before the lunch rush, so it was on the verge of getting busy.    My server wasn't great, but there was another server who checked in on me and did more than my actual server.  Because I'm not really experienced with Ramen, I don't know a lot about ingredients, the sauces on the table, etc... The server made me feel so rushed I couldn't even get any questions in.  She also got my Ramen order SLIGHTLY wrong.    Look, it gets super busy in there, I get it.  That doesn't mean you should rush your guests.  I would have given five stars."}
{"text":"Walked in got greeted, sign in !   This place is so small . This will be my second time coming back here waiting . I'll wait it out to give it a try .   Hopefully the wait till be worth it .   Got seated at the bar after 15 minutes .   Ate Shoku Ramen & I wanna test this one out .   SERVER: Mariah   Mariah is VERY sweet & nice ! She knew everything about what the menu was !    Kitchen was very clean . The chef's used gloves like OTHER restaurants should be using , is GLOVES !   Ordered the spicy tonkotsu w/ Ni Tamago .   Krispy Rice: Mmmmm ! 110% bomb ass rice.   OMG , the wait was worth it ! This is BOMB ! I will be back . Mom fried rice was on point ! The server Mariah herself was on point . Mmmmm !"}
{"text":"Finally!   I love that Monta Chaya is just within a 5 min radius from where I live and work! I had the pork belly  bowl today and all i can say i s yum! I also tried the karaage - it was nice, crispy and freshly cooked but I think i'll stick to the ramen, chiarsu or pork belly bowls for lunch and leave the karaage and the rest of the Chaya offerings for happy hour over a drink or two."}
{"text":"5th week it's been open and we have gone every week! Same owner as Sushi Mon, Goyemon & Monta Ramen and just as good. It's not as busy yet but just wait as it is just a matter of time till you have to wait at all hours. If you get extra noodles for your leftovers you can also get extra broth and they will put it in 2 containers so your noodles don't get soggy."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! But the food, for the price I expected a lot more. Had the Sriracha fried rice and  it was tasty but for 6.95 that's too small a portion for rice. Rice is cheap. That size dish should of been 4.99. Had the pork ramen it was tasty and the size big enough and tasty but it came with two slices of pork which was advertised so yes it was good but I felt for the price??? Not enough value. Also order the vegetarian soup. I should of read more carefully.  It's noodles in soy milk. Felt like we were eating cereal with noodles and corn.  Two thumbs down on the vegetarian option. The vegetarian option did not taste good. Again the rice and pork ramen was tasty. Also those where the lowest quality chopsticks you can get. However I feel I did not get enough value for what we spent."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place from all the reviews on here.  Honestly, it was good, but not \"knock my socks off\" good. I have had better.   I met my friend here and when I arrived, we were seated upon my arrival. The place is not big at all, but you're not crammed in one area either.  Space is just right.  And it was clean.   The lady who was our server was very kind and took our drink order in no time.  Service was quick and personable.  Within no time we placed our orders and had our ramen.  I added nori to my bowl, which cost .75. Some other places I have been to offer a wider selection of vegetables, which is what I would have like to see.  My standard bowl was just with mushrooms, bamboo shoots and green onions.   When you're done with your bowl, and you want more ramen, the charge is $1.50.  Of course I had to get more because I love ramen! They bring it to you in a separate bowl, and you dump in into your broth. Pricing is not decent.  My friend had a bowl, Gyoza and I had ramen, fried rice and extra noodles, and our total came out to $27.   All in all I would go back because this place is relatively close to my house.  Will definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with Monta when I'm craving ramen! Tonkatsu shoyu is a must try! The broth is heaven and their pork is delicious! I always get a side of eggs and corn. The place is small and seating is limited. The wait ranges from 3-10 minutes sometimes."}
{"text":"Monta is one of my favorite ramen houses in Vegas. When I heard they opened a new on right by my house, I was extremely ecstatic. It does not disappoint either. All the broth has body and the right amount of flavor. I can even order take out and eat it at home. The steamed buns are magical as well. The staff are friendly and your meal is ready very quickly too. Five stars.."}
{"text":"I forgot to take a picture of my ramen, that's how good it is! Haha!   Their calamari is great, Lightly coated, crisp yet tender! Their kimchi was average.   I had a miso ramen and I loved how flavorful the broth was, yet I did not seem tired after eating the whole bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a soup person which is basically all they have but I loved it! Everything was great and service top notch. I'll go again soon and that's something to say since I never eat soup noodles or any of that normally."}
{"text":"Ok so....went back to Monta and ordered another soup amd a Pork Belly bowl.  Soup was good...hit the spot.  I'd been craving ramen and this was really good...and the pork belly bowl was soooooo good!! Monta Chayahas redeemed themselves.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just tried the spicy tonkotsu. Yummy! Not too spicy, just enough heat to keep you warm. You gotta try it for yourself.  This place isn't set up for a bit crowd keep your parties to no more than four. Good place to sit at the counter."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's tiny but worth it to get some noodles!!! Yum!!! Been her twice and service is awesome."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot. As a Ramen fiend that has been to the best LA and Orange County have to offer, I would say this Ramen can hang with the top spots.   The Tonkotsu Ramen was a good size and broth was delicious. My only complaint would be the noodles are a bit thinner and straighter than I prefer. The Chatsu was soft and melted in my mouth.   The Gyoza was bangin'.   I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Eureka! we found gold!! Drove 5 hours to Henderson/Vegas from San Diego and came straight here based on 1) Yelp suggestion 2) Ramen craving. It was such a wonderful decision! We arrived right when they opened so we were seated by friend staff right away. You may expect some waiting time if you're here on peak hours. Since we were running empty from our trip we had appetizers and a ramen each... try all the appetizers and definitely do not miss the Chasu bans and calamari!! So great!!  I really enjoyed the bar seats as the guys in the kitchen are on it! One guy stares at the clock all day making sure our ramen bowls are warmed before fille with the goodies and the soup..oh man the thick delicious soup and the wavy thick noodles ... we came back here again before we left the city, just to make sure we don't miss it too much until next time.  Thank you to the (seriously) friendly staff at Monta Chaya for warming our souls on these cold windy days of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This way our first time eating here. It is a very small place and because of that we had to wait a little bit as we have a child that requires a highchair. The service was excellent and the food was really good. If I have to give a critique I would say the pork dumplings could be crispier but that is just my taste."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I've been to the Decatur & Spring Mountain location before and was delighted to know this location opened up in a separate part of town. We got there around 6:30-7pm and there was about a 15 minute wait. We signed in the wait list and it was packed. Luckily we didn't wait too long before we got seated. We ordered ramen and didn't opt for any of the appetizer options(although we will next time). The waitress was very attentive and refilled our drinks without us even asking. The ramen was delicious. I ordered the tonkatsu, with corn (extra) and extra noodles. The extra noodles were in a separate bowl. I added it to the tonkatsu and it filled the bowl just enough for me to enjoy it. I definitely realized how much more often I need to be coming back to eat here."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just over my ramen phase, I don't know, but this last visit I was very unsatisfied. This time I ordered gyoza and spicy tonkatsu ramen. The gyoza was overly cooked on one side and completely undercooked on the other. When you bit into it, a ton of liquid ran out, and it tasted like it had ZERO salt. I drenched it in my gyoza sauce mix, but it didn't help.   My ramen was okay. They put too much of the spicy sauce in it so it made the broth super thick, heavy and salty. It really tasted like spicy tomato soup. I left wishing I had gotten pho instead. :("}
{"text":"WOW!  If you are liking noodles, and needing a fix of real Ramen, this is truly a great place! I have had Ramen in Japan, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and I must say that I really enjoy the Ramen at Monta Chaya.  Service - 5 Star - The staff here are consistent, friendly, kind and very much professional. They are busy, but treat you like family, help manage your expectations as it is a busy, small and crowded restaurant.  I have been here about 5-6 times now and it is very consistent.  Ambiance - 5 Star - Small, open kitchen, enough room for perhaps 22 people on tables and then perhaps 8-10 at the bar.  Typical small Ramen place but the perfect blend of size and coziness.  Ramen when I learn to eat it in Japan is all about waiting to sit down, ordering your food, eating and slurping while hot, drink all the soup, and then wipe your brow, thank everyone and leave so the next person can sit and enjoy. No socializing here!  Food - 5 Star - Rather than discuss their Tonkatsu Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Miso Ramen, I am just going to talk about the two things that count the most:  The noodles and the broth.  a. Noodles - Perfectly timed cooking on the noodles. They have truly perfected the temperature and the al dente texture of the noodles. I say this is perfect because you barely notice the noodle. It is both delicate and substantial at the same time.  b.  Broth - The noodles do not interfere with the broth which is amazing. Lightly flavored, but full of taste. Nothing is overbearing, it is simply just ichiban. What enjoy about the broth is that it is well balanced. Not one ingredient is overpowering the flavor and to achieve this delicate balance is awesome!  c.  Other stuff - 5 star - They have cold noodles, extras bits and toppings, extra noodles and of course really great appetizers.  The kaarage and the gyoza are really fantastic.   I have to say, besides the great ramen, I really enjoy the staff here. They make you feel welcome and part of the family and that makes me want to keep coming back and bringing more people!  GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"Talking about authenticity, their dishes tasted exactly the same as what I had in Tokyo, Japan. The Chasu rice bowl looks fatty but the taste is just fantastic! Highly recommended. The miso ramen I had is good too but just a little too much salt. Still, this is still a great place for lunch and the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've\"ve been somewhat dissatisfied with the old Monta at spring mountain/Decatur due to its inconsistent quality as well as recent health inspection issues, so I was looking forward to seeing how the new place on the other side of town would be like.  I heard that it was next to Japan Creek, but as I drove by, I did not see any signs anywhere, but I was surprised to find out that the restaurant was virtually full of customers.  How did they find out?  It was nice to see that the new place is about the twice the size of the old place.  The menu was virtually identical, but with additional \"chaya\" offerings such as chicken karaage, daikon salad, hakusai salad and such.    I tried chicken karaage, which was very well done, hot, juicy and tasty.  I liked the daikon salad as I love anything daikon, but it reminded me more of daikon sunomono, and was slightly heavy on vinegar taste as I was expecting more of a sweet sesame dressing kind of thing, but I still liked it.    I also had fried rice, but this was mediocre at best.  It was way too oily IMO.  Well done fried rice should be dry and not wet, as a huge firepower from the grill should burn off the oil as you swing the rice into the air as you mix it in a wok.  I think the chef doesn't have the fried rice cooking mastered yet.  As a matter of fact, quite a bit far from it.    I had tonkotsu ramen and it was virtually identical to that of old Monta.  Not too fatty, but cloudy white tonkotsu broth was better done than the old Monta plagued by inconsistencies in recent months.      I like this place.  I just wish they've opened it in Summerlin instead of Henderson."}
{"text":"Staff was super rude , gave me raw dough for my to go order after I waited 30min after I called in and arrived 20min after I called my food in , horrible service and I wasted my time and dinner gettin raw dough which I never received before with my to go order never coming here again"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Ramen places but I always go back to Monta. When their first location was at Spring Mountain I was always making excuses to make the drive, but ever since this location has opened, I hardly ever go there now.  I have had all of their three Ramen choices plus their specials (kuro, spicy tonkotsu) and I've never had any complaints. It just depends on the day and the reason why I came there (meeting up with friends, quick bite after work before heading home) so I never have a set choice. But no matter what, I am never disappointed.  I like the staff, especially Joe. No matter how busy they are they will always say hi. I know what to expect when I come in and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a good ramen shop so close to my house! Now I don't have to use so much gas. I'm a regular at the Japanese market right next door to it and a few months back I saw them doing construction of Monta Chaya everyday, so you can only guess at my anticipation for it to open. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed one bit.  Sat down with my brother after a long day of work and just wanted to have a good bowl of Tonkatsu-Shoyu ramen and maybe a little extra something something. The waitress, I believe Mariah, was very helpful with telling me what was good. So we went off her recommendations and got Ramen, Kaara-age, shishito, and bbq pork steam buns. I really love this Monta now ."}
{"text":"I like the food but it can be a little salty (which is expected with ramen) but I noticed a few mild inconsistencies. It's also very small so they can have long waits. However I still come back. It's one of the better ramen places in Las Vegas! I still recommend it."}
{"text":"As of yesterday (Tue, April 16), their sign is up! Woooraaaay!  This time I tried Hiyashi Chuka (Cold Noodle) with Yuzu dressing. Healthiest noodle item, in my opinion. Yuzu dressing was very refreshing but it was bit sweet for my taste. I crave this cold noodle even if it's chilly winter night. :D"}
{"text":"Excellent bowl of ramen. Eggs perfect. Broth deep and fatty. Pork excellent. Great and super reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband had the miso ramen and I had the spicy miso ramen. They were both good but the portion is small. We also ordered karage which was even a smaller portion, just 4 small pieces and Asahi beer. All in all, the wait was short on a Friday night and food tasted good."}
{"text":"Service here is amazing! The staff was so friendly! My date was 30 minutes less, and they checked on me to make sure I was doing okay haha  The ramen- delicious! Basic selections to choose from. I like how the menu actually tells you what's in your meal. Other ramen places I've been to have somewhat confusing menus."}
{"text":"Bomb!   I honestly love everything here so I can't even pick a favorite. I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the pork belly bowl. I hate anything with fat on it but this bowl is so amazing, like really really amazing. Kimchi and Takana fried rice are bomb. Calamari and Daikon salad (extra dressing on the side) are bomb, and my fav ramen bowl is Shoyo ramen!!!!!! Can't forget the ramen.    Only thing is that it takes a while to get into the doors during dinner because it's a small restaurant. And they have a minimum of $10 for cards (I hate that)!  Did I mention the pork belly bowl is bomb??"}
{"text":"Okay... This was my very first time trying Ramen. I love Pho and eat it all the time so I had to try this place. I was REALLY REALLY disappointed! The calamari is BLAND! There is no flavor what so ever although the presentation is nice. I forgot which Ramen my cousin ordered for me but it had the one with pork. Okay,... The pork meat was ALL FAT! Couldn't even eat it cuz it was so slimy!GROSS! The soup had flavor but everything was just BLAND! There wasn't any flavor when it came to eating the soup with the noodles.OH! And Whhhut?! No veggies in the soup? I think i'll stick to eating pho instead. BUT, I will give this place 1 star for pretty presentation and nice customer service. I wont go back here though."}
{"text":"Usually get a Ramen but my friend ordered Crispy Rice topped with spicy tuna, Fried Calamari, Mini Mentaiko bowl, and Chashu Buns-steamed pork buns. All great. I will definitely try new things on my own next time."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago. Pretty small and cozy spot. I am told it is bigger than their other ramen spot, Monta Ramen. I don't know, they both seem pretty small. It was fairly empty on this Monday night. So we were seated right away. Service was very quick and friendly. While perusing the menu, a special posted on the wall caught my attention, so I went for that. Call me a sucker for sometimes wanting to try items you wouldn't typically get to taste. I forgot the name. It was a black garlic flavored ramen. It was a nice, hot bowl of blackness woo. Slighty smoky and bitter but savory and not too overpowering. Also had the Takana fried rice. Can't quite describe the flavor of the rice, but it was good. I really enjoyed those two items. Sad to say I live across town and Monta Ramen is alot closer, I might not frequent this place as often as I'd like. Still if I'm in the area, it would definitely be a consideration."}
{"text":"So... excellent ramen. Currently closed for construction. With only a note on the door. They couldn't be bothered to actually make and leave a message on their own voicemail. I would normally give this place 5 stars for their food but sadly, they seem to be overwhelmed with business or inept with how to use an answering machine. This has resulted in countless people driving over and wasting their time. Currently we are starving and just wasted about 30 minutes driving to order our food (due to any sort of outgoing message on their machine)."}
{"text":"I've only had ramen a few times in my life but this place makes me want to change that lol. My experience here was great. Staff was friendly, the environment was clean, and the food was awesome! I will definitely have to stop by more often for my ramen fix! I do have one gripe... what's with the weird hours lol.   Definitely recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"Rudest motherf$&'. Came in early so I can order a lot of food but they won't let me.   if one person, not allowed to sit in a table. If the servers are real Japanese it will be ok, but there Chinese so as usual, rude."}
{"text":"I've said this before about the other location but the broth here is sooo good and the pork is sooooo tender never rubbery never dry falls apart.   The gyoza is ok, I wish they had a better dipping sauce for it.  And finally the staff is on point. When we were there last, after they took out order they checked on us twice making sure everything was good and the check came swiftly.... I wish they had dessert:("}
{"text":"Monta Chaya falls #3 on my list of preferred ramen joints in Vegas and one of the last on my list in all the ramen places ever tried. I've had ramen coast to coast and there is nothing really mind blowing about this place. It really boils down to comfort, convenience, and a quick meal.  My go-to has been the sho-yu ramen, which is comprised of a clear broth of soy sauce and chicken stock. Not too salty at all! Usually, I am miso ramen kinda gal, but the miso and tonkotsu ramens here are a bit disappointing. At first the $6.95 price point seems like a steal, but after adding toppings (egg $1.50 and nori $0.75)...it becomes $9+  Two pieces of chashu come with each bowl of ramen and I must say...it is on the small size; however, it is buttery and melts in your mouth!   Ramen is the perfect remedy for hangovers, colds, and rainy days. When the ramen craving hits, you can find me at other joints for sure. Thank you Monta Chaya for hitting the spot after an indecisive drive down Eastern Ave. Definitely, cured my hangry-ness."}
{"text":"If you're in Henderson and looking for good ramen, this place hits the spot. It's a small space with limited seating so get there before the lunch and dinner rush hours. Their service is speedy and the food is authentic and flavorful. My favorites - the gyoza (crisp exterior and the meat is full of the right seasoning/spices), kimchi fried rice and the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. Make sure to add the egg!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of great ramen places, ippudo, ajisen, etc. and since i was so tired of buffet casino food, I have this place a try.  I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen.  the noodles had a nice bit, but the broth was very salty.  it didn't have that 'creamy' rich texture (gelatin) i was expecting.  except for it being salty, it was rather bland.  it's $7 for the pretty bare bones version, 2 slices of pork.  you basically have to pay for egg, seaweed, corn, extra pork, etc.  for las vegas, i suppose it's okay but doesn't compare at all to the great noodle houses of japan."}
{"text":"The definition of Chaya in Japanese means \"cafe that serves small meals\", but there is nothing small in the flavor and oomph of the meals in this prominent noodle house.  I've had ramen in Chinatown, but it doesn't taste anything like the ones at Monta Chaya!   Tonkotsu Ramen which is Ramen that has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen, its stewed for many hours. The soothing rich and creamy pork broth is heaven is a bowl.    If that doesn't tickle your fancy, which would seem hard to imagine get the Kuro Ramen,  its Black Garlic Oil, Pork broth, roasted garlic and thin noodles. The garlic wraps the pork flavor like a warm blanket.    Unfortunately, with this unbelievable food comes the inconvenience of waiting +20 min. for my name to be crossed off the list but as the old saying goes \"its worth the wait.\" It's actually not that bad waiting, I usually walk over to the Japanese market next door to view sweet goodies. Prices they charge is very reasonable considering the quality is off the chain.  Definitely put this place in your bookmark!  Monta Chaya is a legitimate noodle house!"}
{"text":"I love ramen! This is one of the best ramen places in Vegas/Henderson. It's even better now that it is so close to my house. This location has a few more items on their menu than the location in Chinatown. My favorite is the Miso ramen or the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen...it depends on which type of noodles I'm craving. Sometimes I do add in takana mustard leaves to my ramen. If I'm hungry a side of steamed gyoza or Kim chee fried rice is delicious!  If its 100+ degrees outside and you want something refreshing, the Hiyashi Chuka with Goma Dressing hit the spot.  The service here is excellent! My drinks are always filled and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Japanese Ramen place in Henderson. Every time I asked my kids where to eat for lunch on weekends, Monta is the #1 pick."}
{"text":"I consider myself a ramen expert. Love it! Coming from Japanese heritage I know my stuff. Only two people know ramen better then me, MY FOLKS. LOL We went to this place with my family and inlays, since we were in Henderson.  Located right off Eastern and the 215. Came here with the whole family at 5:15. Party of 9. We were able to get seated without reservations. This place is pretty small so you need to get there early. Legit Japanese ramen house. We ordered the gyoza, fried rice, kimchi, shoyu ramen, tonkotsu ramen and the shoyu-tonkotsu ramen. DELICIOUS!  Everyone loved the food. My folks said it was \"top notch\". That's a thumbs up from old Japanese people. Says a lot! Prices are very reasonable. Definitely  order the fried rice as a side to compliment the ramen."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this awesome restaurant Wonderful Ramen, I have to say THE BEST in Las Vegas!! Good prices, clean and relax atmosphere, awesome waiters and complements to the nice chef!! Would recommend this place to everybody out there looking for a great experience."}
{"text":"Pork buns were tasty a little on the fatty side but good. Ramen was good seems like the broth on spring mountain is better but overall nit bad. The service was good. Place looked clean."}
{"text":"I've been to Monta Chaya twice now & have enjoyed both trips immensely. The 1st time I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with nori & this last time I decided to try the Shoyu. I def prefer the Tonkatsu & really wish I had gotten that again. The Shoyu while tasty, is lacking the richness that the Tonkatsu has. I actually left still feeling a tad hungry!  Along with the ramen, we ordered the spicy tuna on crispy rice both times & OMG, I dream of that stuff. 4 pieces just isn't enough to satisfy my craving & even if I had an order of it everyday for a year, I would still prob crave it."}
{"text":"After trying the Miso Ramen at their original location, I again confirmed that I am not a ramen person. It just doesn't do anything for me, doesn't appeal to my taste buds. So at this location I decided to go with the Pork Belly Bowl and also the Crispy Rice. The pork belly was decent and the crispy rice was GREAT. Also tried the fried rice and it was alright also. Maybe for ramen lovers this is the place for you, but for people such as myself, bleh! Customer service, however, was good. They were super friendly!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was the best ramen in vegas, but Sora ramen completely blew this place out of the water.  The place is near eastern and serene inside the plaza containing at&t, golds gym and dennys. The inside of the place is set up like most ramen places, small tables and a bar where the chef cooks. All the furniture are wooden. This place is really casual and gets all types of people coming in from the gym, school, and just ramen cravers.  I never really had to wait for a table and their customer service is somewhat decent. Refills on water are sometimes late, but its better late than never. As for the wait time on food it feel almost instant.   The downpart of this place is it's food. I ended up ordering the tonkatsu ramen...and there is where sora starts beating the crap out of monta's standards. The broth from monta is very lacking and has no distinct taste at all. The portion of the ramen isn't so generous, as me and friend finished the whole bowl we still felt hungry. So those are my major gripes about it. One good thing I can say though is their pork is absolutely delicious.   And honestly for the price you're better off going to sora. I always get extra seaweed and at monta they only give you two extra seaweeds, while at sora they give you a bowl full."}
{"text":"the odd thing about this place is I like every dish I tried so far except for their ramen, the cha shao are too thin and small, soup teasted too salty. I recommend the pork belly bowl and the radish salad. unlike other ramen place, they have a lot of small side dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at the establishment on Spring Mountain since it's close to my home. My husband was on the other side of town and decided to phone in a pick up order to bring home. I dont really care for their ramen, but their pork belly has been my favorite. When my husband got home and we sat down to start eating I took a couple bites of the pork rice & immediately told my husband it tasted different than the one on Spring Mountain. He took a couple of bites and agreed. Later on that night my husband was rushing to the bathroom several times. He was like that until 4 a.m. I woke up the next morning not feeling well. Went to work & ended up getting sent home due to throwing up in the garbage can in my back room. Low and behold FOOD POISONING.....  I will never be able to eat at either location ever again... what a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Awesome Monta now has two locations.  Little wait the Spring Mtn with all the same great ramen, and service. Every time the family is back in town Monta is a must stop, and will keep on coming. Hands down best ramen restaurant I have ever had even in all my travels. Keep growing."}
{"text":"*praise hands* My husband and I love this place. He was stationed in Japan for several years and is always looking for a great Ramen spot. We've found our favorite at Monta Chaya. I get the shoyu ramen with corn and butter and he gets the miso ramen with egg and kimchi. Broth is perfect. Fried rice is delicious as well as Gyoza. Service is quick and the waitresses are always attentive. Wish this place was closer but definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Ramen was so so goood. It was delicious for a cooling November night. Sorta too full for the clubs but we managed. The wait can be slightly long, so account for a wait time."}
{"text":"Was recommended by my boss and it was amazing. Had the shishito  peppers to start and they were covered in a delicious sauce. Had the miso bowl as the main course and it had a ton of flavor. Giving only four starts because of the slower service with only having two waitresses for the entire restaurant (half star) and the chashu slices (pork) were fairly small (half star). Will be back when in town again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  After trying their sister store on spring mountain, i was ecstatic about their being one much much closer.  Even though there isn't a ton of seating, somehow the longest wait I've ever had here has roughly been 5-10min.  (maybe I'm just coming at odd times?).  Either way, the ramen is great for my taste buds.  I don't have a ton of experience with ramen, never been to japan or any of that good stuff, but in the end I know what I like, I'm happy as a fat kid with cake when I come here ^_^"}
{"text":"Perfect ramen, perfect service, we visit often. Love love love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a saucy type of person but I do love soup! I haven't tried much ramen places but this place is number one for me. My go-to is usually the shoyu ramen and I've never been disappointed. There's a server there who makes dining in much more enjoyable but I forgot his name. =P   This place is always busy and you're lucky to get seated right away. I haven't been there in awhile but I usually get my ramen fix every two weeks."}
{"text":"Had steamed buns, kimchi fried rice and shoyu ramen for lunch. I'll def be returning. The broth and noodles were on point. The service was fast and the atmosphere was authentic."}
{"text":"Maybe, I'm just not a huge ramen fan since I can make it at home but I thought this place was okay. Service was great and our food came out fast. I just feel like their lacking flavor and they need to add dishes with more personality. My ramen noodles were cooked perfectly but definitely wasn't a fan of the Tonkatsu Shoyu broth. I loved the stick on wood they had for their refrigerator and front door. Never seen that.   PROS: Prices are cheap, cute place, perfect noodles CONS: Food lacks personality and flavor"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed with the takeout. Probably never coming back since there are plenty of other competent ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first time. We had to wait a few minutes to be sat, but nothing too long. I would say the ramen was above average - we got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen and the broth was delicious. The Chashu Bans (Pork Buns) were tasty, but I've had better. Our server was very knowledgeable of the food and we were very impressed. Also, at the end of our meal, the lady apologized to us over and over for us having to wait maybe 10 minutes, which we thought was very sweet of her. All in all, I would rate this a 4/5 because while the food was only above average, the customer service was phenomenal! I would definitely come back just for the service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Addicted. I've never had a bad experience & I'm a huge fan of adding the spicy sauce. Really, it makes it 100x better. Almost all of my friends have loved it too. The one that didn't was just jelly that I found it first. Tommy, I hope you're reading this.  Non-ramen recommendations: Pork Belly bowl & shishito peppers."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to eat!  I sat at the bar and enjoyed talking to other guests and watching the chefs work their magic. I ordered the miso ramen, added egg and requested spicy on the side so I could control the heat. It was pure heaven. The broth!!!  It's amazing! The pork was so tender and delicious. I will definitely be back many times! Love this spot!  What a great addition to Eastern's restaurant row."}
{"text":"We're quite the Ramen eating family and I was a tad disappointed that there was no other meat option other than pork...where's the chicken?  Anyway, it could be that we are use to more options but in comparison to the worst and best Ramen place we've been too, this is average. I would try another place before coming back here. I tried the butter in the Ramen, first time by the way and they do charge you for the butter, it's a side item. I didn't see what the hype was about, it didn't change anything for me.  The three (3) is because it didn't taste bad, it was fine, just not anything exceptional."}
{"text":"Chris and the girls love this location.  I think its ok.  The miso broth is amazing but there is not enough in the bowl. I would like a bowl full of piping hot broth, but this is not gonna happen here, the broth dont even cover the noodles. Been there 3 times already, dont count on it...  The ramen are a bit chewy to my taste and that's because they are not made in house but store baught... yikes, at that price the least they could do is to serve fresh ramen.  Also I love seasoned eggs but they are always served cold instead of warm, I dont get thst either...  We tried the mini pork sandwich and my question is... where is the meat?!!!  This place is just ok, definitely overpriced for the size of the portion and the quality of the noodles.  Also, absolutely no free drink refill."}
{"text":"I've been here a hundred times and it just keeps getting better and better! The ramen is just too delicious. Everything melts in your mouth. Keep it up monta!"}
{"text":"Nice & busy Sunday afternoon. Cute little spot in the Golds Gym parking lot. Ambiance was cozy enough. Service was very good & attentive! The gyoza was my fav! The ramen bowl with the pork & miso broth really hit the spot!! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Forgive me, Yelp, for I have sinned. I am not one of the many dedicated followers from the original Monta who followed them to the Southeast. I am not even a big ramen fan.   Yet with each new ramen house that pops up, I find that I am beginning to change my mind. Okay, Monta is one of the better places in Vegas. It definitely gets bonus points for the broth not being overly salty and the noodles having a nice al dente texture. The karaage is tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. The one item that I would recommend above all else would be the pork belly bowl. The fatty rich meat to rice ratio is perfect.   The best part is that everything is so reasonably priced that you could try a variety and not break the bank."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place to go! I'm always confused as to why every ramen place is so small, which leads to such a long wait. But the ramen is definitely worth the wait.   Customer service is amazing. The server we had was very friendly, funny, and on top of things (water filled constantly, checks on us multiple times, the good stuff). Five stars to him!   I ordered the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with corn (yum yum!). The broth is a bit creamy and I loooove it. I top it with the spicy seasoning and oil (cus I don't wanna pay extra for the spicy paste -- the seasoning and oil is just as good, lemme tell you) and a little bit of that garlic stuff - DELICIOUS! I'm drooling just thinking about it lol.   Get the crispy rice, too. It's like... deep fried rice topped with spicy tuna -- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"What can I say my favorite place to have ramen ...not to mention I come here once a week ...I've tried other ramen but none of them beats monta ...I really love the flavor of the broth ..my favorite is tonkatsu shoyu with thick noodle also have to say the service is here is great especially joe if u haven't tried this place then u should"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Awesome ramen! Good spot for lunch, delicious every time! Try everything with tea and a beer."}
{"text":"Came here a weeks ago for a trip to Vegas and since it was a chilly night ramen sounded perfect. The 2 for $5 Charsiu buns  is what attracted us to this place. They were yummy, I wish there was a little more meat to them but flavors were delish!   I got the Tonkatsu Ramen, the broth was very rich, creamy and savory. I don't like bamboo shoots in my ramen I asked them to emit it, it comes as a standard topping. It was a very simple ramen, it doesn't come with an egg either, it would be $1.50 to add. It's nice that you can add whatever toppings you like but I wish some of them was standard.   My husband got the Tonkatsu Ramen with the black garlic oil, and he enjoyed it very much compared to Jinya version. The flavors were delicious!   For both ramens, it was a little on the salty side, not sure if you can ask to not make it as salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly! If you're in the area, give them a try!"}
{"text":"I would give Monta Chaya's ramen 3 stars originally but I had to knock it down to 2 stars due to a horrible customer service experience.  I've been to Monta Chaya quite a few times throughout the year and the ramen is decent to fill a craving when you're in Henderson. I've tried the Tonkatsu and Tonkatsu-Shoyu ramen. The broth is thicker than I would like but the noodles and hard-boiled egg were decent. The Chashu pork is tender but has a little too much fat unfortunately. I've also tried the Takana Fried Rice but I preferred the regular Fried Rice more! The Takana Fried Rice left me with a strange after taste. The price for the ramen is reasonable, starting at ~$7.   The service time to get the food is a bit slow but for some reason, it always takes a while to pay my check (10-15 minutes) even when actively asking the waitress for the check. The lack of customer service at Asian restaurants doesn't bother me usually but my last visit at Monta Chaya was just ridiculous.    My boyfriend and I were waiting at least 15 minutes for our check that never came and we had to walk up to the front desk to see what was going on. We found out - not through the employees - but from another customer that the waiter accidentally switched our credit cards and charged us for the wrong orders. None of the employees really explained to us what happened. After standing and waiting another 10 minutes for our refund and correct check, we had to ask for the receipt of the refunded charge. We pretty much were left hanging for another 10 minutes, asked for our receipt yet again, only to see that the manager was continuing to work on other table's checks. So he was fine making us wait even longer despite making a charging error and making us wait for so long already! We ended up just giving up and walking out since it was clear they weren't going to help us any time soon.   TLDR: Ramen is average but the bill was charged wrong and ended up having to wait 35 minutes for our check and a receipt that we never got.  The poor customer service we received makes us shudder at the idea of going back and experiencing it again."}
{"text":"This is my top choice for ramen in Henderson. Similar to the Chinatown location, space is limited, so choose your dining time wisely or be prepared to put your name on the list. Our most recent visit was on a Sunday afternoon around 3 PM and was without wait probably because most don't want to have a hot bowl of noodles in triple digit weather, but that doesn't scare us at all.  You can consistently count on a delicious bowl of ramen from this restaurant in the Mon group. The spicy tonkotsu with egg and butter added came out in less than five minutes. The broth was flavorful with the spice level being just right, but I wasn't impressed with the chasu itself as it was sliced thin and had toughened up. My wife had no complaints with her miso. After about 15 minutes after ordering, the gyoza was delivered and was fried with a crisp flat side to add texture, but I had to douse them in soy sauce as the fillings weren't seasoned that well.  Service was friendly and timely with the server repeating our entire order before sending it back to the kitchen. Don't forget about the $1.50 kaedama if you're in a extra noodle mood. For the drinkers, there is a small selection of sake and Japanese beer. If you want to use your credit card to charge the meal, there is a $10 minimum.  I've had both the shoyu and kuro versions which were both delicious and would recommend if those are your preference. I've always stuck with the ramen with every visit, but the cold noodle and any of the bowls are on the agenda for upcoming meals."}
{"text":"Had high expectations from all the great reviews from Yelp.   I know Ramen places tend to be salty (though I've eaten at a few places that weren't), and this was no exception.    If the ramen and the meat was flavorful, I couldn't really tell because the salt content drowned out all the flavor. I had the pork and chicken soup base and my gf had the chicken soup base. Both were equally salty. I even added a bowl of hot water to my soup and it was still salty.. Ugggh!  And the two slices of pork I got in my soup was literally more fat than meat.  And now I'm feeling so thirsty..    Definitely not one of the better places for ramen.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sometimes the first time for anything can go awry...like pulling your first loose tooth, popping an ingrown hair, or your first cavity search.  And I've had a lot of bad ones...but I stopped into Monta Chaya and tried out the kuro ramen because the big old piece of laminated paper said \"brand new on the menu\".  Oooooooh shiny paper!  The kuro ramen came out smelling and tasting amazing!  The garlicky broth and buttery noodles couldn't ruin this virgin kuro eaters experience.  It was so popular, my lady damn near inhaled half of it (I should've ordered two).   But I also recommend ordering the pork belly bowl and crispy rice tuna roll if it's offered.  The pork belly bowl is a staple but the crispy rice tuna seemed like a monthly special.  I remember ordering something similar to the tuna at another restaurant and it was three times the price and not as delicious.  Anywhoo, eating the kuro ramen was a highlight for me in 2013 and totally makes all the cavity searches worth it."}
{"text":"Friend and I needed a new Ramen place. Shoku Ramen Ya was pretty terrible, so we chose the next closest place on Bing - Monta Chaya.  We were blown away by how excellent and flavorful the food was. Menu could be considered small, but it's actually the perfect size. They have great service, but a small staff can result in some delay or confusion during the crazy dinner rushes. Comfy atmosphere, and music is modern, so you are saved from what I call 'lame-ass classical asian stringed instrumental music'.   If you don't want to wait to eat this awesome food,  go before 7:00PM. NOTE: They are CLOSED 2:30 - 5:00 PM to prepare for dinner. Don't be that guy and write a bad review because they're closed when you get there because you're ignant.  We highly recommend the Tonkotsu Shoyu and the Spicy Miso for your entrees/ramen choice. Add in that famous orange spice and you're good to go. Keep in mind that one bowl is a lot of food to tackle before ordering appetizers. 1 appetizer per 2 people is best if you have an average appetite.   Speaking of appetizers- they have a nice selection of flavor-filled appetizers which will enhance your experience. We highly recommend the Gyoza/Pot Stickers and dipping them in your own soy sauce concoction. The Calamari and Pork Belly Bowl are also fantastic choices.   KEEP IN MIND THE FOLLOWING WHEN ORDERING GYOZA: They start frying Gyoza when you order them. 50% of the time, you may receive your Gyoza at the same time or after you get your ramen.  The place is a bit small for the amount of business that Monta Chaya gets, so busy times are a bit chaotic, especially considering they usually only have two servers (no busser) for their 4 four-seater tables, 2 two-seater tables, and a 10 person bar. Doesn't sound like a lot, but the same two people that serve everyone have to buss all those tables and the bar.   I've learned all this from becoming a regular and going here countless times. If you follow my tips to eating here, you will have a wonderful eating experience nearly every visit.  Thanks for being the best, Monta Chaya!"}
{"text":"2nd time here; hoping it had improved based on all the recent positive reviews, but again so terrible; if you like lukewarm salty one note broth with skimpy toppings(which of course cost extra) come here.  With all the great ramen places in LV, don't waste your time here.  As I left, I wanted to tell incoming diners to go somewhere else...it was that bad."}
{"text":"I'm not really a ramen fan but I wanted to try this place since they just opened recently and I heard about them on Yelp Talk so we decided to give them a try. We came around 9:30 PM last night and were greeted immediately by the waitstaff.  The restaurant is small and I think I counted five 4-top tables and there were plenty of counter seatings. They have an open kitchen so if you choose to sit at the counter, then you'll be able to watch the chefs preparing your food.  For our appetizer we decided on the chashu bans which is like a pork belly bao. We both liked it a lot, it was very tasty. We both ordered the Miso Ramen and added extra pork and a hard boiled egg. I liked the ramen but I think next time I will not add the egg. I got full halfway through and believe me, I tried forcing myself to finish the whole bowl but it was just a little too much for me. My boyfriend had no problem finishing his bowl.   The place is very clean and the staff was great but there is one con that i would like to mention and that is the hand soap. I always wash my hands before I eat and I noticed that the hand soap in the restroom had a very strong scent. Whenever I would lift my chopsticks up to my mouth I would smell the strong soap scent still lingering on my hands. I would have liked a nice floral scent instead.  There is not a sign for them yet but they are located right next to Japan Creek in the same shopping center as Golds Gym."}
{"text":"Having just eaten at the Spring Mountain location....I must say Monta Chaya is definitely the newer, sleeker model.  The decor is a little more modern, a whole lot more spacious, and the seats at the bar are more comfortable. Also no seating nazi....I was seated without my whole party being present =).  Of course my first thought is to check the kitchen, there better be a Japanese chef in there!  Okay, this place is legit, the man cooking up the noodles is the right ethnicity.  This location brings back memories of the glory days of Monta in Chinatown.  The pork belly was nice and tender and the broth was not overly salty.  If I still lived on this side of town, I would definitely be a regular.  Also, they have karaage, shishitou, chashu buns, fried calamari, hakusai salad, and daikon salad.  So expanded menu and cleaner....that's always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Decent ramen but not my favorite. The chashu is very inconsistent in quality. The rest is good and it's close to home which makes me a regular."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of ramen but this place was delicious! It's either a hit or miss when it comes to ramen in my opinion. Besides that, this place topped it for me! Everything was perfect! Spicy tonkotsu all day!! I wish they had spicy miso though but it's okay. Customer service was awesome! I didn't catch the guy's name that helped me and my brother but he was very open, funny, and helpful. Which is great because most servers always look so stressed out or plain unhappy. So kudos and much respect to the server to helped us! If you want to eat at a cute little ramen place you should definitely come here!"}
{"text":"So good! I come all the time for the Kuro ramen- yum!! All their apps are also great,  I suggest the Daikon salad!"}
{"text":"This is a cute, small Japanese \"fast food\" Ramen restaurant. The buzzing atmosphere reminded me of my time in Tokyo: the crowd is young and laid back, the food affordable and the servers easy going and fun. A huge drawback are the very limited options for vegetarians. To add insult to injury, there is almost nothing a vegan could order (the salad is probably the only safe option). I totally argue that a restaurant in this day and age (in the western world) should be inclusive and also cater to vegetarians and vegans. Provided they will add a few more vegetarian (or at least fish options) dishes to the menu, I will certainly be back and give it a try again. My friends really enjoyed the food, by the way."}
{"text":"A little bit MSGish but otherwise great tasting, especially the mixture of tonkotsu/shoyu broths.    Been to both locations and the services are always pleasant.  It does get really busy during lunch and dinner time so time it wisely."}
{"text":"Decent grub at a decent price. Always packed and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The Black Garlic Oil Ramen hits the spot on a cold night. I like how the soup isn't that salty and has a good garlic flavor that is not overwhelming. The sliced black fungus provided a great crunch with every bite. Definitely a good bargain at $7.95 for the bowl.  The pork belly rice was on the sweet side. At $5.95 for a large, it has a good amount of pork belly. It was a bit too sweet for me.  The Takata Fried Rice was a bit too salty for me.  I actually mixed the pork belly rice and Takata together and it tasted alright combined.  Even though it was a Tuesday night, there was still a wait out the door. But the line did go pretty fast and we were seated pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Monta Chaya for awhile... I had a huge craving for their Pork Belly Bowl! I'm so glad that I decided to call in for an order of it... Oh how I missed this flavorful bowl of porky goodness!!!! The thinly sliced pieces of pork belly was so tender and melt in your mouth yummy in my tummy awesomeness!!!! I can't express how much I love pork belly!   Monta Chaya also has great ramen! My personal favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen... Sooo good!!! The Calamari is also good... Monta Chaya is my go to Ramen place especially since it's just 10 minutes away from me... Great location! Customer service is also on point... Lurve this place!!!"}
{"text":"I went there because I was in the area at 11:30 a.m. shortly after they opened. The one downside was that it was packed. Other then that, the service was super friendly, and fast. I ordered gyoza and spicy ramen with egg.   The ramen wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but it was still good. The eggs were well seasoned and the pork was cooked excellently. Not overdone.  The gyoza was one if the best I've seen at a restaurant. it was seared but not overly crunchy. I will be going back. A lot."}
{"text":"Good ramen place. All ramen seemed cheap when we looked at the menu to realize any additions cost money - the boiled egg, the seaweed, etc - it ends up being about $10-12 depending on what you add. While this is mot expensive, I just felt it was a little deceiving. However, the broth was delicious and I would be back anytime for some more."}
{"text":"I love the OG Monta.  So you can believe when I learned that there was one closer to my home, I did flips.  A homie told me about the new location, in addition to the new items on the menu.  The new spot was well decorated, a little fancier than its predecessor, and similar to the decor at Shoku Ramen-ya and Fukumimi.  I am still find of the simplistic set up of an authentic ramen shop.  Nevertheless, the decor is not the reason for my visit, I'm here to slurp on some sizoup.  The bowls seem to be be done up a little more as well, a bit more flair than the original, am I wrong?  I was saddened to learn that they don't serve hot water, as strange as it seems.  My trick is to order extra chashu and noodles with a cup of hot water to dilute the saltiness of some of the broth blends.  But the pork belly baos were a nice touch as well as the mini ikura bowls.    The staff looks like the same as Sushimon and Goyemon, after all, they are all owned by the same person.  Staff is always friendly and the chef are always close by and visible.  It's hard to screw up ramen, and this place does it just right.  I still prefer the original, but I can't complain with no lines at the new location.  Close by is Japan Creek, so I assume that there will never be a shortage of chashu I hope.  That is the first place I found where you can buy frozen chashu and hamachi kama.  Always good to burn off some calories by taking a nice walk in the store after a nice meal at Monta Chaya.  Cross advertising baby!!!  Overall, same great quality and service with some slight differences that may be intentional to reach more of a main stream market.  The place is found in an established area of the southeast and strays away from traditional conservative decor from the original, but that is alright with me.    Remember the movie Mr. Baseball starring Magnum PI?  Well you can find me slurpin up a storm like Mr. Baseball if you ever catch me at the spot.  Be easy yall!"}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN I'VE EVER HAD.  Yes, I said it. Coming from SD, LA, and SF...as a new resident to LV, this is my go to spot for my ramen craving! (I also love that I basically love that I live down the street from it!).  Their broth is so flavorful and savory. The noodles have great texture and done just right where other places skimp out on the noodles. Their pork chashu is well done as well.  I also love how you can customize your ramen; I always get extra chashu, nitamago, and sometimes kimchi on the side.   Also, the place doesn't get that crowded as their sister location in the eastside...god that place is ALWAYS crowded it seems.  Also, the servers already know me as a regular! hahahah  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"What else can I say, THIS is the Monta to dine in! More menus, roomier atmosphere, and convienient parking compared to its Spring Mountain location.   The calamari alone is the sole reason to get down here! Everytime I stop by, I ALWAYS order it! So if you happen to be in this area, (in Arnold's voice) GET DOWN HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for Ramen in Henderson.   Pros: Quick and always friendly service. Affordable menu, and everything on the menu is great!!!  Cons: Seating area is small so you will probably have to wait a little, but this is part of the experience.  I have been to this place half a dozen times, and it is consistently amazing. Everything we have tried on the menu is awesome. Just a few highlights are the Mido Ramen with egg, Steamed pork buns, Kim chi and the Pork Belly Bowl. This is one of the only restaurants I know where I want to try everything on the menu. This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite local places!"}
{"text":"Ramen season is in full swing when fall comes around.  If you are in the mood for some noods in Henderson, Monta Chaya has got what you need.  I like to sit at the counter, especially since I've been dining solo on my work lunch break lately.  I show up right when they open at 11:30am so I know I'll get seated immediately, order, and eat in a flash.  My go-to order is the Tonkotsu Shoyu with egg, butter, and corn added.  The service is quick and the soup is comfortingly delicious.  I'll definitely be making lunch plans here often, especially as the weather gets cooler."}
{"text":"Monta Chaya and the original Monta on Spring Mt. are two of my all-time favorite restaurants.  Some days I will wake up craving a big hot bowl of ramen and a bowl full of fried rice.  I usually get the Shoyu Ramen with extra Chashu (pork), the regular friend rice and an order of Gyoza.  The Daikon Salad is also really good.  I never thought I'd be craving radishes, but it's super tasty.  The service is always quick even when they are really busy.  I have recommended this place to many of my friends and relatives and they always want to go back."}
{"text":"We drive across town for this amazing ramen!  The best vegetarian ramen in Las Vegas, tried several others that do not come close to Monta Chaya!  Salmon & Crispy Rice appetizer is a must! BEST VEGETARIAN RAMEN!"}
{"text":"Don't bother me...I'm soaking it all in.  Omg, I love Monta. It's so delicious I felt like singing from atop the nearest mountain.  Except it was 100 degrees in Vegas so I'll just tell it on Yelp.  Hubby and I have both been to the smaller Monta location on Spring Mtn. Rd.  When I noticed this one pop up on Yelp on our way into Vegas, we just HAD TO re-route our GPS to grab lunch here first.  As luck would have it, we arrived about 5 minutes before opening where there were already 3 or 4 parties waiting for the sign the flip.  I enjoyed this location so much more because it was bigger, less cramped and you weren't made to feel like you need to slurp down your (yummy) noodles and get the hell out.    The noodles are just as tasty...the thick sticky broth made me hear angels sing.  My only complaint is that they don't give you very much broth...but I guess we're really just here for the noodles.  As the broth cools, it gets thicker and does a really good job of hanging onto the noodles.  In this respect, I think it's different than the broth at other places.  We also ordered the daikon salad.  This dish elevated the lowly turnip into a crisp, refreshing masterpiece, garnished with these crispy little rice ball bits.  Karaage (fried chicken nuggets) was also very tasty.  I ate mine with a lot of crushed garlic.  Hubby really appreciated me doing so.  Finally, we also ordered my 2nd favorite thing - the takana fried rice.  At this point, I could only manage a few bites but it still hit my lofty expectations.  A few hours later, I enjoyed the leftovers as a wonderful cold snack.  Yum.  As mentioned, service wasn't frenetic and indifferent like the other branch.  These people were allowed the luxury of being friendly and nice at a leisurely pace.  They even checked in on you to see how you were doing.  If you haven't had Monta, come give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! It is small, so on busier nights prepare to wait - we have waited about 45 minutes before, but I personally think it's worth it. It's only slightly larger than their Spring Mountain location, but I think this location normally has a smaller crowd and shorter wait.  Once you're seated, the service has always been very fast, and you get your food very fast as well. It has always consistently been very good food, and I take everyone visiting here. My favorite is the Tonkotsu or the Spicy ramen with a side of gyoza.   Honestly, the only thing I would change about this place is a larger location, since when it's busy you're a little cramped and seated very close to your neighbors. Otherwise - it's perfect!"}
{"text":"This is the only place me and the wife eat ramen at. Great environment, friendly staff and excellent pricing."}
{"text":"I always get the shoyu ramen with extra egg and pork. The food is delicious and the service is fast. Just wish they had a bigger restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a bad thing on the menu. They keep it simple so they can focus on the quality and flavor. It does not suck."}
{"text":"Love love love their Tonkotsu-shoyu ramen with extra chasu and egg. The broth tastes amazing. Also like their fried rice which is unlike other places.  Always busy and be prepared for a 10-15 min wait in peak times."}
{"text":"The less-crowded little sister to Monta on Spring Mountain.  Actually I think I like this one better because there is more seating and you're less likely to die in a fiery car crash in the parking lot like at the other location.  Seriously it's like bumper cars over there.  Dozens of asian female drivers in one place...you know what they say...female driver = no survivors.    Anyhoo, visited this restaurant on Saturday 10/01/2016 at 1:30PM.  $29.90 got us two bowls of ramen, two soft drinks, and an order of fried rice.   I got the shoyu ramen and added an egg and corn.  The chicken-based broth was very good and nicely salty.  The chasu was tender but thin and fatty.  I like to sprinkle Shichimi on mine and make it a little spicy.    Their fried rice is alright...it wasn't very warm and had very little pork.  I prefer the version at Sora because it's served hot and teeming with salty little nibbles of tender porky goodness.    We ordered a side of white rice for my boy but the nice waitress never brought it.  She never came back to check on us so I ended up just sharing with him.  Had to ask them to take it off the bill but it was no biggie.    Overall it was a wonderful lunch and I much prefer it to the Spring Mountain location."}
{"text":"Best ramen i have tried in vegas, service was great and they are very friendly. this is now the place were i bring my relatives and friends who visits us every now and then."}
{"text":"Meh.  Maybe this place is good for Vegas standards, but it taste like crap compared to what I had in Cali.  It was a bit too salty, just as the other reviewers said.  The gyoza, fried rice, and crispy rice were good.  But this a ramen place and it should've been the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"*Thumbs up* The ramen is just as good as the Chinatown location. I've tried them all, but I always come back to the miso ramen with extra chasu. It doesn't skip a beat. The location looks slightly larger and obviously newer, with a bit more elbow room. I like this area of the town and would consider moving here for Monta!  *Thumbs down* Although the fried rice was decent, I would skip their other dishes and strictly save room for the ramen. The calamari was bland and disappointing, which got lost and soggy in the broth. The pork buns were sad and not worth the money. Save your stomatch and money for TWO bowls of ramen!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here Thursday night around 6:40pm. Upon pulling into the parking spot, we spotted a group outside the doors. Hmmm....looks like it could be a long wait. We almost left. But I decided to check it out, and found we were the 2nd party of 2 on the list and opted for counter or table. We were seated within 5 minutes. Way better than the Spring Mountain location where we have had to leave 4 or 5 times due to long waits.  The inside has more seating, probably 10 two tops, and counter space for another 12.   Menu is similar to Monta Ramen. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.95) and as memory serves it was just as delicious. Extra pork chasu (I know my spelling sucks on this but too lazy to check) for an extra $2.50,   Service was good, friendly and quick. Two people working the tables while the crew of 5 in the kitchen area.   So happy to have this option close by. I like Fukumimi as well, and these two have a definitely different broth style, so its nice to have more choice on the east/south side of town."}
{"text":"Can I take this moment to kick myself in the butt for taking SO long to try this place out? I'm currently working in Henderson and often find myself buying food from the In-n-Out located right across the street so HOW DID I MISS THIS PLACE?!  I know there are other ramen places in the Valley which MIGHT be better, but I have never been to those places so this place currently takes it for me! I've always been a fan of ramen. I've never had ramen at a restaurant before unless you count the saimin they serve at Hawaiian places. If I had to picture Japanese ramen - this would be it.  The restaurant is kind of hidden. The sign doesn't stick out too much since the surrounding stores have big signs so keep a look out. The restaurant is pretty small, but I've heard the location in Chinatown is a LOT smaller. The decor consist of wood chairs, stools, and tables. My boyfriend and I went with friends so they guided us on what to order. I got the Miso Ramen with extra pork and butter ~ so delish! I'm craving some right now.  I think we had a new waitress because she mixed up a couple of our plates, but that's not that big of a deal to me. I would rather had the server mix up plates at the correct table than serve our plates to the wrong table. All in all.. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK. I might just start replacing pho as my regular hangover food to ramen, haha."}
{"text":"While the food is great the service is slowwwww! Walked in and a table opened up but did we get seated right away?? NO! We waited for at least 10 mins and neither of the girls acknowledged us! So I am trying to be all zen now a days and I just stand there looking at them. Finally we get our seat but once again there's a lot of waiting! It amazes that the one on Spring Mt. is so busy but moves so quickly...while this place was empty and moves so slowly. I might give this place another try, but if it's as slow as the last time I will be avoiding it."}
{"text":"Doing the take out thing today. Hopefully it will be just as good. Not the same as eating in, hope it is delicious when I take it home.  I am sure it will be."}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday night around 7pm and I was shocked to see how crowded the place was! Luckily there were still a few open tables, so my group of 7 was quickly accommodated. Since this was my first time here, I obviously needed to try their ramen, but I also read so many good things about the pork belly bowl. This left me in quite a predicament. Ramen or pork belly bowl? The answer was both!   After telling everyone about all the good things I had read about the pork belly, someone in my group finally offered to share a small one with me (thanks Courtney K!). So glad I got this because it was delicious! The meat was so flavorful and the ginger on top was the perfect touch!  As for the ramen, I got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. The broth was rich and savory, and I was glad it wasn't overly salty. I really liked the chasu pork in the ramen- it practically melted in my mouth!  And oh my noodles! They certainly don't skimp on the noodles, so I was quite full by the end of my meal. Definitely $10 well spent!"}
{"text":"Very small location expect wait times of 30 minutes to be seated.   The Ramen is delicious, services quick.  Parking is a nightmare"}
{"text":"I just wanna live in it.   Idk how credible my review will be since I've only had ramen about 3 times in my life and all 3 times were at Monta.   The first time was with a group of friends and it was amazing.   The second time was the Japanese fest a month or 2 ago and third was today.   All 3 times I've loved it but the more I have it the more I notice the grease.   The second time I had it, I brought some home and stuck it in the fridge. Next morning it was solid. So much grease it turned to freaking Tonkatsu jello. You could slice into it.   Again tonight. I'm eating left overs and my lips are so glossy and greasy.   Idk if this is normal, like I said I've only had it 3 times and all 3 times it was Monta.   We tried the pork fried rice, pork belly bowl and gyoza and all of it was super tasty and amazing.   I'll keep coming back to clog my arteries 1 delicious bowl at a time.   Great price, enormous size, tons of add ins and nice staff.   I love Monta."}
{"text":"I love the ramen and the bun here. I'm not sure if Monta is a chain, but there are 2 more places in Spring Mountain. Anyway, this place is closest to my place, so my wife and I come here quite often. My regular dish is the fried rice and regular ramen... both are awesome dishes. They just barely have the new dish, I can't remember the name, but it's port-bun, really good. You guys should try."}
{"text":"Overall, this restaurant is great. I frequent monta about 5 times a month. During my visits, I have only waited a long time twice (30 min). The waiters are nice and were quick to seat me. There's a male waiter that is very friendly and always makes us laugh when we converse. The food is affordable especially for the amount, taste and presentation that comes with it. While everything sounds great, on two occasions I have found some \"non-edibles\" in my food. They were very apologetic though and quickly fixed the problem by offering a refund and extra dish. I will be returning soon despite those minor things because this restaurants food is addicting. Just keep in mind that the restaurant is very small though and not a good place to host groups."}
{"text":"I was about to write a review of Monta Chaya, but thinking about it makes me want Monta noodles. Now. So instead, I'm heading over there right now to get my fix. This is as good as the Spring Mountain location."}
{"text":"From the simple menu to the excellent service, this place deserves the high rating. The Tonkatsu ramen I ordered was amazing. The chashu is cooked tender and perfect, the broth is well seasoned and the extra chashu and egg I ordered made my meal well balanced and extremely enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The service is always good. The food is always good and consistent. I normally have to drive to china town for ramen until I found out about this location. It's perfect for all the ramen lovers on this side of town. It's a small and quaint place. It always seems to be busy. I can see why!! I've never had a bad experience here and I don't think I ever will."}
{"text":"If you can tell from my previous reviews, I prefer not having to drive very far for delectable eats.  This place sits in a plaza that's nearby the local shopping centers and has ample parking. I ordered the Miso with nori and egg. It was a bit on the salty side, but delicious still. I was looking for a spicy miso option, but none was available. :(  I also ordered the cha shu bun and that was delicious since it was like a slider with the lettuce and sauce.   Great service and everyone was always smiling."}
{"text":"Best. Ramen. In. Town.  Everyone has their own opinion on ramen, but for me, Monta hits the spot. The first time I ever had ramen was at the one on Spring Mountain. And I was soooo happy they opened one on eastern which is closer to my house! Both places always never let me down. The staff is courteous and never miss a hello or goodbye. Though wait times can be ridiculous, it just shows you how good of a place they really are. The gyoza is really delicious. The dumpling meat is cooked and tastes good with the sauce they give you. Today we tried the steamed buns and it was TO DIE FOR. The sauce that was marinated on the pork was a hint of spicy and I don't know what it was but it was soooo good. I wanna put it on all my meat! Lol. It only comes with two, but I split it with four people. We each didn't want our portions to end. I could probably eat two of them and be full. We also tried the calamari which was crispy and marinated in a sauce so you didn't need to dip it into anything. Not amazing but not bad either. As for the ramen, I usually get tonkatsu shoyu. Their broth is tasty and the pork is cooked perfectly. I actually like eating the fattier parts, which is very yummy. I like to add egg, butter, and corn, but you can have it anyway you like. The little spice stuff they have on the table is a good little kick to add! And you can control how spicy you want the broth. I like to add sesame seeds for texture. The noodles are cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too hard. I don't like mushrooms so I ask for none and they're always very accommodating. The food comes out hot and pretty fast as well. They play newest music and sometimes they even play old hit songs which is a lot of fun cause it makes the atmosphere really fun. I love monta and will always recommend it for ramen!"}
{"text":"Awesome place still. I go here at least once a week with my partner. Seriously, where else could you get delicious ramen starting at $6.95?  My go-to order is Kuro Ramen with thick wavy noodles and flavored egg. It's about $10.22 with tax. Slightly more expensive, but it's so damn good. I don't even look at the menu anymore because this is hands-down the best ramen they serve here. Super fatty and filling. If you're extra hungry, you can also add extra noodles too.  Service here can be spotty at times, but you can tell the kitchen staff is working non-stop. I've only seen service quality drop when the restaurant was super crowded. You can't blame them for that.   Overall, this place will always be my favorite ramen place in Henderson/Las Vegas. It's constantly packed during dinner hours, so you know it's a local favorite. If you don't like lines, try showing up when they first open or during the late lunch hours. They're typically slow when they first open too."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place multiple times every time I'm in the area... Our family favorite Ramen place here in Las Vegas. Service & Food quality! Great combo!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it's always good, friendly and clean. The broth is very tasty and portions are big :) If you're up for some ramen and can't drive across town this place is perfect. Only problem I see is that the place is only good for small groups, I'd stay under 4 people."}
{"text":"I went to the one on Eastern in Henderson in the Gold's Gym shopping plaza.  My friend took me there and she had the Summer Ramen Dish Special which was corn, tomato sauce and was really tasty. I had the cool noodles which was zesty and light for a lunch meal.  It came with the Yuzi lemony sauce. It was good eats! This was back in 2012 or 2013."}
{"text":"Favorite ramen spot in Vegas ! The food is beautiful and flavorful. Change nothing monta you guys are amazing !"}
{"text":"I almost always get the Black Garlic Oil Tonkatsu Ramen. I eat it up and then always order the extra noodles for $1.50 to go and box up my leftover broth.   Then I add some corn, butter, nori sheets, and 2 soft boiled eggs for breakfast. These are things I usually have in the house. AMAZING. The noodles suffer a little being reheated but the taste is still divine.  Nice way to extend the magic.  There may be better ramen houses in LA, in SF, New York, or from memories of Japan. Really? Live in the now. Get over it. It's still good.  It's often part of a much larger routine where I go up the street to http://www.yelp.com/biz/henderson-china-foot-massage-and-reflexology-las-vegas and get an hour long reflexology foot massage. It's actually more of a full body massage than just your feet. Don't go if you don't want to take off your top. I can see in some of the reviews that people freak out over that. It's a massage. America needs to stop being so puritanical & squeamish. It's also hardcore deep tissue and they beat you up. You're sore afterwards in a good way like being sore after a gym workout.  This is why we eat ramen afterwards, to ascend into heaven and soothe the pain."}
{"text":"An impromptu date night landed us at Monta Chaya and we definitely left satisfied. The service was superb. The atmosphere and setting was just as great. Most importantly the food was awesome. I had the daikon salad and kimchee fried rice, both were delicious. I would give five stars had it not been for the basic menu and lack of fresh, hot green tea. Green tea from a can that has been heated and brought to my table along with a plastic cup just didn't cut it for me. We will definitely be back though. I'll just drink water. :)"}
