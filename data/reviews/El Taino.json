{"text":"LOVED this place.  we had been talking about going there, but the first attempt proved unfruitful, since they were closed.  but last night we actually got to go.  awesomeness in a little place.  authentic, delicious puerto rican food.  huuuuge portions.  i had the empanadillas pollo, yellow rice, and we both got the canoa.   aaaand we got a spanish lesson, too. seriously- the most fun i've had dining in a long time.  the woman at the counter was so nice, so helpful, and so sweet.  and teaching us spanish as we order (because we asked, not because she was forcing it on us) was pretty freakin' sweet.  Am taino. Yo amara devolver varias veces. sin embargo, yo no debera comer all demasiado, porque mi extremo ser el tamao de Texas..  yep."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in at least ten years. They have had a reputation for not serving the freshest food after one in the afternoon, so I have been getting my rice and beans fix else where. My BFF's mom and step dad met us here for lunch on Saturday (its the only Spanish restaurant in the city where the food is prepared by puerto ricans, only place her step dad will eat at) so we bit our tongue and seated ourselves.   It was around noon, all the food was really fresh and piping hot. I did the white rice, beans and chicken stew. The white rice was blander than expected and the beans really helped add a nice flavor element, so I dumped them over the rice. I have never ordered the chicken stew, I usually order the beef stew, but since I'm watching my figure and the chicken stew looked so good, I gave it a shot. Big mistake, the stew was riddeled with bones, big ones, little ones, baby ones, every kind of bone imaginable. It's true, by cooking the stew with the bones in (they clearly put the WHOLE bird in) it adds a ton of natural flavor. I just had no idea upon ordering what I had got myself into. Every bite I heard and felt the crunching. You couldn't see the bones, so I just didn't eat my food. Thank god my bill was only $9 for the meal and my bottled water or I would have been pissed.  The other food items were good, I tried a bite of everyone's food (they offered since the knew I'd be writing a review). The pernil (pig roast, shredded) was different, not as salty as everyone else's that I have had, but good. The banana was really good with garlic oil on it. The potato ball was fine, little too light on the meat.   With all the other options in the area, I can't say I was happy, impressed or that I will ever return."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. It was the worst Puerto Rican food I have ever had. The chicharon tasted like salty old bricks. The arroz con gandules was crunchy old and nasty. The bacalaito had to have been sitting under that heat lamp for days because you couldn't even bite through it without breaking a tooth. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall if ever there was one.  The food is laid out cafeteria style and there's a warming case containing the whole fried fish (bones and all) chicken and beef empanadillos,potato balls and some other items.  Also, part of my meal was warmed up in the microwave.  All that aside the two ladies working the counter were sweet (even with the language barrier) and I wish this place was open at 2 in the morning.  Perfect drunk food. I had the beef and what was supposed to be beef and cheese empanadillas.  The beef one had a nice spice and contained potatoes with an almost pie like crust.  Pretty good.  The cheese one contained, well, only American cheese.  Pretty disappointing.  But the crust is addicting so I ate the crispy part around the outside.   I also had the mofongo.  I had it plain simply because it was 4.50 plain or 11 bucks to add the sauce.  Since I have no other comparison, I'm going to say it was the best mofongo I have ever had.  A bit dry but that's my cheap ass' fault.  Had hints of garlic and crispy bits where the fried meat was cut up.  The plantains were dense.  I liked it.  Again, if it was two in the morning it would have probably been delicious."}
