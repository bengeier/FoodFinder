{"text":"Decent cappuccino, though nothing to write home about. As a quick and simple breakfast, the baguette with havarti and apricot jam is a generous size and reasonably priced. Though the bread was a tad on the tough side for my taste. I do like the decor and the bar style seating. Bonus points for free wi-fi and friendly service. I'll be interested to try other items on the menus - both food and beverage. Always good to have another coffee option in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I am shocked to be only the 2nd person reviewing this amazing space. With many of most recent loft tours starting and ending here, its the ideal meeting spot in Queen West. A stone's throw from my ViPs at the Candy Factory Lofts will make this a regular stop for me. The food and drink is amazing."}
{"text":"I go here on Saturday mornings for an Americano or tea and a croissant. The croissants are always warm when I get there and so so yummy! Love the food and drinks that are offered, but the staff hasn't been all that friendly - which is surprising since all the other reviews say they are great? Maybe the B team is there on Sat. mornings. They barely say two words to me, don't say thank you or even smile. Kind of a turn off... I keep going back for coffee and a treat though!"}
{"text":"I went here to grab a morning beverage, after walking by its cute exterior a few times. the exterior is more interesting than the interior..me thinks. Not that the interior isn't bad, but its small, and it feels..a bit sterile. Like a really, really clean ice cream store (I have no idea where that descriptive came from but hopefully you get a sense).

Ok, so I ordered a basic coffee, which was reasonably priced just under $2. However, I would say the serving size of a small is around ~10 ounces. I find in other independant coffeee shops, their small is closer to 12-14ounces. The coffee was strong, if you like starbucks, you will like this coffee. I personally I prefer more flavourful/milder blends. 

The food options were a little on the higher side, and nothing in particular stood out at me. They do have cookies, sandwiches, that kind of thing.

The service was friendly. I should mention when I went in there around 930am, the place was empty.

I suggest heading ~10 shops west on Queen to T.A.N. More cozy atmosphere and better selection of drink/food options."}
{"text":"Cozy, bright space, slick digital display, wonderful coffee & tea and most amazing sandwiches you will ever have! Add free wi-fi, nice lounge music and super friendly stuff and you have a fantastic work & hangout place, free-agent style. Need a quite room to run a meeting? They got that too. Who said work isn't fun? It is fun and it tastes delicious when you do it at Cloud Espresso Bar."}
{"text":"I went here (not on the Indy Coffee Passport Card) for the co-working environment. Supposed to be a part time agency. Pretty cramped. Not a good place for working. Didn't grab a cup in the end. There were no tables. Went to T.A.N instead. Staff were friendly, good addition to the hood. But not the place for sitting down with a laptop and getting work done."}
{"text":"Meh.

Came here for coffee on a weekday afternoon with my hubby and 10m old son.  Felt like a very \"Hipster\" type of place- definitely not a place where many babies frequent, I'm sure.  I got this vibe from the weird look the coffee maker guy gave me.  \"What is that she's holding?  A bay...be?\"  You've never seen a kid before or what?

I ordered a vanilla chai latte with soy and to be honest, it didn't taste much different from Starbucks.  I didn't order any food although the cookies looked freshly baked.

Extra star for using Fair Trade coffee!"}
{"text":"By far, my favourite place for a cappuccino on Queen. While I haven't tried anything else, the caps have been consistently good (Smooth, creamy, aromatic) and their sammiches look yummy! 

I found the caps at T.A.N too milky, and the espresso at White Squirrel and Second Cup were burnt from being held in the machine too long. (Boo Hiss)

The atmosphere is pretty decent in terms of getting work done. I'm usually around in the mornings and afternoons on a weekday, and there is plenty of seating an electrical outlets. It's bright, clean and airy :)"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of Cloud Free Agent, the music is always spot-on, the white walls, the windows, the people that work there are nice as hell, but the latte is so disappointing I have to retract a star. Go to Cloud for the baked goods and Americanos, go to T.A.N. for the lattes."}
{"text":"Popped in here early on a weekday morning. It's a fairly monochrome spot, loaded with stools and a Queen Street facing counter. As the only one there, I was able to score the caf√©'s sole booth, an L-shaped deal with room for four (maybe even five). The booth was also close to an outlet which was a plus.

This coffee and tea joint has standard fare like baked goods and sandwiches for lunch. They also sell Fairy Tonic Kombucha, which is a decent alternative when drinking coffee all the live long day.

It is fortunate that I love The Strokes because they played \"Is This It\" no less than four times as I sat their working. I handled this without complaining, but I could see how this would get annoying, esp. in a place pitched as a collaborative work mecca. While it seems like an OK place to get some work done, it could definitely use more outlets and actual tables before I would consider this an office away from home. Still, I would return as long as I can get that booth!

Obligatory Title Pun: Send in... the CLOUDS.

Menu Readability: LCDs list everything on the menu. Neat-o.

Need to mention: There is a Collaboration Space downstairs which you rent by the hour for conferences, Settlers of Catan tournaments and whatnot.

What this place teaches me about myself: I really do dig the The Strokes."}
{"text":"Where to begin! This place has been open three weeks, is part ad agency, part cafe, serves all day brunch, is sleek and cozy, and has the nicest cafe staff I have encountered in the entire city. And it is delicious.

I swung by just to try a coffee but I wound up staying for several hours, hanging out with the guy who runs the place and talking to other patrons, even after the cafe closed.

The place itself is a bit on the small size upstairs but I think there is a larger part downstairs for that aforementioned ad agency. It's all white with splashes of colour here and there, displays its menu on a screen (so cool!), and has a variety of sandwiches, baguettes (you can buy them to give and if you buy five, you get the sixth free), and pastries. And the selection of coffee beverages is pretty great.

The man in charge of the cafe (not the agency) used to run Bonjour Brioche, so you know what he's capable of - nothing less than amazing. The cafe isn't in my neighbourhood but any time I find myself around Queen and Shaw, I will stop in grab something to eat, or at least say hello - all three people working at the cafe struck up conversations with me and won me over.

I swear I have no connection to this cafe other than I had a brilliant first experience. I will happily do PR for them in exchange for fresh croissants and vanilla lattes. Go, go, go to Cloud Cafe!"}
