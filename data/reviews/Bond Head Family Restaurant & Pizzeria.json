{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday night. A couple guys shared a pizza...it looked good.  My fiancee had the pork souvlaki dinner. It came with fries, a Greek salad and garlic bread. Fries were good, just typical frozen stuff. The salad had olives, onion, tomato, cucumber and feta on iceberg lettuce with olive oil dressing. Garlic bread was half a bun and dryyyy. The pork was also dry and tasteless.  I had halibut and chips. Fries were ok...fish was meh, could have been bigger. Came with a side salad consisting of iceberg, tomato and some catalina dressing.   The place could use some cleaning up and restoration. It might be better in the morning for breakfast....I won't be back though.  The owner was not very friendly but chatted with us a bit when leaving."}
{"text":"Nice little 'mom & pop' family restaurant. Lots of variety on the menu, from pizza to souvlaki (the owners are Greek) and sandwiches to steak. I recommend the pizza. Very clean inside with cafeteria style seating."}
{"text":"Well...in the beginning when they first opened, their pizza was great! But after being open for only a couple of months, they see to have begun resting on their laurels. Stopped there for 2 large pizzas last Friday (Nov. 24/17) and while it may be my fault for not checking my order before leaving, the fact remains that i did not receive the extra pepperoni & extra cheese i paid for on one of the pizzas, while the other pizza had an incorrect topping on it. The worst part is, i called once i arrived home to bring this issue to their attention (20 mins after leaving the store). After a few rings, it went to voicemail, to which i left a clear & detailed message. Yet 4 days later, i have yet to hear back from the store. Not the first time they made a mistake, but definitely the last time i'm a patron to their store."}
