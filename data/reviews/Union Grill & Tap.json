{"text":"Very cool vib going on.   Lots of flat screens and good sports bar feeling.  I liked it.  I ordered the union burger.   It was grilled perfectly and drinks are great also.   House fries where very good."}
{"text":"Server doesn't know the menu. Ticket time is at 20 mins and still waiting. All drinks are empty. Currently dead.? My motto is always try something twice. Not sure I will give this a second try. Disappointed as I am a huge hub fan but not here."}
{"text":"Just not s good second experience. Bartender more interested in socializing with friends than taken care of guests. Looking forward when the new place takes over.  Stay away if you looking for a nice cold beer.... not sure if you'll get it."}
{"text":"Great new place, completely remodeled from the previous establishment that was there. Very open modern look with garage doors to new patio and best of all an outside bar. Tons of local craft beer choices and wines. Very diverse menu with a good variety of apps. Got to try the fried chicken, yup the fried chicken. Staff was very friendly and service was on point."}
{"text":"Food Amazing!!  We have gone now twice and I must tell you I dream about my next visit!  Everything is seasoned so well and the menu has such fun choices and options!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have been satisfied each time. They carry a good selection of local beers on tap along with a creative menu that even features vegetarian options. Attention to detail was noticed on how menus were place on tables and silverware. Have both inside and outside dinning"}
{"text":"Stopped in after I found this place while my husband was driving us towards the wilderness brewing co. SO glad we did. Great food, refreshing cold beer and great service. Wish I was better with names cause our server was awesome (tatted guy with a short beard). Definately going back and telling our friends about it!  (The spicy jalapeño burger and I think they were called house fries- sorta like steak fries but a little thinner - with Sonoran white chocolate Hefeweizen YUMMMMM)"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for lunch...Yum! Ordered the nachos and the cheese sauce is amazing. Service impeccable. I will definitely be back. The managers are very nice and they went out of their way to make sure we were happy. The menu is loaded with great choices."}
{"text":"So first thing is first, my wife and I are huge Hub fans and have been going there for years now. With that being said I was pretty excited to know that they had a new place coming and it would be as local as possible I was excited. The Union exceeded our expectations especially it being during their \"soft opening\" aka they haven't gotten everything down and they are trying what they have come up with. I saw the 1 star review on here and just laughed and so should everyone else.   My wife got the BBQ pork sandwich which was great. The fries were delicious. Her drink was the strawberry smash which was refreshing and great.  I got the seafood ciopinno and it was phenomenal. It was so perfectly cooked which surprised me since I was at a bar. I had the Historic Piehole Porter which is delicious.   Our server Kylie was amazing!!! She really cared about us and treated us like family and so sweet. She even talked to our son and watched Trolls a little with him. Ask for Kylie because we will!    Side note- we noticed the table next to us had an \"issue\" and the manager Dustin came over and handled it perfectly. Also, since it was there soft open, Kylie kept asking what we thought and if there was thing that they could improve. It shows they really care what we think.   Needless to say we will be back to try more delicious food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service!  My whole family enjoyed their meals too.  They are great with kids...they got to pick from the treasure box.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and location! However, I did think the prices were too high. The artichoke dip is awesome, and I loved the grilled cheese and soup. Husband ordered the fish and chips and although it looked crispy, the outside wasn't at all, so that was a bummer. Overall it's a great atmosphere and cool concept! Definitely recommend going during happy hour."}
{"text":"Finally, a place for drinks and grub nearby that is worth going to!  It took so long to remodel and get open, but if today was any indication, it was worth it. The staff was terrific - attentive, helpful, friendly. The beer selection excellent - the Goldwater ale made in Scottsdale was terrific! Food excellent - the bacon cheeseburger flavorful and well made. We sat outside, the misters made it comfortable. This location has been through a lot. What is this, the third or fourth grill pub in the place? I hope they succeed. This area of town needs something like it and hopefully they can attract a loyal clientele. There are two hotels nearby and a third on the way. Already have plans for next Friday. BTW - the late night happy hour is a great idea.  Goodluck!"}
{"text":"Went here on opening night! Food was good. I had the spicy jalapeño burger. However I noticed the manager yelling at his staff, throwing things towards his cooks in the back, and for the lack of better terms just being an ass to his employees  for being so new. It's unprofessional to treat your employees so badly, especially in plain sight of your customers. It was unsettling to watch and as he approached my table to ask how my night was going, I genuinely refused to talk to him. Will not be returning somewhere if the manager can't treat his employees right!"}
{"text":"My husband myself and our friends went on a Sunday. I enjoyed the halibut tacos my hubby had the shrimp and grits. My girlfriend had a ham and cheese sammie with Mac and cheese and her husband had a burger. We completely enjoyed our meals!  Spot on!! We partook in some adult beverages having beers and ciders. After we enjoyed talking and laughing in a relaxing atmosphere we decided to have dessert. The cookie dough rolls with ice cream. Perfect ending to a delicious meal. Let me also say that 95% of the menus is scratch made; along with being locally grown or produced in AZ. Want to give a shout out to our server Alex she had great suggestion on the menus items. Along with her knowledge of the menus she has a wonderful sense of humor. She kept up with our fun banter and kept us laughing.  Thank you everyone for providing a great meal, pouring our drinks and letting us relax and feel at home. CHEERS"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.... And 9 times out of 10, I would, however...   As we are pulling up, there are 2 servers out back smoking, while another  server is rolling silverware. :( So, not only can dust and debris get on the clear silverware, they are being rolled right next to someone smoking.   Our waiter, no clue what his name was b/c he wasn't wearing a name tag,  was awesome.. super nice, knew the menu, recommended a variety of items.. If I only knew his name.   We ordered an appetizer, Pork Belly Poutine.   I was REALLY excited for this as I'm from the south, and no one here makes/serves cracklin's the correct way.. They came out and looked delicious.  I immediately went for a cracklin and was disappointed. :(  They were cold, like from the fridge cold.  I asked the server if they were supposed to be cold, and he wasn't sure.  Besides them being cold and \"chewy\" the dish wasn't bad..   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, medium with no bun.. What I got was a burnt burger on a limp piece of lettuce?  Burnt.. Like crispy on the outside, No Pink in the middle and burnt on the outside.. The cheese on top wasn't even melted.  Then I asked for a side of ranch to \"Help\" the burger.. and was charge $0.60 for a TINY half filled thing of ranch. REALLY?  I didn't even eat half of it.. Not one time did the waiter ask me if the burger was okay. He asked if I wanted a to go box? For what.. to play hockey?   We also ordered the fried Chicken.. Now this dish.... This is what saved the entire visit.. Probably one of the BEST fried chicken we've ever had.  And it comes with a smoked agave side.  Amazing.. The chicken is super juicy and the breading (which is a little much on some pieces) was perfect.  Comes with potatoes and a side of veggies.. I would absolutely return to The Union just for this dish alone.    We did have another server come and offer us samples of beer, which was nice.. and we found a couple other beers we would try thanks to him.  I think this place is going to be amazing if they could get those few minor items under control. First drop the $0.60 for ranch, unless it's a ton they are requesting... And put a halt to the rolling silverware outside next to a road where cars are driving by, with other servers smoking.   We plan on going back in a week or so to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and good. We had the Gnocchi and a modified Union Board for vegetarians. Their menu appears to offer many made from scratch items."}
{"text":"The waiter Seth was super slow.   So slow that he only offered to refill my drink as I was paying my tab. A little too late if you ask your customer if they want a refill to go.   Food was good but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Was honored to be welcomed into union for their friends and family night/soft opening, and i was very impressed!! Food was great, the spinach dip was my favorite (I'd go back just for that). Even when the kitchen was backed up service never lacked, made sure to communicate with us and check in. Overall I'm very excited to have an atmosphere and quality food like Union to be able to enjoy!"}
{"text":"So nice to have a gastro pub so close to my home. Our 1st visit was last Sunday, Mother's Day. To my surprise they were not super busy, since it was early. Staff greeted & seated us right away. Our server was fantastic, wished me a happy one & gave me a rose. So sweet. Appetizers were delish!! Had bruschetta & fries poutine. My hubs ordered mac & cheese with chicken, I had shrimp & grits. Grits were a bit lumpy, hence 4 stars. We shared bread pudding for dessert, not too sweet which makes for a great ending to a meal in my books. Place is beautiful, everyone was so attentive. Definitely will be back, since I'm planning to eat my way to entire menu."}
{"text":"Great high end sports bar/ restaurant for everyone!  Tons of local beers and wines plus the staple domestics.  The food is great and isn't your typical fried food only bar.  Definitely the best and nicest in the area.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place five stars in a revised review some day! It's close, great concept, and related to the HUB so we were really excited to try it for brunch. Clearly, they are new and have some things to work out. We were hoping for amazing bloody Mary's, but they were a little thick and weak, so we ordered an extra shot... $30 for two bloodies was not out intention, but live and learn. I got the bacon burger, no bun, side salad. What I received was a bacon burger no bun, only lettuce. Asked for the tomato, onion, pickle... out came a caesar salad, I asked for garden... out came a garden salad with the wrong dressing. Yikes! When we got the bill, I was charged for the side salad and the dressing. Asked the server about it and he \"talked to the manager\" and got it taken off... oh, thanks! The burger menu says, your choice of side.  We'll wait a while and hopefully it will be better next time!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere with great food and service. A nice spin on traditional pub foods. All  made from scratch and did I mention a great selection of drink? I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Our server, Chad, was as courteous as he was helpful. The only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars was the salad choices, or rather, the lack of. Great atmosphere, 26 beers on tap, super friendly staff, and awesome indoor and outdoor seating. The beef spring roll appetizer is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I should of brought this up at the restaurant but I ordered the fish and chips on Saturday night and it had ZERO taste, even the flat mushy French fries were tasteless. The water had more taste. My friend's taco shrimp seemed fine... I'm not sure I'll return... good thing it has hotel and hospital business close by."}
{"text":"So happy to have have found Union Grill & Tap! Having been disappointed with the closest bar & grill to our home, Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers (mainly disappointed with high price and warm beer temp) we searched Yelp to find something new to try.   Happy to report our first visit to UG&T was a huge success. We were sat quickly, our waitress Kylie was very attentive- despite juggling a number of tables. The food was great, the beer selection solid and the beer was nice an cold. Best part is, the price is very reasonable.   The only negative was the menu was a little limited. Not a huge selection, but I'm guessing they focus on a smaller selection and really give each dish some extra attention. The burger & Cubano we had were excellent.  Also, try the fries! Thin and crispy steak fries...have never seen fries prepared this   Looking forward to our next trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and to catch the DBacks game. Very impressed with the service, everyone was friendly and helpful. Our server Lenin was really special. Friendly, helpful and really made me feel welcome.  The draft beer list was good, all AZ beers, not overwhelming with 4 peaks or San tan. All of AZ was represented.  We ordered the hummus plate, above average and the pork wings because it sounded weird. Both were worth going back for."}
{"text":"Ok, this was an amazing find. And the find came as a flyer in the mail. Whom ever thought of that idea, should get a raise. I will go through our order and service   Service was great!! Attentive and fast! The manager even stopped by and talked to use about the food.   Fish and Chips - I am a fish and chips guy. Must be my English roots. This was some of the best I've had. It's fresh caught halibut and taste amazing. The house fries are delicious and cooked Pearce. Coleslaw was perfect. Portions were very filling.   Turkey Club - my daughter ordered this one. The portion was more than she could handle. Her words; best club she's ever had.   Cubano - was amazing. The dejon has a bit of a kick, but with the sweet glaze, it's the perfect balance. The meat was tender and it was very easy to over eat. Get the root chips. They are addicting.   Baja Shrimp Tacos - Like everything else, amazing. Three, loaded tacos with perfect cilantro crema sauce. They were amazing and the smile from my youngest was priceless.   Children's chicken tenders - \"best chicken tenders ever\" says the 7 year old. Large portions that he wasn't able to finish.   This coupled with a extensive local beer list is definitely is a must stop eatery. They pride them selves on local brewery's and local foods. We will be going back. This new restaurant is a true gem."}
{"text":"Had the nachos shareable and it was so good! Awesome assortment of Arizona beer. You can do a flight of 5 for $5 bucks on Sunday for the all day happy hour. (Shareables were $2 off all day Sunday too.) We went during midday on a sunday so not busy at all. Lots of tv's. Lots of seating. Outsude seating as well with misters. Definitely a \"dude-bro\"place to go lol."}
{"text":"I really would love to see this place do well. My husband and I checked Union Grill & Tap out after seeing it featured on an Instagram account I follow. The decor is trendy and updated.  The dining room is spacious and ready to fill up on fight or game nights.  I didn't try any beer or wine tonight but their drink menu is local and interesting.    For an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta. It was piled high and very flavorful. I love how much they try to pack on that piece of bread. As long as you don't mind your bruschetta a little messy it is perfect. The brie and fig elevate the flavors and make it a touch above your typical bruschetta.   I got the Union Loaf.  This is a vegetarian version of meatloaf served with a side of mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.  I have to say it was absolutely delicious I am a meat lover and I didn't miss the meat at all.  Great texture, very flavorful.  I wasn't crazy about the gravy but it was still good, just not great.  The veggies were seasoned well and not over cooked.   My husband got the fish and chips. He liked the buttermilk crust and the fish was well cooked, moist, and flaky.  It didn't feel overly fried or greasy.   Since they only opened yesterday I was kind of expecting service to be spotty and issues in the kitchen to be apparent. NOT SO. our waitress Leslie was amazing and prompt. She regularly surveyed us for our opinion and was generally interested in any constructive criticism. Our food came quickly and at the appropriate temperature.    We are excited to return!"}
{"text":"Service outstanding - great decor - terrific menu. We had the Union Loaf - a vegetarian meatloaf with the Impossible Burger and Beyond Beef mixture. Love the local approach. We'll be back for sure. Thank you."}
{"text":"Service was very good and it doesn't have a nice atmosphere, those are my only positive comments.  We had the bread board, southwest chicken salad, and fish tacos.  Everything was bland.  The salad said it had peppercorn ranch- I have had regular ranch dressing with more flavor. The chicken was in big hunks off the grill with no seasoning, just a very boring salad.  The bread board seemed good at first, but as soon as it cooled off the bread turned rock hard.  The 4 dips- nothing to remember- mascarpone was runny and flavorless (claims to have lemon in it)- the mustard dip had a funny taste, and the cheese dip was ok, but cooled very quickly, and the 4th dip was tomato or red pepper or something- ehh, again nothing to remember and not sure why you would that on bread.  Menu doesn't even list this as one of the dips (looking at menu later, it shows this dip coming with a different menu item)- it lists shallot butter which we didn't get. There was raisin pecan bread- and since there was nothing to dip it in- I asked for butter, so the waitress (who again was very good) brought herb butter (with green herbs, so no, not the one we were supposed to get- the shallot one), thinking she was being kind, but again I don't want a savory butter on my 'sweet' type of bread (that may just be a personal thing).  The first tacos were very large, but again the person eating them in our group reported they were very bland.  They also has lots of flies in there- but this was more due to rude customers standing and holding front door open- not sure why given it was 105 degrees in the middle of the afternoon- however, the staff did nothing to stop this woman, so we had to keep shooing flies away."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. I also like that most of the menu and drinks are local ingredients. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that my husband is a picky eater and the menu didn't have much for him."}
{"text":"This is a new to Gilbert area bar and grill it's a nice place I highly recommend it. We got here a little late to order food but it looks good."}
{"text":"As big fans of The Hub, we had high hopes for this place and were excited to try it. We had the Mushroom Burger, the Fish and Chips, and the Fried Chicken platter. First off, it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive, despite the restaurant being half-empty on a Friday night. No one acknowledged any delay to us or apologized for the wait. We had no refills on drinks during this time, either.  When the food did arrive, it was unappetizing. The chicken and fish were genuinely inedible. We sent most of each plate back untouched. The fish batter was so salty that it hurt my mouth to eat, and per a previous reviewer's description, the sides had no flavor. The mascarpone tartar had no discernible mascarpone. The fried chicken was 80% burned batter with some token tidbits of chicken tucked inside. The burger was fine.   We discussed how to politely express our concerns to the waiter, but our opportunity never came--despite our plates being sent back heaped with uneaten food, no one asked us anything about how the meal was. I'm sorry to say that this was a big letdown overall.   We're not really sure what was going on last night. It's clear that this restaurant has some big ambitions, but the menu execution fell short and the service was inattentive. It was totally different than our consistently excellent experience at The Hub. From now on, we'll head there instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Hub.  I was excited to try this place out.  We were a little underwhelmed.  He tried the New York strip.  Asked for it well done and it came out medium.  Other than being the wrong temp, he said it tased pretty good.  We both loved the fries that it  came with.  I tried the Korean Short Ribs.  Wasn't impressed.  The short ribs were without flavor, thankfully the soba noodles were tasty.  I doubt that we will come back.  We will just stick with the Hub.  The menu is bigger at the Hub and the food is better."}
{"text":"I have to say that the vegetarian options here are the best that I have found in Phoenix, maybe anywhere. This is due to the variety, creativity and boldness. I mean, to have vegetarian 'meat'loaf that is as good as it is... flawless. The only downsides are that the appetizers are a bit too expensive (many cost more than entrees) and it can get loud because the seating is a lot of freestanding tables versus some more booths and more intimate, divided spaces. But, those are picky and minimal when compared to the menu and draft choices. Will be back... a lot."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Food is incredible. Came out super fast. The manager even stopped by a few times to make sure I was taken care of. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed Regular at the hub, expecting this to be more upscale, turned out to be just a little higher prices than the Hub with a smaller menu, Food is just your average bar food, and the ambiance is a non factor. Do not plan to return. Have visited the other Hub spinoffs and none of them are an improvement on the original. My recommendation to the owner is if it is not broken don't fix it."}
{"text":"Super stoked that there is a new spot for dinner around the corner from where my boyfriend and I live. I work in the industry as a server but I must say (whoever he was, he wasn't our server) approached our table within minutes of us sitting. He was a team player for our server. He got our drinks and helped us pick out an appetizer. Our server was a little frazzled but nothing to complain about. She was wearing glasses and had tattoos (don't know her name) but she was very prompt and had an awesome personality. But let's get to our apps. We had the spinach dip- BOMB!!! We then ordered a bacon burger (AMAZING) and  the seafood ciopinno (ehh so-so) The only complaint was that I wasn't fond of the sauce in the seafood dish but it was good overall. Another nice thing was the manager/owner approached our table and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. We will definitely be back. And who knows itmay become a regular place for dinner with it being so close to home."}
{"text":"Our order took a little long but the four of us enjoyed the food! My steak sandwich was great! The service was good and the ambiance of the place was good. I will definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We've been so excited for the Hub Nation to open this place. My husband and I are always working and on call, so we don't go west of Valvista (ya maybe we're getting older too!) Needless to say we were thrilled to hear that our fave bar was opening something a little more upscale for date night...which is usually in the middle of the week, because again we're busy and old. Drink menu was on point! The Union 212 was their version of an old fashioned and that went down smoothly. I was impressed by all the Arizona liquor and beer (who the hell knew that arizona has its own horseradish vodka). Can't wait to make my way down the list!  It was nice to see some unique and finer food options on the menu. Everything looked intriguing! We love a good board and their Union board did not disappoint with fine meats, cheeses, and lovely truffles eggs. The fried chicken was amazing but what set it over the top was the smoked agave syrup on the side. I literally could drink it! The manager Dustin (he's awesome!!) said they make all their own sauces so we definitely were impressed.   The East Valley definitely needed The Union Grill and Tap to open for those of us that don't want to travel far for finer food and a good time. We had a great time and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mac and Cheese!! My original order wasn't exactly what I expected but the manager took care of it and traded it for the Mac and Cheese which is awesome!   Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My burger was perfect, mouth watering, and juicy! No frozen patties here, you can tell they are made fresh on site! There is a nice drink and wine selection. I love the selection of draft and bottle craft beer! Definitely need to put this place on your list to try, you won't be disappointed! Service was spot on!"}
{"text":"This is a great location and the experience was nothing but remarkable. The service was great. We were greeted and seated right away. Very knowledgeable of the local beers and wines, and the two recommendations we took for beer were wonderful. Poutine appetizer was really good, as was the wake up call burger. Prices were a bit higher than expected but this is a more upscale bar so it's understandable. The food is NOT \"just your average bar food\" as another review says - not even close; it's trendy, modern, and delicious. We will absolutely be back and have plans to bring out of town guests very soon."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and it was great! Our server was super friendly and made suggestions to her favorites on the menu. The food was delicious, we had the bacon cheeseburger, Mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. We weren't a huge fan of the tomato soup but only because the consistency wasn't how we like. Also had the strawberry smash to drink and it was dangerously refreshing. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Large, well-shaded patio, emphasis on local sources for their food and beer, great selection of Arizona beers on tap, better-than-typical-bar menu, friendly service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the beer. This bar is a little dark and noisy, but folks seemed to be having fun. BTW, the name of the bar has nothing whatsoever with unions or support for unions."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time. Mother's Day!  Great service:) Food was really good and a unique menu. Ordered pork shank and polenta, pot roast, and Mac & Cheese. Delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Owned by the Hub which has the best wings ever and is also a great for kids - we really enjoyed Union Grill.  The food was delicious although a little pricey and the service was friendly and the actual restaurant was very well done and thought out.  When you go in be sure to ask where the name came from, it's a great story."}
{"text":"WOW! From the amazing service (Chad) to the amazing check-ups from the manager (Chris). We were so very well taken care of. I felt as though we were family.   Our server Chad made sure we wanted for nothing. The drinks, the food, and the experience were above our expectations. We had planned to dine elsewhere and just have drinks at Union,  however,  our plans changed when Chad began to sell us on their unique menu.    Chad changed all of our plans with his amazing customer service and salesmanship. Chad explained to all of our satisfaction the extent of the bar menu and the food menu.  I tried samples of beer and whiskey and I tried new things that I never would have tried before.  Our experience tonight as a family, including a 6 year old was beyond our expectations. We were so very pleased and could not say more about our experience here tonight.   We are very much looking forward to coming back. This is definitely a spot that welcomes date nights, singles and families as well. I reccomend the poutine fries, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"BEST FRY CHICKEN IN GILBERT AZ HANDS DOWN!!!  We love this place, this is not your typical BAR FOOD this is truly HOMEMADE delicious food with fresh ingredients it was just amazing.  Love the local AZ wine and beer selection. The chef came out and even introduce himself. Awesome place!!!"}
{"text":"The Pork Belly Poutine!!!! I could probably stop the review right there. This place was great. Tons of great local beer on tap, and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Attentive staff, overall good food- the fish and chips, burger and shrimp and grits were very good! My dad and I loved the local craft brews :) They are very kid friendly too and have a treasure chest that every child get's a toy to open the treasure chest with a key, that they give the kids.   I can't say enough about the friendly staff, but for the chef- the starters could use a make over."}
{"text":"Walking in the front door was an experience in itself. Staff was very friendly. Had Union burger for lunch with shoestring potatoes. Best burger since moving to Arizona. Iowa beef! Cole slaw was fresh and delicious. Server and service were A+."}
