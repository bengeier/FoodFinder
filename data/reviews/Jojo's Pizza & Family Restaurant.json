{"text":"Food is always great along with the service.  We get delivery every week and it's always hot and fresh and same great quality we receive in the resturant.  I'm hard to please with pizza along with their gluten free menu it is easy to feed our entire family.   Never have had a bad meal since we found this place a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Great food love the pizza friendly staff and fast food delivery what more do you need"}
{"text":"Everything was great until I opened up the strawberry jam from the cheesecake to find mold.

Pretty disappointing they would let that go out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"Jo Jo's is a small, unpretentious family restaurant in a stripmall near our house.  We have gone there since they have opened (maybe 10 years ago ?) and I must say that their pizza is generally pretty decent, although my personal favorite is Streets of New York.  The kids like their pizza quite a bit, I think it may be that the sauce has a high sugar content.  Either way, the pizza will not disappoint you, but will likely not knock your socks off.  It is an inexpensive place, which is a nice nod.  Their service is generally very good and the servers are friendly.  Personally, their chicken wings are awesome!  In total, I would go with 4 of 5 stars, with their wings being a 5 of 5."}
{"text":"ordered wings with blue cheese delivered to hotel. Maybe I'm picky, but they gave me ranch instead. I can't stand ranch and really craving wings w/blue cheese which is the whole reason we ordered from them. When I called, the guy on the phone was really short with me. The manager was better and did offer to bring the blue cheese, but by then I was in the car driving in search of fast food.

Been a really really bad day after months of veggies and lean proteins, stressful job, kids and I wanted a treat... a night to myself with a splurge dinner, a room to myself and HBO. I got curt service, no apology; which is probably what made me hit the roof. A simple \"I'm sorry\" instead of \"what, you want us to deliver blue cheese?\" would have been better. By the time the manager called me back; which he did after I hung up since I was tired of being on hold (kudos for him), I was tired, angry and didn't want a damn thing to do with them anymore.

I heard the sandwich was good, so go in person, get your own food, but check the order"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and salads here! This is our go to pizza place on the weekends. Their house Italian dressing (red wine vinegar) is so good. Wait staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"I'm on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Maricopa County that I have found to get a great Stromboli. I am not sure why the other spots cannot get it right. Anyway, I live a good 20 minutes away and will still drive to Jojo's for a stromboli. They just have it down so that it is perfect every time."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Everything is awesome especially the gluten free wings. They are actually better than the regular ones!  If you love Italian and have a gluten free family member think of JoJos!"}
{"text":"Saw the cook picking his nose. As he prepared dough and pizza ingredients.  
Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Called ahead. Dozen wings to go. Sure 10 minutes. Show up in 20 minutes. Oh they will be up in 5 minutes. Why? We like them to be hot out the door. That will be $8.53. Okay. Wings come up 10 wings. We ordered a dozen. Oh they don't come that way.  So why didn't you tell me these things when I called."}
{"text":"Pizza is...okay, but then again I find 99.9% of pizza in this state completely inedible, being a New York pizza snob. So the fact it's okay translates to \"it's amazing\" by Arizona standards. 

The stromboli however is PHENOMENAL. Crispy outside, moist inside, fresh meats and mountains of cheese. Perfect every time. Very friendly and fast service as well."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a super lazy Sunday afternoon since I wanted pizza more than anything. We got a pizza topped with meatballs and sausage. I liked the sausage, but I think there could have been a few more meatballs. We also got the french fries as an app. They were crispy and delicious!

The service was pretty good, we got refills pretty quickly and the food came fast. It wasn't too busy, but it also was a weird time to eat. The ambiance is just a little hole in the wall-tables and booths with some pictures of people I did not recognize on the wall. I would probably come back!"}
{"text":"I visited during lunch hours and received 2 massive, and delicious, slices of pie with a drink for only five dollars. On top of that the staff was friendly and they had on some good music. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Went here on Sat afternoon after a team softball practice.  It was decent food and they offered a variety of items.  Out of 7 people, 3 got pizza, 2 got wings, and 2 got salad.  The pizza was decent, nothing to write home about but adaquate.  

The service wasn't bad, but it also wasn't really friendly.  Kinda got the feeling the waitress was annoyed at something else and didn't really want to be there.

It was a bit hot in there and it seemed like they didn't want to turn on the AC for some reason, either that or the AC just isn't strong enough to cool down the whole place.

Prices were about average.

Would I go there again?  If it was with a group and every else wanted to go sure, if i was on my own it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We LOVE JoJo's! My family and I have been coming here for over a decade and we still eat there regularly. The pizza is great, the ranch is fantastic, and the service has always been awesome. My only complaint and the only reason they didn't get five stars is when you eat in the restaurant you can have as much Ranch as you want at no extra charge, but if I order two large pizzas for carryout and want extra sides of ranch, they charge $0.50 per side of ranch. I could understand if I'm asking for an exuberant amount of ranch or if I only ordered a slice of pizza ect but ordering two large pizzas and 40 Wings should warrant at least a few complimentary sides of ranch."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and accurate and food was very good for pizza delivery.  We loved the Mediterranean pizza!"}
{"text":"For quite some years now I have been going to JoJo's pizza because it's my favorite place for some pizza & wings. I couldn't say one thing bad about the way everything tastes but the service definitely has changed up, I ordered a 10 piece plain wings & couldn't even get the full 10 amount of wings I was paying for, I was going to say something about it but never said anything because the waitress who was serving us seemed to being under some stress you could tell but they have started to slack on services for costumers."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. LOVE the food. 

Problem; on our order made this week (delivery pizza & wings) our entire family AND extended family got food poisoning. (there is no way it was a bug, only people affected were those who ate chicken wings)"}
{"text":"Delish Stromboli ...takes a bit of time but well worth the wait ...service was good too"}
{"text":"Great all around! Good prices, friendly staff, and satisfy-your-cravings-pizza-and-wings! I ordered the combo that came with a big slice of pizza and wings (perfect for lunch). I had the buffalo wings and an olive pizza. From the crispiness of the wings and the rich flavor of the pizza sauce: delish."}
{"text":"Great little family pizza joint. Good food @reasonable prices. Nothing fancy but it's awesome after a day out at the water park!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. I was advised by my uncle after moving to the area that this was THE place for pizza in my hood. He was right. The pizza is yummy, calzones are amazing and the salads are delicious! This is a great place to go for pie!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from a hotel, delivery was early and accurate. We got a meat pizza, toasted ravioli, garlic knots and cheese- tomato garlic bread. The garlic bread was just ok, not much garlic flavor, the ravioli was wonderful, particularly with their red sauce. Husband enjoyed the meat pizza, and the garlic knots had good flavor and texture. Homemade ranch was good too. Didn't think to ask for plates and silverware, being that we were in a hotel, but I always appreciate it when the restaurant asks or the delivery person brings them anyway. Regardless, great food."}
{"text":"This place is great. Highly recommended....in fact we are doing our weekly(at least) order right now!

All of the salads are great, especially Antipasto. You can tell that they use very fresh ingredients. The chicken alfredo and meat lovers pizza are great, I'm more of a straight pepperoni guy, but sometime enjoy the specialty pies. Mozz sticks are best around and we recently just ordered a ton of wings for football and they were amazing.

Thanks for NEVER disappointing!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, wings, and a Philly cheesesteak for delivery. 
Delivery time was normal for the order-and the delivery gentleman was polite enough.

I'll admit, I think the overall price was a little steep-however the pizza was the best I've tasted in a while. We had veggies and chicken (a little light on the chicken for the money). There was a balance to the dough and the sauce that just worked. 
I decided to try their ranch sauce with my second piece, now that was something special. Very good ranch. 
The philly....pleasantly light on grease, but also light on flavor. I did not try the wings as I was full at that point. 
I would certainly order here again."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good, and most of the pasta.  Though last time I got the spaghetti with sausage.  On the menu they list sausage marinara which I took as pasta with sausage for 9.95, but that is not the case.  You have to order the pasta with a side of sausage. The spaghetti was almost $14, and it certainly was not worth $14.

Stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"Great Place! Jojo's is the best pizza in the area and they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza place.  We love their sausage pizza, we like that it is crumbles instead of huge chunks of sausage.  We've also their garlic knots a few times and they are great as well.  They both reheat in the oven great the next day!  We fight over the leftovers!"}
{"text":"Great food, got the pizza, wings and Stromboli for a big group. Garlic knots are great too.  Everyone was very happy. Stromboli took forever but they discounted our ticket. Stromboli was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. The wings are the best.and my favorite is the chicken pot pie soup. Staff is always right on it. Thank you"}
{"text":"Popped in here mid-afternoon when i was in the area.  It's a nice, casual, locally-owned pizza joint.  They have a number of tvs to catch a game, but only half of them are flat screen.  Music is fairly loud for a restaurant.

They have tasty thin crust pizza, and they will serve by the slice for just a couple bucks.

Basic beer and wine selection, but they do have blue moon & sam adams on tap.

Friendly service and pretty good prices.  Would be a good place to 
go catch a game or have dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Our pregnant waitress was so rude that we walked out !!!!! Will never return to this place when I come back here from California ... we (Californians)aren't even that RUDE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Being a family of NY pizza snobs, we have struggled to find decent pizza delivery in Phoenix. At our previous address, we found Lucky's Pizza and Il Primo's, which were good alternatives to the national pizza chains, which I loathe.
Moving to our new place, we've struggled even more to find something edible for delivery. At first, we tried Brother's, which was atrocious for pizza. The sauce was decent, but the crust was always soggy, and the service left something to be desired.

Fast forward to a friend mentioning Jojo's, which I wasn't aware of. I will say that we have a new pizza joint to stick with. 

I wouldn't come close to comparing this to actual NY pizza, but for a snob, it fits the bill when you want good pizza. The crust is always crispy and the service has been outstanding. If they would only spice up the sauce a bit more, and not be so on the sweeter side, I would give this 5 stars.

A standard order for us has to include the white pizza. Theirs is awesome. The balance of olive oil, garlic, ricotta, and mozzarella cheeses is phenomenal."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I totally would!! We have been coming to JoJo's for years and never had a bad experience, until tonight. It amazes me that when they made a mistake the teenagers behind the counter were so rude and unhelpful. I called in at 6:23 to place our pick up order, Conner, said it would be 20 minutes. And the total was $35.10. We ordered 2 pizzas, a cheese and a Chicken Alfredo. We have to drive to the store location as they don't deliver to our house. We get to the store at 7:05, this is now 40 minutes after the call was placed and 20 minutes after our order should have been ready. We walk in and there is no order for us at all, they him and haw for another 5+ minutes, looking for our order. At this point were upset that we just drove all the way here and are now going to have to wait another 20 minutes. Conner even said that he remembered speaking to me, I also remembered the total before he rang up the next order. When we got up to pay I asked if we were still going to have to pay $35.10, he almost laughed and said \"yes,I can't do anything!\" I said so we are going to to wait another 20 minutes even though we called almost an hour ago and you didn't place our order? He said well I can take a dollar off?? A dollar for us to have to waste more time, on your mistake!! We said never mind. As we were walking out Conner said see-ya, super rude. As a Manger myself I would never not only want some little jack off kid treating customers who have been coming for years like crap, but he doesn't deserve the $10 bucks an hour either!! He was rude and we will take our business to a pizza place that treats their customer's right!! We always try to help small local business , but this was a horrid experience, and frankly doesn't deserve our money or good word of mouth.

To sum it we placed an order, took 40 minutes to get there, order not ready, kids behind the counter are jokes, specifically Conner, offers us $1 dollar off our $35 dollar order and laughed at us. We took our business else where and will never suggest JoJo's again!!!"}
{"text":"Jojos is the most efficient delivery restaurant I have ever seen they are incredibly prompt. And their food is quite good for quick pizzeria food. It's always s go to emergency meal when I forget my fridge is empty and I'm starving. Thank you jojos!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. I came here today after spending the day at wet n wild. My bf and i shared a house salad and lasagna. The house garden was very fresh and delicious. The lasagna was delicious too! The sauce was good i dont know if it was homemade but it was yummy. The prices are reasonable $8.5 for a lasagna and $6 for a large garden salad is pretty good for me. I wish i could come here often we live in tempe so it would be a drive. Definitely coming back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is fast, friendly & so good.  Exciting to see there is still a regular pizza joint that has Italian food but is not a chain.  They are relaxed, affordable, not fancy & overpriced.  Just right for a pizza place after a game or whatever.  We love building our own Calzone. They do a great job.  Also, I really like that their salad dressings are all homemade."}
{"text":"very good pizza, great customer service but the Oktoberfest was stale! how could they neglect such a good beer like that. it is for this reason that I'm not giving five stars. my buddy and I went and it was a very nice crowd. super good crust"}
{"text":"Yo dawg let me tell ya what up, this shit. Is fire. The pizza: bomb
Calzone: bomb
Wings: dank af 
Servers: chill (super cool): Billy & Connor 
Overall had a dope experience at this little place would for sure come again. Keep it skippy JoJos!"}
{"text":"Awesome family place great staff! I ordered two pizzas and the waiter brought it to my attention how I could make it cheaper by getting a larger pizza and half and half it. Who does that? A restaurant whose customers are their priority. Awesome service and GREAT pizza."}
{"text":"I've been to JoJo's Pizza twice and have been blown away with both the food and the service. The wings are some of the best that I've had and the pizza is fantastic. Both times I've had excellent service and a friendly wait person. The place is always packed, so you know the food is good.

Beer runs about $8 a pitcher and there isn't a happy hour."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Wings!!!  I really like Jojo's Pizza for two reasons.  The Food and the Price.  The Pizza is really good and the Wings are some of the best I've ever had.  Make sure you order them extra crispy.  I normally get my Pizza and Wings to go, but eating here isn't a bad idea either.  The service is good.  I just wish there was one on my side of town."}
{"text":"Been to JoJos a few times and always enjoy the food.

The pizza is good. The sauce is good and the crust is good. Toppings are good. Everything is good.

Stromboli is ok. I think that it would help if the dough was stretched a little more as it tends to be really thick causing the end product to be all about the dough and very little about the goodies stuffed inside.

JoJos does everything well but falls a bit shorty of great. It's the place to go for friendly service, fair prices and good food."}
{"text":"Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by, or maybe I've become a Pizza snob, I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card.  Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered up a House Special.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes before we'd have it, pretty standard and generally this is an under-promise over deliver type thing.  This is where we started off on the wrong foot.  I called an hour later to get a status of the pizza, it was out for delivery.  An hour and 10 minutes after placing the order we had it in our hands.  And I have to say, even if they did deliver on time, I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon, it just wasn't all that great, everything was pretty bland.  Order here if you need a pizza and any pizza will do and you have the time to wait."}
{"text":"This place has been going down hill for the last year. They changed their menu to make everything al a cart. The fries that once came with the sandwich are now $1.50. The whole sandwich you buy is now cut in half. The sauce on the pizza is so sweet. I am happy that the staff get along so well but they pay more attention to each than the customers. I have been in many times hoping it was just a small oversight but it isn't. It was nice to have a neighborhood Pizza spot but this just isn't it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! First time here but definitely not the last!!!

Next time I'm going for the Stromboli"}
{"text":"I stopped by Jojo's tonight around 9:15PM to grab a slice of good ol' cheese pizza. I love me some cheese pizza, yessum.

The pizza wasn't outstanding & it wasn't terrible either. There was just somethin about the taste that I didn't fancy, probably the sauce.

I won't go out of my way to hit Jojo's again, but if you're in a bind and need a slice in the North valley, you might want to give em a shot. They also have a selection of Italian dishes, which I have not tried."}
{"text":"Love their food love their service it's great for a casual dining or a team get together they really do a great job"}
{"text":"wow is all I can say...this place lost my business and others that go there unless they fix in general not my personal friends.Had family down from northern cal, telling them how great this place is...now Im looking like the laughing stock of the fam.... maybe it was because of the mayweather/gregor fight but that is not acceptable...spent 60 bucks on 2 pizzas and 20 wings for pick up...first off the wings were the size of golf tees or basically small asf...never seen this in my life, I did call and complain, because I was dumbfounded..they did say others complained as well...so supposeldy ill have a credit on my acct for free wings, because that was embarrassing to my family and friends...

   .2nd lets get to the pizza...I really dont know what to say...Pizza gets worse and worse every time I go...this time was even worse, 2 large pep/mush sas/mush nooooo flavor at all i even smothered it with ranch and wing sauce, no flavor...would have rather had little Cesars ...very sad for a restaurant that claims to be a family restaurant with good food...and to top it off I claimed that this place would knock their socks off, and it was a disaster.. to the owner....either hire new people or change your ingredients because that pizza was worse than a dominos order..

Sad"}
{"text":"My husband is Italian, like straight from Italy, so his standards for pizza are pretty high.  He does not like Pizza Hut and thinks most American \"pizza\" is a joke.  We decided to try JoJo's because my boss from work suggested it and gave us a really awesome coupon, \"One free medium cheese pizza.\"  Whenever we order pizza from a new place we always want to try their anchovies with green olives because first, It's my favorite and second, anchovies and olives are a rare topping choice so it's good to see if and how they produce this pizza.  It was a great surprise when we found out they have three diff type of olives and huge anchovies!  This alone said a lot about their selection and their toppings were generous in comparison to others.  The pizza was delicious and we definitely come here often for their pizza.  They have a nice diner area and I hear that they are actually local. Their prices are also reasonable. One last VERY VERY important thing... make sure to check the ads in your mail because they occasionally will put coupons out which they honor and are such good deals!  We really recommend JOJO's rather than opting for the more well known chain pizza parlors!  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Jojo's has been stepping up their game lately...I figured with them u just have to be detailed ...I always get a large well done cheese with 20  sloppy wings ...well done and sloppy are key words here...also their customer service is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. It's a family friendly environment. The food is excellent! Sometimes it gets really busy and the service may suffer. However, it's still worth wait even then."}
{"text":"Moved far away from JoJos - they will still deliver!  Always a fair price, always excellent food.  

Keep up the good work Jim and crew!

One a side note....Many of the employees at JoJos have been there for years...This says quite a bit about the owner and how well he treats his people.

Trust me, go there and enjoy.  Call and have the food delivered and enjoy.  JoJos is a true keeper."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food and the staff is friendly!  I had to write a review because all the reviews are about their pizza. Now don't get me wrong, their pizza is tasty.  But their Stromboli and calzones are amazing!  It's why I go there.  That and their cookizza.  Holy cow, it is mouthwatering goodness every time we eat it!  If you came and didn't think the pizza was all that, you have to at least give these options a go!"}
{"text":"Food is always great!! Picked up pizza and wings for lunch today. Took about 20mim and it was hot, fresh, and delicious! We love the medium wings here."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I'm craving pizza. Prompt service every time and pizza is always perfect. Sandwiches awesome too. Very family friendly, kids love it. Every time I order delivery they typically quote me 45 minutes but I've never waited longer than 30."}
{"text":"A great owner operated pizza place that is the anti-chain.  Jim the owner knows his customers, he hires local kids, and he serves great food.  If you're in the neighborhood this is a must eat."}

Thank you FELLOW YELPERS!


I ordered a chefs salad
4 stars for taste 
3 stars for quality of food.

Also ordered garlic knots ( $2.75) a large pepperoni pizza (12.75 + 1.75 for EACH topping) 


Parking was tight, but we easily found a spot. 

5 star service 
Waiter was great 

I ordered ranch. No extra charge 
I ordered a side of olives. No extra charge. 


I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in the valley. You can order it by the slice with any toppings. 

This is the only place I eat chicken wings at because they are crispy and aren't those extra large chicken legs you get elsewhere. 

Get a Buffalo Chicken Calzone with no ricotta. It's my favorite."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza n wings and cold beer after softball at Victory Lanes. Philly Cheese steak sandwiches are very good. Great prices."}
{"text":"we've been ordering from jojo's for about 6 years. i like the cheese they use here ... very tasty! and the wings ... oh dear, the wings. order them sloppy if you like them with lots of sauce. they deliver to my 'hood, which is rare and appreciated, but truth be told i don't mind picking up my pie because the people working there are always friendly and smart. i should order from jojo's more ... i really should. i kinda forget about them when it is pizza-ordering time, but i shouldn't. there isn't anything unmemorable about this place."}
{"text":"Been a customer since they opened and back when they only had half the size restaurant they have now.  Great wings, awesome sandwiches and the pizza is REAL pizza. Delivery is always.my preferred choice.  Long time customer and not going anywhere!"}
{"text":"The food was good when I finally got it, I waited 20 minutes for 1 slice of pizza and a salad and it wasn't busy I was on my 30 minute lunch break so I had to inhail my food needless to say I won't be going back"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Jo Jo's for 7 years. By far one if the best Pizza's in the Phoenix area. We usually do take out and if its late a delivery they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Super casual pizza joint with plenty of TVs to watch games on! Came in here with my BF for a random afternoon lunch and since we're from SoCal, he didn't really understand what my hype about their half pound of fries were all about. I guess he knows now! *smirk*

So why 4 stars and not 5? The service is kinda slow, I really don't like walking up to the pick up counter to ask for condiments or what not every so often."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the salads! I'll use this restaurant as take out only - the country music has got to go!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good sides, and most of all a delivery guy who seemed to care and genuinely asks \"please keep us in mind next time\". With a smile. 6 stars if I could. 

- the guy in Marriott that ordered delivery this evening."}
{"text":"Well, I guess JoJo's must be doing something right. They've been in business for almost twenty years and were absolutely jam-packed with families on the Wednesday evening that I stopped by. Although whatever it is they might be doing right, I can assure you, it's certainly not their single pizza slices.

I stopped in during dinner hours and ordered a couple of pepperoni slices to take home. The price was on par with what you'd find at competing restaurants. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the second slice before tossing it - which rarely happens with pizza.

After reading some of these reviews that praise JoJo's for their pizza, I'm not sure if this was a hiccup with the preparation or if customer judgment is clouded by convenience and a lack of competition. I mean, to my knowledge, there are no other sit-down restaurants on this Pinnacle strip with the exception of fast food chains. 

Sauce and cheese had a very processed flavor, which ended up clumping together to form that gross matted and rubbery texture that is a staple of the pizza that I'd wolf down in college to combat hunger because nothing else was available. This is not a good thing.

I'm still a bit baffled. Maybe ordering full pizzas or wings with ranch are where the true appeal lies? I'm not sure. And honestly, it's pretty unlikely that I'll ever find out."}
{"text":"Today was the 3rd and last try we will give this place. The wait staff is only polite to their regulars at the bar top. The first time the pizza was ok, but the service was slow.
2nd time the pizza was ok, salad was ok but the waitress was extremely slow, I asked for the check when we were done she went up to the bar and talked to a \"friend\" for almost 10 minutes. I then walked up and asked for the check and paid another waitress. Today we walked in, they were slow, and it's a seat yourself, so we found a booth for the family. All of them were dirty but a young man was working on cleaning them :-). The waitress came over and put some silverware and plates down, I asked if the table could be wiped down and she gave me attitude and said very snotty, \"ok, but then you need to get out\". We did, but after we got up, she walked away and I said I'm done with the wait staff here, and we spent our money at a different establishment that is polite and not rude."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years now...it's a weekly must visit for me these days.  The lunch specials are an amazing deal!  Although sit down service only, don't be scared to go on a lunch break.  They are always quick to greet you and can easily accommodate a speedy visit. 

Now, why do I come here so much? It's the pizza. Plain cheese slice pizza. I am from NJ and had pizza in NYC growing up a lot. So I know what good American pizza is 'supposed to' taste like. Not to be confused with true Italian pizza... This pizza is a little thicker than the foldable boardwalk pie in Atlantic City or Seaside but that's what makes it so good to me. It's very filling and I find myself splitting the 2 slice lunch more often than not. That leaves room for the cinnamon dessert! 

As far as taste, it's very neutral. Most foodies like to taste a ton of flavors and herbs at once in a sauce...not me.  A Foodie that hates herbs?!?  Well, I'm a supertaster (look that up if you never heard of it, you can test to see if you are too) .  For example apples taste like wood to me, makes sense as it is a baby wooden tree kinda...anyway, so what tastes like basil to you tastes like lawnmower clippings to me..well..what they smell like anyway.  Ever smell something that smells good but you could never eat or drink? Gasoline for example ... I digress. 

Personally I can't stand anything green on my pizza. Oregano, basil, cilantro you name it. I really dislike sauces that taste 'green' to me that have oregano or the like already mixed in. The sauce here is sweet and tastes like tomato.  I'm sure there's seasonings but not too much is what I'm sayin' ... For comparison, Fired Pie's sauce has 'green tasting'  seasonings I don't care for. 1000 degrees has a perfectly balanced red sauce. 

Lastly the cheese. Never greasy or stringy and I have never wasted a morsel. You know what I mean? Ever had 'birthday party pizza' so bad that you took half the \"cheese\" off to just make it edible? Not here. Never. You can tell the quality in every bite.  Tastes the same every time and if you are like me, and like cheese pizza the best, give it a try...does feel a little weird tipping on a $5 tab though. 20% is a dollar but what a steal $$$!"}

Two star rating based on feeling unwelcome towards the end of their day.  Not much welcoming feeling if you arrive with a group 45 minutes before posted closing time.  At least 2 times arriving 30-40 minutes before close and half the chairs are up and a door is locked.  I understand people workers want to go home, but in the restaurant business, it's usually nice to have a neighborhood place that makes you feel welcomed before closing time.  Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Always loved this place, I've been coming here since elementary and now I'm in my 30s. The staff are great and the atmosphere is awesome. Would recommend"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd trip to JoJos and, as always, they fail to disappoint. The service is friendly, the food delicious and the atmosphere reminiscent of the pizza joints I grew up with back in NY. 

We always make it a point to stop by and have some pizza when we're up on this side of town. The menu is very versatile, offering much of your standard pizza place fare as well as some different choices thrown in for variety. And if you are a sports fan, the 8 screens surrounding the place are always tuned to sporting events to satisfy anyone's taste.

Anyone who is up in the Pinnacle Peak area should make it a point to stop in, take a rest from the road and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"Good food, a little overpriced for the quality. The menu is quite large though, and they deliver to our home (which few restaurants do)."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for delivery in 30 mins or less. Pizza is great the wings are top notch an no one beats their salads. If you like spicy I highly recommend the philly sandwich with jalapeños and a side of aus jus. Yumm In this neighborhood for the price it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"JoJo's rocks! I love this place! Good food, fair prices and they always get my order right! I'll be back JoJo! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My Fiance and I love going to Jojos. We love the atmosphere, it's always clean, the service is good and I really like that they don't act fake, they act like real people. And HOT DAMN THOSE WINGS. No one makes wings like Jojos!! Pizza is also great, way better then those stupid trying to be fancy pizza places that are all over the place now-a-days. I always recommend Jojo's to my friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been regular customers of JoJos since we moved into out home in 2008. They treat us like family each time we are there. Most recently the owner went out of his way to ensure that they stick Gluten Free beer for me since I recently found out about my intolerance. My husband enjoys their pizza, wings and garlic bread. I enjoy their fresh salads and chicken potpie soup. Wonderful place, wonderful people and all around great food! I always introduce a friend to their food and they always want to go back!"}
{"text":"I like the food but the last 4 times I've ordered delivery they got it wrong. I love the fried ravioli. Pizza is good and I don't really like pizza. I like the Stromboli and calzones."}
{"text":"This is the pizza my entire family loves. Also the breadsticks. I love the meatballs! And they make their own ranch dressing which I dip everything in it is that good. There have been a few times where it didn't come perfect but they are on the ball with making it right. I love going to places like this where I feel like they actually know me and I see the familiar faces each week with big smiles. 
Oh, their terriyaki (sp?) sauce is really yummy."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and boneless buffalo wings! Better than any chain pizza love that it's local and so close! Great customer service from dining in to the deliveries! And they do root beer floats :)"}
{"text":"I have been to jojo's many times and it is my choice for great pizza on the northwest side.   The pizza is fresh and consistently good. Reminds me of my pizzeria that I owned back in NJ.  I have had the salads, chicken parm, eggplant parm and it's all good. The food comes out quick considering they are usually busy and the staff is knowledgable and attentive. Even though I pass two other pizza places on my way to JOJO's ....it's worth it. I give JOJO\"s    8 pizza dough's outta 10 ....."}
{"text":"I'm in the area all the time and decided to finally give it a try. That was a mistake. I asked about a pizza and wings combo special, and went with the large cheese and 20 wings. Nothing special about it and at a cost of pennies from $30.00 that is no special! The large cheese was terrible using some skim milk / imitation cheese and there was almost no cheese on the pizza and a bit undercooked. Teriyaki wings were good however the teriyaki was a watery sauce and I prefer the thick kind, but they had decent flavor. I would try this place again but definitely not for the pizza as the rest of the menu has some things I would like to try."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings, every time! Reasonably priced and a family favorite for sure :)"}
{"text":"Being in the area for a wedding brought us to this place on New Year's Day.  My family was hungry and looking forward to a good pizza.  Seat yourself was nice, but that was it.  The service was horrible and bordered rude.  She made a snide comment, barking that the menus stayed ON the table,  couldn't give us a realistic expectation on the size of certain appetizers and salads, and constantly chatted with another server who wasn't doing anything but taking up space.  The pizza was greasy and not crisp on the bottom.  A total disappointment for us!   The icing on the cake was after the bill was dropped off- we had to search for her behind the bar in order to pay!  I would NOT recommend this place for anything!  It's a complete and total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I've always liked this pizza but it's grown on me even more over the past few months.  I love the atmosphere of Times Square down the street, but sometimes there pizza has too much cheese on it and they don't always cook it well done when I ask.  So I've found myself ordering in Jojo's more and more.  I love the taste of the sauce and it has just the right amount of cheese!  They've got great salads too.  The delivery men are always friendly and arrive in a timely manner."}
{"text":"We really like the atmosphere here very friendly but ordered a chicken ceaser salad .... chicken was not fresh cooked refrigerated chicken cooked at another time had multiple piece that were discolored and tasted like balsamic vinaigrette???? Any way won't order that ever again. Over all most food here was fantastic in the past that's why I give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise...another pizza review.

I was looking to try a new pizza joint and this place came up in my Yelp search.  I decided to look up their menu online, and place an order for a 14 inch cheese pizza. This place is only about 8-10 minutes from work, about 2 miles off the 17 and Pinnacle Peak.  My total was just under $13.00.  I took the pizza back to work.  Here is how it was..............

Cheese Pizza-  It looked good.  The size was good.  The taste though?  Eh...it was just alright.  The cheese was plentiful and tasted alright.  The sauce was not that good though.  It seriously tasted like the jarred \"pizza sauce\" you can buy off the shelf at the grocery store.  It didn't have much flavor and for the most part, just wasn't good.  The crust on the pizza was fairly thin.  I kept picking up an odd taste in the dough.  It was kind of hard to describe, but it was far from good...like it had no flavor!  I struggled to make it through 4 slices which is incredibly rare.  If a pizza is good, I can put away a whole one.  Unfortunately, I gave the rest away to some fellow co workers.

The guy who answered the phone and the lady who rang me up were very friendly and nice.  Sadly though, the pizza was not really that good and I can't see myself ever coming back here.  Exactly what 2 stars is.....Meh.  I've experienced better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Combo Calzone. The crust is delicious and it has the perfect combination of cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and veggies. I eat it sans sauce (why mess with those lovely flavors), but my hubby likes the sauce. Their pizza is pretty great - thin, New York-style. It's a nice, family-owned restaurant with an owner who has supported the kids in our community for many, many years. Well worth stopping by."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit when I am home! It has amazing food and great service! The staff are super friendly. It can get super busy, but it is totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday eve with local family. Very good service, fast, attentive with drinks and special sliced pizza for baby granddaughter. Reasonably priced, large menu selection of salads, 3 soups, pasta and sandwiches. I sampled cheese pizza, wife's pasta and ordered a chicken parm sand. Not overly impressed with sauce, I like it spicier and heartier, kind of bland and sweet.

{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside. Hell, it doesn't look like much on the inside. But they do make a pretty mean fettuccine Alfredo. Service is usually pretty prompt too. Might almost be better to take it home though. I might do that next time since I live so close. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I hear their pizza is pretty good too. I will definitely be back here many times."}
{"text":"We have only had Jojo's pizza from take out, we have never eaten in the restaurant.  However, every single time we order pizza from this restaurant it is consistently delicious!  The white pizza is amazing if you love garlic, and the crust is thin and crispy with a nice chew.  The red sauce is also delicious.  We duke it out for leftovers the next day!  More expensive than a quick weeknight Little Caesar's run to be sure, but the quality and flavor make the price worth it."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since we moved to AZ in 2005. Every time we get excellent service, great food at very reasonable price. My recommendation try their cheese steak stamboli.........."}
{"text":"We loooooove the pizza here. They also have amazing wings + their ranch is the very best."}
{"text":"For 4:30 on a Thursday, this place is packed!! A lot of regulars... This was our first time here and everyone was friendly, but busy! Pizza was good. I've had better crust before, but still really good. Breadsticks were ok. Sauce is good. Very reasonable. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Oh JoJos, how I love you! This is quite the establishment. Friendly workers and great food that make you feel at home! Their pizza is divine and no other place is quite like theirs! I have gone vegan but this place will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Great location on Pinnacle Peak with no real pizza competition for miles.  Parking is adequate, and seating wasn't too bad during lunch hour.

Lunch slice special was par for the course, with 2 slices and drink for around $5.  Sauce was above average and homemade, but everything else was mediocre at best - crust, cheese, toppings.  Service was ok, menu selection is typical pizza/pasta delivery joint menu with a few basics and fried apps.  I wouldn't avoid eating here in the future but I would make a notable effort to find pizza elsewhere if I'm craving a slice."}
{"text":"I read the review on the calzone and ordered one as a delivery. They were nice on the phone, but very rushed. The taste was ok, nothing special. The price for that and wings, including delivery, was almost $24.00. Then with the tip it was almost $30.00. It seems very expensive for food that was ok, not the best. Based on the price and taste will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Nice family owned/smaller establishment.  Lots of locals/neighbors appear to go there.  Their pizza was very similar to Sbarro like you eat at the mall food court (which i like and think is better than most).  Highly recommend and we're looking forward to trying again :)"}
