{"text":"This golf course was horrible. They call it a country club but should change the name to oak wood retirement facility. Way overpriced for the course conditions and the clubs that my father rented from them looked like they were used in the medieval times."}
{"text":"Arrived about 7:30 and there seemed to be several groups teeing off. Checking in was a bit slow. Three people behind the counter and only one person was taking our group of 60. But once checked in, I headed to the golf cart and noticed that the driving range and putting greens were completely crowded. What the heck, warming up is overrated.
The course was in great shape, Lakes was really a challenge and the Palms greens were pretty slick."}
