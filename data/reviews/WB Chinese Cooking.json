{"text":"Enjoy spicy food? You have to go to this place. The restaurant is always packed like crazy! The fish was nice. Eventhough I'm not a big fan of the cold shredded chicken, it was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a review of WB Chinese cooking new location in Richmond Hill. We love how you can choose the type of fish (fresh or frozen), sauces and add other ingredients. The fish came out in a big pot with a divider in the centre with the two flavours. We ordered the frozen turbot ($30), half fish in a peppercorn based chilli sauce and another half in preserved pickled vegetables. We also added extra side order of pork intestines. The fish portion was big enough for two people. We also ordered lamb skewers and it was grilled to perfection, flavours were spot on."}
{"text":"We quite enjoyed how you can choose the type of fish cooked in two different soup base and add extra ingredients into the 'hotpot'. We ordered the turbot cooked in Szechuan spicy oil and mustard vegetables. The turbot fish is meaty, silky smooth texture and do not have lots of bones. Both soup base was packed with flavours and the portion is good enough for two. They also serve grilled seafood, meat skewers and noodles."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Walked out before ordering. Don't waste time here."}
{"text":"Seeing as how every menu item at W.B. Cooking had a picture of a chili next to it, I'd say you have to like spicy food to eat here. But it's not the in-your-face can't-taste-anything-else type of spice, it slowly creeps up on you until at the end of the meal you realize you're panting and need a drink of water.  At least that is how I would describe my experience with the table-cooked fish, which is their specialty. It was a totally interesting food experience that I haven't seen much until recently. Basically you order an entire fish, some side veggies and dishes for you to cook alongside it, and then it sits on your table in a bit of broth/sauce with fire under it to keep it simmering and you throw your uncooked side veggies in there to cook. It's the kind of meal that takes awhile to eat and is great for cold blustery nights.  The decor of the restaurant was very clean and modern, and just a nice comfy place to hang out. They had booths, tables, and large private rooms, so it would be a great place to have anything from a two-person meal to a large group dinner.  Service was pleasant and nothing to complain about.  I wasn't entirely sure if the servers would know how to speak English or not, but the menu does have English on it so I assume so, but it did feel pretty \"Chinese\" in there - not by the decor but just by the people.  I'd definitely call it an authentic experience, worth a try."}
{"text":"The spicy BBQ Fish is very oily, choose the non-spicy one. The eggplant pot is really good. Better environment than the restaurant beside but the the taste is not as good as that, especially the fish."}
{"text":"This can't be called as boiled fish. You can totally call it garbage, litter ,rubbish or trash!!!! Don't go there! The service there is f*cking horrible. I told the waitress it's salty and not spicy because I chose the two pepper flavor. She said it was spicy and didn't give us the Yakult."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has been flying under the radar, but this place is fantastic.   Went in for some boiled fish. Love extra spicy food, and ordered the spicy cod. You get to add a lot of different items in the pot with the fish. We basically added everything under the sun into the pot. Came out and it was fantastic.   Tried the skewers and it was great too. Extra spicy, and really fresh. Don't get the beef tendons though...They were tough and chewy...Not what I was expecting. The lotus root and the stir-fry cabbage was great..again, very spicy...For all those who don't like spicy food, this place may not be the right place for you.   Kids weren't a fan because the non spicy food had a little spice to it.   Service was great. If you didn't understand the menu, they would tell you and walk you through the order. I haven't tried the fresh fish yet, but it is on my to do list."}
{"text":"This place is different from your regular Chinese restaurant in the GTA. Most of the food here are spicy. I think their defining dish is the table cooking fish pot. You get a fresh fish cooked with your choice of toppings in a rectangular pot. It's something you can't find elsewhere in GTA (I think). It's a great sharing dish, like most other Chinese dishes.  You see, the majority of the Chinese restaurants in the GTA are \"southern\" Chinese style, common for people from Hong Kong and southern areas of China. It's really refreshing to see something different.  We ordered one fish (Tilapia), oysters, and 2 small dishes. The oysters were awesome with the right amount of garlic taste. Fresh too! The fish tasted fresh. The small dishes were well made. We had glass noodle and chives. Both were spicy in a good way.   Prices are higher than your typical Chinese restaurant but worth it if you ask me."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously as we were craving for ?? ?grilled fish), but this place was seriously disappointing. Most of the food we ordered were supposed to be spicy. However, everything had a very sweet under-taste to it. Its as if they mistakened salt for sugar"}
{"text":"This is as authentic as traditional Chinese roast fish pot gets. Yes most of their dishes are spicy. yes it doesn't taste like other restaurants. Yes some dishes are \"Oily\". If you are not into AUTHENTIC SPICY Chinese cuisine, don't come. But if you do like things spicy, this place makes some of the best and most unique dishes representing \"Chuan\" and \"Xiang\" cooking disciplines."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I expected some decent food based on the price, but I was totally wrong. The boiled fish was stale and extremely salty. We asked for medium spicy but it was not spicy at all, and had heavy fishy smell. We wasted 80 dollar here and had some garbage. I will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is if the dish is dirty then they need to fix that. The beer cup they use are disgusting. Old plastic cups and sticky. The soup bowl they gave use are dirty too. The food is ok but you can get this everywhere."}
{"text":"Food is eatable but service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life. Save your money and time avoid this place"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. HOWEVER, when we got the bill it was $50 over what the menu had stated. We asked why and she said that the prices went up and they havent \"had time\" to change it. ***** please. Mainlanders."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  This is the second (new) location - the previous one was at Kennedy/McNicol.  Much easier to park here and same great food. The table cooking is great for multiple people and delicious.  You can customize the spice level to your needs (if you are a wuss - lol)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Do not come here. I've been here several times before, the food was okay. But now it's just horrible."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years. Food is delicious but a little expensive. Dishes are mostly spicy and salty but very tasty. The staff and service are hit or miss."}
{"text":"Like spicy Chinese food? You won't regret trying this place!   The dishes are very flavorful, especially the spicy grilled fish bathed in hot red sauce, so be prepared to down a couple bowls of rice with this meal.   My favorite dish is the spicy pig intestine, literally the most amazing accompaniment for rice. The fish is not bad either though it really is very oily, but like soak it up with rice or something because it really is worth it!   One things that's good and bad about this place is the use of those fire glass crystals that need to be replaced pretty often for the food to keep simmering. I mean it's cool and safe but when they get busy they either forget to replenish or they run out. Our waitress was near tears when we asked her to replace it for the third time. I'm sorry, we are not trying to bully you but our fish had been stewing for a good half hour and it's still not cooked? The fish meat ended up being very tough because the temperature wasn't right.   But anyways, still a very interesting place. Grab friends and go! It's filled with mostly large groups of young people so the atmosphere is loud and rowdy if you are into that kinda thing. Must be the spices getting everyone fired up. ;)"}
{"text":"W. B. Chinese Cooking is a great if you are into Hot and Spicy and table cooking.  Their famous tabletop cooking fish is good for groups at least I cannot eat that all by myself.  But there are also other options for tabletop cooking: Beef, Chicken, Pork Intestines,Shrimps and even Vegetables. All those are 2 chili spicy though and great for a cold winter days with beers! I ended up with the Grilled Cooked Chicken-Wok Cooked Foods ($9.99) with tons of spices and peppers! Hot and Spicy at the same time!  The lamb skewer ($1.50) was a disappointment. Not seasoned well and lack that fresh of the grill cook meat aroma. W B is definitely not a place for that!  The decoration is quite chic and modern. Love all the booth seating as they do provide a lot of privacy.  Waitresses are all so polite and soft spoken. She even came back and checked on me to see if I enjoyed my food.  My meal ended with a yogurt drink! I guess drinking that would help to neutralize all these spices?  10% off Grand Opening Special if pay by cash!  PS. no noodles... how come no noodles on the menu?"}
{"text":"Holy crab! If you're craving for crabs then come to visit! They have spicy crabs and grilled crabs, both are good! The restaurant was so considerate to provide free appetizer and yogurt X"}
{"text":"I'm like to write reviews after couple of times visit to the restaurants. I've been there for soft opening and two more times after that. I would give it a 4 stars on my first time of visit, but the 2nd time was so so, and third time I have to ask, how hard is it to keep up the standard.  The lamb skewer was my favourite and the reason for my re-visit. It was juice, evenly balance between the fat and the meat, and the bbq fat taste will liger in your mouth....hmmm. BUT on my third visit, the meat quality has gone down, and over cooked. Well, there specialty is the fish dishes, and I had been regular to the Scarborough location, this Makrham location, the only flavour you will taste is the saltiness. I can't taste the spiciness from the paper, and other fresh ingredients. Never been back since."}
{"text":"Don't come to this restaurant... It's such a waste of money plus the food isn't even considered good. I got the chicken wings and they weren't even cooked. The lamb meat was very hard to chew and it wasn't even hot when I got it.   This restaurant is a lie. They say the crawfish is fresh but when we asked the waiter he said it was frozen.    We also ordered the boiled fish. Very oily, salty, and it took at least 20 minutes to start boiling. The tofu was not fresh, it was sour.  Do not recommend."}
