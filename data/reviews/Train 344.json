{"text":"This trendy styled restaurant is located by the train station in Rosemere. It's quite big and has a patio with a fair number of tables. We were there on a Tuesday night in May and it was extremely quiet. There were only 2 other tables of diners which is a shame because people don't know what they are missing!
I ordered from the table d'hôte. I started with the green salad that was very tasty but a little too small of a portion. The flavors were so subtle but so good. I then had the risotto with lobster. I expected to get a few pieces of lobster but was surprised when i got half a lobster (still in its shell)! It was perfectly cooked and the pesto risotto was to die for. The portion size of the risotto made up for the comically small salad.
The food is top notch and the place itself is inviting. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I would have say that this is my favourite restaurant that I have ever been to.. Beautiful layout with amazing service. Love the fact that the wine menu is all private labels, and the food.. what can I say..? In one word.. Perfection! The flavours of every single dish that I have tried so far are on point! (I've been three times)I'm just going to go out and say it... \"It's like an orgy in my mouth!\""}
