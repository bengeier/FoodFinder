{"text":"I was greatly disappointed in the food I ordered here. The saddest part to it is I didn't have high expectations and was still unhappy. 
The potstickers were the absolute worst I've ever had! There's no hyperbole in that statement. They were inedible. They had a very thick hard dough. The meat itself was bland. I didn't finish one. The Lo Mein was pretty bleh as well. 
If the meal was just 'not good' I wouldn't have posted this. But when I couldn't eat most of it then yeah, I'm posting."}
{"text":"Wow! Great find. Had king p.o. lunch special with wonton soup.  Soup was delicious with three delicate dumplings reminiscent of Chinatown in Manhattan.  All food was served piping hot and everything was delicious. Hot bean paste was offered with the chicken so heat level could be adjusted to taste. The service was friendly and prompt.  Great experience. A must stop when arriving in Vegas"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Some of the best Chinese I've had in awhile to be honest. Close to work so I hit it up semi-regularly. Mongolian beef is on point!"}
{"text":"This used to be Kings Garden ever since I can remember my parents would bring us here to eat they had the best chinese food. It closed some years ago and was reopened by other owners and the food just wasn't right. Now China kitchen took over and I must say its not exactly the same, but its the best chinese food I have found in town since Kings Garden and that says alot."}
{"text":"My favorite of all Chinese food places. (I only have three and this one is farthest but worth it)
I come here and the lady at the front is so nice treats you like family. Large selection to choose from
 I like to eat in they bring your order to you in less then 7minutes! Good quality food for a great price. They also have lunch specials. Egg rolls are fresh not frozen like some places. Bona drinks are so good I tell them to put very little ice so I can enjoys it a little longer hahaha. Shrimps are bigger than any other food place!!! Can't even get shrimp this big at a steakhouse!!!! Fried rice is great and its making me want some so I will stop typing now. Lol"}
{"text":"There are only a few Chinese restaurants near my house. This one is not the closest but I don't like the food at the one that is closer. I ordered 4 different dinner specials for takeout and they were ready in about 15 or 20 minutes. Although the food is somewhat unremarkable, it was fairly good. I was not disappointed with anything in any of the meals (I tried a little of each). The place was clean and the people were friendly. I appreciated that the person who took the order spoke English well. The prices were reasonable. The only problem I had was with the packaging of the soup containers. Three of four lids broke and some soup spilled into the bag.

There is nothing to prevent me from ordering from here again. The food is what you would expect if your expectation is to get decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"So good.
The area is clean and tidy. The bathroom also clean.
The portion is big and wonton soup is delicious,  unlike other laces that usually rather bland .
Will comeback if in town."}
{"text":"Just ordered the pork noodles with fried rice ! My first time and this place is delicious!! And also you have to try corn egg drop soup !! Great place will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Thank God there's finally a delicious Chinese restaurant back in my neighborhood! I'm so happy I could scream, so happy I'm gonna YELP IT. You must try this restaurant. Their food is excellent. I've had the combo fryed rice, the beef chow fun, the Singapore rice noodle, the cashew chicken... everything was excellent! I can't stay away! YOU MUST EAT HERE, DONT MISS OUT! Oh ya they put so much meat in the food it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I like Boba drinks here,very tasty 
And food is very fresh and delicious
The restaurant is very clean, 
and service is nice 
I Will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Got a Mother-in-law U despise ... or cats U want to chase off?   If so, feed them from this place!  The fried shrimp was tiny, flattened, and rolled in what tasted like crumbs from the bottom of the toaster.   A couple of the pieces could have been used to patch truck tires!  Over half of the order went in the trash.
The fried rice HAD NO chicken, pork, shrimp! egg, veggies or anything resembling FLAVOR in it.  My sweet and sour pork was a handful of hard, dry, flavorless breaded lumps.  I was provided with a side of \"SWEET and ... well ... Red sauce.   It was SWEET, and did I mention RED?  It Tasted like colored sugar water.  Did I mention SWEET?
I don't know where the other reviewers ate.  I don't see how ANYONE could say this food was even edible, let alone \"delicious\"
NEVER EVER - EVER AGAIN!!!  EVER!"}
{"text":"After my regular Chinese restaurant closed, I have not found anything I like...... until today!  Wow! Great food, great prices!  We did pickup. We will for sure get food from here again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The combo fried rice used to be to die for, really loaded up with meats and treats.  Last visit it was really lacking.  10 bucks for rice.  Haven't been back in 8months. Close to home so likely to give another shot just because it's convenient"}
{"text":"First time getting food from this place. I ordered the combination fried rice. At first look seems like a good size portion for almost $10.00. Such a disappointment. nothing but rice info that plate."}
{"text":"My first time I had them they didn't disappoint at all. BOMB food and Chinese is my ultimate fav so they had high standards to meet lol love them!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!  I passed this restaurant lots of times, but had never eaten there. I stopped by Winchells to grab a donut and realized I hadn't eaten all day so I figured I would give it a try. I walked in and was looking at the menu at the front, when one of the workers walked around and handed me a paper menu and welcomed me :). I ordered cashew chicken dinner special to go which was around $8. Got home and ate and the food was DELICIOUS. No yucky aftertastes or overpowering. I will definitely be back with the outstanding food AND customer service. It's a win/win!!"}
{"text":"Good food,nice service ,first time here,I like salt pepper chicken wing,very tasty,I will be back every day."}
{"text":"Honestly this place doesnt look very inviting from outside, not a great neighbor but... food is great, always great. Great customer service, freindly and attentive... will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Las Vegas!!! I ordered the Lo me in with shrimp and the family dinner with double orange chicken. I got BBQ Pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls, to Rangoon's, and egg flower soup..great portions, and amazing taste!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars cause i think it the best in the area, never had an issue, we always call in and eat at home, i love the won tons but some times they are over done a little."}
{"text":"I have lived in the general area near this place for four years and never gave them a chance and I'm so glad I did. Their food is amazing and the coconut boba is perfect. Their delivery is always super quick and the food is always hot! I have zero complaints besides that I wish I would have tried them sooner. :)"}
{"text":"BBQ Fried rice is really good. Lots of BBQ pork in the rice and they give you a generous helping. Orange chicken is good and so are egg rolls. The egg rolls aren't really greasy which is nice. The plain fried rice that comes with the entre is kinda bland and are plain nothing in the rice, but the rices that have meat and veggies in them are very good. I got delivery and food was here in less than 30 minutes. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian Beef, Beef and Broccoli, and Sesame Chicken. The Mongolian Beef came with Fried Rice which was a surprised bc we didnt order the Fried Rice. It was great all the flavors ton of green onions green peppers it was just the way I like it. The Beef Broccoli was good too everything the served us was amazing. They also gave us on the house eggrolls w the sweet sauce and egg drop soup. The sesame chicken we took home bc their servings were really big. I will come again when I crave chinese food."}
{"text":"Not bad for what it is the lo mein was good and the rice was good the hot and sour soup had a weird green chili taste but I like initially so was also OK"}
{"text":"I live out of state and was just visiting Vegas.. Needed my Chinese food so I gave this place a shot and it was amazing! The girl working the cashier was so insanely nice & the food was amazing! Minus 1 star for the cold egg rolls but the rest was great! :) Plus, the food came out super fast which is unusual for a Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Good food ,friendly staff .I will be back to try again.I am from California,I come to visit my family here,first time try the food,it is delicious,I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese Food I've had yet. I ordered the Orange Chicken, and Chicken Low Mein and 2 Egg Rolls. The lady who took my order was an absolute sweetheart as was the delivery person. I'm definitely recommending this place to everyone I know. Everything from the food, to the delivery. Two happy thumbs up from a very happy customer."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall was super yummy with fresh. The staff was also very friendly I will come back with the rest of the Family."}
{"text":"This has gotten to be the worst Food I've ever ordered from anywhere. There is no flavor whatsoever adding salt just made it worse. Really got my hopes up. being 7 months pregnant and craving Chinese food. Very disappointing. On the upside delivery was very fast. That's the only good thing I can say."}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed hands a few times lately.  Food was always good but the new owners are awesome!!  Friendly and engaging.  The food is top notch.  Their new menu just came out and I've tried 3 entree items, ALL GOOD!!  They also have daily specials that are just as good.  I always pick up to to and my food is always ready on time and delicious when I get it home!!  Do not hesitate to order here!!  GREAT FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing, this place has been here for a while but now it's Under New Management. The staff is very welcoming and if you have any questions they're more than happy to explain anything for you my experience here was out of this world! I work for a 5 Star 5 Diamond Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip and the way they treated me was the way I would treat my guest at my hotel. I wanted to order a dish but it comes with shrimp I have an health issue with eating shrimp I placed my concern with the owner's daughter (she was taking my order) she spoke directly to the chef and it was no issue substituting it with something else. I say this because many Chinese restaurants do not like to substitute one thing for another I don't mind paying extra for something that I like. My experience here was unique and welcoming I'm very happy that I came now they have a loyal customer for a very long time and my family as well..."}
{"text":"Good food great people. Very very clean resturaunt . Large portions great prices . Try the fried calamari with some sriacha hot sauce . AWESOME !  $5.95 lunch specials every day . Lots of regular local customers eat here . Me too almost every day . There is a reason the place always busy . Everything on menu is good . Like curry spice ? Just tell them and they will put curry on it for you especially curry fried rice. They do local deliveries . Just try it . Oh, and try a frozen drink like a Slurpee ed a \"BoBa\" . Mocha coffee as well as fruit flavored ."}
{"text":"I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings. Off the chart good. The service was outstanding! Love this small kind place. Regular I will be."}
{"text":"First time coming here and won't be the last, the food was yummy and the service was great."}
{"text":"I used to have a favorite Chinese restaurant that I went to for years until it closed. For 20 years I haven't found anything even close until today. For a small restaurant it holds big powerful flavors. I just found my new heaven and can't wait to try everything on the menu. But the fried rice is to die for and this is just the plain one. Can't believe I have to wait to taste the combination fried rice. Something to look forward to. It's so inexpensive I can eat here 5 nights a week."}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for Americanized chinese food. I know that \"authentic ethnic food\" is all the rage now, but sometimes I just want the Chinese food I grew up with when this was a hick town. China Kitchen LV fits the bill. Another plus? China Kitchen won't put you in the hospital. I've seen so many Yelp pages on restaurants that have delicious looking food only to check them out in Dirty Dining or SNHD's restaurant page and be horrified by what they're doing in the kitchen. I can't tell you how many C grades or times a place has been shut down I found in a place that I wanted to try. Not here.

There's ample seating in the restaurant, it's very casual, but I think that it's mainly a luch and take out place. They've got a HUGE menu and it's all old-school \"haole\" chinese food. And it's all good too. The dishes give you plenty of meat and the vegetables are fresh. We had Beef Broccoli and Fried rice. The beef was filled with meat and the broccoli was cooked correctly, still firm and not mushy. The sauce was great. The fried rice is filled with peas and carrot and bits of fried egg. We had shrimp with ours and they give you plenty. In short, if you want exotic, adventurous food, go to a place that serves it. If you want the \"back east\" style americanized chinese food that many of us \"of a certain age\" grew up with, you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Only have eaten here once for lunch but mom and I both came away very impressed with the food we ate and the service was even better. The staff was extremely attentive to our needs even when our first server took his lunch break his replacement never missed a beat. now on to the food...

It was great. Everything was freshly prepared from the free egg rolls (right out of the oil, though they weren't the best part of the meal) to our lunch entrees and it was all prepared well. The chicken had no dark meat and more importantly none of the gristle and fat you usually get from cheaper Chinese food. The veggies were wonderfully fresh and cooked just past the point of al dente, still having all the flavor you want with that good sort of firm texture from nicely cooked vegetables. The sauces were also wonderfully flavorful without any overpowering flavors you find from a lot of Chinese quick food joints. The side of chow mein was even memorably good with a great garlicky taste, 100x better than anything panda has ever sold. 

It has been so hard to find good cheap Chinese since moving to Vegas China Kitchen LV is a relief to say the least. Can't wait to go back and really hoping the food is as consistently good as our first trip."}
{"text":"This location used to be known as KINGS GARDEN, which closed in 2014, then re-opened on March 9, 2015 under new ownership, with a new name.  I was their very first customer on Monday, March 9th.

The interior has been remodeled and looks very nice, but the food is now 100 times better than any Chinese cuisine I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm now over 65 years old.

I can certainly vouch for the quality of their Chicken Fried Rice, the Egg Rolls, the Egg Drop Soup, the Chicken Egg Foo Young and the Chicken with Vegetables.  Also, the prices are MORE than reasonable, considering the quality of the food and the size of the portions.

It is now under new \"ownership\" and managed by Windy Chen, who is originally from Beijing and is extremely customer service \"Oriented\" (forgive the awful pun, please!).  What you'll love most about her, is her welcoming smile and her desire to make your visit a truly memorable one.

They also have free WiFi!

China Kitchen LV is located on the NW corner of the Tropicana & Mountain Vista intersection, in the Vista Plaza Shopping Mall, and you'll probably see me there, a few times every week, simply because I'm crazy about terrific Chinese food.

PLEASE MAKE NOTE of their new hours, from 10 AM - 9 PM, every day of the week.  They are even open on XMAS DAY!"}
{"text":"It is great to have a Chinese restaurant on the east side of town. They offer inexpensive Chinese food and have fast service. Also if you're hankering for Chinese food and don't want to drive to the opposite side of town this is your best bet."}
{"text":"You can't beat the prices or quality here. $9.95 lunch specials and the portions are generous as well. I usually have enough left over for a second meal. The service is incredibly quick, too. I usually get my food within 5-10 minutes. 

It's a no-frills, authentic hole-in-the-wall place to eat and the space is quite clean. The staff is very attentive in picking up your plates and bringing you refills.

I come here every time I am craving Chinese food! My favorite is the Cashew Chicken with fried rice. However, the Kung Pao and Sweet and Sour Chicken are equally delicious. The egg rolls are always hot and fresh.

I highly recommend it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place had delicious, fresh-tasting Chinese food at a perfect price point. The boba smoothie was the perfect compliment to a fantastic meal. They were a little slow on service but apologized profusely and hurried our food as fast as they could. I'd go back here anytime!!"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas see my family here,first time eating here ,very good food and nice service,I will be back."}
{"text":"We came here with a big group expecting a traditional restaurant. It definitely isn't meant as a dine-in place. There are only 10 or so tables, ?and it was more of a \"hole in the wall\" than anything. We decided to give it a try anyway.

The menu was huge and had all the traditional items you expect (i.e., sweet and sour, general tsao's) as well as some more unique items like chicken curry. The prices were reasonable and the service was fast. 

While I wouldn't recommend this place for dining in, the food is good enough that I'll definitely be ordering take out in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious !!!!!! We had orange chicken and vegetables lo mein. Yummy and I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always take in consideration my food allergies proportions are really great we was always freshly-made fast service reasonable prices"}
{"text":"VERY SERIOUS HEALTH DANGER...

Let me start by saying that the food was delicious, and it arrived much sooner than they had quoted me.

All that aside, this place actually still uses MSG! I'll chock that up to my fault for not asking ahead, just assuming that, like my favorite places (in Michigan and across the country as I toured with various shows) had stopped using MSG years ago due to how many people get violently sick from it. And I know this because I called and asked; they confirmed they still use \"a little\". 

HOWEVER, I thought I would try to reheat my leftover Mongolian beef (not wanting to waste food, nor the $45 I spent on these meals; as well as to see if it really was the \"little\" MSG that rendered me so sick. Upon emptying my carton, I found a number of MUSHROOMS at the bottom. Unlike the MSG concern, *this* ALLERGY I was VERY SPECIFIC about when I ordered!

I am ABSOLUTELY BEYOND UPSET that their kitchen staff would be so cavalier about someone's health and safety! Seriously, this could have been a very dire situation. Luckily, not all mushrooms affect me the same; so, I never broke out in hives, nor had breathing problems as a result. BUT I VERY WELL +COULD* HAVE. 

Food allergies are nothing to mess with. If my request could not have been honored (which I don't know why that might be the case, I've never had issues elsewhere when making the request to not have a particular allergen in the dish), I should have been informed that I would need to make a different selection."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. It's just a little hole in the wall place, but it is excellent food. The service was very friendly, and the prices were great. I would definitely  recommend this place to anyone. They specialize in a lot of takeout food."}
{"text":"My son and I have no complaints about this place. He ordered the #2 Lunch Special - Chicken with cashew. I ordered #5 - Chicken with mushroom. Both were tasty and fresh. The egg rolls were hot and had been fried fresh, not some crap that had been sitting under a hot light for who-knows-how-long. Our drinks were refilled without having to ask, the girl just showed up. We both agree that we will go back. The total bill, including tip, came to just over $20."}
{"text":"Just ordered here for the first time with the family.  The portions were absolutely insane. We got so much food for a great price. The only thing I didn't like was that the cream cheese wontons tasted like old oil. They were super flavorless and just didn't taste good. I wouldn't recommend those. But everything else was great. And I'm very impressed with the price!"}
{"text":"The is my favorite Chinese spot, the food is ANAZING! Every time I go there they are always so nice to me even if I go in there just for some Thai Tea boba I always get awesome customer service. Their Thai Tea is so delicious, I'm obsessed! Every time I'm on that side of town if I don't get food I HAVE to get some Thai tea!"}
{"text":"We ordered Sweet and Sour Pork, Mushroom Chicken, Combo LoMein, Shrimp LoMein, Crab Rangoons, additional Eggrolls, and an appetizer sampler, of sorts.  While the flavors were good, everything seemed soggy and overdone.  

Unfortunately, we'd not likely order from them, again."}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place I was obsessed with the food! It's fresh and very flavorful. I always order to go and when I get home the food is piping hot. They messed up my to go order a couple of times which was a bad experience.  Food is good but make sure you check your food before you leave the Parking lot."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS 

  At China Kitchen, it is the Friendly service over the food that leaves a nice after taste. Recently, I was in the vicinity of Tropicana and Mountain Vista when it was time to erase a mental bookmark. 

   China Kitchen is so on the beaten path of Tropicana, yet hidden. China Kitchen stands at the northwest corner of Tropicana and Mountain Vista in the Cardena's Market and Q Mall anchored shopping center next to Winchells Donuts. When you are driving westbound on Tropicana or both directions, it is difficult to notice. The restaurant faces west. If it wasn't for typing in \"Chinese food\" on the Yelp search engine, I would be impervious to it. 

   According to a couple of Yelp reviews including my friend Scorpio, China Kitchen used to be a different Chinese restaurant. China Kitchen is relatively new. 

    Although it is in an older shopping mall where parking lots could be antiquated and challenging, parking here was a breeze. So was ordering. Off the lunch special menu, I ordered the shrimp lo mein which included fried rice and an egg roll. The price was $5.95. I'd order a fountain drink with that. A $5.95 lunch special with a Coke came to around $10. Hmm! Is a fountain beverage over $3. I have a hunch that they added a $1 for the shrimp based lo mein. The majority of the shrimp-based entrees were a $1 more. But it didn't say it on the menu for the shrimp-based lo mein. Anyhows onto the next paragraph. 

   China Kitchen is a hybrid of take out and restaurant. Preceding the meal, I ordered and paid. To the right of the counter, I filled up the stirophon cup with Coke. Then I chose a table. The man that I paid and ordered transitioned to the waiter. The dishes were not stirophon. 

    The lo mein was allright. It tasted like the chow mein soft noodles that China Go Go includes with the meals.  The shrimp was the wild card that made it all right. The fried rice and the egg roll were also good. 

    The service was great. I asked the waiter why I didn't get the soup. Apparently the soup is only included with dinner. However, the waiter went over and above good service by giving me a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup. The egg drop soup was yummy. Additional acts of kindness were when the owner voluntarily refilled my cup of Coke and when the woman representing China Kitchen asked me how my meal was and thanked me for visiting. 

    Kindness is contagious. The staff at China Kitchen's kindness caused a review written in a kind tone. Kind service is my kind of place. 3.5 STARS for a good lunch served with kindness."}
{"text":"My go to place for great Chinese food fast.  Love their dinner specials. The walnut shrimp is the best we have found in town. The staff is very friendly if you eat in and delivery is fast and the food is still hot when it arrives at our house."}
{"text":"Great little place. If you drive by it? You probably wouldn't stop. But the food is great!! Best combination fried rice ever!! And all the staff are super nice. Great hole in the wall. I get the combo fried rice with hot garlic shrimp and pour the shrimp and all the goodness over the rice. It's amazing"}
{"text":"Pros: FAST!!! Fairly good selection of choices, your standard Chinese place. Conveniently located, service was friendly.

Cons: The food was Meh. Nothing to write home about. Most places give you enough food to take home for the price. I also HATED the brown rice but they try to pass it off as fried rice."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall hidden gem found in the outskirts of Las Vegas. The food was excellent and very affordable, which was a nice change from the inflated prices of everything on the Vegas strip. Customer service was great, and plenty of parking! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Fabulous service. Lots of choices. Friendly employees. Not much seating.  Great for take out"}
{"text":"I love this place and order quite often. Everyone is always so incredibly nice. This is kind of petty, but I didn't get any sweet and sour sauce with my delivery. I am an incredibly picky eater and now I don't want to eat my 30 dollars worth of food. :("}
{"text":"Husband found this place because our regular Chinese spot closed down. This is a gem come true. Cashier already knows us and our order. She is the sweetest. The food is always fresh. They are very attentive with dine in and take out. Very quick to serve. Recommend."}
{"text":"I can't say that this is the BEST Chinese food that I've ever had, it's ok. This place is super close to my house so I figured I'd give it a shot. I ordered the same thing that I get from our normal spot to make a fair comparison. The egg foo young was pretty good but the \"gravy\" was more of a soy sauce gravy, and was a little different, good, but different, then what I know egg foo yung to be. The sauces for the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken were actually too sweet. Disappointing because the beef was actually pretty tender, and I don't normally eat beef anything in Chinese food because the beef always seems overcooked, and chewy. I'd say my least favorite was the fried shrimp.. It was on par with what I'd get at a bar, not a Chinese food place. In all not a bad place, just not what I was expecting with two reviews claiming this place to be the best Chinese food of their life."}
{"text":"finally found some good takeout! husband got chicken wings and loved them, the combo lo mein had great flavor! the star of the show was the coconut bona drink! sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Good food, loved it
I ordered a delivery service
food was fast and hot when it was delivered and very delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome beef w/broccoli and sweet sour chicken!!!My new Chinese  restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Vegas. We drive from Summerlin and probably pass 15 Chinese restaurants on the way there. Cant beat the portions or prices.  I've easily ate at 10 different Chinese places since living here and this is hands down the best... Egg drop soup, egg rolls, and numerous entrees are best I've had."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and mixed veggie lunch special. It was hot and smelled delicious but when I tasted the chicken... I was disappointed. Maybe it was just that item? I don't know but I might give them another try."}
{"text":"I've been coming here often, like the good food. Like the service with a smile. Fast food pricing is great as they have daily lunch specials from 11am-3pm. I've never had a bad meal here. I will continue to visit this location."}
{"text":"Best chinese food I had here . They always make my tofu anyway i want. Im vegetarian so they made it easy for me to order  definitely going back soon !"}
{"text":"Excellent service reasonable price I highly recommend The combination fried rice and the General tso chicken"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten in my entire life! If I could give it a zero star review I would, one star is way too good for this place! This is not Chinese food, this is the cheapest imitation of Chinese food you could ever get. I didn't think anyone could ever mess up Chinese food but these people dead! The eggroll is from Target stores, I know because I bought it when my boyfriend cooked way better Chinese food then these people can ever even dream of. And he paid $10.01 for it for some store-bought eggrolls and the worst disgusting beef I've ever seen, this doesn't even look like beef, it looks like fat put together through a machine and called beef. Keep away from this place! Take the drive and go to Chinatown and get some authentic Chinese food from there!"}
{"text":"BEST noodles in town! The food is great. I love this place. Eat here like once or twice a month. The employees are super friendly. And the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"The rice was good. The soup had an odd chemical taste, so tossed that out. The buddah delight was not delightful, but really mushy. Live and learn. Although the people were nice and the order correct, I'm just gonna keep looking."}
{"text":"I came to this place several years ago, when it was under a different owner. (Kings Garden) The distinct similarities of the restaurant remains intact. Food is so so. Not much to praise on. I've heard from other folks that came here that the way the food is prepared is entirely based on the available chef that is cooking on that day. Curry chicken is ample with the sauce. Kung pao chicken lacks the appropriate meat to cut veggies ratio. Generous portions. All in all, the customer service was absolutely fantastic and welcoming."}
{"text":"Super friendly, good prices and good food. Chicken is good quality. Egg rolls and nice and greasy and their hot and sour soup is the best. We have both eaten in and gotten take out. Both were good experiences. Quick, good service and yummy food. We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic  Chinese Food! We love the Mongolian Beef, Combination Lo Mein, & Cream Cheese Wonton. I always order food in this restaurant not only tbe food but fast delivery and for pick ups they will call you as soon as the food is ready mine was just 5 mins after I ordered online."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food. Not gourmet or anything but its a good hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place. We definitely recommend this restaurant. Best Chinese food we've had. The service is great. Wendy and Carlos are good at what they do. Always attentive and very helpful.  The service they provide makes us want to come back. In fact, we visit once a week. The food is very delicious.  Overall a great experience."}
