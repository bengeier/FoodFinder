{"text":"I think anytime a new chain moves into the market customers get all excited because it's new and different. I've eaten here 3 times and each time have spent 1hr waiting in line for breakfast. I have felt rushed to be pushed through with my breakfast to turn over the table to other customers waiting in line for my table. I find the breakfasts are filled with fruit while I like eggs, pancakes & bacon for breakfast. I think they put too much fancy cut up fruits on your plate. The menu has a lot of choice but it seems like they're just rearranged in different formats. The waitresses seem overworked and pushed to get customers through and turnover tables. Had to wait and ask for service such as extra napkins & water."}
{"text":"there was an ELASTIC BAND in my omelette. they told me it was the elastic band was from wrapping the broccoli? Thats a terrible excuse. I was chewing on a ELASTIC BAND. Disgusting!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited at the door forever, watched my food sit on the warmer forever, waited for coffee refill forever and then for the bill! Wasn't very busy and they don't have their priorities straight. Service sucks at this location!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here twice for breakfast during our trip to Toronto and we really enjoyed it. The food was a hundred times better than the free breakfast being offered at our hotel . I've never seen a restaurant serve so much fresh fruit before.    Both times we went the staff was great but I wouldn't come here if you are in a big rush.  If you have time to eat and relax, I definitely recommend it. The crowd really picks up after 9pm so go as early as you can."}
{"text":"Informed my server of my dietary restrictions (dairy) and requested that my eggs not be made with milk.  They were and I had an allergic reaction.  Will never visit Cora's again as a result"}
{"text":"Not a winner. Ordered what I call a regular breakfast...bacon, eggs etc. Sadly disappointed.  There were no long lines, this day, the place is notorious for. Upon entering, the greeter was scripted as was our waiter. Coffee arrived and it was weak and lukewarm.  The food. More attention is paid to how it is placed (artistically?) on the plate. I have never seen bacon so thin and sparse (shaved?) The so-called sausage tasted terrible and could have passed for a hot dog. The eggs were small but cooked as ordered. All arrived lukewarm. When I asked for extra napkins, I got a scowl  and small diner napkins. Coffee refills you had to beg for.  This chain \"concept\" is tired. It has all of the appearances of financially struggling and trying to cut many corners in the process. The bother to worth to food ratio just doesn't isn't there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday just before lunch time. It looked like there were only 2 servers working which could account for the slightly slow service but our server was very nice and welcoming.  I had the Mountain of Fresh Fruit Waffle. The custard they put on it was better than expected - it was light and refreshing. My mom had the Brunch Burger from the kids/teen menu. It was difficult to eat as it came apart very easily. Overall, both orders were nothing special other than being expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"The food is fine.  Its the service that is the issue here.   Its unbelievably slow! There are quite a few other breakfast options in Newmarket with just as good food as here."}
{"text":"Good food, but man what a wait.  The food is fairly similar to other places we've eaten, so nothing special there.  The only thing that I was surprised at was the amount of fruit you got on the plate.  Which probably accounts for a good portion of the cost.  If it was less busy (ala more than one in the city) I would probably like it more.  Great for breakfast, but would probably choose somewhere smaller and quieter most weekends."}
{"text":"Cora's is a great place to go if you desire a breakfast full of fresh fruit. I had the 'Mountain of Fresh Fruit' breakfast waffle and it was absolutely amazing. The custard tastes great and the fruit was very fresh. I also had a fruit breakfast smoothie which was good. In terms of the other breakfast items, my partner had the 'Rosemary's Sunday' dish which was a standard dish of eggs, bacon, and potato, nothing spectacular but it wasn't overly greasy/oily which we appreciated. I will definitely go back to Coras to try more fruit dishes."}
{"text":"Oh my fav place for breakfast. Yes i have stood 30 min in line to get in at the T.DOT location. Yummiest breakfast options and great for kids. i never think twice to tip generously their excellent client servincing"}
{"text":"Popular restaurant. Service is bad and slow. Food is good. Price is expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food...terrible service which is understandable given how packed this place is almost every day of the week."}
{"text":"They are generous with the amount of fruits they put on the waffles I ordered....n I love fresh fruits so that's what I will go back to Cora's for....also the tea was lovely and I loved the fact they keep asking for refills.."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Hostess was rude, waitress was nice; however not really accommodating.  Food was awful. Pancakes were dry, fruit did not taste fresh. Waitress said the orange juice was made a few days ago....:|   Oatmeal was not bad, a little runny.   I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast. There are so many other better options around the area."}
{"text":"Cora's was a big disappointment for me. I had heard nothing but good things, but sadly it doesn't live up to the hype. I had breakfast here with my fiancé and was really looking forward to it. The long lines show just how popular this place is. Fortunately, the line moved quickly. While the service was decent, the food was not. The food at Cora's is on par with Denny's except with lots of fresh fruit. I had eggs benedict with asparagus & Swiss cheese and my fiancé had a western omelette. While she enjoyed her omelette, I found my eggs benny to be cold and flavourless. The fruit was okay. With so many good breakfast places to choose from, I won't be returning to Cora's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst brunhc experience ever!  Arrived at 11:30am.  We waited for about 5 minutes for our table of 4 but I warn you, the wait could get up to 30-45 minutes if you happen to be in the rush.  The area we were seated was super tight, chair budding chair and practically sitting up the table.  It took about 10 minutes after we sat down before someone came to take our order.  We ordered beverages first and it took the waitress 10 minutes to bring us our coffees.  The latte I ordered was spilled all over the saucer, totally messy.  Finally when it came time to put in our food order, the waitress was so rushy, she totally had no manners treating us patrons!  The food came exactly 30 minutes later, 30 MINUTES for 1 order of omelette, 1 order of breakfast burrito and 1 order of regular eggs/bacon/hash?  The food was mediocre and small.  Quality vs. value was off.  No one came with free coffee refills.  Its a loud restaurant but more exciting things were the breaking dishes, MULTIPLE times.  After paying, we only put down 10% tips because of the horrible service and the waitress had the guts to glare at us!  I could've been totally mean and leave her no tips!  Cora's you just lost yourself 4 customers."}
{"text":"Pretty busy on the weekends- I went wanting big fluffy pancakes- but they don't have that. Food was fresh just not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Big choice of breakfasts, tasty, but too much croud, lots of people! Not so comfortable to sit there with family."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I have been going there at least once a week with my Team and spend over $100 per lunch. Every time we go, there is always something wrong with my orders. No egg whites when asked, added cheese when asked not to etc...it's always something! Yesterday, the owner actually charged me for the omelette that they screwed up. I didn't want another one since last time it took forever to get a replacement. I said to the server that I was surprised they charged me for the omelette and she said that she asked the owner and he told her to charge me. That being said, slow service, always making mistakes in the kitchen and the owners are rude and lack accountability. They just lost a $100/week bill over a $12 omelette! Great way to run your business. I am writing this as I sit at Sunset Grill with my Team ordering lunch!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at Cora's! I've been here a few times for breakfast, and they have so many amazing dishes. Their eggs florentine, omelets and crepes are their best dishes. There all big portions, making it an excellent place for brunch too !  Another thing that i love about cora`s is the smoothies. There service is great, its fast and the staff is really helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon englishmuffin with hollandaise it was pretty good b I didn't like the fact the fruits were on the same plate and it mixed with the sauce therefore I didn't really get enjoy the fruits. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Bland bland food- it's just tasteless. And their fruit is usually crunchy, not ripe and delicious as one would expect for the price. Don't even get me started on the sausages.... they're gross!"}
{"text":"I have been to the other coras locations in Vaughan and Newmarket and they are great as well, however, this location in particular had exceptional service. The food was perfect as well and the staff are very friendly. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I was impressed with the amount of fresh fruit and the freshness of the fruit but other than that the food was very plain. They had a gluten free menu and gluten free toast which is a bonus. It was very expensive (probably to cover the cost of having fresh fruit) and it was not especially tasty. The bacon was thin and tasteless. Potatoes are good (grilled, not deep fried) and nothing is extremely greasy which is a bonus. The plate looks impressive as they cut and place the fruit in nice looking arrangements however they should focus more on the quality of the food instead of the presentation. Most expensive breakfast for 2 that i have ever had."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Cora's yesterday...no air-conditioning...we were sweltering...waited 40 mins for our over priced food..."}
{"text":"First visit to cora's was earlier this week on new year's day. Of course the restaurant was busy and lack of staffs.  We have to wait outside tge restaurant ans there were a lot of people waiting. If they managed the check -in and seating better, it would be a lot better.   Well,  it was new year's day. Can't blame them.   We were a group of 7,  6 out of 7 ordered Cora special including me. It was great. We were super hungry.   The meal came earlier than i thought, and it was very warm.   Our server was nice but too busy to come back for more coffee.   Will check cora other location in the future.  Just for food though."}
{"text":"The cutlery and plates were too dirty and nasty for my liking. I would not come here again as their price does not match their service. Forks and knives were dirty, as well as their plates that they served my dish in."}
{"text":"The female washroom has 2 stalls, 1 was clogged and the other one was over flowing! It smelled like someone had got really sick. Let the manager know & he said okay...he did nothing about it. He continued to seat people and take payments for the rest of the 30 minutes we were there. Gross!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place, as long as you're ordering an omelette. Decided to switch it up and try the eggs Benedict. They did not hold back on the hollandaise sauce, which made everything taste extremely salty. It very easily got into my fruit as well. But service was great. Coffee cup was never empty. Server was pleasant. I'll definitely go back but will not be ordering the eggs Benedict ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to many Cora's franchise locations and this one seems to be the most underwhelming.  The service here, while friendly, tends to be extremely slow.  Like all locations, don't be too late or you'll be stuck in a ridiculous lineup - I have a really hard time justifying a wait for eggs, honestly!!"}
{"text":"I found a beetle in my potatoes! And the manager didnt even pay for our meal! I will never return."}
{"text":"Can I give negative stars?? Hands down worst breakfast place ever. I'm sorry, but you could do better in a soup kitchen. Service is bad and scatter brained. Servers aren't trained and overwhelmed. I don't usually mind that especially if the food could make up for it.. but I make better bacon and I'm an awful cook! Waste your money somewhere else"}
{"text":"I have a mix opinion about this restaurant. The first time I went there, I had a decent experience, but the mix fruit smoothie was very bad. My buddy and I were unable to finish it. The second time I went was a terrible experience. Bottom line, the egg tasted very funny, and the employees were very rude and judgemental. I'm never going there again."}
{"text":"Normally love this place except I barely got a refill of tea, and I had hair on my plate. Service was so slow I didn't even bother complaining, I just stopped eating. What a shame that was! Not worth the $20."}
{"text":"They execute breakfast better than anyone else I have found in the vicinity.  Wait time to get seated can be long depending on what time you arrive. At least that is what I experience on the weekends when I normally go here. Parking is free.  Also, this is a great place to celebrate a birthday since the staff sings and hands out a mini fruit sculpture dessert to the birthday boy or girl."}
{"text":"Cora's is my go-to breakfast joint but this location is terrible. Granted it's Saturday morning and Easter weekend but it should be the responsibility of the owners to properly staff their establishment for such occasions.   I'm writing this review as I'm sitting in the restaurant without my food because apparently the kitchen lost my order ticket. I am here with 4 kids and it took 40 minutes for them to get their breakfast.   Our server took 10 minutes to finally take our order and then she left us to our own devices. She brought our drinks about 7 minutes later and then disappeared again. 40 minutes later food finally arrived but not my breakfast. Almost an hour later I finally have my breakfast, it has literally just arrived. However, there wasn't a single apology or an ounce of sincerity from my server. She just placed my plate down and that was it.   I asked to speak to the manager and he was very nice and apologetic. I just told him what happened and he agrees that waiting for that long was unacceptable especially with 4 kids in tow. He adjusted the bill and took my meal off.   I come back here again but I hope I don't get the same server."}
{"text":"As an alternate to Sunset Grill I like to go to Cora's sometimes. Cora's is a Montreal franchise that has a wide variety of menu items that go beyond the traditional diner breakfast fare of a Denny's.   Many places don't have crepes, but Cora's does and they're quite good. Their bacon, while usually delicious, is quite thin. I've also had the blueberry pancakes, meat skillet, banana and nutella crepe, raspberry pancakes, and other items.   My only complaint is that the prices are very high. 3 pancakes, while filling, will run you north of $10-11. Even the smallest complete breakfast is $11."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday morning May 17, 2017 around 10:30 my mother and I hadn't been in in awhile as we moved out of the area, my mother had just had dental surgery so she was very limited to what she could eat, The waitress a nice blonde lady was extremely kind and helped my mother choose the right thing (soft) as chewing was limited... The service I must say was impecable probably the best I have had at this location. We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place in Mississauga!  I really like Cora's Breakfast.  This is one of the first breakfast places that I went to where you get served a mountain of fresh fruit with just about anything you order on the menu.  I recommend the Eggs Ben et Dictine and the Crêpomelette, but everything's good that I've tried on the menu.  I have never eaten lunch here, I always get the breakfasts.  About my only complaint about Cora's is that it isn't open later!  I guess the prices could be a wee bit lower, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Love the cora menu but this location has horrible service. Don't know if the waitress was having an off day but we got horrible service. To add to that the food was off too. I've been to a few different Cora's locations and hands down this was the worst experience I've ever had. Usually their service is on point just like their food. Always a smiling face and regular check ins on the table. None of that here."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions and mediocre breakfast food. Save some money and make your own breakfast at home. You'll probably enjoy it more than the food they serve here."}
{"text":"very generous and good variety of fruits served with french toast cinnabun.  Not bad. Not worth lining up for though.  Solid meal and good sized portions."}
{"text":"Went here this morning!  The line looked super long, but we were seated promptly.  The waiter we had was super friendly and it made eating there a nicer experience.  I got the 1990's harvest.  The cinnamon brioche with an egg, bacon and a pile of fresh fruit on the side.  Very delicious!  My bf got the ham and swiss omelet with added spinach.  Very filling and I didn't feel groggy or sluggish after eating it.  I love going to get breakfast, especially on days when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have eaten here a couple times this year and I can honestly say I'm not impressed. My wife feels we can make better pancakes at home. Both times I ate here I found the service was scarce, the food very greasy, undercooked and luke warm. Honestly, I could get better food at Denny's. I think I'll go there next time instead."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very friendly, clean and good portion. Will definitely come here again :)!"}
{"text":"Went here today for brunch with my boyfriend for the first time, and someone had locked the front door (even though it was 10 AM and clearly open), so we couldn't get in. Once we were in we were seated immediately. The food itself tasted good and came in huge portion sizes (a crepe could feed two). However, there was a couple a few booths down that was hardcore making out, which was really unappetizing and distracting. Staff saw this occurring and said nothing to them, which was a bit more upsetting. In addition, there was a staff member (waitress maybe? She had long blonde hair, older) who was eating food through the pass through window where the cooks put the food out. I'm not sure if she was eating guests food or a snack of her own, but staff should never be eating like this in front of guests. At least find a seat in the back to take a snack break. The prices were high ($13 or so for a crepe) and I don't think I'd choose to come back here again."}
{"text":"Today is my daughter's 13th birthday and we bought four of her friends out for breakfast after a sleepover last night.  The waitress noticed the \"birthday girl\" pin that my daughter was wearing and brought her a special birthday smoothie, complete with a carved apple in the shape of a bird...without my even having to ask. The service was truly excellent and the food was amazing. We will be back again for sure!!!  I highly recommend Cora's."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast franchises I've been to.  They serve until 3pm.  Any Cora's you walk into, you'll find yourself surrounded by fruits.  Every dish you order comes with fruit.    This specific location is small.  The setup isn't so great.  Order your food, and pay at the front (which is literally right by the exit door).  This can cause serious line up problems and block peoples paths either  wanting to leave or getting up to go to the restroom.   The food is good.  A lot better than Denny's, that's for sure.   Service is a-ok.  I bet the service would be better if the staff were actually able to manoeuvre around, rather then trying to get by people.  If you plan on coming here, be prepared to line up.  If you pre-order for pickup, you need to be sneaky when theirs a line up to get inside.  Once someone leaves, use that exit to go in, and if you're smooth, you may actually be able to cut to the front of the line up (considering the pay desk is right by the exit), pay for your pickup and bounce!  I would've given 4* if this place had a better setup."}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to give any place less then 3 stars, but that just shows that something is quite lacking at this Cora's location. We stopped by on a sunday late morning being in the neighbourhood, thinking we would be in and out within 30-40mins. Unfortunately for us, we were quite mistaken.  Walking into the restaurant you could see several empty tables, however the line up was so long that people were queued outside. The waitress was moving at a pace you would expect at a slow, empty restaurant, not a bustling, noisy one like this place!   When we finally were seated, nobody came by our table for 15 minutes. Finally, after seeing our quite obvious discomfort, a busy waiter came by and told us that it would be another 5 minutes. We eventually did order, but any enjoyment of the food was ruined by the sluggishly slow experience.   I will not be returning to this location again, unless forced."}
{"text":"Very slow. Even when it's not busy. We were waiting over an hour! Avoid."}
{"text":"After watching a segment on CBC's Fortune Hunter's about the success story of Chez Cora, I just had to go and try out their food.    Let me start by saying that the wait was long... I went there extra early (8:30 am) in hopes of avoiding the crowd but did not succeed.   The restaurant is definitely family friendly with plenty of dishes to choose from.    Overall I was happy with their food and excited over heaps of fresh fruit but somewhat disappointed with the coffee and the juice.     As for the value , expect to spend at least $ 20 per person for a main dish and a drink.  Also, if you happen to pick the weekend brunch hour, you may have to be patient with their slow kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  The food is not even fresh!  And everything is greasyI didn't think you could mess up breakfast, but this place does."}
{"text":"Absolutely poor. Toast was buttered when I asked for not, the bacon was plastic, the sausage was almost inedible, the \"home fries\" were maybe put in a microwave in a bowl of oil, thrown on a grill and served.... disgusting. No concession on the bill, sad."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict are wonderful.  The hollandaise sauce were rich and creamy. Make sure to ask for caramelized onions on top of the roasted potato wedges. You'll thank me later. This meal alone is 780 calories but well worth it."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chains but this Cora's is definitely an exception. Tried a few around the GTA and have to say best experience by far...friendly staff, yummy food and very accommodating. Never been disappointed with my visits here. The menu is standard for all Cora's but the food at this location is always tastier. Plus, love the add-on options...like fried onions with the home fries which was first suggested by a server here. The Etobicoke location had an issue with providing a booth (though there were many empty), stating they were for larger parties...never an issue here though. The only -ve is the long line at times...but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite breakfast place with my friends and family but since they've changed owners the service is poor, rushed, and rude.  The gentleman that I presume is the new owner doesn't know a thing about customer service,  speaks in chinese,  and runs the place like a chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Always plently of room when I came to this Cora's. Service has always been exceptional and my water glass never went empty. The portions are pretty big and I usually need to take the rest to go. The always make the plating of the food really decorative which is always a bonus. Dont forget to treat yourself to a bite sized treat which they have at the checkout."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here last Sunday and we find it a nice place to eat, good service and nice foods"}
{"text":"Came today on New Year's Day. Waited for a while to be seated and then placed our order. We waited an hour and 10 minutes before finally receiving our food. Which was incorrect in order as well. Definitely not a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. But they need to attend to their washroom because there was a strong urine odor from the washrooms. Kind of ruins the experience. Had to move tables but there was still a faint smell."}
{"text":"Not really impressed and will not return. Wanted an omelet but can't have a few items due to diet that were listed. I was told everything was Pre mixed and couldn't make any changes. So I ordered eggs benny and was dissapointed again. Hollandaise is horrible. Ordered eggs poached medium came hard. We were then asked how our eggs were cooked and we both said they were way over done (gf ordered benny poached medium as well) and we kind of got a shrug of the shoulder and that was that. Yes we could have returned them but we didnt  want to wait again as we had an appt to get too and waited a bit already. Def will not be back."}
{"text":"This location provided the very best service we have ever received at any Cora's Breakfast & Lunch location we have dined at. It could have only been because of the server \"Paula\" we had, as I am sure there are other servers at this location who probably are not as good as Paula. Cora's 1881 Steeles Avenue West. (416)665-0201. Server: Paula, Table: 34, Bill# 97, 2016-11-26, 11:28:10. We ordered regular coffee, Ben Ham (2), and Jo Construction. I work downtown as a Sous Chef for Oliver & Bonnaccini, my girlfriend works as a Full-Time Youth Pastor. I was very impressed with my service from Paula and for the most part, the food received. We visit Cora's for brunch at least 3 to 5 times a month, unfortunately, this location is a bit out of our way considering I live at Kennedy & Sheppard and she lives in Markham. We have eaten at this location before once or twice, but every other time we have been here, the lineup has been too big and we were in a hurry. This is the only location who has ever asked me if I wanted the fruit or tomato garnish with my Jo construction, I was very impressed because other Cora's never give me that option and NEVER have the piece of lettuce. The other locations always tell me that Cora's Brands NEVER carry the lettuce, it is only on the picture of the menu for show! At this location at Dufferin and Steeles, I was so happy to see the piece of lettuce. Paula also brought extra serviettes to each and every table she had which showed that she is a VERY organized server. I ate some bad ham at another location in Markham, it was on the acidic side, and no, it was NOT the Hollandaise Sauce! I know, because I am a Chef. At the Markham location, the cook didn't drain all the water from the poached egg which resulted in soaked ham and soaked english muffin. This showed that cooks have no passion at the Markham location. Today at 1881 Dufferin location, there was no excess water from the poached egg, the ham was fresh and my english muffin stayed firm and crunchy. The ONLY thing I would say about the food I received would that the tomatoes were not so fresh, seemed like they were either frozen at one point or either they were not kept at the certified cold temp, even though the kitchen is hot at all times, there is no reason why the tomatoes cannot be kept at the certified cold temps. If you are using the inserts with the \"certified cold-lines\" (this is the line just below the rim of the insert) then this should not be a problem even for new cooks just learning. In detail, there is a line inside a plastic or metal insert which is about an inch to inch 1/2 under the top rim, that is the certified cold line. Nothing sitting in a cold table should exceed that line, or else you are not keeping that food certified cold! Other than that, I was extremely impressed. At the end of our meal, I made eye contact with I believe to be the owner, I nodded at him, and he actually nodded back, but not in a forced manner, but in a genuine pleasant and thanking manner. He looked at me as a good customer, not as if I was just a \"Paid Bill\". Way to Go cooks of Cora's 1881 Steeles Avenue West, Way to Go Paula our server who was very professional. And to the owner, I am sure you get stressed out at times, I am sure you think about money, you wouldn't be a good businessman if you didn't think about your money, but thank you for genuine thank-you and you are doing an awesome job! Keep it up and we will see you again. I am the one who \"wears the pants\" in our relationship. I have been blessed to have such a humbled and submissive girlfriend and if I don't like something or someone, my girlfriend agrees with everything I say. It is my opinion that counts the biggest! So that means we will be eating here more often."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!! The choices are so interesting, the portions are huge and everything looks and tastes so amazing.   Checkout their menu online and you can see all the super delicious and interesting menu items they have. I continually get the Eggs Benedict with spinach which is absolutely amazing. All their dishes come with a medium to large side serving of fresh fruit that is cut in cute shapes. I've also had their crepes which are insanely good but HUGE. And for an amazing hangover/couple different menu options, go for the omelette in a crepe, they make a super delicious crepe, roll in it a thin omelette, cheese, sometimes veggies and they give you an amazing sauce on top. It's such a delicious-doughy-highCal hangover or craving option.  I've eaten at both this and the Dufferin-Steeles location and the service is better at the Dufferin-Steeles location. We went early Sat morning and they were busy but the waitresses were all in some sort of mood."}
{"text":"We love this place for brunch and breakfast foods! All their breakfast plates come with super fresh fruit and a great variety. Their eggs Benedict is fantastic and so our their breakfast Crepes!   They are always busy but never packed (except Sunday from 10-12) so we never have an issue getting a table and the service is always fantastic. They are attentive and never let our water glass get empty."}
{"text":"Popped by Cora's for an impromptu breakfast after a late night.  Ordered a variety of things, and I didn't mind the food.  It was all good actually.  The coffee was, as expected, diner coffee.  Nothing to write home about.  The prices are waaaay too high for breakfast food.  Breakfast should be one of the more inexpensive foods, and for three people we spent around $60.  For breakfast?  There wasn't anything special with the food that could possibly warrant that price for breakfast.  That said, Cora's has never been my go to location for breakfast, and I probably won't go again anytime soon.  With a city full of amazing breakfast places, I don't think Cora's is my first choice."}
{"text":"Meh... Ridiculously overpriced bland breakfast. I had the Greek omelette...it was a disappointment ..."}
{"text":"Keep Searching!  I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the line up out the door. Unfortunately it was just slow service, there were plenty of empty tables. Menu items were limited - how many ways can you serve an omelet & a crepe. Both our meals were served cold especially the hashbrowns. The crepe lacked seasoning other than under cooked onions. Don't expect a refill on your coffee."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever at HWY7&WARDEN.  The Owner-Franchisee \"Wincy Pang\" was very rude to my family and not willing to fulfill the company's advertised promotion and another owner \"James Pang\" said \"What the FXXK\" to my family and asked us to \"Pay and Get of Out Here\".  DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.  Here is what happened: My family (two adults, one 2 1/2 year old and one 1 year old) went to the Cora at HWY7&WARDEN today at around 2PM. We were served by a person called Ryan and we showed the free cocktail promotion with $8+ meal purchase per customer per visit from Cora's facebook site. He confirmed that we would get three free cocktails with three $8+ meals ordered, so we ordered three meals (each is around $12+) and three free cocktails. At the checkout time, Ryan showed us the bill and we found that there was only one cocktail was rebated. We inquired on that and he talked to his manager \"Wincy Pang\". Wincy Pang came and insisted not giving, and told us that this promotion was only given to each customer who had Cora app registered. We told her that, however, this promotion was from Cora's facebook site without need to logon or signup for anything. She then offered to give us 2 free cocktails instead of 3, but we insisted that all three should be free since it was from the promotion and we confirmed with Ryan before ordering. She said she had to break them into separated bills in order to do that, and we said \"that is fine, just break the bill into three\". She then said \"Come on Guys\" and shake her head. I asked her \"what did you mean by what you just said and acted?  It is in the promotion fine print that is per customer per visit, and we have 4 customers in total. Your company should not be advertising the promotion if it cannot be fulfilled.\". At this time, a person called \"James Pang\" came to our table, slapped the table and said \"What the FXXK do you want\" to us.  He also asked us to \"JUST PAY AND GET OUT OF HERE\". We argued with him and Wincy what kind of customer services they were providing to customers and even swore to customers with little kids around. We asked them to credit back the drinks and we would just pay the meals.  They finally did it with 3 separated bills. We paid and said would complain to the head office and let everyone know and Wincy said please go ahead. Please also note that we had really hard time getting James name. We asked many times and Wincy insisted not to say his name until James came over and said very loud that \"My name is JAMES PANG, go ahead and complain about me\"  This is really a crazy restaurant - I have never experienced in person or seeing other customers being swore and treated like this.  This location should be CLOSED DOWN."}
{"text":"My first experience here was rather pleasant other than the ridiculous long line up. This time we called ahead and asked if there was a line up since we were super hungry and not in the mood to wait. We were told there was not a single person in line and after a 5 minute drive and upon entering the restaurant there was about 10 people ahead of us. I doubt this line developed within 5 minutes but it is possible.   Anyways, me and my fiance ordered the egg benedict with asparagus and swiss cheese. (same thing I had ordered last time, my fiance had ordered pancakes previously). It didn't taste as good this time probably a 7/10 (only bc the presentation and variety on the plate boosted it's rating).   THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!!!!!  VEGETARIANS, HALAL EATERS, MUSLIMS, NON-PORK EATERS or KOSHER EATERS THIS IS FOR YOU!!  To our horror my fiance found BACON on his plate mixed up with the french fries. It could have very easily been passed off as french fries bc there were tiny burnt potato pieces.   our server took his plate away, apologized and brought him back a new plate and said his plate would not be charged on the bill. We had both lost our appetite at that point. I was sick or else I would have made a big deal about it. But this is not acceptable. The fact that the french fries and bacon were cooked together and hidden from customers is appalling. What if my fiance had eaten the bacon? People who don't eat pork for (the many reasons listed above) typically feel very strongly about NOT EATING IT! WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK"}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins before being served. Would have been longer if we did not ask to be served.   Waitress forgot half my drinks and service was slow. The manager gave us complimentary smoothy drinks which were not even going to order, but that does not make up for the bad service.  We should have received complimentary drinks based on what we were ordering. Otherwise the food was great."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast places go, Cora's is fine. I much prefer smaller, mom and pop places. That being said, Cora's does have great quality food and excellent service. I ordered a coffee and the mac n'cheese grilled cheese sandwich... it usually comes with bacon, but I asked for them to make mine without. The coffee is okay... it's nothing spectacular, but it's good enough. The food? What food? They totally forgot about my food! Everyone at our table had received their orders and it wasn't until I asked that the server realized I didn't get my food. She brought it out reasonably quickly but a few bites into my food, I realized there was little bits of bacon in my grilled cheese. Unfortunately, it turned me off enough to just stop eating (I'm a picky vegetarian, remember?). The server was nice enough about the mix-up and offered to bring me another dish and removing the item off the bill. In spite of the mistake, the service was great and overall the quality of the food was good.  I would go here again because it's nice for groups and they have items on their menu that are sure to please everyone."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The food was cold and tasteless like an old boot fished out of an old creek.  Our waiter was also a collapsing man that made us sit and wait for the credit card machine to go up again because we had no cash.  Our party had been up for more than 24 hours and all we wanted to do was leave and get to the hotel for a few hours sleep before checkout. It seemed like we waited forever.  I probably could have written a novel at the table while waiting, but I didn't bring my typewriter and I don't draft on paper. I'm better than that.  The decor was cheap and Cora herself looks like a catfish that swam past the food they fished out of the aforementioned creek. Whenever I see a Cora restaurant I will take the chance on a speeding ticket just to get it out of my sight.  Shut it down!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: I ordered the Spinach and Cheddar Crepeomlette with Hollandaise Sauce. It was delicious!  Freshly made to order with lots of fresh fruit on the side. The food look EXACTLY as shown in the photos on the menu. Prices of each \"brunch\" dish is between $10 - $15.  Tea costs $2.45 but that's with unlimited \"hot water\".   Facility: Warm, clean, brightly lit. Ambiance is quite noisy though (Sunday around noon) and the place is pretty packed. Utensils were clean, trouble finding some parking in the plaza.   Service: Great service. The host/manager was very kind, seated us quickly and personally came to say good bye.  Waitress was kind and efficient.  She also offered information up front \"Would you like any mushroom or cheese on top of your fries? It tastes good but does cost extra.\"  Attentive but not pushy, I was very pleased despite the fact that they were at full capacity. Also has FREE open wifi.  Overall: Had a wonderful experience. Hoping that this service and food quality is consistent. For a breakfast/brunch place, definitely met my expectation. Will return soon."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning and was able to get a seat right away. Food was great and we didn't have to wait to long.  I was happy with this location service."}
{"text":"Cora's is widely known for its range of creative breakfasts, most served with a healthy helping of fruit! This branch is no exception. After a rocky patch a couple of years ago, service is back up to being friendly, prompt and accurate. The food was also cooked and served to our expectations.     I'd gladly recommend this branch to anyone for a good breakfast or lunch, served in a clean, congenial atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today and waitress was rude or seemed over worked  Last time I went for breakfast was 2 months ago and nothing has changed Will give 1 more chance and then it's 3 strikes and I will never go back to this location  Food was just ok and served in reasonable time Had to ask several times for a coffee refill"}
{"text":"When did breakfast become a $50 venture for the family?  Special occasion maybe, like in 2012, just before the word ends, so you don't actually have to pay the credit card bill.  Everything was overpriced and it felt like I had to mine through the fruit to find my breakfast.  I think Cora lost her way on the way to Toronto."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but a serious upgrade over the regular breakfast at a Greasy Spoon,  Lots of healthy options."}
{"text":"Service is really slow but the foid quality during brunch time is awesome. Really like their eggs, omellete & crapes."}
{"text":"I loathe the fact that breakfast options are so limited in the area.  Bluestone bistro used to be amazing but unfortunately closed due to the impact of highway 7 construction on customer volumes.  You know what you're getting at Cora's - and for me, that's not enough to bring me back on any kind of regular basis.  I would reluctantly bring my family here due to lack of options."}
{"text":"Great location, good food. Busy as HELL on the weekends!!! Lineup outside of the door!!!"}
{"text":"On one hand, it's nice that this place serves fresh fruit (as it gets for this city) as plentiful as it does. But it's a French style breakfast, so I wouldn't go insofar to suggest that this place is healthy. It's not. But eating out for breakfast is not about healthiness. Unless you're an idiot. I digress.  On the other hand, this place looks like my classroom in grade 2."}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast joint, with lots of good flavour. The atmosphere is on par for a typical breakfast restaurant...no different then a Smittys, Denny's, Perkins, or Humptys....all the same, just a different name and a few minor differences.  They focus more on crepes, but the typical eggs p, omelettes, and waffles are pretty good. Service has always been good and always fast. Very accommodating it kids and the kids love having crepes.   It's a nice place to try when you need a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love their omelettes however I find each time I order coffee I have to ask for splenda as it is not on the tables with the sugar.  On many occasions the waitress has forgotten my splenda and I have to ask more than once and by the time I get it my coffee is cold."}
{"text":"Zero stars because we made the trip-following Yelp directions, but found an empty park across from Canadian Tire where the restaurant should have been. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I've walked past this Cora's while shopping at North Land mall and every time there's always a ridiculous long lineup outside that it's definitely discouraged me to try this location.  Although after my good experience at the Bow Valley location, our friend suggested to meet for brunch here so we decided to try it out.  We figured since it was the Monday of the long weekend it would be busy and wow, were we right. When we arrived, I counted 25 people ahead of us. My friend said that the line usually goes quick, and even the hostess coming around said the wait was about 10-15 mins. So we waited . . . and waited . . . and waited . . . for 40 MINUTES!   Once we were finally seated (slightly irritated and overly hungry), our server was quick to get our drink and food orders. This time I went with the strawberry and custard waffle, my boyfriend got the Cora's special (with added cheese) and our two friends both got the 1990's harvest.  Our food arrived pretty fast, I was surprised at how big the waffle was and its overflowing mountain of strawberries. The Cora's special wasn't big on presentation - it looked like everything was just thrown on the plate and the added cheese was a measly sprinkle on the hash browns (which apparently warrants for an extra $3 charge . . .) The 1990's Harvest had a hearty helping of fruit as well, again not too big on presentation there either.  We all ate quickly as if it was our last meal and decided to get outta there ASAP since the multiple families waiting in line were finally piling in - cranky/crying toddlers in tow (I know how you feel kid - 40 mins to wait to get in somewhere is redic!)  Honestly, I won't be back to this location. The food isn't that great to torture myself to stand in line for that long again"}
{"text":"Always a wait to get in. If you have a simple egg allergy, the apparently make \"absolutely no substitutions\" and are unwilling to make accommodation and just frankly rude about it. Staff is unpleasant. Every time we have had a similar experience. Go to Denny's for brunch!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place to grab breakfast/brunch! I love their mountain of fresh fruit!! The waffle is great, there's sooo much fresh fruit, and the custard sauce is to DIE FOR! big portion size too!   follow my food ig for more reviews: @gta.eatss"}
{"text":"Perfect place if you want to take the kids for breakfast...however we 2 adults felt the ambiance slightly chaotic and playschool-ish. Our server was tired and grumpy and literally told us so. She leaned on the table and the oddly located beam that was butt up against our table. I requested a beverage from the server who delivered our meals and never received it. Upon advising our waitress she opted to put down her fellow coworker. Menu has something for everyone but the breakfast was average. The copious amounts of fruit served with the meal was wonderful. When paying we had to wait for the 2 young ladies to finish discussing which of the side duties they hated most before they decided it was time to take our $. Will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Aside the slow service, the food is great. Havent tried any of their lunch dishes, but the breakfast food is a hit with everyone who I've gone with! From the eggs, to the spinach crepes and smoothies this coras is a great place to go with family and friends for an early morning breakfast. However be warned, it will be crowded and service will be slower than slow..."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of breakfast dishes .. the servings are huge .. am never able to finish everything out of my plate ..fruits taste fresh and the ambience is good too. They can re-consider their prices though. I go there often and plan to continue doing so."}
{"text":"Cora's is busy and no one would ever confuse it with being quiet but the food is good."}
{"text":"If there is no Star will not give any! WOREST Brunch Ever.  My plate was the worst plate ever. Am I asked to substitute the beacon and the sausage to baked potato,they refused ti do that. After that brought me over cooked burned potato!! I asked her why its like that, the manager told me that how we serve the potato!!!! And I know how Cora they serve it very nice and tasty at York mills (Cora).  Not recommended at All."}
{"text":"Cora's holds a soft spot in my heart - I have such memories of popping up here the morning after a cast party or a load-in during my university theatre days. I always liked that I felt like I was doing something a little bit healthier for myself than just downing Denny's.   Now, I don't know if my standards have just gone up a tidge since I entered the working world and thereby decided I could afford the slightly more pricey brunch fare of Diner Deluxe, Blue Star Diner, et al but my last visit to Cora's was just okay. We picked the location because my friend was working at 1:00 at Market Mall and hitting up Northland meant she wouldn't have to rush off to work.  The food was fresh as always and my fruit was adorably plated, but I had a hard time finding anything I really WANTED on the menu. The girl serving us was very friendly but all the timing was a little bit off - I arrived about 10-15 minutes before my friend and grabbed a table, but the server didn't come over or check in until my friend joined me. I guess not a big deal - but it would have been nice to enjoy a coffee while I was waiting!  I probably wouldn't wait in the massive Saturday/Sunday morning lineup that tends to acrue, but I'll still keep Cora's on my list for when I want to amp it up from Denny's a wee bit. Maybe after my next cast party?"}
{"text":"Food would be good if it came to the table hot, the server remembered the syrup, butter etc. first cup of coffee comes quickly, if you want a second make sure your not in a hurry. Suggested they bring a thermos or two to the table instead of having to come back again and again. DOES ANYONE FROM CORA's read these comments, it doesn't appear so. Everyone have commented on the service or lack of service."}
{"text":"Worst coras experience ever. Asked for water it came after my meal arrived... Asked for no tomatoes on omelette but wanted slices, some how waitress thought it was comical, but it still arrived with tomatoes.  Sh8t experience"}
{"text":"While it's not easy on the wallet, it's nice to come to Cora's once in a while to have a nice breakfast. The menus are colourful and detailed, the service is pretty quick and the wait time isn't too bad (if it's busy, you may have to wait for a table though. Perhaps that's a sign for how popular it is).  I'd personally recommend the Rosemary Sunday breakfast. Eggs, bacon, toast, taters and blueberry pancakes on the side! Perfecto!"}
{"text":"People used to line up to have breakfast/brunch at Cora's, well not anymore at this location.   We were seated immediately on a Saturday morning, and ordered our usual - Sunshine Panini and Crepe-Omelette.   While I love this dish at other locations, the panini wrap was under-cooked and cold in certain areas, as if it were microwaved. The tiny bowl of fruit on the side just looked sad. I'm not sure why this item in particular doesn't come with their infamous 'mountain' of fruits.   The fruits weren't the freshest either - the pineapple was super sour and hard, the strawberry was soggy & the grapes looked unwashed. They really need to work on presentation at this location.   The spinach and cheddar crepe-omelette was A-OK except that the sauce was cold.   I don't think I would come back to spend over $13 for a plate of semi-warm wrap and fruit that's been left out for too long."}
{"text":"I love the food here especially the eggs florentine and the smoothies. I can get really crazy busy at this location on the weekend but as my office isn't too far away this is a great location for a breakfast meeting or a a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I've experienced better!  Its been a quite a while for me eating at cora's as I have been going to other breakfast places. Well this time at work we decided to have lunch at Cora's.  The place itself is designed very good and has a lot of seating available. The decor is quite colorful.  The server was nice and quite friendly. She also brought the food in a decent time.   The menu seems to have shrunk over the year and seemed a little little on breakfast choices compared to other restaurants. But still enough choices to choose from.  I went with there lunch special - Chef's choice of omelette with lentil soup, salad, potatoes and toast. The lentil soup came first and it was good and warn. Then came the rest of the stuff and the omelette was quite big and done up nicely. The salad was ok and seemed to have some canned vegs. Whereas, potatoes were no the best. Over all the meal was filling and was quite light on the pocket as well.   My friends on the other hand had Pancakes and a massive cheese omelet with potatoes and that was decent as well. Their pancake portions is good for at least 2 people."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday morning at 6:30. Service was incredibly fast. Waited about 5 minutes for my meal. The meal itself was overall very nice. The potatoes hash was a little unnderdone, but otherwise a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food... eggs and cheese, yum!  The menu is large and so it was hard to make a decision, but I went with an omelet and it was fab.  I was just a tourist passing through, but this joint was great for tea and hit of brunch."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to come here for his birthday so went with him for lunch. I got the 1990's special with cinnamon French toast with bacon, egg, and fruit while friends got an omlette a breakfast special.   1990's has that sweet and savory thing going on which works pretty well, the omlette is supposedly good too.   Would go back again, staff was friendly and sang for my friends birthday."}
{"text":"Cora's is a pretty decent breakfast chain. You get lots of fresh fruit with delicious crepes, egg benedict or waffles. This location felt like a diner and the staff was a little abrupt, but my food was still good!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast choices. There's always fresh fruit available with every entree. Their crepes are heavenly and their Belgian waffles are light and fluffy. When I'm in T-dot Cora's is always part of my itinerary."}
{"text":"First time I went to this place it was at the 130th location a while back.  Just my daughter & I around 11 am on a Tuesday.  That may explain why there was no line up.  However, should you decide to visit this place on a weekend at any given time expect to wait a while.  A long while.  The menu has a wide variety of choices for every palate whether you want an omelet, pancakes, crepes etc... The fruit that accompanies your meal almost makes the long wait worth it.  This is my third time visiting a Cora's in Calgary, but this time I think the line up did me in."}
{"text":"I found Cora's to be bland and a few dollars per plate too expensive. I was visiting from San Diego and had the 2 egg 2 bacon plate and my mom had a French toast plate with some sliced fruit and coffee. The coffee was tasteless. The food tasted like something I would be able to make at home (I am a poor cook). There was no attempt to be creative or innovative.  I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"So far, so good... Beware... No pulp in the orange juice..."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for breakfast and lunch. Good options for vegetarians. Portions are good too."}
{"text":"Rude and unprofessional manager. The restaurant has amazing staff, but a rude and careless manager. When I asked the manager to help us out so they could accommodate a party of 8 and we have already been waiting for 45 minutes for a table, he yelled saying \"you have to wait\". I tried talking to him trying to find a solution so maybe we can site at two separate tables, and he rudely ignored me and walked away."}
{"text":"This is my place for a decent breakfast, the only downside is there is always a line waiting to get in. I've never gone to this place, went in, and got a seat immediately. Its ALWAYS jampacked.  The ambiance here is great, the servers are very pleasant and well trained and of course, the food is fantastic. To avoid line-ups I've tried eggsmart, sunset grill, even dennys and I have to say Cora's is still the best by far. It's easy to notice that the sausages they have are of better quality and everything else is done well consistently. Portions are also good.  With the exception of the constant wait, there really is no reason for me to complain about this place."}
{"text":"Definitely an A-OK place... Just came here with my sis-in-law with 3 small kids. Satisfied all our brunch cravings. - Eggs benny w/ smoked salmon - Omelette - Kids brioche with strawberries - Kids crepe with banana n nutella Bill came up to $45 (incl. Tax n tip). Good food but not great, we got seated pretty fast during the Saturday brunch rush. Friendly service, a little slow, but understandable."}
{"text":"We were amazed, quite honestly.  We thought it looked sketchy on the outside, but once we were served, we were  delighted. Totally would recommend this place, and the yoghurt parfait.  Fruit GALORE!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cora's twice before for breakfast, and I can say it's A-OK. The only big plus is the staff, who are hardworking and take their job seriously.  They have a variety of different breakfast plates, but they do charge for more than what is given.  The restaurant itself, though sticking to the brand needs a revamp. It looks like the inside of a preschool.  I've had the fruit crepe and the oatmeal and it's nothing to write home about. The fruit crepe is pretty light, and the oatmeal is nice for when the weather is cold.  Pretty standard overall... I would recommend it for families with small children."}
{"text":"Don't understand the poor ratings given to this place.   I went there on a Sunday morning (10:30am) and it was packed. Needed to wait a couple of minutes to get a seat but the overall process was fine. Sure, the prices are on the expensive end especially for a breakfast (expect around 15 bucks per person before tip and tax) but the quality and choices they offer do justify the price in my opinion.   The portions should be good enough for most people (remember, this is a brunch hence it should be \"lighter\" than a regular lunch). Service was more than fine too."}
{"text":"Come here for an artery declogging breakfast.  Potentially.   Cora's is your neighborhood go-to for a healthier alternative to your traditional western breakfast / brunch. I say healthier as along with the regular sausage, eggs and bacon items on their menu, most of their entrees come with heaping piles of fresh fruit. Something that was very uncommon until they came to town. Originally based in Quebec , these guys were a game changer in my book for having fresher, brighter options to start off your day.   I've been to Cora's a number of times, and their food has always been consistently good. I am a big fan of their sunshine crepe panini with ham; it is always satisfying to the last bite.   We ordered the panini and the special for the season which featured 3 chocolate chip pancakes , 3 eggs, wedges and some toast. The food took a very long time today although their were hardly any diners. Their normally pretty on top of their delivery times so i won't dwell on it.  The pancakes were very good, the chocolate added a nice touch of sweetness. I chose the rye toast with the entree and that was toasted to a T . The wedges didn't have a crisp to them though and were a bit too soft. Overall, it was a pretty well cooked simplistic dish for somebody wanting something sweet and salty at the same time.   Our waitress Paula was very attentive which was a bonus. She probably filled our coffee 5 times and proactively offered to get us water which was thoughtful considering our level of caffeinated dehydration at that point."}
{"text":"Standard generic North American breakfast. Pricey but what do you really expect."}
{"text":"Service was somewhat slow, as we had to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated . There was quite couple behind us that left out of frustration. When they did come, the waitstaff were nice and friendly.   Food also took a while to get to the table, but I don't mind. It tasted good, and was quite flavorful."}
{"text":"Tired and bland feeling. When this restaurant first opened near me it was a nice change of pace from the usual stodgy, greasy breakfast places with its fruit heavy plates. But, honestly, now that it has been there awhile the food has consistently failed to impress. As mentioned, it's a nice change of pace to have lighter breakfast with more fruit, but it always seems like when they bring you the food the fresh fruit on the side has been cut up way too long ago and just isn't appealing. Also, the food seems overpriced for what you're getting. With so much of the plate being fruit, you'd think it'd be more affordable than it is or at least on par with better breakfast places. The actual meal is always done proficiently, but don't expect anything special or with any flair. Also, I often go there with someone who is allergic to certain type's fruit and every time she specifically asks for these to be left off the plate and it's always a hassle (sending it back, etc.) to get it done.  Underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've only been to Cora's on weekends and haven't been to Cora's in quite sometime but was in the area. We arrived after 9:30am on a Wednesday and no wait and were seated promptly. The place wasn't super busy but was steady with patrons. Service was excellent and food was great. Pricing is very reasonable and love that all meals come with lots of fruit.  The only negative is the coffee they serve here. I'm not sure what kind they have but I wasn't a fan. I love coffee and I'm not over picky but the coffee here isn't that great. I didn't even finish one cup and usually I have three at other places for brunch/breakfast. Would be back again for the food and service."}
{"text":"We walked in at 2:30 to an empty restaurant with freshly mopped floors. The man in charge warned us of the slick floors and brought us to our table with a girl who seemed very uncomfortable. Once he seated us he placed the menus on the table and introduced himself, \"I'm __(don't recall the name)____ and I have an employee in orientation.\" He then turned to the girl \"you see, I did this wrong. You must hand the menu to them once they have seated.\" Then he realized he forgot the lunch menu and excused himself to get some of those.  We looked over each menu and nothing suited our fancy. We were able to realize this before I opened the can of Coke they brought for me and we excused ourselves with little fuss on their end."}
{"text":"cora is very cute. Lots of fruits. Sweet and salt combo works magic for me. Ordered 1990s harvest, Mexican crepe( came with salsa potato mushrooms). Came after 1:30. Not much people left, enjoyed with fast speed of serving, and our waitress Naomi is really good"}
{"text":"As some of you know, I'm on the lookout for a favourite brunch spot in Calgary. After having lived in Chicago, where they officially have the BEST brunch spots in the world, I NEED to find a local place that gives me heart palpitations.   Everyone and their dog has been talking my ear off about Cora's. So naturally, I decided to try it. Gotta be honest - I wouldn't say it's all that.   Yes I love the fact that Cora's serves a multitude of breakfast dishes that are ALWAYS garnished with a beautiful heap of fruit. Yes I love the fact that their booths are comfy and everyone who is there has a big smile on their face. Yes I love that they are TRYING to be my new favourite brunch spot, but you know what, no cigar. The service was fine but my omelette itself was nothing special. The coffee wasn't great and there wasn't a million things on the menu that I was DYING to try.   I can tell you right now, I'm not going back. It just wasn't 'WOW-Worthy' and the place I'm looking for will be.   Stay Tuned."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to give four stars for this, but there are several factors that bring the score down.  Not surprisingly, other reviewers have had this problem as well.  Chez Cora is super popular with the breakfast and lunch crowd.  This has the effect of producing line-ups.  But it does not seem that volume is so much the problem as is speed.  The servers and bussers appear to be very slow - VERY slow - at clearing, cleaning, and re-setting tables after patrons finish and leave.  It seems that this problem is the kernel at the core of the long lines.  With this in mind, I do not recommend Chez Cora for parties larger than about five or six people.  It just takes too long to put enough tables together for such groups, unless you get there really early, I suppose.  That said, the food is fantastic!  Once you are seated and the specials are explained, things are often much faster.  While French-style breakfasts are not generally supremely healthy, they don't have to be un-healthy.  You just have to be careful what you order.  I got the western omelette, which was both different and delicious, and was served with a side of fresh fruit.  The fruit servings change seasonally, so is rarely made up of the same things on different visits.  I personally do not like melons, but this time around there was only one piece, so it was not a problem.  As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, the bright, open layout and design of the dining room is reminiscent of early grade school, but that just makes it more fun."}
{"text":"Had the eggs benedict this morning. The service was very good, eggs and hollandaise were  great but although the fruit is made to look really pretty on your plate, it was really warm and the banana wasnt fully ripe so it all  went to waste."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to grab breakfast on the way from Toronto to Niagara Falls, and we stopped here because it wasn't very far off the freeway.  The food here was really unimpressive, and the restaurant appeared to be running very inefficiently.  They had huge lines of people everywhere - waiting for tables, waiting to pay, etc. This is because there was a whopping one person handling everything, and they were obviously pretty overloaded.  When we finally got seated and ordered our food, we had to wait a loonnnggg time for it to come out.  And when it finally did come out, it was fairly bland.  I'd recommend avoiding this place, although I suppose it's possible they're actually decent and I just had a bad experience."}
{"text":"If you just want some bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, or cereal. Then Coras is horrible value for money, and you could make the same thing but better tasting at home. (2 stars)  If you've already eaten breakfast, and you're not starving. Then Coras is great for their fancier things that are kind of breakfast, kind of dessert, usually involving a lot of berries and fruit, with some delicious syrupy goodness. (4 stars)"}
{"text":"It's taken me many visits, but I've finally figured out Coras!!  If you're hungry, either eat before going to Coras or don't go at all. The only filling things on their menu are the meaty dishes of bacon, sausage, ham, etc. But those are the least flavorful, most disappointing things you can order!! Especially for $11 each, and they taste worse than what you could make at home.  Their omelettes are all right, tasty but not very satisfying. You'll probably be hungry again by the time you leave the parking lot.  So either pre-eat before going, or fill up on a $4 smoothie. And then try out their breakfast items that could also be considered dessert. Those at least taste good, and you're unlikely to make them at home, so they're worth the $10 or so."}
{"text":"It became a almost a family tradition coming here for breakfast. The food is amazing and they give you big portions that fill you up. We always get a few different things to share.  Highly recommend their omelets!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab brunch. Lots of items with fresh fruit, which is a plus. It's a chain, so don't expect to be blown away by the food, but I've enjoyed most of my meals here. The western omelette is pretty good.  The service is friendly and excellent, which is the biggest plus for this restaurant.   My main complaint is that the tables near the front are freezing in the winter, despite having a double door system. My secondary complaint is just how busy this restaurant is on the weekend, but you can't fault them for that."}
{"text":"How can you not like Cora's? It's breakfast made awesomely.   Everything at Cora's is so tasty, I always leave full and satisfied.   The most recent visit I had a crepe filled with strawberries and chocolate, and it met every need I had that morning.   Cora's is a great place to go with people to hang out, drink coffee, eat breakfast. It doesn't feel like an intimate brunch place, it is a welcoming breakfast place that also happens to serve amazing breakfast.   Because of these reasons there is always a line up. Be prepared for this."}
{"text":"If you love fruit, Cora's is the place to be. Servers are quick and efficient and so are the cooks. This place gets PACKED on the weekends, so either go early or just before noon.   I've tried lots of breakfasts here and they're always good. The menu changes every once in awhile to keep things interesting. Last time I was there I tried a Crepeomelette. It had a western omelette rolled into a tortilla and smothered in bernaise sauce. Mmmmm. The sauce wasn't overly salty either.  They have a gluten free menu too! My mom tried the Gigi Omelette; it's got egg whites, mushrooms, spinach and caramelized onions with gluten-free toast. She loved it!  Perhaps one day, I'll actually try lunch!"}
{"text":"I like Cora's breakfast menu choices compared to more traditional diners.  I don't think the quality of food is any worse than any of its competitors.  Don't mistake poor service with poor quality food.  And honestly, breakfast sausages are not gourmet cuisine.  Hardly an indication of the quality of a restaurant, let alone a diner chain.  The service is most certainly hit and miss.  Sometimes it's acceptable, other times it's just slow.  As an example, our empty coffee cups took way too long to be tended to.  In a diner, there should be designated coffee server who is around almost too frequently."}
{"text":"Try Denny's in crowfoot crossing!   And you'll see the difference between restaurants Denny's has Hot doos great fast waiters The manager comes over to see how our meal was    If you would like slow service and cold food go to Cora s   Myself I like piping hot food and fast service  Also Denny's is cheaper than Coors save your time eat hot food save money go to Denny's"}
{"text":"Never tried Cora's before, but my girl and I decided to give it a whirl after driving by it on Hurontario.  The restaurant is pretty straight forward, with little to no flash at all. The servers all seem very courteous and helpful.  The menu was very fruity! Not in the 'thuper!' kind of way, but a LOT of fruit options to order! I ended up going fruitless, and ordered eggs, bacon, toast, sausage, and those potato slices with cheese (I liked those a lot!). My girlfriend ordered an omelette, which she enjoyed.   I think it's impossible to review this without drawing comparisons to Eggsmart, so I'll just get right down to it: Eggsmart does this exact breakfast tastier, better cooked, and for a few bucks cheaper. That's not to say that this isn't good, it is, but it's not the best bang for your buck. Not to mention this place was way busier than Eggsmart usually is. I hate to sound negative though, as I will return one day. This place isn't bad."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I always end up coming back time and time again, forgetting why I aways say I won't be back... #memoryofagoldfish  If you are looking for a traditional bacon & eggs brekkie, this a good place to go! I end up getting the construction pretty much every time, which is a good one to go with if you're ever unsure of what to choose. They make that kinda stuff pretty standard each and every time. For some reason, I decided to pick something off the lunch menu: the Pulled Pork Mac 'n Cheese. Sounds amazing, right? Nah, was below average for sure! Not a strong flavour you come to expect from pulled pork at all! Also supposed to come with a salad (which they gave my home fries instead...), but it was essentially lettuce with no dressing and a couple strawberries! Did come with Chicken Noodle soup which was decent though. My brother also got the Panini off the lunch menu, and had the same expression I did...  I had a free coffee, which was nice, but still pricey overall at about $40 for 3 people! Service isn't always the greatest, as they always seem to miss things and make mistakes. Decor also reminds of a kindergarten classroom with large, colourful pictures on the wall! Lol. A relatively small location to boot, I'd say go down the street to the other location if you insist on going.  To Cora: until the next time I forget!"}
{"text":"The food was as expected. Tasty and fresh. Our server Bal was great. Friendly and efficient.  I would go back to this location."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place had stuck around in this plaza so long considering the food that is served here. I came here with an old friend for brunch on a Saturday and we were shocked at the rush they were experiencing. We got seated quickly but our food came out after two other tables who had ordered after us. The food was quite overpriced and very mediocre. Somethings (like the French toast) looked and tasted so bad that we couldn't even eat them. Even the fruit, what this place is known for, was a disappointment. The meal was expensive for such poor quality food, it came out to $22 after tax and tip for a very SMALL smoothie and an eggs benedict with one one egg. The only reason I didn't give this place one star is because our server was extremely kind, friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"This place seems to be busy all the time on weekends.   I've only been here once and wasn't swayed enough to go back. The service was slow, and not very accurate. When I asked them not to put pineapple on my plate, the waitress wrote it down, went away, and didn't come back for a half hour with our food, our very expensive food.   And in the centre of my beautiful, yet expensive plate, was a generous serving of pineapple.  When she asked me if there was an allergy or just a preference or taste, I said, does it matter?    At which point she reaches into my plate, with her bare hands, and removed the pineapple. I surprised myself with how calm and composed I had been during the whole thing...   Needless to say, $65 for a breakfast for three later, this was he last time were ever there."}
{"text":"I really love Cora's. The only downside is the huge line that forms if you come at the wrong time, however, it moves pretty quickly. The food is always fresh at Cora's. I've never had a bad experience here and considering how busy it is, the servers are very quick and are always checking up on us seeing if we need more drinks or anything else. I always get the ham and swiss crepeomlette. It's a ham and swiss cheese omlette wrapped up in a crepe, covered in hollandaise sauce servced with fruit and toast. It's SO good! My boyfriend always gets the banana blast crepe. It is a crepe filled with nutella (or some sort of chocolate spread), fresh bananas, and wrapped up in a crepe topped with whipped cream. The crepe is huge and normally we end up taking half our meals home to snack on later."}
{"text":"For a Saturday morning, this place was quite dead.   Our waitress was friendly but pretty slow with bringing out the orders.   I ordered the Tuna Melt sandwich w/ fruit + strawberry/banana smoothie (yum!)  and my boyfriend had the 'Gargantuan Breakfast' and coffee.  Our waitress dropped 1/2 of my sandwich on the floor so I had to wait about 15 minutes for a new one. I was a little miffed but I got over it - accidents happen.   My boyfriend's meal had a wide variety of breakfast foods - including beans. Unfortunately, they were microwaved (piping hot on the outside & freezing cold in the centre). My tuna melt was delicious and I even got another 1/2 to go because of the mix-up.   I will probably try another location in Mississauga next time."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great tea and coffee, very friendly staff that saw our Toronto Guide and gave us some great ideas.  We tried a different breakfast place each day and this was one of the top, the bill was expensive but Toronto in general was expensive.  I would return and recommend this place without reservation."}
{"text":"I always like Cora's food but this place is getting worst and worst. They are expensive! And the food is not so good anymore. For the price they charge, I expect good food and service.  My breakfast came with rotten strawberries and dry cantaloupe. It was nasty.  And also the portion is getting smaller and smaller. Many times the hollandaise sauce on my dish is ridiculously little. When u ask for more, they want u to pay extra for that. So bad.   And the service is bad. Actually service is always bad. There is this Chinese waitress who never smile and talk to you in a very rush, unwelcome and rude way.  Everytime I go, I wish I don't get her as my server but somehow I always ended up with her. It is terrible.    I really hope u can improve and take a look at your food and customer service, and not just blinding grabbing money from your customers cause you think we don't have many breakfast choices in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place one of my favorite places for Sunday breakfast. Come here at least 3 times a month with family.  Only down side you have be here before 11 or your going to wait... Highly recommend the eggs Benedict... Fresh fruit what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"First time here and the service was great. The server greeted, seated, and took our order right away. Our food came super fast and at the same time which is always nice.  The portions are also big so prepare to have takeout if you do not eat a lot. I love this location and will definitely come!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cora's but the Vaughan location left me underwhelmed. I went as a party of 4 and 3 out of the 4 dishes had undercooked and/or overcooked items. My sausage, for example, was so burnt that I could barely cut it in half. It also seems (and I'm not sure if this is the franchisee's fault or the company as a whole) but they're choosing lower-end ingredients. The beef patty in the Brunch Burger looked microwaved and flimsy. As a higher-end breakfast place I expect more. It's a good concept but it was badly executed. If you can't offer quality dishes, don't put them on your menu.  The redeeming factor is that service was quick, but I'm starting to think that's because less and less people are choosing to go here....  I would recommend going somewhere else for breakfast in Vaughan. Galaxie Diner is way better and more affordable."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and ordered the crepes. Normally do not like anything overly sweet but the crepes were not even sugary.  The waiter was alright, not overly content we ordered waters but it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to this location for the bright and colourful atmosphere.  My favourite dish is the Eggs Benedictine with Brie cheese and Mushroom with potatoes and fruit on the side.  The fruit always seems to be selected with great quality.  I've always found the service to be exceptional: our order comes out fast, accurate, and coffee is always refilled.    All the selections in the menu look really appealing and appetizing. I really have admired Cora's ability to constantly create new dishes over the years."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food quality not up to the standards of other Cora's locations. Go to other location down the street."}
{"text":"This is quite honestly the worst dining experience I've had anywhere in the GTA after living here 3 years. The orange juice was cheap concentrate, the coffee was watered down and there was no sweetener on the table. (There wasn't any jelly available for our toast either.)  We waited at  1.5+ hours for food. We asked two different waitresses for an update on our order and neither returned. When the food finally arrived it was lukewarm/cold and didn't taste all that good. Judging by the other tables around us - I don't think we were the only dissatisfied patrons.  When we complained to the manager she offered a $5.00 discount - when we checked our bill she'd actually only given us a $4.50 discount.   I won't return to this location ever again and I'll think long and hard before going to any other Cora's."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast.  Lots of omelette, waffle, crepe, and egg dishes to choose from.  After having been to a number of breakfast joints in US, my parents commented that Cora's dishes \"are beautifully presented, look healthier, and taste just as good\".    This Cora is located in a strip mall at the corner of Warden-Hwy 7.  Nothing exciting nor inviting on the outside to draw you in, but once inside, you will find it's sunny, cozy, and often energetically busy.  Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Went here to catch up with some high school friends. First impression, super busy. Service was fast and great. We got a waiter name Chris :) he was very patient and kind despite the amount of tables he was serving. I ordered the eggs Benedict with Salmon total came up to 21$ with tip. Not bad since I got the salmon . However, the taste was pretty bland . Reason why I'm giving three stars is due to the taste , as well as the piece of hair I found in the egg.... lost my appetite. Other than that, pretty average. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Cora's and have always found the food and service very good. The people at this location were suburb. We were greeted at the door in a pleasant and sincere fashion. The wait staff were prompt and friendly. The food was great and I would recommend anyone to try this location."}
{"text":"I love this place, they are so accommodating.  Some family members were leaving and we had a little breakfast send off here at Cora's complete with face-time thanks to their in house wifi.  How cool is that.  So they are a great place for a group, and as far as breakfast goes, its much healthier than some of the alternative places.  So the food is good, the coffee cup was always full, the price is right and everyone was happy.  You cant ask for much more than that.  Its a bit loud but all that activity seems to suggest a lot of people enjoying their time and chatting and being social.  For breakfast comfort food, this place is one we can always depend on for satisfaction"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a while but nothing much has changed. All Cora restaurants keep the same quality and service to all their locations. The fruit is a hit and miss at times due to ripeness. The service is just slightly above par.  I'm always coming back for the eggs benedict with mushroom and brie. And their coffee is always good."}
{"text":"The food definitely looks better in the photos, as usual, so come in with average expectations.   Yes, Coras is overpriced for a good portion of items on their menu ( 6oz of fresh juice = 4$ ) and yes, service isn't spectacular either, BUT - they have a large variety of items .. literally couldn't choose today.. and they have gluten free as well as healthier choices.   I have only been to Coras a few times for the blueberry pancakes, which are hella good in my opinion, but tried something off their new Fall lunch menu today- the Mexican Crepe. It wasn't bad, but the black beans had a chipotle flavour which I'm not a fan of... nothing that couldn't be fixed with some salsa, sour cream and hot sauce though. Side salad  with some odd bean mix which was supposed to be quinoa was sad, also came with a soup side which I took to go. The meal plus my sad cup of juice was just under 18$."}
{"text":"it was good, the food was good service was ok.  It was noisy and the people beside us were loud and kind of ignorant asking why they dont serve halal.  They probably dont serve halal because they dont need your business.   If you want halal go somewhere else, otherwise shut up and let the rest of us enjoy our meal.    I will give it another try and hopefully its not as loud and i have different people sitting beside us.  Bottom line the food was good, the service was laid back, they are in no rush, but at the end of the day you got what you paid for."}
{"text":"This Cora's has terrible service and food. I recommend NOT going to eat lunch there. Maybe just stick with their breakfast.  I ordered their lunch special - soup and sandwich. Had the soup of the day and tuna salad sandwich. The soup was warm and was all broth. The sandwich was soggy and not appealing at all.  The service was extremely slow and spilled my soup on the table and my shoes. They didn't even bother to clean that up.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Been to a couple of Cora's locally and in Montreal.  The food is consistent and portions huge.  Usually have Theo's omelette which comes with a slice of fruit, potatoes and your choice of toast.  The 7 of July is also good if you like lots of fruit with French toast and crepes.  Service is either really good or mediocre.  Seems to depend which section you get and the regular servers are usually good, topping up your  coffee regularly.  It can get busy around noon so be prepared to wait in line on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I love going to coras. One of the reasons why I like it is because of the healthy choices. Unfortunately, this time around was a horrible experience.  1) service was VERY slow. Our brunch took 2 hours to complete because of the service. I just couldn't believe it.   2) the portions were so small. I think they were running out of food so started to skimp out on the food. If you look at my pic, the bowl of yogurt was half full (if that). As the service was crap, I didn't want to wait to complain. I thought it would be ok, except when we were done, we were still hungry. FYI the kids meals were VERY VERY SMALL. My kids finished in 5 minutes and asked for seconds.   3) the dish I like the most is the Greek yogurt. That didn't happen because the ran out of both strawberries and Greek yogurt. I ended up getting the regular yogurt. Maybe that's the reason why there was so little.  4) waitress never came back to ask how thing were. We ran out of drinks while waiting for our food. Not a very good experience  Overall may not go back except for the fact the food is very good"}
{"text":"I wish I can leave ZERO stars. The service is horrible and food is bland. the only good thing here is the fresh fruit, I'm sure you can pick that up at your neighborhood supermarket."}
{"text":"I decided to give this location another try and definitely saw an improvement. Wincy, the customer service manager came to apologize personally for the poor service last visit, which I appreciated. I got the hazelnut banana crepe smaller portion, but it was still huge! I recommend sharing a dish if you don't have a huge appetite. There was actually jam for our toast this time, and our waitress was friendly. Would come back again for bunch!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place.  Their menu is really big and u can have anything of your liking. From delicious pancakes to yummy eggs to oats and crepe with a big helping of fruits.  The food is tAsty and fresh.  The service is also very good. Oh and for those to whom it matters the chicken is halal."}
{"text":"The food is great here, but I really love for them to open at least for early dinner.  I would come here more often if they don't close so early. Service is great and friendly, but I think I am allergic to something at the booths, every time I am seated there, my nose stuff up and my eyes are itchy by the end of the meal.  (it happens to me at another Cora also, so I think is the material they used for all their booths)  It's good for a big breakfast/brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"Barely warm, small serving size, and bad service. Lineup at the door because they didnt have enough servers.  Had been a while since we had been to Cora's, and will be a long while before we are back. Probably go to a different one before going back to this one."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday during the holidays. Took forever to get coffees and even to place an order. Very slow service. Seems really understaffed, both at the tables and in the kitchen. But the staff were very friendly. The location on Yonge St. And Elgin Mills is a better location."}
{"text":"I generally don't come to this location, as it's insanely busy, and I can drive to the downtown one that isn't busy. But we were meeting friends here at 9:30 so figured it would be safe. And it was! So note to people! Do before 10am!   It's the same as all Cora's...delicious!!! Not sure what all to say as I have reviewed the other locations. The food is great, service is good and reasonably priced. Steve and I both had the fruit cocktail, coffees and a meal each and it was $42 with tip."}
{"text":"Today's visit is worth five stars. I do know however that Coras can be inconsistent.  Party of two, we ordered 2 coffees, 1 strawberry-banana smoothie. Both fresh and delicious.  Ham-Egg-Cheddar Panini & Breakfast Poutine (Added two eggs) these were also quite delicious.   My number one beef with Coras is the lack of fresh fruit. They push fruit very hard on the menu and often it is not fresh.  Service was quick, our server in particular was very polite. Bussing of tables was also prompt. We arrived at 9:30am when service was not as busy."}
{"text":"The food quality is amazing as always. The service needs to come back to what is was before. Clean restaurant. The price is a little above average but, the food is amazing.  The quality of food is second to none. After so mamy years they still do it right. Scrambled eggs were just right in its texture; not too dry and not too soggy. The sausages had enough softness for the bite. These are two classics that most places mess up on.  I ordered two separate dishes from the same class of food and did not see the difference from one to the other. The servers were more caught up in humour and having fun rather than getting orders right.  There was a 10min wait time during Saturday brunch. The restaurant was clean and the host greeted us with a smile considering the fact that she was extreamly busy.  Cora is a little above average in price compared to many all day breakfast restaurants. However, the food has always been amazing."}
{"text":"We usually have okay service at this location but did not have a good experience this past weekend. We were seated quickly and our order was taken in a timely manner, however it took a long time for our food to arrive. While we were waiting for our food we noticed the owner or manager being condescending and rude to his workers which wasn't pleasant to witness. He seemed to be a very hands-on manager as he took it upon himself to help wipe and set tables. I'm not sure if this was something he should be doing as I witnessed him licking his fingers as he placed napkins on a table. I realize that the licking of ones fingers is a habit some people have when they're passing or sorting out sheets of paper but it's VERY unsanitary. Someone will be using that napkin and it has some of the manager's spit on it!!  After waiting more than 40 minutes we decided to ask the manager/owner if there was something wrong in the kitchen. We didn't want to blame the waiter. He explained that it takes a long time to prepare their meals because they need to present them properly. We were waiting more than 45 minutes at this point! A few minutes after our inquiry, our food, along with the dishes for the other tables around us came out at the same time. The manager/owner then came by and explained to us that it takes time to make the plates look good for us.....**yeah, yeah, whatever.....Just let us eat in peace because we were now famished and don't want to hear any more excuses!** Part of our meals were cold. My crepe was not hot and the strawberry sauce on my son's pancakes were dried onto the plate. It was obvious that our meals were not freshly cooked and had been sitting around for a while. This is not acceptable at all. We decided not to complain about the food so we ate our meals and left with second thoughts about coming back to this location. There are a lot of other breakfast options in the area with better and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Entrees are okay but use to be better  Sometimes stuff is cold by the time it arrives and bacan is like leather  I try to order the safe bet stuff so I won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We've been to a few other locations in the area and this one seems to be the slowest. The first time we we there we had to wait almost an hour for our food. We went back a few times afterwards and experienced the same, if not slower, service. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands avoid this location.  Food quality  is same as other locations when we finally got it."}
{"text":"power outage been here 20 minutes and no breakfast wow looks like we are going to leave soon."}
{"text":"While my two kids love breakfast joints, as it is our Saturday tradition,  they aren't big fans of cora's, they hate waiting in line,  as does anyone, so, unless you make reservations, you'll be waiting in line, and when you've got two kids like me,  lines aren't very fun."}
{"text":"This would be 5 stars but for the huge lineups virtually all of the time.  I ordered the 1990's Harvest which consisted of an egg, bacon, a massive pile of fresh fruit and a French toasted cinnamon-raisin brioche. Absolutely delicious and extra props for having turkey bacon and providing a nice medley of fruit beyond the cantaloupe and honeydew served at other establishments. The portion size is massive and try as I might I could not finish it. When you figure that I was so full that I didn't eat anything again until late that evening, it is good value for money as well."}
{"text":"We came here on a double brunch date for new years day, so it was considerably busy even though it's a smaller place. We were seated pretty quickly (10 min)  and promptly ordered our coffees (which tasted pretty bad to be honest :P but enough cream and sugar will make anything taste decent). I got the Cora's special, and my friends got the spinach omelette and rosemary Sunday. My friend found more than one dark gross hair in her food but they took care of it, but it made all of us have to check every bite and grossed us all out. That's why as much as I love Cora's I had to give this location 3 stars. Considering how well they handled the situation I'd probably be back because it is a convenient location for a change instead of driving to Dufferin and Steeles"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in a business. Yesterday was my birthday and I always come to Cora's so I trusted them to take care of us on my special day. Everything went wrong. Our server was abrupt from the start. I am usually served by Paula who had JUST left as we walked in! I was already willing to go somewhere else at that point because she's the only server I would trust not to f*** up my birthday brunch!  One of my party members has a serious gluten allergy, and initially we were pleased to learn about their gluten sensitive menu (***APPARENTLY GLUTEN SENSITIVE  GLUTEN FREE!***) How does that make any sense?! If they had a peanut-free menu but the server keeps telling you that your meal may have come in contact with, or contains peanuts, would you feel safe eating their food? Me neither!  I ordered the lovely chicken salad and specifically asked for no tomatoes and I had tomatoes in it. When I told the server she took my grapefruit juice off the bill total. Thanks but the problem wasn't with the grapefruit juice. In fact, the juice was the only thing they got right this time!  We all got our meals except for my gluten-allergic sister, who sat there watching us eat with an almost kid-sized smoothie that was $4. I felt ashamed that I even brought my guests here on my birthday and felt especially angry that my sister had to sit there watching us eat. Eventually she made the decision to go order lunch to go next door at Kavkaz like I wanted to! $9.95 for a whole freshly made meal! And it was absolutely delicious and the service way better, and just on the other side of Cora's walls.  Long story short, I would've considered returning if it wasn't for the fact that they ruined my birthday from the start."}
{"text":"The menu is colorful, the prices fair, the food is good and the servers are friendly and reasonably fast considering how packed this location becomes. The coffee is not first rate but competes closely to what you would expect at Denny's or Ricky's. So really - what's not to like? The experience.   To begin there is almost always a wait to get inside; a line of at least 20 minutes. Once you are finally seated the tables are closely packed and the seating is cramped. The noise level can be a bit intense as well. There doesn't seem to have been any effort made to dampen the sound in any way. The ambiance and noise reminds me more of a Stampede breakfast in an airplane hangar than anything else.  If you are willing to trade away comfort and the ability to carry on a conversation with the people at your table for a good meal, good service and average coffee - Cora's will make you happy. For me, the trade-off isn't worth it. It's just not my kind of place"}
{"text":"Our server Fabianna was excellent keep it up! The food...that's a different story. My bf's banana chocolate French toast was undercooked and soggy. The bacon is not good at all it reminds me of McDonald's bacon, the kind you put in the microwave. I don't know if it's the cook that sucks or because Cora's is just a shitty chain restaurant now."}
{"text":"Food sensitivity alert! I strongly urge you to be ware of this location! Although this place offers a gluten sensitive page on their menu, which means there are items in the menu which you should be able to order from, (with fine print targeted at celiac suffered- which I made clear that I was not) the waitress will refuse to take your order and will leave you sitting there while the rest of your group sits and enjoys their meals! From first impression to the very last, this place was a zero! The staff is miserable and unprofessional with no greeting at the door, with us having to fetch a Member to be seated, to the moment you pay and leave, they have such hatred for simply existing there, it will certainly make the customer run for the door or shall I say next door! Where they have wonderful food, service and ambiance. My family and I are regulars at the 'Cora' chain restaurants. This was my first time at this run down location, with my family. We were completely drawn back by the rude staff, as soon as we entered. The place was nearly dead, and yet so messy and in cared for.  The place looks poorly maintained, the tables who have finished eating and were long gone were cluttered with dishes and trash on the tables, even once the place wasn't busy at all! Including us there  were 4 tables at the time. I made multiple attempts ordering front their so called 'gluten sensitive page' which was clearly created by head office. The waitress refused to take my order and claimed to be afraid to take a risk! After long and very embarrassing negotiating, we had concluded that I will not be eating at this location ever again.  Not only have I tried ordering from the gluten sensitive page, she was not able to confirm or the knowledge that the staff and the kitchen are prepared and/or trained as they should be to prepare the food properly and check the ingredients in certain premade items such as bacon.  I later tried yet again to order a gluten free sandwich, (which was simple enough since they had the bread and other items) which she made no attempt to accommodate, when she asked me if I would like my sides to be the soup or dessert bread, I replied once again explaining that both of those items are not safe for a gluten allergy and I would like to substitute for fruit salad.  She went on telling me that they do not serve or make fruit salad. I later pointed out on the menu that ALL their items come with fruit salad, clearly she was not aware of what fruit salad even meant. And after showing her pictures like to my 3 year old, she still refused to accept and acknowledge that I was correct. And not some uneducated fool off the street. As she insisted on treating me, a 30 something professional, a mother of 2, but yet with a young face and younger siblings along with me. In the end she refused to substitute any items  for some fruit. After all the crap I've already experienced, that should have been the least she could have done! Not only substitute but perhaps offer it 'on the house' After this embarrassing and annoying situation I confronted the waitress in private, as calmly and professionally as possible. I explained that if you do offer a gluten-free page, (from head office). At a chain restaurant.  Not only should they I compadre but also be trained properly and it was not her place as a waitress to make an executive decision, and leave a customer sitting there hungry while the rest of the group ate!!!  Mind you: I have eaten from other locations, there should not be such an issue where I am so put on the spot and and later talked about with other staff and got embarrassing looks from all the members.  The manager, well there was no manager  he/she was not even present or at least made themselves as absent as could be! and the kitchen manager refused to exit to come out and speak to me in person. Long story short this place is a complete joke and I will never step foot in it again!  I would strongly recommend some proper training, not only in food safety, customer service, but also proper interviewing would help, before hiring a bunch of dead beat miserable, un knowledgable 'staff' and out the rest in the back to take out the trash!  P.s good luck if you would like to order to arrive at a timely manner and as you've ordered it!"}
{"text":"I was on the fence about trying Cora's because of their reviews but I loved it there! The service was good, I never had to ask for a water refill once. And the food was really yummy, with big portions"}
{"text":"After reading some of the comments here we were reluctant to try this location but we are so glad we did.  Service was awesome and food was even better.  I had the oatmeal with fruit which in some restaurants is instant but not here. Fully cooked with cream, maple syrup and other fruits.   Highly recommend this location.  It was very busy yet service was excellent and food was served quickly."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and am less than impressed.  The service is ok, my coffee cup was never empty but the menu is limited in my opinion.  I eventually settled on the mushroom and brie eggs benedict and although my eggs were supposed to come out medium, they were under.  The benny itself was edible but I wouldn't order it again, the potatoes that accompanied it were decent but again, not awesome.  I don't know what but it's lacking something."}
{"text":"I went to this location a few month ago.  We had to wait over an hour to be seated. We did have a big group, so we were sitting there watching all the smaller parties (who came after) go ahead in front of us until essentially breakfast/lunch time was over and new people stopped coming in.  I got a waffle and it wasn't great because the fruit was not completely defrosted.  I generally try to be understanding about these issues, and hopefully (for them) this is not typical. If you are planning a trip to Cora's - AVOID LARGE GROUPS."}
{"text":"Cora's Breakfast within a community of Italian restaurants and when we came here on a weekday noon hour it was just PACKED but we got there right in time to see a table for 4 get cleaned and we hounded it as the standard procedures.  Cora's menu is AWESOME especially for those that are vegetarians or fruitarians or inbetween.  The service here fast and friendly with instant coffee refills but smiles are not readily available, nonetheless we came here for Breakfast and the SUNSHINE bright happiness decor that gets us away from the sad dark space we call our Office.  Cora's is my Brunch go-to place whenever I want a full PINT of variety fresh fruits at a reasonable value along side my normal western Egg, Sausage, Toast breakfast.  I'm not a fruity person by any means, so if you have family members or friends that are the same then they will also enjoy the fruit here because of the presentation and color contrast that make it an experience rather than old boring fruit.  I've had the Peggy's Poached before but I'm not a fan of Cottage Cheese for breakfast, so this time I had the 1990's Harvest which is an amazing Egg, Bacon, Cinnamon Raison Brioche with a MOUNTAIN of fresh fruit.  It definitely gave me a good boost of energy ready to start my day.  When we went up to the register to pay we realized it was 1 o'clock and most of the restaurant was CLEARED of patrons but we wondered where the cashier was as we waited around 5 minutes blocking off the entrance/exit hoping to pay and rush back to our Month-End tasks."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by many locals and in a chain of restaurants in eastern Canada that specializes in breakfast.  We went to this on with a friend of ours while were in town on vacation.  Place is very busy and food ends up mediocre because of it.  We waited about 20 minutes for our table.  Service was seemed routine as the waitresses darted from table to table at just about the right times you need them.  Food service however, is on the slower side due to the volume.  The food looks good on the menu and price are reasonable or a little above.  We had the eggs benedict, an omelette type dish and a brioche dish.  The fruit was fresh and the breads were good.  The eggs, well, were over cooked and the potatoes were just okay.  Overall, it's just another breakfast place.  Would go back if in a pinch but totally underwhelmed expectations."}
{"text":"Welcome from Damian, an excellent waiter improves service quality at Coras. The best place you can have breakfast if you care about health eating, December 16, 11:00"}
{"text":"They do the coolest thing with the fruit!  As we came in, I saw a plate of sliced strawberries cut up and pieced together to look like a peacock.  The waitress was really sweet and attentive.  Got the spinach and cheese omelet with hollandaise sauce.  Delicious.  They have quite the variety...Crepes, fruits, oatmeal, burrito omelets...The friends that took us said they had never been disappointed with a dish."}
{"text":"One Of My All Time Favourite Breakfast Place. I Don't Dare To Go On A Weekend. Weekdays Are Usually Pretty Good To Get In Quickly.   I Don't Eat Pork So I Stick To My Usual Dishes And I Enjoy Them Every Time! Spinach & Cheese Omelette And The Strawberry Waffle.. Mmmm.. But I Must Warn You They Are Huge Portions! So I Always Get A Takeout Box.  Service Is Good.. Depending On Who You Get... Overall A Nice Place."}
{"text":"Found my midday midweek meal to be great!  Service was fast and super friendly. I realise the time and day of week I enjoyed were definitely off peak, but it seems like staff and hostess were working in unison to get tables turned and food out hot and fast!  Food as always was quite good and the combination of fresh fruit and great breakfast items was a great way to enjoy a meal!"}
{"text":"After a few days of enduring crappy hotel breakfasts I complained to the client and was told about Cora's. Next time I'm in Mississauga I'll be there regularly. The service on a Thursday morning was prompt and efficient, my coffee cup was  kept full and the panini crepe was original and very tasty with an abundance of delicious fresh fruit on the side."}
{"text":"There seems to be quite the demand for a homestyle breakfast joint that unlike other greasy spoons, is more family friendly.  I get it, i get it.  I tried Cora's just out of curiosity really, it's been receiving rave reviews.    I ordered my usual, pancakes.  I love pancakes, and any breakfast opportunity I get, pancakes are my numero uno choice! The pancakes are HUGE, HUGE I tell you! I don't think I could have finished half of them, even if I wanted to. Got a pour-bottle of real maple syrup and we were off to the races.  To tell you the truth, the pancakes weren't that great. Firstly, they weren't hot. Secondly, they were a little flavourless.  The fruit on the side, though a nice added touch, it was already too much food as is.    I'm not sure if I'd ever go back to Cora's... I heard their bagel sandwiches are pretty good, so maybe that was my biggest flaw.. I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"just giving props to my local cora's.  this is the only place for breakfast in brampton.  basically everything on the menu is top notch.  i personally recommend the cora's special even though i can never finish.  the only bummer is waiting in line but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Upon entering I could only notice the tacky decor and crap plastered along the walls.   Being my first time here and seeing as there was no host to greet us, we decided to find a place to seat ourselves.    Stepping over the threshold and looking into the first vacant booth, a disgruntled  employee rudely told us that we had to wait to be seated.     Once seated and having a chance to look at our menu, a miserable woman introduced herself as our server.  Great!  Needless to say I ordered my eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast and coffee and did enjoy it.  It did however make me wish I was at the diner near my house having the same meal.     This place made me feel like an uninvited guest, and seeing as we paid to be here... I find it unsatisfactory and have no intention of revisiting that experience.   People working here should realize that they are working in the service industry and perhaps should seek employment elsewhere if they can't handle it."}
{"text":"So after shopping with my cousin at Market Mall on a Sunday morning and getting packed for my flights back home to Los Angeles, my cousin and her parents decided to take me here for brunch. I've had crepes in LA before but Japanese style, sweet and savory. When I walked into the mall from the parking lot the line was really long! Waited about a good 20 to 30 minutes to get seated.  My cousin and I ordered the Bobby Botton which was an omelette inside a crepe. I chose an omelette that had everything in it, but forgot what it's called but it had a \"10\" in it. The Bobby Botton came with potatoes and was a huge portion. I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie. The smoothie was fresh and thick and very refreshing with a piece of carambola \"starfruit\" as garnish. Although the line was a bit long, I believe it is totally worth it and the atmosphere and menu are very appealing to kids. The price is definitely worth it and will be here again when i'm in the Calgary area."}
{"text":"Cora is always a 'go-to' restaurant for breakfast. I love being able to eat a complete breakfast during lunch time.   I ordered the special of the month: Egg White Delight. A egg white omelette with onions, mushrooms, spinach, goat cheese, and served with fresh fruits.  Service was very friendly. I was seated within 3 minutes. My waitress was able to refill my coffee three times even though I could see she was very busy with other tables.   One thing to mention is the map view on Yelp is wrong: the restaurant is just north of Airport road and NOT west of Queen St.  I took one star off only because the creton was a little bit soggy and flavourless, and the beans were cold.    Next time I should try the Beef Panini-crêpe! Looks so good!"}
{"text":"So Cora's was introduced some 25 years ago in Quebec, and finally after the long wait we are now so gracious to accept Cora's delicicous breakfast offerings! I have been to the Markham location on several occassions, and Queen St in Toronto. There is however a brand new opening in Pickering for those east enders looking for the best breakfast in the City! It seems that it takes me the same amount of time to figure out what I am going to eat, as it does to actually eat the meal. There are so many great choices, from Cora's Special - Eggs, Ham, Sausage, Home Fries to an absolute incredible Omelete - Im a bacon and chedder type of guy! In addition to the great portion sizes, every Cora meal comes with super-sized garnish of fresh fruit! Im talking strawberries, cantalope, and jumbo sized grapes! The menus is incredible, there are kids portions, and and ubandance of watering smoothie selections. Service is average, but the food makes up for any lack luster preformance by the wait staff. **Goodlife members receive a free smoothie on certain days, check your goodlife fitness card for details**"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant that is beautifully designed and has amazing, fresh food. The service was friendly and quick! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service but can be short staffed sometimes ! Either way worth a go for just the food ::)"}
{"text":"Cora's is coras. All of them are exactly the same. I usually prefer not to come here, but I was kidnapped into missisauga and had to come here for breakfast.  As usual, all the items were identical to other locations.   My thoughts: calm down on the fruit fashion and maybe lower their prices. If im spending almost 20 dollars on breakfast, that's an issue.  I hot the construction breakfast. Eggs x 3 with bacon and sausage. nothing special. All the fruit they used were not in season, so they sucked."}
{"text":"Hmm, where to start. Their staff are rude! We had a waitress that was complaining why we changed tables because it will make her walk more!! The way she spoke to us when we were changing tables was very rude and my friend felt embarrassed. Also she was rushing us when we were ordering, and when we asked for few minutes she just stood by the table and we had to pick randomly.  Their food is bad too. All 4 of my friends were complaining about the taste of the eggs! BLT sandwich had 2 bacons only!!!! I ordered Theo' Omelette and it tasted very bland. I think the only thing that was okay is the chocolate milk :D  All in all, this was the first time and would be the last time we'll ever go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"It is late so I will keep this one short. I went here with a friend this weekend and it was only a mild step up from Phils. We decided at the time to over look some of the issues with the food but upon returning home and sitting down to write this I decided to check out their website. You see, like most times I eat, I ate a lot of food that morning. I ordered two breakfasts, much to the servers surprise and easily downed them both. Seeing that it was Super Bowl Sunday and I was eating all day I thought it would be fun to tally up my calories for the day. Well their website does not have that info but they do have an online comment card. So naturally I filled it out, well low and behold I received a phone call today from the owner, I will be calling her back tomorrow and will be writing an updated review based on that call. My current scoring for Cora's is based on food quality but I suspect that the phone call will raise the score based on customer service. I was impressed that they called and look forward to sharing with them our concerns about the food.  On a positive note the wait time was quick and the service was just what we needed that morning."}
{"text":"UGH.... why do my friends ALWAYS insist on getting cora's whenever we want to grab some breakie!?! Please enlighten me because cora's is one hell of an overpriced breakfast place. I will literally bring you back to my house and MAKE you bacons/sausages/pancakes whatever, if it saves us $11 each -_-  Okok, I'm not gonna deny it is pretty damn satisfying to have someone cook you breakfast in the morning. My friends and I like going after we're done working an earlybird shift (5am-9am) It's pretty relaxing even though we look like hobos. (if you see us, don't be alarmed!)  We all like getting the 'construction' - probably because it's mostly meat. Bacon... yum. But if you think about it.. it's literally just bacon, sausages and fruit. I CAN DO THAT. I can never understand why it's so damn expensive.   There's a lot of variety in the menu, but the food quality is mostly average. This cora's is hella booked during weekends so don't even try.. it's not worth it.  The workers here during the weekdays are not competent and came asking if we were ready to order after not bringing us a menu even though we've been sitting for over 10 minutes. We were too tired to wave him over, even though he was near the kitchen area chatting it up.  Meh, avoid. Unless your friends must drag you to go."}
{"text":"Great stuff, great menu, great breakfast!!!! Love the crepes and the huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on our way to Niagara. Service was friendly, food was OK. I liked that they seem to include some sort of fruit with all breakfast plates. (My omelette came with a slice of pineapple and a strawberry).  They had the cutest sign by the door, something like: \"Please allow us the pleasure of accompanying to your table\"... you know, instead of the usual \"Please wait to be seated\"...  Prices seemed a little higher than US counterparts... if this is comparable to IHOP an Denny's."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  There was a fairly long lineup when we arrived. The decor here reminds me of a daycare or play school.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive even though the restaurant was extremely busy. She even had time to check upon us twice and came running to our table to replace a dropped knife.  My 10 Star omelette was perfectly seasoned but the combination of the ingredients were a bit confusing to the palate (diced bits of bacon, ham, bologna, sausage, frankfurters, spinach, red and green peppers, green onion, mushrooms, sliced onions, Cheddar cheese).  The bell peppers and sliced onions were only cooked to tender crisp (they weren't raw, but they were still crunchy) and the cheese on top of the omelette was only half melted (please see photo).  I also couldn't taste the egg. The potatoes tasted fine but some wedges were a bit mushy.  However, the fruit (cantaloupe slice, pineapple and strawberry) was very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Colorful  Cleanliness: Clean Constructive criticism: Lower the prices. We are eating fruit & eggs, not caviar. Cuisine: Breakfast Facilities: Need more attention. Low paper Towel and one stall, no toilet paper. Food: Nothing special. Average quality. Coffee tasted burnt, and food doused in canola oil. Fruit was displayed nicely. Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Not returning/recommending Parking: Private  Portion Sizes: average Price: over priced Service: could stand to be more friendlier Selection: basic Type of Meal- Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner: Breakfast"}
{"text":"Dropped by today for a quick brunch.  This visit everything had gone perfectly. Our server was responsive and polite, the spinach omelet I ordered turned out wonderful. I was in and outta there less than 35 minutes.   Ive been to this location before, my last visit was terrible (1.5yrs ago), my food was cold and my buddy's meal didn't come until I had almost finished mine.   Lookin forward to try their strawberry crapes next time sooooon. The customers next to me had me convinced."}
{"text":"We went for my mother'a birthday today, and we seated within 10 minutes. The server, David, was attentive and cordial. Please note that there are no discounted options for the birthday person.   The food was generally good, including the smoke salmon Benny & my wife's western omelette. Each came with fruit and greasy potatoes quarters. My mom had a fruit crepe  which looked ok, and was quite sizeable. My son ordered the one egg from the menu, which was laughable in that it was a small scramble with a piece of bacon (no bread on the side).   What is also stunning is that you pay extra for coffee, over $7.00 for three coffees when ordering a full meal. The prices are disproportionate to other comparative breakfast places in the area. My review of Steve's a few weeks back  attests that you can get a reasonable meal with coffee included. It's almost offensive to pay that much for coffee when other breakfast places include it in the cost of the meal. I have attached a snap of the bill, which was a numbing $60.00 for the 4 of us for brunch.  Overall the quality of food and service rates a three out of five, but definitely not to be a regular joint."}
{"text":"Not a serious breakfast place unless you like crepes.   For simple bacon and eggs, you get two eggs, sausages, toast and home fries for $11, compared to Wimpy's' or Sunset's 3 eggs for $8.   Im sure the entire table surface had been wiped with a cola infused rag for that sticky \"non-slip\" effect.  Also, half of the sausages had turned bad.   The staff is very friendly, but that's where it ends.  Needs work!"}
{"text":"Forget the traditional breakfast. Bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns and coffee is not what Coras is about. Expect instead a plate mounded with fruit, crepes, cretons (sort of a meat paste) and other non-traditional breakfast items.   Based out of Quebec, this is quite unlike the usual western style breakfast. It's as unusual as Italian sushi or French BBQ. But it is good, filling, and different.   The interior is quirky in a cartoon sort of way, unlike the usual vinyl chairs and plain walls of Daybreak or Sunset Grill. Everything about this place is different.   I've had several items on the menu, and most of them come with a mass of fruit and melon that leaves you stuffed. Some crepe dishes have the usual thin crepe, but there is also a side crepe that is thick, heavy and doughy tasting-not my fave. So some egg dishes come with the crepe instead of toast, unless you order toast as an extra.   Weekend mornings will always leave you waiting, blended with the traffic jam of patrons trying to pay and leave, colliding with the incoming lineup. Organization is not their strong point, but if you don't mind spending the premium price, it's a good alternative spot for breakfast meetings."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big fan of Cora's, a group of us came here for lunch last week.   As always, if eggs benny is on the menu, I simply must try it! I opted for the asparagus and swiss cheese eggs benny.  The presentation was great and for the most part, the flavour was good. I did find though that the cheese gave the English muffins more of a gooey texture instead of crisp and toasted and the hollandaise sauce had started to separate.   There was, however, a fabulous selection of fruit served with my eggs which really rounded out this dish.   Service was quick and friendly and overall, we had a great time. I just find that Cora's is a tad overpriced and I've had way better eggs benny for way less.  Not worthy of a 'Meh, I've had better' two star but since I can't give a two and a half star, I'll have to up it to a three (mostly because of the service)."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite breakfast place. Service is always very friendly. Prices aren't cheap but food portions are very fair. Never have to wait for a table only issue is the food is never very hot but overall love coming here and always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the low star rating, honestly. We came for breakfast on a Sunday and while the place was busy we were seated within 15 minutes. Our server was extremely helpful and on top of things. We had the Gigi, a platter with eggs and turkey sausage, and an egg and cheddar crepe combination with 4 coffees. The food was plentiful and the coffee was flowing and refilled promptly. I loved all the fresh fruit. We have some excellent breakfast and brunch places in Michigan that we frequent so standards are on the high side, and I'd give this a solid 4 stars. I'd say the prices should be lower, and that's my only gripe."}
{"text":"its been awhile since I've been to Cora's and this place is hands down the best place to go for breakfast. I love the fruits and of course, the meal itself.. am so full every time I come here that I dont go for lunch sometimes afterwards.  Unlike the other branches of Cora, this place is quiet but has a steady flow of customers. I personally like that. And when it does get busy its not too \"circus-y\".. I mean, trust me, the other branches felt like it. haha."}
{"text":"We didn't hate Cora's but we didn't love it either. Our usual order to compare to other similar restaurants is the eggs benedict which was... good. Nothing to complain about though. If this is a conveniently located breakfast place for you then you'll do fine. If you have to travel to get here or wait in line to get in it may not be worth it."}
{"text":"Just like any other cora's this place is busy, clean with good food. So why the 2 star?? It boils down to customer service. I have a 1yr old so we order off the kids menu. Scrambled eggs and bacon. We asked if we could switch the bacon to turkey bacon... you would think a simple switch would be easy since you can do that with the adult menu.  Apparently not ....  we were willing to pay for the difference but we weren't able to make a simple switch  It seemed like the manager who was running the show was more interested in people coming and going instead of servicing their current people."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my birthday brunch. Unfortunately we got molded toast and that was gross!!!! Make sure you guys check your bread before eating it! Otherwise, everything else was pretty standard. Breakfast poutine and smoked salmon benedict was good. Did not like their savory crepes though. Service was ok."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and got the black forest crepe. It was really good :) not too sweet and the tart cherries were great (not maraschino cherries). The English cream tasted a bit like yogurt rather than vanilla cream, but I've never had any before so I'm not quite sure what to expect. The service was great! All of the staff were very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Overall, the food was good but some of it was a bit pricey for what it was (like the fruit dishes)."}
{"text":"I'll never understand how hard it is to just do the basics right, I am not a fussy man nor a particularly cultured one but my gosh there's a dearth of decent eating establishments (see my recent reviews).   Just had Lunch here so here's the rundown;  - Place is half empty, nice server but no lunch menus so i go fetch them myself as the server had vanishesd - Took the server 20 minutes to take our order - Food took a SOLID half an hour to arrive, I mean really we ordered two basic sandwiches and a coke - One plate received salad instead of potatoes, other plate got the salad that was ordered but the plate was clearly sitting under a warmer for a LONG time and the salad was wilted and hot - Sandwiches were quite good, hence the two stars - Server took forever to come back and bill us - We sit there for another 15 minutes waiting and it's finally noted that we have to pay at the cash on the way out not at the table - Cue massive line up at the cash  Madness. It's two sandwiches and two cokes at a reasonably quiet time, how hard can it be?"}
{"text":"Cora's seems to be the brunch place of choice for many couples and families in the 'burbs. I totally understand why. It's a bright clean atmosphere, which makes it fun to get up and head over to, when all you really want to do is roll over, and hit the 'snooze' button. Personally, I find the decor a little sterile and character-less. Cora's is a med-scale brunch chain geared towards families.   I find Cora's largely overrated, and I'll tell you exactly why. The breakfast entrees, although very attractive to look at are far from spectacular once you get a mouthful. I am a huge breakfast/brunch person (if I can pull myself out of bed on time on weekends), and my visits to Cora's have never ever wowed me.   The menu choices are all on the high side, and for the price I've had a much better spread at some widely brunched Manhattan hotspots. I also always get the feeling at Cora's that the waitresses are constantly upselling, and service lacks very notably when they haven't succeeded. (I was totally dropped on one 'memorable' occassion, waiting for my bill for about 20 minutes.)  I know there are better breakfast spots in Markham, but I'm still keeping my eyes and mind open for 'the one'."}
{"text":"-Front of the house-   Arrived at Cora's at 10:12am Was seated promptly Ordered at 10:16am Food arrived at 10:36am Haven't seen my waitress since the food has arrived it's now 11:00am  Waitress arrives with the bill didn't ask if we wanted it split or even if we wanted it period.    -Back of the house-  Ordered eggs bennadict (ham)  Came cold Hollandaise was fairly good.  Eggs poached perfectly.    18.53 later. Not very satisfied. Gonna go find something else to eat."}
{"text":"I came here on Family Day and it was definitely a full house. I was extremely happy that the line moved quickly and I got a booth seat within 10 minutes waiting in line that was all the way out the front door. The staff is always friendly and quick with their service.  I always order the Cora's special which is my favourite because there's a little bit of everything and I am very satisfied and full at the end of every meal. Today was even better because I finished everything on my plate. I usually don't. My favourite item would probably be the potatoes! But their meals are always refreshing which I love.   I rarely go here but I know I will always return because the service is friendly and prompt and you cannot go wrong with breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I tried to have breakfast here two weeks ago on a Sunday morning. I wasn't at all surprised at the huge lineup considering the buzz that this franchise has generated. Because of the wait my family and I decided to eat elsewhere.  I returned today on a cold wintery Friday morning. There was a line again but it was far shorter. We were seated within ten minutes and were immediately served coffee. The staff were very friendly and quick to come to our table throughout our meal.  The menu looked really exciting and we marveled at the photos of delicious breakfast with heaps of fruit. I ordered the Cora's Special (they put their business name on it, I had to try it). My father ordered a breakfast panini.  When the food came to the table my father and I both commented to the server, \"It doesn't look like the pictures!\". It really didn't. My meal was very plain looking and was served with one small strawberry and a sliver of melon. The bacon was overcooked, the potatoes were under cooked. The most interesting thing on my plate was a small crepe with a slice of ham and a breakfast sausage on it. Same story with my father's plate. Underwhelmed by the serving of fruit and the crepe wrapped omelette was as plain looking as it was in flavor. We were both thankful that we had ordered some hollandaise sauce on the side. The serving of food in general was enough as neither of us were hungry when we finished our meals.  The price was very reasonable for what we got, but I'm disappointed. I thought this was supposed to be the most amazing breakfast place in all the land. I might return with lowered expectations if it is convenient."}
{"text":"Good fresh, food. Descent breakfast place. Gets busy though so you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"saw cockroach on the wall. I am not happy about that. Nasty!!Never ever going back ."}
{"text":"What is there NOT to love about breakfast food?  Cora's has a very bright and welcoming atmosphere and the staff are extremely friendly, creating a sense of belonging to those who visit.  Their menu is extensive and one has the choice of choosing from their many options (e.g. fruit, omelettes, crêpes, eggs, etc.) Or creating their own breakfast from a choice of sides.  Food is delicious, portions are HUGE, healthy, and keep you satisfied for quite a bit!    My complaints, however, are that the fruit does not always seem fresh.  Prices are on the higher end, too."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast this am. The Brie and mushroom eggs Benny. Yummy. One of my muffins was not toasted and they fixed it right away. Great service and more food than I could eat. Next time I'll share!"}
{"text":"Mmm... Yummy! I'd eat everything there if I could. The food is really great: waffles and omelettes, milkshakes and smoothies... Although the service was slow, and when I say slow it means we waited for almost an hour to get our food.."}
{"text":"I got some sort of super-thin vege omlette and my husband had some very dry chocolate french toast. Overall the ambience and service is lovely but the food doesn't measure up to it at all. I'd rather have dennys any given day."}
{"text":"Oh I want to like Cora's, I really do.  The people that work there are lovely.  The booths are comfortable.  Fresh fruit as a side is a nice touch.  Sigh.  My heart just isn't in it.  For the same amount of money for delicious breakfasts in other Calgary establishments (cough...D*ner D**luxe...ahem....the B***ont Diner) I get what feels like a mediocre breakfast.    The coffee is not very satisfying and I am not even a demanding java aficionado?!  I can never find a menu item that contains all of the things I want in one option.  The portion sizes ARE generous."}
{"text":"Been coming here a few times a year now and honestly, it's not that impressive. The eggs are not cooked particularly special and the whole plate is just wickedly over priced!  Just not worth the money and the wait for food.   I have not had the best service here and I certainly don't find that the negatives it weigh the positives. Just being an honest yelper, I would not recommend this breakfast place. It's nothing special and it costs way more than its worth. It looks pretty but you can't judge everything by its cover."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for basic breakfast fare and the portions suck too. I'd go to my local diner (Stacy Lees) or Flips on Main St before here any day.  Coras is much better in Montreal"}
{"text":"Breakfast isn't bad, it's very filling but I had an issue with the service and the food.  We came here on a weekday and it wasn't very busy.  There was one table that was available in the area but it was still dirty, we didn't want a booth for six.  When we asked if we could get a cozy area in the other room, the hostess went to ask a server who said no the area was closed.  We were moved into another area and it was ok, but one of the tables was wobbly.  When we brought it to the hostess'es attention she said she'd be back to put something under neath.  She never did.  Server wasn't mean but not really pleasant.  We had to ask for refills for tea, whereas the dude beside us automatically got his coffee refilled.  Food arrived warm not even hot.  Food presentation is nice.  Wouldn't come here because of the service and food.  It's a nice concept but they dropped the ball on this one."}
{"text":"I love Cora's! I love how everything you order on the menu comes with fresh fruit!  If you go on the weekend you will have to wait to get seated so I go during the week when they are not as busy.   Its a breakfast/Lunch place, they are not open all day long. I have been to Cora's in New Brunswick as well and they seem to be more \"fast-paced\" then places I have been to in Ontario. The only problem I have with this restaurant is I find them to be very slow even when they are not busy..."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, Awesome menu, Awesome staff. Kale Mango Smoothie is a must. This is a must if you spending time in Markham, ON"}
{"text":"Was waiting over 20 minutes to get in even though there was only 4 people ahead of us. Then sat down and waited another 35 minutes to get food. The food was ok. Definitely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"One of many around the GTA. Nothing special about this location other than a busy parking lot, cold potatoes and fairly dirty restrooms. Although my coffee cup was kept full and service noticeably good given the amount of customers around... This won't be enough to visit this location again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to Cora's before, and I usually enjoy the dining experience. Today's visit for me was especially disappointing.  The restaurant was fairly empty upon our arrival. We were seated immediately. Our server was mostly missing in action despite that.  I ordered the veggie skillet and my partner ordered a breakfast platter with various items.   There was a family seated beside us and they ended up ordering and receiving their food before anything had arrived at our table. In fact, that family was finishing their meal as our order was arriving (to give an idea of how long we waited).  The waiter skipped by and said the kitchen was busy. Sure, that's fair. I used to work in the service industry and am pretty understanding about that sentiment. But this was a longer than necessary wait.  My partner's order arrived first, she had asked for a substitution within her order and they made a mistake on that. We corrected it and shortly after, my veggie skillet arrived.   To begin... It's not really a veggie skillet. It's more like a sad platter of a few soggy vegetables hiding a potato party underneath. I ordered potatoes on the side not knowing how potato-y the veggie skillet would be. They should just call it carbo-tato skillet. That would be a better representation of what the dish really is. I really wish I had taken a photo. It looked absolutely dismal.  To top off the veggie skillet there is a  supposed coating of cheese. However on the one that arrived for my order, there were sad bits of burnt cheese sparsely laid out over top of basically mushy-kinda-cold-and-overly-moist potatoes.   Thanks Cora's, but i'll opt for other breakfast serving places the next time around."}
{"text":"Our meal started with cold waffles for our daughter (we went this morning) so we just asked for fresh ones (mind you at 2 quarters of a waffle for $5.75 I thought the expectation was a fresh meal), then I received my 1 pancake with pecans and caramel sauce; cold pancake with refrigerated caramel sauce lol they completely missed the mark for fresh warm breakfast options. Server was nice (this is what happens when you receive bad service you talk about the server being nice). Oh and then the bill came! I paid slightly over $9.00 for 1 pancake, a few pecans and a saucer of caramel sauce which was $3 alone!l     If you want to throw your money away.. Sure try it!"}
{"text":"Can get very busy. Line ups to get a table. Never went back here since I found hair inside my half-cooked omelette. The manager was nice, he wanted to replace my meal but I didn't want anything that came out from their kitchen. They could never cook omelettes right, always runny.  Great staff, but watch what you eat."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had at any breakfast joint! Food is run of the mill, but our server was fantastic. Would come back in a heartbeat and will do--visit ASAP."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant! Staff was overwhelmed when I was there the last few times. I love the blueberry pancakes with the English cream. I always ask for extra cream on the side because it's so good!  :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The decor is the same at every Cora's - creepy barnyard motifs. The waitresses were nice but why so many of them. Four kids in uniform standing around giggling while everyone else worked. I had the brioche with eggs and fruit. The brioche was huge and there is an abundance of fruit. If you want decent eggs and more than just one tired over cooked egg, and decent thick bacon, go elsewhere - frankly go to Sunset."}
{"text":"Most Cora's I've been to has been fairly standard and this one was no different. Had breakfast here before spending the day helping my friend paint his place. Had the Cora's special. Bacon was crisp, sausage was tasty and peameal was good. Hash brown could use a little more time in the pan. Eggs were cooked to my liking. Pancake was fluffy which was a good end to my breakfast. Venue itself was welcoming and overall a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here before, but didn't have much recollection of the breakfast that I had.  Seats were easy to grab - however, it is a Wednesday lunch.  I came here again today and got myself a smoked salmon egg benedict.  I've actually never had an egg benedict before in my life, but GOSH, it was DELICIOUS.  I absolutely loved it!  Not only that, they give you some potatoes and some fruit at the side.  The only problem was that my fruit got into some of the hollandaise sauce, so that wasn't that great.  The service was mediocre.  Our waitress only came by once after we started eating, and it was hard to get her attention when we had to grab the bill.  Other than that, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Service is a tad slow. However, the food was good. My favourite thing to get is the Rosemary's Sunday. It's a bit of everything- pancakes, turkey sausages (yes you can replace your bacon for ham or turkey sausages), fruits, and eggs."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server Johanna was amazing. The restaurant was extremely busy on Sunday, there was about 20 minutes wait for a table but the the food took awhile to arrive."}
{"text":"The food was great, basically the standard that you'd come to expect from a Cora's location, but the service was terrible that I won't consider coming back. We came on a Sunday for brunch and I guess this is when they are the busiest, because even though we arrived at 10:30am it still took us 30 minutes of waiting for get a seat for 2.   We were greeted by a server, but then she sort of just disappeared that we had to get somebody else to come look for her so she'd take our orders. I ordered the Egg Benedict on English muffin and the portion was great. Really large serving and super delicious eggs with loads of veggies arranged perfectly for photo taking...though it still took them like 20 minutes to serve the food. When it came to getting the bill it was hell trying to look for our server again. Btw she didn't come check on us once during our meal and it was somebody else coming over to refill our drinks. Apparently only the server assigned to our table can ring in the bill for us so it was once again more waiting for our server to show up. I'm pretty sure half of the time we spent at the restaurant was just waiting for the server and our food to come.   I understand it's challenging to work during a busy time, but the manager should have known that Sunday brunch is their peak hours and they should hire more servers to fill this shift. Or, I don't know, just make it like an Asian restaurant so that you can call on any server walking by to fill your order to make it more efficient and customer friendly."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you're getting. There are much better places in Vaughan to get breakfast, but this place continues to pack them in. I've been in twice in the last 6 months and while many of the items are unique to Cora's, it has very high prices to reflect it. Service is average...the waitstaff won't knock your socks off with friendly rapport but get the job done."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, I wish we have Cora in the states. They have some health meal choices, if you want something light for brunch, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"Went there today for Saturday brunch, the place was packed and we were seated relatively quickly. The server, however, took a really long time to greet us and take our orders. The food all looked great on the menu, although I am always wary of places that have pictures of their food on the menu. I ordered the 2 eggs, bacon and blueberry crepe plate. Being new to Canada, and being in awe of the French influence I thought the crepes would be a fun choice. They were rubbery, thick and tasteless, however. The blueberries in the crepes had no flavor and the only way I could make them edible is heavily slathering them in jam.  The crepes seemed like they were frozen and reheated. The egg yolks were a faint yellow color and had no flavor. The bacon was alright but my fiancé commented that his potatoes were bland and he had to salt and pepper pretty heavily.  The coffee was decent and my fiancé's smoothie was good, although expensive for the size.  All in all, I would not return, I was really disappointed with the quality of food and didn't even want to finish the breakfast."}
{"text":"It's my 3rd time eating at Cora's - 2nd time at this particular location. It's such a convenient location with easy parking. I love the decorations and ambiance of Cora's. All the smiley suns everywhere make me feel happy :D haha.   I ordered the Cora's special today with coffee. The coffee is bottomless (which is the norm for brunch places) so I'd be upset if it wasn't.. The portions were pretty big! I wasn't able to finish my food. I got a ton of bacon, potatoes, 1 slice of ham, 1 sausage, 1 pancake, 2 eggs, and fruit. The food quality is fine, I wouldn't say it's anything spectacular but it's good.   The service was good.. the waitress was quite diligent in refilling my coffee whenever I was close to done. The only thing is, when we arrived, there was a short line. When it got to us, they told us they were completely filled so we will have to wait a little.. which is fine. Except after waiting 5-10 mins, (and we didn't see anyone leave) they led us in and there were sooo many empty tables. So not sure what the wait was for.... and what they meant by they were completely filled. Other than that, I was happy with the service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fruit is very fresh. Food is delicious.  Staff is fantastic.  Only complaint is the coffee,  would be nice if they would change the brand."}
{"text":"One of the go to places for breakfast when I'm around this area. Food is usually consistent in a pod way. Service while a tad sluggish is still decent. Nice servers. Ambiance is nice as well. Coffee isn't something off the charts though. All it comes down to is the food. Good omelettes, crepes and a nice quantity of fresh fruit that's given with your order. All in all a good experience every time."}
{"text":"Went here once and loved it! The second time we went here we found the service to be lacking and the place was not very clean. Very disappointed. We will not be returning. It grossed me right out. Dirty Windows, the floors were super sticky, as were the tables. Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Been to this location before. It seems to be a hit or miss.  Today I got the \"Undecided\" breakfast which is 2 eggs, bacon ( got sausage instead) and potatoes with a Nutella, strawberry banana crepe.  I was very disappointed, in the food quality, the sausage just tasted odd, eggs were good, very burnt and dry potatoes. And m crepe was yummy.   My boyfriend got the Jo Construction breakfast, 3 eggs, 3 sausage 3 bacon and toast with potatoes and fresh fruit  The fruits was old and dried out  The potatoes were dry and burnt  He said the bacon was good and that his sausages tasted a lot better then mine.   Service was average. And friendly. But didn't really check up on us. at that point it wasn't even worth asking for new food."}
{"text":"Large menu and options with gigantic portion sizes with an accompanying hefty price. Not the best service even though they weren't busy but clean restaurant and pleasant staff. For the price you pay however it seems a bit too much and wasteful. They don't have much flexibility to minimize options."}
{"text":"I went to Cora with my teammates on a weekday at 8am. It wasn't busy at all and despite we forgot to make a reservation, the server was able to move some tables to accommodate our group of 8 people. She was always checking on us to serve us more coffee or whatever we needed. Even if we ordered 8 different dishes, our food didn't take too long.  I had the Cora's special which included eggs, ham, fries, bacon, sausage and fresh fruit. It was very good and filling! Everyone was pleased with their food. We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got an apple cut in the form of a swan with strawberry sauce at the bottom. The server asked us if we wanted separate bills without making a frown when we said yes; we didn't have to pay a 18% of gratuity either for groups of 8 or more people as other restaurants do. I mean, the server deserved the 18% of gratuity but we weren't forced to do it. Since this place is in a shopping mall, there is plenty of parking. I was very pleased with this visit to Cora but I understand it is much busier on weekends."}
{"text":"I like Cora's. They do a lot of things right. Bottomless coffee tastes fine. It's diner coffee all right but it's not watery or tasteless. Menu selection is great. Got the standard big breakfasts with eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, the fruits, omelettes, covered most basis. Atmosphere is very bright, clean, brunchy- suburban style - aka not hipster and not trendy but family style. It's a bit pricey, each dish is about $8-10.   I've tried many things on the menu and I would say everything tastes about a 3/5. Nothing exciting but glad to have them in town."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I like to meet up at Coras for brunch every few Sundays to catch up.  The location at Dufferin and Steeles has gone downhill in cleanliness over the years so we decided to make a switch to the Warden and Hwy7 location this time.  Cutlery thay is not sticky when you sit down is very refreshing.  Once i sat down to wait for my friends i was greeted by my server and offered a beverage to start.  I loved the service.  Topping up my coffee.  Making sure we're okay often but not obnoxiously.  The food was okay.  I had crepes and bacon.  Maybe not the best choice as the crepes were very rubbery like they've been sitting under a heat lamp for a little while but its weird because the food came really quickly.  Maybe I'll try the waffle next time or the omelettes.  Definitely a place I would return to."}
{"text":"always so packed on a weekend morning/afternoon. expect line ups out the door at this location. to avoid the line up, try arriving around 10am. delicious food, a bit pricy but it's worth it. yum yum yum"}
{"text":"I've gone to Cora's before and I must say the novelty of it has worn off a bit. It doesn't seem as whimsical as it used to and the place is just simply a diner. The quality has gone down slightly.  But I will say the food taste hasn't changed too much. Still delicious as the first time I went. I guess the ambiance has changed and it definitely feels like you're in a chain restaurant and not a specialty breakfast place. I would say it's comparable to a Denny's now but with more ffruit and more options.  We also came at a good time ...Christmas eve at 12:30pm and the wait was fairly short (5 mins)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Cora's locations I've ever been to. We only go back because it's 5 mins from home. They just don't make the Sunshine Panini Crepe right. Service isn't always the greatest and is pretty inconsistent most times."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the server was amazing!!! The food however was awful Everything floating in grease Unless you are ordering boiled eggs and dry toast I wouldn't eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Like Denny's but with a fruit explosion with every meal!  A simple no frills breakfast/brunch place, Cora's packs a bunch of fresh fruit with every meal which I love! I had a glass of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with an order of a toasted ham and cheese sandwich topped with slices of honeydew, cantaloupe,pineapples, grapes, watermelon, kiwis and bananas. Dipped in trademark Canadian pure maple syrup! Yum!!  Plus, we were a huge group of 15. Our waitress always made sure to tend to us and with a friendly smile to boot!"}
{"text":"I decided to keep my brunch habit up while in Canada and we headed over to Cora's.    Its true that when you walk in, this place is covered in fruit but luckily, there are breakfast options for those who like savory like me. The menu is very inviting with great photos and seems to be full of hidden pages. Haha.  The prices are a wee bit high for what it is but not awful. I liked how they had so many options across the board from omelets to skillets to waffles to crepes.  They also had great takes on sweet and savory crepes.  I ordered the spinach and cheese crepe omelette, while my relatives ordered the panini-crepe with ham, the eggs benedict and a kids fruit crepe.  We also got lattes, the fruit drink of the day and a kid's apple juice.  My crepe was ok but I didn't taste a lot of cheese and the hollandaise sauce was way too salty.  It reminded me of a salt lick.  The actual texture of the crepe is great.  It's perfectly thin.  I didn't taste the eggs benedict or the panini-crepe but my cousins seemed to like it.  I noticed the apple was brown on arrival though.  For a place that's all about the fruit, I expect more. The fruit crepe was huge and a great deal for $5.  The cream on the fruit crepe is nice and light too.  The latte was ok and the fruit drink of the day was surprisingly good.  The service was quick though kind of eh.  This place is def. A-Ok.  Not much more or less."}
{"text":"Great food , wonderful service. Horrible bacon . Tastes like the microwave stuff. Other than that foods great."}
{"text":"I love Cora's! It's a consistent place to enjoy breakfast and worth the line up wait. Originally from Ontario, I have enjoyed the Cora's locations there but have found the same menus, quality and service at the northland location. On a weekend expect longer wait times but always worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but overpriced for breakfast. The Canadian maple syrup with the pancakes were good, and the fruit was tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Would recommend for an eventful breakfast but definitely not one to be a regular"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time in high school But now I find it to be really oily and standard. Everything u order comes with fruits which is good. The place seems very homey but I didn't find anything here where I couldn't already make at hkme"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous breakfast places, and have come here multiple times.  I have been craving Yoghurt lately and this time I find the Yoghurt bowl really dry.  They refused to add more Yoghurt to my Yoghurt bowl and asked me to buy more instead.  Gees, if I were to buy more,  I would go to Menchies next door where there are way more Yoghurt flavors. They swore by their portions and just refused to budge. It is not about your portions,  but any what your customer experiences that meal based on the presented food.  Just a bit more Yoghurt is not something worth fighting over.  I left very unhappy."}
{"text":"Cora's does breakfast right!  The restaurant has such a cozy, homey feel to it when you walk in. With simple menu drawings on the wall and the courteous staff, you feel so welcomed.  Cora's has so many different options that it may become frustrating, but trust me...you really can't go wrong. We came on 2 separate occasions in three days and I ordered the 1990's harvest and the crepe panini. The 1990's harvest consisted of cinnamon french toast topped with fruit. The cinnamon french toast was just scrumptious and the fruit is always a great touch. Taking a bite of the crepe panini, I definitely found myself saying...winning! Such a creative idea and so tasty!  Where Cora really shines is their presentation...quite possibly the most beautiful plates of food I have ever seen. Order one of fresh fruit menu items and you won't want to take a bite of the food and mess up the beautiful design.   If I lived in Canada, I would definitely become a regular at Cora's!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since my college years when I started going to the Park Avenue location just north of Sherbrooke in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not really my type of breakfast joint..  I prefer the sausage and eggs, steak and eggs, bacon and eggs..Peameal bacon and eggs...   This place's menu is great for yogurt type of breakfast with assorted fruits.. pancakes..   Coffee wasn't all hay great..  Would definitely choose McDonalds over this place any day.. but that's just because I like man food..."}
{"text":"We went to Cora's this morning, it had been a while since we went there. We only had to wait 2 minutes before being seated. I had the choco-choco crepe ( chocolate crepe with Nutella and fruits. ). My wife had the Cora's special. The portions were big and tasty. The waitress was friendly and came around a few times for coffee refill. The price was a bit more but considering the portion size it was fair. Will come back since my wife wants to try the omelettes."}
{"text":"Came here for a business breakfast, so hence, the no-photos thing.  However, I must say that the photos on the menu are exactly representative of what was presented.  Ordered a smoked salmon eggs benny (2 eggs) and the portions were larger than I expected.  Then again, it was about $14, so portion was inline with pricing.  Price for 2 X Eggs Benny + an OJ + a coffee was just under $40.  Also ordered orange juice and a coffee, but no one came around to refill coffee, so I'm not sure if it was bottomless or not.  Usually, free refills for coffee is the standard for these all-day breakfast places, so you may want to check that on the menu.  Service was prompt and friendly!  Location seemed very quiet.  From the outside, I almost questioned whether or not this place was still in operation.  Wouldn't be opposed to going back, but not anticipating my next visit either."}
{"text":"This place cannot accommodate parties of 5 or more very well. The restaurant is layout with a lot of 4 person tables that cannot be pushed together without getting in the way. Seems very poorly payed out.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"After being open for about a week I decided to check out the new breakfast spot in north Whitby... Cora's.  Cora is quite a pretty and comfy spot, with a mix of booths and tables and a nice decor which was spotlessly clean.  The menu is quite varied with a wide variety of omelets, pancakes, waffles and traditional egg and bacon breakfast, however my initial impression was ohh, this looks interesting and tasty, then directly to Wow... Expensive...  Food cost, rent, labour etc are up for all restaurants and I respect the challenges they face, however $10.15 for 3 blueberry waffles (+ beverage) seems high too me and most every breakfast entree was over $10 with coffee extra. Not a good first impression and while it maybe the reality of food costs today, I question the logic of crossing the $10 barrier to greet new customers and a town. (but I also found out this is not up to the franchise owners and comes from head office)  My order was sausage and eggs over easy which arrived with two eggs, two sausages, rye toast and real home fries.   Impressions: coffee took 2 creams to reach a drinkable level and I saw it was Mother Parkers which some like, but not me. The plate looked good at first glance however Sausage was not browned /cooked and I chose not to eat it, which was in contrast to the homefries which were burnt and black in spots and had no seasoning (I left these too) .  Eggs were cooked perfectly and toast a very nice rye with a nice selection of jams.  While I was looking/picking suspiciously at my 2 sausages and the home fries, the server immediately asked if there was an issue and I said they did not seem cooked properly to me and she immediately offered to get new ones, however I said it was ok and that I would prefer not to.  Summary:   Atmosphere: 9/10  Food: 7/10 (my problems were hiccups as other people seemed happy)  Value: 5/10 (sorry...there are much better deals in town)  Service: 10/10 - Especially as the owner made a point of coming over to check on my meal and didnt charge me for it which was fair as I could only eat half of it (FYI I did not ask for this, she offered to do it and I thanked her and shared this review and wished them well)  Overall I would go back and give it another chance due to the excellent service I received and I will try to be more forgiving on the prices. I am also curiuos to see what they offer for lunch)"}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing. Me and my family really enjoyed our meal. Our waiter was the best! Fyi the hot chocolate is to die for!"}
{"text":"One thing that stands out in this place is super friendly and welcoming staff. They're always smiling, very kind, fast to get your order and open to any kind of add-ons to the menu. The service is great. Unlike other Cora's branches, you don't have to line up and wait to be seated and I suppose that's because of the great service too. Food quality is good as expected, fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I am celiac, when this was made aware to the waiter he provided us with a gluten free menu. I have ate at Cora's in Vancouver and knew they had a buckwheat crepe that was okay. I ordered this same item from this location. When it arrived and I took my first bite we realize it was not buckwheat and was in fact their normal flour crepe. The waiter spotted this from across the restaurant and took it to the back to have it remade. When it came back it was not very good, and I was already feeling too nervous to continue to eat. I couldn't finish the crepe, the waiter gave us a mere 50% discount off my meal that I didn't even eat. I would never eat here again as I sustained a full celiac reaction an hour later that I was sick with for days."}
{"text":"Really do not think there is much quality to the food served at this Cora's location.  Based on the three times I've visited the food have been sub par: the fruit salad isn't fresh, the potatoes are not crisp (or evenly browned and the eggs are underwhelming.  I do find the staff friendly, hardworking and consistent.   Dishes seem to be cooked without passion our care for the presentation, compared to my initial visit in downtown Toronto a few years back I'll say this one needs some work."}
{"text":"When this location first opened up, my brother and I were super excited because a friend of ours has recommended their south location but we live in the very NW, and never had the chance to give it a try.  We went several times with different parties on different occasions in the first year.  The general experience was quite good with smiling servers and heaps of fruit, making it worth the slightly pricey breakfast and long wait.  If I were to rate this Cora's then, I would've gave it a 4.  Portion sizes are okay depending on how much you eat.  It is okay for me, but not enough for my younger brother.  Prices range from $11-15 for most breakfast items.  Add $3-5 if you want coffee drinks, juice or smoothies.  After not having gone for about a year, my friends and I started visiting again this past holiday season.  The lines were just as long as we remember, averaging about 20 minutes before they could seat a table of 2 on the weekend.  If you have a party larger than 4, expect a long wait.  They also no longer seat your party unless everyone is present.  Unfortunately, I could only give my recent visits a satisfactory rating of about 2 (hence the 3 rating to average it out).  I don't know why but the quality of service and food seemed to have gone down.  Both of my recent visits, service was slow and waitresses just didn't seem friendly or cared about helping us.  We waited about 30 minutes for our food, and not once for either visit did the server come back to refill our drinks even though our glasses/mugs were empty.  We were also given empty bottles of ketchup both times and had to ask for new ones.  On one visit, my meal was supposed to come with a large portion of fruit on the side (taking up about half the plate according to the photo).  When I ordered, I asked them for no melons (I really dislike melons), only to be disappointed that they did not replace the melons with a larger serving of other fruits.  I suppose the melons were supposed to take up a majority of the plate, so I ended up with a good third of the plate empty, with only a strawberry, a few grapes, and 3 slices of apple to make up this \"mountain of fruit\".  Could they not have substituted the melons with maybe some oranges,kiwi, banana, or pineapple?  Guess not.  On a more recent visit, I asked if it were possible to replace the toast with something else.  Instead of offering options (at additional costs if required), or even half an apology, all I got was a hasty \"no\".  Would it be so hard to switch out 2 slices of toast for some breakfast potatoes or a crepe?  Seems like every thing on the menu is take it or leave it, and despite the wide variety of items on the menu, you can't customize an order to have just the combination you want.  Then when our meals arrived, the potatoes and vegetables with our food were both severely undercooked even though it took them 30 min to make it.  My friend's egg benny had really runny and separated hollandaise sauce which ran across the entire plate and drowned her fruit, much to her dismay (she didn't eat some of her fruit because of it).  The strawberries with our order were also too raw, and my grapes were too old.  Pretty much, a lot of things about the experience in general were a let down and we didn't finish our food.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be visiting again in a while.  I don't know if it's bad luck or if they really aren't as good as before, but I will be looking for a new brunch hangout."}
{"text":"Wow is this place BUSYYYY!  I've only been here a few times and they always have a big long line..must be a good sign!  My boyfriend and I went on Saturday around 9AM and there was a bit of a line..maybe 4-5 groups ahead of us.  I think we got lucky because the groups ahead of us were maybe 4+ people and we were only a group of two.  The lady came out and said \"table for two?\" Spence and I kinda waited for the people ahead of us to go but nobody was going!  And she said it once again...\"Oh!...us!!\" ...woohoo! we got to cut the line!  Once we got sat, we were greeted with a lady with a french accent (ooh i love french accents!) and she was very sweet, suggested foods and drinks.  I got the cocktail of the day and Spence got OJ, the drinks are kind of pricey but the food makes everything worth it in the end.  I got the Cora Special (eggs, sausage, crepe, ham, potatoes, bacon and fresh fruit)  Spence got a ham and swiss crepe with Hollandaise sauce and fresh fruit and we shared a strawberry and nutella crepe! (SO GOOD!!)  Everything was really good and filling, the hollandaise sauce was very good, I dipped my potatoes in it!   In the end, we were stuffed so we walked around the mall to make our selves feel better and watch the Cora line get bigger and bigger.  A must try for breakfast/lunch!! They're open 6AM - 3PM."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Delicious food at a good price. Best to go for breakfast. If you go on a holiday it's best to make a reservation because this place can get packed really quick."}
{"text":"WORST Cora's experience ever! The meals were only half size of the pictures showing on the menu. Compared to other Cora's, the food is way under expectations. I went there with my 3 kids which one of them was a baby in the stroller, and we were seated next to the washroom while the entire restaurant was 80% empty. During the entire breakfast, I had to move my chair for people who was going to the washroom. Not mentioned that it took them 20 minutes to refill my coffee. We will definitely NOT coming back!!!"}
{"text":"A good place to eat commercialized breakfast, everything seems like its made in a factory and just cooked on site. Had omelette a couple times and it tasted like it was prepared days ago. Very expensive for what you get. Would way rather go to a family breakfast place."}
{"text":"I can count in one hand how many times I've came to coras. I don't even know why I come back each time. I want to satisfy my craving for breakfast but everytime the meal is always unsatisfying. Over the 5 years I have only witnessed the food quality get worse and worse. Maybe it's this specific coras. But let's just talk about my recent visit. I ordered the coras breakfast which comes with two eggs, bacon, ham, toast, pancake, homefries, and fruits. Home Fries were super dry and in general the meal was just definitely below average. There's so many breakfast joints out there and coras as a franchises doesn't cut it for me. The staff are also super forgetful.... I asked for syrup and peanuts butter 4 times until I finally got what I wanted.... I hate to repeat myself and after my last visit I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"decided to get breakfast with my fiancé. we were both super hungry.   I myself have been to Cora before however not particularly this location. This location by far was the best I have been to. I got my breakfast in a very timely manner, and the waitress was really friendly.   I ordered the gargantuan feast which consisted of 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, peameal bacon, potatoes(I added cheese and caramelized onions for an additional cost), toast and a blueberry pancake (did not finish had to take leftovers to go).   My fiancé ordered the jo construction which was 3 eggs bacon, sausage, potatoes(same as mine, what a copy cat, I know.. lol ) and toast.   both our meals came with some refreshing fruit on the side.   I also ordered the half orange juice/half grapefruit juice which was surprisingly a good balance.   the place was busy, but not crazy busy, there was no wait to get a seat and this was a Sunday Morning at around 10:00ish. The place was clean and the lighting was good.   I would love to have breakfast here again!"}
{"text":"Great food! This is my favourite breakfast spot because of the big variety on the menu. The food is filling and the fruits that come on the side of some of the meals is amazing! Good selection of fruits :) service is okay because it's always busy so servers are quite busy bjt the hosts greet you very quick and we were seated very fast but the food tastes great so that makes up for the so-so service."}
{"text":"Great family place. Perfect for Sunday brunch. There's usually a bit of a line to get in, but it moves pretty quickly. The staff is very friendly and the food is very yummy and big portions."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Cora's in years but decided to go today (Friday) with some work people to celebrate a special birthday. It was pretty empty so we were able to get a booth right away at 1130. They have a special lunch menu on weekdays only from 11am but 3 of us ordered from the breakfast menu. One of my friends ordered from the lunch menu getting the club sandwich and gave it a 3/5 so I would recommend you stick with the breakfast.  I got my usual which is the spinach cheddar crepe omelette with the hollandaise on the side, multigrain toast and fruit. I also had the crepe made with buckwheat (you can also get whole wheat if you wish). It was just as I remembered. Delicious!   Other orders were the 1990s harvest ((cinnamon brioche with lots of fruit) and the Cora's special (eggs, bacon, ham, crepe, toast, fruit, potatoes. Both ladies gave a 4/5 on their breakfasts.   For 4 meals, 3 coffees plus tax and tip came to about 70 bucks.  Good service and good food. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Simple brunch spot.  Came here with a friend because it was nearby. Nothing fascinating, but food was overall alright. The service could be a bit slow.   Won't be back unless in the area."}
{"text":"There is always a line out the door for this place! The food here is good, but it's the service that keeps me coming back here. I usually get the 10 star, but today I got the spinach and cheese omelette and it was just as good. My sister alwaaaaaays gets the eggs Benedictine and has never changed her mind; she absolutely loves it, so I would definitely recommend it as well.  The servers here are great and I would definitely recommend to come here! Apparently there is an early bird menu that's a bit cheaper for those who wake up at 6am.. That's definitely not me though! :p"}
{"text":"Brunch? Count me in! Came here with a HUGE group of friends and they were super accommodating. Our waiter was this really friendly guy who kept joking around and laughing with us.  We got a huge variety of food - pancakes, eggs, omelets, etc. Although their regular brunch options are pretty standard (stuff like eggs tastes the same as any other brunch place) Cora's spices things up by making some really different dishes and combinations! Price is a little on the high side too."}
{"text":"I don't go to Cora's often because they do not really have anything gluten free. However, my fiancé and I did go quite a few times when we lived much closer to one. At this particular location, the owner is amazing. Such a kind man, always made sure we had a nice booth and warm welcome. Some of the waitresses are awesome and some are rude. Luck of the draw unfortunately. We somehow ended up getting a particularly rude one a few times in a row, but we dealt with it by overtipping her - changed her style dramatically ;)  I would always order the spinach and cheese omelet, a side of fruit and tomatoes instead of toast. The first time I ordered this and mentioned my gluten issues, there were crumbs under my tomatoes. My assumption was that they originally put toast, removed it and placed the tomatoes. There was no issue with getting a replacement plate and tomatoes but showed me that they aren't very careful.  Overall the portions are decent. It definitely costs more than your run-of-the-mill breakfast place, but I'm a sucker for cool fruit displays. I'd say its a nice treat once in awhile for those who can consume gluten. For the gfree crowd, probably best  to go elsewhere for now!"}
{"text":"I find Cora's can kind of be hit and miss - especially since my options are basically limited to omelets. I was meeting my friend for brunch and since she was running late I ordered a latte while I waited. It was pretty terrible, made worse by the $4 price tag. Might as well have stopped at Starbucks and had a good latte!  Our server wasn't too well versed in what did/did not contain gluten and said that the buckwheat crepes were safe. I asked for the ingredient list just to be sure and enriched flour was on the list. Glad I checked!!  After several tries at branching out, I gave up and ordered the eggs Benedict (sans English muffin and hollandaise sauce - gluten) with asparagus and cheese. It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My friend somewhat enjoyed her spinach and cheddar crepe. Again, nothing special.  In the end I was pretty disappointed with what I got for $20."}
{"text":"Does anyone dislike Cora's? Is that even possible? Though it is a chain, I find all Cora's that I have been to be very consistent. My favourite thing to get is Buckwheat Blessing, but I always order the cheese that comes with it to be put on the side - the portions are super generous! I especially enjoy the presentation of the fruits and I find having it quite enjoyable. Not all dishes have such a fruit accompaniment, so choose wisely!  I would have given Cora's 5 stars, but I do find that the chain could benefit from using better coffee. I find the house coffee to be on the disappointing side.  Overall, Cora's is a place I would visit and visit again"}
{"text":"While in the GTA visiting family, the parents and I had breakfast at Cora's one morning.  The resto had a nice setup; cozy, homey feeling, with the addition of the vibrant images painted on their walls.  I absolutely love going out for breakfast however, I had the most difficult time figuring out what to order off their menu!  I think their fruit cutting techniques distracted me from my desired pancakes, bacon and eggs.  I thought it was unique but in the morning, I like fruit that I can eat and not fruit I don't want to touch to avoid ruining it's beauty.  I ended up ordering the Cora's Special, which came with a crepe, four slices of bacon, sausage, ham, two eggs, potatoes and fruit.  I'll say that it was a hearty breakfast loaded with meat!  I'm more of a bacon guy than sausage but I have to say, that was one piece of great sausage!  I wasn't too keen on about the crepe as it was heavy and tasteless.  Their coffee was decent; definitely not gourmet but not instant either.  Our server was friendly but not that attentive.  We had to flag her down several times to get coffee refills and to get the check.  Overall, albeit a pricey breakfast for three, it was a different experience.  I feel that they need to focus more on the quality of the food than distracting you with their glorified sliced fruit.  With that said, we never made it back for a second round of breakfast during our visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE BREAKFAST PLACES -- the vibe at cora's is so happy, so it's a fun place to go for breakfast food.  although every time i stare at CORA's menu, i get confused and frustrated -- i never know what to order...because what i want is never on the menu -- it makes me feel like something as simple as going out for breakfast/brunch (they close at 3pm) should be simple but i always have to alter their combos or ask for a whole bunch of stuff on the side for extra money if i really want to be a happy customer - like fruit, and if my eggs come with the usual sausage or bacon or pancake - or neither.  why can't i have all three?! like other breakfast joints where the combos are usually the best part of the deal...  anyway, most of the time the servers there are fabulous anyway -- so they are great enough to offer me suggestions of how to combine what i want for a \"regular breakfast\" -- good eggs, a protein meat of some sort, toast, fruit, something sweet, and juice / coffee  so if you're a fancy breakfast type of person, you may love their strange quirky menu - they do a lot of specialty crepes  could get up to twenty a person for a meal which is pricy to me for breakfast foods"}
{"text":"Amazing!!   Now this is how you do breakfast.   Great, friendly service. Fantastic choice of dishes. Clean environment, open kitchen so you can see what's going on. Prices are a little higher than similar local places, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I went with the \"Peggy's Poached\", essentially a low fat option with poached egg on wheat toast (unbuttered) and a selection of fresh fruit, with side of cottage cheese. It also comes with two additional slices of buttered toast, should you need them.   Food was served in under 10 minutes and was absolutely delicious. Eggs hot with runny yolks, fruit chilled, ripe, sweet and delicious, but not too cold.   The meal was around $11.95 CAD, a bit expensive for what it is, but the quality was outstanding.   Really great job Cora, I look forward to coming back some time!"}
{"text":"I first went to Cora's a few years ago in Toronto and loved it, but it can be hit or miss.  The two times i have been there in t dot, it was great, but when i went to Cambridge, it wasn't great.  Now i experienced the same when i recently went to the Cora's in Newmarket.  We went on Sunday around 10 and surprisingly only waited about 15 min to be seated.  Unfortunately we waited about 25 min for our food to arrive.  I dont mind waiting if the food is worth it, but the food was cold.  Our waitress was really accommodating, and she brought us out fresh, and hot potatoes.  The sausages were pale and flavourless.   Also when we were waiting i was looking in the kitchen and i saw pre-made Belgian waffles, and i didnt know why they were sitting on a rack beside the iron. Until about 10 min later an order came through for one, and the cook took the cold waffle and placed it in the hot iron to warm it up, i was horrified.  Cora's really needs to work on being a consistent restaurant,  considering how popular they are, they should really have better food."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast combined with excellent service! They even have gluten free crepes and toast. All the plates seem to come with fresh fruits as well. Never would have expected this from a restaurant in the mall. This is exactly what we needed to cap off our ski vacation!"}
{"text":"Cant complain Coras seems to be consistent with there breakfast everytime i go Eggs cooked to perfection The day i went was a bit busy but the waiter was great and food great as always"}
{"text":"I first noticed this Cora's when I came to this plaza to visit Lezzet Shawarma after work. I had parked just in front of Cora's.   Our department went out for lunch a few Fridays ago to celebrate a fellow colleague's birthday. She chose Cora's. I told her that I loved her suggestion.   It was my first time at this particular location. It's a large, spacious restaurant. We were a group of eight. We were immediately greeted and seated.   I didn't want a huge lunch that would make me comatose for the remainder of my workday. I knew that I wanted crepes. I went with the following:  - Lemon iced tea - Morning hot dogs in crepes, with cheddar and bacon, with potatoes - Raspberry crepe with English cream  The lemon iced tea is Cora's own brand. It's in a small bottle. I was fine with the size. However, if you are thirsty, you don't get more bang for your buck with this drink!  I love hot dogs. Whomever decided to take a hot dog, add cheddar and bacon, and wrap a crepe around it is brilliant! You get two of these spruced up hot dogs. They were so tasty and filling. I loved the potatoes that accompanied the morning hot dogs.   I had ordered a side of baked beans. They never came. I was glad, as I was so stuffed that I don't know how I would have managed to eat them. Luckily, I was not charged for the baked beans.   My colleague with the birthday decided to order a raspberry crepe with English cream. She couldn't finish it all. I decided to cut a piece. It was yummy! It's the perfect dessert crepe.   I wanted to colour. I got a small pack of crayons and a colouring sheet to go. I am like a kid sometimes, which is not a bad thing.   (238)"}
{"text":"When I moved back to Markham, this Cora's location made me smile. it is roughly a fifteen-minute drive from my home and is the closest one.  As with most Cora's, it gets busy fairly early, especially on weekends. You need patience. If you are an early riser or late luncher, perfect! Otherwise, you are good if you want lunch and come here just before noon.   The food here is yummy. You can't go wrong with French toast or crepes. They are what I typically order. The various juice selections are nice, too.  The parking situation is interesting. If you attempt to park closer to Cora's, you are also competing with McDonald's. It does get busy. I would recommend parking a bit further -- either where the old Milestone's restaurant used to be or where the Scotiabank is.  I would give this Cora's 3.5 stars.   (247)"}
{"text":"8 months ago, I would agree with the posters. Back then Staff was rude, service non existent. (0 stars)  Present 3.5 stars rounded down and then on reconsideration went back up. Due to service.  They must have had a good turnaround the new staff were much better.  I stopped in for the rosemary, bright and early 6am. Only customer, they had just opened. I was greeted shown to a table, offered one or wherever else I'd like. I just sat where she wanted me to sit.  Food arrived hot and fast(I'm the only 1 there, so ymmv)  My server got me a coffee immediately, asked numerous times about my dining experience brought refills...  The food was up to Coras standards plentiful, fresh decent priced.   Food doesn't leave you stuffed but you are filled and satisfied.  I'll try again and you should to."}
{"text":"Came here for brekkie on a Thurs.  We waited like 30 mins or more before we received what we ordered which was annoying.  However when we got it, we all enjoyed our dishes. They kept refilling our coffee which was nice.  I recommend the strawberry waffle."}
{"text":"My experience has always been pleasant because the people I've been with have been excellent. The service is poor but the food is above average. Compared to Wimpy's (where I won't ever come back), this is way more decent. I like that their brunch always have fruits - healthy.   I brought my 5-year old nephew here and he told me, \"the next time you take me for breakfast again, can we come back here.\" What an endorsement Cora's!   The servers seem to look miserable though. And the place lacks window or lighting. it seems dark so the atmosphere inside is lazy and sleepy. It begs you to go back to bed. Not good for a breakfast place.   I will recommend this but ask to be seated by the window. And don't look at the waiters, you will notice that they don't like their work."}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving & it was busy but not surprisingly over crowded. Ordered the Cora's Special & received good quick service. Lovely waitress & she complimented my British accent ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times & never disappointed - despite always being busy, the service is always great. No matter what I order, it is always made to perfection. This is my go-to location because of the excellent service."}
{"text":"Food is satisfactory. Easily accessible place for a brunch. Definitely fills you up happily for a decent price.  I like the Jo construction. Bacon, sausage, 3 eggs, hash, fruits and 2 slices of rye.   Biggest problem is the wait!! The restaurant is clearly too big for the kitchen. We waited 20 mins in line and another 20-25 after we ordered. Some people were a lot worse. Don't come here hungry! You'll get frustrated but if you have time and close by, not a bad spot."}
{"text":"I rarely go out for breakfast but my friend wanted to meet up for a brunch and she wanted to try either Panera or Cora's.  With a flip of a coin, we headed to Cora's.  I wish the coin flipped the other way.  The words 'slow, idle, tardy, stagnant, sleepy, or slack' does not capture the horrible service we received here.  I think we were only one of 3 tables and each table only had 3 people at most. I think the other tables were as frustrated as we were to get our order, get our food, and get our cheque.  What I would hope to be a nice breakfast turned into a 1.5 hour ordeal.  Not fun at all.  I can honestly say the food quality is alright but the service put off any potential good flavours coming out of the kitchen.  Just as a quick note, I ordered a strawberry filled crepe.  It was jammy sweet but the crepe was decent.  It wasn't huge and the actual real strawberries (that wasn't part of the jammy insides) were really white, bland, and tasted like air.  The cost was pretty pricey for it... $10+ tax.  I think I felt a bit ripped off considering it wasn't much to it.    Save your time and sanity... head somewhere else!"}
{"text":"When you grow up, you soon realize what's worth your money and what isn't. I've been to the location on Carlton and this one. I'd have to say I like the staff here better. My waitress was very friendly and attentive.   I ordered just the french toast which, like most dishes, came with a PILE of fruit. Now don't get me wrong, I love fruit, but when you're paying $13 dollars. I don't think it's worth it unless its spectacular and ripe as hell. Some pieces of my fruit such as my honeydew and tangerines were either sour/dry/old. Also, my french toast wasn't anything to rave about. On top of that, the maple syrup here tasted bland. I don't know how that works out, but this just didn't cut it for me.   BUT good news: Free wifi here and very little people in the morning!"}
{"text":"Love this place! In Calgary for a short vacation w the kids and we ate here every morning. No wait on a Sunday morning, super friendly staff and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. The omelettes are definitely the best item on the menu! Make sure to check their app for daily deals when you go to eat."}
{"text":"perhaps my expectations for brunch have changed since the last time i was here, but i found the food just okay and the service just passable. the server was rather inattentive (considering it wasn't that busy) and seemed to want to rush out the group i was with. when the food arrived, it was lukewarm and the fruit seemed warm as well, so it didn't look as appetizing as it usually does. i don't know if it was just an off day, but i wasn't a fan and i'm not sure if i'll be visiting this location again anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went for brunch around 2pm on a Friday.  The food and service were fantastic as always but the fruit flies were out of control!"}
{"text":"I am a big Cora's fan !!!  For breakfast/brunch my husband & I find it the best place to go to. Presentation of the food is great and really tempting.  Their spinach-cheddar crepes are by far the best thing . As I write this I am drooling for those crepes now . This is one of the restaurants which I miss here in the US. Ahhh why don't they have Cora's here .  Canadians you are blessed with Cora's .. lucky you !!!"}
{"text":"Great service by waitresses,as for the construction breakfast I had the fruit look like they've  been out for the last 48 hours. Won't bee back"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday and the place was busy, but not packed. I got pancakes and fruit, which includes 3 big pancakes and tons of fruit to enjoy with. Service is fast and friendly. The crepe with Nutella is also great. The lunch is not that good unfortunately. Opens early at 6 Am on weekdays and they serve brunch till 3 PM. You pay when you exit at the door."}
{"text":"One day when my wife and I were eating here when the place had just opened, there was a raffle for a free breakfast per month for a year for one person. Well, it just so happened that my wife's raffle ticket won. So naturally, we were eating breakfast/brunch here once a month.  This is a great breakfast/brunch place. There are quite a few options available in the waffles and eggs. They pack a bunch of fruit in every plate to make it healthier. Their smoothies and juices are made fresh to order and don't have any added sugar or preservatives.   This location has great staff that are friendly and a great manager who knows what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"My family decided to go out for breakfast and Cora's was the first spot that came to mind. We were seated quickly. They were great to accommodate my aunt who has a mobility issue and rearranged some tables for us so that she had ease of dining. We were seated by the front window and it was a sunny day so that added to the ambiance of the space. The brightly coloured dining room was inviting and thankfully all the tables were level. There is nothing worse than dining on a table that tips.  The waitress was quick to take drink orders (OJ, water, and coffee) and deliver them. She was also quick to take the breakfast orders (2 eggs benedict brie and mushrooms, one Cora's special, and Rosemary's Sunday). These orders took about 40 minutes to come to the table. We went for brunch around 11:30 and while the restaurant was full, there weren't people waiting so it wasn't that busy.  Once the food arrived it was quite tasty. My other Aunt that was there received her Eggs Benedict with Brie and Mushrooms and the cheese was not melted and she felt that her eggs were under done, therefore the meal was not what she was expecting. We had to wait a few minutes for the waitress to return where she took away the meal and went to get a replacement. The manager arrived soon after the plate was taken, and we had clarification that the cheese is not always supposed to be melted, that there is no specific way to make eggs benedict. She apologised for the eggs being underdone.  The new meal was brought quickly, and the manager returned to make sure it was to my Aunt's satisfaction. We finished up and the manager brought the bill to us informing us my Aunt's whole meal had been compensated 50% and she received a voucher for her next visit.  All in all, the experience was good and we would likely return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, although there are other locations closer to me, but this one always been my favourite. Service is always great and very fast, food always taste delicious and fresh fruit and comes in very fast"}
{"text":"Efficient service and friendly servers. Food is always great. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"This Cora's is by far the best I've visited. The place is room enough to not be packed on a Saturday morning.  The fruits were cut fresh, bacon was done perfectly, Egg benedict was runny was requested, and the potatoes are not overly cooked like 90% of most breakfast place!"}
{"text":"What happened?  We love Chez Cora in Ottawa and Montreal, and although the menu is the same, this Cora's is simply not as good. The Theo's Omelette was much less tasty and the hash brown potatoes were too thickly cut and not cooked enough.  This was definitely not the standard Cora.  The seating service was also bad.  We arrived in a party of 10, but were willing to split up to get seating sooner.  The hostess refused to allow 6 of us (including 2 children under 5) to sit in a booth, so we had to wait for a table for 10.  The service was otherwise okay...  Save your money to visit Chez Cora in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Food was good..eggs were done to perfection.   The coffee was hot and the washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Food is average, service pretty good.   Now that I've been to Sunny Morning, I'll likely never have breakfast anywhere else, save Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Had the Spinach Crepe w/ their new Kale Smoothie. Very good. This location gets busy on weekends so expect a little bit of a wait. Cora's menu incorporates more fruit/fresh ingredients than most breakfast spots. This place always comes correct."}
{"text":"Very uninspired service, to the point where I had to wonder if we had been forgotten about. Food was \"ok\" unripened kiwi, dry oranges adorned my plate. The eggs Benny were half done to my request. Overall, fail, this used to be a good breakfast/lunch place, clearly it's dropped off. 2stars as my oldest daughter loved her crepe.  I don't see us returning, for what they are charging and 30% of the fruit is not fit for consumption, I'm wasting my money."}
{"text":"Still can't get enough of this hot spot!  Amazing staff! Wicked fast service! Awesome coffee and delicious fresh food! Sunday mornings go before 10am or you will be waiting in a line out the door!  Love this location!"}
{"text":"Very good place to have a brunch/breakfast/lunch. Some of the plates mix potatoes/bacon/etc with sweet food, like crepes, and thats a funny combination but still good. Lots of options to choose. The price is fair. The food is tasty. The place is cozy. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"It's Cora's,  what else needs to be said,  great food,  wonderful staff and very baby friendly."}
{"text":"Tasty as always with heaps of fresh fruit! Was very busy on the weekend, but were still seated quite quickly considering. Service was excellent and they even continued to offer us coffee after paying. Many places arent great at the coffee refills especially after you pay, assuming that you're going to run out. Its nice to enjoy that last cup before hitting the road without feeling rushed!"}
{"text":"I come to this Cora's when I don't feel like being risky and trying out a new place. Cora's is consistent even though it is slightly pricier than most breakfast places. The only things I get here are: the eggs benny, the crepomelettes, and the skillets. Came here this morning to get their \"eggs ben et dictine\" with ham (you have the option to get 1, 2 or 3 eggs benny) and a mocchacino. The food was, as expected, but the mocchacino was just too sweet with no taste of coffee. It was basically a hot chocolate. My sister got the breakfast on waffles and requested a normal vs. cheddar waffle. The waffles were mushy and the sausages were mushy; hence why I stick with my usuals.   The food came fast...our server got us everything we needed... it was a pleasant experience overall. The owner/manager looks quite intimidating and seems like he runs a tight ship. This location is also good for large groups. If you reserve, there's a nice \"separate\" room with windows that they set you up in."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 stars is just about right. Food is ok. A bit of wait. A bit overpriced. I wouldn't mind coming back if everything else is too busy:p"}
{"text":"I loooooooove this place.  Only been to Cora's twice but loved it.  I had the 1990s Harvest during my first visit and was so impressed with the amount and quality of fruits on that dish.  Then on my second visit I had the Blessing Banquet which again impressed me.  The only problem is that I love the 1990s Harvest so much that I might just order it again every time I'm there."}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm so happy there's a Cora's Breakfast & Lunch opened in the NW in the Northland Village Mall.  The food is amazing!  If you are looking for healthy, fresh food and fruit, this is the place to go.  My party ordered the following:  - Buckwheat Blessing -  3 sausages rolled in buckwheat crepes with shredded cheese and the rest of the plate was covered with fresh cut fruit.  The plate was a feast for the eyes as the fruit nicely decorated the plate.  - Spinach and Cheddar Crepe - the whole plate was covered with this crepe and a wedge of cheese in the middle of the crepe.  Fruit was the garnish.  - Western Omellette - came with fruit, roasted potato and toast, garnished with fruit  - Crepe with fruits - you can douse it with maple syrup that is provided on the table  - Coffee - love it!!    A big thumbs-up for me as I'm always looking for healthy food in restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the folks in Calgary just do not have as good as restaurants as we do here in the States, but both restaurants that were recommended to me during my quick visit were just alright.  I had brunch with a few colleagues Sunday morning after they raved and raved about the food and atmosphere. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The food was fine, not great. The service was fine, not great. Overall, it was fine...not great.  I ordered the Crepomelette which is slathered with hollandaise sauce. The sauce was lukewarm and the omelette tasted like it had been sitting for a while. The food really reminded me of an IHOP or Denny's - not some place that received raving reviews from my colleagues."}
{"text":"always love breakfast food, especially when it comes in crepe & waffle form.  the place is bustling for a weekday morning at 11am; waitress was busy but friendly, service was good. the kids menu was sooo much simpler than the regular one, which may not be a bad thing, after all.  chose the \"bobby button\" w/bacon, tomato, and cheese omlette inside, there were four--FOUR--large slices of crepe, with a little cup of fresh fruit on the side. they didn't look much at first, thin as the crepes were, but i was so full after two slices i could barely finish the rest (and i already gave one huge slice to my bf). now i know what they meant when they said \"for hearty eaters...\", duh.  guess my dessert crepe (i intended to get the banana+choco one!) will have to wait now.  bf had the ham & egg crepe wrap; for some reason the taste of it reminded me of mcdonald's egg mcmuffin, and my bf concurred. i guess i'm more used to crepes for desserts (sweet) than for meals (savory) to begin with. kiddo cousin loved her waffle topped with fresh fruit (and some milky sauce); her meal even came with a choice of juice, at some $5 only!  ours, on the other hand, were more on the $8-10+/plate side, not including drinks.   brunch or breakfast, this is the place for a good start of the day.  looking to try their dessert crepe & waffles next time!  ms. cora, come to america soon (she said she would), i'm so sick of IHOP!!! xD  btw, they have locations all over toronto, maybe other cities in canada too."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday weekend around 10am and it was indeed packed. The reason? I'm not very sure to be honest. The first time a few years ago my boyfriend and I went here and we were unimpressed and didn't have a good review of this place. This time this visit reminded me of why I don't come here.   We all ordered different things, but we were all \"ehhh\" about it. The pictures on the menu definitely made it look 10000% better and frankly it was almost like... A lie. I've said it before, but if you're going out to eat and you have the thought of \"I could make this at home so dang easily,\" then it's not going to be a good time. Most of the food was sad looking and it was average breakfast food. I wouldn't give it such a low review but it was overpriced and pretty ridiculous when places offer breakfast specials at $4.99 and you're paying over $11 for basically the same thing here.   Service was ok. It was a bit slow but it was just ok.   I think it is the convenience of Cora's being the \"franchise\" breakfast place in the area which makes it packed at certain times. I would not come back again if I had other options but if I had to, it's an ok choice."}
{"text":"Wanted to start my day off here with the family for a delicious breakfast. That's what we got...a delicious breakfast yes, with a side of knife blade tip. That's right. There was a broken tip of an obvious cooking kitchen knife tip, embedded in my meal. Highly disappointed as this could have killed me had I not noticed this blade in my meal. Unbelievable. Please be more careful...maybe don't cheap out on kitchen equipment... All I need is a cut up intestine... Not cool. I'll post the pic here"}
{"text":"Not like your Montreal locations, servers are clueless, slow, and forget about customers when its not even that busy. Very corporate feel to the joint, not your homely diner and even Dennys feels more inviting. Food is served cold, so don't expect to be wowed after waiting 40 mins for your eggs. Besides Dennys nothing else in the area that serves breakfast/brunch here so not like you have options. My advice, stay home and make brunch yourself, this place is terrible."}
{"text":"We got there at 9, there isn't a wait, we got seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu for gluten free, the order was quick, the price is fair for a breakfast place. I had the 2 eggs and sausage with sou dough, and my partner had the same thing with ham and gluten free bread. I been here many times and it's always a good experience and food is always delicious"}
{"text":"Mar. 30th, 2018 - 1:00pm  On this particular day, around this particular time, the food I ordered at this particular establishment was, in a word, no more and no less, bad.  Kind regards, Sidney"}
{"text":"Quite a bit of a wait, though lucky in getting a parking spot.  After agonizing over the menu again.  I just caved in to my cravings: Strawberry Waffle.  So Just had a Strawberry waffle. Yummy. However pricey. It was too  bad they do not have a lunch specials on the weekend.  They had $3 strawberry waffles which are smaller in portion, but at least I could ala carte it with something else.  I want to try the Theo Au Gratin one time.  Nice part I discovered today: Free WiFi"}
{"text":"Yup, still sucks.    I decided to give ol' Cora's another shot because I felt that I was too harsh the first time around and maybe it was just the bad waiter but, hell to the no...it still was a pitiful excuse for breakfast.    There was a princess infront of us who demanded a booth when there were obviously none available holding up the line, and the host wouldn't seat others in line because of the princess...then they convinced her that they could set her up in a window seat.  As her royal ass sat down, guess what? A booth was available!  I gladly took it.  Our waitress was really nice, I just really hated the atrociously long wait to get some bloody breaky!  It was insane, my kids ordered from the kids menu which was nothing stellar and I had some eggs, sausage and hash browns.  It took over 45 minutes to get our food and they screwed up both kids meals.  My son hates the Cora Cream and they slathered it all over the dish when we asked them to omit and, the grilled cheese, well let me say for $6.00 I would expect REAL cheese not that processed garbage that is practically orange plastic.    Hey, Cora for a company that prides itself on healthy eating you really dropped the ball...really processed cheese? Would this cheese be used on the hash browns and omelettes as well?  Gross.  I do not use that crap in my household and you think that a restaurant whose bread and butter is nutritious eating would use the real thing, well I should have known better considering the frozen raspberry fiasco below.  I don't know what is up with this place and why it is so popular.  Maybe my palette is just too sophisticated to consider this bland, cold, and over-hyped food worth the calories, time or money.    Bye bye Cora, I will never see you again."}
{"text":"Very over priced. Service is slow like molasses. There are SEVERAL other places in Markham to enjoy a proper balanced breakfast, at a much cheaper price at that!   Avoid like a plague."}
{"text":"My sister had a gift card to Cora's so we decided to have breakfast last weekend. I'm glad we arrived just before the big rush came in. We arrived around 10:30 am and didn't have to wait very long to get a table.  My sister just ordered a typical plate of eggs, ham, and home fries. I decided to try out their smoked salmon eggs benedict. While browsing through the menu I noticed that their prices are quite pricey. My sister's simple order was about $8 before tax. I couldn't believe a small glass of orange juice was $3 and change! The eggs benedict were about $15. Our orders didn't take too long to arrive at our table.  Without the gift card we used, breakfast would've been ~$30! I've been to several other breakfast joints and Cora's is no where close to the other places. Food is average but the price is way too high."}
{"text":"We waited about 40 minutes for our entree and when the server came she dropped the tea on the table and it spilled onto my lap. When I got the bill they charged me for everything including the tea. When I asked the manager about it he asked very sarcastically \"what do you want me to do?\". Unless you want to be doused in boiling water and pay for it, don't go here."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Cora's location I've ever been to. Second time visit. First time was before close. Server was extremely cranky and parts of the meal were cold. Gave benefit of a doubt and second chance as it's the closest location to my home. This time came at 10:30am so no real excuse for the server or kitchen. Server was extremely short and rushed us through our order. Food was warm this time but took a half hour to arrive. Server never checked up on us or refilled our coffee. Upon inspection all the severs working seemed very unhappy. From now on will just take the extra 10 minutes and go to the location on Hurontario."}
