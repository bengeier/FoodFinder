{"text":"The best way to describe d'vine is divine. I went there for a happy hour with coworkers on a Thursday and was pleasantly surprised to find it was half price bottles of wine. Awesome. Now which bottle do I choose?  I like red and there was quite a selection to choose from.  I strolled over to the bar to make my selection. The bartenders allowed me to taste my potential selections before committing to a bottle. When I finally decided what bottle to choose they were out of stock. Darn!  I allowed the choice of a 90.00 dollar bottle Shiraz for the price of the one that was out of stock which was 50.00. So essentially I paid 25.00 for a 90.00 bottle of wine. Even Better! The wine was excellent and went well with the mushroom we ordered. I will also add for those that do not care for wine there is a nice beer selection. Not your crappy beers either. Good stuff.  Our group ordered several selections from the appetizers list and we were all pleased with food. The mushrooms and hummus were very tasty. The atmosphere was relaxing with a slightly older crowd but a few younger folks mixed in as well. Water refills were plentiful as well.   My only reason for 4 stars rating was that you had to go to the bar for your drinks instead of someone serving it to you. We have another event planned in about a month so it is well worth the return visit.   Another tip: They offer mega tastings on a Saturday afternoon once a quarter where you can taste 20 to 40 wines for a nominal fee. I will need to check that out and give a detailed report. That is if I can remember it well enough to provide a review. That's it for now folks."}
{"text":"Ventured out to D'Vine Wine last Thursday night and it was worth the trip.  Lots of outdoor seating, including large couches and comfy chairs that reminded me of a coffeehouse.  Being a Thursday, it was pretty crowded, but I can see why other reviewers enjoyed it on a Monday night.    The wine selection was good and the food was delicious.  I highly recommend the tomato and mozzarella flat bread, the hummus, and the fig and brie appetizer.   My only complaint was that our servers (yes servers) seemed overwhelmed with the crowd due to a private party in the back.  Overall a great night and I'll be looking an excuse to return!"}
{"text":"The food and wine were excellent but.. We just had the absolute best chocolate cupcake in my life!  It was warm, fresh, moist, and creamy. Not too sweet. I wanted to buy the pastry tube of icing. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Always have had great service and great wine. Apps are decent but nothing extraordinary. Love popping in for a glass before a movie."}
{"text":"Never, ever disappoints! Wife and I absolutely love the place. Food choices are always interesting and top notch. Great selection of wines for my wife and craft beers for me. The live entertainment is also quite good. Can't beat the atmosphere. Must give kudos to our waiter Brad. Have had him wait on us before and he enhances the experience.  In a nutshell, a great time and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Received an email from Terry at D'Vine with offer to reserve comfy couches in back of bar for playoff games.  To our surprise, we basically were the only ones there watching.  Lots of people eating and drinking but not really watching game.  Was low key viewing with no yelling, screaming, etc. and was really a nice change.  Wine as always is available in all price points and wait staff extremely knowledgeable. Offer still open for playoffs so take advantage of this cool spot with laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a late night meal with a place that had some atmosphere. We chose D'Vine as it had good reviews, had late seating and had Saturday night entertainment until 11:30. It has a nice bar and a good menu. We really liked our waiter and the entertainment was decent. Located right in Ballantyne village on the second floor and had outdoor seating as an option (but then we wouldn't have heard the live entertainment). Great for apps and dinner or just drinks...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and adds character to an otherwise chain filled Ballanytne area.  May be my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Very unique and warm atmosphere with a great price point.  Large selection of great wines and beer. Service and staff  were phenomenal. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to D'Vine wine many times since they opened in Ballantyne Village. Most recently, my husband and I wrapped up a \"date night\" with drinks and dessert at D'Vine this past Saturday.  The GREAT: They had a hostess at the door, with an eagle eye for the available seats in the establishment. Our original thought was to cozy up to the bar (my favorite place there) with a couple of seats to enjoy a glass of wine and some dessert. She informed us there might be seats in the back we'd enjoy, or we could wait for a table to open. Sitting at a table wasn't really what I was envisioning, but I was open to her showing us the space in the back. It was detached (both seats weren't facing each other, which she'd warned us about) so we elected to take up the one seat at the bar (for me, hubby is such a chivalrous fellow :) and within 2 minutes another seat opened up. I really appreciated her work and attempt to find us a good place to be in the restaurant. It's the first time we were greeted by a \"hostess\" there.  The wine is, as always, excellent. I love that they carry Trefethen, my sentimental favorite for reasons I won't bore you with here. (They are awesome, that is all you need to know.)   The desserts were disappointing. The chocolate bread pudding was not nearly chocolate-y enough (allspice shouldn't be the predominant flavor of a dish advertised as \"chocolate\" in my opinion) and the apple pie-style dessert was, in a word, measly.  In general, I like D'Vine for the wine but not so much for the food. We did a Supertasting this past fall that was supposed to feature the flavors of Thanksgiving, but the food was terrible.   My advice: Enjoy what  D'Vine brings to the table for wine, but not for food."}
{"text":"I live nearby locally, and have been here several times.  The location and the environment are fantastic.  I would rate their wine selection, overall drinks, and overall nightlife bar scene very, very good.  They would get a top rating from me on the bar if their prices were better.  However, their food is merely okay.  Their prices are high, and their food doesn't live up to the expectation set with those prices.  Some food highlights include their flatbreads.  However, anyone can do flatbreads, and the rest of their menu is just okay at best.  If you're looking for a great place to have a few drinks and meet new friends, go here.  I would recommend eating somewhere else first though."}
{"text":"So we went back here for some apps/small plates the other night and I was really unimpressed.  I am used to going to tapas places, but D'Vine gives barely any food on plates and charges pretty crazy money for it.  Our server was nice and the inside of the restaurant is set up really nicely.  The wine we got which was suggested by our server was ok, but super expensive.  The food at the prices we paid was also really underwhelming.  I was so disappointed since I love these types of places and thought this would become a regular place for us to start going to.  I think I will pass on D'Vine."}
{"text":"Don't order the bean dip.  It's not a dip at all, it's a bowl of beans.  They provide Pita bread with it, but you are not able to spread the beans on the pita.  It's really just the strangest appetizer I have ever ordered.  Otherwise, I do love this place for socializing and listening to great music with friends."}
{"text":"Great wine bar and small plate dinner spot in Ballantyne. I liked the mahi mahi I had the last time and they substituted the sides which I think shows a gracious kitchen and wait staff. Loved the wine--I had a Wilamette white that was delicious compliment to the food."}
{"text":"This is a perfect little neighborhood bar! I wouldn't consider myself a total regular yet, but the bartenders are starting to recognize me as are some of the other customers LOL. Great wine selection, although a little on the pricey side. Average price for a regular pour of cab is $10. They have some awesome cocktails on the menu which also range $10+. The menu is smallish, but actually just right in selection. However, the dishes range from outstanding to just so-so. I highly recommend the shrimp bisque (exceptional and served with grilled cheese), but not the watermelon salad (so bland). Also recommend the pork tenderloin w/braised cabbage (succulent), but not the greek style ribs (just did not taste right). Overall, most of the menu is very good, including the desserts. The live music is always great and I've heard some pretty good bands/solos come through. If you're a first timer look for D'Vine Wine on the second floor of the main complex at Ballantyne Village. Directly across from Jade."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day.  Food was delicious and Terry the owner was so nice.   This place keeps getting better."}
{"text":"So I finally went for my second visit to D'Vine.  Let me start off by saying it is the kind of place that if it had average food, you would write it off after one visit.  We walked in on a Friday night, a band was playing inside of the restaurant loudly, where if you talk to your friends, you have to yell and you can't hear their replies. Our table wasn't just off balance, it totally rocked and not in a good way.  The host and servers seemed young and doe-eyed.  Our server went home and we got another one.  They never refilled our water glasses.  When they checked on us, it was kind of like an afterthought.  But let me tell you, the food is DELICIOUS!    We all ordered small portions and shared.  We had filet, scallops, crab and lobster fritters & a chicken dish.  I even had a cheese course with tawny port for dessert, we all had a couple of glasses of wine and our bill was a little over $100 for four.  The food is so good, I would gladly go yell at my husband over the loud music to eat there again.  It will remind him of home."}
{"text":"We had frequented this spot when it was a different wine bar and while we always enjoyed it, the former venue never really got their menu off the ground floor. We were pleasantly suprised to see such an extensive menu in comparison to the old place. We had already grabbed a bite to eat elsewhere before stopping in here, so we only had beverages. They had a very nice selection of beer and wines and everyone in our party enjoyed their selection. The new place has continued the tradition of having live music on certain nights and the place certainly had a nice little crowd... not too packed to be uncomfortable but just enough people to make things interesting. We will definitely go back to give the full menu a try."}
{"text":"Nice place to talk and hang but service is poor, food is overpriced, wine is mediocre and we generally felt unwelcome. Hipsters would like it probably."}
{"text":"The wine connoisseur will not be disappointed with this place.  D'Vine is a smaller, intimate cafe on the second floor of the Ballantyne Village complex. It has a full list of wines for every palate. There were many I didn't even know the names of!  They were perfect for a quieter venue on a Friday night. Get a table on the balcony and listen to the music on the square below. Strings of lights over your head complete the atmosphere an give you the warm fuzzies!  Prices depend, of course, on the wine. Two full glasses ran me more than $20, but I was not disappointed with my choice!  The service was very friendly! They had a strange ESP which gave them the ability to always know when my water needed refilling. They did not hesitate to check on you just the right amount as well!  They also have live music on Fridays!  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment adventure to this slightly kitschy wine cafe that is conveniently located near the cinema. But the place did not disappoint and offers a really interesting, very carefully selected wine menu curated  by some people who know wine.  Not your standard Rodney Strong ( nothing wrong with a good Rodney Strong- but there are so many other options!) Had a really lovely 2013 Lava Cap Grenache,that was luscious all on its own and eminently drinkable. My partner sampled  a 2011 Runquist 1448 - a Petit Syrah blend from Ca that was also quite drinkable. The option of half glasses at really reasonable prices lets you sample a variety with your 'courses'.  Descriptions on the menu certainly matched our palates.   Ah, yes the food.  Very attentive service that allowed you to sample the small plates at your leisure- giving you adequate time to savor your wine / food pairings. The Goat cheese dip was a great starter with the luscious Lava Cap. Mussels were quite tasty if a wee bit  -very wee - over cooked and salted. Served with a comforting rustic bread to soak up the tomatoes broth. BUT if you like meat the beef chimichurri was TOP rate.  Yyyyummmm!  Red velvet creme brûlée the most innovative creme brûlée I've seen in a long time  Overall good value with excellent quality,  good service, good portions!  They have love music some nights but you can sit at a table somewhat sheltered from the band."}
{"text":"We chose this place for a small unofficial gathering of friends and coworkers just to chat and hang out. I was concerned that a wine bar may be too \"stuffy\" for our crowd, especially one with a terrible, terrible pun for a name- but found D'Vine Wine to be comfortable and upscale, but not pretentious.  Located on the second floor of the Ballentyne Village complex, D'Vine Wine overlooks, unfortunately, the rest of the shopping center and a parking lot, but don't take this as much of a criticism- I really liked the second floor location and large balconies. The balconies had several large outdoor couches that would have been nice to hang out on on a nice comfortable summer's evening, but alas, it was winter.   We ended up sitting indoors, in several soft chairs, around a leather topped coffee table- which lent our gathering a comfortable homey feel.   It was empty when we arrived shortly after 5pm on a Thursday, but as the night continued the bar filled until there was a fairly good sized crowd of 30 somethings chatting and hanging out. I never felt that it got  overly crowded and uncomfortable.   Wine was available by the glass, half-glass, and bottle. The bottles of Reisling and Syrrah I sampled this evening were excellent, and as luck would have it- half price. (Check the calendar on their website for specials and other events.)   We also ordered some appetizers: Toasted bread with apple, fig, and brie, Stuffed Portobello Mushroom, and Hummus with toasted pita points.  There were three kinds of Hummus, and they were acceptable, but not substantially distinct from one another except in color. The toast with brie was good, though very sweet, more like a dessert than an appetizer. I did not sample the Mushroom, because it was laughably small. I would expect an appetizer that consists of a single portobello mushroom to be at least 4 to 6 times the size of the one on the plate we received. This was more like the size of a single stuffed regular mushroom from any other restaurant - you know- where you do, in fact, get six of them. They did give us another order of toasted pita points without us having to ask, even though we were not sitting a table.   All in all- I enjoyed the evening, and this was a nice place to hang out, sit and chat. We will be making a trip there next month as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kale and Qiono salad it was good. Entree; honey glazed salmon.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Love any wine bar where they sell wine at Retail prices and let you stay to enjoy it (bonus - they don't charge a corking fee).  We had the hummus trio to start, which was good (they brought extra pita which was nice).  I tried tried one of the flatbread pizzas and it was just all right - my mistake.  The live music was getting set up around 9, so next time I'll go around then to enjoy my wine with some music! Nice find!"}
{"text":"I was here just last week to meet a friend so I pull in and it was bit difficult to find a parking near by. Than I had to ask where this wine place is located and surprisingly the guy down stairs who works at the store didn't know the name of it but he was able to tell me there is one wine place upstairs if I want to check it out. So come to find out, that was it.   I was very impressed with all the wine selection they had to offer. My friend was having Riesling so I figured let me just order the same so I just ordered whole bottle. We really like the taste of it.   The atmosphere was quite cozy and there was plenty of space if you want to meet up in a group. It seemed like they even have outdoor seating area since they had couple of wicker L shape sofas out side which is perfect for summer time.   I personally thing service was a ok. The guy was more interested in the ladies than giving full attention to all his customers. Also, I think this place is a bit pricy as Mike M pointed out because my one bottle of Riesling came out to be almost fifty bucks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and liked it both times.  I love that they have a live band during the evenings.  The last one was really good.  The food is decent as well--there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians and almost none for vegans, but you can find something I suppose.  It's located in the Village in Ballantyne, so that alone means its a pretty nice establishment.  Wait staff was friendly, outdoor seating was nice--overall, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Well I think if I ever go back to this place will be strictly for their wine and music. I was extremely disappointed with the food. I ordered the filet over risotto and it was a disaster, I never send food back, this time I did I thought for $24 I should get s somewhat decent plate. Even when they brought it back was not good enough, the risotto that was swimming in blood initially was now swimming in oil and I think I got half the amount I had originally, I was so hungry by then that I just ate it, my husband had already finish his meal when my plate came back. Service was ok, the atmosphere is nice. Next time I'll stop at Jade for sushi first and maybe I'll have a drink \"D'Vine\""}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place while searching my trusty yelp app for a wine bar in ballantyne. It is a great atmosphere and they seem to have great daily featured specials. The outside is almost like sitting on your back porch only great views and te sounds of live music seeping through the doors. It wasn't too crowded while we were there but it was a Tuesday night. The menu looked really good and had I not been full I would have loved to try the cheese and cured meats. The hospitality of the bartender Bradley was awesome and he was super knowledgable about their wine list. The owner was there and was so nice and welcoming and talked with us for a while. I think this place is really cool and I enjoyed it there tremendously!!   Overall a really great little wine bar and a great place to support local business owners!"}
{"text":"Just in case you need somewhere to hold a private wine tasting and experience a great level of customer service check out Grapevine is Fort Mil, Dave the owner is great and my mother and grandmother had a fantastic time"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood favorite. Great wine, outdoor seating, great service and live music 3 nights a week."}
{"text":"We made reservations as we have never dined here.  We went on a Saturday @ 615, and were going to a movie next door after. We decided on mussels, a brie and apple plate and salads. Well what a disappointment. The mussels were not only fishy but had an odor. When my husband told the waiter they were fishy she took them away and didn't mention anything of it. The 9.00 Apple & Brie plate was such a disappointment. It literally came out with 5 small slices of apple, an extremely light spread of apple butter and  about a \"pea size\" of brie. It was nothing like we ever had, which is fine. It was just so skimpy for the price. Nice idea, but if it wasnt for the name of the appetizer \"apple and brie\" we would have never known it was brie that was smeared across the tip of the apple. We also got 2 of the mixed green salads, and once again couldnt even taste the vinegarette it was tossed in. We do not like heavy dressings and prefer the lighter style of majority of the food we eat, but I must say they need to tweak things in their kitchen a bit. It's not coming together as it should. We love to try new places and love tapas and small plate diners, but I think this would be a wine/beer stop only for us."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to grab a bite to eat, a nice glass or two of wine and sit outside on the 2nd floor patio when you're in the 'burbs of Charlotte.  A local friend and I comfortably relaxed on the outdoor couches on a pleasant Monday evening catching up on life, while enjoying a crisp pinot grigio. Hummus, scallops, and a delicious flatbread loaded with figs and goat cheese capped off the night.  Sounds like this place gets pretty busy at the end of the week, but I think I'd much prefer the laid back atmosphere we experienced mid week."}
{"text":"Paid way too much for a sub par appetizer (if you could call it an appetizer. It seemed like something I would have created when I was 10). The wine list hadn't appeared to have been updated between our winter visit (March) and June. Their website is sorely in need of updating because the \"fall\" menu is still up, although it was or was close to the one they were serving in June.  The good things about this place are the live music, the wide variety of comfortable seating, and the availability to actually buy a half glass of wine."}
{"text":"I recently went to D'Vine on a Thursday night with a girlfriend.  Over the course of the evening we had: A couple of glasses of some Chardonnay, I don't know what it was, but it was good. The only thing I really know about wine is that I like most of it, so I can't really comment on the selection. We ordered: Cheese & charcuterie: SO good! It was surprisingly filling, and the breads they served with the plate were fantastic.  Seared scallops (which I can never resist), and they were also amazing. Nice sized, perfectly cooked, and a good flavor.  Our server was very professional and competent- funny and charming without being a pain in the neck and always in your space. Knowledgeable about wine, but not an insufferable snob. She was great.  We sat indoors for a while, and then moved out to the balcony, which was really nice.  So, the reason I can't give D'Vine 5 stars? The crowd that showed up around 8 or so. It changes so quickly from being a nice lounge into a complete and utter meat market. It was such an uncomfortable crowd, it just reeked of alimony payments and lip injections. Obviously in Ballantyne it's not going to be a bunch of 20-somethings, but you can be older and single without being a desperado. I'm sorry, no 50 year old suburbanite man can pull off jeans with sparkles on the pockets, and no woman needs to be borrowing her teenage daughter's clothes to go out for the night.  The food, wine, service, and actual space were fantastic. The other patrons just made me depressed about getting older."}
{"text":"I've been to D'Vine Wine Cafe a few times now. I mostly go on Thursday's when they have 1/2 off bottles of wine otherwise it gets pretty pricey. They have live music on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday so the place can get pretty packed. It has been cold so I haven't been able to enjoy the patio but it looks great. My only thing is I wish they had a most extensive menu. All in all, I'm sure I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"It is a very cool location that is nestled inside Ballantyne Village and up on the second floor.  They have couch seating outside and inside and a pretty sweet balcony.  On Friday nights, they usually have a local band/singer that plays some cover songs.    Other than that, the food is rather good but I must point out one thing.  I wouldn't come here for a full blown sit down dinner.  I would suggest treating it like a first stop for small plate appetizers and a few drinks.  Their wine selections is pretty vast and they offer $10 wine flights (3).  That is def worth it.  The draft beer selection is pretty thin.  They do have numerous bottles to choose from but I think the real draw here is the environment and apps.  Pimento cheese app is the best!  That is something that I would keep coming back for.  Give that a try for sure.  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"I took a group of 28 people to D'Vine Wine Cafe on a Tuesday evening and they did a great job taking care of us and getting the food out in a timely manner.  I don't think when they designed the place they thought people would bring in 28 people at a time (I called a couple days ahead of time).  We had a private wine tasting in the back room where it has a little lounge area and it went very well. Then after dinner we where able to sit outside in the lounge area outside. Really a nice atmosphere and the group was very happy with the food, wine and fun.  They worked great within my budget. I told them my budget limit and they made it work.  Thanks D'Vine Wine Cafe"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite hang out places with friends and family. However went there recently for my parents anniversary and was very disappointed. The wine selection is still good priced higher than I recall.  The menu had changed and in addition to removing all the flatbreads and several other favorites, the prices were also considerably higher. The apple and fig app and the butternut squash soup were tasty but $9 for a cup of soup and half a (burned) grilled cheese? - come on. We ordered two different pasta dishes and the pasta was totally clumped together.  Salads were overdressed as well and apple tart was a small hard disk of something with minced apple on it.  All in all way overpriced now for the quality of food and mediocre service. I unfortunately will need to find a new place to go."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is pretty good but some of the \"small plate\" items are not easily shared.  It is best if you have two or three people in order to really sample the menu and not break the bank.  Otherwise, you are going to end up needing to order a lot to be full and satisfied.  We were there with a party of 5 so the sharing idea was a little more difficult than normal.   This would be a great place to grab a lite bite before heading elsewhere for your main entrees.  All in all I do really like this place.  I think it is has a cool atmosphere and is in a fun location in Charlotte.  I love the idea of tapas and this place has a nice variety on their menu.   I ordered the Canelinni Cake which was on top of an arugala salad and had a carmelized apple on top and was drizzled with a red pepper sauce.  It was a little bland but once I took a bite with the apple and dipped it in the sauce it was much better.  I also ordered the seared scallops.  They had a very nice consistency.  They were buttery, smooth and melted in my mouth.  They were also very fresh but the one negative is that they were served warm and turned cold pretty quickly.  Others at the table ordered  the Apple & Fig plate which is served on toasted focaccia with brie sauce, butternut squash soup, and the Mediterranean shrimp that is baked with peppers, tomatoes, onions and cheese and served on focaccia bread.  All were said to be very good as well!    They had several other yummy options including cheese plates, pork medallions and chocolate bread pudding for dessert!  As I previously mentioned, this is a fun place with good food.  It has the atmosphere of an intimate wine cellar.  I think if used for the right purposes it is a great place to check out!  They have special events, live music on the weekends and wine pairing specials."}
{"text":"I have made a few trips to the wine stores that previously inhabited this location.  D'Vine has created a nice environment with a very nice wine selection.  It is great to stop in after a movie.  My most recent visit was enjoyable and relaxing.  The back of the restaurant includes sofas that are comfy and cozy for enjoying wine and appetizers.  The Red Blend Flight  allowed me discover a new favorite wine!  I really enjoyed this wine with the cheese tray as well as the musical entertainment.  I look forward to returning to sample the  Cabernet Flight.  Unfortunately for me, Ballantyne is not around the corner, so I will have to make a special trip South to again enjoy the comforts of D'Vine Wine Cafe."}
{"text":"Great place- much better than the last wine bar in this spot because they have a full bar. Worth checking out on any night- but Wednesday it gets a good crowd in the summer."}
