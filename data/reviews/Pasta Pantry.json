{"text":"Carlo is fantastic. I ordered 3 meals to deliver to a family member who came home from the hospital - and I live outside Toronto. Although they don't technically deliver, Carlo offered to drive the food over for a small fee. Fantastic service!"}
{"text":"BEST, fresh pasta I've ever had. Carlo is super friendly and ever so generous with his servings. Guaranteed that you will never ever by dry pasta in your life once you stop by his shop. Definitely a game changer."}
{"text":"Carlo is a great person. I like the store and all of his products. I made a delicious meal with Carlo's mushroom sauce. The sauce was great not spicy or salty just perfect."}
{"text":"Incredible fresh pasta, amazing stuffed Agnolotti, Tortellini, Lasagnas. Carlo will even cook his lasagna in your pan if you want to fool your friends :-). Great fresh, natural sauces and soups. Good prices. And Carlo has tons of personality. Small and he doesn't waste money on decor, but people come from all over TO and there's a good reason."}
{"text":"Delicious!!   I've never been a huge fan of stuffed pasta but after having a friend make us dinner, I had to find out where this awesome pasta came from!   A real gem of a place- I ran into the owner, a friendly man with plenty to chat about who knew his every other customer that came in. There were plenty of options for pasta (that was fresh kept frozen) with typical spaghetti or fettuccine at about $1.50 a serving, as well as various raviolis and agnolottis, reasonably priced, the mushroom one being a real winner for me.  When I went home and made it myself...pasta heaven :D   Definitely not going to be able to buy store bought 'fresh' pasta after this haha"}
{"text":"Love this little place. Awesome frozen ravioli and rigatoni. The fresh sliced pasta sheets make the best linguine and lasagna. And the owner who is always there is so helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Definitely better than the Pasta Pantry north of Eglinton near Sporting Life.  I am a fan of most of their pastas and sauces and definitely their chicken pot pie.   The meat lasagna could be better - it's too basic for me.  I would be willing to pay extra if it was upgraded."}
{"text":"I have been eating Pasta Pantry's goods for many years now. The soups, pasta sauces and homemade pasta are all made fresh and taste unbelievable! The Spicy Meatballs and the Muchroom soup are my all time favorites! In fact we moved to Los Angeles 3 years ago and I still pick up meatballs whenever I am in town, freeze them and stowe them away in my suitcase. They are THAT good! And Carlos is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today and bought a simple tomato sauce and fresh pasta! I can say it's the best pasta I've eaten in Toronto!!!!!!!  So so so good!!!"}
{"text":"People are right.   This place has great pasta you can take home and cook and impress with.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent, homemade pasta with great texture. They are also very well priced. The homemade sauces are excellent too."}
{"text":"Oh! if you want the best tasting pasta fresh and healthy then you HAVE to check out Pasta Pantry.  Carlo will even cut fresh linguini for you on the spot.  I have been shopping there for a few years now and his pasta, sauce and soups are amazing.  I don't buy boxed pasta anymore and his sauce is the only one I eat (that and my Italian mother-in-laws).  : ) Check it out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I've been coming here for years and continue to do so even after moving out of the area.  Pasta, sauces, soups, and oh, the shepherds pie! Carlos never misses the mark!"}
{"text":"I had walked past Pasta Pantry dozens of time and although unassuming, that's often times the best indicator of a great establishment (the door, a fire door it looks like, seems daunting and rather unwelcoming!).  With a dinner to cook the next evening (pasta with lamb ragout), I meandered in, and Carlo, the proprietor, cut me up some fresh fettuccine (he did not have a wide enough contraption for papparadelle).  Four servings of fettuccine came up to $6.50.  He also gave me what seemed like dozens of tips on cooking and storage.    Sure enough, when I cooked up the fettuccine the next day, it was SO GOOD.  Lots of egg in the pasta, and it cooked in about a minute's time.  Perfectly al dente, and there was a nice bounce to the noodle as well!  If I could do so, I would've eaten all 4 servings myself.      I will return for soup, meatballs, and other pastas!"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM!!!! I can't even decide how to start this review!  1. Carlo is AMAZING, super friendly and willing to help you out picking your pasta depending on the dish you're cooking. 2. He'll cut fresh spaghetti and fettuccine right in front of you and pack it up (can't get any better)  3. His sauces are super high quality and he makes sure everyone can eat them (even kids). My bf an I love his meat sauce and alfredo (we spice up the alfredo with some wine and fresh onions just because that's how we like it)  4. If you're a pasta fan, you NEED to come here!!!!!  5. It's super affordable: For 5bucks we got enough pasta for 2dinners and 2 lunches"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Pasta Pantry Fine Foods was Valentine's Day 2014. I wanted to cook up some yummy grub for the boyf and thought this would be a little different than our normal fare, and I could take half the credit. The stuffed pasta (butternut squash, IIRC) and vodka sauce did not disappoint!   Fast forward almost a year later and I get a real craving for those little pillows of delicious. I call the store to see what time they close: '7,' the owner (Carlo?) says, 'but I'm usually here a little late, so if you're going to get here after 7, give me a call.'  I wasn't able to make it, but really appreciated the customer service. Fortunately, the boyf was able to go for me, so the craving was satisfied, and just as delicious as I remembered.  My biggest tip would be to ask Carlo for any advice he has on cooking the pasta &/or the sauce that you've chosen: the man KNOWS what he is talking about. The sauces and pasta are great on their own, but his tips (green onions in the vodka sauce!) took it to the next level!"}
