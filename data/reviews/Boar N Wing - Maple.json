{"text":"Wings were gigantic however size is not everything. The hot and honey were not spicy at all and the dry rub was just okay. The side order of fries were terrible. Interior is decent and there are tons of screens playing all sorts of sports. Could be a good joint for a big game but likely not a place I'll be revisiting otherwise. Much better wing options around."}
{"text":"-Generic regular wing and bar
  -Yes there are televisions EVERYWHERE, but there's no point if they only play 3-4 channels at once. 
  -DO NOT buy in the \"70+ flavours\" hype, they are only mixing existing flavours and having them as different levels of spiciness.
  -Their wings are okay, no differences between all the other more popular chains for wings. 

Normally I'll add 3 stars but I notices some few things:
  -The wings are big, so you get 7 wings...but Big Bones BBQ Maple are a little bigger and you still get 7 wings (taste better and cheaper and comes with fries)
  -They didn't serve their wings with \"Carrot Sticks & Celery with our Signature Garlicky Ranch Sauce?.\" (From their website), I went there twice."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but this place was an embarrassment. The service was beyond slow but in their defense they were slammed with UFC, soccer, and Leaf fans. I can handle slow, and below par service but the food...was...awful. My wife and I ordered the California Salad with 2 orders of 5 boneless wings, 1 hot with blue cheese, and 1 medium honey garlic. BOTH were worse than a kids menu chicken fingers you would get at a Dennys or Waffle House type joint in the states. Again, I can handle subpar service but if you are charging your customers top dollar to eat food not worthy of a McDonald's menu there is something seriously wrong. $120 later my wife and I split completely unsatisfied and disgusted. Why didn't we send food back or make a stink you ask? Because we were just happy to be out for the first time since welcoming our 5 month old son so we didn't want to deal with it.

Advice to management/owner; staff appropriately when multiple big sporting events are scheduled, DO NOT serve frozen battered Tyson chicken fingers to customers paying for something at least semi fresh when buying/battering and frying fresh chicken is likely cheaper and 100000 times better. 

I visit Toronto often as my wife is from this city. There are good places all over but unfortunately this is not one of them. I can honestly say I've been to shitty hole in the wall joints in my home town of San Diego that wouldn't serve their roaches the kind of food this place is putting out. Get it together or I can't imagine you will be in biz for much longer."}
{"text":"Went here to watch UFC.  Shitty service, dry overlooked wings, bad lighting, crappy TV set up and badly run.  Couldn't even figure out how to change the channel to UFC fight.  I had to go to the bar and show them how to use their own remote."}
{"text":"This is place is great. The wings are big awesome and service, fantastic. Ask for Victoria."}
{"text":"Great wings and a lot of flavour to choose from but SOOOPER SLOOW service.
it took them 45 minutes to get our wings, and 20 minutes to get our order. We were all starving by that time.

They seem to have a buy one get one pound free thing going on this month so the wings are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Dropped into this restaurant on the Monday of the Victoria Day weekend looking for food to take home.

We ordered a scrimp dish and a rice dish. The prices are excessive for the quantity of the food received. Portions were very small. The quality was okay.

Not worth a return visit"}
{"text":"Ok not what I expected by other people. So I had a pound of wings that were nothing special. The beer selection was not that good, and one of the servers seemed almost under age. I still tipped her but she really did not do good job at serving me. It felt like forever to get a drink. I think she was more interested in talking on her cell phone then paying attention to the customers. Over all I have to give them a 2 star for food and service."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddies this past weekend.

It was packed for the game and the place was happening.

New order beers around and they have a great selection on tap.

Order the nachos, wings, french fries, onion rings and other table favourites.

The food was great for bar food. Unfortunately the service was very slow. They got a few items wrong and it took a while to get replacement orders.

The service was good otherwise and the price was very fair. Hope to be back at the next major game."}
{"text":"I actually love their wings! 

I've come here twice for drinks and wings, usually opting for the medium with buddy-o-buddy sauce (similar to gar-par from BWW.) Yummo! I can honestly say their wings are HUGE. I tried to take a picture of a wing compared to my palm but it did no justice. I get that size isn't everything but I'd rather 7 massive, perfectly cooked wings over 10-13 piddly, single bite wings. I find the smaller the wing, the more dry and overcooked they get. These are not the case what-so-ever. It's worthwhile going on a Thursday for a pint and a pound. 

I'm holding back a star because I wish they included fries or carrots/celery in their wing nights. Last night I asked for a side of celery and carrots; they were wilted and sad when they arrived. 

They have daily specials too, the best being Tuesday and Thursday IMO.

Our server on both occasions was Diana - she was thorough, polite, easy to approach and forgiving for special requests. She also bunged up our bill once but fixed it without hesitation and took responsibility for the error *brownie points!*"}
{"text":"We opted to try this one out after 9 pm Sunday evening for our first time since we've seen it when driving through the plaza many times. We have learned to keep a lid on our expectations to avoid disappointment. The decor was comfortable and offered a nice atmosphere for casual company. We were very impressed with the big juicy wings. They were freshly made, well seasoned and quite crispy which we like. The onion rings had an onion core, were well done and tasted good too. The selection of draft beers was much better than most chains which is a big deal. What really stood out for us was their customer service. They get it. While there are many alternatives for wings and the like, I'm going to make this a regular destination. They appreciated my business rather than took it for granted. You know what I mean. After serving order to table, most servers will stop by soon after and ask if food etc is ok but rarely do anything if you answer honestly. This was not the case here. They genuinely wanted us to be happy and succeeded."}
{"text":"Hidden in the back corner of the complex, this sports bar replaces the previous resident 'Wild Wing'. Overall this replaces a generic wing-centric pub with a generic wing-centric sports pub. This bar offers ample sports viewing opportunities with 34, yes you read that right, TVs wall mounted in the space of a small strip mall location. 5 of the TVs are booth mounted to allow individual selection, though with the sheer volume of HDTVs if the game isn't playing on the wall, it isn't on TV...

First, beer selection is generic Canadian mega-labels with the craft brew on tap being Sam Adams. Bottles offers up standard generic labels as well as Guinness and Strongbow cans. Pretty Ho-Hum.

The menu selection is traditional pub fare of burgers, sandwiches, pizza, and various deep fried offerings. First tried the spinach-artichoke dip which was fairly bland and seemed to be missing most of the artichoke. Trust me I searched... There were ample chips and pita slices for dipping though. Second, tried the crown of the menu, wings. They have 73 flavors on the menu though honestly it's more like 15 with various drizzle/dip variations. For example, Hot wings/Hot Wings with Blue Cheese drizzle/Hot Wings with Mustard Drizzle/Hot Wings with Blue Cheese AND Mustard Drizzle.... The wings come breaded though unbreaded is available on request. The wings are amply sauced and flavorful. Good but had better.

On a weekday night the location was quiet with several groups conducting male bonding over a Leafs pummeling. Service was quick, especially since the bartender was also host and server. Prices were middle of the road though 2 generic beers and 2 appetizers for 40$+tip seemed on the steep side. There are nightly specials with Wing nights on Tuesday. 

Honestly, not much to draw me back outside of the fact that Pub locations in the area seem to all be nearly identical to this anyways and sparsely located. Good location if your trying to save gas and stay close to home."}
{"text":"Very good place after the new owner took over about 5 months ago.
TVs everywhere with private TVs booths and one huge screen above the bar. 
They have killer bloody caesars if you're a fan of it.
Fries with garlic and parmesan are very good. 
I'm not a fan of their wings, they burn them too
much in my opinion, but their chicken sandwich is really juicy and tasty. 

Probably the best sports bar in this area hands down!"}
{"text":"Great place for sports events . I have been there more then ones or twice. Always good time . Keep it up ."}
{"text":"First time there yesterday. The service was good but the food was awful. 

Ordered 3 lb and to be frank, the wings had a funny smell & taste to it. The flavors were dull. Do not order number #38 on the list. 

Great place for sports games... But that's about it. 

Service: 5/5
Food: 0/5"}
{"text":"Real wings big size!! Better then wild wing, service was good. I was waiting for 15 min, once the wing comes, I understand why it took long time. It is big wing, need to take more time to cook. The fires are good. Many tv. There is tv on each table. Good experience."}
