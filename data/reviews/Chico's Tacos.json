{"text":"Let's start by talking about what I DID NOT have....carnitas, lengua, cabeza, Al pastor. ....they don't offer any if those! Only chicken, Carne asada or fish. This is Phoenix and you don't offer anything except those 3 for tacos or burritos? With all the taco and burrito options in this town, chicos falls on their face with very limited options. as for what I did have, the carne asada burrito was not very good. I specifically asked if there was rice in it they said yes but there wasnt any. The meat was just okay nothing stands out. don't waste your time here. There are way too many other options close by that are awesome."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I usually get the tacos, (hey it's in the name), but this last time I got taquitos. They pretty good, albeit small. I also asked for no onions or tomatoes in the gauc, and they came with it anyway, but whatever."}
{"text":"Chico's Tacos is kind of the queenly sister of the chain Mexican restaurants peppered around Phoenix like so many grains of sand in your swimsuit. It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.  This fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \"lunch rush\" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.  A quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called.   If you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.  I have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \"grilled\" platter, or the entree includes \"grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \"crunch\"? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.  The rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!  The inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles. Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood...not that I've, you know, tried that...or anything..."}
{"text":"You're joking right?  Went here for Taco Tuesday and I have to say; Worst Taco Tuesday EVER!!!  Don't be lured in by the $1.29 Tacos, go somewhere else.  The Chips were very basic, and the salsa bored me. My 3 Tacos came out and I didn't quite know what I was looking at.  Are they hard shell or soft shell? Why did they put lettuce and cheese on them?  The Shells were OK, but the meat was a poor attempt. The Shredded Beef was mushy, no flavor. Chicken texture was ok, but no flavor. Ground Beef? What is this stuff? Mushy as hell, no flavor at all....."}
{"text":"We usually go there as an office for lunch  a few time a month but today we had an in-house meeting so we ordered.  Got there and the order was ready but the number of cups they would only give  for as much as we ordered was a far cry from past exp.   Ask for chips and threw in one bag, then upon returning to the office we where short on food.  Called back and got their \"FULL\" voice mail finally got through and when I said the order  was not complete the call dropped twice.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I tried this today. Bout the same as Filibertos and I always feel really bad after eating it. Just like today. Heartburn and just uck. Not good."}
{"text":"This place has definitely changed over the years!  Just found out this location is under new ownership. All the old employees have left and the prices have been raised. The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore.  The chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore. Yuck!  Depending on who is in the back making the tacos results in if you get a taco with barely any meat or a taco filled up properly.  Please bring back your old cook!!!!  The younger woman that is predominately back there now makes them so weak!  You're basically eating tortilla and lettuce!"}
{"text":"I like the breakfast burritos. I really like that I can call in my order ahead of time and pick it up on my way to work!"}
{"text":"OK, The last time I went in there were a couple of big differences: - The store hours have shifted much earlier than before, some nights closing as early as 5 PM (although this is to accommodate opening early for breakfast now) - All the regular staff behind the counter are gone...the replacements are friendly and efficient enough, but so far it's just not the same. - Taco Tuesday is still a deal, but the prices of each taco if you buy 3 or more have spiked from $.99 to $1.29.  Having said all this, the tacos were fantastic, as were the chips/salsa. I coincidentally happened to run into one of the old staff at another business a few days ago, and she advised me that this McDowell location is under new ownership and that the owners are changing things to make it more like another location that they own in Ahwatukee. As long as the food stays tasty I will continue to come back, but I just hope that they don't move the closing time any earlier during the week!"}
{"text":"Decent. Had a breakfast burrito. Not the most flavorful but it was a good price and was filling. Will have to check it out again. Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Chico's is within easy biking distance from my house, so we end up going here when we're starving and not wanting to drive any place.   I always load up on the california veggie burrito and my roommate loves the taco salad. We usually end up sharing as there is always way too much food!   One complaint - can't we get some ACTUALLY spicy salsa?"}
{"text":"When I used to work in Phoenix this was my favorite mexican food place to eat.  They have delicious food for good prices.  I always got the grilled chicken platter.  Soooo delicious! Their salsa is addicting as well.  I want the recipe!  If you are in downtown Phoenix I would definitely recommend you trying it out.   Makes me wanna work closer so I can go there every day."}
{"text":"We stopped by for breakfast and ordered chicken enchilada plate and my brother a chicken quesadilla. Chicken was super hard(old most likely) and dark, couldn't eat it. We left after taking a couple bites. The person at the counter was nice and had a smile, but food was terrible and its typical \"Mexican food\". I usually stay away from places advertised as \" Authentic\", but we were hungry, oh well you live and you learn."}
{"text":"Usually a HUGE fan of chicos. New chef? New management? but the food coming out of this place is different now. Especially the chicken. Which seems to be roasted chicken, RATHER than the grilled and fresh chicken I've always been used to. I guess I have to find that elsewhere now. I still will go for the breakfast burritos. Good place. Just seem to be changing"}
{"text":"Definitely a place for take-out rather than dine-in, Chico's is not a chain as at least once recent reviewer has stated.  It is family-owned and non-franchise.  I highly recommend ordering the following:  ranchero-style carne asada burrito fixed enchilada-style.  It's deliciously saucy, not on the menu, and the only thing I'm interested in at Chico's.  It should make your day (or at least your lunch).  One last piece of advice:  Unless your in a pinch, don't bother with the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I personally have not eaten at Chico's Tacos, but my co-worker, who sits right next me, just did. She managed to take three bites of the taco salad before dubbing it 'weird tasting' and that was the beginning of the end. One hour later, the office got blasted with an uncontrollable rip by the eatee. The stench was so heinous, the box fan by my desk could barely hold it at bay. My other co-worker did not fare nearly as well. We'll be holding the wake on Wednesday. Rest her soul. Yeah, with what I've experienced, and just second hand, I don't think I'll be taking my business there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I agree that Chico's isn't exactly high end; however, if you are craving quick, simple Mexican flare that isn't from a scary drive-thru and won't break the bank then this place is it.    I'm surprised only one person mentioned the Achiote Chicken Salad.  I CRAVE this salad and try to get it at least once every few weeks (it's $5.99 on Thursday).  My friend who introduced me to this place moved to San Diego and when she visits, this is where we go and what we get.  It's made with crisp, fresh, bright green romaine lettuce (no iceberg!), black beans, a small scoop of their spanish rice and the tastiest grilled, shaved, spicy chicken breast (no scary bits).  It's topped with diced tomatoes and 1/2 sliced avocado.  The best part is their chile dressing.  I like to use 1/2 of that and 2 sides of their pico de gallo on top.  Scoop it all up with some chips...DELICIOUS.   On a whim, we once ordered the bean burrito.  I'm Mexican; from New Mexico (read I take my beans seriously).  This is hands-down one of the best reasons to spend $5 for a bean burrito.  Order it as is.  You won't be sorry.    My fiance has had some decent experiences with their oher menu items, chimichangas, beef tacos, etc.  Pretty standard fare.   Stick with the salad and bean burrito, you won't be sorry.    To boot, they serve Mexican Coke in a bottle."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for lunch as I've passed by it a few times, and it seems busy.  Got there, placed my order (Tres Tacos, nothing else), and waited. And waited.  And waited some more.  Finally after about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked one of the girls behind the counter what was going on, and she never gave me a clear answer - just mumbled something to the cooks and all of a sudden my food magically appeared. All I got was a mumbled \"Sorry\".  By that point I was already over my 30 minute lunch break.  If I hadn't opened my mouth, I'd probably still be waiting for my food.  After all that, they weren't even anything major to write home about - the soft taco shells tasted a little raw, and the fillings were decent, but again, nothing to brag about. I'm sure it's like every other taco shop on McDowell.  It didn't seem that they were short staffed, but with such a fast and busy lunch crowd, I expected better.  Don't think I'd go out of my way to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Salt / garlic / flavor would be nice. This is your usual run of the mill  tasteless  Mexican food  meant to please the masses . I absolutely can't stand that plastic bagged lettuce smell. It turns my stomach. But if you want quick random food, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"I enjoy Chicos Tacos when I am downtown.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I like to come here on Taco Tuesdays for their $1 tacos.  You can order either chicken, steak or beef tacos, (3 taco minimum) for a dollar, and you get a side of fresh tortilla chips and you get to choose from their salsa bar.   The chicken tacos are definitely the best, the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor.  They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me, I can never eat more than two (which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks, but who can beat $3 for lunch with leftovers?).  The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken, the steak just isn't very flavorful, I definitely would not recommend them.  I have never tried the beef, which come on a crisp taco shell.  I tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos, so I haven't really been interested in trying the beef.    I think the rest of the menu tends to be a bit expensive for what you get.  I Wouldn't really recommend coming to Chico's unless its for the dollar tacos.  The chips and salsa bar is pretty great.  Lots of different types of salsa with varying levels of kick.  This is a great place to come for  a cheap, fast, working lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, portions and value!!!  Don't let the unconventional locale fool you...Definitely a must-stop whenever in the 7th St & McDowell vicinity.  Go for any of the asada and pollo plates and nachos...You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"But it just closed permanently. They had the best tomatillo salsa in town. They had great carne asada both the platter and the quesadilla.  I hope I can find great tomatillo salsa somewhere else in town."}
{"text":"So sad! Ive been coming here for 15 years and used to love this place. My 5 star review is now 1. Prices have gone up $2 and portions sizes are going down. The food is still good but its not worth the money. I dont know if management changed or if they just started trying to gouge people but i hope something changes. They lost a long time loyal customer today."}
{"text":"The carne asade quesadilla was delicious. The meat is sort of like shaved chunks; so you taste the meat. Yet, it's still very cheesy. The $1.99 margarita was a yummy bargain, too.  I've eaten here about three times. Every time, I was pleased. The food is good and affordable. Plenty of seating. More than ample serving sizes. (I think I've seen construction workers eating here every time I've come.) Convenient location just off the 7th St. exit of the 10."}
{"text":"I thought this place was kind of a ripoff and the food was mediocre at best.  I got the arroz con pollo and a large drink for just over ten bucks which I personally thought was a lot, but I got a couple salsa cups and took a seat.  The salsas were okay I guess, one is called casera and it sure tasted like the Herdez Salsa Casera you get at the grocery store. My lunch arrived and it wasn't quite the arroz con pollo I'm used to.  The rice was completely devoid of flavor, the chicken was a very small portion of thigh meat simply grilled which tasted okay but certainly nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place offers decent food at a great price. Every Tuesday is \"Taco Tuesday\" - $2.00 tacos. The portions are good and the staff is friendly. I usually order their tacos with corn tortillas. Their salsa bar is fresh and clean. The atmosphere is funky and the restaurant was clean. The manager told me they do offer catering and they have a separate menu for that."}
{"text":"Missed this place for about seven years while I worked elsewhere. It is every bit as awesome as it was when I worked downtown many years ago. Superb variety of menu items. i go for the diet-friendly chicken tacos and the amazing salsa bar. The staff recognizes regulars like me and they're super friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. I've only been to this place twice, but the last time made the final decision to never return. I went in on a Tuesday for lunch since they have the taco specials. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 steak taco. Never once did I hear my number be called. It was busy in there so I continued to wait. After about 20 min of waiting, I decided to go to the counter. The lady then informed me that someone else took my food! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! That didn't sit too well with me especially since they check the numbers before handing out the food. So I had to wait an additional 5 min for the cook to prepare my food again. I only get half an hour for my lunch so I was furious! There was no apologies from anyone. I didn't even want the food by then. Once I actually ate the food, the tacos were hard (almost stale like) and the chicken was way too chared. I defintiely won't be returning and I will NOT recommend anyone to this place."}
{"text":"I came here after a grueling evening swim practice so I was really hungry - which means anything should taste really good, right? I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"My go-to Gringo-Mex place on the way into work.  This stems from lazy, and nothing more. The places I'd prefer are either out of the way, take too long for spur-of-the-moment food, or are located in a manner making it inconvenient to get directly to work.  That said, it's easy to get in and out of when I am headed west on McDowell. The prices are fair, the portions are large and the food is fresh. From time to time, it's even flavorful!  Would I rank this among the best Mexican food in town? Not a chance! Would I rank this place among the best Gringo-Mex places in town?  Nope. Is it clean and fast and completely serviceable to eat at my desk? You bet!"}
{"text":"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  It's a little place in a very small strip center.  It's very much a neighborhood place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  That's about all I can say about the setting.  I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos aren't  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole.  I will go back to Chico's.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!"}
{"text":"Paid 10.49 for unedible 2 taco plate which i threw  away. complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund. meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth. It was truly horrible tasting. Worst mexican food I ever had this place is going on my NEVER again list. Go taco bell its better. Also there was very loud construction jackhammering  going on in the back which ruined the visit as well."}
{"text":"What's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance, really bad tasting food, and rude staff? Nothing.   I almost never eat at these big chain half-fast food restaurants. I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it would be better than taco bell. Wrong.   The tacos I got on taco tuesday tasted terrible, and then gave me about 12 hours of food poisoning.  Go to a mom and pop taco shop and avoid this place like fire avoids water."}
{"text":"chicken \"works\" giant burrito. lots of beans but not enough chicken. hochata is decent."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Most of the food on the menu is decent, but the Arroz Con Pollo is amazing!  The salsa bar is clean and the regular salsa is perfect.  The staff is friendly and the prices are low - around $6 per plate (large portions).  Cheap beer & margarita - $1.99 most days.  This is an order-at-the-counter-and-seat-yourself kind of place, but the seating area is nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"This was one of the first Mexican food places I tried when I first moved to AZ ten years ago.  Back then I knew nothing, now I see that I was lucky to have been taken somewhere that would really get me interested in trying more Mexican restaurants.  Well after about 8 years I went back last night and had it again and I was impressed.  The beans were a little bland but that is about the only complaint I have.  The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito. I could have just eaten a couple of the tortillas with the salsa.   My boyfriend got three hard shell beef tacos and it was only $3.49 and it came with chips. So not only was it tasty, it was cheap.  It is close to the freeway so even though I don't live very close I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"One of my first or few Mexican experiences in Phoenix that are actually authentically enjoyable.   Entered there for early lunch and not very hungry which is not a good sign for lunch place reviews. Ordered a shredded beef tostada and a beer at 11.30 :). They have a nice selection of Mexican beer. Have to ask if they make Micheladas.  Tostada was buried in salad but was good! Especially because of the salsas they have in the amount that you want. Their green salsa - salsa verde was very good. The red ones I would definitely improve and chill a bit more. But it was so pleasant experience and I felt like in the right place.  Wanna try also their fish tacos next time.   And I just wanted to shop at Safeway :). Good for me:)"}
{"text":"Everything went better than expected!  We went here for lunch the other day after the original place we picked was too busy. By the looks of it I thought it would be a fast food style Mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not high. I was presently surprised.   Walking in there was lots of room but not very busy. The menu was well displayed. I went with the Achiote chicken salad which was quite good. I spiced it up a little with some salsa from their well equipped salsa bar. Although the salad was good I soon regretted my decision as I sampled my friend's baja fish tacos. I love fish tacos. I REALLY love fish tacos. If my life was a video game their would definitely be a side mission that entailed trying fish tacos at every restaurant in the game. Anyway, the fish tacos were delicious. Everything I could've hoped for. A very classic fried fish taco.   Now I can't stop thinking about fish tacos. Review over. I'm going to lunch."}
{"text":"El Pollo plate was delicious!!! Chicken is perfectly cooked, rice n beans and 3 flour tortillas! A must try!! Salsa bar with alot of different choices ! Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Thus place is going down hill. The taco Tuesday prices went up from .99 to 1.69 and the out less chicken in the tacos. On top of that, the chicken didn't taste so good. The only thing that is still the same is the front staff taking the order but what good is that if the food isn't anymore."}
{"text":"A relatively new discovery, mmmmmmmmmmm! I thought it was like a Rubio's or something...it just never stood out to me. Neither did the Starbucks. No idea it was there for months and months even though I knew there was an Einstein's (Which I've never been to). Anyway, I went for the second time yesterday and got the Huevos Mexicanos burrito...best 1:30pm on a Saturday breakfast burrito I've had! It was about $4? They are $1.99 on weekday mornings. It was so messy and dripping with every salsa known to man that is offered at the salsa bar. It didn't taste like greasy chemicals à la any-berto's. The place is clean and cheap. The veggie burrito is really good too and everything comes with chips. The murals stretched on the walls make you feel like you're on vacation. And if I ever went on vacation,  I would miss Chico's!  Mi amor!  Try it!  Por favor!"}
{"text":"OK, when I've had a little too much fun ... wink, wink. I know the only thing that will prevent me from having a hangover is the same thing that will cure a hangover: Cheap, greasy food.  And nobody does it better that Chico's. Come on, five tacos for $5?  The food is great, the service is friendly and fast and the price is right.  Let's grab a six pack, six shots of Cuervo and then head to Chico's so we will be ready to do it again tomorrow. What do you say?"}
{"text":"I went back to try it again, Had a fish burrito for 5.59 over $6 with tax.  It was \"ok\" as was my co workers tacos, and just ok for these prices  was a let down.  Read my previous review for more details on this spot."}
{"text":"What I love about Yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the \"Nearby\" search and prior reviewers telling you, \"it's okay, try it!\"  The grilled chicken burrito I had was delicious. What makes their burritos is the tortilla!  Their tortillas are the best I've had in a long time. Add the great salsa bar (small but fresh) and you have a great local neighborhood gem.  I would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat, which I love but isn't for everyone.  The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.  Their salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.  Thanks Chico's I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.  A co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.  I got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.  I won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road."}
{"text":"The food is good but every single time we place phone orders my burrito is fucked up! Done with this place!"}
{"text":"Tacos might be delicious but service is  always slow and at times particularly rude. Today I had the pleasure of watching two women eat behind the register while I waited 20 minutes for my tacos. Will no longer recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not  Bad   I pass by Chico's Tacos daily but seldom stop in. Today, I was in a bit of a rush and decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at the large menu Chico's offered.  You place your order at the counter and your number is called when your order is ready bring. The service is good, the restaurant is clean,  and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Chico's offers a \"salsa bar\" where you can indulge yourself with various types of salsas, chopped onions, chopped tomatoes with onions, peppers, and cilantro. On this visit I choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos.  I really enjoy with the grilled steak taco.  The steak was flavorful, tender, and season well. However,  I  did not care for the chicken taco.  The chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor.  Chico's offers a clean environment, good service, and inexpensive entrée's. Depending on what you order the food can be from average to not so good."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth. This place has it all: good burritos, awesome salsa, cold beer, creepy mexican carnival music, and an I (heart) Huckabees Poster in the women's restroom."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm Chico's.  I consider Chico's to be on the high end of the Filiberto's/Eriberto's/Algoberto's type places.  It's good, fast, cheap Mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating, so that you may lounge around feeling large.   They have a pretty good sized menu, with a few vegetarian options as well.  The chips are good, which is a huge deal to me, as many of the fast food Mexican places have terrible chips.  Salsa is even better, and they have several kinds that you can help yourself to.  Add in a cooler full of beer and some Flan, and I'm una huera muy contenta."}
{"text":"Chico's is popular with me and my lunch clique from work. It's fast, cheap, pretty good, and in the same shopping center as Starbucks (perfect for a post-lunch stop when we want to kill more time before heading back to the office). The chicken soft tacos are kinda bland, but the quesadillas are pretty good. WAY better than Baja Fresh or a place like that. The salsa bar is definitely the highlight of Chico's with a good variety. I'm partial to the pico de gallo myself.  It's a good place to satisfy a Mexican craving when I'm sober.  The only thing I don't like about Chico's is that it's on the corner of McDowell and 7th Street, which makes turning left out of the parking lot almost impossible."}
{"text":"This place was pretty tasty, especially because my chorizo breakfast burrito was only $3.99.   This place isn't the most fancy, but it was clean and the food seemed to be made with good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!!!! But surprisingly there is never any people inside eating? Maybe I'm not coming during the rush but I'm not complaining at all.   There baja fish tacos are like crack to me. SO GOOD!! There chips are addicting. Just the right amount of salt to go with there even better tasting salsa bar"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened to Chico's Tacos, or Chico's Grill as it's now referred to as? I used to love this place, now I can't get this look of disdain off of my face. Lousy, lousy, lousy. Another former favorite of mine off the list. The carne asado was fatty and grisley (sp?), the chicken was the highlight of the meal, which is not saying much. Oh well."}
{"text":"So once again this would be part of the top five lunch spots that I drive to weekly as the \"lunch b***h\" for work. I do like that every time I go in, I am greeted by the same shy girl at the front who basically knows my whole order w/o second glance. I have only tried a few things here, but everything I have tried has been pretty darn good. My bosses, and I particularly, enjoy the chicken salad. Sadly they used to have a $3.99 special, but now it is back to the regular 6-7 bucks. They have a really great achiote dressing and the salads are pretty big. But I have to say I have a new favorite with the shredded beef burro. Classically simple, chunks of beef with beans and cheese. Whatever they marinate their meat is awesome, and I am generally not a meat fan. Long story short, skip the Fili B's on every corner, and venture into the strip mall. Can't beat the $1.99 margaritas either!"}
{"text":"$1 Tacos on Tuesday are great!!  Good size and plenty of meat in them..."}
{"text":"I usually come here for the chicken salad, which I really enjoy.  The idea of a good salad in a Mexican establishment is great and I would still return to have one, however, I strayed last night and had a carne asada burrito.  Sadly, the meat was really bad. No taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle. I had to throw the meat out of my burrito. Other than that, the rest of the ingredients were good, and of course their salsa station is really good.  So my advice: have something other than the carne asada here, and you should be ok. The staff is always nice and other than the carne issue, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been riding by this place when visiting Safeway and finally decided to try it for breakfast after boycotting America's.  I was not disappointed.  The ham breakfast burrito I had was very filling.  My wife had the Chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint.  Most importantly we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.  My second time here was the same.  I decided to try the Wednesday special, Arroz con Pollo and my wife had the chicken chimi.  We again were satisfied.  I hate to compare Chico's to a Filiberto's but it is similar in style but provides a better product and friendlier staff.  I am looking forward to spending happy hour here one day as it runs from 3 - 7pm and offers $2 imports and margarita specials.  If you have not checked Chico's out, just do it!  When there don't forget the salsa bar.  Thank you Chico's we will be back."}
{"text":"Chico's tacos rocks!!!   Best ever  dinner I ever had that place rocks even serves beer awesome everything about that place is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is ok. they raised the prices but the 2$ beers are still a great price. sometimes the tacos are better then other days. hit and miss. the salsa bar is Aplus..pico is good. Try the Chicken salad its like a meal!!!! real good chicken..charbroiled..yummy. the ladies working here make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"I am an avid Mexican Food Eater so this restaurant honestly caught me off guard a little bit and I have dined here twice, once by myself for lunch and then once for dinner with my boyfriend.   I originally discovered it with the intention to go to Subway (next door) but then decided to try this place instead. The restaurant is a decent size but definitely gives off that hole in the wall mexican vibe that always makes me excited to taste their food.   The staff there is decent, they were not overly helpful but not downright rude either. I was a little put off the first time I went there because their credit card machine was down and so they asked to write down my card information and charge me the following day (but in the end that's exactly what they did and I didn't have any issues with it). So I agreed and ordered the cheese enchilada meal with rice and beans. I feel like for what I received it was a little overpriced. The enchiladas were pretty good as were the beans and rice (with salsa from their salsa bar of course). I really enjoyed the salsa bar.   The second time I went for dinner with boyfriend and ordered the taquitos. Again a little overpriced for what I got but they weren't terrible. My boyfriend got the taco dinner and he enjoyed it.   Overall the food is average and a little overpriced but decent if you have limited time and need a Mexican Food fix."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but generally filling and not bad. Tonight's Arroz con pollo provided a decent, filling, tasty and inexpensive meal.  The dining area was (and is usually) clean, and the men's room is adequate, seems sanitary and has always been stocked with the necessities.  Several specials a week make the place even more extraordinarily affordable than it already is.  I've certainly experienced better - but considering every meal is a value at Chico's, it's A-OK."}
{"text":"i picked up a baja fish burrito from here the other day during the lunch rush and the line moved quickly as did my order through the line. while i was waiting i managed to snatch up a dq free blizzard coupon from their coupon wall which i have added to my jewish food stamp book.  i took my burrito to go as well as a couple of salsas and a to-go bag of chips (complimentary). got home and wolfed that bad boy down. short and fat little thing, but totally filling. the fish was good and they use cabage in their burritos which i love.   fresh, tasty, and filling. i'll be back. especially cuz they dropped a couple of coupons in my bag. incentives like that to come back are always good. and they have 1.99 margaritas. yum."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today for lunch since I was in the area. The service was friendly and nice. I ordered the carne asada tacos. First I got chips and went to the salsa bar. The chips were noticeably stale, but the salsa was good. The carne asada tacos were gross. The meat tasted spoiled, the texture was weird and it was greasy. I was very hungry but could only stomach two bites. The beans were runny and tasted bad. I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"Chico's Tacos is hidden away in a strip mall right off the corner of 7th Street and McDowell. You can get a burrito, get your taxes done, cash a check, grab a bagel and an espresso before grocery shopping. Neat!   Chico's food has always been hit or miss with me. The fresh salsa bar is the stand-out feature, with salsas in varying degrees of intensity (I tend to go for the pico de gallo as, I am sure my friends will attest to, I am a wuss). Menu items include the standard tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas and nachos. There is also your choice of soda, beer, iced tea and margaritas.  I think I had just missed the lunch rush as it was still fairly busy when I went in. The food was prepared quickly, which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch. The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty, but a bit on the bland side. The only thing wrapped up in the tortilla (which was swimming in grease inside my to-go container) was cheese and grilled chicken. The side of sour cream helped and the addition of pico de gallo made it much better.  Chico's works well as a lunch spot during the work week because of its central location. However, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired as it's right next to one of the busier intersections in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chico's is delicious and in a convenient location! It's by no means gourmet. But hey, if you're in the area and looking for some decent food at a reasonable price, Chico's is the place.  I come here every Tuesday during my class breaks at ASU's downtown campus. I recommend the chicken taco salad :) The shell is crispy and light, filled with creamy refried beans, grilled chicken (sometimes a little too blackened for my taste), lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They also have a wide variety of fresh salsas at their salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Tried this with a group of friends and I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the breakfast burritos, steak/eggs/potatoes, and they very good.  This joint may not look like much but the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Today, my son and I had the 5 taco deal for $7 and their chorizo and egg breakfast burrito for dinner. The food and service was very good. I used my $10 for $7 coupon from Yelp and when I asked for extra chips, they were nice to give us more. I am liking Chico's Tacos more every time we visit."}
{"text":"First time here and Not a fan. This place has been here forever. There must be something good here if they are still open. Well to be honest I will not be back. . Hope you continue stay open for many more years. :)"}
{"text":"Obviously this isn't the most authentic Mexican place you could go to eat at, but it definitely is good. I had the Achiote Grilled Chicken Salad which was super yummy. The salsas are okay--the red one is my favorite. My friend had the tostadas and she said they were good. I would come here again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by during a brief trip to the area. The food here was very heavy of lard, or whatever they use to cook everything in. Made me slightly ill from sitting in my tummy undigested. Blah.   I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining."}
{"text":"Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here!"}
{"text":"Love their Breakfast Bacon egg cheese Burritos, they are thicker then a snicker. The ladies up front are always cheery and ask how you are doing.   Fresh salsa bar with all the fixings.  I've not had lunch or dinner there. I suspect it's about the same quality, GOOD!  BAD:   While their breakfast burrito is off the chain. DO NOT get their Carne Asada Burrito from the lunch / dinner menu.  Only thing edible in it is the Pico!  I've lived in Korea and have ate dog meat. The meat in their burrito reminded me of dog meat. First the meat cut was crap, hard over cooked garbage. Most of the meat was grissel and fat, huge hunks of fat.  I was so disgusted I didnt even let the hobo that went from table to table begging for money. He hit up every table in the restaurant. \"Got two dollars?\" Not only did he ask every table, he systematically asked every person personally at each table. Management didn't even blink an eye, they allowed this smelly hobo to harrass everyone in the place. But I digress, when he asked me for money, I told him to fuck off and I felt like his punishment should be to eat this shit stuffed burrito. But he knew I meant business and quickly hobbled off.  I would rather go back to Korea and eat dog meat again, then to go back to this place.   This review doesn't mean a thing because this place is in the heart of business district, and working people will grab a bite to eat without checking reviews. But I feel better knowing I will never go back there again, and hopefully will prevent people from being disappointed and harrassed by smelly bums during their lunch break. Fuck this place, they cater to hobos and serve over cooked rat meat."}
{"text":"Cheap food, yummy tacos, generous portions, excellent salsa bar and lard free beans. AND THEY HAVE BEER. Enough said."}
{"text":"MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.  This is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos.   They have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.  The portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.  The tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.  The California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.  The restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.  And if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)  PS I think they are closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"I have been here before for some chips and margarita and had OK service but when I went to check in for a breakfast burrito, I was treated so poorly by short fuse tude lady, Yolanda. She was more friendly to the lanky, pale man who she handed 2 beers to at 10'am in the morning. I will never, ever go back there becos of her and in fact if it wasn't for me being hungry, I would of said curse words to her and reminded her how customers like me pay for her livelihood. The burrito itself was good and the cook had a more friendly face than both Yolanda and the shy cashier who seemed to have no idea on what to do."}
{"text":"I love this place. Chicos Tacos make you feel like family. The food is always on point and most importantly Robin was awesome with her customer service skills"}
{"text":"Gross. I had a vegetarian burrito and to tell you the truth ive had better burritos at taco bell. I threw it away after 2 bites. Even the tortilla wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend had fish tacos and although edible we can make them better at home useing just the microwave.  It was horrible and I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Tacos and great salsa bar... Fast, inexpensive, delicious, and right downtown. A perfect lunch hangout when downtown."}
{"text":"I hate to be a negative Nel but this place sucks!   A friend of mine suggested I try this place for lunch, the ratings were just ok but gave it a shot anyway.  I ordered a carne asada taco salad, you know the kind with the crispy flour tortilla bowl? Needless to say it was a mini-me version of something that wanted to be worth the 9 bucks I paid!  The cook didn't even take time to slice the flavorless heap of meat that sat sadly on my iceberg. The person at the table next to me had a similar complaint except hers were tacos.  This place is frequented by lots of locals  I can't figure out why...... is there a Gold Membership we don't know about????"}
{"text":"The quality went down hill, slowly at first, then it accelerated...place got dirty....and now it is CLOSED!"}
{"text":"Negative review is primarily based on their pricing issues. They advertise .99 cent taco's on Tuesday but they are actually $1.29 ea. Not a huge difference and still a good deal; but it becomes a bigger issue when you find this out after placing an order for the office and, upon arriving to pick it up, the price is on average $2 more per person. Reading previous reviews seems to show I'm not the only one who has had issues with the prices listed on their website not being honored when you actually go to pay. Taco's were fair for the Tuesday price, (wouldn't ever recommend them at the $3 they normally are) dry and a bit bland, no pico but the salsa is good."}
{"text":"ok ok , i have to say the best taco's i'm sorry but i can eat this all day no joke add a coke to that please ;]"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were not very good. Beef taco was ok. Veggie burrito was ok. Salsa could be better.  Gigantic burrito was not very good.  Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"I like this place. It has some decent fast Mexican food. The chicken is delicious. I do love the greasey foods when the craving calls for it. I recommend the Asada Platter or the Achiote Chicken Salad. That is my absolute favorite. And don't skip on the Churros."}
{"text":"I've been passing the place for a long time, then tried it because the Subway line was out the door. Tries the Achiote Salad and I've been buying that salad at least four times a month.   You can't beat the prices for the amount of food on the plate and there's enough of a selection for the kids to enjoy something too."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend of mine that has been here quite often in the past. I can see why he likes it. I had two soft tacos, a carne asada and a grilled chicken. They both tasted great, had fresh garnishes, and a good amount of cheese without being overwhelming like some places are. Free salsa bar with good choices, and if you're a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale. Planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when I'm up this way again."}
{"text":"I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's, because it's so good. First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order. This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order. But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot, but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind! So beware...   Staff here has always been nice, I've never had an order go wrong, never had an issue on quality or consistency."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place on the way to PHX airport.  Looked like a local joint but got inside and realized it is probably a chain.  The salsa is accessible and acceptable.  I got my tacos to go.  No lengua or barbacoa and that clued me in that it must be a chain and sanitized to some degree.  Plus the fact that some non-hispanics were working behind the counter.  Got the airport and looked at the tacos and realized that the chicken was overcooked and the chunks too large for a taco.  Anyway, not the great Mexican food I have grown accustomed to when traveling in AZ."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service.  Chicken salad is great.. fresh, tasty and filling.  Love their salsa bar.  Nothing fancy, but much nicer thatn the always crowded and overpriced Chipoltle."}
{"text":"Great place. lots of room - lots of seating - daily specials. They have fantastic shredded beef tacos. Good stop for a good lunch. Close to downtown Phoenix. Staff are friendly but only staff is behind the counter and in the kitchen. This is a pick it up at the window kind of place."}
{"text":"You can find me here every Tuesday night. You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!  Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.  Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.  On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.  Stop by and check it out when you want some affordable, authentic tasting AND high quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place has got to be the most disgusting Mexican place I have ever ate at!!!! Their meat was overcooked and flavorless.  Salsa had no flavor at all!! Even their tortillas were bad!! So please don't listen to want anybody else has to say about this place.  It should be illegal to sell food this bad!!!"}
