{"text":"I created an account just to write a review on this restaurant. It is absolutely phenomenal. The food is to die for and it is incredibly well priced. For $11 (part of a special for two people), I had a massive plate of pork souvlaki with rice and a side of salad, as well as some delicious pita bread. What amazed me most was the friendly atmosphere and live Mediterranean music (I think they only have it on some days; we went on a Sunday). I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We went in for a quick bite, the menu is extensive but gets expensive. Its also a BYOW which we weren't aware of.   I din't want to spend too much so i got the souvlaki plate for 12.99 which consisted of pork, fries and a bland salad. But the portion was HUGE!  And the pork was juicy and tender. This is the best pork ive tasted to this date Nothing to complain about. The garlic sauce was amazing as well.  Overall 35$ with tip for the two plates. Service was a bit cold, waitress forgot to bring me mayo and i had to ask twice."}
{"text":"Not fast-food price but not fast-food quality. I love this place; it's our go-to Greek delivery place and we'll be sad to let go when we move away from CDN.  Most food delivery services have their bad moments; this place has never forgotten anything in our orders, no unreasonable delays in delivery, never cold food. I've always been happy with what we get.  Sometimes the phone service isn't the friendliest, but the delivery person is always nice.   I'd recommend to anyone who likes Greek food!  The only downside in my opinion is that they don't have Greek-style potatoes; they only have (good) french fries."}
{"text":"I had heard legendary things about Parthenon Souvlaki from their main location on Van Horne. When I heard that they had opened up a second place on Queen Mary I was thrilled! The ambience of the restaurant is what you'd expect from a small, warm family business and  overall the meal tasted delicious!   The Tzatziki had lots of garlic and  the souvlaki was out-of-this-world. Service was fine and speedy, though not terribly friendly. My friend and I both got the mixed plate (three sticks - one pork, two chicken) which came with a house salad, fries and rice. The portions were very generous for the price ($15 a plate). All of the souvlaki sticks were incredibly tender and juicy, I don't know what they marinate them in, but it's some of the best souvlaki I've ever had in Montreal.  The sides were also quite good with fresh crispy vegetables in the salad and very flavourful rice. Other members in our dining party got the Chicken pita and they also found it to be very juicy, tender and packed with flavour.  Although we wanted to try the Baklava for dessert, by the time we finished our plates we were far too full. An extra bonus, this place is BYOW / Apportez Votre Vin which helps keep the cost of the meal down. Parthenon is much more reasonably priced than what you'd pay at Arahova or Marathon's and the food is much better. Can't wait to go back and eat there again!"}
{"text":"This supposed Greek restaurant is actually a Trojan horse.  New ownership, new absurdly pricey menu, incredibly rude staff. Same sign with no indication of the change in ownership. Definitely not going back there ever again, which is sad, since I liked the old place."}
