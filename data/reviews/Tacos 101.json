{"text":"Still some of the best tacos! Chicken and fish ones tops, addictive to snack on the chips and salsas. Upping to 5, happy to support a local small biz offering great value for great food :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not much of a taco person because it usually upsets my stomach.  My cousin kept insisting that if I go to tacos 101. She loves tacos and insists that this place is one of the best taco places in Toronto.   So I did eventually go with her and I tried the fish taco.  It was excellent.  The portion size they gave me was huge so had to take the rest home with me and eat the rest for dinner.  We did actually find a seat which was supposedly rare in a small place like this.  My only thing is I do not like taking food on the go as I enjoy sitting and eating my meal while it is hot and fresh. So if you are trying to find a spot to eat when it is busy it will be difficult.  So have it in mind that it may be a food to go item."}
{"text":"This place obviously does not need my recommendation-- it has all the business it can handle. And well it should. They live up to the wry pun in their name-- basic menu is quite limited, but these are tacos that nail all the fundamentals. Absolutely delicious, and cheap considering the generous portions. No tables, just a counter with a few stools, and standing room at another counter outside. But who cares when it tastes this good?"}
{"text":"I noticed this place yesterday morning while it was closed and returned later that day to check it out.  Ordered the chicken taco and the and the tacos al pastor.  I spend a lot of time in Mexico and all I can say is that these tacos made me feel like I was back in Mexico!  Very authentic and delicious. High quality ingredients, especially the corn tortillas themselves!  All I can say is that I'm very happy there is finally a go to Mexican restaurant in my neighbourhood!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the fish tacos
2.5 stars for the cleanliness (counter, bathroom) 
Surprisingly I keep on coming back and still haven't gotten sick...."}
{"text":"Just finished my take out from Tacos 101, I had the al pastor tacos and the guacamole and chips. Everything was great, they make the sauces and chips in house and the staff was friendly and funny and just generally really nice. They don't deliver, but for the best of reasons, there is no good way to deliver tacos, and they don't want to compromise their quality. 
I'll definitely be returning, I'm full for $20 including drink."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  This place was so good I went two days in a row, then tried to replicate at home (fail) on the second day."}
{"text":"Great tacos, and amazing guac! the chicken taco can sometimes be a little dry but the fish is to die for! Tacos are larger and more filling than you'd think. Small little spot but very cute. Front big windows open up where you can sit down and chow down. Definitely a fan of tacos 101"}
{"text":"OMG I am so in love. After moving back from California three years ago and sadly missing authentic Mexican food, Tacos 101 has finally delivered! My husband and I tried the nopales tostada, chicken adobado tacos, and tacos al pastor. So delicious. Best tortilla chips I've had in a long, long time, great guacamole, and such amazing salsas. Sorry, I am running out of superlatives. I don't think I've been this happy eating at any restaurant in Toronto ever."}
{"text":"Has good vegetarian tacos (Nopal). I didn't know if I would like the cactus on it but it was surprisingly good. The place is small but is colourfully decorated and well themed. Also the chips are fantastic."}
{"text":"I was about to die to have some tacos so I went here.I ordered Fish taco and Al Pastor. 
Fish taco was just amazing so juicy and crispy. The combination of fried cod with cabbage was just perfect. However, Al Pastor was awful. I didn't even finish it. It was so dry, hard to chew, and taste nothing. The only thing that I can taste was pineapple. The meat quality was bad. 
The worst point about this restaurant is way too cold inside. I was shivering while I was eating. 
They have only 5 sits so not for groups.
I would come back here for the fish taco but not Al Pastor."}
{"text":"First off, the tacos and guac and chips I had were great. They still seem to be figuring things out though. I ordered a pork and a chicken taco, they ran out of chicken so offered to make it a fish taco at no extra charge, and then had made too many fish tacos so they threw in an extra fish taco for no charge. I got back to the office to realize that I had three fish tacos, no pork. So yeah, hopefully they get the service up to the level of the food!"}
{"text":"I haven had tacos like this since I moved from Santa Fe. The carnitas are mouthwatering and the tortillas are perfect. 
I love horchata and theirs is creamy sweet and delicious. Its everything you could want from a taco place. More locations please!!"}
{"text":"I always recommend this place to people! This is my go to place whenever I go downtown. I used to work downtown and would order from here everyday I worked. I love how the tacos are fairly priced, and it's the closest thing to authentic. Whenever I go to places in South America, I always get tacos and Taco 101 is the closest I get to feeling like I'm out of the country again. The tacos are good portion size and 2 tacos fill me up really easily. I also love how it's not soggy and juices don't come out of it unlike other joints I've been too. It's perfect size. And the flavour combination is honestly so mouth watering. Also the staff are very welcoming and nice :) I just which they had more seating and opened up another location (specifically Scarborough)"}
{"text":"Tacos here are simple and true to their roots. The best tacos found in Mexico are on the streets and this is something so beautifully created that it feels to good to be true. Tacos 101 feel like Inception on a whole new level...like the 4th level of a dream =)"}
{"text":"This place is legit.   It reminded me of tacos I've had in Mexico (way off the resort, in local back streets) and from the trucks in San Diego (National City, Chula Vista).  Been waiting for this for a long time Toronto, and finally tasting some real deal.   I do like the interpretations served by some other popular places, but sometimes you need to have the real deal.  This place does it.

P.S.  and they had Jamaica (ha-mi-ca) - that was a nice surprise!!!  Although you can find Sorrel here at some Caribbean places, it was nice to see a Mexican place serving (and knowing what Jamaica juice is)."}
{"text":"My favourite tacos in Toronto! The place is close to the yellow line so it's easy transit.

The chicken adobado really fell short for me but the fish and al pastor tacos are out of this world!! I haven't tried the carnitas or nopal tacos. They're excellent and generously portioned tacos at a great price. I was full after just one, and my boyfriend was satisfied after two tacos. 

The only reason I dropped a star is the state of the place. It feels kind of dirty and I know that a few weeks ago they had an issue after an inspection. The place is also sort of small so consider taking out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very fair price. Only downside is limited seating space... Prepare to take out.

Portions are good size for tacos. Two is a decent meal, two if you're very hungry."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite taco joint in Toronto. The Carnita taco is my favourite. For $4.00 the price is not bad and the taco is a good size but I recommend 2 to be satisfied. Which out for the hot sauce. It's really spicy. You can taste the salsa spice level at the front, they have a bowl of tortilla chips and different salsas you can freely try."}
{"text":"The best tacos!  Large, flavorful tacos and a great bang for your buck. Just thinking about them has my mouth watering."}
{"text":"Good Day:
Thank you for reading my post.  Tacos 101 did not deliver at all on their tacos.  I was looking forward to eating at the restaurant considering all of the positive posts.
The service, ambience were pleasurable for how small the business is.
The tacos were extremely small and not hot or tasty whatsoever.  I was expecting a better product and experience.  
The size of the tacos are appetizer size so make sure you order a few to satiate 
yourself. Govern yourself accordingly, Taco Bell is open and available for Mexican food."}
{"text":"(*See below for English review)
???????????????city?????????????Toronto????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

My first reaction after a bite of tacos here was....OMG this is exact the same tacos that I had in Mexico city!!!....that's how authentic they were. It's definitely take out place than eat-in as there are only counter type of table with about 10 chairs. I had 3 different type of tacos but they are all good. I'm so glad that my Mexican friend told me to try this place out and I did!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch or dinner taco. Delicious and authentic tasting tacos. The kitchen staff seem to be Mexican. Friendly service and awesome atmosphere. Has that street taco vibe. 

Delicious, generous portions with interesting toppings. My favorite are the fish and Al pastor tacos. I am usually full from just one taco; They give you two soft shells and you can easily make two tacos with all the toppings. You can have as much sauce as you like as well! The price is very affordable (under 5$ per taco). I will continue to come here again and again! :)

The decor and smallness of this place is cool and charming, however I wish it was a little bit bigger or there was more seating inside. The seating is very limited so I sometimes have to take the tacos to go and I can't relax and enjoy the vibe."}
{"text":"Quite good. Being a vegetarian, the veggie nopal was delicious and filling. Chips salsa and guacamole were very good as well"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab food when I am near Dundas Square. The tacos are cheap, delicious, authentic, and fresh. I have tried all of the options and have loved the authentic feeling of the place. I recommend this place whenever someone is in the mood for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place. I had an intense craving for tacos and this was the only restaurant on foodora. Tacos came, ordered two fish tacos..... Zero flavour. The fish batter was super oily and gross. The chips were also oily and under salted but had a nice a crunch. Guac was meh but for sure the best part of this disappointing meal.  Definitely won't be back, there are waaaay to many great taco places in the city  to eat crappy tacos."}
{"text":"I tried the pork and chicken tacos. As others have mentioned, the meat was pretty dry but there was a generous amount. Chips and salsa were good. Seven Lives has this place beat on taste but you can get 3 tacos here for the price of 2 at Seven Lives. It'll do in the pinch if you're craving tacos but don't expect anything spectacular."}
{"text":"The meat was really bland and the tortillas has a really floral taste. The only thing going for this place is the size of the tacos."}
{"text":"Not bad, a little overpriced for what you get. Excellent assortment of salsas, but still I think La Carnita beats it when it comes to tacos."}
{"text":"Love this tiny taco place. They offer five different kinds of tacos (nopal, al pastor, fried fish, carnitas and chicken adobado). I've tried them all, and if I had to pick one, the nopal is my favourite. It's cactus and refried beans and incredibly good. The tacos are filled generously, so I usually order two. They also have fresh chips and guac and homemade horchata. 

There isn't a lot of seating so you may want to try to go at off peak times or take out. 

Be warned, the hottest hot sauce is face melting."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this restaurant. The food was decent / ok for the cheap price but nothing to rave about. The tacos were average but the chips and guacamole were good.  The people working there seemed quite nice. Overall:  Decent Food, but I am not sure if I will be going out of my way to recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"I recently started working around the corner and I've been making my way through all of the local places. Today, I tried Tacos 101, and I have nothing but praise for this place. It's small, so don't expect to get a seat, it's better if you take your food to go. When you enter you place your order, and then they offer you some free chips with mild, medium, and hot dips! I ordered the fish taco and they were great! Although they were deep fried, they did not tasty greasy in any way. They also had a nice little spice to them! They've really been able to master the fish taco in a way that doesn't overwhelm you with a fishy taste, or a greasy consistency!

If you're in the area, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Al Pastor taco is delicious. The Carnitas is quite good as well. I didn't like the Chicken Adobado as much. Would definitely go back for the first two. I was full with three tacos.

The place is very small but we were able to get a couple of seats before we got our food. A lot of people get take-out. They have chips on the counter that you can have for free while you wait, and you can try their salsas."}
{"text":"One of my favourite taco places downtown Toronto. LOVE their hot sauces and salsas as well, fish taco is so good! Average 2-3 per person is a good serving. It's a small hole in the wall place, so a lot of the times there's no seating; in summer time they open the front and you can basically stand around outside with the open front of the shop and eat there."}
{"text":"I got the nopal (cactus) taco!! it's their vegetarian option and can be made vegan by just asking for no cheese
what i love about this place is the authentic vibe you get - the girls who work there are super friendly and you can tell you're getting the real thing 
cute deco and most importantly, amazing flavour
i also got a generous side of their morita (medium spice) salsa - let's just say i fell in love"}
{"text":"Good food. Good value.   Tacos were fresh and delicious.  The restaurant is small.   Better off with take out."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 carnitas and 2 fish tacos to go. I got 3 carnitas tacos and when I brought it up and shows my receipt they gave me another carnitas taco. Fish tacos cost more by the way"}
{"text":"I'm not a local... I'm from Detroit. My wife and I had these during our stay in Toronto. The price is very affordable, we ordered three different tacos to try with a side of beans and chips. The tacos were full and full of flavor! If you're in the downtown Toronto area and craving authentic (enough) tacos, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"Unsuspecting little place sandwiched between a couple of random places. We were walking and thought let's try it! It's small inside, but it wasn't too busy so there was room for us to sit. They have chips and salsa on the counter that you can try while you wait. Loved the mild and medium salsas, but hooooo the hot was too hot for me! I had the carnitas taco and it was soooo so good. Generous portion too!"}
{"text":"They have great authentic tacos for cheap (roughly $4 each). I ordered the chicken adobado, carnitas, fish and al pastor. I've become such a tacos snob since travelling to LA and having super authentic tacos from the side of the roads, trucks and restaurants. I was so excited to see that they had al pastor (not my places make this in Toronto) but it was a little disappointing because the meat was on the dry side. Everything else was great and their horchata was yummy as well. I really enjoyed their hot sauce - spicy enough but not so over powering that I can't taste the flavours of the hot sauce and the tacos.

I wanted the guac and chips but sadly, they didn't have guac that day (WHY!?)

Restaurant is definitely small, can only seat 4-6 guests so carry out might be a good option. I would definitely recommend this place and would go back."}
{"text":"We were waking by the restaurant and decided to stop off to eat.  It is a very small restaurant with very few seats. You pretty much walk in and place an order and they prepare the food quickly and it's picked up ready for take out or if there are seats (very few) you can dine in.  

I liked the fact that the counter has the salsas to try.  The medium salsa has a good. It was smokey and had good flavour.   The hot salsa was indeed very hot and good.  I liked mixing the two together on my Nopal taco.  The cactus had a texture like avocado and the flavours all came together.  The beans were delicious. 

My husband had the chicken adobado taco.  He thought the meat was good and \"it tasted like chicken\".  He said it was good."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos with great pricing. I've been here a hand full of times & always greeted with a friendly smile & receives great food in a flash. Definitely one of the best taco joints in toronto."}
{"text":"I have been there for some fast tacos today and they were awesome! Especially the pulled pork taco for 4 bugs is a great and tasty deal! Also the staff is very friendly and funny:) I will totally go there again!"}
{"text":"If you want tacos and a quick bite for lunch and you are in the Ryerson or Yonge and Dundas area, Tacos 101 is a good place to go.

The tacos cost $4 each with the exception of the fish taco which cost $4.50. Each taco is double layered so there are two soft corn shells. I ordered the Al Pastor, chicken adobado and the fish. Each taco was packed with ingredients and flavour. I found the pork in the al pastor and chicken in the chicken adobado a bit too dry even with sauce. I would recommend getting the fish taco since I thought this one tasted the best out of the three that I ordered. The beer battered fish had a good crispy crunch to it and it blended well with the cabbage and mayo.

It is a really small place and they only have 4 seats by the window so if you are going at a busy time, you might have to take it to go. 

If I'm in the area again,  I would definitely come back for the fish taco."}
{"text":"We tried the tacos al pastor, chicken and carintas. The carnitas was the best one, the other two were kinda dry and oily. There are no tables at this place, by the way. There's 4 stools by the window."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS
Fish taco at 101 is simple, clean & fresh tasting.  Nothing fancy and unpretentious.  I prefer eating here than at Seven Lives Tacos because mainly it's not a hipster hangout where people think what they are eating is authentic.  Most importantly the tacos at 101 are more believable as a staple in a Mexican household because the staff preparing the tacos speak Spanish as their native tongue.  And economically, it's about $2 cheaper for the same product than at Seven Lives.

Self-serve homemade hot sauce station is available on the counter.  Adding both mild and medium hot sauce gives it more flavour. Just wish they would expand as it gets quite crowded in the tiny space during peak hours."}
{"text":"Great classic tacos and highly, highly addictive homemade guacamole and chips. 

We only ate the entire menu so here goes the review: 

Nopal- Cactus, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and salsa verde - pretty tasty for a vegetarian option.  The texture of cactus is a little mucilaginous like okra and crunchy like green beans. 

CARNITAS - Slow cooked pork with pico de gallo and salsa verd - your classic slow cooked pork, flaky and not too dry, well seasoned.

AL PASTOR - Marinated pork, garnished with pineapple, cilantro, onion, and salsa -similar to the carnita but the topped pineapple is  a nice refreshing and sweet contrast the savory pork. 

CHICKEN ADOBADO - Marinated grilled chicken, pico de gallo and salsa verde - same take on the carnita but with chicken instead. I'd stick with the Carnita for the extra flavour kick. 

FISH - Battered cod, garnished with cabbage, mango salsa, pico de gallo and chipotle aioli.- okay this is deep fried, so anything deep fried is pretty darn good, although I would have liked the fish to be more flavorful.

My wandering hand couldn't help but sample the basket of homemade chips stationed strategically by the cash, and of course I had to sample all three of their salsas. My friend and I both ended up ordering a serving each of their guac and chips. Well played Taco 101. 

There's limited seating, maybe 6 or so stools by the windows and wall. If you're visiting in the winter, bundle up because the only heat is coming from the spicy salsa. 

Credit cards are accepted!

Bundle up and grab your amigos to eat here!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 - I had the Al pastor and fish tacos. Friends and I shared a guac and chips side.

Wins: sauces used for both were spot on (esp the one for the fish tacos!); good portion size; great paring of pineapple with the al pastor and ?cabbage with the fish tacos

Things that could use improvement: better guac to chip ratio for the side dish (ran out of guac quickly); pork for the Al pastor was a little bit dry"}
{"text":"I had the chicken adobado and carnitas with Guacamole. It was amazing. The place is tiny so cannot sit in there but great for takeouts. Gives me a feeling for authentic mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty sizable. The fish taco was really good! I also tried the chips + salsa, and the salsa was very spicy!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in the food. I ordered the Nopal taco which just didn't have very much taste and leaked out of the foil wrapping and paper bag. I tried the fish, it was overall just OK. I had heard great reviews on their salsa so I ordered their chips and salsa. The salsa was average and the chips were just plain oily. 

There was no seating - 4 people seated max. I waited for just a minute before my food was ready for takeout but I was still waiting for my friend's. I'm glad I waited though because they forgot to put my second taco in the bag and realized while waiting. 

If I was in the area looking for Mexican food I would grab a burrito from one of the other joints around here."}
{"text":"Maybe I need to give this place another shot because who doesn't love $4-5 tacos, but I can't bring myself to come back after my disappointing experience. I came here over the summer with a bunch of colleagues since it's close-ish to my workplace. All of us ordered different tacos, and it didn't seem like any of us ended up actually enjoying our orders. Personally, I ordered the cactus taco and the chicken adobo taco. The tortillas on both were so incredibly soggy that it became difficult to eat after a certain point. They do fill their tacos quite generously though, so if you like soggy tortillas maybe this place is right for you! The cactus filling was on point (although it was my first time trying cactus) - it tastes almost like pickled long green beans. The chicken adobo was just a bunch of shredded chicken without any real flavor or spice. We did get some extra salsa to add but were unable to due to the sogginess of the taco.

I don't know why this place has such high ratings, but I wouldn't come back here over other places in the city like Seven Lives."}
{"text":"I honestly do not  know how this place is getting so many positive reviews. This place  has got to be the WORST tacos I have ever eaten. I ordered 2 fish taco and 1 chicken taco. Both tacos were dried out and bland. The hot sauce that they make is the only thing going for them. Save your money and eat elsewhere-anywhere!"}
{"text":"Very very affordable tacos here, and they are definitely worth each penny! The tacos range from 4-5$ each. Each taco comes fully filled. 

However, the flavours are lacking in SOME of the tacos mostly because of the double soft shell of the taco. But they do provide salsa sauce which adds more taste so do not worry. 

I definitely would recommend for take out because the restaurant is a bit small, but if you do eat in the vibe there is pretty cool.

The workers are extremely nice! 10/10 for service! 

Worth the visit! You can not be disappointed for the price and service."}
{"text":"Free salsa and chips while you wait and even grasshopper snacks if you want to try it. Great El pastor and Nopales. Very busy. We need more Mexican places like this."}
{"text":"I'm completely re-writing my review for this place. My opinion of this place has now changed drastically for the better, so i want my review to reflect this.

Originally i gave this place 3 stars, i had come by very early in their existence, and they simply hadn't worked out all the kinks yet. Fast forward 3 months and wow, what a difference. 

They finally added a pulled pork taco and it was absolutely delicious!! the taco was jammed with pork and some fresh veggies including salsa verde and this really awesome cole slaw. It was absolutely dynamite, I honestly could have eaten 3 more, but sadly for me, their business has been so good, that they were out of carnitas and it was literally their last one.

I also had the fried fish taco, and holy wow was that ever freakin delicious as well, i was going to add extra salsa but it was so perfectly dressed that i didn't want to change a thing. It was just so perfect. The cod was super fresh and perfectly fried in a super tasty beer batter. This taco was really a masterpiece. I could honestly eat here everyday, the tacos here are just crazy good, so fresh, so delicious... I can honestly see myself here several times a week,  it's that good.

The customer service is friendly and very welcoming, the lady who made my tacos was very sweet. I had a absolutely great experience here and i seriously can't wait to come back. 

Warning: Their hot salsa is no joke, it's nuclear hot, delicious, but nuclear hot. Even If you think you can take hot, I assure you this salsa will floor you so, be warned... ;-)"}
{"text":"This shack is authentic and delicious. They don't have a ton of variety on their menu but everything you order will be delicious! 

We got the cactus and fish tacos. Delish!!!

You can also try a free grasshopper too!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I tried three different kinds and enjoyed every single one. The only downside is that it's more of a pick up place as seating is very limited."}
{"text":"decent place. decent food. decent price.
love their salsa with chips!! very addictive."}
{"text":"I wish I had listed to Alice B.
She is right: dry meat, not particularly flavourful. Soggy tortilla. It wasn't horrible, but very meh. 

Just wanted something tasty and quick tonight. So I ignored Alice B.'s review and tried it anyway. 

Slightly strange exchange with the gentleman at the counter: He rang me through for my 2 tacos and chips which came to $11 and a bit.  After I  paid I realized I forgot to buy a drink. I smiled, said whoops and put a soda on the counter. He gave me a look like this was somehow complicated and said, \"Just give me all your change\".

I don't know why I did. But I did. Why did I do that? 

I saw that there was well over 3 bucks in my hand as I passed it to him. I asked, \"how much is the drink?\" He said it comes to \"about $3.40\"

Did I overpay for the soda? Pretty sure. By much? Not really. I was tired and it was cold. I just wanted to eat and go home. But that whole thing felt so bizarre. Why didn't he just ring it in and actually charge me what it costs? I mean, we're just standing there at the cash...it's all right there. 

He saw the expression on my face and said \"I like change.\"  No kidding! I like it too. I should have kept mine. 

Strange as it was, I was still hoping that the tacos would be worth it. But when I got back to my hotel and ate the tacos my stomach immediately turned and I felt pretty sick and uncomfortable for about 3 hours. 

If you go, I hope you have a better experience. Seems like a lot of folks dig this place."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 ---- Value: 9/10 ---- Service: 10/10 ---- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10

Ordered the fish taco with beer battered cod. It was really good. The sauce was tasty and even though I don't normally like cilantro and pineapples (or were they mangos...), they weren't overpowering and the sauce and fish were enough to make up for it. 

Tip: You can have your fish grilled instead of fried if you don't like beer battered fish.

The shop itself is really small, so there's a small bench you can eat on along the window, but there's not much space. It's definitely more of a takeout place, but there are chips and salsa while you wait for your food. 

The guy at cash was super patient in explaining what the different menu items were and how they could be customized if you didn't like one aspect or another. 

At $4.50, the fish taco is on par with other taco places downtown and it tasted great."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled across Taco 101 after a smooth disagreement about what to eat for lunch. Once we arrived, we were greeted by Jeff. Jeff noticed we were tourists and not only did he sell us the most amazing chicken and fish tacos, he also led us to other amazing eats and fun in Toronto. My 7 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed the green salsa, and usually she doesn't use salsa ever. This place was not only good for tacos, but excellent in overall service and friendliness too."}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty, simple, good sized portions and cheap. Probably one of the best taco joints I've been too."}
{"text":"Killer tacos!    Very nice staff and awesome decor.  I highly recommend this place if you are in the area or even if you are not!"}
{"text":"I actually came here last week but they had already sold out of everything by the time I got there (near closing). I chatted to one of the co-owners for a bit and found out that they hadn't anticipated so much business and it was partly because blogto had reviewed it the night prior. Although a little disappointed, I was determined that I would come back and try it.

So I did. I came here tonight with two friends and we ordered the fish taco ($4.50), al pastor taco ($4), and carnitas taco ($4) along with beans & chips ($3) and horchata ($2). All three of the tacos were fairly good and I enjoyed the diced fruits that accompanied each of them (mango in the fish, pineapple in the al pastor, and orange in the carnitas). It was a nice touch that made it more \"special\" than your average taco. The only downside was the portion size. We collectively agreed that it wasn't too filling and we would've appreciated a larger portion (especially if I compare it to Seven Lives in Kensington Market). The chips were homemade and had a nice crunch to them, but my friend had suggested, again, that they could've been more generous with the portioning of the refried beans dip. They offer 3 levels of heat for their salsa that you can add on the side but I don't have a spice tolerance so I never tried any. My friend, however, does and her commentary was that the heat was too overpowering - so much so that she couldn't really taste the heat but only feel it. Overall, I would rate the food a solid 3.5/5 but because the co-owner was so friendly and I recognize that the business is still finding its way into the market, I rounded them up. 

P.S. It's a petite store so there is no seating, there's just a ledge that you can stand along to eat."}
{"text":"This place is probably my new favourite no frills Mexican restaurant. If your craving some authentic Mexican tacos but not looking to commit to a dine in restaurant -this place is for you. The tacos here were just as I remembered from Mexico, the ma and pa taquerias, served incredibly fresh and not over the top. The \"al pastor\" is authentic, slow cooked on a spit topped with small slices of pineapple. The fish was incredibly fresh, battered and cooked as you wait -I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped into newly opened Tacos 101 for an early lunch and ordered the carnitas and al pastor tacos on corn tortillas. 

Receiving my order, I took a standing position at their window counter to unwrap my steaming hot tacos in anticipation. Biting into the al pastor taco the only word that came to mind was \"dry.\" To the point where it became a chore to eat. In the carnitas taco I found the meat tough and gristly. The shells and veggie toppings were delicious but the underlying meat troubles overshadowed this aspect."}
{"text":"Good Prices, the only downside I had was the mild was crazy hot, but that's my fault for ordering it."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Prices were very reasonable. We had a 3 or their 5 signature tacos and loved them all. My only regret is I didn't try their guacamole, but will save that for next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best tacos EVER! The fish tacos are my favorite but honestly everything here is so good! This is a MUST-TRY in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Was in the area and had many recommendations to come by to this establishment for their authentic tacos. Menu is not very grand (4 types of meat and 1 veg option) with the option of chip and salsa or guac or beans. The venue itself is very small and hard to eat your taco there especially during busy eating times such as lunch because there are really only 5 barstools around. The resturant is runned by mexicans i belive and the food here is delish. Their tacos are about 4 dollars for one with the exception of their baja fish taco (that one is like 4.50 for one). They are definitely not stingy on their meat and give you lots of protein in each taco. Also how they embellish their tacos (with cilantro, onions, guac, salsa verde, tomatos, cabbage slices) are very full and lots of toppings. My favourite from their place is the Al Pastor (Sort of like a shwarma taco) and their fish taco (though still does not beat grand electric in my opinion). So flavourful and delicious and the staff are super friendly and as a bonus they serve their homemade salsa with tortilla chips free to customers to try as they wait for their food to come.  Overall, it can get quite busy and large orders take longer to make but definitely worth the trip to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"So I never went to the Greek place that this establishment replaced, however, my SO mentioned that the taco place looks exactly like the Greek place, in that no major overhaul was done in opening this place. Not that this matters, but it's interesting.

They've got 5 tacos on the menu, two of which are pork, with 1 chicken, 1 fish (cod) and 1 fully vegetarian option. My SO had the two pork ones; Carnitas and Al Pastor. He liked them. He's said that they were pretty close to authentic tacos, just more meat in them because that's what we (Canadians) would want haha. I had the Chicken Adobado. I enjoyed this taco. There was a lot of meat; it kept coming out of the sides as I was eating. But I wouldn't want them to change that!

I also got Guac and Chips. I would not get this again. The guac was nicely presented in half an avocado skin. But that meant that there wasn't enough guac for the amount of chips in the container it's served in. The chips came in handy for my excess chicken. But the guac was so bland. It definitely need a kick.

The best part is how cheap everything is. $4 for the tacos (the fish is $4.50) and the guac and chips were $3. They also have salsa or beans and chips (as other side options).

It's a great place to get a quick taco fix and it's so close to Ryerson!"}
{"text":"Really cute takeout place! Just a few mins from Yonge and Dundas Sq. Friendly staff, generous portions and unique fizzy drinks from Mexico. You gotta try Squirt - grapefruit soda. 

I don't like their chips, sadly, they're super greasy. They also ran out of guac and the salsa had a BBQ sauce taste. Fish tacos and pork were good- decent spot for something more affordable and chill."}
{"text":"Food's good, but the tacos are pretty bland without the salsas they provide. Which isn't a problem unless you're ordering out."}
{"text":"A good option for tourists, cheap and really tasty. The tacos make me miss a little bit less my country  you can buy one taco and make two out of it!"}
{"text":"I had the carnita taco with chips and salsa. The taco was an okay size with a good amount of toppings but I really didn't like the texture of the tortilla. It was very grainy and dry. There was also a lack of seasoning. The salsa was nice. It was labeled medium but it tasted more medium. There really wasn't much spice to it at all. The chip are home made and a touch oily and thick. Overall, this place was just okay but I will give it another shot sometime later because they do have some good moments."}
{"text":"Awesome, CHEAP and authentic tacos! Have tried most on the menu and the Fish Taco is my go-to with a side of guac and chips :) Great place for a quick bite, very limited seating."}
{"text":"Awesome taco joint! Wifey and I were at Eaton Center and decided to get tacos and we were not disappointed! 

We each had the fish taco and the carnita and shared chips and salsa. The battered fish was perfectly fried with a hefty amount of slaw topping while the pork on the carnita was nice and tender. Their chips are fried in house and amazingly crispy. 

On top of the food the service was great and all staff were super friendly. 4 bucks for a generously sized taco. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hmm Toronto is certainly getting interesting with taco places to try out.
I had the veggie & fish taco. Cost me $9 something 
So the price is alright. The tacos are overflowing.
They have salsa sauce which adds more flavour and zing.
Overall I want to go back to try the others. I was pleased with the overall flavours. I didn't find it too bland but not as perfectly executed as cafe playa cabana or 7 lives but it's a worthy enough. And if you're in the area it's a good choice. But I suppose burrito boyz is nearby and you could go there instead!"}
{"text":"OMG --- it is SO good.   Place is always busy.  Not the kind of place you would go to dine in (although you can, just not that comfortable and small),  more of a take-out place, which is fine.    Portions are very generous and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Very solid taco spot! My husband and I often come here for lunch, since it's only a short drive from our work. We've tried the chicken taco, the al pastor taco, and the fish taco. The al pastor taco is our absolute favourite! The fish taco is also very tasty. The chicken taco was very good, but not my favourite. Try the al pastor taco though, the pineapple is amazing in it! Their spicy hot sauce is actually very spicy - I love it! A lot of places lack in the spice factor even if they claim to be very spicy."}
{"text":"I think this is another one of those hidden gems. This location use to be a Greek Gyro place, now it is Tacos 101. The menu is not large and the prices are inexpensive. They use soft corn tortillas, which I think is much better than the soft white tortillas. I originally wanted to order the Al Pastor taco, but they were all out. So I ordered the Carnitas instead. My boyfriend ordered the Fish taco and the Nopal taco. The Carnitas taco was a slow cooked pork shoulder taco and the Nopal is their vegetarian taco with cactus in it. I liked the Carnitas taco, the pork shoulder was slow cooked till it was melt in your mouth and topped with fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde. For each Taco they give you quite a bit of filling. 
They also make their own chips for the sides if you wanted to order sides with your taco. 
This is also a grab and go place. They do have seating in the front by the window but there is like only 5 to 6 seats. 
I definitely enjoyed the tacos here. Next time, I am going to go early so that I can get the Al Pastor taco."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and the fish taco is my favourite, it's ridiculously scrumptious. The ingredients are always fresh, cooked well, and flavourful. I just really like coming here, although there is hardly ever room to sit and eat because it's such a small place. I love these tacos and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I had the carnita and fish. 

Both tacos were decorated and dressed like the cover of a magazine. The taste matched the look. 10/10 

Fish was really tasty. It didn't need tomato so I picked it off but overall very good

Carnita has so much flavour I liked that more. Next time I will try more. 

The only downside is the seating. 4 bar stools at a window. I would like to sit down and order because then I would try more."}
{"text":"So happy i discovered this little piece of heaven.

it's so festive and cute, just what i needed on a cold January canadian night. I had one of each taco, it was all very tasty. since i'm a seafood fiend, i loved the fish taco the most! 

they piled up the toppings all the way in the form of a little mountain on top of the tortilla.... mmmm! 

pick it up, chomp it down, lick the fingers, and wash it down with some hibiscus drink. all of that while you are surrounded by colorful lights and lucha libre masks - it's a bit of mexicana magic right here. 

there's only like six seats - teeny shop."}
{"text":"Best taco in the city. Fish is super fresh and crunchy. Pastor is perfectly seasoned and juicy. HUGE portion for the money at only $4-$4.50. Don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"Downtown T-Dot Staycation over the Xmas Holidays!  Was walking back from the LCBO and what do I see?  Tacos 101!!!   Small Taco joint with no parking.  Very limited seating.  Free samples of their house made nachos and sauces.  Hot, medium and mild.  Sample the sauces with the comp Nachos before pouring it on.  Ordered 4 Fish Tacos (Battered).  After the wife and I consumed two tacos each, we were beached.  The portion of fish in each taco is huge as is the flavor.  Dayaam they were delicious.  Garnished with Slaw and Yellow Relish (Pineapple?) these tacos were heavenly.  I hit this place up two days in a row.  Consistency?  YES.  The fish tacos come standard with the mild sauce.  You can fill up little take-out containers with their house made sauces.  Remember peeps, Chips likes it hot.  The in house hot sauce was \"bite you in the ass the next day hot\" so beware. Would I go back?  They had me after the first bite.  
Peace my brothers and sisters."}
{"text":"I love the al pastor taco at this place, plus the price is very reasonable being only 4$ per taco. I love coming here for lunch since it's so close to where I study. 
The wait times are usually not long either, which is great! Love this place, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times as it is just across the street from my condo building and rather convenient, but I just can't get behind the tacos here.  It's too bad, because if they were decent I would be in here all the time! 

The menu is averagely priced for a taco but the tacos themselves are nothing special. The meat is usually dry and flavourless, the toppings lacklustre and the corn tortillas often a little soggy. 

I would say save your appetite and head over to Kensington Market to have a taco at Seven Lives Tacquiera where the fillings are abundant and the food is much more creative at the same price."}
{"text":"Cheap and a good meal, I tried the chicken and pork ... it was alright. Their mild isn't spicy at all, probably will try a little spicier next time. The meat itself didn't taste marinated so I was a little disappointed but for 8$ I had two tacos and was full for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Got to try three different non-vegetarian tacos (they have four options). As many other reviewers mentioned, the price here is unbeatable. Each taco is $4-4.5 (before tax). Felt like the fish taco could use more acidity to cut off the greasiness from the fish. Chicken taco (forgot the name) was okay, the chicken was on the dry side. My favorite was the pork one with pineapple. The meat was cooked on point with lots of flavour to it. I would give 3/5 for tacos. Their chips were good 4/5. I wouldn't say this place serves the best taco in town, but because it is so cheap, I would say it is worth to try if you are in the area and looking for a quick bite. Quick and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"These tacos are as close as it gets to food truck tacos in Austin on east 6th street."}
{"text":"There are tons of awesome Tex-Mex joints in Toronto, so you have to do something awesome to stand out. Tacos 101 does that, and so much more.

I've had the opportunity to try the Al Pastor, Carnitas, and Chicken Adobado throughout my multiple visits to Tacos 101. Since they're four dollars each and rather small, you should look to order 2 or 3 tacos in total, unless you're just dropping by for a quick snack.

Each of the three tacos has have diced fruit placed on top of it, and what this does is add a nice layer of sweetness to each of the tacos. As I mentioned before, the tacos are rather small, but they are jam-packed with zest. I honestly love each taco equally, and all of them are awesome down to the last bite.

One thing you do have to remember is that not all of the tacos are going to be available all the time. For example, 2/3 times I went, the Carnitas were sold out. If you want to try the full suite of tacos available on the menu, try to limit your visit to peak hours. You might be disappointed otherwise."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice. the vibe is nice, tortillas are excellent as is the housemade salsa and chips. 

The reason I give 3 stars is because I dont find the pork to be too flavourful and generally on the dry side. The portions are good but I think if you want something that will blow you away go to Seven Lives in Kensington Market. Otherwise if you are just hungry and have a taco craving for something more authentic than most places in T.O, Go here."}
{"text":"I like that they have gluten free soft tacos and that I can get a vegan one with cactus, onion, tomato, guacamole and beans that's really great tasting and fresh. Many taco places have wheat in their corn tacos so I'm happy to have found a place I trust. Not as fancy as Barrio (who puts Morita oil on the guacamole) but great value for the money and good people."}
{"text":"If you park, pay. Lots of tickets given our2 around here. I like the simplicity, a few tacos to choose from. I had chicken and pork, would definitely get both again. 
Nice find."}
{"text":"I've gone here 3 times in 3 weeks?  It's pretty good.  My faves are the fish taco and one of the meat ones, but I totally forget the name.  I think it's Al pastor.  I agree with Al L, the Al Pastor was a little dry this week, but in previous weeks its been fine.  2 tacos are a good size for lunch.  I was pretty full afterwards.  My coworker got his taco with no onions.  I'm going to try that next time.

It's tasty here, and I'm totally coming back."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall that serves tasty, authentic and inexpensive tacos.  Staff are friendly.  The guac and sauces are awesome!"}
{"text":"Found this little place through Yelp. Staffs are nice and friendly.
Small little place with a few sittings.
Just check out the photos. They all taste OK.
And if you are driving down there. Dalhousie Street is next to them. Meter parking there."}
{"text":"The taco onslaught just seems to never end in this town with at least one new place popping up every other weekend. Seems like I've brought back a little bit of California with me.

This is a tiny one; space wise. With barely enough stools to fit 5 burly men and maybe a sixth petite lady; this place packs a lot of punch for it's size. One glance over the counter and you would not doubt their authenticity as you do witness 2 serious Mexican chefs at the helm. The menu is simple and straightforward consisting of a handful of tacos such as pork, pork chicken and fish. In comparison to other fancier places their tacos are great value. While the price is inline with most establishments, these guys give you lots and lots of meat.

Therein lies the caveat; too much meat. Rarely do I come to this conclusion as a carnivore but when the tacos are meatier than your grandmother's meatloaf.. it's a little daunting. You see Mexican cuisine isn't about whacking your guests over the head with an 18oz tomahawk steak and putting them into a potato choke hold -- a la cocina americana. It's about balance I would say; the ying and the yang. When I think of tacos, I think of delicious meat with a great balance of crispy, sweet and fresh vegetables, a good dose of chilis and ultimately that hit of acid at the end to cleanse your palette. Taco 101 has the meat component nailed down (albeit a little on the dry side) but it's the rest they need to work on; getting that flavour seesaw leveled.

All in all, a place worthy of a quick snack due to the tremendous value. Taste wise, they are in the middle of the road."}
{"text":"This place was the first stop on a small food tour with around Dundas St East. The space is small inside a la the same dimensions as most of the eateries in Kensington Market but enough there is some ample sitting space and also enough space to move around.

Our group of four given a basket of complimentary tortilla chips with three different dipping sauce the spiciest of which was really no joke, as the own had given us a friendly warning about it. Haha, well heat from the pepper used in that sauce scared off the chill from my bones. But I also need to counter the heat on my tongue so decided to get one of the two in-house Aqua Frescas. I decided on the Horchata a concoction of rice, vanilla, cinnamon and almond milk which tasted distinctly of bubble gum when I took the first sip, and it was light and refreshing and obliterated the remnants of the hot sauce from my tongue.

I liked the sound of the Chicken Adobado but it was still in the second stages of cooking so I ended up \"tasting\" one of the extra Al Pastors that my friends had sitting at the table with them. I didn't really savor this taco but I did fill me up (I had not eaten anything before getting here) and our group all agreed on that. The owner did let me know that I could return to pick up the Chicken Adobado taco on him later in the day which I did. I had that for breakfast today and the meat was tender like it had been braised and the pico de gallo complimented the flavor of the meat. But I really bet it would taste a lot better when eaten right at the place. 

So I did end up getting to try two different tacos for the purpose of getting one and neither one disappointed. The sauces for the chips also had their own distinct flavors at first bite. The Horchata was refreshing even on a chill day. The products worked out well for my palette.

I will be stopping by here when I'm in the Dundas Square area next time."}
{"text":"A co-worker had recommended this place and I was excited. It was a bit of a walk east of Dundas, but you won't miss it. It's very colourful.

- The tacos were $4 each (the fish was $4.50). Salsa and chips were $2.50.
- We decided to pre-order by calling in for pick up, but they didn't take our order and told us to call in 15 mins prior to pick up time. This was very inconvenient. 
- My co-worker wanted no avocado in her tacos, they warned her that it may contain \"avocado water\"... Strange. I wanted avocado in mines and didn't get any :(
- My Al Pastor taco was dry, and there was only one small piece of pineapple.
- The fish taco was good. I'd order this again. 
- I really liked the chips and salsa. Decent portions and the salsa tasted fresh.

The place was very cute, colourful and small. No tables to sit down at, just 4 barstools by the window. I'd recommend walk-in and takeaway only.

Overall, it is a decent taco place. I'm sad I didn't get any guac/avocado, but just a one-off. Always check your tacos before leaving!
Possibly the only place nearby for decent fish tacos, so I might be back."}
{"text":"Went to their pop-up at Adelaide Eats and was somewhat disappointed. During the pop-up tacos are $5 each instead of the regular $4 in-restaurant (but the pop-up price includes tax so really it's only a 50 cent markup). I tried the carnitas taco and while the taco was a decent size the pork was incredibly dry and almost flavourless and there were hardly any toppings to boost the flavour."}
{"text":"A consistently delicious, authentic Mexican cantina-style place with a Dundas East kind of shabbiness to it. These guys do it right."}
{"text":"I came to think place for a quick bite. I ordered the fish tacos, as they are there best sandwich according to the server. The fish was fried, with lots of other toppings. the sandwich was good and well priced. they donot have larger sandwiches which I wish they did because I was hungry. otherwise the food was tasty . they have sampling for the sauces they have which is nice. the place is small and tight so it's more of a take out place. will recommend people to try it."}
{"text":"Great service but the tacos were not what I expected! I got the Fish and Carnitas, the fish tacos was not as good as I expected but def better than the Carnitas. Too many onions in both tacos and the guac was not fresh, seemed like it was watered down. the Carnitas lacks flavour and is way too dry. I'll definetly come back and try something else in the menu as the staff were very very nice!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The place isn't that hard to find, it's beside Ryerson university close to the engineering building. It's a pretty small place but what they offer here is nothing small in terms of flavour or portion size! 

These were the best tacos I've ever had (although I haven't had that many tacos to begin with). I ordered 

This place is super authentic. Everything from the salsa they offer, to the types of tacos (it's not a long and confusing menu!), to the decor, right to the very people making your tacos. Oh right, I also forgot to mention that EVERYTHING is homemade and fresh (salsa, guacamole, and even the taco itself!).

I ordered the fish and chicken taco. I wanted to get their \"al pastor\" or pork taco but they ran out of pork and I had to wait a few minutes before they had it again. There's nothing wrong with that! Except for the fact that I was in a bit of a rush that day. 

The flavours are unique, the protein was perfectly cooked, there are different textures with the various condiments they put on top (you don't get to choose what condiments they put, but if you don't like something or have allergies, be sure to tell them!), the corn tortilla or taco itself is so good that I can probably eat it just on its own. The corn tortilla or taco (sorry for my lack of knowledge about the taco) is warm, soft, and has a real authentic corn flavour to it. 

The tacos are decently sized but they definitely don't shy away from the actual protein! After you get your tacos, you get choose additional salsa to put on it (or dip in). Just to warn you, the bottle with a stronger orange colour is VERY SPICY. I love spicy stuff and even I found out spicy. So, if don't want to kill your taste buds and start sweating like mad, go with the other bottle (it's slightly red/brownish in colour). Both are excellent in flavour and I forgot what the salsas were called, but the spice level is on a different level between the two bottles!

I think this place is a great addition to the multicultural food scene of Toronto and I am even more glad that it is close to where I live!"}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly from the second you walk in. Free nachos and dip (hopefully people don't double dip). Ordered the fish and carnitas tacos. The fish was delicious. Excellent tasting fish and sauces. The carnitas though was just ok in my opinion. The meat was fairly dry that night. Otherwise, this place is great. Reminiscent of So Cal style tacos."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tacos from this lil shack. I ordered a fish taco and chips & salsa. The fish taco was really good with unique flavours and I was surprised to see some mango in there. The chips are different from regular tortilla chips so that was nice, and the salsa has a bit of a kick but it isn't too spicy, which I like. The only downside is that the actual place is literally a shack--very tiny, not much seating, and no AC, so on a hot day, expect to sweat buckets. I know Ryerson University is nearby so I feel like this is a good takeout option for students. Would recommend for all the taco lovers out there."}
{"text":"Came here as a cold walk-in and was pleasantly surprised. It's a cramped space with only a few chairs available, so perhaps plan accordingly. I had the fish and chicken tacos. For starters, the tacos are quite large, so 2 could easily fill you up. Ingredients were fresh and well distributed so as to not slip out of the tortillas. Batter around the fish was not overwhelming. Chicken was tender and flavorful. 

Overall I'd recommend this place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas and fish taco.  I agree with many fellow Yelp reviewers that the pork on the carnitas was a tad dry. I was dumping a lot of their 'medium' sauce on it give it some flavour. Their medium sauce tasted like a BBQ sauce; It was tasty and a little smoky.

Caution: Their hot sauce is really spicy!!

The fish taco was great. I think it was because it was cooked to order (my carnitas taco was ready before the fish). It was hot and crispy and the chipotle aioli was very tasty and was a nice cooling element. I only wish they put more of the aioli. At times all I had was cabbage, fish and tortilla and this was a little dry.

They use corn tortillas which hold up well and have a nice chew. It also has that distinct corn tortilla flavour. 

This is a very cramped space with very limited seating. 

I will be back to try the other tacos - but the fish taco saved the day."}
{"text":"Was craving tacos and stumbled onto this place online and decided to go. Tacos are great! Fish taco is to die for and veggie one is awesome also. Nice cute place wth great prices and delicious food. Highly recommended for a tasty bite."}
{"text":"- What I have tried: ALL from the menu lol. My two favourites are Al Pastor and Cartinas. I thought the fish taco was ok, but apparently it's the most expensive one 
- Food quality: extremely good. Toppings, meat and sauces all blend very well together, nothing to complain about.
- Drink: I only tried the Guava one (it's actually a glass bottle, not house-made guava tho). I thought it was ok, definitely not worth $3
- Portion: generous amount of meat and toppings, but I usually need 2 tacos to be completely full
- Price: $4 each except fish taco which is $4.50. I think the price is fair
- The place is very small so not a lot of seats. However people are in and out a lot so there is always space.
- Overall, I would come back :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this adorable little taco shop off busy Dundas Street East. Off the bat, it looked like it had a lot of potential; the reviews online were good, and the place felt cosy and authentic. 

Service was great and prompt. My only qualm was with the tacos themselves. We ordered two fish tacos, a pork and a chicken. The tacos looked great. Bigger sizes than what you normally get at places like La Carnita and at about half the price (around $4.50 each). 

The fish tacos were probably the best of the three. I liked that they included a piece of grilled pineapple which I thought was pretty unique and tasty. The actual fish portion was mostly batter. I probably got two mouthfuls of batter so it ended up tasting pretty unhealthy and greasy. The chicken and the pork tacos were nothing to write home about. The meat lacked taste and the taco was very flat flavour-wise. 

Compared to other taco places like La Carnita and Seven Lives, the food here just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"My bf and I always pass by this place when we take the street car and I've always noticed just how busy the spot was. I finally convinced my bf that we should try the spot out this past Monday and we surely didn't regret the visit! Everything was rather delicious and we were pleased to have our tacos packed and loaded with meat/fish/veggies - we got one of each taco, a bag of chips and guac, and to drink my bf got a Jarritos and I got a hibiscus drink! In order of what stood out as the most delicious taco is as followed: the cactus (we actually didn't consider ordering this at first but was wowed by the flavors!), fish (was crisp and so good!) and carnitas (a classic must have) - top off the tacos with your choice of their hot sauce and bam - you've got a mouth watering taco!

The spot is rather small with limited seating, but the tacos portion size and flavor truly make up for it. The prices of the tacos I believe were worth it as they ranged from $4-4.50 (all tacos were $4, the fish was $4.50). Will deffinetly be back!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall with delicious and very authentic feeling tacos. We arrived minutes before they opened on a saturday, and were in the door right at 11:30am. By the time we left 30 minutes later, the place was full, and people were still coming in. They didn't have everything ready when we got there, so if you want the full selection, I'd advise getting there closer to 12pm. It's kitschy cute, but not a place to sit for a long time. 

The tacos are huge, and come with two tortillas, so they can essentially be split into two tacos instead of one overstuffed taco. There is also hot and medium salsa on the side to add more spice (hot is actually quite spicy!) The al pastors are amazing and super flavourful! The nopal (cactus) was good, but more of a novelty food. Each taco is garnished with its own pairings, so each is very different. 

I didn't get to try the fish this time, but I will definitely be back to try them! NOMNOMNOM"}
{"text":"I am very happy that this joint has opened up in our neighbourhood, it's refreshing to not see another shawarma, sushi, ramen nor bubble tea joint open up!

The food is really good quality and authentic. Also the serving sizes are really big!

The chips + salsas are amazing, but my fiance has celiac disease so he can't have the chips as they fry items with wheat in the same fryer :( ... Hoping they will change this, so he can eventually eat the chips!"}
{"text":"I had fish tacos! Fast service, great tacos and the place was packed"}
{"text":"This little gem in the heart of downtown Toronto serves the most authentic tacos I've ever had. I went on a Sunday evening and it was packed with many customers. The place is tiny with very limited seating so I had my tacos to go. I ordered Al pastor and fish taco. Both were so flavourful and the fish had just the perfect crunch to it. Also they were very filling. Definitely going back to try out their other tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a few people , so had to try it. Definitely worth it and taste was amazing and who doesn't like a huge taco pulled high for 5 bucks. They also have some great homemade salsa I tried, the hot was so good. If your in the area give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My favourite Tacos in Toronto. They're large tacos 1-2 are a full meal for myself and well priced all around $5. All of the kinds are great but of course I have my favourites. They're gluten free other than the fish taco which is important to me.  The staff are very friendly and fast and the atmosphere is authentic. There is minimal sitting room but that doesn't bother me at all, in the warmer months the seating is doubled with outdoor space. I have gotten over 20 tacos from this place and they have been consistently excellent every time. 
Highly recommended Tacos 101"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a quick bite since I heard their tacos are good. I ordered El Pastor which is a pulled pork taco with pineapple and salsa. My partner had the chicken taco. Pork meat was nicely seasoned, unfortunately it was a bit dry. The chicken meat sas not dry, which was good. Their salsa is very good, however be careful with the hot one as it might be too much for some people. In front they have a bowl of tortilla chips together with mild, medium and hot salsa to try. Overall, the tacos are pretty good and service is fast. Place is tiny so don't expect to get any seat at rush hour. 
I give this place 4 stars. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that although the flavour was there, the meat was a little dry. However, it's definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The best tacos on this side of the city and amazing service. Best suited for takeout. 

Try the homemade Horchata - to die for!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I'd like to say there are better tacos than Tacos 101 and I've had plenty in Toronto (pork tacos were quite fatty - Ordered beef, pork, and cactus)!  After I paid over $23.73 for over-priced 5 tacos, I expect at least average service.  The cashier, whom I suspect is an owner or at least he acted like he thinks he's a big guy, had light coloured hair/blonde Caucasion in 30s, a bit out of shape was extremely RUDE.  I explained my order a few times because he didn't listen and when he finally understood, he was just a rude.  No hello or even thank you me for helping him make money.  FINE.  On top of this, when I asked if I had the medium hot sauce bottle because I wanted to put sauce on my food, he said yes and \"ORDERED/TOLD\" ME TO FILL SAUCE INTO HIS EMPTY DIP BOWL!!!!  Yes you read correctly.  These dip bowls were at the counter, beside him for customers to dip chips inside to try the salsa sauces.  I don't care how busy it was.  Asking (especially rudely asking) a customer to do your dirty work is offensive."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty good. I had the pork and chicken tacos, but the pork was not up to my standards. The guac and chips were also really yummy, but my friend thought the chips were a little over-greased. Would visit again when I am craving tacos and guac!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent tacos, reasonable prices, solid lunch option.

Walked past this place on my way to getting ramen one day, and made a note of it. Finally made it here and am happy to say it is a other solid lunch spot at under 10 dollars. 2 tacos is enough to fill you up and most tacos are around 4 dollars. I tried the fish and the al pastor. I'd definitely go back as I left satisfied. Not sure what else to say... Seems authentic? :)"}
{"text":"Finally gave this a try. Food was ok but for the price, I can't complain. Waiting can be a while during lunch time so arrive early. I came in 5 minutes before noon and have been done eating before the fifth person in the line behind me got their food. Maybe a fluke? I was there for a good 20 minutes.

Bottom line, I think this is for students on a budget or those who needs ample amount of calories per dollar-spent to go through the day and taste is secondary."}
{"text":"I am not a huge taco kinda guy (burritos are the way to go), but I did want to try this place out. It has that \"kiosk chic\" kind of feel to it, as it literally is as big as a kiosk. You are able to sit outside as they have a fully open-able window - basically you sit outside facing in. I kind of liked that. I also enjoyed the portion sizes, as many people commented on here already. They are quite sizeable. I had three tacos and was super full, which is not the case usually with taco places. So kudos for that.

On the other hand, the tacos were just ok. I thoroughly enjoyed the Al Pastor, which was by far the most superior one. The other two I tried (Carnitas and Chicken Adobado) were just forgettable. Somehow they had no kick and the flavour just wasn't there. Not bad by any means, but I could have just had three Al Pastors and I would've been great. 
The thing that stood out to me the most is actually the free salsa - it is DELICIOUS! It has a nice smoky flavour, which is just excellent. 

I would only go back for the Al Pastor and to maybe try their fish taco or the other ones I haven't tried before. The decor is super cute and \"authentic\" (take it how you want), but it's a tiny place. You'll probably end up just taking out and eating somewhere else. I just had my tacos at the Ryerson quad, it's only a minute walk away."}
{"text":"Just tacos.  I've tried each of the five varieties and they are all excellent.  Lots of meat etc.  Very tasty and well seasoned.  At a reasonable $4 a piece, I highly recommend this place for taco enthusiasts.  Very limited seating."}
{"text":"These tacos are okay. They are very large, and two is enough for a meal. While it may be headed in the right direction, I wouldn't say they're the most authentic tacos but fairly tasty. I had fish taco and al pastor. The fish was flakey but the al pastor was a dry, so a bit disappointing. 

Prices are about $4 a taco, but since they're fairly large, its a good deal. Two tacos and a horchata was about $11ish. The horchata was okay, but a bit too grainy for my liking. 

The place was pretty busy, with a constant flow of blue and white collar workers coming in for lunch. Seating is limited - counter space for about 5-6 people, but it seems like most people get their tacos to go. Service was friendly and fairly efficient."}
{"text":"Had the following items:
- fish tacos
- chicken adobafo
- quac and chips side

My opinion:
This place is a definitely recommended. The quac and chips were fresh and the taco portion sizes were good enough.  The added sauces help alot. Definitely coming back to try the vegetarian taco and the salsa side."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get tacos in downtown Toronto. Al pastor and carnitas are my preferences. Authentic to Mexican style, great variety of sauces. Place is a little small, best to avoid busy hours."}
{"text":"The Fish Taco: yum! Tacos 101 keeps their fish taco sweet and simple but man is it good. An on point delicious classic. I got one of the cactus and that was good too - but I ended up wishing I had just gotten two of the fish. Gobbled it down!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Service: The place is very small with limited window seats and counter service. You order on one side and wait to pick up your food on the other side of the counter. The girl at cash was friendly and helpful, no complain. Bonus - they have grasshoppers and chips and salsa you can snack on while waiting for your food!

Drink: We got a guava soda bottle from the fridge, and loved it! It was not too sweet and very refreshing, especially if you love guavas!

Food: We ordered the El Pastor, Chicken Adobado, and Nopal cactus tacos.

Everything came with 2 tortillas which is great because the portion is HUGE, things will DEFINITELY fall off as you eat, and makes a second taco with the extra tortilla!

Everything tasted good, but no big flavour bombs. However, the meat tacos lacked the \"Mexican flavour\" I typically get from other taco places, it tasted very like shawarma style meat.

Overall: it didn't have any taco flavours I was looking for, but would return for some cheap and filling food if I'm nearby!"}
{"text":"We found his place through Yelp after having a craving for tacos. So glad we gave it a try. It's been 2 weeks and we've had it twice. I have a feeling this is going to be a weekly meal for us. 
First of all, the portions are great. Two tacos and you're full. Really. Be careful with the orangey colour habanero hot sauce. It's really spicy. If you can't handle spice, don't do it. 
My favourite is the chicken, al pastor and battered cod. We also love the chips and salsa. 
The al pastor pork pairs really well with the pineapple and the coleslaw is delicious with the cod. 
Lots of small food shops come and go.  Hope this one sticks around for a very long time."}
{"text":"Had the veggie/vegan taco. Super yummy!  Flavourful and the staff were friendly and very funny.  I randomly came across this place while running an errand. I am glad I stumbled upon this place.  I can't wait to go back. 

P.S.  The place is small, so there is limited seating as an FYI"}
{"text":"It's over hyped. So many better taco places in the city to go to. Ordered 2 pork 1 chicken and 1 fish taco. Flavorless, no spice and super dry. Meat is over cooked and fillings unsavoury. For what you pay $4 per taco go to grand electric or LA carnita"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for afternoon work snacks. Pretty solid. Love the tacos. Chips are heavy: I recommend feeding them to your colleague."}
{"text":"Having read about Tacos 101 in Blog TO, I was looking forward to trying a new taco joint downtown. 
It's a tiny place with a small menu and they do tacos very well. The service is friendly and helpful - we were about to order 3 tacos each when it was kindly suggested that we may want to start with two - good call. They were very filling and flavourful. 
The tacos (except the beer battered fish taco) are gluten free. The chips are not as they are fried in the same fryer as the fish. We had the chicken adobado and the carnitas. I'm looking forward to going back and trying different ones. The prices are very reasonable - dinner for two (4 tacos and 2 bottles of water) was just under $30 including tip."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this place, but my last two experiences here has really killed it for me. Wherever I eat, I always ask for no onions. I know this annoys some, but I am not the only person in the world that cannot eat an ingredient. And I will eat ANYTHING! Just not onions. 

When I started coming to Tacos 101 I would request that they omit the pico de gallo because I can't eat onions. Every time they had a hard time understanding what I meant. I know, it must have sounded insane to ask for tacos with no pico de gallo. And I would have loved tomatoes etc. on my taco, but I know the onion is mixed with it already. Anyway, most of the time they got it right. My order would always be a fish taco and an al pastor. The fish taco would come with cabbage and mayo, and the pork would have an avocado spread, cilantro and pineapple. 

Two weeks ago I ordered 4 tacos to go, and asked that two have no onions. I explained it several times to the guy making the tacos and the girl at the cash. I knew they understood because they spoke in Spanish, I am Spanish, so I understood the order she gave the cook. Feeling confident that it would all be okay, I took the tacos to go, and when I opened them with my boyfriend, only one had no onions, so my boyfriend ate my second one. They messed up the order even after breaking it down in two languages.

For the first time today I ordered tacos from Tacos 101 using a delivery service, and in the section where you are supposed to give the restaurant instructions, I asked, in caps for no onions. When I received my order, every taco was swimming in onions. Immediately after seeing them in there, I became sick and had to throw them out. I contacted the delivery company and they asked the restaurant to make them again. The new order had tortillas, pork and fish. No toppings!! Are you kidding me???!!! I literally got four dry tacos. Not even herbs!

This experience made me feel like they were insulting me and mocking me. I am not a picky eater. There is just one thing I cannot eat. Please have some respect. 

Needless to say, I am never returning. What a shame.

Update: I lied - the last four tacos did have some toppings buried in it - chunks of raw white onion. Wow"}
{"text":"Tacos 101 is a great place to go if you love tacos, you know that they are for real because of their use corn tortillas. 

They have a great balance between the toppings, sauces, and meats. It provides for a tasteful experience, at a price that one can't really complain about. 

I've used Ritual to order ahead on two occasions and have had a great experience with it also. 

If you're looking for tacos this is a good safe bet."}
{"text":"So I went here during my exam review week with my cousin, it was a little more expensive than most taco places of I've been to. Usually they do orders of 3-5 but instead was price per taco. The al pastor was amazing, and the carnita as well, but holy moly was the chipotle hot sauce(I think that's what it was) they have on the counter hotter than hell... I had to open up a window in my car, I felt it in my brain (no joke) lol

Nonetheless the food was great but super cramped in there. Likely unable to sit and eat because it's right by Ryerson and 2 mins from Yonge and Dundas!"}
{"text":"These tacos are fantastic. Good size for the price, which I can't say about everywhere in the city. Two is a hearty size for lunch, but won't leave you feeling gross. One is just enough to hit the spot. The menu is limited, but perfect for indecisive folks like me. I had a fish taco as well as a bite of my boyfriend's Al Pastor. Both were delicious. 

Very fast (less than 3 minutes) and nice service, although tacos were thrown together a little haphazardly. Their hot sauce is really spicy. Cute dining space - seats limited but has a cozy charm, felt authentic albeit slightly cheesy (lucha libre toys etc). Would come back in good time."}
{"text":"Can be easily overlooked, it's on Dundas, 300m to the square. A tiny spot offering 4 types of taco: al pastor, carnitas, chicken adobado and fish all $4 except fish which is $4.5. Slow cooked pork was so soft and delicious with right amount of spice and ingredients. The chips were OK. 

The highlight about the place is that they make their own salsa. Mild, normal and spicy they are categorized and they are more on the runny side. They taste damn good though.

They have WiFi and limits seating inside and outside. Better to order for pick-up or delivery. 4 stars due to lack of seating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... possibly the best Horchata in Toronto and their Al Pastor is quite good.

One Sunday we did a Taco showdown of 2 of the more popular taco places in Toronto.  We already did Seven Lives and Grand Electric (plus 2 others we wont mention).  So we decided to try Tacos 101 & Wilbur to see how they stacked up to my experiences in Chicago and San Diego.  

I know there are 3 groups of people who have strong thoughts about tacos... I'll just ignore the ones who dont like them in this review.  The first group is all about the street tacos... the ones you find a mom and pop shop grinding out the best savoury flavours for a few dollars and they dont look pretty but they're just solid with recipes going back generations.  Then you have the ones that are re-inventing them... using the shells as edible packaging to bring out new flavours and visual wow factor.  And then you have people who love taco bell... I'm going to ignore that group too. 

Tacos 101 sit perfectly in the Street Tacos scene... true to the original flavours that come out of these tiny stores run by a Mexican family.  With their smaller menu, they offer the traditional greats like Carnitas and Al Pastor. They also have a few interesting offering ... a vegetarian cactus (Nopal), the Baja favourite of crispy fish, and a chicken one.  They do have their in house made drinks... get one.  Really.

The place is quite small... with no tables but bar seating facing the window.  Maybe at most 6 seats.  It's bright and bold with the vivid Mexican wrestling masks painted everywhere.  It's a fun bright place even in the dead of winter.  We got our order figured out and the service is super friendly and cheerful.  

Carnitas - Tender pork topped with a salsa and pico de gallo which is a mixture of tomato, onions, cilantro, and peppers.  This was a good taco that sat on a soft corn shell.  3.5/5

Al Pastor - Pork with more of a grilled finish and topped with salsa, cilantro, and pineapple.  This brought the sweet and savoury and made it the preferred pork taco between the two.  4/5

(Baja) Fish - This one was unfortunately not cooked as well. The fish was lukewarm and the batter was soft and soggy.  I'm not sure if the oil was not hot or that it was premade and then, used later.  Either way, the fish taco was definitely missing the hot crunch I love when eating them in San Diego.  As for flavour, it wasn't bad.  I had to add some of the heat to bring it up but I just wish they made the fish fresh. 2/5

Horchata - YES!! It has been ages since I've had a good horchata.  Last time I had it was in San Diego and every time I've had it since then... watery or too sugary.  This was perfect.  Nice creaminess with lots of good cinnamon and a healthy dose of sugar.  This just tastes so good... perfect if you use too much heat from the hot salsas.  5/5

For all 3 tacos, they were good sizes... you wont feel starved if you have an order of 2.  Also, if you like a bit of heat... use the medium one.  The very hot is REALLY hot... and only use a smidge. Unless you like pain on your tongue, then this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"$5.50 + tax for 1 fish taco. 

They do pile on the toppings and it is edible.
1 makes a good snack, but I wouldn't do 2 for something like lunch as it tastes pretty bland.

Staff are friendly, and service is really quick."}
{"text":"Loved the tacos! Taste like real
Mexican tacos. The place is too small though, which they has a bigger space where to sit."}
{"text":"Went in to grab some lunch. Surprised that I was able to find some seating. I had the Al Pastor(pork) and fish taco with some guac and chips. The fish taco ($4.5) was delicious as was the Al Pastor($4). The guac ($3) was very tasty and they give you a very generous portion of chips. All prices are tax inclusive.
They also put out a bowl of chips that are free for tasting the many salsas they have. 
Overall, very satisfied with my lunch. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time this week for lunch. I had the fish and the al pastor, both of which were very good. Not quite at the level of Seven Lives, but close, and cheaper. I would definitely recommend if you're in the area. Very little seating inside but I ate on the outdoor ledge which was great."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've tried in the city, particularly the al pastor. But at $4-$4.50 each, they strike me as a bit pricey given the no-frills setup, postage stamp-sized store, and location.

Also, there is a huge lack of seating -- only 5 or 6 spots at the window -- which is a problem when people sit around \"savoring\" their meal and taking a dozen pictures for Instagram. Eat your damn tacos and get out of there...shouldn't take more than 8 minutes."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 fresh, big, tasty

Service 4/5 take plastic, friendly, quick, a bit small 

Location 5/5 downtown, paid street parking

Price 5/5 $4 per taco

Will be back"}
{"text":"Got the El Pastor and the Fish taco. The fish was baller good and el pastor, meh. Cute, storefront; limited seating (bar style seating for about 5 people), so good take out place."}
{"text":"Small place and limited menu, mostly take away but amazing tacos and sauces. Priced right."}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion. The tacos were alright. I've definitely had better. I tried the chicken adobado and el pastor. The meat was a quite dry for both of them. I'm a saucy person, so my rating comes from the fact that all of their topping and sauces (without exceptions) were on point. 

Excellent location, fairly clean spot and very friendly staff. 

This place isn't going to be my go to spot but I do want to try the other things on their menu. Luckily, it's a small menu."}
{"text":"Very authentic tacos. 

Highlight: the tacos here are comparable to tacos in Mexico and San Diego!! Very unique flavours too, for eg I got the fish taco and they added mango in there to spice things up. Very affordable. 

Only thing is this place is very small, it resembles a shack and so I would not recommend going in large groups. It's more of a solo venture or best as takeout."}
{"text":"Loved the fish tacos and carnitas! Guac and chips were fresh and tasty! Also enjoyed the homemade hibiscus drink."}
{"text":"One word ..delicious 

I got the pulled pork taco and chicken taco! Both were very tasty."}
{"text":"Love the price and the speed of the food but not sure where the 4-stars came from as it's not bad but it's not that good either it's so-so. I had the carnitas while my boyfriend tried all of them with meat in it and we thought the same (and he loves tacos!) Good if you have a quick craving for tacos but there are better ones out there."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are incredible.  Very good value, tacos are huge.  The Guac you get with the chip order is quite good as well."}
{"text":"Tried all but the cactus tacos. My favs are the chicken adobado and the fish taco (grilled not battered). Generally great all around with a very authentic taste and preparation. A bit pricey but the tacos themselves are a healthy size. Three are a perfect meal size if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Easy. The food is good, the service was fast, and the menu is so simple a small child could figure it out. The place is quite small, so I would advise take out - or going at a non peak time so you don't get stuffed into the small place. Definitely go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This tiny joint serves affordable tacos that are generous in portion size and authentic in preparation as well. The only negative here is that the taste of their tacos tend to be a bit on the bland side. Despite using spit-grilled pork to prepare their al pastor tacos, the meat was fairly dry and tasted unseasoned. The same could be said of their fish tacos too, which I found to be lacking in flavour. 

They have made some strides in improving their food, however, since the time of their opening. I notice that they now add a generous amount of pineapple to both their fish and al pastor tacos. This ingredient certainly adds a much needed kick of sweetness and tart to their bland tasting protein. There is still much more room for improvement, however. 

For some immediate reprieve of your taste buds, you can try adding one of their 3 house made salsas to your tacos for free! You can sample these after ordering as well, since they usually have some nachos near the cash for this purpose. 

All in all, a great place to pick up some filling tacos while on a budget (most of their tacos go for $4). But definitely not the best tacos you can find in this city."}
