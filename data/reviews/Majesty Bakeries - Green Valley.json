{"text":"This review is for GimmeSomeSugarlv before they changed it or joined with their new company. My mother and my sister wanted to get a custom made cake for my high school graduation party and they saw the work done by gimmesomesugarlv and decided to get the cake done by them. They designed the cake and how big they wanted it. The day of my graduation they pick up the cake and it looked awesome and we were excited to try it. The time came yo slice the cake and my mother found it rather hard and just dry. They spent over $300 on my cake to get a shittier and dryer cake than a way much more cheaper cake else where. The cake is usually the best part of any party and in this case it was just a major let down. They payed an arm and a leg for this shitty cake."}
{"text":"Thank you for contacting me and addressing my problem. I certainly understand family emergencies happen. I look forward to your generous offer and am looking forward to a trip back very soon."}
{"text":"I went here for a groupon I purchased & they told me new ownership even though it's the same menu as before so groupon is no good. So I ordered a chicken gyro that barely had any meat on it & some stale/chewy chips. They offered me a complimentary brownie which was very dry. I spit out the 1st bite & didn't eat it. They had complimentary water which was room temp. I highly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This bakery was lovely! The inside was so pretty! My husband and I ate her for breakfast, he had the classic and I had the sunrise bun (bagel with bacon). Both of our meals were delicious! My husband said he wasn't still hungry but he wished he had more it was so good! My bagel sandwich was super yummy also, totally filling! Will totally be going back to try more things!    Oh and the staff was so friendly, brought our drinks and food to our table for us and even took my tea bag out of my tea for me when I was done, I can't recall the name of my tea but it was fruity and delicious.:)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday based on reviews and it was on the way home. The d√©cor is beautiful - reminiscent of Persian style. The baked goodies look scrumptious and delectable. However, I just stopped to pick up lunch.   I ordered Pancho's Tacos and a gyro - a little better than \"meh!\". Also noticed there weren't any other customers except me. Not a good sign. The food prices were a little on the steep side especially for \"meh\" quality. I guess they're trying to make up for the slow business with the higher prices. It looks bleak to me."}
{"text":"Found this place while surfing Yelp and what a great find. They opened a week or so ago and their website looked so enticing we immediately got in the car to try this new treasure out. First the young man and woman working behind the counter were so friendly and nice we felt very welcomed. We ordered coffee and a breakfast bagel sandwich and sat down at their VERY pretty and elegant decor. The coffee was excellent and the breakfast sandwich served with fresh fruit was excellent too. I love that they serve hot coffee in a large glass mug. Hot drinks taste so much better in glass! All the cakes, breads and other desserts in the display case looked so delicious and we will be back shortly to try them as well as the rest of their breakfast and lunch menu. Don't pass this one up. What a great gem for the Henderson community!!"}
{"text":"I love popping into this fusian cafe. Everyone is very happy and welcoming. Panchos tacos are were awsome.."}
{"text":"I love this cafe/bakery/pastry shop with the Aloha spirit!! Their cakes, cake pops, brownies, cup cakes in the pastry showcase looked so perfectly beautiful. (Darn... I'm watching my sugar intake this month.) I ordered their Hawaiian turkey sandwich. Inside of their freshly made buns, they put generous portion of turkey slices, fresh tomatoes, red paper, crisp lettuce and the special spicy mac salad with tuna. OMG, I could eat a container of their mac salad with tuna. It was amazing. Next time, I'll tell them to put more spicy sauce in. I love spicy food... The owner Tasi was a super cool guy. He gave me this huge bag of fresh Hawaiian rolls as a gift. Gasp!! How nice!! He said he's planning to open another store in Southern Highlands neighborhood. (Yay, my neighborhood!!) I'm so excited because that shopping center (Smith's and Ace) needs a store like this. Can't wait for my birthday to try one of their sweet sugary pastries. I bet it would be like Heaven.  Mahalo, Tasi!! I'll be back for sure ;-)"}
{"text":"when here specifically for the sourdough bread and it was a grand slam.  been back again for more. log in on yelp and you receive a free loaf of bread, usually 3.99. loving this bakery now than San Francisco sourdough has closed down."}
{"text":"This review is for (formerly) Gimme Some Sugar which combined forces with Majesty Bakery. My daughter and I stopped in one day intending to buy a few cupcakes and macarons to test before ordering several dozen for a party. Boy were we glad we did! The cupcakes were definitely old, hard as a rock and dry as a bone. As a seasoned baker myself, I know when a cupcake has been baked fresh. For crying out loud woman how many days had it been since you baked? She did say usually she will do a tasting when someone wants to order a lot, however I wanted to see what kind of business person this was by sampling what was in her case on a daily basis. Needless to say after a couple of bites of what we bought, it all went into the trash!Exactly where it belonged. $32 bucks down the drain. Even the macarons were not fresh or tasty. Please do yourself a favor and save your money. Even the grocery stores cupcakes taste better than these!"}
{"text":"OMG the staff are so amazing and sweet. It was so much fun ordering cakes here before arriving to Vegas.  So not disappointed this was a great choice  Lovely selection and variety of sweets for all.  Will def go back and I know my friends that live there will be visiting again"}
