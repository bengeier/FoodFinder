{"text":"The ??? was not very good. The slices of pork were too thin and the whole dish had too much oil. The ???? was good. The ???? was the best dish. Tasted exactly how I would get it in China. All the dishes we had weren't very spicy so pick them if you want a milder dish."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here through Foodora: Shanghai Noodles and Veggie Fried Rice. It. was. awful.

The minute I got handed my bag of food, all I could smell was the stench of overcooked eggs. I hoped the other flavours would balance the egg flavour out once I started eating, but there was barely any other flavour. The noodles were truly awful. I tried to eat it since i paid for it but gave up and threw it in the bin. The eggs tasted as bad as they smelled. There was no attempt at any real sauce and it just tasted like it was drowning in cooking oil.

 I hoped the fried rice would be better. Unfortunately, I could tell just from looking that it wasn't going to be. They didn't even mix it properly in frying it up, so there were big clumps of white rice in the middle of the other clumps. And I don't know how they screwed up cooking rice, but they really did. It tasted like badly cooked basmati even though I don't think that's the kind of rice they used. Briefly considered freezing the rice and recooking it with my own sauce later but ultimately decided I would rather chuck my 30$ down the drain then have to live through trying to eat that food again.

I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in food I've ordered in. Never again."}
{"text":"While demographics change, and gentrification continues to reshape Toronto's neighbourhoods, Chinatown does not remain unaffected by this reality.  With what seems to be more Chinese restaurants closing shop, rather than opening up to curious diners, there remain some hidden gems to be discovered, in an area which is becoming increasingly more trendy, and most likely, much less Chinese. 

Sichuan House, as the nomenclature would imply, specializes in Sichuan food - hot, spicy and numbing dishes - most of which feature chilli oil, hot dry chilis and Sichuan peppercorns quite heavily. The flavours are authentic, and while maybe unbeknownst to some, this is not a place you would frequent if you're looking to eat chicken balls, and other westernized dishes. 

Having eaten at Sichuan House many times, I have tried various dishes from the menu, and none has ever disappointed me in flavour. As someone with a penchant for spice, the kitchen has always been happy to modify any dish by expanding on the spice, and as what seems to be a pretty friendly establishment, it would be fair to presume that accommodations to those with an aversion to spicy foods would be unproblematic. 

Do check out Sichuan house if you love spicy, authentic Sichuan cuisine!"}
{"text":"Ordered with ubereats. Awsome delivery and very cool the ability to track your delivery. The food, on the other hand is a different story. What can i say \"GOD FUKG AWFUL\". Nothing redeeming about any of their dishes. My lord, they couldnt even mix cucumber in chili sauce and get it right, forget about the duck, shredded pork and hot and sour water....i mean soup. Avoid at all costs. Thankfully, ubereats refunded the entire order and added $10 to give the service another try, which i will do."}
{"text":"this restaurant opened and closed for the past few years and it had different owners, and the food was once good and bad. 
From this year, It has been performed quite nicely and steady, so i have decided to give it a review. 

for Chinese people, they have the Chinese menu online.

{"text":"i went there today, the service wasnt really that good, theres like only one waitress there serving, cuz of that the service was really slow; when i wanted the bill i had to go up  to the cashier to ask for it because they werent even paying attention to the customers..
the price is a fine not cheap but not legit expensive..i ordered  2 dishes and the total was $28, tbh i dont think its worth it. 
the food isnt bad but the fried pork feet was a bit dry..but the lamb was pretty good, but has a lot of oil too"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Si Chuan so can't comment on the venue itself. As far as the food, we got the beef jerk appetizer, the cumin lamb and the special schezwan noodles. The beef jerky was very flavorful but a little hard, the cumin lamb was lacking the cumin taste and the noodles were quite good. While the food dint wow us, we would definitely order again when we're craving Chinese!"}
{"text":"A Chinatown mainstay. What is this restaurant not doing on yelp? *added

Hidden away (not really) on Spadina is easily one of the best Sichuan restaurants in Toronto south of the suburbs. Relatively cheap and very authentic

Sichuan Beer Duck- excellent!
Jellyfish- great, in a tangy sauce
Deep Fried Peanuts- cheap snack
Chongqing Style Boiled Meat and Blood Curd- good that they have regional items like this but it was nothing special to me and it was kind of \"offal\" (ha!)
Special Sichuan House Noodles- (don't remember it too well)
Seaweed- fine
Homestyle Lamb- decent
Special Sesame Pancake with Beef- very good
Pork Ear Salad- fine

Kudos to this restaurant for having an authentic menu and some of the best service."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from there and it was pretty bad. It took about 1:15h for the delivery to get to my place and most dishes were no longer hot.

The mapodoufu was just edible. The fried noodles were quite terrible making me wonder why they even had them on the menu. The fried cabbage was basically huge pieces of uncooked, lukewarm cabbage in a bit of oil with a couple of \"ma jiao\" and a few red peppers. We also ordered a very simple dish that i had eaten a number of time in Sichuan: tomatoes with fried eggs. The tomatoes were sandy and not ripe. The eggs were edible though. All in all, most of the food went straight top the garbage.

I added one star here because the lady who took my order was really friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious  authentic food. Healthy and  fresh . Very flavorful and excellent  value.  Great service."}
{"text":"Very good value. The lunch special Monday through Friday is $5.50 and includes a seaweed appetizer, corn/ egg soup and 1/10 entrees. We got the beef noodle soup and the pork/ rice. They were both on the spicy side but tasted good and the meat portions/ ingredients were very generous for the price. Nothing fancy but good food, friendly service and one of the best values in town."}
{"text":"I tried their Lunch Special item, I believe it was the Kopow (or something) Chicken and the total came out to $6.25 after taxes. It was a take out and I expected poor quality food but it was really enjoyable. It was a medium sized take-out container and half of it was just plain rice and the other half was the chicken and veggies. It was actually really good. It comes with some sort of wonton soup with tomato slices but it was pretty meh.

The food itself was really nice for the price point and it was very filling. I had asked for actual sichuan spice (peppercorn) for the true experience but I guess there was some miscommunication there? I never had the sichuan spice but even without it the food was really good.

 I have only tried one item here but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"One of a couple Sichuan themed restaurants in chinatown.

They offer a good variety of dishes, with spicy and not-so-spicy options for those that aren't good with heat, though some may ask why you're in a sichuan restaurant in the first place.

It doesn't look like they've renovated the interior for awhile (compared to the place across the street for example), but you should be here for the food, not the sights.

Their washrooms are good for one person only, not located in the basement, and there's this hallway with a sink and mirror. I guess if you only need to wipe the chili oil off your mouth that's what it's for.

They have a party room that you can book, but I don't know the details for that. Might be useful to know.

Flavors are good; the ones that are listed as one-chili aren't too spicy.

I really enjoyed their noodle bowls. For $6 to $8, you get a decent-sized bowl that you can split between two or three people. Dishes are designed for sharing, and you probably should do so to try as many things as you can."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is warm and friendly! I LOVE their fish in hot oil. A warning though, this place is not for the faint of heart!"}
{"text":"Ordered from UBER EATS. So. Bad. Will be complaining to Uber in the morning. Avoid this spot!!!! Gristly chicken and bland beef. The spring rolls tasted freezer burnt. Beware!"}
{"text":"not the greatest looking restaurant on the outside but the food is really great! i ordered the spicy soup bowl with 8 choices and the portion was huge. it was super cheap, under 10$ and tasted so great. my friends loved their orders too. waiter came frequently to refill water. will definitely come back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"They have variety of Chinese dish, but I found the food to be very salty than spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Don't ask me why, but I found myself with a craving for that very specific Sichuan spice. You know, the one where your tongue gets a little numbed with each bite. So I was wandering up Spadina and noticed an eatery with the promise of that very spice right in its name. Easy decision.

I walked in and was immediately handed several menus, including one for the joint's lunch specials. When the waiter returned, I asked him what the hottest item on the menu was (which, in retrospect, should also have included a request for the Sichuan spicing). He pointed out a few options, including the Kong Bao Chicken with Peanuts. Done.

First I received a couple of appetizers: a weird, watery soup with chunks of tomatoes and a spicy seaweed salad. They were both fine, though completely unmemorable.

The main course arrived shortly after and it's good. There's a lot of food here, and the dish certainly doesn't skimp on the chicken. It's actually mostly chicken, onions, and hot peppers. (There were also literally two chunks of green pepper, which was weird.) The sauce is tasty and it all went well with the accompanying bowl of rice. Was it as spicy as I wanted? Not even close. I feel like the waiter saw a white-ish guy and offered something with a minimal amount of spice.

I would probably return, if only to see if they do, in fact, have any Suchuan-based dishes."}
{"text":"Though I only had a meeting here last month, I can verify that it's authentic yet slightly modern-decorated, which is a very good thing in this part of Chinatown in TO.  meaning that compared to the other older-looking establishments that probably need any type of renos, Si chuan is clean and i'll try it next time i'm in town.

but judging from the food served, can vouch for generous servings & smelled good.  Even the locals will go there, know what i mean? ;)

And the washrooms are good & clean too, b/c they don't have the typical mop in there lol."}
{"text":"Spicy and yum! Good old school Chinatown feel. Kid friendly. Don't wear white you'll get chilli oil all over yourself, but is that a bad thing?"}
{"text":"We visit Sichuan House regularly. The food is really authentic and of great quality. Service is fast and the place is clean. What else would one want in Spadina. The food can be fiery though and the sichuan pepper can be quite flavourful. Not for the faint hearted.
Do try the chicken with chilli,  fish in hot oil, twice cooked pork, cumin fried beef and the egg fried rice....The stir fried watercress is nice too...

bon apetit!"}
{"text":"they have lunch specials like signature beef noodle for only $5.5!!!! Such good price!!! The gal or was okay"}
{"text":"very authentic and not really expensive

chili fish and mapo toufu is exactly the same as what we once had in china, can vouch for that.

sichuan house even offer dilivery, we live in spadina and it is a bless to have the chili fish delivered to the door when it is winter.

kudos for the food and being authentic."}
{"text":"Tonight for dinner I was craving something hot and spicy, while there were now hakka places nearby I looked around for something similar and read a couple of reviews on Yelp about Si Chuan House. Located on the west side of Spadina just south of Nassau Street, Si Chuan House is a small non-descript place. Featuring a few tables in the window and few more in front of a small bar in the back, with the kitchen behind it doesn't look any different from any of the other Chinese places on Spadina. Indeed, we had walked by it more times than I can remember without really every noticing it. 

They have an extensive menu featuring lots of familiar sichuan dishes and a few unique ones I had never seen before. Reviewing their menu, my friend decided on their cumin beef, which was a simple plate of fried beef with cumin and a few red peppers piled high. While I ordered their Kung Pao shrimp. We also had two dishes of steamed rice and an order of their crispy chive pancakes. I always measure Kung Pao against the dishes I had in China. In China they were really simple, shrimp and peanuts cooked dry then glazed with a heaping pile of red peppers becoming one of my favourite dishes. Too often in Canada the dish is missing the sheer amount of peppers and is filled instead with lots of vegetables. Si Chuan's version featured shrimp and peanuts, that were cooked in the red pepper sauce, missing some of the flavour they acquire when cooked dry, but I was pleased to find a place that actually served one of my favourite dishes. We will be back to try more on their menu."}
