{"text":"A place for real Japanese taste and I call it the best in GTA. A restaurant that you can fully trust and simply allow you to pick anything from their menu - from miso soup, salad, appetitizers, to sushi, hand rolls, steaks,  shabu shabu (amazing sukiyaki soup) and even dessert or green tea!  Extremely friendly service and don't be shy to ask for advice. Their sushi is like art with fresh fish, sushi rice, premium wasabi, pickled ginger and soya sauce. The fish is cut with skill and the sushi rice is well covered.   Of course, it's hard to compare to Hong Kong and Japan about the variety of Seafood/Fish but this is acceptable as we know Toronto is such an inland city.   If you have no clue of the night, just pick Miyabi Course, a combo for two person with excellent appretizers, salad, miso soup, sushi, sashimi, shabu shabu* (beef & vegetable hot pot) and dessert. Great value and portion I would say.    The speed of sushi some people might think a bit slow but that's how the chef keeps his quality. I recommend you to take a look at the chef while he is working at the sushi bar, you will find a serious man making sushi precisely and skillfully - hopefully that will extend your patient a bit. Absolutely not a place for fast service."}
{"text":"We hear Myabi has great sushi and sashimi. However we will never know.   First I should clarify that this review is mostly based on the service, or more accurately, the lack of service. Last night at my mother's request, we drove 30 minutes past many other Japanese restaurants to eat there, since it had good reviews. Once we got to the shopping complex, we saw Wasabi restaurant but not Myabi. She called the restaurant, and we finally found the restaurant towards the back right, hidden behind a tree at about 7:15 pm. The place was busy so we were seated in their only private room (our kids liked this). It took us about 20 minutes to get our drinks then order three udon bowls, stir fried udon, and a $65 sushi/sashimi boat which had about 25 pieces. After 20 minutes we got the noodle dishes and ate that. At about 8pm, because they closed at 9pm, we opened the door to our private room as we were eating the noodles to make sure they didn't forget about us. At about 8:15, we finished the noodle dishes and walked out to find a waitress. They said they were backed up (another party that came after us must have ordered before us and we saw they had two sushi/sashimi boats on their table). We were told the sushi chef was making ours ( there was no chef standing at the sushi making station), and it would take 15 minutes. At about 8:30 we were told it would still take about 15 minute to make out boat and did we still want to have the sushi-sashimi boat. It looked like the chef was starting to make our boat. By this time there was only about two other tables with guests since the restaurant closed at 9pm. At that time we told them to cancel the order. During this whole time there was no explanation why we got such poor service. We think they forgot the dish and was unwilling to admit it or do anything to help make up for it. We were still charged full price for what we got. After we left, we went to the nearby Northern Dumpling Kitchen and got 5 excellent dishes within 15 minutes of walking through the door for about $20.  Oh, the udon noodles were good, but not amazingly great compared to other places we've been to."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant that is run by Japanese people.  They are currently having a winter special, where all highlighted items in the same section is buy one dish get the second half price ! super good deal !  Food-3.5/5 ( liste of food I ate )  Spicy Salmon Hand Roll-It wasn't spicy, instead it had regular japanese mayo was abit disappointed because i was expecting a nice spicy flavor  Hamachi Hand Roll - Nothing special  ** I have to say that the nori was crispy and fresh though** ++  Futo Maki Roll- ( total of 4 pcs ) it tastes very traditional Spider Roll- ( total of 6pcs) very different from your regular spider rolls where you would get at any other japanese restaurants, they literally just had the fried soft crab with tiny bits of green onion in a size of an california roll...the crab was a bit to dry for me..and for some odd reason the rice was sticking to my teeth..mm..not as good  Deluxe Sushi -Came with Uni, Eel, Salmon, Tuna, Scallop, Shrimp, salmon roe, clam, white tuna 3 pcs salmon roll and 3 pcs cucumber roll  -Nothing special or wow..the size of the rice is great though and the fish is fresh and at the perfect temperature  Deluxe Sashimi-5pcs salmon, 3 pcs mackeral, 4 small pcs of ikura, 2 Hamachi, 3 Tuna, 2 Octapus  - Same as the Deluxe sushi, nothing very wow about the sashimi  Customer Service 5/5 the 2 ladies there were very nice, always checking up on our table and filling up our tea  The wait for our food was a bit long though..kinda felt like they have forgetten our order.  Overall to me it's an average Japanese restaurant and I would come back and recommend others to try"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi and Japanese food. The service and quality of food are always consistent, and impressive. My wife loves their chawanmushi and my kids like the oyaku don. The staff always seems genuinely happy to see us. The price is a bit on the high side, but they have special going on that will give you half price for the second order of the same sushi. My one complaint is the background music, which amazingly, has never been changed during the years that I've been there"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Miyabi for lunch with my co-worker quite a few times in the last few months and have never been disappointed.    We either have the sashimi lunch or the sushi B lunch and it's been consistently good every time. The Californian rolls are good. And I never say that for any I've ever had.  Quality of fish, rice, presentation are always good and that's a true mark for any restaurant and especially more so for a Japanese restaurant serving fresh fish.   Plus if you come to lunch during the weekdays, there are discounts so makes everything that much better.  Highly recommended and always look forward to lunch whenever my co-worker feels like sushi."}
{"text":"Cost: on the high side Quality: good - 85% Decor: fair - 65% typical \"no decor\" authentic Jap restaurant I think Staff: average service - 70% (don't go there if service is important to you) Value: good - 75%  Keeper? Yes we go there for the best Chirashi in Markham."}
{"text":"If you are in a rush then I would recommend visiting another restaurant. The service at this restaurant is a hit or miss. I had visited this restaurant twice for dinner. On my first visit, my friends and I were the first customers in the restaurant and the service at that time for me was a little slow.  The second time I visit (tonight actually) was a complete failure. I felt as though our presence was not acknowledge as much as other patrons that were in the restaurant. I did see a difference in service in between tables. My party of 3 had ordered 3 sets of maki, sashimi moriawase, and sushi deluxe. After 40 minutes of waiting, I realize the party that arrived 10 minutes after us had received food before we did and was receiving warmer treatment from the waitress.   Already annoyed, I had to ask the waitress when my friends and I were going to expect our food. The first answer she gave was that our order was behind 2 other orders but then after seeing the annoyed look on my face, she walked quickly to the sushi chef and then came back to my table to tell me they'll have it right away. Although she apologized, she did not seem sympathetic. Instead of offering us a snack while we wait for our food, she just asked us if we want to order a hot item from the kitchen instead. If this were to happen in any other restaurant, they would have either tried to avoid this situation or have already acknowledge for the wait and offered something for the time being.  After another 5 minutes of waiting, we received our 2 sets of maki that was half-heartedly put together. The waitress didn't even realize we had no napkins or utensils at the table and I had to ask her for them.  Based on the quality of service, I will not return again to this restaurant again.  My only positive comment for this restaurant is the quality of fish."}
{"text":"Visit this hidden Japanese restaurant after hearing great things about it.  And what perfect timing as I was wondering where to take my mom for Mother's Day.  I was recommended to order the tempura shrimp and the ramen.  Got the tempura shrimp and tempura soft shell crab but the ramen was sold out.  Kinda disappointed but what can you do.  So we ordered the udon instead and it was good; the udon was soft and chewy.  We also ordered a sushi and sashimi boat combo.  I really have no complain about the food.  Everything was well prepared and fresh.  Time for things I didn't like.  The service was really really slow.  The host, waitress, and bus are the same person.  Our tea was still filled whenever it was low but the food seem took forever to arrive.  It was worst than waiting for food in a ayce sushi restaurant.  My friend had warned me about the pricey menu and he wasn't lying.  $13-16 for a bowl of udon, $12 for shrimp tempura, $14 for soft crab tempura, and $70 for sushi & sashimi combo.    If you have a big appetite for sushi but carrying very little in your pocket, I would not recommend this place.  But this sushi shop is probably the best and most authentic sushi restaurant there is around the busy intersection of hwy 7 and Leslie so if you are looking for good quality sushi, your best bet is here.  Just be patient.  I was going to give this place a 3 star, but the quality really made up for the 4th star.    Cheers."}
{"text":"I would say this is my favorite Japanese restaurant around this area- Markham, Richmond Hill.  I particularly like their sushi but they are not big so I eat more pieces than other places.  I love their live shrimp sushi and the shrimp head can deep fried.  They are very delicious; however they are not always available depends on the season.  Sometimes they offer special sushi they will post them on the wall.     They also have some grill fish dishes I like them too.  Nabeyakiudon is good too especially eat it in the winter time.  (Udon in a hot pot)  Try not to go there in the Saturday and Sunday evening- lots people.  Sometimes it took 1 hour to get the food especially sushi."}
{"text":"The most authentic Japanese restaurant in Markham/Richmond Hill area. Daily lunch special is very good."}
{"text":"Good Quality sushi is hard to find.  But I guarantee you will find it here.  The service is so good that I actually made friends with the employees and I know the waitresses by their first names.  Their green tea is delicious, and they never leave you with an empty cup.    Great menu selection of truly authentic Japanese foods. They make their own Soy Sauce in-house!!! That little detail right there tells you how amazing their food is.  I've tasted almost everything on their menu and nothing - NOTHING - has disappointed me so far.  Even foods like donkatsu, I don't know if it's the oil or the bread crumbs, but it had the best texture I've tasted.  Their hand rolls are the BEST.  I love that the seaweed they use is actually roasted, seasoned seaweed so you get a nice crunch when you bite into a handroll, and you don't struggle with it after biting into it to keep the rest of the seaweed from unravelling because it's still attached to the rest of the roll.  The rice texture is perfect and cuts of fish are the right proportions and the freshest you'll ever find.  I find it very difficult to eat in any other sushi resto because they've raised my standards so high."}
{"text":"\"The one with the tasty but slow Futomaki.\"  Good: Exceptional quality; very fresh and authentic   Bad: Takes forever for the food to come (on a weekday lunch too!); might be a little pricey; portions might seem small  Overview: Undoubtedly the best quality sushi I have eaten in the Richmond Hill location. Albeit a little pricey (a 10 piece sushi box set with sashimi and rolls cost $15 before tax), the quality and cut of the fish was truly authentic and the rice texture was just right. I've never been a fan of Futomaki before but that was definitely the best piece I had out of the lunch box, which included fresh salmon, white tuna, mackerel, unagi and a few more. It did, however, take 1+ hours to prepare the meal for us, and this was on a weekday at 12PM. They later did mention that the head chef was away and they were short on people but my friend who I later recommended to go to this place said the same thing happened, although there were two chefs at that time.  The place itself is not that large, with only one table available for large seating. This room is located in the front of the restaurant and it is a traditional \"shoes-off, sit down on the floor\" style table. Other tables hold 4 people or so at most.   Overall, a very nice place with the best quality sushi I've had. The wait was somewhat long and it was a little pricier, but you get what you pay for! (If you're looking for alternatives around this area, try Inaho on East Beaver Creek)."}
{"text":"This is a truly authentic japanese reataurant which is difficult to find. Japanese owned and run. The fish is fresh and the tempura tasted just like japan. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Very good quality curry with lots of bee flavour.  A little expensive though, but I guess is worth it, I'm coming back.  Japanese ppl operated!  :D"}
{"text":"This place has the most crispy and best spicy salmon or spicy tuna hand roll. Their spicy sauce is one of a kind, pure Japanese taste with really good quality sashimi"}
{"text":"I am not sure if the food tastes good because we had to wait forever for the food to come.  So by the time the food finally arrive (an hour later) we were totally famished.  You would think shabu shabu should be quite quick as you are doing your own table top cooking.  Well, you'll be in for a huge shock.  After an hour wait, the table top grill finally arrived.  20 mins later, the raw platter of meat and veggies show up.  Another 10mins passed... no pot to cook the food with.  The meat pretty much defrost itself waiting to be cook.  At that point I begin to wonder... am I supposed to eat the stuff raw!?  I know going to authentic Japanese place will take some time to eat as they focus on senses.  I totally ain't feeling anything but hunger after this experience.  Absolutely not worth it for the price you pay and for the lousy service."}
{"text":"Cute little authentic Japanese restaurant tucked in the corner of Jubliee Square. Very sweet staff. Food portions aren't the biggest but definitely fresh! My all-time favourite dish from here is their Kaki-fry (deep fried oysters). You can get it for lunch in a bento box, which comes with salad, miso soup and a bowl of rice or if you prefer 6 california rolls, you can get that instead of the bowl of rice. The food is always very fresh, the kaki fry is made when you order so it's hot, and the sauce you get to dip it in tastes very good as well.  Another thing about Miyabi is their salad dressing. I think they make it themselves because I've never had it anywhere else. It is amazing. Light, yet still flavourful.  Parking just may be hard to find if you go during peak lunch hours.  They also have 2 small rooms where you can sit on the floor."}
{"text":"We ordered the Toro combo (2 toro sushi, 4 toro sashimi, and 2 toro hand rolls) for 36.50. The fish was amazing! It was pricey, but for that many pieces, it was a pretty good deal. I would say this is THE set to share for two people (unless you wanna have it all to yourself, which I totally understand :) ). But I'd have to say that the toro may have been somewhere between chutoro (medium toro) and the ultra fatty otoro.  I also ordered the sushi main course for 30 bucks. I asked the lady how many pieces there would be, and she said 11 pieces sushi and 6 rolls, but only 9 pieces and 6 rolls came. Slight disappointment, but the quality of the fish were great nonetheless.  I would give this maybe 4.5 if I could. 9.0/10 for quality, 8.5/10 for the value, 8.5/10 for the service. 9/10 overall"}
{"text":"A small little sushi place that I would have never visited if not for my lovely friend. We had salmon belly, grilled yellowtail which was decent. Love the black cod! Beef tataki was the reason I didn't give it a 5 star, do not recommend. Had the sashimi morisaewa, it was SUPER FRESH! Toro maki and uni sushi was good. The salmon skin handroll and the uni hand is a MUST TRY!! Unlike other handroll, the uni in it was from top to bottom, there will not be a bite with just rice!"}
{"text":"Their steamed egg for appetizer is my fav! A must get for sure, the slightly salty and super smooth texture of the egg is heaven.  As for the main I really enjoy the chirashi.  I'm big on japanese sushi rice, the perfect balance of vinegar and sweetness of the rice.mmm."}
{"text":"One of my favorourite go-to places for japanese in the burbs. It's a mom and pop shop so it's not flashy and it's not a place to hang out at and it's a bit pricey.  But you coming here for legitimacy.   Integrity is important and that is evidenced in their food.  Shrimp tempura at $4 (around there) a piece might sound like a lot, but when each one gives you mouthfuls of succulent meat on a crunchy batter you won't be let down.  The fish quality is always notches above anything except for establishments that might run you double the price."}
{"text":"Miyabi is one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants uptown.  This place is a bit small, but they are opened by Japanese and they serve very fresh and tasty Sashimi!!    The pricing for this restaurant is actually on the high side, but my theory is, if the food is worth the money i'm paying for, I am happy.  You can never expect to pay 1 star price for 5 stars quality food.  I highly recommend their Hamachi sushi/Sashimi.  The fish was not only beautiful, but it was also very fresh and tasty!  Their sushi and rolls are pretty decent too, and  I ordered some of their side dishes such as the Takoyaki and they were all well made.  If you are looking for some authentic Japanese restaurants uptown and don't want to waste money on AYCE, I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Just a word of advice: if you're looking for a good deal on sushi (ie/ quantity and decent food) then this is not the place for you.   This quaint authentic Japanese restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a relatively dead plaza. They have a cute atmosphere going, but not really meant for HUGE parties as the restaurant isn't particularly big. Service is friendly and pretty attentive, no complaints there!   Food wise, Miyabi has authentic dishes (as well as fusion rolls that are popular in North America) and most importantly, their fish is fresh! Sure, you can get cheap sashimi elsewhere, but if you're looking for quality of fish in the area, this is a pretty good place to start.   I've had their Nabeyaki udon as well, and it has always stuck with me! Very tasty and filling for a good price ($13.95)! If you've ever been to other Japanese restaurants, you'll know that they traditionally don't load up their dishes, as the focus is more on flavour, but their udon are well-portioned.   As others have mentioned, menu items can be pricey, so take that into consideration! I personally find it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Been back to Toronto from Japan for almost 2 weeks now and appetite for japanese food is calling!craving some fresh sashimi and Miyabi never disappoints! This japanese restaurant is tucked in a corner inside Jubilee Square (hwy7/west beaver creek), hidden next to Golden Court Chinese Restaurant (pretty big one, can't miss it). Miyabi has always been one of my favourite go-to Japanese restaurants in Richmond Hill area, they have fresh fish, slightly pricey but it's worth it! Never risk eating cheap Japanese food especially when you're eating raw. I'm not a bif fan of AYCE jap food or buffets, I'm more keen on trying \"a la carte\" menus and Miyabi has a great variety which I like. Their Chirashi is amazing, curry chicken/pork cutlet rice, tempura are also very well done! This place has been here for years & years and I think I will start/continue coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service... And that's about it. Why 2 stars? Read on and you'll see.  On the first time I went there, they were really good. Now I go there a little more often, they have became downhill. Food tastes bad (Something tells me they are trying to say \"GET OUT\" on me.) Also it was pretty pricy even for a tiny appetizer.  I ate a tiny sashimi appetizer. It was $13 and is really tiny. Steak. It was like.... Small.  ====Pros and Cons==== Pros: -Friendly service  Cons: -Less menu choices (Even less for lunch! Lunch menu is ONLY 2 pages!) -Pricy (Like what I said above, tiny appetizer for $13.) -20 minutes to cook a meal. (WOW!! That's getting way too far vs. other restaurants out there.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chirashi , something I don't usually get because I don't like eating so much rice,  but this rice was delicious! Perfect balance of the wet/sticky Japanese rice with bits of seaweed, egg and ginger. Topped off with a variety of fresh sashimi including salmon, Hamachi, mackerel, sweet shrimp, octopus, surf clam. The salmon was a bit soft/mushy for my personal taste but otherwise everything was good.   Also ordered a side of soft shell crab - crispy and freshly deep fried; not all pieces were very meaty but liked the batter.   Fresh oysters - malpeque. Didn't like the green onion on top though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the same colleagues who had raved about their dinner here the night before.  Driving on the highway, it may be hard to notice the restaurant in the plaza. The menu offers a lot of variety and choices to choose from. There are also a number of specials listed on the wall. I would highly recommend calling or finding out what the special bento is for lunch, as it's 20% off, but the item changes everyday and month.   I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box which came with three pieces California rolls, miso soup, salad, a bit of seaweed salad, rice, and salmon teriyaki. The salmon was cooked nicely, and the price was reasonable for the lunch bento. Everything on it was fresh.   I tried some of my colleagues katsudon, and it was really good, but just mildly salty for me. Although I can't speak for dinner, my colleagues mentioned that the sushi was very fresh and delicious. Between the 4 of them, it was $50/person with leftovers to spare."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy, and very amazing how a tiny shop like this has been standing so long.  Which is sad because they've absolutely ruined a few things for me.  The sashimi wasn't bad.   It's relatively ok, but for the price, it might have been a bit much.  These prices were comparable to Ichiban.  Also ordered was a udon with shrimp tempura, chicken and mushrooms.  I'm not sure how other people may have liked their udon, but I personally thought that it's best to serve the shrimp tempura separate from the udon, and not place it inside, with the lid on.  Sure, the shrimp wasn't disgusting to eat, but it was clearly soggy from having absorbed all the humidity of the soup.  Taste wasn't anything so spectacular that it'd blow your mind, but it was decent.  It wasn't an MSG filled concoction, but, considering it cost almost $15 and I wasn't full from that AND the sashimi platter I shared with my buddy, I can't say I was impressed.  A bill that cost nearly $60, and two still slightly hungry guys later, I can't help but wonder how these guys stayed around for so long.  The service was alright, the atmosphere was ok, but it just wasn't a good bang your buck.    So, would I go back?  I'm tempted to say no.  I'm in no rush to get back because let's face it, there are few Japanese restaurants that don't force you into the whole \"All You Can Eat\" fiasco, and I'm fine with that.  I don't mind being served a fixed portion of food.  However, given the few choices, the high price tag, the mediocre taste, and the sadly small portion, I can't help but think, it can be much better.  Which is why, the score too, can be much better."}
{"text":"My mother wanted to check out Miyabi so we trekked it up here on a sunny Sunday afternoon. In a strip mall, there's a lot of free parking on site along with Chinese bakeries, restaurants, and shops. Inside, it looks like an old school Japanese izakaya with Enka playing in the background. I was impressed with the menu; they have a lot of specials. The sushi menu is extensive and the fish used look very fresh. I wasn't in the mood for sushi so I ended up ordering the Tendon. A generous portion of tempura with a bowl of rice was great. Service was very friendly and attentive. As I insinuated earlier in this review, Miyabi is nowhere close to my home so I don't think I'll return if I'm not in the area. Also, I noticed that other reviews mentioned the price point here; I didn't find menu items to be significantly expensive.  Good for: lunch, dinner, Japanese"}
{"text":"Most people think pricey but you're absolutely getting quality. These guys are legit, serving authentic Japanese style dishes and sushi. Fresh wasabi and sashimi. Service is always top notch. Cozy restaurant and so worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner because of the great reviews. I had a table of 12 people plus a baby. They seated us all together which is great. We had ordered a few sushi's and a platter before people got to the restaurant and although the sashimi was fresh, it took them 1 hour to provide us with food.  They work on a very slow time line. 1 sushi chef, 4 in the kitchen, 2 waitresses and barely any English. They are slightly behind the times - they calculate your bill manually, add things to your bill manually so it does take them a while to get it.  The family ordered oyaku don and Katsu don - these came out fairly quickly.  The sukiyaki was large; they gave us a plate of raw food, a pot and a kettle of soy sauce. It took them almost two hours to put this on our table.   The hot foods are overly salted. The course meals that you can get came out slow with 45 minutes between each course. With its price, not worth it.  The restaurant wasn't full either. If it was an omekase, then I get it, why it takes so long. But it wasn't. The food was good, but I'd really look at how long you want to spend at a restaurant to eat. Was it worth the price? Some items were pretty good. Was it worth wasting my 3.5 hours there for a meal with an exhausted baby wanted food but not getting it? No thank you.  Poor grandmas. They were all very very cranky too..."}
{"text":"Let me make it easy. We were here this week. Pro: in a Chinese strip, but chef and staff are Japanese  variety of stuff on menu both sushi and cooked food tasty Japanese omelettes and sushi variety of sake available private Japanese booths -  request to sit in those for the true Japanese dining feeling  Con: expensive small pieces for sushi (see: price) Slow service - understaffed sketchy washroom - rundown lobsters choking and walking on each other in the tank. Saddest thing to see when they are tied and cannot open their claws and have to stand on each other too huge parking lot but no available space"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! I had FOOD POISONING after I ate here. I ate nigiri and later fell sick to FOOD POISONING!   FOOD POISONING! if you don't know what that is, it's continuous DIARRHEA.  I had to visit my family doctor.   AVOID this place!"}
{"text":"A place to social not to eat. Only one chef making sushi. Portions are really small. Service is really slow."}
{"text":"Very disappointed . $76 and only such small portions and food tasted terrible . I might as well spend $15 at TNT and would have tasted better .  I am completely upset at getting cheated for this meal . I never post reviews - doing it cause I am frustrated and need to channel my energy out . Worst sushi I have ever had in my life ."}
{"text":"Being Japanese, I am biased about Japanese restaurants, and always prefer to go to a an authentic place that is Japanese owned and operated - Miyabi is one of those restaurants.  If you enjoy AYCE sushi places, don't bother dining here.  The sushi here is made the proper way with vinegar on the rice, with the nori (seaweed) toasted and is high quality, not that chewy stuff you get at the cheaper places.  The salmon skin hand roll and the Futomaki at Miyabi are the best in the city.  Prices reflect the quality, and serving sizes are according to Japanese standards, not North American \"AYCE\" standards.     Those who know the difference between grocery store sushi and the real thing will appreciate Miyabi."}
{"text":"I wish more people would know about this place.  The quality of the food is unbelievably good.  Every time I come I look forward to their sashimi.    They have lots of different Jap variety to choose from.  I really like their pizza, it's not the same as the ones you would find in all you can eat.  It's actually very good quality, I think they mince the meat and mix it with the flour that they use for takayoka (don't know how to spell) and place it in a very hot pan which they serve.  Their service too, I must mention is extremely friendly.  I think they are actually Japanese? Not sure.    If you don't mind spending more than usual (it's about $30 to $40 per person for dinner) I highly recommend you trying this place out."}
{"text":"If you are used to the cheap $6 sushi lunch special in the Richmond Hill area, You will in shock when you see the lunch menu at Miyabi... minimum is $10. One of the full lunch set is $37.50! hmmmm  I was welcome warmly by nice Japanese lady when I entered the restaurant. The deco is traditional Japanese.   For lunch I decided on the Tempura set that comes with salad and soup with California roll ($15.95). yes $15.95... expensive lunch.  The miso soup is a little salty for my taste however, it is loaded with seaweed. Then my tempura box arrived 15 minutes later. There are 2 big tiger shrimps and tons of veggies. I love my veggies tempura much better than the shrimps because they are all moist and juicy. However, the shrimps though big, I found the batter too thick and the shrimps a little dry.  The salad on the side does have a nice seasame dressing but the salad was not fresh and is drown in the dressing.  The California rolls are excellent! But just 3 pieces! I need more! I would trade my shrimp for 3 more pieces of Cali roll!  I will be back again to try out other items on their lunch menu. Maybe their noodles.. I saw a Japanese man order noodles for lunch and he looks like a frequent customer (BTW noodles are $10.95! for a relatively small bowel) Maybe I will order the sushi set instead.  Services is friendly but slow. Since there was only 1 waitress working during lunch time. So don't come if you are in a rush! I was the first to arrive and I still have to wait for my food!  They accepts all major credit cards even the Diner Card!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not worth it to go. It takes 1 1/2 hr to get all your food. We only had two dinner courses. The portion was super small. We still feel hungry after the dinner. They only gave us tiny piece of cooked salmon. I expected at least a regular size of salmon since we paid for $41 per person. When I first looked at the menu, I thought it will be my to-go place. But when I saw the food, everything shattered."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi joints in Markham.....Never a dissapointment. During the cold months like Sept/Oct, make sure you try their Saba sushi (Vinegared mackarel sushi), its awesome!!!!  Great place for kids too. The kids love their Udon."}
{"text":"Solid Japanese food. The menu has a lot of variety -- sushi, sashimi, hot pot, donburi, noodles...plenty of things to choose from. We ordered the salmon sushi, chirashi and tempura appetizer. Fish tasted fresh, chirashi rice was seasoned nicely and the tempura was cooked really well (aka not soggy). Cute little place with friendly service, but it's a little expensive."}
{"text":"Understaffed. Slow service. Come here if you are made of money. But authentic feel. Had pork curry and bf had chicken teriyaki. So underfed but couldn't afford more food that we literally sprinted to McDs at the next plaza over for fries and nuggets."}
