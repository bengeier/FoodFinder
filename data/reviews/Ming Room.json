{"text":"Went on a weekday evening with friends. Restaurant wasn't busy. 
Food was okay. Rates aren't high and the quantities are reasonable. Taste is nothing extraordinary, like any other Hakka Chinese restaurant.  Service needs to improve. Staff wasnt very professional either. You are not missing anything if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. Ordered in for Valentines day - food arrived 2 hours late. Food was very spicy even though we asked for mild and the manager had a lot of attitude when I called to complain. Food was so bad we had to ask for a refund. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I've dinned here and had take-out in the past and the food is usually fantastic, but recently it seems the quality is going downhill. 

Most recently my work ordered lunch from Ming's on my recommendation, and sadly everyone was disappointed. The food was O.K but was not as great as I remembered it in the past. Portions were small and more expensive compared to other restaurants in the general area.

A better choice for Hakka Chinese would be Eddies Wok 'n' Roll located in the same area."}
{"text":"Here is a review I wrote on another site-

I have heard of the Ming Room praised on various blogs, magazines and newspapers. Having high expectations, I found the restaurant to be just average. The food was nothing to be wowed by, I have been just as satisfied if not more at other restaurants across Mississauga and Toronto. The food was also warm not hot and it did not taste fresh imo. A little bit more effort could be put in presentation, I found it sloppy. Also the chili vs. manchurian dishes did not taste different enough to warrant ordering both. The spring rolls were akin to those found at Asian restaurants found at your malls food court. The only things I enjoyed were the rice and noodles, the other dishes were nothing note worthy.

 I found that I enjoyed a place called Savi Kavi in Brampton's Springdale area much more, when I tried it a few years ago on a whim. I wish they had more Hakka chinese restaurants as the food if done right tends to be so flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible, I ordered veg corn soup and veg Hakka noodles and neither came with actual vegetables. Just s few corn in what looked like a soup of corn powder salt and water, and slivers of cabbage with the noodles. Ordered 5 spring rolls as well and came to $26."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit, and I don't really see the allure about the place. Pretty good interior despite what the outside looks like. Funfact, the parking lot had so many pot holes it was like a miniature golf course. 

The food itself was what one would normally expect of a chopsuey place. No garnish, heavy on the sauces, LOTS of flavour. One thing I did notice was the liberal use of jalapeños they used in their spicy dishes.

The service was unremarkable. I don't mean that negatively, they were neither friendly nor rude. It was very silent. A lot of stares and no one really spoke. That's a plus if you're looking for a silent place to chat amongst yourselves. (Just make sure you're not talking about anything private cause the whole restaurant can hear you due to the lack of background music)

Beer and Cocktails are both pretty cheap at $4.50 and $5.50 respectively. 

All in all, I would summarize the restaurant in one word: \"Nonchalant\" 

Also, their fortune cookie called me ugly. :/"}
{"text":"Food is ok. You would getter better hakka at wangs kitchen on hurontario. Trouble is with the owner. He can be more service oriented and talk nicely to customers. Not sure will go back ever after recent experience."}
{"text":"We went here last year when there was the huge power outage. They were pretty much the only place in the whole area that had power (I mean this literally, none of the houses in our area, no restaurants, nothing). I serious would never go there again unless in a similar situation where they were the only place with power in a total blacked out area. Food was yucky all around."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Hakka Chinese restaurants. This place is huge and clean.  Nice decor 
Excellent and fast service
Reasonable pricing as well
I got the zesty fish and manchurian Hakka chicken noodles which were amazing.  The fish was perfectly cooked and spicy.  Even my kids loved it.  I highly recommend this place for a quick lunch and or dinner ."}
{"text":"Missisauga's very own hidden gem. I've gotten my co-workers and clients hooked on this place. The Manchurian  house special chowmein and fried rice are amazing! I'm also addicted to the zesty chicken wings."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here. The staff not so attentive but when the 2 guys are working the staff gives good service. Asian guy and brown guy. This place is super cheap and serves fresh yummy food. It's on the spicer side and I don't like their cut of chicken. I have to ask for a dish with white meat because of the cartilage. This is probably the only Hakka place that will tell you the truth about which dish is only white meat unlike Asian wok on millcreek by the meadowvale Go ."}
{"text":"The food is very spicy. They put chillis in every food. Even for my Indian spice eating self."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good. Hits all the cravings and delivery was very fast with food so hot I burned my mouth. 

I got the house fried rice, manchurian chicken, chicken spring roll (I don't recommend this - lacked flavour and was very oily), the chicken corn soup and the pista kulfi. 

Everything was great except the spring roll. 

Big portions and lots of flavour. 

They are a great choice for delivery."}
{"text":"Probably the best Hakka Chinese Restaurant in town. Have had many kinds of dishes from here and they hit all the right spots.

The ambience is great and very fitting for a family dinner together. Can safely treat others or have a lunch meeting.

The staff and owner are committed and dedicated to ensure that you have a good experience. 

Food is served in good time and always arrives warm. A spice lover will find the Manchurian chicken a pure delight.

Been here many times and will recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go here regularly. The food is always fantastic-our favourites are the Hakka Chowmein, Chilli fish and Manchuria chicken. We hosted our 50ish person engagement party here recently and it was amazing. The food was fresh and well prepared, and the service staff were very nice to all our guests. Ming is also amazing to work with. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were equally as good but nothing really spectacular about this place. We were able to pick two soups one appetizer three entrées and two desserts and this was called the two people can eat for $30 deal. It honestly was not bad it was nice that we got to pick between so many items but nothing was really spectacular. The soup was good and the appetizers were yummy, but the main courses were OK. Kung pow chicken is supposed to be breaded and fried but it was just thin strips of meat in a peanut type sauce. It was super spicy and didn't taste anything like the original. General tso's chicken was good but I felt like the breading was too much and it really made it quite chewy. We got some noodles and they were good but they barely had a taste there was chicken but it was almost tasteless I had to put my other chicken on this noodle to make it tasty.

Overall the meal was not bad and there was plenty of food maybe even enough for three or four people to eat. The dessert was decent but everything about this meal was just OK nothing spectacular. I could go back another time because the prices were so minimal"}
{"text":"After eating at a handful of Hakka Chinese places during our trip, this was hands down the best. The place is clean, food is good and service was fast. Our waiter seemed new but still did his best and got us everything we needed/wanted. Everything we ordered was good. Some of our favorites include the chicken corn soup, chicken lolipop, chili chicken, and manchurian eggplant (must have!!). We at so much we were stuffed! Looking forward to coming here the next time we take a trip to Canada."}
{"text":"Two stars for the service and cleanliness. Food was not that great. Chowmein was dry and so was the Machurian Chicken. I rather go to Asian Wok n Roll. We had to ask for water. It was too cold inside the restaurant that our food went cold in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm not even a fan of Hakka-style Chinese food and this place continually has me coming back for 8 years. 

You'll find that Hakka style Chinese food is usually very excessive in the way it's prepared, especially pertaining to sauce and such. I find that Ming Room however strays from that. The food is high quality and never regrettable. Good ingredients, always fresh tasting. I've tried most of their menu items and they're all very good- I'm a sucker for their General Tso's chicken.

The staff is very friendly, and unbelievably efficient. A little bit of small talk and the food will be at your table before you even get to wonder about your order's status. The decor is also great, spacious and tasteful. I would recommend this place to just about anyone- I love having lunches here (especially with those prices!)."}
{"text":"This spot is in a convenient location. It is a cute spot with nice decor. It was a little bit too hot for us inside the dining area but otherwise couldnt couldn't complain. We had the $30 dining for two option. It provided a lot of food for that price. We even had enough to feed our son with tons of leftovers to spare. The chili chicken was good. The beef with broccoli was amazing and the chow mein was really amazing as well. I am not a dessert person but the cheesecake was really rich and delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out but since they don't deliver until 5pm, we ordered through skip the dishes.
I ordered vegetable fried rice and it was soooo spicy. I didn't add anything to it but it was more spicy than any fried rice I've ever had.
My son ordered the Hakka chow mein, chili chicken and steamed rice. He said it was good but the chili chicken was extremely spicy. That is his fave dish that he orders everywhere so he has a good perspective on the excessive spice level.
Hubby ordered an assorted appetizer platter which he enjoyed, and some other chicken. No complaints from him but he has a high tolerance for spice.
I'm not sure if he accidentally requested higher spice level when ordering, but he is not aware if he did. If that is their normal spice level, they need to warn customers."}
{"text":"Today was the worst food I have probably ever experienced from this place. Usually Ming Room pumps out relatively good food but sadly today wasn't the case. I ordered Chilli Chicken and to my surprise the dish lacked taste, it was literally like having fried chicken balls with coloured gravy; truly unacceptable and surprising. To those wondering why I didn't say anything, I had already reached home as it was a take-out order and didn't have the patience to drive all the way back. After today's experience this will be my last time visiting Ming Room because not only did it lack taste, the chicken was of a horrible quality. There was HUGE pieces of chicken that were full of fat and I found that extremely disgusting. A fair warning to anyone wanting to visit, don't have the Chilli Chicken."}
{"text":"We went there after 1 year. Food taste has gone down and prices have gone up. 
We ordered salt and pepper shrimp, chicken roll, chicken wanton soup, prawn manchurian.  
All items were average."}
{"text":"Service 4.5* Food 4.5* Ambiance 4*
Going to try Hakka? Try it here. 
Had the variety of Hakka joints east - west end of Toronto. This is the best place in Mississauga. Main reason - not greasy, enjoy the meal even after. It's light and filling. Other places over do it with oil. If you want 'healthier feeling' option. Tastes great. 
This place has all the things the other places lack your not bumping into people and have a hell of time just going in. 
Service - great, friendly & easy to deal. The owner is a good guy. 10% off with cash for take out - bonus! Tried and recommend chili chicken, manchurian chicken, chicken wontons (amazing!), hot & sour soup, zesty fish, chicken pakora and any fried rice, chicken chow mein..didn't love the spring rolls - they were good. frozen take home options. I have a chili chicken sample will try it out. 
Ambiance is good it's not crazy busy and good amount of seating. They have bubble tea and other drinks. 
Eddi's wok n roll is overrated. 
Lin Garden is the east end choice."}
{"text":"Ming is good value for the money. Vegetarian hot and sour soup is great. 
I usually go for lunch and get the spicy chicken chow main , awesome .
Staff is friendly ."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but lately the quality of food has declined tremendously. We ordered the lunch combo and I chose the sweet and sour shrimp combo with rice. Once I got my food I took one bite of the shrimp balls and they tasted so bad that I almost gagged. After complaining to our server about my food l, I re-ordered and had the chili chicken instead. This time the food was JUST OKAY. I managed to eat half of it. The food tastes very old and stale and you can tell that the rice had been sitting out for some time because it was dry and hard to chew. I don't know what happened to the quality of food but it was horrible. I will not be going there again. I am giving it two stars for quick service and price of food. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We ordered off the $30 for 2 prix fixe menu.  It was worth it. The portion was good. Great chance to try a few different dishes on a budget!"}
{"text":"There are 3 Hakka Chinese places that are a stone throw away from each other. Ming Room is one of them and they stand out for good quality of food. The other 2 (Eddie's and Asian Wok n Roll) are cheaper but I rather go to Ming Room for a real meal. 

The restaurant environment is much better than the other two as it has some styling beyond old faded 1980s Oriental Decor or bland office environment.  The service is touch and go.  Depending on who is there, it can be lightning fast and courteous or it can be quick but apathetic.  

The food is served quickly very quickly and it doesn't taste reheated or overdone. At lunch time, this place gets really busy but it still never slows down the service. The dishes are never hidden underneath a layer of goopy brown sauce (like Eddie's). You always get good amounts of meat and vegetables with the right amount of sauce (not goop!). I recommend the beef and brocolli and spicy chilli chicken. It's really spicy but can be tailored so it won't kill your tongue!"}
{"text":"I've ordered Ming Room over a dozen times & am extremely disappointed in how they treat loyal customers. They have delivered my order incorrectly a numerous of times. I called back once to say the order was wrong & I basically got yelled at. I can't do extremely spicy, so I specifically ordered plain & ended up eating something that had my eyes watering.

I've also ordered for pick up. Told them I would be there in 15 minutes to pick it up. Was surprised at how grungy the place looked inside. Went to pick up my food & the guy said he threw my order out cause I was late, when I wasn't. Said he called my house phone nobody answered, I explained I was on my way. Basically more yelling from him.

Very ghetto. Restaurant is gross. Food tastes good, but you can find better food with BETTER customer service."}
{"text":"One of the Hakka-style Halal restaurants located close to others like it. This is a good restaurant. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the food each time. It is fresh and tasty. Sometimes it seems that other Hakka restaurants reheat old food and serve that to you but this restaurant is good. 

I like the service because it's fast and friendly. The decor is also better than some of the other ones. I have read some of the other reviews and it seems that people don't like the food here. Again, I have never had any bad experiences. Each time I have visited, I was left satisfied by the freshness, the temperature, and the service as a whole."}
{"text":"First time did a pickup from here and it was good. Have tried food from most of the Hakka places in Mississauga but these guys are a GOOD competition. Place looks a little run down from the front but the inside is nice. The food was up to the mark though! I picked up a Vegetarian Manchurian, which was yummy! The Szechuan Fish was more sweeter than expected - was more of a sweet and sour style fish - So watch for that when ordering. Also got the Mongolian Beef which was good - the gravy was yummy! That's definitely going to be one I order again. The beef was  cooked perfectly, the gravy was the BOMB - few onions and garlic in there. The aroma and taste was AMAZING. Final overall review was good and will definitely be visiting or picking up food again. PLUS they give fortune cookies and you get a certain percentage off when you pay cash."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Hakka-Chinese food. Came here with some Co-Workers during lunch, I got Manchurian Chicken with fried rice it was less than 8 bucks and more than filling and tasted just perfect, not too spicy and wasnt super salty (which is my usual complain with Hakka-Chinese food). Place was clean and quite busy, thus the service was a little lacking in  quickness, I will definitely be visiting again."}
