{"text":"Torta Cubana is a treat! So are the tacos and the natural beverages are great. A must try!"}
{"text":"Best Carne asada burrito in Las Vegas hands down.  I'm unsure why nobody talks about this place.  Authentic!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I recommend anyone to make a pit stop here and give it a try. Friendly staff serve you great food"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and OH MY GAWD!!! This is the best taco place ever! Will seriously never go to any other place. Seriously I'm super picky when it comes to my tacos and this place is LEGIT!! Definitely  get the asada and el pastor AMAZING!!! Good honest Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I'm constantly searching for amazing Hispanic food in the valley. So many places come and go regardless of whether they're good or not. Unfortunately Vegas is littered with the standard \"Roberto's\" style taco joints. In an unassuming spot in the K-Mart shopping mall on Sunset just east of Pecos lies El Panzon Taco y Torta! You want quality food at amazing prices? You want authentic flavors?! This is the place! I had a chille rellenos plate and a carnitas taco and I have to say, this was the best carnitas in the valley! Flavorful, tender with an aroma that draws you in! I was so full when I finished, but managed to down two more tacos before I reluctantly had to leave. The chille rellenos was large, fresh and had such amazing flavor as well! Fresh made tortillas and chips and salsa when you dine in?! Even the toothpicks are top notch!What?! The staff is soooo nice and so eager to please. It's always good when they truly appreciate your business. I live two miles away and have no idea why I've never been here before, so much time lost! I work hard for my money and don't like spending it on mediocre anything, but I foresee myself spending a large portion of my paycheck and my time in this establishment. Do yourself a favor and do the same!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I wanted to like this place.  Very nice owner/server.  First this is a very tiny place.  Someone posted they ordered a marguerita and I cannot imagine this place ever having a liquor license.  Beverages were pretty much in the can or from the soda fountain only.  That was no big deal but we were hoping to go somewhere where you could have a few drinks.  Had Carne Asada tacos (just OK), Tripe tacos (better than the Carne Asada), Carnitas (probably the best choice) and Adobada (the worst).  We were there with no one else in the place.  Salsa is very good but chips are obviously from a bag (no surprise as this is a tiny low volume restaurant).    We ate our tacos and left wishing we'd tried something else.  Again not bad food but after seeing all the hype here on Yelp, we were very much let down."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Everything is made to order and fresh. Will definitely be back! Best authentic mexican food that I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito since I've moved to Las Vegas in 2004. I'm originally from Los Angeles where all the best Mexican food is made but have been unable to find anything remotely close to it here in Vegas. I've found this place as it's not too far from my office and went there one day.   I've ordered a chorizo burrito with no cheese (no clue if it has cheese. Just everything I order, I must specify \"no cheese\" because I don't like cheese on anything). It took a while for it to be made but once it came out with a side of hot salsa, it was perfection. It was a nice size and perfect price (I believe it's $4.85... I don't pay too much attention as I usually pay $6 to include a tip).  Since then, I've gotten a copy of their business card and learn if I want a burrito, I call ahead and pick it up 10 minutes after I placed my order so I'm not waiting there too long. After reading the reviews from others, I will try their lunch burrito to see if it's just as good."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I'm a self appointed taco snob. This place is great. I was greeted with very friendly service that was genuine. Apparently everything in here is made fresh everyday and is obviously made to order. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The most authentic Mexican restaurant in the valley. Hole in the wall place and totally loved it! Grilled their meat to perfection to add to the smokiness of the crispy edges. You get chips & salsa too! My new favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place with friends and family for about 5 or 6 years now.  The owner of the restaurant seems to work every day of the week, she is the sweetest woman and a phenomenal cook!  Everything on the menu is so tasty, her salsa is THE best, true taco truck style tacos, I love El Panzon! It's my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas to date.  Highly recommend it...and it always feels good to support a small business!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Great prices. I do not speak spanish and have always felt comfortable there."}
{"text":"Oh man.  Oh man.  I want to thank the good people at this fine establishment for giving this gentleman from the NW a serving of the real deal.  For two years now, I have been telling my girlfriend what real Mexican food tastes like.  She has never had it, because they simply don't make it like this here in the Pacific NW (at least not that I am aware of.  Let me know if they do!).  My girlfriend didn't believe me, until we stopped here on our road trip this summer.  We had stopped at place after place on our 4,000-mile trip, only to be disappointed(May.  I was beginning to lose hope of ever showing her the glories of the cuisine.  But then we foudn this place on our way the Nevada.  When we left, she said to me, \"you've ruined me.  I can never go back to another Mexican food place in the NW again.\"  Until places like Tortas Y Tacos El Panzon arrive in the NW, we are left with fond memories of good food, and best wishes for a wonderful little restaurant."}
{"text":"First time eating here and wow they have one of the best street tacos I've ever eaten. Their carne asada tacos were made perfectly. Plus good service."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and my god... It was amazing. Second best taco shop I've ever been to. (when it comes to burritos anyways)  I ordered a California Burrito al Pastor (not on the menu but the very nice lady behind the desk was happy to accommodate my order) and three orders of tacos: one carne asada, and two carnitas.  My burrito was $4.60 and each taco was $1.50. AMAZING prices and it was done in 10 minutes.  The burrito was excellent, second best I ever had even, but the tacos were the real stars. Best I ever had. Also, the place smelled AMAZING when i walked in."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in vegas, traditional style.   I've been here 5 or 6 times, every time I've been very happy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas. Upscale or sit down places do not hold a candle to this joint. It is \"hole in the wall\" but I want an IV of their salsa running through my veins at all times! Heat and flavor. Food great and the owners are crazy nice."}
{"text":"Love the Asada burrito and the tacos. The owners are friendly and it's fairly priced."}
{"text":"Impressed!  Sopes are nice and big and delicious.  Trying this wet sandwich.  I forgot what it's called but it's a wet sandwich and it's off the hook. chips fresh and hot and damn they salsa is not spicy(how I like it) and very good. I'm impressed overall. The quality of meat is great, i been to thousands of taqurias believe me and the meat aint always all that but not this place. two thumbs up. really enjoying my food. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place"}
{"text":"Just what a family run taco shop should be. Daily home made Menudo and Pozole - check. Daily home made agua fresca special - check. Machaca and Chiliquilles  for breakfast - check. And most important an excellent selection of taco meats including savory asada, perfectly roasted, slightly sweet tasting al pastor and crispy tripe.  The new owners Rena and Gonzalo were super friendly and they take great pride in providing fresh, home made food. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for great Mexican food and this is the first place worth writing a review.  I am from Cali and this place feels like home."}
{"text":"I love a hole in the wall so I'm good with the atmosphere. Slow service, great tacos carne asada El pastor. Chile rellenos was middle of the road. Cleanliness was average at best. Not baja style. Someone else said it was L.A. style. Maybe it's a four star place if L.A. is the standard. I wouldn't know, I'm a gringa from Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious home style cooking. My mom had the chile relleno and it was the best she had ever tasted. Don't let the locale dissuade you. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"I didn't have anything from this place other than the the red salsa sauce my in laws brought home. I made my own chicken burrito. I put dat on dat burrittooooooooo and I want to go. Sadly closed but wow will go to try more"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious. It's not the cleanest or quickest place in the world during lunchtime traffic (mostly middle aged males if you care to know) but the tacos were well-seasoned. DO get the 99 cent churro. It's made to order and comes out piping hot."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican food lover i must say that Tacos y Tortas El Panzon has given me to opportunity to try some of the most delicious and authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I was very impressed by their salsas and the quality of their customer service. I will definitely recommend their food and i must say they have the BEST tacos in ALL Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very cheap. Must try carnitas taco, carne Assada nachos, fish taco dang try everything. Come eat my yelp friends look for Gladys she will be smiling behind the counter"}
{"text":"The food here is legit.  Pozole, tacos, tortas... I have a hard time not stopping here on my way home from work so I take Patrick Ln now instead of Sunset. If you love authentic tacos then this is your place. Do yourself a solid and stop by."}
{"text":"I've eaten and a few Mexican spots and I have to say, this is one was real good. The cook is from Zacatecas and she know how to make some good comida. Can't wait to go back and try the Menudo."}
{"text":"Family locally owned business , yay, love those!! A friend liked his burrito which was too big to finish in one meal. I can only rate on the sopes, the only thing I order there since they are so good & not easy to find around Vegas. Love that the owner who is the usual cook in back, will make me a special vegan order with beans, lettuce, tomatoes & avocado.  Traditional food, not Americanized. Which means the salsa is thin, not pico de gallo style, but it's flavorful & I don't really need to fill up on chips & salsa there anyway."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall, but tasty. Was on this side of town with a limited 30 minute lunch, took a coworker. The asada torta, as recommended by Chris V., is awesome and under $6. Would have been better with avocado, but they hadn't received their shipment. Add an additional meat and it's only a dollar more. Colleague opted for a quesadilla and really enjoyed it.  Service was polite, cards accepted, prices are low. Menudo is available daily instead of limited to weekends, as at other places. If you're hunting for homestyle Mexican on a budget, this spot fits the bill."}
{"text":"Food is very authentic and pretty much the closest authentic Mexican close to green valley! Awesome tacos great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Love the NEW owners of Tacos Y Tortas El Panzon! The food was so flavorful and if it weren't for that \"full feeling\", I'd still be eating there right now!! It's a simple place to look at but don't judge a book by its cover...EVERYTHING on the menu is 100% authentic, homemade and so flavorful. Hmmm, how can you tell the food is fresh??? How about they don't have a FREEZER on premises!!! Yep! You. Should. Be. Here. All those other guys don't hold a candle to this place....you thought you were doing authentic with Roberto's or Don Tortaco??? NO WAY! Seriously, this is THE PLACE for REAL MEXICAN FOOD!! Sorry, didn't mean to shout but what if I'm right? Would you seriously want to deprive your taste buds of some AWESOME Food?  You have to check them out!  PS: My faves so far: Carnitas Combo, Wet Burrito mixed with pork & steak, Menudo, Carne Asada Tacos...more updates later!"}
{"text":"Oh man...was it an off day?   2 carnitas sopes were not the best, not the worst either.  The sope itself was too thick, not tasty. I ate only the filling.  Burrito de pollo asado with the works ( guac, crema, queso) came wrapped in paper? The saving grace was they put it on the grill once wrapped.    No horchata.  2 aguas de sandía. .. mostly ice!   Missing bay area taco joints. ...."}
{"text":"I ate here once and can't stop thinking about how refreshing the Horchata is. It's so rich and cool on contact. Tacos were decent, a little tough to chew. But seriously though, the Horchata is bomb. Thanks for the horchata. Ok, you get it, how many times did I mention the horchata in this review.   ...That's the point."}
{"text":"Tortas are wonderful. Might've been hangry in my older review. Place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"A very good taco and totally spot. And their prices are very reasonable. I like that their salsa is on the spicy side. Reminds me of tacos back home in California. I recommend the Asada tacos and the torta. Their meats are very flavorful and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Exactly the kind of place I look for, a Great little family run taco place.  The owner is very kind and takes a lot of pride in what they serve.  We had the mix torta with carne asada and carnitas, burrito with bean and cheese for the kids, and about 8 different tacos.  I really liked the pastor and carnitas tacos, very authentic with meat onions cilantro and hot sauce.  We had a couple of churros that were great, they even tossed an extra one in because they wanted to make sure my wife got one too.  Price was very affordable and the place was clean, we will come back."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my work. So today I figured I'd give it a try and I was so excited because it looked legit! So let's do this chronologically:  I start by asking the cashier what is in their tortas aside from your choice of meat. She lists off a few ingredients including: beans, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, avocado, etc. I feel like she said there were more things included in the torta but maybe that was it. Maybe she said salsa? So I order a Torta de Milanesa with everything except tomato. No tomato. And an horchata to drink. I ordered dine-in because I didn't feel like going back to my windowless office to eat. So far so good, and the lady seems nice enough.   She gives me my horchata immediately and I turn to look for a seat. I had to take the empty chip basket and salsa dishes off my table before sitting because it hadn't been cleaned yet. I see three people come up and place an order after I've taken my seat. I've been sitting there for a while and realize I haven't been brought any chips and salsa - no biggie, I don't need it.   About 15 minutes go by - I'm still waiting for my food and I just watched two of the people who came in after me get their food and leave. The lady comes to my table and I'm thinking she's bringing my torta - NOPE: chips and salsa. At least the chips were warm. The salsa was tasty but a little weak on the spice level.   Over 5 minutes go by and I see the 3rd person get their order and walk out. As I'm turning to say something to the lady - she comes out with my torta. It took over 20 minutes just to get my food. I'm thinking - if the food is worth it, I'll just place my order over the phone ahead of time next time.   The torta de milanesa was decent at best.  First - the ONE specification I made was NO TOMATO. It had FOUR slices of tomato - which is really generous if you happen to like tomato - which I don't. The bread was slightly over-toasted so it had a slight burnt taste; there were NO jalapenos on my torta; and they skimped on the avocado. The least I can say is that it tasted good, but after 20 minutes I expected something MUCH better.   Needless to say - I'm not in a rush to return to this place. The service was slow and my meal was disappointing. Maybe in a few weeks or months I'll give it a 2nd try - after I've made my rounds at the other local Mexican places."}
{"text":"Amazing Place!! Let me tell you, coming from a Mexican that grew up on home cooked meals, if you are looking for a place that makes The freshest & most Authentic Mexican dishes its this place for sure!..  None of that Roberto's taco or  Lindo Michoacán bull, This lady is the real deal straight home cooked meals type of deal!     & when you go in there be open to the other types of meats on the menu., trust me when I say dnt be a Sissy, expand your palates, then you'd be able to understand Great Food.."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that from the outside looks like any other \"robertos's burritos\" restaurant, but is far from it. I ordered the carne asada tacos , and french fries. The tacos were delicious. The meat was tender and was cooked to perfection. The fries are HOMEMADE. Not too oily , not too soggy; the outside was crispy with a soft texture on the inside. Each bite of the fries reminded of the homemade fries my gramma used to make when I was a kid. The fries came with 3 dipping sauces which looked homemade as well and each one complimented the fries very well.  While you wait on your order , they bring you hot fresh tortilla chips with three different salsas ranging from mild to hot.  You have an array of different drink choices to wash down the delicious food including horchata and Mexican bottle Coke.  Great customer service as well !"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The employees were very friendly when I arrived. I went with Camarrones Rancheros. It was great and well worth the $11."}
{"text":"I can never stop Raving about this hole in the wall Mexican food place.  I believe it is family run. The food always has the same consistency of flavor and portion size.. If you eat there they bring you fresh chips and 2 homemade salsa's. If your like my husband cant handle hot  lol they do have a mild one  I love the carne Asada tacos!! Tons of meat, cilantro, onion and sauce!! My husband always gets bean and cheese burritos with cilantro and onion!! Such an amazing combination and great flavor.. Give this little Gem of a place a try you shouldn't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Mom is in the back cooking?  you got that right!  everything I have tested here has been on point.  Menudo, posole, tacos, tortas.  I usually call in my order but have eaten there before.  They bring out chips and salsa while you wait and usually have some Spanish music pumping.  I like this place.  Way better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"worst mexican food I have ever had. they manage to murder the beans and I don't know how that is even possible. I'm not sure how they manage to have a 4.5 stars when they can even make good beans.  very disappointed we will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place pooped up for lunch, so we thought why not Mexican. Really happy we did!!! Not much to look at from the outside, or really the inside, but the Food was AMAZING! We tried a little of everything. Combination plate, torts, and tacos... Couldn't put our forks down. I will recommend this place to everyone I know who's looking for a quick Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town,  the fajitas are delicious and the carnitas are OMG!! The bomb. Fast service  very friendly highly recommended to anyone that's in town, and even if your not from vegas it's a must try."}
{"text":"It's was soon good. I ordered the avocado torta and told them to add steak. Best torta I have ever had!!!  Service was great, I think the owner himself came to check on us and refill our drinks. Price was great."}
{"text":"Authentic and tasteful tacos! I had the carnitas and carne asada, both were great but I would gravitate towards the carnitas more. Nice little hole in wall"}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how much I love Tacos and how much time I have spent finding the good little taco places in town and this is one!!  On a side note They also have a juicer where I can get fresh fruit or vegi drinks for breakfast!  Customer service is great and food is fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"So I literally just walked in to try what looks like excellent Mexican but halfway to the counter, a massive cockroach scurried across the floor! That's all I need to see to turn around and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A hole in one! Score!!!...is what I felt after eating here.  This is literally a hidden gem in a hole in the wall. Everyone likes tacos but you have to admit we all LOVE authentic style street tacos. In Las Vegas or anywhere for that matters most every restaurant is trying to duplicate Mexican street tacos but it is just never the same.   Our order consisted of...yes you guessed it...TACOS! Carne Asada, Lengua, and Pastor. The tortillas are grilled perfectly as it is slightly brown on the outside. the Asada and Pastor we asked to be grilled extra giving every bite that light crisp texture. Both had a wonderful marination which you can still taste even after the extra grilling. The Lengua was nice and tender and full of flavor. All three were dressed with the traditional onions and cilantro and a splash of lime. If you dine in you will be served with nice warm tortilla chips and 3 various salsas (2 red and 1 green...all equally tasty and spicy).   Definitely a place worth trying if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"From a service standpoint I would have given Tortas Y Tacos El Panzon Five glowing stars. It's clear that this is a family run operation and the two ladies working were fantastic the day my wife and I ate here. I was considering a bean & cheese burrito so they allowed me to test their beans (1 extra star given just for this).   So let's get to the food itself. After trying the beans (they were very good) I decided to go with a combo plate, Cheese Enchilada's with Rice & Beans while my wife ordered the Bean & Cheese burrito with extra cheese - there can never be enough cheese.   The first problem we had wasn't with the food, but with our beverage options. They ran out of coke in their fountain drinks. That narrowed the choices down to Diet Coke, Sprite, and Fanta Orange - all wonderful in their own right, just not for me. Minimal damage (but shouldn't you have extra's??). So then came the chips and salsa, which was a nice surprise considering this is a taco shop. The major problem was with the entree's. Portion size was fantastic with my enchilada's. The rice and beans were far above average. The problem was the enchilada's. There is no way that these were fresh. The red sauce looked as though it had been sitting on the tortilla's for quote some time - almost as if they were made days in advance then microwaved warm. I understand most Mexican restaurants pre-make several of their dishes, I take no issue with that. However, when it's completely obvious that these aren't relatively fresh I have a major problem. It's too bad because they actually tasted pretty good, I can only imagine how good they would be if they were fresh...The next issue was with my wife's bean and cheese burrito. The cheese tasted old. Bleh. Not good, very bad. When you have an item with three key components (tortialla, beans, cheese) and one of them is jacked up, it messes up everything. I tasted the cheese, it wasn't good. It's too bad, from a service standpoint this place was pretty good, from a quality standpoint it was pretty bad. **No one got sick, but we both felt pretty bad a few hours after eating here.   I doubt I'll give Tortas Y Tacos El Panzon a second chance since Pepe's Taco's 7 or 8 minutes down the road."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! They have a special for 3 tacos with beans and rice for about $6 which is hard to beat! I got the carne asada and al pastor tacos which were pretty bomb. The meat was fresh and juicy. The red sauce they put on there was flavorful with a kick. TBH I am a wuss with spice but for any spice rookies, I'd get it on the side.   My friend got the banana shake and it was HUGE and tasted like real banana. I'm picky with banana flavored anything and can't stand artificially flavored crap.   My other friend got the pozole and it was pretty flavorful. I would definitely recommend it!  The staff was friendly and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch at least once a week, I recently brought my friend who is from Mexico here and loved it! The tacos el Pastor/Adobada are simply awesome, sweet and spicy and just perfect, if you go to a Mexican chain over this place you are missing out. Its a bit of a hole in the wall but do not let that fool you, its awesome. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Food was really greasy, and the carne asada was horrible, I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles California I grew up with traditional Mexican parents and traditional Mexican food.  Since moving to Nevada I have been to numerous taco shops some ok, some horrible!!!  After coming here I was an immediate regular. This place is the most authentic taco shop I have been to in southern Nevada. The food is excellent, great taste. The lady's that work their are very nice and humble. I feel like I'm at my moms kitchen!  If you don't mind a hole in the wall and are looking for authentic Mexican food then this is it.  I don't usually write reviews but this place is definitely worth the time to let people know about my experience(s)."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!!! It's always nice to see little Mexican food spots! It's places like these that always have close to home tasting food.  Came with my hubby and friends and tried the quesadilla with adobada and it was BOMB! Also had the nachos with carne asada, MAN! They were quite delicious!!!! Def will be be coming back!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place, and heard it was good so me and my fiancé decided to stop by to try it. She got carne asada tacos and I got the burrito. I guess there was a special going on so the burrito was half off! All and all everything tasted great. I really liked their spicy salsa they gave us and the food tasted home cooked. Not greasy at all & in such a convenient location for those looked for good Mexican food living in Henderson this is the place! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Found this little Mexican place near E Sunset and Pecos! Restaurant is under new management. The service was fast and they were very friendly. They were about to close when I walked in.  A family of 6 walked in after me as well, the staff welcomed them kindly!  The restaurant sits about 30 personnes. It's not chic put food is delicious!!!  Was talking to the new owner, he said down the road he will remodel it and make it more homey  had some steak tacos with green sauce and lime SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Their hours say they close at 7:00 pm.  But when I pulled up at 5:50 pm they turned off the lights and locked the door.  I guess another business's will get my $$."}
{"text":"It seems as if I cannot find a legit Mexican restaurant in Vegas, all the best ones are definitely in California! I came here because I had a taco craving. I ordered carne asada tacos to go and waited about a good 10 minutes, mind you there was no one ahead of me. There was limited seating since most of the tables were dirty and still had plates on them. When I got home, I was starving. I took my first bite and it felt as if my mouth was on fire! I usually like a little kick but this was honestly too much. I'm not sure what kind of salsa/sauce that was but I will order without from now on. Tacos were okay, not great. Probably will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Now this is what you call Mexican food... The best tacos, tortas, fajitas & carnitas... This is the spot to come to...I just love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite part of the meal is the chips and salsa, you get 2 flavors both are super delicious. Expect to wait a bit for your food sometimes I is only one person working, but always worth it."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had a churro so delicious! I spend a ton of time on the road with my band and this is hands down the best Mexican breakfast we've stumbled across. The owners are delightful and the food is fresh, handmade with love and DELICIOUS. Do yourself a favor and try the green salsa. Any time we route through Vegas, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great street tacos and a mean carne asada burrito. Their hot sauce has got a really nice kick to it and will leave your tastebuds flaring. To go Service was really good as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Homemade Mexican food everything made from scratch. The lady running the front you can see she is the owner and proud of the food she is serving. Wasn't expecting the food to be so good, finished the food before I could take a picture . We ordered 3 orders of churros, they were so fantastic we ordered the last 3 she had."}
{"text":"They have the best Carne asada burritos and chorizo breakfast burritos and fish tacos and salsa ever. Don't forget to get some roasted jalapeños on the side"}
{"text":"Ok so I don't normally do this but this place is FREAKING AMAZING! The ladies behind the counter are super nice and helpful(for non Spanish speaking people) and you can tell they enjoy their jobs. If you are dining there they serve chips and salsa for you while you wait. It's not a fancy restaurant but it's cozy and you can relax while eating. The food isn't pricey and the quality is amazing. The tacos are so good. Wish I ordered more. And the torta was just as delicious. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Yum, yummy, yum and super inexpensive.  Taco meats have incredible flavor, red salsa was amazing, and chips were fantastic.  The service was friendly too."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly staff.  Al Pastor burrito was delicious. Fish taco was huge, however the yellow mustard was very off putting for me personally.  Never even knew that was a thing.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The carne asada was pretty good but I wouldn't go back. No napkins in the holder and there were dead gnats in the soda machine. Very gross."}
{"text":"This place is looks like it's a little run down but it was really good and the service was great. The cashier was really nice and very helpful. They had a good chicken burrito special with a drink for $5.99 and it was delicious. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos! Carnitas and adobada were the best. Chicken was excellent as well. Carne asada was good, but nothing special. $1.60 per taco is about as cheap as you can find. I would've easily paid more for these tacos. Simple street tacos, but so flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Well my dad enjoyed his food very much however I didn't care for mine as much. The tacos were great but I didn't care too much for the sopes usually when I go get sopes they are bit smaller and with more meat but I felt like I was eating tortilla and beans. I did like how cute the little place was and how it was quiet inside and the nice young lady who works there. I just wished I would have enjoyed the food more."}
{"text":"Very good reminded me of Rosarito Beach. They increased their prices for the carne asada tacos combination plate from $8.50 to11.35  . time to find someone else!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos I've had in Vegas so far. Finally a place that has real meat and authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for drinks and a Vegas scene then go to the strip. If you want great food with great service from a nice hole in the wall place then this is it. Everything tasted home made and this will be my Mexican food choice every time in Vegas."}
{"text":"great tacos, so good you dont need to add any thing for flavor i would recommend"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was reminded of the hole-in-the-wall mom & pop taquerias down in San Diego that I miss so much. Taco Bell this was definitely not...and I was instantly excited to try their food!  I ordered a carnitas burrito, my standard fast food Mexican restaurant order so that I could compare it with carnitas past. The cashier asked if I wanted \"everything\" on it. Figured she meant carnitas, pico de gallo and guacamole. Nope, she meant everything: carnitas, rice, beans, pico de gallo, a healthy handful of very fresh cilantro. It was stuffed!  Got it to go and when I got back to my office about 15 minutes away, I was happy to find it was still hot when I unwrapped it. But then I realized there hadn't been a salsa bar and I forgot to ask for sauce. :(  The first bite revealed that it didn't need sauce at all! Everything was perfectly spiced and delicious. I don't remember stopping to breathe the entire time I was demolishing it...it was THAT good. (I did manage to pause long enough to photograph it though; photo in the gallery.)  Can't wait to return again this weekend. Heck, who am I kidding? Can't wait to return tomorrow! YUM!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurants and conveniently located not too far from me.    When you dine in, they serve you with 2 types of salsas and chips: the bigger salsa bowl is a mild/medium flavored salsa while the smaller bowl is spicy salsa, which has a great amount of spice to it.  I'm pretty sure that's why they give you a smaller serving bowl incase you can't handle it.    I've had their chorizo plate that comes with rice and semi-refried beans.  I like their refried beans because it tastes fresh, and it's not 100% mashed, so you'll still be able to see some beans there.    There are some mexican places where they serve you a load of protein and beans with very little spanish rice.  Well, this place will give you a good amount of spanish rice to go with your plate.    Last time, I got the carne asada plate for $10.  I was expecting some diced carne asada meat, but to my amazement, I got 3 decent size strips of carne asada.  Flavor was as if it has been marinating in awesomeness for a few hours.  I had a big plate, but the flavor was so good, I made the clean plate club.  I would definitely get this carne asada plate again!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and refried beans. It was all very good especially the beans, which I ordered an extra side for $1.08. The plate  definitely had a bit of a kick to it, which I liked.  Definitely a family run restaurant... about 5 or 6 were at a table when I walked in, A bit intimidating at first, but they were welcoming. The owner told me that everything was fresh.. no freezer!!!  Chips and salsa was ok. The only thing I would add would be to offer sone extra sauce/salsa's to go with the meal like other places do.  All in all, it was a very nice lunch and I will be back for more..."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you're craving authentic Mexican food and are sick of Taco Bell (because Taco Bell sucks). It's a hole-in-the-wall that actually serves tripa and lengua, so you KNOW this place gets down!  It's cheap and family-owned, so the owners/waiters are very nice and attentive. Don't waste your time going to Roberto's...if you're in Henderson, try this place. They have weird hours but I think because of their location, they don't get much action."}
{"text":"So today is taco Tuesday so as I was driving up sunset on my hunt for some grub... I ran across this place.. now when u walk in it may seem a Lil shady but don't let that run u off... the crappy Mexican decor and religious shrine behind the counter add to the ambiance lol  Now to the tacos... f**k that's delicious was what came to mind after the 1st bite... I opted for my go to Carne Asada street tacos... now usually taco joints use a flat grill to cook there meat which I don't feel like gives it the best texture or flavor... now this place idk how they cook it but it has a flame grilled slightly burnt taste but still tender and falls apart... the tortillas I doubt were home made but they were cooked well.. not to soft to where u r taco explodes from the bottom just right... the beans and rice well I'll tell u this AMAZING... they were both actually seasoned, who woulda thought...  their red sauce was also great I put a Lil on everything because I like red sauce...   I'll definitely be going back again...."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Since I missed breakfast, I decided to have a machaca burrito. My burrito was absolutely delicious, and it came with chips and a very spicy but tasty salsa. Also, the couple up front were super nice and welcoming. I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos, best burritos, taquitos, churros etc, very authentic yummy Mexican food, I went by myself the first time and I loved it , next time I took my coworkers and they were super delighted, took my family on my day off and we all ordered something different, absolutely everything we tasted was delicious, the owners and cooks are very friendly and attentive, Tacos and Tortas El Panzón is now my favorite Mexican place for Mexican food, I extremely recommend it"}
{"text":"Finally something close to home that is not a Roberto's!  I've been searching for a place to grab some legit tacos without it being a sit-down restaurant or making a drive outside of Henderson for quite sometime. I turned to yelp for my search and they recommended this place. Thanks yelp, I owe you one.   Upon arrival today, 1/16/13, I thought the place was closed. The inside was dark compared to the Port of Subs and Smoke shop it sits in between. Yet to have eaten, I exited the car with my fingers crossed. The door was unlocked - yes! With no one in sight, not even an employee, i walked up to the counter. (If i had to cook the food myself i would have, i was starving.) Luckily, an employee popped her head from behind the kitchen. She was kind and let me know that all the tacos were a $1.40, even the carne-asada tacos which are usually more expensive at other places i've been. I ordered four (two chicken, one pork, one carne) with everything, to go.   As I drove home, the delicious scent of the tacos were louder than my sound system. I picked up the bag to get a better whiff. Somehow it escaped me but the tacos were not in a box or container, but on a paper plate wrapped in tin-foil. For some reason, I liked it! It made me feel like i just came from a house party and took someones mothers authentic home-cooked tacos as a parting gift.   The tacos were STUFFED with meat. So much, that i had to take the second layer of tortilla and make a makeshift additional taco. (Am i the only who does that?) The chicken, was good. The carne-asada, not the best.(probably wouldn't get it again) The pork, the pork literally brought tears to my eyes, the reason why i'm even writing this, is for the pork taco. All praises to the pork taco.   I have to go back and get more of the pork tacos, maybe even tomorrow - maybe even tonight. When ever i do return, i definitely want to dive more into the menu as well.   With the price and quality of the meat per taco, I recommend this place. The carne-asada may have been a fluke today and thats the only reason i can't give it a full 5-stars.  Until next time. And if you know of a place (preferably in Henderson) with similar prices and tacos that you think are just as good - let me know."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito and it was delicious. Don't be fooled by the plain exterior. They are a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I remember coming here a few years ago and the food was GREAT! I recently visited this place as i was in the area and was very disappointed. The food was mediocre this time around maybe the regular cook was out... I will try this place again and hopefully it taste the same as I remember."}
{"text":"it's hard to believe I haven't reviewed this place since I work close to it and some co workers have brought me here on occasion. Service is fast and the food is always stellar. I order the same lunch almost every time narrowing it down to a torta cubana or torta milanesa or fish taco's. The tortas is are pretty good here. packed with flavor and the grilling of the bun ands the added texture. it's close to work and I never had a bad experience so I come here when I am in the mood for Mexican, time to start ordering other dishes to see how they are."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, my friends were craving some authentic Mexican food. So we drove to this hole-in-the-wall and found a meal worth coming back for.  \"This is the best burrito I've ever had in my life,\" said one person while others nodded their heads because they were too busy chewing.  I had the carnitas tacos, which were to die for, and my other friend enjoyed her fajitas. Would highly recommend any of the burritos though!"}
{"text":"I grew up in SoCal so I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. I've been looking for a taqueria place that matches back to one at home and now I don't have to look further! Ta-da!!! This place is even better than some of the best taqueria places I have had. Def check it out! And the owner is also super sweet and I'm always glad to nom nom here and help her business. :)"}
{"text":"OMG the tortas are rediculously good.  Visiting from AZ my wife and I tried the torta cubana and torta mexicana.  Soooooo fresh and delicious.  Were  only in town a couple more weeks but we cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The place was sold a couple of months ago, food doesn't taste as good as before, I'm very disappointed, I had to remove this place from my bookmarks on yelp, what a shame!"}
{"text":"I must say this place has an excellent chorizo breakfast burrito! Get it with everything. Great love in all their dishes."}
{"text":"I have been searching for good Mexican food since I moved here December 2011. I had a place I loved in AZ and even found a place in Alaska of all places but for some reason Vegas was lacking in my kind of Mexican food! Being pregnant, when you crave something, you go somewhat crazy till you get it, so in desperation I came on yelp to find something with some good reviews and found El Panzon! My hubby and I left immediately to try it and I got the green chicken enchiladas and I was SO pleased! Now I can have my Mexican fix when I crave it, which happens a lot! Thanks to all the previous reviewers who saved me from going crazy from cravings!"}
{"text":"Felt like getting some street tacos so I yelped street tacos in found that this place was right down the street from me. I was there on a Sunday at noon and when I walked in there were no customers but a few dirty tables. I walked up to the counter and ordered three street tacos and the complimentary chips and salsa. I sat down and she brought me some chips with basically water with some cilantro in it. I would rate this salsa a zero so I had low hopes for the street tacos but when they arrived, they were delicious. I ordered one chorizo, one pork and one steak taco. All three were delicious but my favorite was the chorizo. The pork was a little fatty, I would not order that one again but the steak and chorizo were yummy! Cost of the meal was under $7 which also included a bottle of water that I ordered. Very inexpensive. I can still only rate this place a three despite the delicious street tacos because it was the worst salsa ever."}
{"text":"Went here recently and this place is pretty good.   Although, make sure you have plenty of time if you go during the lunch rush. The same lady who does your ordering, cashiering, also is your cook and your waitress!  I'm a little wary of the ants roaming around...not sure what I'll find roaming in the back if they let ants around freely...but I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and just give stars based on the food.   Good flavor, tastes authentic, sweet staff, I mean, sweet person."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh ingredients and excellent service. We got one of each kind tacos, all of them tasted delicious. We got additional salsa and chips free. Decent prices, quick service. Definitely coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Finally found a Mexican restaurant that is great! We came on a Monday and there was only 2 women and it is a very tiny place with cheap looking menus but I was very pleased with the food. They were very friendly. We ordered bean and cheese burrito a, shredded beef nachos, beef fajitas plate, a sad a tacos and rice and beans. Spent 40 bucks for all of it. The asada tacos are 1.40 a piece as well as the other meats.   They brought out 3 different kinds of salads and all three were great and different. The fajitas portion was a great size and full of flavor!!!!! The asada tacos were some of the beat I have had here in vegas, the beans were so yummy, and the nachos were so good and so cheap! The presentation of the nachos was awesome as well. I will definitely be back to visit even though its a good 30 minutes away. And would definitely recommend this to everyone for some good Mexican!"}
{"text":"It was decent, regular Mexican place. I had a torta, it was okay. The bread could be more fluffy or buttery tasting. I do like that they're not just a taco shop though."}
{"text":"Loved the sauces. Wonderful depth & complexity.   Carne asada was perfect.   Clean & neat.   Very friendly staff.  Nothing fancy - just darn good food!  Wish I lived closer - I'd be a frequenter, most definitely."}
{"text":"4 stars for polite service, dine in free chips, and housemade taco tortillas! Asada meat was decent and tasted marinated. Cabeza meat seemed good, but there wasn't much on my taco to tell. The tortillas were delicious. Offered mild or spicy salsa. Although they didn't have an unfilled churro, the cream churro tasted good. The cream didn't make the churro extra sweet, rather I barely noticed it and it just felt like the inside was gooey, which I enjoyed since I much prefer unfilled churros. Taco $1.60 and churro $0.99. I'll be back if I'm in the area! Def agree with the other reviewer about picking this spot over robertos."}
{"text":"Legit mexican food, decent prices, close to my house. A half step above Roberto's, etc, in quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very sorry to write this review.  The oil used to fry chips was old and unable eat the burrito.  The service was good but the food is very bad."}
{"text":"If \"awesome hole in the wall Mexican joint\" was a dictionary term, you'd see a picture of this restaurant in Webster's.  I was first here around a year ago and ordered a fairly safe carne asada torta. I think it was under $5 then, and it's still under $5 now. We had a fairly large group and kinda overwhelmed the small kitchen, so we had to take our entrees to go after eating some chips and salsa while still in the restaurant. The torta was really awesome, although I was disappointed that I had to eat it in a hurry.  Today, I made my own taco sampler with one each of the buche, cabeza, adobada, and carne asada tacos.  $1.40 is a tough price to match, but what's even more important is how great they all tasted!  I started with the buche, which purports to be from a pig's esophagus but ate a lot like some roast pork I've had with great crisped up skin. The crunchiness was different from what I've had before. Next up was carne asada, which was probably my favorite because it was just so packed with savoriness. The adobada was almost as good and carried plenty of sweetness, and it didn't suffer from overcooked meat syndrome even though I had walked into an empty restaurant. Finally, the cabeza was definitely good and wasn't even completely fatty. There was also some solid yet still soft head meat.  For all you people who are currently nuts about tacos over on Tropicana, head on to this strip mall near Sunset and Sandhill and park right next to Port of Subs, and make sure to give yourself enough time. You'll love this place."}
{"text":"The best service u can ask for! There food is the Bomb! I had the pescado and it was delicious!  Authentic Mexican food is the best! Thanks for the great service !!!"}
{"text":"It has been quite a while since we have been here, and my husband was craving their tacos. He remembers how fresh the food was, and made to order.   Sure enough, our food was made to order and came out steaming hot. I love that! We got two tacos pastor, and one carne asada. The homemade tortillas were really good. I love the slight sweetness from the pineapple in the pastor. They were not overly seasoned, and tasted great.   We were given warm tortilla chips and one salsa. The salsa was rather bland, but I could not stop eating the chips anyway. The fountain drinks were out of order, and there was no horchata. Bummer there, but they offered us canned soda or bottled water instead.   The tacos were hot, tasty and fresh. The ladies working were very friendly. From the outside this places does not look the greatest, but the food is worth the visit."}
{"text":"We had a bowl of menudo, posole and a carne Asada burrito. All the food was delicious, Not greasy nor old. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"WIth so many Roberto's and Laurita's restaurants around the Vegas Valley we decided to give this place a shot while waiting for our movie at the nearby Galaxy Theatre. We were greeted and seated down immediately and was served some home made warm tortilla chips with in house made salsa. Which was actually very good, if I could buy a jar I definitely would! We had the Tacos with carne asada , al pastor , and carnitas. All the meat was tender and juicy  and had a good amount piled on the double corn tortillas. If you want a home style cooked mexican meal I would suggest Tacos Y Toras El Panzon if you are in the eastside of the Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"So yes the lady that cooks is really good at cooking real Mexican home made meals the only thing i asked to use the restroom and as i was walking to the back where its at and i got very scared and disgusted that that kitchen was so dirty and i can only imagine where my food was cooked so as i was grabbing a toilet seat cover i came across a big cockroach it was so scary and ran out of the restroom and didn't finish my food i don't think i will ever go back they need to deep clean that back kitchen its so gross ... Even tho the lady does know how to cook with great taste she needs to get them workers  cleaning because its not worth loosing ur business for not keeping it clean i mean it is a restaurant just saying ...."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's just a great place for authentic Mexican food. The family running the business is so nice and the food is amazing. Served with warm fresh tortilla chips and good fresh salsa, the lengua and chicken tacos were really good. The best part was seeing that everyone there looked happy. Would give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"big fan, the tortas are outstanding, but everything so far I have tried is great!"}
{"text":"I came in cause of the reviews. Come in. I get charged for chips n salsa when it's free. Ordered food had the whole order wrong. Still waiting for chips n salsa. . Didn't get the service that I thought was provided.     Food was cold tacos r Dry!!!!  Won't come back !!!!"}
{"text":"Walking around I found this small Mexican spot. I came in and saw they had a wide variety of tortas and taco.. As well as mariscos..  So I'm in the mood for breakfast and ordered the machaca plate.. First they bring a salsa and chips, which chips are good, salsa was good you get two. The dark red salsa has a very good taste as well a small kick to it. The other salsa is lite pico de gallo.. No kick to it.. The plate of machaca comes with rice, beans and a salad.. Not too shabby, it's not a bad deal for seven bucks!! Including a drink... I'll come back again.. Service is second to none.."}
{"text":"Delicious. The food was so full of flavor. Great prices. I got the chicken fajitas and the chicken was delicious. Really great spot for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"$1.60 a taco! Flavorful, tender meat. Really liked the carnitas and carne asada. Made to order guacamole.  If this place had a salsa bar too, it would have been 5 star for me (and it's rare for me to give those out)"}
{"text":"El Panzon is soliddddddd. I had a lengua taco, a pastor taco, and an asada burrito for about $9 bucks and I was crazzyyy full.  The meats are all rich and well seasoned while the portions of rice, beans, sour cream, and cheese were so good they just made me miss California. Of the mexican joints I tried in vegas, so far Panzon is my favorite"}
{"text":"Tacos are Great!!! Love the pozole it is very very  delicious and I also enjoy the torta ahogada with the salsa picosa that is served on the side."}
{"text":"I went because I work down the street & was craving tacos. They were AMAZING! Very nice service, amazing food! I was amazed at the flavor of everything from the meat & even the salsa verde.. omg SOOOOO GOOD!! The woman at the front counter was very helpful & very sweet! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food,  This place is one of those little hole in the wall that will surprise you. Great flavors, clean and friendly, no need for too much introductions, just go and try the food and you'll be pleased!! (If you like menudo, they have a great one,  Clean and fresh) Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Chimichangas are very good and filling....couldn't finish it. The salsa was decent and slightly spicy.  Had a peach Margarita...very yummy and strong."}
{"text":"Growing up in a household eating delicious authentic Mexican food, I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I would like to say that El Panzon is as close as I've found to the taquerias in Tijuana and my mom's cooking. My mom rocks, just saying...   My favorite thing to order here are their tacos. I love to order buche, lengua and tripa. Yeah, these might not be for everyone, but they are my personal favorites. If you aren't an adventurous eater, you can't go wrong with their carnitas or carne asada tacos. My boyfriend also loves their chicken tortas as well as their sopes.   Not only are their tortas, tacos, sopes and huaraches amazing, they also have great people working there. Rosy is a sweetheart! I have yet to ask her if she is the owner. She very well may be since she's always there. She knows me by name and even recognizes me over the phone when I call in my order. I'm so happy to have this awesome hole in the wall near me."}
{"text":"Excellent hole in the wall Mexican food. Highly recommend. Had the beef tacos and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Just ordered tacos and enchiladas today, and they were a huge disappointment. Took a few bites of the enchiladas opened them up the chicken looked off they didn't taste good, so I threw them out. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos. Especially the Carnitas. Everything is made to order too so you're a fool if you go somewhere where the meat has been sitting for hours.  Free chips and salsa even if you're just getting a few tacos. And they offered me a free limeade which isn't on the menu yet but should be its so refreshing.   I've seen people wait hours for certain tacos when compared to this place they are lacking... This is the legit taco shop."}
{"text":"Wow!  Delicious!!!  So fresh it will leave your mouth watering after your full.  And the owner and chef  is wonderfully friendly.  Wow!"}
{"text":"I come to this place for their carne asada tacos and went there yesterday they didn't have it so I tried their pork carnitas tacos and the adobada I was pretty impressed they are both really good too! So I'm glad they didn't have the carne asada so it forced me to try something else"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada and it took them 20 minutes.  Then the older guy behind the counter hands me my bag with the plate sideways.  All my food is mixed up in the plate.  Great service guys.  What a joke.  I just took one bite of the meat and chewed it for 20 minutes.  They use cheap cuts of meat that has tendon and gristle.  I will be stopping by to ask for a refund. Do not believe any of the positive reviews and if you do not believe me, then go for it and try the place for yourself."}
{"text":"First of all the service here was amazing, the lady at the cash register had a smile on her face the whole time and made sure my boyfriends order was custom for his pickiness. I got two tacos and a carne asada burrito. They were both really tasty but the portions were just kinda small, maybe I'm used to bigger sizes in California. Overall for taste is 10/10 yummy. I would just order a little more next time."}
{"text":"Thank God!!! Finally I discovered a great taqueria in this city. LA mexican food is the best and I miss it every second of every day. This place can satisfy my need for tacos til I can get back home and stuff my face.  I've never understood how a city with a large Mexican population could have such awful Mexican food. Like that nasty place that starts with a R....., people like that here and have the nerve to call it Mexican food. Listen, if you think Mexicans eat carne asada fries you should be punched."}
{"text":"I went here because of all the reviews on here but quickly turned away when I saw the giant \"C\" the health department had given them."}
{"text":"Small little family owned place in a KMart shopping center. I stopped here on my lunch break and ordered a carne asada burrito. The service was great and the owners were super friendly. I got my burrito within 5 minutes, and it was so delicious. You can tell they use quality meat by the way it melts in your mouth.. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick bite of some quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was bomb!! Got a machaca bfast burrito and it was so good. AND it didn't leave me feeling too full and gross afterwards. To me that means they must not cook with too much oil and use quality ingredients. The married couple who took my order who I'm assuming are the owners were super sweet and definitely take customer service seriously. I like that!!"}
{"text":"Nothing less than amazing friendly service and delicious fresh food! Never had such good food so quick was in the mood for street tacos and I have never had better, so glad we stopped in we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a vegan breakfast burrito.  They have fresh ingredients and great service, but the burrito was nothing special.  I wanted sautéed potatoes, but they would the only option was deep-fried."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating here and both times were outstanding. First time had  asada burrito wet, the second time had carnitas combo. Super tasty and delicious, another big point for me is it is a family owned small business so get out and support them."}
{"text":"Such a little gem! The food was amazing - small place, two super friendly ladies (one In the front one cooking). Food tastes homemade and was really good. My husband had the menudos - a tripe soup that is not very common and very few places have it. He loved it! Also, they have the real deal tacos - you can get the usual but also the more rare tongue or trips tacos.  Overall, we were super impressed with the food, the price, and the ladies. We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"So growing up near the Mexican border, I can tell you which Mexican restaurants are the real deal and which ones are posers. This one is one of the few in Las Vegas that can hold a flame to those true authentic restaurant. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks the food seemed old. I got some rolled chicken tacos the chicken was so old looking it wasn't even funny.. don't bother waisting your time here save it for some where that has greasy food!!"}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent. Other day my husband went in and ordered breakfast burrito and waited about 15 mins. He asked guy how much longer guy said 45 mins for breakfast burrito.  seriously. We asked for refund and went somewhere else. Had to get to work. He did apologize...."}
{"text":"Great lil spot. A bit dark, if you don't look you'll miss it. The tacos are little and only $2 each. 3 filled me up but start there. Spicy sauces for the chips were hot and delish. Friendly staff and a great spot to chill. I suggested selling the Grilled Corn on the Cob with What I believe to be Queso Fresco on them. Great cost wise and people love them. I recommend this place for those Taco munchies.... you won't be sorry...... Sorry pics next time."}
{"text":"Best tacos around the area! There tacos and burritos are to die for. My mouth is watering just writing this review.. Reasonable price as well. Come check them out!"}
{"text":"Tacos were great...for what they had available.    This what was on the menu:  Carne Asada, Carnitas, Adobada, Buche, Cabeza, Lengua, Pollo, Cameron, Suadero.  Great selection, right?  Well, this is what was available:  Asada, Carnitas, Pollo, Cabeza.  So everything I was craving wasn't there.  I opted for 1 each of what they did have and had a decent meal anyway.  Oh yeah, they were also out of fountain sodas (despite the big soda machine staring me in the face) so I was limited to their can options.    Good food, large menu of false hopes."}
