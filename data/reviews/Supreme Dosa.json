{"text":"Nice change and the food is very flavourful. Nice staff and my favourite has got to be the Chilli Dosa. My first time trying this style of cuisine and it is a winner. While waiting for my order I had Ginger tea, it was delicious. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We agreed to take mum out for an early Mother's Day meal. They had a vegetarian buffet going on.  It was a match made in heaven.  None of us missed the meat at all.  From the lentil vadai ( heavenly textured savoury snack ), to the potato and spinach dish, the sambar with drumsticks and tomatoes, all of it was heavenly.  The highlight was the assortment of smaller dosas, from the potato Marsala, to plain, to onion, we enjoyed it all.  Surprisingly, the favourite was the cheese dosa- perfectly balanced, just the right amount of cheese.  I can't wait to go back to try their non vegetarian buffet or order a la carte.  I love the southern Indian specialities they offer- different from the usual butter chicken. It's spicier and more exciting and we are lucky to have them.  They also offer for sale dosa batter and they also do catering. I hope they are here to stay."}

{"text":"We just finished a wonderful meal at Supreme Dosa. The food was well prepared nicely spiced and thoughtfully presented. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and amazing food! Best Indian restaurant in the city. More value for your money and better Indian food than the Himalayan Restaurant. 
Go for their non-veg buffets on Sunday's between 12 to 3pm. It's just $15 per person, the restaurant is a bit of a hole in the wall but the food makes up for it big time!"}
