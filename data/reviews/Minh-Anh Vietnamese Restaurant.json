{"text":"Don't let my 3-star fool you, it's a very decent restaurant with great flavors.  My only gripe is that they've watered down a lot of the menu to suit western palettes - so I can't recommend this place to my hard-core Vietnamese friends who are expecting things like herbs (various mints and basils) with their dishes.

I do really like their egg rolls, bun thit nuong and pho - in general very fresh and good flavors - but on the higher priced side especially if you travel to big Vietnamese cities throughout the US and are expecting slightly lower prices for various entrees.

An ok Vietnamese restaurant for the Cleveland area, just wished they still had real Vietnamese herbs/condiments for the dishes - or created dishes like I know the cook is probably eating at home with her Vietnamese family."}
{"text":"I always come back for the number 22 PHO and a side of egg roll, delicious!  Service can take a while but it's  as expected when there's a lot of customers."}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and seriously, this place has the BEST pho in Cleveland. The broth is very flavorful and just super delicious! The noodles have the right correct context but they should be more flour-based. The beef and beef-balls are all cooked right. Overall, Pho at Minh Anh brings me home (mentally) :)

However, the spring rolls here are my disappointment. They should have pork belly and more type of herbs/vegetable in the rolls as supposed. The peanut sauce should not be that dense as well. 
Bottom line, if you want authentic Vietnamese pho, you must come to MINH ANH!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever. EVER!! Ive been living away from Cleveland for over 5 years and when I come back, visiting Minh Anh is just as important as seeing my family. 

Its not known for ambiance, but who cares- come here for the delicious food. Its simply a bonus that its cheap. 

I DREAM ABOUT THE WON TON SOUP. I know that's not something one would really think as a stand out item at a Vietnamese place, but try it and you'll understand. Ive tried many other items but the won ton soup is what keeps me coming back. 

There's this one little old lady waitress with the tiniest voice who is so cute and sweet, I think I want her to give me away at my wedding. Sorry dad (its cool, he'll understand. He loves this place too.)

I love you Minh Anh. Don't ever change."}
{"text":"Horrible service,the waiter tried to give us a used to go soup tub! Pad Thai noodles were all little pieces of clumps... Disappointed, was much better last time we were in there. Maybe the owner was not there today."}
{"text":"Minh-Anh is the best Vietnamese I have ever eaten. I have been coming to this place for 11 years and I have never been disappointed. They have the best egg rolls with a nice flaky crust nothing like the thick skinned wannabe egg rolls I have had in other places. I tried make some of my own, but my attempts were met with disaster.  They have consistently served great food.  I highly recommend them, great little place serving wonderful food."}
{"text":"I love this place absolutely the best Vietnamese in Cleveland! 

Cinnamon Rare Beef Pho and Grilled Pork are my favs!!

Tofu egg roll and fresh rolls are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here for the first time Saturday and plan on going back as soon as possible.  I am STILL dreaming about the vegetarian egg roll I had.  I have eaten a LOT of those in my day, and it is the BEST egg roll I have EVER had.  It was crispy, buttery,and stuffed full of good stuff..  I also had the deep fired tofu which comes with peanut satay sauce that I could just eat a soup bowl of with a spoon.  The boyfriend had the crab rangoon and said that they were pretty tasty.   He had deluxe street noodles and ate the whole bowl, wishing he hadn't as it is a large bowl.  I had the tofu with vermicelli and was I surprised.  I was expecting noodles and tofu.  I got a huge bowl of noodles, with breaded tofu strips, pickled carrots and  cabbage, cucumber, bean sprouts, onions (yuck) and their garnish of spicy peanuts and tiny fried onions (think French's only fresher and better.  Yes, I am a paradox, deal with it.) 

I had a coconut soda, which is the Goya brand you can find the grocery, and the boyfriend had a Sprite.  Both were severed in their containers, which did not detract from our experience, but gave it charm.  The place is a little dim, and small, so if you are planing more than 4, call ahead for reservations.   Plenty of vegetarian dishes along with enough to keep any meat eater happy.   The only draw back is that the menu is not as descriptive as I am used to, but I can learn to ask questions."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for more years I can count, and the quality and consistency remains the same. Only the prices have gone up, but that's totally to be expected over such a long span.
Without question, the best egg rolls in Cleveland, they are super crispy, crunchy and loaded with delicious, garlicky goodness, and are only made better by a dousing of their sweet, tangy fish saucy condiment. I tell myself every time I go in there that I'm gonna skip the egg roll this time, and yet once I sit down, the first thing out of my mouth is \"I'll have an egg roll, please\".
Some of my favorite entrees include the pho soup (especially in the cold season), chicken ginger, chicken lemongrass, the deluxe pad thai and the vietnamese crepe.
Unlike many other vietnamese crepes I've tried, this one is not at all greasy, and has the wonderful flavor of coconut milk and rice flour, which gives this crispy edged thin crepe a truly unique flavor. It's stuffed with chicken, shrimp, an array of mushrooms  and topped off with julienned carrots, cucumbers,  pickled daikon and sprouts. This, too, deserves a healthy splash of the fish sauce, and a squirt or two of sriracha.
Don't expect a fancy interior. It's your typical asian restaurant vibe, complete with the obligatory fish tank. But what Minh-Anh lacks in style, it certainly makes up for in taste. Typing this up just made me hungry. I think I'll go there tonight...and this time I'll skip that egg roll for sure."}
{"text":"Best rare beef cinnamon pho, super good egg rolls with vermicelli, awesome coconut beef and lovely Ca Phe Sua da! Love love this cuisine!"}
{"text":"Szechwan is not hot and they're menu doesn't tell you that you have to request they make it hot. Nor do they when you order. Worst Szechuan I've ever had."}
{"text":"When I ask Cleveland friends or relatives where to get some good Vietnamese food, I don't get a verbal answer.  Instead, the pupils dilate.  The head tilts awkwardly while the mouth grimaces in pain.  A reply is simply not coming, but the message is clear:  \"Why would anyone want to eat Vietnamese food?\"

So I was on a solo expedition - not unlike Moses Cleaveland himself - when I landed at the Minh Anh Restaurant not far from the Whiskey Island encampment where the first Cleaveland settlers partied back in the day.

Minh Anh is pleasantly inviting among a couple other well-maintained Vietnamese establishments in this Little (very little!) Saigon area along Detroit Avenue on Cleveland's near west side.  And as it turns out, this family-run establishment has been going strong since the mid-80s.  Physically, Minh Anh is pretty standard: koi aquarium to greet you at the front door, booths along both walls, a few tables in the middle, kitchen in back.  Very clean.

I was delighted when I spotted one of my favourite Vietnamese dishes - vermicelli with roasted pork.  This same dish can be had with tofu, chicken, shrimp or seafood.  Was I ever surprised when this gorgeous bowl arrived steaming with vermicelli noodles, fresh bean sprouts, vegetables, onions and chunks of pork!  A sprig of cilantro and crushed peanuts topped it off.  As you consume this dish, surprise turns to pleasure as the flavours intensify and evolve.  Later, when you get toward the bottom of the bowl pleasure gives way to ecstasy.  I'm so addicted to this dish that I haven't ordered any other in my ten visits.

I've enthusiastically spread the word about Minh Anh.  But somebody's going to get a sore neck if I keep it up because all I get is the same contorted and glassy-eyed response.  The next time I may sample the Vietnamese crepe, another one of my favourites.  But I will probably just stick to the same darn thing:  Vermicelli with Roasted Pork ($10) and a glass of house chardonnay ($3.50)."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get egg rolls to go. The decor is not overdone or stuffy. They have a fish tank with 2 goldfish in it. I feel like I am in a boat. I would come back just for the atmosphere. The server Amanda was more than accommodating. I ordered 3 fried egg rolls to go with extra sauces. She prepped my order to the T."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally! I have been looking for you a long time and now I found you!
Who? A party in my mouth that combine authentic flavor and freshness.  So many time I have been disappointed with authentic asian fare -either greasy, unclean (I found a wire in my rice once), overly priced and list goes on...
But I decided to try this spot with urging from one of my students and I thank you. 
I only had the veggie and tofu fried rice but I will be back!
My only gripe is that I'm an on the east side but the food gives me a reason to explore.
It's actually 4.5 stars with potential for 5;)."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the food is good. We have the pho,spring roll and the crepes. all are good the pho is as good as Superior pho."}
{"text":"First of all, the lady who works there is adorable and sweet! Secondly, my pho was delicious! The only thing i wasn't a fan of was that they automatically put the basil in the soup. I love the flavor the basil gives, but hate physically eating the basil. Oh, and no bubble tea, boo! Other than that, it was very delicious pho!

*after trying some other pho places, this is my favorite place in CLE. The broth is the best here & I like that the noodles are thicker than other places!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come once a week. I've had Pho everywhere in the US from here to California .. one of my fave !"}
{"text":"I was not crazy about my pho here.  The broth had a lot of cinnamon or sugar or something that I didn't like.  I also ordered a drink that the server never brought.  The restaurant atmosphere was ok."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Loved the spring rolls and vegetarian stir fry. So much food, I've got another full meal!"}
{"text":"Wow -- wonderful food, nice ambiance. The little containers of fish sauce are absolutely sinfully good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in CLE! Try an egg roll for sure. Also tasty are the crepes, chicken curry and chow mean, and the house favorite vermicelli bowls. I love ordering just soup (the pho or chicken noodle) and an egg roll for my meal - a small soup is pretty big and suffices as dinner. Love love love Minh Anh!"}
{"text":"Best tofu pad Thai in Cleveland. House made peanut sauce is the real deal, not just a generic sauce with a peanut flavor. Takeout is fast and tastes fresh."}
{"text":"This place has great food for a good price. My favorite dish is the vermicelli with tofu. It's a medley of flavors and it's a large portion. My husband enjoys beef vermicelli - loaded with meat. 

His was $10.50- and he finished his. He was stuffed. Mine (I think) was $9 and I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. We also had a lovely pot of ginseng tea. 

The wait staff tries, but you must be willing to overlook their slowness. Also, overlook the decor and the curb appeal. Once you are eating their food, nothing else matters, which is why this place gets five stars in our book."}
{"text":"My son and I visit this fantastic little place once a week. The pho is remarkable. The broth is the best in cleveland,hands down. We get the #22. It has rare beef,beef balls and brisket. Rice noodles are made fresh also and are fabulous. The egg rolls are to die for and come with a excellent sweet  fish sauce for dipping. If you enjoy curry, the chicken or beef curry with vermicelli noodles is smooth and rich and out of bounds! The lotus root salad on the appetizer list is remarkably fresh,light and crunchy . Try it you will not be disappointed. If you like chow mein the noodles are homemade and this dish is simply huge and flavorful . The service is usually great but on weekends at peak time it gets a little slow. But trust me the food makes up for it. Be patient. and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten the yellow tofu curry, and it's amazing. I'm sure there are other vegan options, but this is my go-to. It's packed with vegetables and tofu, not too spicy, and easily makes 3 meals even if you're hungry. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  This restaurant is clean, the service was good, and the food was awesome.  We had the shrimp spring roll and the tofu spring roll.  The peanut sauce is outstanding!!  We shared a small bowl of Pho Saigon, the pork vermicelli, and the deluxe chow mein.  The Pho was exceptionally good and the other two dishes both had wonderful flavor.  The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamnese a lot. I have tried every Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland and I have to say here has the best pho. My second favorite pho place is superior pho.  (Superior pho has best Vietnamese sandwich, grilled pork salad, rice paper wraps in Cleveland )
The reason I love Minh-Anh pho is their broth which was the key of the pho are really favorable. Either chicken, seafood or beef are all great. Also the clear rice noodles are so tasty not overcooked. However I don't really big fan of their egg noodles. Moreover,  I enjoy one of their home made sauce hot oil sauce which is their secret sauce. It  could be dipped with the meat or poured into the soup. It is soooooooooo good.  #16 and 22 are our favorite two. 
Their egg roll is strongly recommended appetite. It is so fresh, crispy and unbelievable tasty. 
The food price are reasonable here and service is nice. That is why we can't help going back almost once every week."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in all of cleveland. A true hidden gem. The food is simply amazing, the service is top notch. If I could eat here daily, I would be happy. Never had a bad meal here. Or even an average meal. This is truely, one of the best places to eat in the entire city."}
{"text":"Behind a non-descript storefront along a non-descript stretch of Detroit Ave near 51st Street on the Westside, there is a kitchen full of magic. Or magical people. Quite possibly, both. There's no other way really to explain the profoundly delicious Vietnamese offerings it produces.

There's a lot on the menu, but get the pho. Get it on your first visit, and accept that it may simply and immediately render the rest of the menu invisible to you forevermore. Quell your disbelief over my melodramatic review and order the pho. Decide for yourself, though by the simple act of ordering it, you have already committed to a serious, long-term, deep and lasting relationship with Minh-Anh and their pho. It's sacred. It's wild. If it were a woman, it would be Dita von Tease.

Life is short. Get the pho.

(If this place were fancy, it would earn 5 stars anywhere. But if it were fancy, it wouldn't be as magical. Go soon. Go now. And get the pho.)"}
{"text":"This place is always busy every time I go for dinner so there's a little waiting involved. Food is amazing tho! You can't go wrong  with anything you pick off the menu! My favorite  is the fresh spring rolls and the pho!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  We sampled the crab rangoon, shredded pork with coconut sauce over wide egg noodles (banh tam bi), vegetarian egg roll with vermicelli (bun cha gio chay), and some kind of beef stir fry that I can't find on the menu.  Overall the food was good - large portions, fresh ingredients, etc.  I didn't particularly care for the pork with coconut sauce, mostly because it was sloppy and difficult to eat, but you have to expect to not always like what you order when you always order things you've never had.  The bathroom was clean, which I always appreciate, and they have easy parking in a lot next door.   I would gladly come again."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and had my first Pho experience. And it was absolutely delicious. I started off with the shrimp spring roll, which was super filling and flavorful on its own. I got it with some sweet & sour sauce, which was different than the usual sweet & sour that I am accustomed to, but it was still good. I then ordered the beef pho with rice noodles, and it was so good. The broth was so flavorful. Super affordable as well. I do not have any other Pho experiences to compare this one to, but they have set the bar pretty high. I took my leftovers home to my boyfriend, and he said he didn't find it as good. It must not be good reheated - I told him that we had to go back and experience it in person. 

Sidenote: There is a small parking lot right next to the building, so  you don't have to worry about street parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland!

I love the small mom and pop shop feel of the restaurant. You don't need a fancy place to make good food...heck amazing food! I absolutely love their Spring Rolls. They come in at $3.25 a piece but they are larger than most other places offer them and they each bite is worth it! I usually opt for the Vermicelli Noodles while my boyfriend orders Pho. I ordered the Grilled Pork Vermicelli and boy oh boy was the Pork just absolutely perfect! My boyfriend ordered the #22-Cinnamon Rare & Well Done Beef & Beef Balls with Rice Noodles after looking at other yelpers photos- he was sold!

I know that Superior Pho is favored in Cleveland but if you haven't been here you need to check it out! I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday lunch with my grandson, who is a vegetarian and a very particular about what he eats.  We both had pho.  It was great!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Our server was attentive, and overall we had a great lunch together.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very good place for authentic vietnamese food.  Quiet atmosphere, relaxing.  Great pho."}
{"text":"Very good Pho and best shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce ever!  Some people I know wish shredded carrots were added to the shrimp roll to give it some crunchy texture.  I agree but they are still excellent.  One person that I was with said shrimp not cleaned completely."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in Cleveland. The #20 cinnamon rare beef is my goto. It's around $8.50 & is a lot of food. Tons of flavor & is accompanied by some veggies & hot sauces you can add yourself. Ive also tried the pad Thai & that's very good as well. The service is hit or miss. One of the servers is great & she will even remember customers past orders. But the other servers aren't so friendly. I will be back..."}
{"text":"This week my daughter blessed me with my first nasty cold of the season. So, as is tradition with me, I sought out the best medicine I know: a hot bowl of pho. I chose Minh Anh solely as the closest place and I was very happy with that decision. Minh Anh is on Detroit Road just east of Gordon Square. parking is on the street, but on a Thursday around 1 pm I was able to park right near the door. In a small unassuming storefront, the restaurant seats maybe 25 people. it was mostly full, with one open table and two more having just been vacated. Staff was fairly busy with carryout orders (there were 4 orders waiting and several people also waiting) so the tables remained uncleared for awhile and I waited at least five minutes to be acknowledged. I was seated at a two-top by the window and ordered pho with cinnamon rare beef and beef balls, and also a pot of ginseng tea. The pho was $7.95 and the tea was $2.00. The pho was terrific. The broth was perfect, savory with hints of spice and a tiny bit of heat. Generous house made rice noodles and a good serving of rare beef and beef balls. The tea was amazing; it almost outshined the soup. The soup was served with a bowl of bean sprouts, a serving of chili paste and jalapeño slices with lime sections for squeezing. In the past I have had pho where the hot broth and noodles were served with the beef balls in the soup but the raw thin-sliced beef, basil stems, jalapeños, lime, and sprouts were all on the side. I think I prefer that, but I can't say anything bad about the flavor, ingredients or presentation of this pho. The service was also very good despite how busy the restaurant was, and the menu features many other great options beyond pho. Recommended, for sure...or even prescribed. My cold is much better. Total with tax for pho and tea, just over $11 - less than a co-pay and prescription and probably more effective."}
{"text":"Great pho! I've tried pho from various places in Cleveland (Superior Pho, number 1 pho) and this is hands down the best. Their broth has the most flavor & their noodles are always fresh & cooked properly. Their tofu is also excellent- only downside is they don't give much meat in the pho."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I came here with a friend to get some dinner on a Friday evening. The place was not too full, but the waiter seemed to be confused about whether our order had been taken... so we had to wait awhile before the staff got their act together and took our order. But once we ordered we got our food pretty fast. I got a spring roll with shrimp, the fried shrimp appetizer, and the fish cake vermicelli. Lots of seafood I know, but I'm Catholic and it was a Friday during Lent. Anyway, The apps were delicious, and my entree was super good. The fish cake was a little salty but that is to be expected. The veggies in my vermicelli were very fresh. The portion was HUGE! I usually eat a lot, but I could finish probably half of my portion of vermicelli. I think it was a great value for the price. I will definately come back in the future."}
{"text":"One of the few Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland's west side. On the north side of Detroit Avenue at West 54th Street,
It's just a few blocks from the heart of Gordon Square. It a simple restaurant and I'm glad it's has stuck around. 

Pho (#20 large) is my standard order; during the long, cold winters I will usually stop by 2-4 times a month to order it. The broth is a little sweeter than what I've had elsewhere but that's not a knock-- the flavors are phenomenal. 

Other good items are the shrimp spring roll, which is served with an absolutely delicious peanut sauce; the perfectly crispy egg roll (give it a few minutes to cool down lest you burn your mouth), and; the vermicelli. I have not been thrilled with some other dishes I have tried. The curry I found to be school cafeteria quality. 

Service is meh. They have one good server; most of the others are impersonal and stand-offish. 

If you're looking for casual spot to get a warm, filling bowl of delicious pho on a cold day, Minh Anh is your place."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food! I love the Vermicelli with chicken and pork. the only thing that is missing is an additional cup of the great broth to add to the noodles."}
{"text":"My first review *high five*

This was my first time trying Vietnamese food.  I saw all the positive reviews on Yelp and decided to check this place out today.  I am always happy to support local businesses in the neighborhood I grew up in.

Appearance: Very simply decorated and very clean.  

Food:  I already knew what I wanted from reading their extensive menu on their website.  I ordered the Tofu Spring Roll and the Vegetarian Crepe.
My spring roll came out promptly and was served with a side of peanut sauce.  The roll was a good size, filled with vermicelli noodles, big chunks of fried tofu and veggies.  It tasted very fresh and light.  The peanut sauce was very yummy.  I even manged to dribble a little on my chin because I was trying to get as much sauce on my roll as possible to shove in my face.  Cute.
My veggie crepe came out just a few minutes after I finished my roll.  The crepe was big and served with a side of raw onion, cucumber and lettuce (I think it was lettuce, maybe cabbage).  The crepe itself was like a very thin, crispy omelet.  It was piping hot and filled with a ton of bean sprouts, mushrooms and fried tofu.  I only finished a little over half of it.  It was very tasty.  My only criticism is that it was a bit bland.  There was no spice or sauce.  I love spicy food but I do appreciate the simplicity of the minimal ingredients used in this dish.  It just tasted very clean.  And they certainly didn't skimp on the fried tofu, which made me very happy.  There was a clear sauce on the table with chili seeds (I think) in it that I drizzled on my crepe but it didn't really taste like anything to me.  

Service:  My waitress said maybe 5 words to me the whole time I was there.  Not sure if she didn't speak much English or was just a woman of few words.  She was very nice though.  She filled my water twice, so I never had to ask and she brought my check to me promptly.  I have no complaints about the service.  I was in and out in under a half hour and that was fine with me :)

Value:  My bill was $14 (not including tip).  I little pricey, I think, for  basically vegetables and tofu.

I would definitely go back and bring a friend next time.  I would try a spicier dish though.  I liked that I left feeling good, not like a stuffed zombie that wants to take a nap, which is not uncommon whenever I go out to eat."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Pho so yelped this and was satisfied.  Noodles were a bit undercooked, but overall broth was decent, restaurant was clean and quiet.  I had ordered the large Pho but it was soo big I had to bring some home for left overs."}
{"text":"We've been searching for a good Vietnamese since we've moved back to northeast Ohio and I do believe we have found it here. I've had the Vietnamese Pad Thai and also the Pho.  Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"I know a lot about Vietnamese food.  Almost married a Viet girl once. Little Saigon was one of my stomping grounds.  This is as close to the real thing as CLEvage will ever get.  Try the shrimp spring rolls and pho.  Their non Viet dishes are pretty damn good too.  I'll give this place 5 stars since it's Cleveland.  I wish the bun had shrimp, chicken, pork, and beef like it did in Little Saigon.  But I suppose that's asking too much for this area.   So grab a Tsingtao and kick back."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here at least once a month. We come here for the Pho. The Pho is some of the best we have tried. Today we tried the Deluxe Pad Thai, simply amazing. Can not recommend this place enough to our family and friends. Place is always clean.  Staff is very friendly. Food is served in a nice timely manner. This is the place to come warm up with some Pho. Prices are decent. Love this place.  One of our favorites!!"}
{"text":"best pho for sure and i really enjoy the shrimp spring rolls with the peanut sauce.  the soup and the rolls are huge so i wouldnt recomment ordering both at the same time.  i love that i can drive here on my lunch break and bring it back to my desk and make the co workers jealous.  they are always asking what i'm eating."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho, Get the #19 Seafood and Chicken Pho... Garlicy and suuuchh good broth. may not even need sirachi or hoisin sauce! 

Cha Goi  was amazing 
Gui Cuon was reallllyyyyy good  too"}
{"text":"Best Asian food we have had in Cleveland. Had pho, vermicelli, and pad Thai. Better pad Thai than I've had at Thai restaurants here. Place has been packed both times we've gone.  Service is fast and friendly.  Making it our after church restaurant of choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The Pad Thai is divine and filled with colorful veggies and wonderfully flavorful. Their vermicelli bowls are fresh and good. Shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce are divine. I've never had something here that wasn't good."}
{"text":"Per Jim's review & my strong desire for good Pho I took my date to dinner to Minh-Anh, which, conveniently is RIGHT DOWN THE STREET from his house! (Yay! I can hint for freakin' good takeout more often!) 

I was not disappointed. (Thank you Jim, keep up the good reviewing.) 

Dive. Yes. Clean. Yes. Great food! Heck Yeah! Great service. Amanda rocked it out! 

Notes: 
Tea - when requesting tea, make sure you specified sweetened or un. 
Spring Rolls - YUMMY PEANUT SAUCE!!! It's large enough for 2 if you're not starving. Just cut that puppy in half. 
Pho - what can I say? Sighs of delight. A girl who lived down the street from \"Little Vietnam\" in Chi-town loves Minh-Anh's Pho, so it must be tasty. 
Lo-Main - (the date's choice) was beautiful and full of bright coloured vegetables that were cooked to perfection. Not soggy, not too raw. Simply yum. 

Will we be going back? YES! And so should you!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such great ratings. I've come here twice now and I've been disappointed both times. I grew up eating only the most legit of legit Vietnamese food. As a result, I'm super picky about where I get my Vietnamese food.

The pho broth is WAY too sweet; I actually had zero desire to drink the soup. And purple onions should not be used. The noodles are too thick (this is actually the first place I've ever seen that uses such thick noodles. They almost looked like hu tieu noodles). Their small size was actually really small compared to the standard \"small/regular\" size in the US; I was actually still kind of hungry after. I've also had their banh xeo, which came with an absurd amount of bean sprouts, and wasn't very crispy. Boo, hiss.

The prices are also absurdly high for what you get. Bun (vermicelli) dishes should not be more than $8, while this place charges $10+, and banh xeo dishes should be no more than $7, while this place charges $11+. Speaking of prices, extra 50c charge for credit card purchases under $10.

But there is ample free parking about 20 feet from the restaurant. And if you cross the parking lot, there's a little Vietnamese grocery store that's rather adorable."}
{"text":"Great pho place. Owners are friendly and the food is great quality. Third generation family owned."}
{"text":"Probably the most Authentic tasting Pho in Cleveland. East and West.  The broth is savory, and has that great taste of buttery cinnamon that most Cleveland Pho restaurants lack.  I prefer this place to any Pho spot downtown."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Vietnamese restaurant out on Detroit. Came here during Weapons of Mass Creation fest. They accommodated our rushed to-go order before one of the designer presentations!

I had the bun with fish cakes. It was really good! I definitely enjoyed all the flavors, and they were very generous with the fish cake portions. 

The interior decor is very 70s-diner-hole-in-the-wall. Despite this, it's a great place to grab some quite Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"We still love this place!  This has been our favorite Vietnamese restaurant for a while, and it is a real treat to go here once every couple of months when we're in town for work. 

We eat a LOT of Vietnamese food at restaurants, I make it at home and I have fond memories of my childhood neighbors' cooking for my family, yet every bite of Vietnamese food we eat at other restaurants gets compared to the dishes at Minh Anh. 

Throughout the years favorites here include their stellar cinnamon-y pho with high quality rare beef, the grilled pork vermicelli dish, crispy tofu springrolls and the fresh shrimp summer rolls. 

I typically order a big bowl of the vegetarian style vermicelli with fried tofu, lemongrass and crispy tofu springrolls. Erin likes to order grilled pork vermicelli or beef chow mein. Another great dish is the coconut beef stirfry. It has tender beef and crisp veggies tossed in a creamy coconut lemongrass sauce and is served with white rice. 

If I lived closer I would venture out further in the menu and try something new more often. There are so many items that sound delicious,  however we find ourselves ordering the same staple each time simply because we crave it."}
{"text":"This place has VERY good pho. It's the best I've had in Cleveland, and is actually in my top 5 of all time. The broth was very savory and delicious, and the extras (meat, noodles, thai basil, etc) were all very fresh and tasty as well. 

I was a bit disappointed that they did not include any of the typical animal parts that you'd expect in a bowl of pho, such as tendon, tripe, and fatty flank. If you are reading this, Minh-Anh, PLEASE include these delicious pho staples on your menu in the future!

The service was quick, and the restaurant was clean. This is now my \"go-to\" pho spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Worth repeat visits!

THE UP-SIDE:
Fanstastic Vietnamese food in a very clean, pleasant and quiet type atmosphere.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:
For once, I cannot think of one!

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Great place for a relaxing dinner with friends or on a first date.  For added fun, yell out the name of the restaurant in an agitated manner; acting all Vietnamese with yourself.  ...good stuff."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, my parents have been coming here since the beginning of time, n now I still come for take out for my elderly mother. She loves the food, the soup, n the memories of eating here with my dad.  Great place with great food."}
{"text":"This place is great!! 

Now, I've only had rice noodle soup (at times with shrimp) and the veggie egg roll...so maybe I should be more conservative with my exclamation points, but it is just so dependable, affordable, and friendly up in there! They never miss a beat. And I have been many times now for that same dish (I really should venture into other areas of their menu).

I also happen to love that my bill holder today had \"gracias\" on it with mostly rubbed off black marker over it. It shows that the are truly focused on the food, ya know? ;-)"}
{"text":"1st stop with my Uncle after a long day of sailing on Lake Erie. 2nd stop with my sister for a late dinner. 3rd stop will definitely be coming soon as I told a friend I wanted to take her. 

Good food everytime. I love ordering my noodle dishes spicy because Vietnamese spicy is not like any other spicy. When you say spicy and they say, \"You sure?\", there's a reason for it. MMmmm.

I really enjoy the atmosphere also. Quaint and small. Large fish tank to block the not-so-inviting street view. Right next door to an asian-market...which they may own (I'm not sure as I haven't asked nor have I researched it). 

Service is alright. Go for the food."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. They stop seating people at 10:15p if you're looking to dine in; however, they'll still allow for take out orders. The service can be hit or miss, there are a few servers who are real friendly and make good suggestions and a few servers who can come off somewhat brash. 

Either way the food is totally worth it !! :) 

I eat here religiously. So yummy. Totally recommend the egg rolls and chicken fried rice. (And hot oil!!)"}
{"text":"Walking in and hearing a voice from the right corner say \"Sit anywhere you like\" nice gesture, but it would have been nice to invite us in... First time eating here and I was excited. We arrived back into town from visiting Toronto Canada for the first time, so my husband and I were craving for some delicious noodle broth... The ambience was Meh and had no music playing. So on a dead day you and your food will have a bonding experience like no other! We are happy that we came here because the broth was probably the best I have ever had without even adding all the fixings yet. My God, I am from California and we have a galore of Pho shops littering the town. We had lots of options to choose from and this Broth beats all the Pho shops in CALI. Sometimes asian restaurants are dependent when adding MSG to make things taste better. I was definitely trying to avoid that. I was in Pho Heaven!! Coming back for more and making my Husband get his own bowl!!"}
{"text":"Why is pad thai so delicious? My guess is so it is craved by me. Luckily when I have a craving it can be answered by Minh-Anh. I've had pad thai from a million different places and have never seen one bright red Like they do it here. And it wasn't just their pad thai that was great, everyone at the table had something equally amazing. I need to go back for the curry noodles. My friend who ordered it is lucky I didn't accidentally take her leftovers box of fragrant yumminess ."}
{"text":"We are completely addicted to asian food. This is  a small, outta the way spot, but the food is very good. The crepe is insanely good! One of the best I've ever had. The sauces and broths are especially good. I found them to be more flavorful than other Asian places. The service is standout! Our server even helped with the  pronunciation of Vietnamese dishes!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the outside, this place is an absolute gem for Asian food. We ordered the Deluxe Pad Thai, Egg Roll, Spring Roll, and Pork Vermicelli. Both entrees were amazingly fresh and colorful. The pad Thai wasn't spicy which I typically prefer but the flavors were so subtle and clear that I fell in love with it. What really amazed me was that the egg roll actually tasted fresh and good. Most egg rolls taste just average or like they were bought wholesale but this really had a fantastic unique flavor that was just awesome. 

Don't expect super attentive service, and you will be satisfied. Go inside, seat yourself, and be happy with getting awesome tasting food."}
{"text":"For lunch here we had a Shrimp Spring Roll with peanut sauce, Deluxe Fried Rice with shrimp, chicken & pork, and Pho. All were excellent. We saw no Asians eating or working here which is a bit disturbing, but the food was, nevertheless, quite good. The ambiance & service was fair.

This place is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Authentic food and  friendly staff. Menu options are plentiful and prices are reasonable. I ordered their pho #21 and it would be the best option to go with if you're looking for a classic bowl of some really good pho. 

Located in Gordon Square, it's a local place not hard to miss. A market is also next door so you can pick up some groceries. Parking is located in the back and well lit area. Inside of the place is not that big. I'd consider it a family run business because the tables are kind of out-dated but the food there is worth it. 

I'd come again to eat their egg rolls which is also another delight."}
{"text":"Best all around Asian takeout/dine in place on the near west side in my opinion. Love the Pho and other offerings. Always get prompt, friendly service and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Been coming here since 1986. Great flavors. Always consistent. Love all the soups. Love the crepe."}
{"text":"Get the Chicken vermicelli bowl but ask for it over white rice instead! Pro tip: make it spicy. It's really good and a huge portion. The chicken was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. It comes with fried eggs, julienned cucumber, house made do chua (pickled carrot and daikon), shredded lettuce and crushed peanut. To make it spicy they bring you a side of house made chili sauce. Use a little of the nuoc cham ( sauce in the glass bottle) over your lettuce and mix it in with everything else after you've taken a few bites and as you eat. I've eaten a few things off of their menu and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"#1 Vietnamese in CLE.

Portion sizes are out of control-- in a good way! Menu can be a little intimidating since most don't know much Vietnamese... but just try something new every time and I am sure you'll find something you like. 

Tofu with Ginger: very good, very gingery.
Tofu with Lemon Grass, Tofu with Coconut milk, or Veg Curry are safe and good bets to go with the first couple times until you are brave enough to try something you don't know what the heck it is, or find your own favorite dish.

Get this appetizer: Tofu-Spring Rolls. To-die-for,  no kidding. 

They are good for carry-out too!

Secret find- check out the vegetables and plants they have growing in the back. For some reason, its really impressive to me and I love looking every time I go! I really hope they use them in their dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is Bún tht nng and they crushed it. So goood! There's also a Vietnamese market next door with Vietnamese and Thai groceries."}
{"text":"The service here is consistently awful, but the pho is pretty delicious, which keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"this place is super yummy!
i've gotten their vegetarian pad thai, curry tofu, tofu and mushrooms, and vegetable tofu chow mein. oh and the tofu spring roll! all delicious! the noodles are appropriately greasy, the vegetables are fresh, and the tofu is fried just right.
the decor is your usual asian style.
be sure to check out the vietnamese market right next door! they've got all the usual goodies and their vegetables look pretty fresh too."}
{"text":"Service very slow. 
Pho: meat amount is negligible. Broth is so sweet that after the meal your tongue feels coated with sugar. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know enough about Vietnamese food to know whether or not this place is authentic...but it sure is good!  The cinnamon soups (with or without beef) are delicious, and try the spring rolls over noodles.  Cheap, very, very tasty, and you won't leave hungry.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"I will be honest and say that before today, I had never tasted Vietnamese food (I heard you gasp....calm down skippy) But, all I can say is....YUMMO. Loved the chicken and shrimp pho broth bowl. IT WAS FRIGGIN HUGE DUDE! It could use more meat though for sure....kinda skimpy in that department. I also had their deluxe fried rice. The plate was PACKED TO THE GILLS. So much flavor, yet so very simple. Service here was slow and kinda hum drum. Not horrible, so I cannot complain too much. Reasonably priced as well. WIN WIN. Seriously though, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Beef fried rice is the best fried rice I've ever had. Pho broth is slightly sweeter than others in a good way."}
{"text":"I love this place! My parents have been taking me here since I was 5 months old and I just absolutely love it. The vegetarian spring rolls are absolutely phenomenal and the vermicelli is to die for. Plus the service has always been excellent and very friendly. This is by far Cleveland's best kept secret BEST VIETNAMESE IN CLEVELAND."}
{"text":"Tried their Cm tm. It was very good, fresh greens, pickled carrots and daikon. The one component that would have taken it over the top would be a grilled shrimp component. 
The service was a bit slow so if you're in a rush, this is probably not the place to sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! 



I went here a couple time but one time I found some flies eggs on a piece of cucumber (on a pork rice dish). Could you say NASTY? I showed it to the waitress and she brought it to the kitchen. A lady (I think she's the owner) came storming out of the kitchen and ask me \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Show me\". She had the rice dish on her hands but they replaced the cucumber already. I was fuming mad but I had my 2 year old with me and that was my only day off so I didn't want to make a scene. I just went to pay and left (I still tipped the waitress, not her fault). The food was mediocre but sanitation is a problem with this restaurant. You can see it if you look around."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I love pho and the reviews are great. I was not impressed with the pho at all though. I thought the veggies were not fresh (especially the bean sprouts were looking browned on the edges and soggy) as they should be. Could have just been an off day so I would try it again sometime. My husband had a ginger chicken dish and it was very average."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in town.  It is reasonably priced and the food is very good.  I tend to prefer Long Phung, which is in the same neighborhood, has similar quality of food but a much larger menu with more selection, and has a larger seating area.  Still, for variety, this one is certainly worth going to.  It has slightly different offerings and a different style, and I think some items are slightly better here.

The attached market, however, is a huge plus.  The market is small but has a lot of stuff in it, including fresh veggies that are hard to obtain outside of Cleveland's chinatown.  If you live nearby this place can be very handy.

There is a small parking lot around the back; the driveway is easy to miss."}
{"text":"hands down this remains our favorite  asian food spot in Cleveland.  we went last night after I heard there was a fruit fly infestation at Cambodia Du cuisine (a friend was there for lunch).  nothing ruins my dining experience like fruit flies. 

it is always consistent here.  the food is always hot and fresh when brought to the table.  I had the shrimp rolls & pho last night.  The chow mien noodles are always fried and are delightfully crispy.  the service is great and the price is very affordable. we like the chrysanthemum tea also

I'm going to put this back on my need at least once a week list : )"}
{"text":"Probably one of my top choices for pho in CLE now--and I've only had it as takeout. That's how good it is. 

Yelper PW's review is 110% correct. This is one flavorful, salty broth that knocked my socks off. Normally I'm picky about the meat in my pho (go brisket or go home) but whatever they used was delicious. I was picking through the soup to find all the meat--which is not something I normally do. And while I didn't have far to travel with the pho, they offered to send it home with me separated--but when I told them I was going right up the street they just sent the noodles in the broth. It was still perfect. 

I also loved that 2 large to-go pho order cost me only $15. Ummm, yes. That's what I'm talking about. I could eat this basically everyday. 

I'll save that 5th star for when I try either another menu item and/or when I dine in, but even for to-go orders the service was quite nice. 

I actually can't wait to return--oh, and the free, safe parking is amazing. Yes."}
{"text":"I've had lots of Vietnamese food in different cities and Minh is truly some of the best I've ever had, on par with the stuff at little Saigon in Orange County. The noodles are all hand made which is like unprecedented in the Midwest and the menu is huge, but everything we got was incredible. Favorite things were the chicken vermicelli and the vegetable crepe. Would absolutely go again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my dad's birthday. While he was in love, everyone else was far from impressed. Everything was rather bland. I was really disappointed because I expected so much from this place based off reviews but it missed a mark for me."}
{"text":"Minh Ahn was the first Vietnamese restaurant I dined in when I moved to Cleveland over three years ago.  It remains, in my opinion the best.   Their summer rolls and spring rolls are exceptional. The vermicelli is hearty and flavorful. The pho is incredibly savory.

The Summer Rolls are so freshly made with pork and/ or shrimp. The consistency is perfect, with the rice paper still firm, but not tough, the rice noodles perfectly aldente and just enough crunch with veggies. The peanut sauce is AMAZING. It's delightfully peanuty without feeling or tasting like peanut butter. The slight saltiness from the hoisin and and dry roasted peanut garnish only enhances the flavor.  The fried rolls are thick and meaty with incredibly rich pork and veggies.  The tofu option is also satisfying.  The fish sauce dipping sauce here is equally amazing, with the right balance of savory, sweet and salty. The garlic and herbs give it a nice body and flavor.

The vermicelli bowls feature a hearty serving of room temperature, aldente rice noodles, lettuce, crisp lightly pickled veggies, fried onion straws, peanuts and your choice of protein. My personal favorite is chicken AND a fried roll. Their pork is also delicious. The meat is always beautifully seasoned and again, the portions are hearty. I always add Sriracha and their fish sauce dipping sauce.  These bowls are perfection.

The pho is obviously the quintessential Vietnamese dish and they do it right at Minh Anh.  The broth is incredibly savory with tremendous richness and just fatty enough for an incredible mouthfeel.  The noodles are aldente and the veggies super fresh, including the cilantro and basil already in the soup.  The meat is always prepared perfectly.  I love their fatty brisket and rare steak together, they balance each other in richness and add depth to the soup.

Lastly, l find the people who work here very hospitable.  Even when it's busy, and they find time to check on me and refill my drinks.  I've always had good service here.

I highly recommend this place and suggest you try a new vermicelli or pho dish if you're a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I hate to do this... But I see that people actually read my reviews and I wouldn't want to mislead anyone. 

My beloved Minh-Anh seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Something has happened and I just can't place my finger on it. Their house special hot sauce is no longer hot, the jalapeños are now mild at best, the vermicelli is routinely overcooked, and the pho has lost its depth of flavor. 

It's a shame, really, as this was one of my favorite spots for lunch or dinner with my son. I mean it's still \"good,\" and you'll still find me there from time-to-time; just not nearly as often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm even happier because it's so close to where I live.

Pros: 
- great tofu spring rolls, comes quickly and chock full of stuff, tastes very fresh
- great pho. Small bowl is definitely enough, which means it's about the right size of pho. Meats are good too.
- great pricing. The friend I went with had seen a cheaper, outdated menu, but my meal was still only about $11
- parking. Available in the back.

Cons:
- the peanut sauce requires you to put in your own hoisin sauce, unless you like it without.
- the mint leaves are already on the pho.

Also, the restaurant is clean and looks nice. Can't wait to come back! My next dish to try is the bo luc lac."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 17 years. NOTHING has changed. The food and people are just as good as ever. The place is still a hole in the wall. 

Try the clear Shrimp roll, Shrimp Lemon Grass vermicelli, Crepes, Chicken Curry.... try it all."}
{"text":"Sadly, Minh-Anh continues to disappoint.
This is my third dining experience at Minh-Anh: 1 lunch and 2 dinners.
At all three dining experiences the overall quality of the food was fair at best and definitely not
fresh for most of the ingredients.
The Rice Noodles with Chicken Pho was too sweet, the lettuce looked and tasted wilted, and the chicken was oddly processed. Not even sure where they get their chicken - it was cut as if it was Spam and did not even taste like fresh chicken cut/pulled from the bone!
The Shrimp Spring Roll was ok, but I have had way better. And the peanut sauce had a gooey/sticky texture - not appealing visually or tastewise.
And what Vietnamese restaurant doesn't offer Bahn Mi sandwiches!!! Minh-Anh does not and that makes this restaurant in my book far from an authentic Vietnamese cuisine focused restaurant.
Having lived in San Francisco for many years, I have enjoyed the delightful and tasteful cuisine of authentic Vietnamese restaurants. Luckily, Cleveland does have two great authentic Vietnamese restaurants: Pho Thang Cafe on Superior in downtown Cleveland is amazing with wonderful Bahn Mi sandwiches and Pho soups, and the smaller Pho Ha Nam in the Asia Town Center has the best Summer Rolls and peanut sauce in Cleveland. At a higher price point, Bac in Tremont is also ok, but one has to be careful when ordering from their menu to avoid too much Americanization.
For real authentic Vietnamese cooking like you would find at the famed Slanted Door and other smaller Vietnamese restaurants in gourmet foodie capital of America San Francisco, please try Pho Thang Cafe and Pho Ha Nam - and avoid Ming-Anh and even overrated Superior Pho. You won't be disappointed with Pho Thang Cafe and/or Pho Ha Nam!"}
{"text":"Minh-Anh is my favorite place for Pho in the Cleveland area, and so far the best I've tried in the country. My wife and I have ordered take-out from here 10+ times. 

In Cleveland, I've also tried Superior Pho, Ninh Kieu, and Pholicious in Southpark Mall (apparently now closed.) For me, the flavor of the broth is the best here, and what puts it over the top! My favorite is #22 Well Done & Rare Beef + Beef Balls, and my wife prefers #20 Rare Beef. 

Besides the Pho, the only other things  I've ordered here are #9 the Shrimp Spring Rolls (the peanut sauce is awesome!) and #40 the Chicken Crepe, which was also very good.

The only thing I can think of that would make this place better is, I wish they had Bubble Tea on their menu."}
{"text":"Minh-Anh Ahhhhhh. That is what it should be called.  This place is really good. This place exemplifies all things great about mom and pop establishments.

Everything is super fresh,as it should be, there is  Vietnamese market on the premise.

Egg roll is to a different level at this place. I think the human body only withstand so much fried food, this is one of those items that warrants the self abuse and self loathing of a grease fueled binge.

I think this establishment can be in the conversation of best pho's in the 216. I shared the pho with one of my close brown eyed friends.  Oh they have this chile paste/oil they doctor up that is off the hook good.  So good  would like a half body massage with it.  Split this with my friend. The broth was rich full of flavor, including a burst of cinnamon. Noodles were cooked perfectly along with a decent amount eye of round and meatballs. Limes are getting expensive,  the condiments were, jalapenos, bean sprouts, and lemons. Good stuff. 

Next, I ordered the beef lemongrass.  It was beef stir fried with onions, in a brown sauce,  served with cucumbers, sweet pickled carrots, and diakon radish(guessing). I mixed it all up slathered the chili oil an proceeded to inhale. My partner in gluttony took a healthy helping and proceeded to tell me the sauce was too thick.  Keep in mind she reminded the sauce was too thick after she started scarfing her second healthy helping.  She then said \"well maybe i should stop eating this because I'm sure you want t take it home.\"  I said \"bit*h  you know it will never make it that far\".  

So at this point my hands could barely touch the steering wheel, neither could hers. hmm were to go for desert."}
{"text":"Tried this place out again since I was in the area supporting the iLTHY opening, and it definitely was better this time around. Ordered my Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (as usual). The portions were still very large, and the lack of flavor that held it back the first time was no more. It was bursting with sweet, savory flavors, and every ingredient was fresh and delicious. The Cha Gio (rolls) were crispy and full. The pork was smoky and tender. Everything came together very well, almost to perfection.

We had the same funny and friendly waiter. The kid is a joker and a charmer. We teased him about our confusing orders of varying versions of Bun Thit Nuong, and he joked, \"If I get it wrong, it's okay, because I can eat it instead.\" Refills came by often. Great service. 

The price is still a bit steep compared to restaurants of similar quality. ~$13 for bun thit nuong cha gio. ~$11 for just the bun thit nuong.

Like I stated, there are a couple places I'd go for Viet before this one, but Minh Anh is still a place everyone should try."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey. 7.99 for lap xuong but I did manage to pick up frozen durian"}
{"text":"I came here with friends a little under the weather. Ordered the shrimp pho and it helped me feel better immediately. Their tea is so flavorful and tummy. Their entrees are consistently fully of quality ingredients! Friendly owner and staff!"}
{"text":"A little background on what brought me here - a friend from out of town wanted Pho, but we weren't going out until later in the evening.  Superior Pho closes early, and the mixed reviews I'd heard about #1 Pho weren't too appealing, so I asked a coworker.  The second I mentioned Minh-Anh she got this rabid look in her eye and started raving about the place and how she used to go there all the time when she lived on this side of town.  Long story short, she was totally right.  We started with the gigantic tofu spring rolls, which were really, really good.  My friend ended up getting the vermicelli instead of pho, but it was also delicious.  I went with the chow-mein and wasn't disappointed.  We were also impressed by the prices and the portions.  I think I paid around $11 for my dinner, ate until I was full, and didn't even make a dent in it.  Plenty of leftovers are never a bad thing, especially when it tastes this good.  It's not too fancy inside, but not a dive either.  Well worth checking out.  (The iced coffee w/condensed milk is also a nice touch!)"}
{"text":"I had the Hu Tieu Dai (seafood & chicken glass noodle). They might as well name it 1-Shrimp and Chicken Glass Noodle because there was exactly 1 shrimp in the bowl and the rest of the protein was chicken. What I had was not hu tieu my tho. If you want another shrimp, pay 1 buck extra. Wth. For 7 bucks I could get an awesome loaded bowl of hutieu, heaped with shrimp, roasted pork, liver, crunchy shrimp cake, fish cake, and a quail egg in Virginia.  But maybe I'm spoiled by the food there. Broth tasted average. I did get a taste of the Bun Thit Nuong, seems the only worthy dish in the entire menu. Marinade was good enough, but the noodle was...bleh. Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"So this place contains my Grandmother's name.  When she came over from Vietnam she opened the first Vietnamese restaurant in the area and when the restaurant closed her partner carried the name to this place.  So that's why it gets a couple of stars.  However, I think the food is just o.k.  
Over the past few years I've noticed the pho containing less and less noodles until the last time I went here and received a bowl of broth with a little meat and had to search for a large bite of noodles.  But it may have been an off night.  
The spring rolls are good and crispy and anything tastes good with lots of fish sauce on it (to me anyways) and the service is always a little bit off.
However, I can't diss the family name so this place is still alright in my book."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho on the west side. Wonderful flavors and very filling. I like to order take out every couple of months."}
{"text":"Pho was very good, had nice flavor. I would prefer they bring out the basil and jalapeños on the side with the bean sprouts and lime so you're able to add more if you like. Overall, good experience. Two stars were for the service as they aren't very friendly and seem to be understaffed"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The prices are fare and the portion sizes are huge. The serves is good but slow. They for got a few things but took them off our bill. The food came out hot and the veggies were fresh. I will go back to try more menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Nestled in a not so great neighborhood (pretty safe though), I found this place in a book called, Ethnic Eats. Plenty of parking yes, very courteous, friendly staff, interiors were clean and tidy. The menu was not very extensive, which is a good thing, the longer the menu the more substandard the fare. I ordered the crepe with chicken filling, it was huge!!
The crepe filled the entire dinner plate and was stuffed with bean-sprouts, lots of chicken and mushrooms, there was a small side of salad and delicious pickled radish and carrots. When I bit into the crepe, I realized to my delight that it was made with coconut milk. 
The best was yet to come, the server dropped off a vial of what looked like ordinary duck sauce. I uncorked it, fully expecting a viscous sweet sauce, instead it streamed out, the consistency of soy sauce and released the pungent aroma of anchovies. I'm never going back to store bought duck sauce again. Ever.
Perfect compliment to the meal was the Vietnamese hot coffee with condensed milk, although it could be improved upon by adding milk instead of the hot water.
It's a bit of a hike all the way from Highland Heights but well worth it."}
{"text":"While I've been busy consuming greasy MSG-overloaded local Chinese chains dishes, this little miraculous joint has been blossoming unnoticed by me. You come in sceptical - hole in the wall in the heart of the ghetto - and you leave reborn. Soups....Every single time I promise myself to have some more adventurous meal and here I am - jumping in my soup head first and refusing to come to the surface. So darn good. I know nothing of Vietnam, to my own shame won't find it on the map, but if they have soups like this one - I am moving. Freshly made for each customer, succulent, delicious...In Russia we say there is no second sort of freshness, always only first, in this restaurant, they don't just say it, they make it a reality. Fresh everything - herbs, meats, dumplings, sauces... This restaurant could be located in the middle of the minefield , people would still make it here to eat. So couple of tips: soups are enormous, even small ones, don't order soup and an entree, its impossible to finish; and hide all of electronics in your car under the seat. Well you probably knew that.
P.S. And also incredibly cheap!"}
{"text":"This place has the best egg rolls. I love to go here a couple times a year. They are closed on Mondays, I've shown up too many times and they were closed haha. Great food."}
{"text":"I really can't overstate how terrible the food is at this restaurant. This is especially true because you can get excellent Vietnamese food at several spots around Cleveland. This place has really poor Vietnamese and even worse \"Chinese\" dishes. Seczuan chicken seasoned with bell peppers instead of chilis?  Come on. Make the trip to midtown.  SO worth it."}
{"text":"It was okay. First time trying Vietnamese food. I ordered Vegetarian Pad Thai hot- it was bland and they forgot to make it hot so there was no kick- the red cabbage on the dish was nice and sweet with a small crunch, very good. I ordered a vegetarian egg roll- greasy and tasted like nothing (bland), but a nice crunch, a shrimp spring roll- they are cold and come wrapped in a translucent rice wrap, not bad, and a vegetarian (tofu) spring roll- same wrapping, same temperature- 0 flavor. My S.O. ordered shrimp fried rice- not bad, and shrimp fingers (fried shrimp)- he liked the rice and shrimp ok. The shrimp came with a sweet and sour sauce- it looked good with all kinds of vegetables and pineapple in it, but he said it was ok (not great). I also ordered crab Rangoon- it was okay, not sweet the way some are or savory, but bland again."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese Restaurant has \"Value\" written all over it. Tasty eggrolls to start and really big menu with all the possible Vietnamese delicacies to continue, all good and for a cheap price you can't beat! Don't expect fancy place or neighborhood, of course, but if you're fan of Vietnamese food you should absolutely try this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for pho with the new man. I got the 21, it had beef balls and cinnamon beef slices. It was very flavorful. The beef balls had chewy unknown parts so I went easy on those. They offer small and large bowls of pho, I don't like leftover pho, so I loved that I could get a small and have a chance of finishing it all."}
{"text":"I was a little sketchy on going here because as I looked online for their menu, they were very cheap. Normally you get what you paid for. As my roommate and I checked out the menu in the restaurant, their prices were doubled than their website. I ordered their summer roll with peanut sauce and it was a lot better than most vietnamese places I've been to. It tasted home made which was nice. I couldn't judge them from their appetizers only, and I couldn't let that be the deciding factor of the review.
I also ordered their beef ball pho and my roommate ordered the combination pho. The waitress came out and apologized because they ended up making 2 combos. She said I would. Not have to pay the extra since combo was about a dollar more. The soup was light so I was worried, but as I tasted it... it was amazing. Not too salty, nor was it too oily. I had a great experience :)"}
{"text":"When I have a craving for Pho I go to Minh Anh.  No ifs, and or buts.  I have had Pho at other places, but none of them compare to Minh Anh.  The ambience might not be the best, but who needs that when you have a big bowl of  delicious, earthy, flavorful Pho right in front of you.  Very affordable too."}
{"text":"Minh-Anh is as near to Mom's cooking as one can find in Cleveland..if your mom cooks Vietnamese dishes...that is! 

Everytime I go there I always order the same thing... 

Egg Roll, Pho, vermicelli, beef fried rice, and a Parfait! 

Oh how I wish I was back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I came here for dinner last night. We are both Pho fans. I visit Cleveland for work frequently and have been exploring the local Pho options - thus far I've been disappointed - not any more!

Good Pho Ga is hard to find - many places don't do it well. Many offer the soup with a beef broth - not a chicken broth - which is just sooooo wrong!

As I scanned their menu - I was disappointed to see that their was no Pho Ga. So I asked - I was a bit perplexed by the answer, but it turns out they do offer Pho Ga - but you have to ask for it! Which I did!

We also each ordered an order of the fresh Garden rolls served with a side of peanut sauce for dipping.

The rolls came out first, while they were a little on the loose side in terms of how tightly rolled they were - the rolls were fresh and tasty and peanut dipping sauce was thick, creamy and delicious! As always, I added a generous dose of the Sriracha sauce directly into the peanut sauce and stirred it in.

Then came the Pho Ga - with the accoutrements on the side: bean sprouts, lime weeds, jalapeños, and some sort of hoison-oil/paste dip. I noted there was no fresh Basil - I asked - it was already added to the Pho - I was told I could have some fresh on the side - but I could clearly see a generous quantity was already in the Pho - so I declined.

I added the sprouts and jalapeños and squeezed the lime juice into the broth and proceeded to sample. It was very good - rich and tasty, full of flavor and complexity!

I finished the entire large bowl of Pho Ga and realized I've found my go-to joint in Cleveland for Pho Ga!

I will note that I believe they put some MSG in their broth - afterward I had that overly-thirsty feeling from eating soup with MSG in it - assuming they do -  it was not an overwhelming effect and sensation... I guzzled some water and was fine!

Service was good and the folks were friendly - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably like my only favorite authentic Vietnamese restaurant, I enjoy most of their specials entrees and appetizers. Not a huge fan of the pho, but overall very good and the atmosphere isn't that bad."}
{"text":"some of the best cheap eats on the detroit shoreway.....  Noodles and pho and the best crispy egg rolls and wife loves the spring rolls as well"}
{"text":"Been a fan of this place for a long time.  So hard to get good  Pho on the westside.  I slways get tge #18 with a vegetarian eggroll. I'm not  a vegetarian,  but I prefer the meatless eggroll here."}
{"text":"The pho here tastes distinctly different from that at Superior Pho and the like.  I would say that it is sweeter and has a very significant mint flavor.  It's not bad - it's not oily or anything, and I can see how it would satisfy some people's palates.  However, the mint flavor was overwhelming for me and turned me off quite a bit.  Also, their equivalent of the pho with everything - #22, pho tai chin - only has three different types of meat, and no tripe.  The meat balls in the pho were pretty good, though.

The bun (rice vermicelli) is okay too - the noodles were slightly undercooked but the flavor was good.

The prices are comparable to pho places in Asia Town (maybe $0.50 cheaper or so).  The service is a bit sluggish.  We sat by the kitchen so I know that my pho was sitting on the counter for a good 5 minutes before the waitress picked it up and took it to our table.  

The restaurant does get some Asian clientele despite being in a Cleveland suburb, and there are lots of people taking food to go."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken vermicelli and it was delicious! the quality of the chicken was so good: it was so tender and meaty. The portion is pretty good, they give you a good amount of meat and for the price and quality, I'd definitely say it was worth it.  I ordered an egg roll based on what I read in other reviews and I certainly wasn't disappointed! It was so crispy and flavorful.  Its too bad that they don't have a Vermicelli option that has meat AND an egg roll, unless you order an additional appetizer egg roll, which at 1 egg roll for $3.25 is a little pricy. Overall, this place had quality ingredients and it shows, the price may be a little bit more expensive than some of the places on Superior, but its worth it...especially for the egg roll!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Asian food, but Minh-Anh has been one of my favorite places in Cleveland since I came to Cleveland about 5 years ago.  It's clean, inexpensive, and the staffs are friendly.  Most impotantly the food is really good. I normally srart with a tofu spring roll with peanut sauce which is awrsome probably the best I've ever had in Cleveland, and then a bowl of soup noodle. If I'm really hungry, I get vermicelli, or pork chop over rice which are both very nice and the portion is great. I loved to explore the menu here.  Lately I tried the singapore stir noodle which is curry-based and pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch based on the 4 star yelp reviews. Yelpers you did me wrong!

The service here is nothing short of sad. When I entered the restaurant there was no hostess waiting to seat me. So I stood by the cash register trying to get the attention of the employees for about 5 minutes before I finally decided to seat myself. After 10 minutes a waiter finally comes over. I'm excited by the prospect of finally getting to order some 4 star food, so I ask the waiter to recommend a dish. Guess what? He speaks no English! I'm not trying to be insensitive but when your clientele is predominantly English speaking, I think its reasonable to expect that the waiter will be able to speak English as well! So I had to wait another ten minutes for an English speaking waitress who recommended the stir fry noodles as their best, most authentic dish.

After about 7 minutes my food comes out. Kudos on the speed, but the kudos end there. This was quite possibly the NASTIEST \"Vietnamese\" food I ever had. It was a mess of grease grease and more grease. The chicken and shrimp were so overcooked that I had to take a chewing break. I was disgusted and even though I am not Vietnamese I was insulted that they would call this catastrophe Vietnamese.

Bottom line, waste of my time and poor taste buds. I will NOT be returning. The corner Chinese restaurant is better than this!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was expecting a better meal. The pho broth was good but was very disappointed with the pork over vermicelli.

I could live with not going back."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The service wasn't horrible but never felt like she gave a funk.  It was empty noon on a weekday ... Never a good sign.  Reason for poor rating was when I asked if they could make mine extra spicy I was told nope bc the chef cooking couldn't cook w spicy ingredients.... Seriously wtf... So I settle for hot sauce on the side... Which the server forgot then had to go back to get it.  Very disappointing as I love Vietnamese and spent $20 on a lunch ... I won't return.  The spring rolls were really good so I'll end with a positive."}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese food! Ordered the vermicelli noodles with pork and added a fried egg roll to go on top. Delicious and inexpensive dinner! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this little family-owned spot  for years, so I was surprised I hadn't reviewed it yet. It's not the cleanest or fanciest place, but the people are great, particularly the little old ladies doing the cooking. The Vietnamese dishes here are pretty uniformly delicious. They offer some mediocre Chinese and Thai choices, but if you stick to the Vietnamese wheelhouse you're likely to be happy."}
{"text":"loved the Pho but Superior Pho is still my first choice for that dish .. still, good to have another option when Superior Pho may have a line out the door .. did not enjoy the fried rice .. it was soggy, greasy & quite honestly tasteless .. w/out adding salt & the sweet/sour sauce they offered on the table it would have not been eaten at all .. leftovers did not come home with us"}
{"text":"Great vermicelli dishes, packed with flavor and filling.  The pho was good, but even after ordering a large I was still hungry.  Maybe at other pho places I've been to they put more noodles in the dish to fill you up.  I'd like to try some of their other dishes sometime."}
{"text":"I've been to Minh-Anh a handful of times for both dining and take-out. Most recent trip was for take-out which is the basis of this review. 

Service: called in and was immediately placed on hold for about five minutes which I thought was pretty good for 7pm. Food was ready for pick up in 20 minutes (previous visits ranged from 15-30 mins). Staff is East Coast friendly - direct and short but in a welcoming way. 

Ambience: The first thing you notice upon walking into Minh-Anh is a fish tank right in front of you and the smell of Americanized East Asian food (think typical Chinese takeout joint). Booths and tables pack the little restaurant. It's always at least half full whenever I stop in. Walnut wood panel lines the walls while bamboo and house plants hang throughout adding to the decor. There is a bench in front of the cash register for pick up customers. 

Product: food was ready on time, and still hot when I arrived home about ten minutes later. I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli. The pork was marinated in a soy sauce (and possibly fish sauce) based mixture which was pleasant and not too salty. The meat was cooked through but not overdone as it retained some juiciness and the grill added some nice char to the exterior. Vermicelli (rice pasta slightly thicker than spaghetti) was cooked past al dente, and served near room temperature. The contrast between the warm pork and cool pasta was very nice. I wonder if the contrast would have been more extreme had I dined in instead of carried out. The dish was served with a cool lightly pickled cucumber, carrot, and daikon salad along with crushed peanuts and crispy fried shallot bits. Both were welcomed accompaniments which added crunch to the dish along with a refreshing brightness that played well with the rich pork. 

Overall: recommended"}
{"text":"Best egg roll in the city, that's a guarantee. My go to is the chicken fried rice, it is served fresh, hot, and filling. You can get an easy two meals out of this dish and the price is right ($9). I prefer take out, in all honesty the service is slow and sometimes strained and the place is a little drafty. Everyone has always been very nice thoigh, and it always feels good to support a family run establishment. 

Pros: price, egg rolls, and portions
Cons: service is slow but well meaning"}
{"text":"I can't explain how much I love this place.  

The pho is somed kind of mood enhancing elixir made by some magician in the kitchen.  

From the moment you walk through the door you are taken care of quickly and carefully without too many interruptions - sit down, eat, pay, leave happy.

If you haven't gone here yet, do yourself a favor and GO NOW."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after an afternoon of sledding at Edgewater park.

I have eaten my share of good Vietnamese food -- used to live in Houston, which is full of great Vietnamese cuisine. I also am very partial to Superior Pho here in Cleveland. I felt that this place rather forgettable -- not great, but not terrible either.  We got the pork vermicelli and vegetable egg roll vermicelli dishes, which were decent -- filling and not overly expensive. The pork and egg rolls were tasty, but the vermicelli noodles and veggies were bland.

The pot of hot chrysanthemum tea that came out was, overly sweet. I'm not Vietnamese so am not sure if this is usual practice, so please forgive my ignorance, but in my Taiwanese household -- and at any number of Asian restaurants -- chrysanthemum and other teas are usually not sweetened.

The restaurant itself wasn't anything fancy, and the petite older woman who served us was sweet.

I can tell that in a few months I will probably forget this place altogether. It wasn't a bad experience, but it surely wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"amazing food, so authentic!  Best pho I've had in Cleveland so far!!  The shrimp rolls were also to die for!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago as I was craving Vietnamese food. They have a new menu that day but it is basically the same in my opinion. The food was very delicious and it brings me back home. I have yet to try their Pho (beef noodle soup) but their Bun Thit Nuong (vermicelli with chargrilled pork) is on par with Superior Pho in downtown Cleveland.

The dish was amazing and reminded me of SoCal despite the cold weather (and the first snow fall of Winter) in Cleveland. The wait staff was very quick and attentive and were really informed with what the new items were on the menu.

If you are in west Cleveland and craving some Vietnamese food, I would definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"Small little place with super tasty pho. I always get pho here, it's one of the best tasting in my opinion. Service is fast and to the point."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with Vietnamese cuisine, but I love the food here.  The menu is extensive so there's always something new to try, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  

It's been awhile since I've been to Minh Anh, but I can almost taste their Pork Vermicelli dish; it's served with a sweet and tangy sauce I wish I knew how to make, and I usually get one of their shrimp spring rolls on the side.  The portions are always satisfying, and their soups are really tasty, as well.  

I've also always had great service here, whether I'm picking up a to-go order or eating in their comfy, clean and home-y dining room (complete with giant fish tank).  Once, a friend of mine was treating me to lunch and we got so wrapped up in talking that he forgot to pay, and the guy who came out after us didn't have a meat cleaver in his hand or anything.  Sweet.

I also heard a Vietnamese version of \"Oops, I Did it Again\" on their Muzak system, which was definitely worth its weight in laughter."}
{"text":"Minh Anh is wonderful. I cannot say enough good things about it.

It's hard to go wrong with with your order, that's for sure. The Pho Saigon (with cinnamon beef) is to die for. I am reckless with my application of Sriracha when it comes to pho, and the flavor of the cinnamon still came through easily. The Egg Roll Vermicelli is a wonderful, unique, and pretty huge dish, could probably be split between two people.  And I highly recommend the Lotus Root Salad. It's an awesome, refreshing and sweet salad (definitely big enough to share) that's crunchy and glorious.

The service is friendly and fast, and the price is great! It gives Superior Pho a run for its money as my favorite Vietnamese in the city."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho I've ever had! Decided to try the shrimp pad Thai, the shrimp was so delicious & cooked perfectly! Definitely some of the best food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I considered giving 4 stars, but basically this place is a 3.5 and I decided to go with the 3.

I ordered Chicken Curry, my girlfriend the Veggie Stir Fry. Both were rather unexciting, kind of bland, basic meals that didn't have a lot of taste or surprises.

So why not a 2 star rating then? 

The soup. We ended up splitting a bowl of a beef-and-noodle soup (can't remember which one) which was EXCELLENT. The broth was savory and delcious, but spiced with cinnamon and thus had wonderful sweet/spicy undertones. The beef was spiced and tender and complemented the broth very well.

The soup we ate before our meal was definitely the best part of the meal, which was rather disappointing (both by itself and in comparison). We didn't even take the leftovers home.

Price was OK-reasonable, $34 with tax and tip for 2. They do charge individual for soda btw (by the can)."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I discovered it in the 1980s when I lived in Cleveland and I am so pleased that I was able to stop here during my recent weekend trip.  The pho is amazing. I love the authentic quality of the place and hearing the family members speaking Vietnamese in the background. This place has a cool vibe. While it's not in the safest area the owners made it safer for customers by having parking in the back which is pretty much fenced in. When I stopped the flowers blooming in the backyard were spectacular. It can seem like a small botanical garden. It's also humorous to see the life-size cast rooster set up high in the garden. I don't know if this is for spiritual or practical reasons. Yeah, definitely a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice since I only visit Ohio once a year or less. Great Vietnamese food, pretty good size menu, good service, huge portions. Might come back next time I'm in Cleveland as well. I don't know what else I could ask for, free egg rolls? :P"}
{"text":"Whenever I get back 'home' I make sure to stop by Minh-Anh Vietnamese Restaurant. Cheap eats and oh so good! I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where good Vietnamese food abounds, but Minh-Anh's is the best Vietnamese home cooking I've had yet. It's been a favorite of mine for over 15 yrs now!

I always start with the sweet chrysanthemum (hot) tea. I found their vegetarian fried egg rolls were too much roll and not enough filling, however, their fresh shrimp rolls were delish. My usual is their vegetable lo mein (with rice noodles); a large serving with a variety of veggies, and lots of them. And by large, I mean enough to feed two of my sort-a-watching their weight girlfriends. Me? ... I eat it all! I'm like a starved college kid that had been living on top ramen and returned home to Mom's home cooking. And living 2500 miles away? ... Who knows when I'll be back!

My all-American, not adventurous, husband thinks their pho is great; lots of flavor and NOT salty. By far, the best he's tried in Cleveland. Eats don't seem to be spicy (a wise and I'm sure conscience choice - to appeal to their Midwestern, Cleveland clientele), but they do have Sriracha hot chili sauce on the tables.

There are a few spaces for street parking in front and ample parking in back. They're Vietnamese market was attached at one time, but they have expanded and moved to a bigger space next door. It's not located in the best of neighborhoods (54th & Detroit), and may be the humblest of places, but it's clean, the service is prompt, the prices low and the food is yum-o.

{"text":"I used to love Minh Ahn.. Not sure what happened tonight?

I do still like their pork vermicelli, however, their wait staff tonight was horrible.

My friend and I went here tonight for dinner. When I asked the waiter for his recommendations were, he goes \"noodles or rice?\" I state \"for both.\" He goes \"the vermicelli is good as they are a rice noodle with daikon and some vegetables with it.\" Errrrr yes, I know what vermicelli is! I prod further \"which one?\" And he gestures with his hand, making a circle the size of the menu \"these ones.\" 

My blank stare continues. \"Ok, how about rice?\" He goes \"the beef and chicken are good\" once again, gesturing with his hand a large circle, about encompassing the entire \"beef and chicken\" categories on the menu. I let it slide. 

My friend ordered a spring roll. Out came a summer roll. We gestured to him that we had ordered a summer roll, and he goes \"well we only have egg rolls and spring rolls here.\" And then proceeded to argue with us, saying there was no summer roll, and we were mistaken with our definition of a spring roll. Excuse me?! I felt my patience slowly leave me...

My grilled pork and rice dish came out... With my sunny side egg not even being yolky enough to pierce- totally overdone. My friend's pork vermicelli looked good as always.

Our waiter even tried to take my plate away while I still had food on it. Ugh.

I think if our waiter hadn't been so bad, my review of Minh Ahn would be better. Usually I enjoy my times when I visit. That waiter definitely left a bad taste in my mouth though!

If you don't get that waiter, Minh Ahn is really worth the try- lots of phos, noodle dishes, crepes and many other items. I really enjoy the food but the quality of the waitstaff truly disappointed me this time!  Maybe next time will be better..!"}
{"text":"wow this place is very busy and very tasty!

it is apparent that this is a home run business. the food tasted pretty homey and they are pretty well done! we ordered this pho with everything in it. the soup tasted very different from other pho places that I have been to - it is a lot more flavorful and a little sweeter. the noodles in pho were also a little thicker than other places. the beef slices were thicker as well and they added in some purple onions in the soup, which really added a kick to it. the portion size is also pretty reasoninable. overall, a dish that I would highly recommend.

the second dish we ordered was the Vietnamese crepe with seafood and chicken. it is a fairly oily dish but I think if they didn't put enough oil, they wouldn't be able to achieve the crispy crepe texture. the stirrings in side was a little plain compare to other dishes but I think its an ok dish to try.

the third one we ordered was grilled pork vermicelli. it was SO GOOD. They gave us a lot of pork and with the fish sauce mixed together, it was perfect in terms of the flavor and the vege meat and noodle portion. highly recommend!

my only complain was the service. we went there and were not sure if we should wait at the door or at the cashier desk. and we were waiting by the door for a while till we got seated. and it also took them a while to get our order and get ua food. I think it was just a very busy friday night and they are just a little under staffed."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, the Pho was soooo good. My friend ordered the Pad Thai and I sampled some of it. It was delicious! Might even be better than Ty Fun's pad thai which is my favorite in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Some pho-tastic soups here.

We came for a late lunch, and it was surprisingly busy.  Annoying, because there was one server and it took a while to get our drinks, but also good because let's face it, I've been in some creepy empty asian restaurants where they're sitting around a table watching asian soaps while eating and it makes me uncomfortable.  

We all got a different variation of Pho, I think #20-22, I asked for mine without the beef balls.  They just seem weird.  Well, they came in my pho anyway, and they were a bit odd.  That's okay, more beef balls for my friends.  

We also ordered chicken wings, fried, to start.  I was a little weirded out since I can get wings anywhere, but these were some GOOD wings.  I guess most things fried are good, but man tender and juicy and skin falling off the bone good.  

Our server apologized once she got her ducks in a row and was very friendly.  We were all friends again.

There is parking on the side of the building with a surprisingly beautiful garden full of hibiscus plants in the back, in case you need somewhere to wander while waiting for your drinks.  

I'll be back, pho sho."}
{"text":"One of my favs and the wait staff is ridiculously nice and accommodating of my children. I eat here once every two weeks because of it and they know us by name. Great Pho on the sweeter side the way I prefer."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to order pho! I go to Minh-Anh about once a month, sometimes more, whenever my friends and I get the craving! The egg rolls are the best I have ever had. Flakey, always warm, and delicious! I always get the #20 pho with the cinnamon rare beef. If you're craving pho this is the place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Superior Pho out first day in town due to the Yelp reviews. The pho and banh mi sandwich was good...until we came here tonight at Minh-Anh for dinner. This has the best pho I've ever had from Seattle to San Francisco and Buffalo. The broth is very flavorful and I could have eaten it without adding condiments. We got #22 which is a combination of all meats and meatballs. One of the biggest things I love about Minh-Anh is that they use the wider noodles which you don't see often as many Pho places prefer the thinner noodles. It has one of the best tasting broth without having to add siracha and hosin sauce. The shrimp spring rolls were generously filled with shrimp and lettuce leaves (not iceberg lettuce), the only thing missing was bean sprouts. I had the deluxe crepe which had shrimp, chicken and pork filled with bean sprouts and veggies. It was very, very good with a large portion size and delicious sweet and spicy sauce to pour over or on. My friend got the pork vermecilli bowl which was also very good with the pork cooked to perfection.

Our waitress was great and very accommodating with us wanting to split our pho. Great service, great food. Best place in Cleveland to get Pho for sho!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is awesome. All their pork dishes are really good. My favorite is the pork vermicelli, which I can easily split into two meals. I think they have the cheapest pho (under $7) around Cleveland, too. I brought a friend who has never had Vietnamese food here once, and the descriptions in the menu were really helpful in directing him to something he would enjoy. The only thing I've had here that I wasn't so happy with was the crepe because the shrimp was overcooked. Otherwise, everything is perfect and it's one of the best deals in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here this past week. It was my first time in and I was pleasantly surprised. 

Minh-Anh is a small whole in the wall place where from the outside you wouldn't give it a second thought. But you don't go here for the atmosphere you go for the food. 

My favorite dish is the vermicelli with chicken. Or pork! Or steak! Or seafood! Ok any vermicelli is awesome!! I look forward to popping in again soon for the pho. Good find."}
{"text":"I was feeling terrible with allergies and just wanted some pho to make me feel better. Minh-anh definitely did not disappoint. I ordered delivery through door dash so I'm not sure if they do their own delivery. I ordered the rare beef cinnamon pho with a shrimp Vietnamese roll. Both were delicious! The only thing I would have changed was the peanut sauce for the roll. I like my sauce a little thinner and this was a little to thick like peanut butter for my taste. The pho had tons of noodles and such a nice rich and flavorful broth. I will be headed back here again to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I had Pad Thai, and it was fresh, delicious, and a hefty serving size. The place was clean, service was fast, and we were all very pleased with our meals."}
{"text":"I love the interior of the restaurant. It is such a nice welcoming scene. I love the wood walls and the fish tanks right in the doorway. Minh-Anh is also my favorite place to go for pho. It is a little bit on the salty side but the flavors are much more intense than any other place around. I try to order something different on the menu each time I go. Some of my new favorites are the grilled pork with rice and beef vermicelli. I believe the prices have went up a dollar or so in the last year and I am happy to pay that extra charge for great food. And don't let the white servers throw you off like they did old Steve L. Minh-Anh is not just my favorite Vietnamese place in Cleveland, it is one of my favorite restaurants all around."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I got it for carry out and the food was very weird. I got the hibachi chicken and it was nothing like what I expected. I also wanted a side of lomein and instead got some weird white noodle with nothing on it. Maybe it just didn't hit my taste buds but the food was dry and one of the sauces smelled absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"The website, building exterior and building interior do not do much to encourage you to eat here. However if you ignore all of those things and come inside you will find a great restaurant! The portions are large and the food is really good! I had the chicken hibachi and really enjoyed the meal. The flavours were perfect and the veg and chicken were served on a bed of several large lettuce leaves. It was served with a side of sticky white rice. My friend got one of the pho/soups which are quite popular here. No matter what you get - from an egg roll app to jasmine hot tea you will not be disappointed in the food quality of this family owned restaurant. The menu is huge so you will surely be able to find something whether you want seafood, beef, chicken or none of the above. The place is very small so be prepared for a brief wait - on a Saturday night at around 1930 all the seats were full!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal! We ordered fried wontons, pho, shrimp spring rolls and pad thai. Their homemade duck sauce with the fried wontons was outstanding and the peanut sauce that came with the springrolls, well, I want to eat it by the bowl full. The only reason I didn't give five stars was the service. It's a small dining room, but they were consistently busy while we were there. It was a typical case of being understaffed, which is unfortunate. However, I don't think it will stop us from going again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! We go every week. You have to try their pho #22"}
{"text":"Wanted Vietnamese food while my husband wanted banh mi sandwiches. This was the best of both worlds since there was a grocery a few doors down that he could purchase the sandwich and bring it back to the restaurant. I'm sure we were frowned upon but we're not from the area so we didn't care  we wanted Vietnamese food! He was told he had to buy at least 3 sandwiches from the waiter at the restaurant but luckily he persuaded the guy at the grocery to just make one. It was ok. Now on to the restaurant review. Atmosphere is nothing to write home about which is typical of many Asian restaurants as long as you get quality food. Summer roll was ok. Didn't need to order 1 each. We could have split it. The vermicelli noodles with pork and nuk mam sauce was excellent and the kids liked the fried rice. Win win!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town, hands down!  Did you hear me Cleveland?  Best pho, for sho!  =D

OMG... Ever since leaving the LA-area in 2004, I have been in search for pho done right.  Every city I've lived in, I try out all the \"Vietnamese\" restaurants hoping to find that delicate balance of heavenly broth, tasty meat, without skimping on noodles, and with a quality veggie tray.  This is the first time my bf has ever heard me say \"this pho can stand its own with the best of LA.\"

Thank you Minh-Anh.  Really.  It's heavenly.  And please.. don't change a thing in the pho.  It's perfect just as it is.

He got the Shrimp Singapore noodle, which was also delicious.  It was not the traditional singapore shrimp noodle that we're used to getting... but we already knew it wouldn't be quite \"right\" based on previous pictures.  It has similar flavors, is yummy the way it's served, but he will have to continue searching for perfect execution of one of his favorites.

Regardless, we will be back.  Likely fairly often.  We both LOVE pho and would not dream of getting it anywhere else.  drool  =D~~

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"This place had an authentic selection and overall feel to it. The caucasian waitress threw me off at first on the authenticity of the place,but,she was very polite so I gave it the authentic vote. Got the chx crepes,it filled the entire plate and was excellent. Neighborhoods up and coming quick,glad to be a Gordon Square resident."}
{"text":"Ive had both their pho and lemon grass chicken. Small place but looks good and clean. Food is good too."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I rushed into Minh Anh 20 minutes before closing on a Sunday evening.  So, the restaurant gets points just for managing to serve us 3 dishes in that span of time.  Our waitress was ultra helpful and efficient. 

Foodwise, the pho soup was a welcome contrast to both Superior and #1--headier, with a more intense cinnamon flavor, there was no doubt it was slow-simmered beef broth.  We also had the Vietnamese noodle salad and crepes, but both were nothing to write home about. Nevertheless, I'd make a special trip out to the Detroit Shoreway just for the pho!"}
{"text":"If you love dining out and trying new places, Min Ahn is the place for you. This little Vietnamese place is about as authentic as they come and while it's not at all fancy or would be categorized as fine dining, it's definitely one of the greatest places in Cleveland and one that we go to often when we are heading to basketball games. 
I am in love with the spring rolls and the papaya salad and make sure to get mine spicy. So fresh and filled with flavors - fish, cilantro- pepper- etc. it's the perfect combination of tastes and flavor. As for the main meals, they have some great pho bowls and we always get the spicy chicken one to share. Most of my family gets the birds nest which is a mess of delicious chicken and veggies swimming in a spicy gravy atop a bed of fried noodles-Iike a birds nest. The gravy soaks into the fried noodles and it's the most delicious thing to eat.
As for decor, sort of plain and like I said, not at all fancy. Just some tables and chairs and some simple pictures on the wall. No problem as the prices and the food cannot be beat and really, that's the focus.
If you want some delicious Vietnamese food, head over to Min Ahn and enjoy."}

{"text":"A small group of friends and I popped into Minh-Anh last Friday for a late dinner. The place was packed (only one open table that had been recently vacated and not yet cleared), but a server let us know that we could only do take-out because they were closing in fifteen minutes (it was 9:22). We were a little disappointed because their hours online indicated that they would be open later, but we were hungry and happy that we could at least take some food to go. 

I ordered the lemongrass shrimp vermicelli and the dish was fine. The shrimp were slightly over cooked and the noodles were lacking sauce which made the dish a little dry. I enjoyed the peanuts and dried onions on the side, as well as the lettuce and picked vegetables. The fish sauce tasted homemade and was a welcome addition to add some moisture to the noodles. Flavor was good overall but there could have been some improvements. My friends mostly ordered curry dishes and they looked and smelled really good, so I'd be inclined to try one of those next time! 

Upon checking out, we did see a sign that said they'd now be closing at 9:45 on Fridays."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese place ever ! I've been here 10+ times and I've ever had a bad experience. Definitely recommend the egg roles and chicken wonton soup. The wontons in the soup are the best that I have ever had. Also -- check out the market next door ! You can find a lot of cool items."}
{"text":"Pho broth is sweeter than I prefer, with a strong undertone of cinnamon, and it slightly bothers me that they don't serve the herbs on the side, which is how most restaurants serve them. They also don't offer tendon pieces, which is something I absolutely love as an add on for noodle soups. However the service here is great and the location is modest but cozy. I might return to try other things off their menu, but it isn't my first choice for Vietnamese food."}
