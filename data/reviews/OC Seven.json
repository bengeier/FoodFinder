{"text":"We visited this restaurant because we were staying at the adjacent hotel, and they gave us a $75 gift card to use at the restaurant or spa. I was a little nervous because we were the only people there for lunch on a Saturday at 11:30am. The service was excellent and the food was very good. We first ordered the spring rolls, which I thought were just ok. They were mostly ground pork and onion in a fried won-ton, very little 'spring' in my roll. My husband and I shared a gorganzola and steak salad that was very good, and a chicken sandwich. We chose the sweet potato fries to go with the sandwich. They were the best I've ever had! So crunchy and light. Not mushy at all like others I've had. This place doesn't offer much in the way of atmosphere, but you can sit by the windows and watch the tennis courts. It is a nice spot if you are staying at the hotel or nearby."}
{"text":"Been there on several Friday nights and the food is less then stellar.  Over priced with very little flavor.  Never had anything that I would want to order again.  The value is not there to make us wanting to come back and eat again.   Entertainment with Rags Allen is one of the best in the valley.   Very limited menu without a great selection and choices.   Coconut Shrimp is just that,  shrimp in size and not much to eat.  I have the Pork Chile Verde and it was filled with rice without a good flavor.  My advise,  Eat Elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just so there are no surprises, this restaurant, open to the public, is in the Scottsdale Athletic Club. It has a high wall of windows that fronts the tennis courts, so without a doubt, it has a clubby feel to it, but the bright and airy type of club, not the dark woody type where you hunch over a scotch. Lots of tennis whites, well OK, and a strong majority of white folk in here too as you might expect at a tennis club, but ironically the club owner is a self-made success, immigrant from China, and a hell of a smart, hard-working guy, who happens to love tennis. 

The restaurant features a lot of comfort foods like meatloaf, a rich mac n cheese, and fantastic sandwiches. My favorite lunch fare is an amazing short-rib sandwich. Wow. It knocked my socks off the first time I had it. 

If you use the club or work in the area, it's definitely worth stopping by for lunch, and they also do take-out. The bar is nice, and sports-focused.  Dinner is good as well, kind of pricier and more formal versions of the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The only reason to go here for dinner is for the live entertainment.  The duo we saw a few weeks ago was GREAT.  Venue is like a Holiday Inn lounge It's just the tables/chairs have a 'cheap' feel.  Need to upgrade to be taken seriously.

  We won't go here to 'eat' again.   Might go just for drinks- entertainment was great.

I had a Chinese Chicken Salad which was basically a bowl full of iceberg lettuce with some chicken on top... a few almonds mixed in with crunchies/ chinese noodles on top and an asian dressing.   Definitely not worth 10.00.   If they want to be successful, they need to make this place a desination- which, given the live music, they could with good food.   My friends had the ahi tuna... comment was:  Likely bought at Costco.  It's fine- fine meaning 'something I could make at home'.   And the chili= not made from scratch, it's ok.  Ok, meaning 'something I could make at home or pour out of a can'.

  SO... go here for a few drinks to hear the live entertainment which we found to be GREAT... Delphine Cortez/ Joel Robin.  They were awesome.  I think they only are there on Saturdays, though.  

  Hopefully, they will work on the food- there is no way it is worth the 85.00 we paid for food/wine/ tip for three people."}
