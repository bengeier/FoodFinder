{"text":"One of my new favourite pizza places. I got a veggie slice to go had nice light thin crust, topped with spinach, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese. Not super cheesy, not greasy, and none of this boring green pepper/mushroom business that's so typical."}
{"text":"Every time I've walked past this place it's empty.  Not a good sign.  Regardless, I decided to give this place a shot 'cuz I'm always looking for the next hole in the wall dive, hoping that it'll surprise me.   The day I went however, the place was jam packed.  Turns out it was the owner's son's 2nd birthday and everyone in the place was family.    Cute kids.  Bad pizza.    Ordered their chicken pesto pizza.  The pie came out dry and tasteless.  I couldn't taste the pesto, dough was cardboardy and the chicken was frown worthy.  I'm really disappointed because I was hoping it would give Cafe Diplomatico across the street a run for it's money, but it didn't even come close.  It's a real shame because I don't want to bad mouth a small family business, but the pizza just wasn't very good.  Sorry John.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"The pizza a flat and dry: Imagine eating a ShamWow. If you order your typical pepperoni slice, you will find no evidence of sauce or cheese. You will want to wash it all down with a pint in which you will get more head than a pride parade.  If you are a glutton for punishment as I am, go for an  espresso when you are done.   It has all the bitterness of your last relationship."}
{"text":"Me and my friends have been ordering from John's for delivery the past few weeks, so this review is based on delivery and not the actual place. I seem to remember going there in person a few years ago and it's like a dark cave with zero ambiance. I do like the stone work outside though!  So this pizza is really good in my mind. We just get very basic kinds like veggie deluxe or a mixture of favourites (pepperoni, green pepper, mushroom) and they all taste delicious. I like the crust and that's rare for me when it comes to pizza. It's very thin but soft so when you get to the end it's like a continuation of the pizza. Rather than being discarded back into the pizza box, it ends up in my belly.  I've never actually made the call to John's so I can't say how easy/difficult it is to get an order through, but the pizza has always arrived quickly (I don't think anyone orders from them) and tastes great."}
{"text":"Hmm. This place has some problems with consistency. But I actually really like their pesto slice. At least as it was at one time. Not sure I've ever tried any of the other slices actually. It used to have goat cheese on it. I love goat cheese. I dont remember any chicken being involved. Frankly, I don't consider chicken to be a valid pizza topping.   Perhaps this thin crust style pizza where the toppings are pretty well baked in isn't for everyone, but i like it. If i find myself in the little italy area, which is not often actually, I will go to this place for a late night eat. I can ALWAYS eat food late at night even if i'm not hungry :)"}
