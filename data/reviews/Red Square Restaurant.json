{"text":"Was complety empty. Stayed anyways. Food was okay but obviously no ambiance. Asked for 2 beers of a specific kind. They only had one. Brought it out but it had a fruit fly in it so re-ordered.   Would have been okay if they didn't add gratuity and asked for a tip on top of that after suggesting 15% as the lowest option tricking clients into paying more if they didn't see the gratuity note.   Won't be going back. Hope that extra tip keeps them going..."}
{"text":"After many months of trying to organize a dinner to come here, we finally made it over the weekend! I couldn't be happier with the choice to come here. I first approached my Russian friend about going to a Russian restaurant because I've never had Russian food before, and she only knew of two. Which was out in Mississauga somewhere. Not wanting to drive too far, I did a search on various sites for Russian food and whadoyouknow slim pickings for Russian food. I don't remember how i found this one but this had an attractive website and the ambiance looks very classy so we decided to give it a go here. We finally set a date to come here, lo and behold it was fully booked that weekend. I called on a Tuesday night for a reservation for Saturday(that's how I ended up at Frida btw). So a few weeks later we decided to give it a try again, this time i made sure I called extra early to get a reservation. I arrived to find the restaurant is located in a strip plaza, not a place you would expect to find a decent restaurant.  So on to the food, I let my friend handle the appetizers, the choices she picked out were amazing! The appetizers are meant to be shared, cuz the portions were huge! By far the highlight was the Dimon - Crunchy Salad - fried potatoes in a heavenly sauce. The Red Square salad - basically a potato salad, was well done. The homemade salmon lox was good, the caviar with crepes was simple, but good nonetheless with big round blobs of goodness. The pickled assortment was interesting, they had pickled tomatoes, apples, cauliflower, and cucumbers. Although i did not try the soups my friends who ordered it gave it a big thumbs up. Now on to the main dishes, my lamb chops were amazing, tender and flavourful. I tried a bit of the duck, it was good. Both were not really a Russian style. If you want to try something that is of Russian cuisine I was told the Chicken Keiv or the oven roasted Chilean sea bass. Also the complimentary bread is Russian style, they bake it in house and let me tell you it was good!  Service was excellent, they'll ask you if you ever had Russian food before, if not they would explain. They were more than helpful explaining the dishes on the menu. On the weekends they have a live band, they play Russian and English songs. My friend called it lame, but too me it's part of the Russian experience!"}
{"text":"Being half Russian (the vodka loving half) - how could I not venture to check out the Red Square Russian after one of my 100% Russian pals invite me to tag along on their night of cultural resurgence,  Struck by the opulence of the dinning room when I first walked in, I suddenly felt a little under dressed, but no worries my tummy was wining the battle over my vanity.  Yum, yum, yum is all I can say! I never thought anyone could make a better borscht than my dad... I was wrong. Sorry dad."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service, just a few small quirks that didn't go over well but all-in-all I'm coming back :-D  Ended up finding this place via a group deal site where I bought a voucher for it.  There was a misunderstanding in the reservation where I asked to move our appointment from 7 P.M. to 8 P.M. for two people, where-as they misunderstood my change request to 8 people. We ended up working that out, so no big deal there.  I'm 3 quarters Russian, so all-in-all I know a fair amount of my Russian food. The pelmeni (my fav food) soup was very good, and the Red Square salad I must say was rather amazing, among the other things we had.  The server forgot to place my mashed potatoes in the end with the rest of the \"to go\" items after having confirmed with me that I wanted to take it with us, which is a shame as I barely got a chance to touch it :-(  One of the best parts of the experience was that the server noticed that my voucher was good for up to $100 before taxes, he told me that I should get the most out of my money and get more things as I had to pay for the taxes that weren't included anyways.  Like I mentioned initially in the review, I'm definitely returning as the service was very professional and the food was quite good as well."}
{"text":"I was at Red Square for the wedding.  Interior design, food and service are great!    The location is a little awkward because it is located next to a spa ....so you come out for a smoke in a nice dress and half naked guy stand beside you smoking.   Entertainment is ok, I've seen better in other Russian Restaurants."}
{"text":"Over priced but very good food at this place! Way too good to knockdown just for the pricing!!!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. Food and Service were great. Music was awesome. I'll definitely go back and will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Visited this place few times. Every time good prepared food and friendly service. Patagonian (Chile) Bass and hand made Pelmenie you have to try."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty luxurious, however I felt like the music could use classical music or jazz rather than soft rock. My first impressions on the waiter was very medicore as he was very snappy, however he was very professional and in the end he opened up a bit more. The food was very delicious although the plating may need some work, I found the chicken schnitzel a bit bland but the meat was very delicate, and juicy. It was also not too oily. I highly suggest their dessert pelmeni as I was very light, healthy and cleansed my pallet. Over all it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner food was ok.  Service was friendly and prompt. There was virtually no one in the restaurant. The food was expensive at $50 per person. For the average quality of food I don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Always consistent in serving good food !  Restaurant is decorated beautifully , and when booked for a private function - never disappoints It is hard to come across good russian food in the community -this is definitely the top of my list"}
