{"text":"Well I tried Olive Chicken today. It is as good as people say, and then some! After wolfing down 5 pieces, I could've gone for another five! Chicken was crispy, fresh, and hot. Service was typical - over the counter fare. Better than KFC or Chicken-On-The-Way for sure. They have combo packs of 3 chickens and fries you can try. You can also order 10 and 20 piece combos."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered a large chicken kangjung to share. The portion size wasn't huge for the price (around $17 I believe), but it was delicious. Very crispy and the sauce was slightly spicy and SO tasty. The cashier/server was gracious and sweet. We will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I visit Calgary - their super crispy, delish chicken is to die for! I always get the half and half since I get to enjoy both amazing flavours. Growing up in Korea I know how the Korean-style fried chicken should taste, and this place really knows how to do it right!"}
{"text":"Im sure glad I dont live near Olive Chicken.This stuff is crazy delicious, and I could see myself indulging more than I should. For $8, I had a 2pcs chicken, with rice, salad and a bottle of water (you can also sub water for a canned pop) The rice was bland, but well cooked, the salad was iceberg. Nothing to write home about, but the dressing was good. The chicken was crispy,and juicy, not greasy like Chicken on The Way or KFC. As others have mentioned, it doesnt have any seasoning, but for me, I prefer it this way. Its always easier to add more flavour to your meal. There is a sweet and hot sauce that comes on the side, I found it tasted like jam with some chili flakes mixed in, so I skipped using it. The menu focuses mostly on chicken and its sides, but did offer red bean cake and ice cream as well. The restaurant itself is quite small, with a handful of tables and on a nice day there are a couple of tables outside as well. Service is friendly, quick and  you can see how clean it is with the open kitchen in plain sight. TWO THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's very small, only a few tables, mostly take-out and seems to have a great lunch crowd from the businesses around it. We've always had a great meal from there and we've recommended this place to several others.  We were thanked once for telling someone about Olive Chicken who in turn gave us a gift card for there. The menu is simple and basic and over the years more items have been added. Another addition we have recently discovered is that skipthedishes.ca delivers food  from there and our order just showed up......"}
{"text":"Ordered the hot and sweet wings.... Felt the sweetness but it was cold. Very disappointing. I actually prefer the original restaurant on 10 Ave"}
{"text":"One of the pioneering Korean style fried chicken places in town, it has been eclipsed by others with tastier meat, crispier coating, and more side & sauce options. The chicken itself has gone down in quality (odd texture & flavour) over the years, so it's better than KFC but we'd rather hit up other Korean joints."}
{"text":"Pluses:  The chicken is very crispy, and not greasy, unlike The Chain That Shall Not Be Named.  The pieces are a good size, and the prices quite reasonable.  The poutine is hot, with melted curds and a beefy gravy.   Minuses: Lack of seasoning.  Luckily this is why they invented salt packets...use them and you'll enjoy the chicken a lot more!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Calgary. This little shop puts Chicken on the Way and all the franchises to shame. It can take a while to get your order as they fry chicken to order but the wait is well worth it.   By using olive oil (therefore the name) to fry the chicken, Olive Chicken gives their meals a less greasy taste. Their batter makes for an extremely crunchy outside and the most moist chicken meat I have ever encountered in a fried chicken. When you bite into it, the meat is extremely juicy to the point you cant believe it just came out of a fryer even though you just watched the nice Korean ladies who run this shop pull it out of the fryer.   Sides includes fries and pickled veggies. The fries are ok and get the job done but the pickled veggies really help to clean the palate between bites. Also I forgot to mention that you can order original (very crispy) or gochujang covered fried chicken. Gochujang is more or less Korean ketchup with a slight kick and make an already delicious meal addictive and very messy.   Best method is to order and eat at one of the few tables available to maximize the crunch and warmth of the fresh fried chicken. The one downside is that the ventilation could use some improvement and your clothes will smell like fried chicken goodness after your meal. The half original and half gochujang meal is big enough for two people with extra to spare for less than $20, way better than a similarly priced bucket from the weird Colonel guy.  Good luck and good eating."}
{"text":"AMBIENCE: Small place with a handful of small tables. Staff were cheerful and attentative.++  FOOD: Had a large order of hot&sweet (21.99) and yam fries (5.99?). Chicken was freshly fried then dipped in their delicious hot&sweet sauce. Would have preferred if the chicken was actually marinated in a hot and sweet marinade then fried with a spicy of seasoning, but it's still pretty damn good for how simple it is. Yam fries were served with aioli and were as expected.++"}
{"text":"So good! I walked in and it was a clean and friendly environment. I ordered the crispy fried chicken and was surprised when the girl working there actually brought it over to me. When I looked at the chicken I didn't have high hopes. But it was actually really good! They also made it when I ordered it, instead of having a bunch of pre-made stuff. When I asked to use the bathroom, they actually let me walk through/past the kitchen to it, proving that they have nothing to hide. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't go out for fried chicken but I decided to drop by for a quick meal. I have to say the chicken was amazing and even the fries were great. Yes, it's fast food but if this is something you are looking for I suggest giving it a try. I mean if people are taking their leftovers home that has to be a good sign."}
{"text":"Olive chicken. I love chicken.  All of the chicken. I love chicken. Olive chicken.   Uhh... I guess there isn't really much that hasn't been said already. This is great fried chicken.  You should probably get it at least once a month in the summer and incorporated into some sort of beer drinking and outdoor recreation activity.  You should always make sure to order a half and half; the plain fried chicken is beautifully crispy with a lovely flavor (you may just need to make sure to sprinkler with a bit of salt), and while the sweet and spicy sauce coated version doesn't bring a ton of heat, it has a restrained sweetness and a funky, maybe garlicky, undertone that is absolutely addictive.  You shouldn't be compelled to order fries. They are fine, maybe a little above average, but will most certainly need a liberal sprinkling of salt. If you do order the fries, you should strongly consider a side container of sauce for dipping.   You should absolutely order a side of pickled daikon. It is tangy and refreshing, and everything that a sad little tub of KFC/PFK coleslaw wishes vainly to be.   You should maybe be aware that the chicken is not broken down in the western/traditional leg-thigh-breast pattern. While this may initially make it a little more difficult to determine if a piece will be dark or light meat, and result in the occasional inadvertent mouthful of cartilage or bone chunks (it's not nearly as bad as I've made that sound) it does mean that pieces cook more evenly, and you end up with a much better ratio of crispy breading to meat (no thick, dry, bland, thick whole breast chunks).  You should maybe also know that the main thing holding them back from 5 stars is the lack of patio and liquor license...but if you're creative, you can probably figure out a way to remedy that."}
{"text":"Do you love fried chicken? Because olive (fried) chicken hahaha But seriously though, with all the new KFC (Korean fried chicken) places popping up all over Calgary, it's hard to keep up.   With an order of chicken, fries and tempura veggies in tow, we met up with my parents for a quick dinner. Even after a 20 min drive, all the food still stayed hot and most importantly - crispy. The tempura veggies were really good, not oily at all. The crinkle fries held the seasoning salt well and the chicken was crispy and juicy. As usual, we ordered too much food but it was still as good the next day when we warmed it all up in the toaster oven.  If you enjoy fried chicken as much as I do, do yourself a favour and try out Olive Chicken. You get all the things you love about fried chicken, but not the heavy gross feeling afterwards."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. And I, like Terry, thought this place was a winner based on all the good reviews... it didn't happen.  Maybe i was expecting a salty, more flavorful meal. But instead, both times I came here, my chicken was tasteless - It was oily and the only flavor going for it was when I aided it with ketchup packets.  I'm sorry, I thought the second time would be really be a much better experience, but after I didn't finish my chicken, I had to go to Swiss Chalet just to make myself remember chicken can be delicious and flavorful.  Thank you for all the great reviews and being a great place for everyone to dine; just not for me."}
{"text":"A lovely young woman took my order with a smile and efficiency. As I waited for my food, I watched them and it looks like it's all made from scratch. The chicken is fresh and succulent, the coating is crispy and delicious.  I had the onion rings and they were pretty standard, probably from frozen, but good. The sauce! That Korean sauce is fantastic. Sweet and spicy and delicious. This may be my new fave takeout restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on down and got the hot n sweet chicken. Dont bother with the regular fried chicken, its a little bland compared to KFC / A&W etc, but the hot n sweet is amazing, much better than any other fried chicken!  for less than $10 I got 3PC meal (friend + can of pop). I like to call ahead to order so its ready when I get there. I also like to get a 10PC to take home and then I have left overs. They warm up nicely in the oven, about 375F for 15 mins.   EDIT: Upgraded to 5*  as Ive been back a half dozen times and cant get enough."}
{"text":"Love the chicken here! It is never too greasy and always tastes great. The inside of the place has few sit down spots but I would stick with take-out. If you like the traditional Korean fried chicken, ask for the spicy-sweet one for the extra spice."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fried chicken fan, but I do get a hankering for fried chicken a few times a year, and when the craving hits, I always come to Olive chicken! Nothing beats Olive Chicken's Korean-style fried chicken for crispiness, freshness (it's always piping hot!), and awesome flavours. The sweet and sticky style is a classic go-to, but my personal favourite is the ginger soy sauce chicken. Paired with a side of piping hot onion rings and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"KFC - Those 3 letters stand together as an iconic symbol in the fast food dining universe. Back when it was simply known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, it was still a decent choice for Southern-style fried chicken, something that was relatively special back in the day. I still remember picnics with those styrofoam salad containers of the florescent dayglo green coleslaw, the congealed gravy blob and the individual packets of the infamous 'spork' with the removable center tine that could be used as a toothpick.  Today, I am relieved to be part of a world where small businesses can still thrive and share the culinary landscape with the big boys. It is with that thought that I introduce my latest chicken fix - Olive Chicken, aka the other KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).  I first heard of Korean-style fried chicken from watching documentaries on Chef Danny Bowien during the whole rise of Mission Chinese Food and their incredible cookbook, \"Mission Street Food\". Their mantra was simple: take the best elements of your favourite dishes and amplify them. This is where Korean fried chicken comes in. If you ask anyone what their favourite part of fried chicken is, the answer will almost always be, \"that crunch!\"  Well, Olive fries a great chicken which is some of the best that I've had in these parts in a long time. The signature crunch is there, light and clean with plump, tender meat that's so incredibly juicy. It is available in 2 flavours (a clean classic flavour and a signature Korean gochujang-based flavour). The texture of Olive's chicken makes full use of the mantra, resulting in a product that captures all that is good about fried chicken and minimizing the things I don't necessarily care for, in this case, the heavy greasy feeling you get after downing a 4 piece meal at another one of my favourite Calgary landmarks, Chicken-on-the-Way.  That being said, another one of the great things about Olive that makes it unique is the Asian inspired choice of sides that are available like rice, fried veggies and the pickled daikon. I think that the daikon is genius since it really offers a nice refreshing bite amidst the savoury goodness of this seriously legit chicken.  The ladies behind the counter are very nice and friendly and run a clean and efficient kitchen. Take the time to savour when you come here, have a seat and enjoy your latest fix."}
{"text":"Yum! The crispy chicken tastes great, not greasy at all, way better KFC...lol I had the  combo 2, it comes with fountain drink, fresh green salad, and white rice. It was filling and delish"}
{"text":"Here for a weekend trip, love how it's downtown vicinity. Located in a Korean strip mall.   Delicious, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Alright so this is a corner shop for some KFC (Korean fried chicken).  Now they keep it simple with having 2 types of fried chicken:  the regular crispy fried chicken or having it smothered with sweet spicy sauce.... This is kinda cheating I would say for variety. ...but hey that's just me.  So this also comes with various sides, some fries or onion rings....Some nicely cubed pickled radish.   I don't believe there was alcohol sales....my mind can't remember.   Please correct if I am wrong.  Alright so flavor...you know what,  this really beats out the colonels recipe and Church's.   This would be a place I would come from time to time.  Try the sauce, it is a bit overwhelming when they drench the chicken in this red sauce.  But hey, it tastes pretty good.  Myself, it would have gone perfect with a bowl of white rice.  It was a fun night with friends sharing chicken at the table."}
{"text":"Bang for the buck? Check. Not feeling greasy as hell after MANY pieces of chicken? Yup. Got the half and half 5pc and it was awesome!! Would prefer the chicken to be a little hotter but next time I'll just get the extra hot sauce next time. Doesn't hurt also to have very cute girl up at front serving you (great service of course ;))!"}
{"text":"A friend told me to give Olive Chicken a try, and even though I am not really a big fan of breaded meats of any kind I decided to take her advice. I ordered a ten piece, half crispy half saucy, and an onion ring/fries combo with some daikon on the side.   I was really pleasantly surprised at how much I LOVED this chicken! The cornflake crust is super crispy without oozing grease, the meat inside is juicy, tender and flavourful. I like the variety of pieces you get, from breast to drumstick and wings. After two pieces I was very full. The saucy chicken was incredible too! The flavour was great, not spicy and a little sweet. The sauce does make the breading a bit less crisp but it still has a nice bite to it.   They must use really fresh oil because the taste was great and very clean. The only problem I have is that I live close-by so I think I will be eating this much more often! Whether you're a fan of fried chicken or not, after eating Olive Chicken you will be!"}
{"text":"Yummy I would recommend the extra hot and sweet with onion rings and you would be in love forever"}
{"text":"This place was our last resort but I was SO glad we came here! The food was a delightful surprise!  Yup: try the fried chicken but skip the chicken popcorn. The fried chicken was SO TENDER AND JUICY! The popcorn was actually more like chicken nuggets and they were dry, and got quite a heat to them!"}
{"text":"I've dropped by this location twice. The first time, the chicken was cut in small, irregular pieces and the meat itself was dry. The second time, the chicken was juicier.   If you have to choose between the 3 piece with fries and the two piece combo with rice, pick the latter. The chicken in the rice combo is larger and has some meat on them bones!   I would recommend to take-out rather than eat in. Both times I visited, the restaurant was freezing cold. If you like fried chicken, give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and reasonable pricing.  Asian KFC wins hands down.  The chicken is crisp and inside is very moist.   It doesn't leave you overly salted or feeling like a grease pit.  The pickled daikon radish gives a nice counterbalance to the inevitable grease.  Plus you can order steamed white rice to accompany the chicken to again counteract the grease.   Yam fries are tasty.  Onion rings are good also.  Deep fried mushrooms were a new experience for us.  It was different so not sure I'd order that on my own if it didn't come in the \"couples\" combo.  Which was 10 pieces plus assorted fries plus two pops.  Not sure how a normal couple could polish off that amount of food.  It was a great deal for $28 plus the cost of an extra bowl of white rice. Best thing was that chicken and assorted fries had no dairy or eggs which was perfect for our kids with allergies.  Watch out for the side mayo dip for yam fries however. Atmosphere was standard hole in the wall fast food pickup joint.  There were a few tables inside and two picnic tables outside.  It isn't fancy dining.  Rather just good food and friendly service. Nice alternative for suppers or later evening snacking.  Parking wasn't an issue as it is part of a small strip mall."}
{"text":"Cluck yeah!   Lately, I've been living my life in pursuit of fried chicken. (A truly noble pursuit.) With the help o' Yelp I found myself walking through the doors of Olive Chicken and also found what could be my new favourite!  Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. That's it, right? That's what makes fried chicken so good, and doing this so well is what makes olive chicken so good. So good.  All fried chicken is salty and greasy, says Dale as the polygraph needle goes flying across the chart. This is a lie! Olive Chicken is crispy and moist and wouldn't you know it, they seem to manage to keep the oil in the fryer without saturating the chicken pieces. How do you do it, Olive Chicken? Tell me your secret!  Now, I'm sure there are still healthier, even less greasy ways to do chicken, so if that's what you're looking for, just remember it is still deep fried, but that's what makes it so darn satisfying.  Their chicken tastes really...clean. Is that a thing? It just doesn't taste like years and years of deep fryer. Don't get me wrong, I love that too, but the Olive Chicken style was eye opening.  I got the small Half and Half order which comes with 3 pieces of regular, and 2 covered in their sweet spicy chilli sauce which I now want to put on everything! Chicken, steak, cereal, everything.   Honesty time - I licked the remaining sauce off of the tinfoil it came in, and I'm ashamed of it. And the polygraph flies off the rails for one part of that sentence. Can you guess which?"}
{"text":"Great flavor, crispy, not greasy.  Didn't let me feel like I need to drink a gallon of water an hour later.  Best fried chicken in Calgary."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is a bit odd, with a nicely updated seating area on one side while the other half looks like a dingy KFC circa 1993. That being said, aesthetics are not a priority when choosing a fried chicken joint.  The fried chicken is delicious, with a thick crispy breading with the option of taking it plain or doused in a sweet/spicy sauce. For the variety, I recommend the half and half. The fries and onion rings are mediocre, but acceptable.  On my last visit I came in just after open on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure whether it was because they had just opened or whether it's the norm, but I did have to wait almost half an hour to get my food."}
{"text":"Very nice service and delicious chicken! They have variety of different kinds and anyone can enjoy it. I suggest this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just walked in to have some dinner, had some good God here in the past, someone came out, walked the entire length of the counter, didn't acknowledge me, didn't even look at me (and there is a buzzer and I was standing right there at the till) zero, and went back to the back, stood for a couple more minutes and left, your chicken isn't that good, I won't be back."}
{"text":"YUM!    Can I say more?  We came here after the lunch rush, but parking was still a challenge in the little strip mall (we had to park on the street).     The boys ordered two combos that included 3 pieces of lightly battered, crispy chicken, fries and their choice of pop/water for $7.99.    I decided to try the small Half And Half: 3 pieces of regular fried chicken and 2 pieces of chicken in Hot and Sweet sauce.   The service was fast and efficient; in less than 10 minutes, our dishes were brought to our table.   Mmmmm... I loved that crunch on my first bite--not greasy at all and not too salty(like the Colonel's...)!  I couldn't get over how juicy the breast meat was! I think because the whole chicken breast was cut lengthwise(not your regular cut), the frying time would be shorter.  Quicker frying time=juicier chicken(less chance of it drying out)?  The Hot and Sweet sauce is quite addicting; it's not as spicy as that sweet chili sauce most Thai restaurants serve.  Hubby and son were dipping their fries in my sauce...       One important note: this is more a take-out than a dine-in place.  There are tiny tables inside(which can seat 3 or 4 people) and one or two tables with outside overlooking the street.  The washroom is pretty much for the staff, although they did allow us access to it.   I felt really awkward since I had to go through the kitchen where a couple of ladies were prepping chicken and the others were eating a late lunch.  What else could I do?  My hands were sticky from the Hot and Sweet sauce and I needed to wash them. ;)   We didn't have room for the poutine or pickled daikon,  we'll have to try it next time..."}
{"text":"amazeballs on the chicken.  Even though they were all kinda skimpy meat pieces, it was amazeballs.  The saucy is saucy and the crispy is crispyness!!  I love this place.  It beats ogam and wow hands down.  If you really want KFC (korean fried chicken) then this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken done right, the Korean way!  I'm not normally a big fan of fried chicken, but Olive Chicken could definitely make me change my mind. I popped by for lunch one day and had the two pieces with rice, salad, and a pop for $8. The chicken was delicious, nice and crispy without being too greasy. I had the sweet and spicy sauce (definitely more sweet than spicy) and it was good but I actually preferred it on the rice more than on the chicken. It's worth paying 75 cents to get a small serving of the sauce for your rice. Next time I plan to try the extra spicy sauce on the chicken. The salad is only really chopped iceberg with Italian style dressing. My only real complain is, why don't they have knives? They also have some type of desert style dish that someone else ordered that looked quite delicious.   I'll definitely be back for more chicken!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've gone to the original location on 10 av several times. Have been now to the new location (formerly Giant Hamburger) and nothing has changed in terms of quality. I feel the chicken is fresh and delicious. I wish they had wings specifically here but am happy with other options. If you like fried chicken you should try this place, as it is currently my favourite in the City, but the fries and onion rings are relatively average."}
{"text":"I made the trip after a particular craving one day, and some great Yelp reviews. I went for the regular crispy and hot & sweet. The lady at the front was very friendly.  The hot & sweet was tasty and very messy. I felt like I needed to wash my face after eating them. The regular crispy were indeed crispy, with a great flavor and juiciness. Good pricing and good portions added to the value of it. I look forward to returning again. And maybe again after that. Possibly a few more times after that."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late dine-in lunch with family. Placed our orders, the chicken was fried while we waited, and it arrived at our table plated attractively. It was crisp on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside--and much less greasy than I expected. My combo #1 of 3 pieces with (non-oily, non-soggy) fries and a can of ginger ale came to $7.99. One detail: the chicken is skinless, so even with the batter it's lower in fat than other fried chicken you'd normally get. Oddly, access to the washroom is through the food prep area--not ideal, unless you want to see chicken pieces being trimmed by hand. Otherwise, the place is bright and clean, and the service is quick, efficient, and cheerful. Solid value, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Crispy and tender juicy chicken best eaten straight out of the pan. Worst mistake you could do is take it home, let it go cold and soggy, then reheat. Just don't do it.  The hot and sweet sauce flavour has a spicier sweet chili taste to it, and though I'm not known for my tolerance to spice, I actually much prefer it to the original.   It's definitely one of the better chicken joints in Calgary. I shall be back."}
{"text":"I am a fried chicken connoisseur, so I am willing to try out any new place i find.  This is pretty good chicken, hands down better than KFC. Chicken was crispy but not dried out, and not greasy.  Personally, i found the coating a bit to \"bready\" without enough flavour- I don't think the breading had any spices or salt in it. The sweet chili dipping sauce is great to dip in though, spicy, sweet and really garlicy.  you can get the sauce on the chicken or on the side, I chose on the side as I am not a fan of soggy chicken...  I am still a fan of chicken on the way above Olive, but I would put Olive chicken over Mary Brown's, or Fritou. If you really like a thicker breading on your fried chicken, then this place is a good bet!  the pieces are larger and a reasonable price. Definitely worth a try, I will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fried chicken fan on the best of days, but Olive Chicken is such a nice departure from the norm that I couldn't resist. All the previous reviews are correct - Olive Chicken is delicious! Definitely get the Spicy Sweet sauce on your chicken, but if you like spicy I'd opt for the \"extra spicy\" option, as we didn't find it very spicy. The chicken came straight out of the fryer, and it was very lightly breaded, crispy, and juicy. The garlic and sweetness of the sauce makes this place an original.  The onion rings weren't awesome, but I've definitely had much worse in my day. Next time I'd opt for the poutine, as it's the same price and everyone seems to think it's really good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by a person I work with.  Since then I have been here 10 times.  I love the moistness of the white/dark chicken, the staff is friendly and it's way better than KFC.  The first time, I got the chicken in sauce, my hands were covered with sauce.  I now get the plain with a side of hot n sweet sauce.  You pull apart your chicken, dip it and you don't get your hands covered in sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious and EXACTLY what I was looking for! I was craving some really crispy, juicy chicken and after a quick Yelp search, found Olive Chicken. I had never heard of it or seen it, so I made it my mission to try it as soon as possible! Luckily, I've had two opportunities now and each time I was thoroughly satisfied. What a cute little place with a few tables and chairs, as well as some newspapers and magazines which I appreciated, as I was dining alone the first time! The sides (onion rings, veggie fries) are HUGE so you really only need one order for every 2-3 people...and the veggie fries are basically tempura vegetables. Still delicious though! I took my boyfriend back and we shared a 5 piece crispy chicken (with the hot & sweet sauce on the side) and both devoured it!! They use less spice than KFC or Chicken on the Way, but it is 100 times less greasy, and sooo juicy. Not to mention the price was awesome for the amount of food we got. The service here is also wonderful - they are very friendly and clearly know what they are doing. Love it & highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So went on Yelp to look for food and I found this restaurant. So I was eager to go here and try out their chicken. Their high rating really amazed me to try it. So I went and got the ginger soy fried chicken. It wasn't spicy. The chicken was somewhat sweet. But after eating second last piece, the chicken became super sweet. So for half a chicken its $13. The chicken was so crunchy that my left over piece that I bought home afterward was still crunchy (after couple hours later). Amazing.   As a tip get the half and half order. Choose two different kind of flavor. I feel that having just one flavor is very boring. But the first bite of the ginger soy fried chicken was very tasty.   Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pretty small restaurant (only 4 small tables) and simple menu but it's just as good as advertised. I don't usually like fried chicken because of the saltiness but this place had just the right amount of seasoning.   Ordered the half and half small which came with 5 pieces. Pretty big meal, next time if I come here alone I will just get a 3 piece. The hot and sweet pieces were decent but the original crispy was perfect. Added some ginger soy sauce to the original and I had to stop for a moment of silence (and picture) to salute this masterful meal."}
{"text":"yummy yummy fried chicken in my tummy. I was expecting some real soul style operations here. Turns out, the place is ran by two motherly looking  Korean ladies, in floral aprons and hair nets.  Makes sense, since this spot used to be Peoples (sp?) Koreak Bar & Lounge.  So being in an Asian establishment, I was entitled to ordering the orginal recipe fried chicken with rice. I also got the hot sweet sauce on the side which was nice, tasted like plum sauce x siracha.   The chicken peices were meaty, juicy and the batter was crunchy, light and well seasoned. I had no problems with it being too greasy, and as I bit into it, juicy chicken goodness dribbled out everywhere. It was a literal hot mess. Now that is juicy.  For less than $10 you can get 2 peices of chicken, rice, salad and a pop (they have Fanta btw). That's pretty darn good for a downtown proximity lunch. I can make it to this place and back in less than the standard allocated lunch hour. Park on the street because that parking lot is impossible to exit once you turn in.   If you are going to eat here, just know that the selling point of Olive chicken is the chicken. Not the ambiance. Lawn chair seating and mismatched lawn tables that wobble. Infact, it's freezing on colder days. They leave the door open to let out the grease in the air and let in bone chilling cold. They also don't seem to mind snow blowing horizontally inwards either. I did this. Twas dumb. But I would still eat here, maybe on a warmer day.  Review #7 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Korean  chicken soooo delicious!!!  Needed a quick dinner between appointments and decided to drop in.  Combo #1 - THREE pieces of chicken, and fries Combo #2 - TWO pieces of chicken, RICE and pickled veggies both include pop. I like the plain fried chicken over the sauced, tho if it were a combination that would be ok too for variety.  Don't get me wrong, the sauced chicken is good too but I was craving just plain fried chicken this day.   I'm also not sure how they would charge you for sauced chicken in these combos.  Chicken is soooo light and juicy it's definitely the place to go if you're craving fried chicken.  Inside decor is mom & pop...small, with a few small patio tables on window sides.   They should totally franchise!!! .... or have a few more in all quadrants of Calgary! :)"}
{"text":"It's passable. But I've never had anything at Olive that really impressed me. Last visit was a 3-piece with fries and it'll indeed be my last visit. Two piece that tasted like nothing and one that was incredibly gamey. Fries are of the McCain frozen variety and are the ultra-thin style, which I hate.  Then there is the atmosphere. It's an ugly, uncomfortable space. Staff are too often surly and refuse to return my effort to greet them in Korean, which rubs me the wrong way.  With the far superior Cluck N Cleaver a couple of blocks away and even though CnC isn't \"Korean Fried Chicken\" per se, it's still a vastly superior product."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place after hearing great things from friends. I ordered combo #1 sweet and spicy style - which is three pieces of chicken, a pop, and fries. It was absolutely delicious. Even with the sauce the chicken was still crispy and the inside was juicy and moist. I'm not much of a fried chicken gal but I have to say I will definitely be back for this chicken!  It's a small place with a few tables, friendly staff, and tasty fries too!"}
{"text":"Olive chicken is the best deep fried chicken in Calgary. Taste so good! Not greases at all!!! People are really Nice! Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"My husband says 5 star, I liked it, but found chicken could have more flavour and fries are good but not the best! Gravy was good too, but too far from home to even consider going often!! Chicken is not greasy which is a huge bonus!! And chicken pieces are reasonable size! They do deliver sometimes??"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is just one of the things I crave ALL the time, especially crispy fried chicken.  I have this love love relationship with fried chicken, there really isn't anything special about it....it's just that I love the crispy skin and then the tender chicken (mostly the skin). MMMMMM.  So I'm weird, and I when I'm craving something, sometimes I send a mass message out to friends and ask where the best _________ is.  This time, obvi it was fried chicken so I asked a few people.  KFC, Chicken-on-the-way, Fritou Chicken, Yum yum BBQ and Olive chicken were some of the places mentioned.  Olive chicken caught my eye.  I read reviews about this place, heard that it's Korean style fried chicken and really good so I decided to drag my sister and make the stop.    Olive chicken is downtown on 10th avenue SW, in a Korean strip mall area.  Parking is chaos as there is a grocery store nearby and some of the spots are reserved.  I parked on the street right across from Olive chicken as it was after 6PM.  When you walk in, there are menus displayed and the specials are written on a chalk boards.  There is a visible seating area but it is quite small.  I would imagine it gets busy and tight during the lunch hour!  Dani and I decided to go with the small hot & sweet sauce chicken (5 pieces) and went with the sauce on the side as some Yelpers suggested.  I reallllly wanted to try the poutine but we decided to go with the \"healthier\" alternative and ordered veggies............that are deep fried ;) haha ANYway, we were the only customers so our batch was hot and fresh straight from the fryer.  We took a seat, grabbed the fried chicken and took a bite. *CRUUUNCH*....mmmmmm that's exactly what I like to hear when I bite into fried chicken!  I found Olive chicken to be less greasy than some other places and I really enjoyed the crispiness of the chicken.  I'm happy I opted for the sauce on the side as it was OK...sweet with a hit of spiciness, some would enjoy but I like plain fried chicken (or with ketchup...See!! Weird I know...).  Dani mentioned it wasn't too greasy and the chicken was juicy...she enjoyed it. For the deep fried vegetables, they were lightly battered, slightly salted and very crispy.  The vegetables included onions, broccoli, carrots and kabocha squash, very tasty!  Olive chicken is a great place to get your fried chicken fix!  Next time I will try an Olive special with a side of poutine!!  Head over to Olive chicken if you're in the area...you won't be disappointed!  OH!  Rumor has it, they are opening another location on 17th avenue SW in the near future...YUM YUM YUM!  Mouthing OLIVE CHICKEN = I LOVE CHICKEN! Not sure if they were going for that but I thought it was so clever ^_^"}
{"text":"I had driven by Olive for years and then finally decided to try it. It's a little gem in the neighborhood.  Chicken is made to order fresh each time and is delicious."}
{"text":"Being a southern gal I've always been on a quest for truly good fried chicken. Olive Chicken has so far been the best fried chicken in Calgary for me. It's always hot, fresh and juicy. The staff are very friendly and the service is fast. I have found myself craving their chicken on most days. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"After reading Alex L. and Shaun B.'s reviews, I decided to make a quick run for the chicken myself, and even picked up some pieces for my co-workers.  In all honesty, I really really tried to get behind this chicken.  The operators, entrepreneurs from South Korea, are a friendly sort and offer good fast service.  The chicken seems to be double fried, pre-cooked once to get it a little crispy and ready for quick re-frying to lock in the crispness.  But... now that I've had it, all I really could think of was \"where's the seasoning\".  It was pretty bland over all, devoid of any especial taste except for the hot and sweet dipping sauce that came with it.  The crispy coating was actually quite light and not greasy at all, but again, quite bland.  The chopped garden salad was well, pretty basic at best being mostly iceberg and chopped carrots and cucumbers in a sweet cream dressing.  I skipped the fries and poutine on purpose to get the healthier fare, but I don't think I really missed much.  I don't know, being the son of immigrants and especially an immigration consultant, I really love to support such local businesses.  But now that I've had their chicken (which is supposedly cooked in olive oil), I'm really not sure if I might ever make an especial effort to get there (like today).  One co-worker told me that her leg was reaaaally over done and dry.  Then she noticed that the chicken pieces were skinless so their chicken was a good deal healthier than I thought.  So that's a double plus right there.    But still, if I'm in the area and want some fried chicken, I probably would go here for healthier ways of dealing with my cravings in such.  But if you really need the sauce that comes with it, and don't expect it to have especially good seasoning.    So to recap: Good - good crisp non-greasy chicken, no skin so healthier Bad - where's the seasoning?  Tip: Try out the $6.99 special (3 pieces with fries and pop, or 2 pieces with rice, salad and pop) as a great way of being intro'd to the food."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Korean BBQ chicken places in town.  Fast, friendly service to boot!  Make sure you try the sweet sauce chicken, much better than the plain one."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to love the chicken here, it's only alright. To be honest, Wow chicken in Chinatown is more reminiscent of Korean fried chicken. We got the couple combo which was ten pieces, fries, radish and two cans of pop. We ordered half and half crispy and garlic soy, which was an additional one dollar. The total about $30.  The wait was about 15 minutes, not too bad considering it's freshly made to order.  Upon first glance, it's looks pretty good. The fries are a mix of regular fries, onion rings, yam fries and two mushrooms. Pleasantly surprised with the variety. The crispy chicken is ok, nothing spectacular, the white meat is on the dry side; dark meat is good. Both white and dark meat of the garlic soy were moist and tender. I found the garlic soy on the sweet side; almost cloying.  Is the chicken double fried?  Doesn't really taste like it."}
{"text":"So, full disclaimer: before eating here, I went on a ten day silent meditation retreat. They only fed me vegetarian food. About half way through, I developed a hankering for fried chicken... and when I finished the retreat, Yelp led me here, to Olive Chicken.  And I'm so glad it did.  The Korean people are known for the quality of their fried chicken, and despite its modest appearance and very reasonable prices, Olive Chicken absolutely lives up to its country's reputation. Their chicken is AMAZING. I had the half and half -- regular crispy and hot&sweet. Both were so good that after five pieces, and despite being entirely full, I went back for two more. It is that good.  The only thing I'm sad about? It's that this place isn't closer to where I live. Because even with all the willpower built up from that silent meditation, I couldn't stop myself from coming back here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I never reviewed Olive Chicken before. BECAUSE I LOVE IT  I have often referred to it as \"The Korean Chicken on the Way,\" and if you know me, you know I love Chicken on the Way. (Case in point: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chicken-on-the-way-calgary#hrid:4PoIk1bIOPQs81XJjU5suQ/src:self)  The Sweet & Spicy Chicken (or YamYam as it is sometimes referred to on other menus) is amazing. To be honest, I haven't even tried anything else. I keep getting it. And getting it. And getting it. Again. And again. And Again.  The last time I went, I got two pieces (breast and thigh), left, ate it ... then came back and ordered two more.  It's that good. It is tender, crunchy, sweet and mildly spicy. It is incredibly delicious. In fact, I'm so hungry now, I am going again right after I finish this review. \"POST\""}
{"text":"This place delivers on its promise of yummy chicken.  I ordered the 3pc combo which came with fries and a pop.  Not going to lie-I devoured the whole meal!  The cashier was nice enough to offer to make 2 pcs hot and sweet and 1 crispy.  I enjoyed the plain but loved the saucy kind!  Just the right balance of heat and sweet!"}
{"text":"Winner, winner chicken dinner. Is Korean Fried Chicken the new explosive trend? I am gonna say no, but it is delicious and affordable compared to Mr. Sanders.  Your chicken is also ready ten thousand times faster than a 10 piece bucket at KFC is.  The chicken was crispy and not dripping with grease, I wasn't huge on the spicy sauce, so am glad I ordered it on the side to dip at whim. I took Paul G.'s tip and had my salt shaker at the ready prior to consumption. We also ordered onion rings, which were nice, but it amounts to over indulgence of fried foods otherwise.  I do love how you get daikon radish, that was a delicious bonus treat amidst the chicken carcass gorging.  But please, for the safety of your precious vehicle, do not park in this parking lot or you will be immediately boxed in and or backed into."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through one of those sites and our chicken arrived warm and delicious.  We tried the crispy, soy ginger, sweet and spicy, and extra spicy.  The extra spicy wasn't that hot, but the flavour was nice.  The crispy was definitely delicious.   We also ordered a side of pickled radish which was nice and refreshing to go with the chicken.  We will definitely get chicken from here again, the price rivals KFC too."}
{"text":"brought my mom here for lunch yesterday, and we shared the 2 piece (sweet & spicy) with rice & salad, and added on Fries & onion rings.  Service was fast & the staff was nice. Food was delicious! Mom said to 'tell Yelp your mom gives Olive Chicken two thumbs up!'"}
