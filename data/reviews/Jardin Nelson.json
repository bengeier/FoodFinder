{"text":"Not exactly the small, quiet, non-touristy place I was looking for. But the profusion of flowers, the trees, multi-level seating, live jazz, and gigantic umbrellas/sunshades won me over. And my Du Jardin vegetarian crepe was very tasty. The sangria was great for a warm evening. It was very busy but I only waited a short time for a table. The servers were busy but I was happy to take my time. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in and were expecting a normal, tourist experience - overpriced average food.  We were surprised at the high quality of the food and service and great atmosphere in the garden.  Not a great menu for kids, however they enjoyed a pizza and though the jazz music was nice since it reminded them of the movie La La Land."}
{"text":"Abordable et l'ambiance extra- un endroit idéal entre très bons amis(es).- J'adore les crêpes de nature confondue avec la musique it is the Best.- Adepte depuis plusieurs décennies..."}
{"text":"Recently re-visited after coming here once for dinner 3 years ago. The terrace was lovely and the atmosphere was great. However the veggie options on the menu were much more limited than I remember (2 pizzas and one crepe). Firstly was told that the \"poulette sauce\" was vegetarian but further questioning revealed that they actually did use \"chicken powder\" to make it. Not good! Crepes were sub-standard, as was the pizza. 4 meals and all were poor/okay. Food was not cold, but not as hot as you would expect it to be coming straight from the kitchen. Would not recommend for the food- definitely better to had!"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem best place in old Montreal. Awesome atmosphere awesome food."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend.  Lovely place, the live jazz was great background music and the terrace was beautiful.  We came here for breakfast and got the meat lovers pizza and a nelson crepe, definitely one of the nicer places to dine in Montreal near the Old Port.  Had a bit of a romantic feel to it. There are heaters in case you want to sit outside on a cooler day.  Lots of trees and flowers, the Jazz band is situated in the center of the restaurant so everyone can see them while dining.  The service was fast and polite.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Montreal for the weekend...did an entire day of biking, sightseeing, etc and needed to wind down after a nice dinner. Enter Jardin Nelson! What a cute, quaint little restaurant! I can only speak for drinks and dessert...excellent! The waitress was super nice (and spoke English) and very knowledgable about the drinks and dessert. We had the porthouse sangria which was awesome and the pudding. The pudding was a tad sweet- very maple-y but balances nicely with the vanilla ice cream. A definite plus? The house jazz band played while diners dined! The inside (which is actually outside) is heated. Sooooo nice. Would come back if I ever escape the city again!"}
{"text":"Good environment, nice and friendly staff, lovely live jazz band! The menu is basic, not over complicated! Highly recommended for summer season!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty (tuna tartare, shrimp salad, 4 cheese pizza and chocolate sundae dessert).  Waiter was attentive, didn't have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I went to Jardin Nelson on a Friday at lunch.  There can be a bit of line, but the wait wasn't too bad.  This place is worth the visit for the ambiance alone! A beautiful courtyard patio with canopies and, trees and flowers and a jazz combo played in the not so background.   We shared the nachos ($15) for starters and they were very yummy and cheesy.  My father kept commenting on the cranberry salsa.  My mother started with the French Onion Soup and said it was the best she had ever had. I had the UnBeetable salad and found it filling and delicious. I also ordered a 16 oz pitcher of White Sangria.  It was GREAT!  So yummy on a warm afternoon and great to share with a friend.  My 3-year-old was nicely welcomed and given crayons and a paper.  She had the pancakes (other choices for kids were limited to pasta or pizza).   A place I will return to."}
{"text":"A local recommended this place to us while we were on vacation to Montreal. In the heart of tourist Montreal, this restaurant attracted hundreds. In fact, on a Monday night, we had a 30 min wait to be seated, and we arrived there around 10pm. Inside, the patio is absolutely beautiful, you feel like you're in Europe's backyard - trees and flowers everywhere, awesome jazz music, and the buzz of people everywhere. We expected something great, but I gotta say it was nothing but average. The waitress seemed unhappy and tired, we had to constantly keep asking for water refills, the food took forever to be brought out. there was a sizeable period of time where our waitress disappeared.  The food was okay, we had the lobster salad - that was a treat. Absolutely delicious, fresh greens, and the grape and pineapple really made it fresh. I had the Diva crepe, it was okay, nothing memorable. And the rib sandwich, also okay.   For dessert we had the banana chocolate crepe. When we asked for dessert the waitress looked exasperated. Again we waited forever. It was sweet, but nothing as exciting as what we expected. A packed restaurant, yet the food was just alright."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, however there was a wait to sit back there when we came here at 7ish on a weeknight. We tried the \"dinner\" crepes because they seemed to be the restaurants specialty. The crepes themselves were very tasty however the filling was subpar."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes in a quaint courtyard setting in between the buildings. I got the diva crepe, which was a savory affair with cheese, chicken, broccoli and a bechamel sauce of some sort. It tasted great! The crepe was done well, and gave off that freshly baked scent with every bite, as the ingredients oozed out.   I also got a glass of the house lemonade (lemonade maison), which was an interesting take on lemonade. I think they mixed lemon juice with soda water, and then blended it with bits of basil! It was a very refreshing taste, with a hint of herbal fragrance and a slight bitterness from the soda.  The other half of the joy of dining here is the atmosphere. The courtyard is a really amazing place to sit. There are flowers planted on the walls surrounding it, and off-center, there was a little water feature. A live jazz duo (comprising a bassist and a pianist) was playing when I got there."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average - this is a touristy part of town and everything is pretty expensive. We sat on the front terrace - the back was really loud with the live music. We enjoyed people watching and had good service. The food was good but nothing terribly memorable."}
{"text":"Our visit to this wonderland of cheese was quite possibly the highlight of my friends' and my recent visit to Montreal. Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!  We tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the \"pudding chomeur,\" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!  The service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party \"start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,\" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones.   Overall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Quite the popular tourist trap in the old port! Only open a few months a year, the best time to visit, in my opinion, is when the line isn't miles long! Reservations unfortunately aren't a possibility.   The actual location and spot is beautiful, complete with a live jazz band soundtrack to accompany your meal. Huge, and quite intricate umbrellas cover overhead and brick walls fill in the remainder. I must say, in Montreal, this is one of the sickest places to visit.  However, the food is alright despite their array of options. I do believe there is something for everyone. That being said, everytime I've been, I've never been truly impressed, then again I may be setting my expectation too high. The drink list, on the other hand, is rad-especially for summer drinks.  If you're willing to accept the long line, possibly and probably slow service due to low staff and crowd, you will have a great time! Cute spot!"}
{"text":"Because it's in Place Jacques Cartier, you'd think that this place is super expensive, and in general intimidating. But it's not! The prices are reasonable, and the food is good. There was music playing in the background too, and it was overall a very enjoyable experience.  The -1 star is for the ambiance. It's kind of too loud for my liking, and it was hard to carry on a conversation without shouting. We were seated right next to the musicians though."}
{"text":"Very chic. Located really well. Nice view of everything that is going on if you're seated in the front. The wait is a little long. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"We had a lunch here. We ordered Rabbit Saddle Crepe, Duck Shepherd Pie and Pets de Soeur for desert. The food was delicious. Service was ok despite the fact that restaurant was full. This is definitely a place to come back. Small touches as maps with welcome phrases in many languages and napkins with restaurant name are adding to the overall thoughtful decor."}
{"text":"We polled three different concierges at the Marriott about their favorite dining choices and this name came up three out of three times, so off we went.  While the food was tasty, I suspect the recommendations were more because of their location (most happening/touristy part of Old Montreal) than their cuisine.  VIP card from the concierge got us a little bit of special treatment, they were very busy even though once again it was around 10 o'clock by the time we decided to have dinner.  The French Onion Soup served there is HUGE and should definitely be shared unless you want to make it your entire meal.  The Crepe Florentine was very rich, the filling was just right but the batter was sweeter than I think a savory crepe calls for.  We also ordered the Pate Chinois (duck layered with sweet corn and mashed potatoes) which sounds exotic but really tastes a lot like shepherd's pie.  Decent prices, good band, good drinks...but not a culinary awakening"}
{"text":"Good food, nice setting, jazz ambience.  Made for a great evening."}
{"text":"My daughter and I loved this place, so much so that we went there twice in one weekend--once for a late lunch/early dinner and once for brunch on Sunday. Everything we ordered was wonderful--colorful, tasty, fresh. Other meals ordered by other people looked tempting, too. The cheesecake crepe with strawberries was light and delicious. My daughter said her Mojito was the best she ever had. We were lucky and timed it well when we arrived. No wait either time. The light jazz was even ok for a twenty-something who enjoyed the plants surrounding us. Service was timely and polite, but we would not have cared how long it took to bring the food. We loved the ambience and could have stayed there all day."}
{"text":"We came here on a hot day and sitting outside over the kitchen was a bit much.  This is a large place created behind facet of the Old Town.  It has an interesting overlapping set of huge inverted umbrellas to shield diners from rain.  Menu is kind of nouvelle Quebec cuisine.  We started with chicken mousse, caprese, smoked fish and fried calamari.  Few of us chose crepe.  I had a duck casserole topped with potato slices.  Wine was a Bordeaux red following cooling local beer on a hot day.  While food was ok, waiting staff was inexperienced and we had to wait quite a while between courses and a few item was missed."}
{"text":"Very happy to have stumbled upon this brunch place.  LIve band, nice outdoor area, and good food."}
{"text":"Excellent location and lovely garden atmosphere with live jazz entertainment. We enjoyed a relaxing dinner.  Fermiere crepe, with veal and vegetables in an herb sauce, was delicious. The French onion soup was also very good. The menu was large enough that everyone in our party found something they liked. Waiter was friendly and service was excellent. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food!!! Really must visit destination in old Montreal!!! The lobster sandwich is excellent, fresh, light and very tasty!! Atmosphere is nice! Staff friendly and professional!!!"}
{"text":"LookWonderful spot  for brunch with girl friends right in the heart of old Montreal. The live jazz band sets the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place; fantastic patio and the prices seem fair.  Sitting out front is also pleasant in the sunshine as the back patio is almost all shade.  So many tourist traps around this area, we found this one listed in Frommer's and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Stunning decor, live jazz music, and delicious brunch fare. This is absolutely one of my favourite brunch spots.  This restaurant is the perfect marriage between outdoor and indoor dining. The decor is simply stunning - the unusual giant umbrellas, the potted plants and flowers, and the exposed brick create a whimsical and romantic environment.  To eat I had the bacon breakfast crepe. It was heavenly! The crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety, but it definitely works. It's still light and soft, and the hint of sweetness works so well with the salty bacon and savoury cheese and eggs. Just writing this review makes my stomach growl.  If you're looking for a great brunch spot in Old Montreal definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here early on a Friday evening and had no problem getting a table. We sat in the back courtyard, which had a great atmosphere - a really intimate feel and off the busy main square of Old Montreal. Since we were traveling with our toddler, being outdoors was perfect, and the wait staff was very accommodating.   I had the chicken and broccoli crepe and really enjoyed it. My husband had a bacon and apple crepe which was also good. The white sangria was excellent and seemed like  a popular drink as most tables had the same.   I'd recommend going early if you don't want to wait. When we were leaving there was a long line for both the front of the restaurant and the back courtyard. Definitely a popular place in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"An otherwise great evening turned cold...literally.  On a beautiful autumn night, the large patio was atmospherically lit and despite it being a bit cool, the outdoor heaters were on full blast allowing guests to comfortably enjoy dinner outside listening to a live jazz band.    This is worth noting because of what follows.  In serving our entrees, the waitress accidentally knocked over a full glass of ice water on my dad's lap. My dad (who's in his mid 70's), did not make a huge fuss however he was quite cold the rest of the evening and obviously rather uncomfortable sitting in a pair of corduroys that were soaked through.  The waitress apologized profusely and as water had spilled on his entrée as well, she had the kitchen make a new order.  However when the bill came, I expected to see some sort of acknowledgement of the inconvenience....right?  Wrong.  Fully charged for every item ordered.  I was completely shocked.  I eat out a lot and when accidents happen, the establishment usually backs their staff up somehow - desserts on the house, drinks or at the very least, the dinner of the person this happened to.  My dad chose to give her the full 15% tip which I would've agreed with had this incident been acknowledged but nothing was - hence the review.  Food was good.  Atmosphere was good. Customer relations = 0.  Surprising given that the restaurant is located in a tourist area where you would think customer service and hospitality are of utmost importance.  But then again, it's obvious that these guys are not looking to nurture return business in any way nor are they concerned about competitive business.  I for one, will not be back and will not offer a recommendation.  Montreal has a TON of fantastic restaurants in great neighbourhoods all around the city - there is certainly nothing here that can't be enjoyed elsewhere where the level of customer appreciation is exercised and shown at a level befitting the establishment and its' environs."}
{"text":"My party consisted of 1 local, 1 immigrant, and 3 tourists but all were well-pleased by the atmosphere, service, and food/drink.  The Jardin is a bit pricey, consistent with other restaurants in Old Montreal, but well worth it due to portion size and quality of the food.  I had the Duck Confit Shepard's Pie and was very pleasantly surprised with how fresh and incredible the dish was.  My wife had the Salmon Lasagna in Bolognese sauce which was equally fantastic (the Salmon was plentiful and the flavor even could be identified in just the sauce).  The three tourists each had a different type of savory crepe, of which the Veal (Farmer's crepe) was widely acknowledged to have been the best of the three (other were duck confit and Basilico chicken).  Overall it was a great experience which I'm sure my family will not forget and my wife and I will repeat on our own.  I highly recommend sitting in the rear garden; I'm sure the entire restaurant is very nice, but it simply cannot compare with the stunning open-air space and live music found on the rear terrace."}
{"text":"This is not a place for great food! Nope! But its one of my favorite places for the summer terrace drinks! Live music, old port, beautiful greenery- just breathtaking!"}
{"text":"I suggested this place to my brother to have brunch with guests after his courthouse wedding, and reserved a table three months prior to the big day. I also made sure to call a day before to confirm and remind them that this was for a wedding party. When we arrived we were seated by the hostess at a nice table overlooking the garden. We brought a small cake and were informed that it would be ok to eat it after we had brunch. A few minutes later, the waitress returned and informed us that the management hasn't decided yet, if that part of the restaurant will be serviced that morning, and wanted to seat us at a different table, in a darker and less attractive section, far away from flowers and the music. After some back and forth, I convinced her that we would prefer to stay at the nice table; and a moment later they did indeed  open that section.  Ten minutes later, the manager passed by, a rude middle-aged women. She saw the cake on the table and started yelling at the waitress in French, explaining that it was against their policy to allow outside food. When bride and groom got visibly upset, I asked the manager to be a bit accommodating and speak to us in a polite and professional manner. She didn't change her attitude and made us pack the cake again. By then, the bunch was spoilt. No words of apologies, no smile, no congratulations. It was a very disappointing experience, and I feel bad that I recommended this place to my brother for his big day. Brides and grooms to be, be warned, stay away from Jardin Nelson."}
{"text":"O lugar é incrível!!!!! Muito lindo todo arborizado com música ao vivo de fundo!! A comida e bem gostosa as ribs de entrada são ótimas! Não vá esperando comer rápido nem barato  Mas vale muito a pena!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, open air but under tents. Great menu and drinks. \"Jazz\" live music, not to overwhelming. Nice wait staff."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an lovely evening on the Jardin Nelson terrace...listening to their house jazz band and enjoying our drinks and dessert.  Great location in the heart of Old Montreal.  Although you're probably paying more for the convenience of being in the the tourist area but a nice venue.  Didn't look at dinner options or prices but two desserts and a pitcher of Sangria set us back $37 Canadian.   The garden terrace is cool and inviting, location is very convenient.  Jazz was also pretty good for a house band on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"I was just tooling around Old Montreal, and I wanted to visit this place because of the live jazz and the outdoor seating.  It was in October, and the flowers were still abloom.  I ordered a pineapple daiquiri, and it was good, but the texture was off.    I ordered a crepe with ham, cheese, and asparagus.  It was huge, fresh, and delicious.  I took a chance and ordered the strawberry cheesecake crepe as dessert.  It was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again.  It was just something different, and I wanted to stay around longer for the great, open atmosphere and the lovely jazz.  They aren't the best crepes around, but the food along with the location and ambiance would keep me coming back (if I lived in Montreal)."}
{"text":"Quality restaurant with good food and great environment. Amazing waitress, wouldn't stop smiling. A definite must for those visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. The live jazz music band really helps your experience and you feel like you're in a little garden (you have the choice to eat in the garden or at the terrace). There is a wide and interesting selection of drinks that you can choose from. I took as an appetizer the flaky with creamy goat cheese and it was delicious. As the main dish I took a forester crepe and my girlfriend chose the cannellonis. Both of them were really good. As dessert we took the orange tiramisu and it was OK but could taste more 'orangee'. The waiter was really welcoming and the service was good. I would recommend this place to anyone if they are willing to pay a bit more than usual because it is a bit pricey (we are at the old port after all!).  I will definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Very romantic spot in Old Montreal. Ask for seating in the back \"courtyard garden.\" Live jazz quartet entertained us & added to the ambience & they were very good! Lovely & delightful garden setting on all of the levels of the terraces with lightly running water, full-growth trees, accent lighting & very pleasant atmosphere. Food was delicious! French onion soup was the best we've ever had, tomato bisque soup was tasty with fresh herbs, crepes were very tasty (including buckwheat & hemp flour) with a large choice of fillings. They graciously switched & gave me their homemade tomato sauce since I don't like any white sauces. Pitcher of \"sangria\" was very good, but a tad too sweet for our palates. If Jardin Nelson was in my hometown, I'd dine there every week! We loved it!"}
{"text":"meh. Had lunch there last Saturday. I was looking forward to the place based on the reviews but was disappointed. The food was not bad, but not worthy of high praise. It was overpriced, as the restaurant is located in a high tourist area. The service was minimal.    It was nice to sit on a patio on a nice day, but next time I will try a different place. I feel no need to go back there."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Good live music. No wait on a saturday at 1pm. Recommended. The roast beef sandwich was underwhelming though--order something besides the roast beef. Pizza and nachos looked good."}
{"text":"In our brief visit to Montreal, we were able to have lunch at this delightful restaurant.  It had been recommended by a friend who asked us to google upside down umbrellas!    The patio is cleverly designed, and extremely peaceful feeling, despite the live jazz band and the buzzing audience.  The jazz ensembles were talented and we were able to sit and listen to two groups on a weekday afternoon.  Though there is a small wasp issue on the patio, I had a wonderful lunch.  Plus, the sangria is great!"}
{"text":"Located on the corner 407 Jacques Cartier Place, Old Montreal has a 4/5 star rating consistently on different google sites. I loved the place. A cozy back patio enclosed in old buildings with different terrace levels and an un-enclosed evening sky, the place feels European magical. A jazz band plays on a raised stage off to one side and the tables are intimate and romantic. The menu fans food fare that's French, Italien et un Autre category. I had the vegetarian crepe with kalamata olives, green and red peppers, goat cheese and onion, fabulous! The crepe itself was good, I prefer it slightly lighter and softer but overall it was great. Cooked well, the dish came with a fennel salad, that I thought was a great pairing. The service was good and the atmosphere romantic but fun. I would definitely recommend this place. The price was good too. With two drinks and two crepes and a bruschetta appetizer the bill was $66 and change. My experience was 4 star."}
{"text":"This is always one of my go-to places for brunch in Montreal - everything from the quality of food, to service, to ambience is amazing, especially in the summer. They have a garden feel, making it seem like you are away from the city. The staff are always pleasant and the food one of the best in the city - will never stop coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful historic restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal. However, it brought disappointment.  Pros: - Very beautiful, great location, live music - Nice waitress who tries to help although with less fluent English  Cons - Small birds flying everywhere in the garden. Everyone worries the dropping will drop into their dishes, although everyone probably loves birds in nature.  - MEDICORE dishes. We ordered 3 different items, only salad turned out to be OK. Even pizza does not taste good.  - Rude waiter. When I asked for 1 minute to get my family from outside restaurant to the table in the garden, the reply was \"I cannot trust you, and we have limited space\".  And the waiter clean the table setting and \"invite me out\".  We did come back in 1 minute. -- I won't call the waiter a LIAR, but there were 10+ open tables during my entire stay there.  - Entitlement of tips, which was the highlight, and quite amusing. A small notice was given along with the bill to every customer, saying \"outstanding service\" deserves 15% tips.   Tips are to be earned, and customers, not the restaurant, are in the position to judge the quality of service.  In a word, nice to see the place, but unpleasant to dine!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place in Old Montreal! We had crepes sitting on the terrace and it was a great experience! There were pretty flowers everywhere and our crepes were delish! Check this place out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"A gorgeous space to feast your eyes/ears in  Old Montreal in Summer.   Highly recommended for late night drinks/dessert with live jazz.  The full brunch thing, not so much.    Basically, the problem is that the food just isn't that good.  Then again, its the atmosphere that's magical.  Solution:  go at 11pm and get an (expensive, but good) drink and enjoy the beautiful space."}
{"text":"The food is good, the ambiance is wonderful. So, what made me give this place just two stars? It was the service.  We went there for brunch during this labor day weekend. We were attended to by our waiter, Kevin (at least that was the name on our bill). The moment we sat at the table he acted as if we encroached upon his free time. Towards the end we ordered coffee. He got us two cups, we politely refused one and took just one cup (I am pretty sure I ordered just one cup). Me and wife shared coffee from that one cup as we always do. He saw that, walks towards us and declares that we cannot share our coffee since we sent the other cup back. Really?   One of the worst attitudes I have seen. Hey, I could have paid for that second cup, I would rather pay $3 than listen to some snark comments.   My recommendation: good place to visit but bad personnel."}
{"text":"Enthusiastic thumbs up! We sat outside in lovely weather and the service was very friendly. The menu is very extensive, lots of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and crepes.   Definitely recommend the CINQ FROMAGES PIZZA. If you're in a pizza mood, get it. You won't regret it, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten in my life.   Spinach salad with strawberries and maple dressing was very nice and light and sweet. The goat cheese pastry appetizer was also fantastic.  Heard this place is a bit of a \"tourist trap\" and I can say that as a tourist I did get trapped by this place and it was totally worth it. Best food I've had so far in Montreal!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for lunch on our recent trip to Montreal. My dad and I split the Cartier \"Salad\" and the Baked Cannelloni. The \"salad\" was supposed to include a variety of ingredients, but it came to the table looking like a sad bowl of pasta with a few token bits of mango and sun dried tomato. The baked cannelloni was tasty in comparison, but the meat had an unappetizing gray color. However, my mom ordered a ham and asparagus crepe which she thoroughly enjoyed. In my opinion, Jardin Nelson should cut their Cheesecake Factory sized menu down to the one thing they do well: crepes."}
{"text":"Didn't go for dinner. Went for dessert and live jazz. The musicians were great! The dessert was terrible, chocolate taste watery and fake. I was so sad. Frozen mango rum was good but not amazing. The ambience is beautiful!! I love gardens."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is fantastic for several reasons, the first of which is that it's one of the cheaper joints in vieux-Montreal.  It was hot on the sun-baked cobblestone main path and I was aching to sit and enjoy a french style brunch and JN delivered beautifully. We sat in the back garden, and we were instantly cooled by the shade and breeze the architecture of the inner eaterie. It's beautiful, with lots of garden plants and stone walls, well lit and your meal is accompanied by jazz music (sometimes live as when I went!).  The waitresses are cute and friendly, and can obv accommodate if you only speak english. The menu is somewhat sparse, but what's on there is made with a delicate and professional touch; all of our food was top notch and delicious. I had the house crepe, a friend had the rabbit and another the scallopene. We relaxed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery and heartily recommend the jardin Nelson to both tourists and locals alike.   Prices are btwn $15-25/person."}
{"text":"The ambience for the most part is great, as is everywhere in Old Montreal. Food is below average and service is below average especially for the price you pay. Heat lamps are not very attractive from where we were seated as well. Ill never be back."}
{"text":"We have been to this place every time we have come to Montreal and have never been disappointed.  This time around we came with our 11 month old daughter and the servers were curious and wonderful in preparing food that she can eat.  As to the grown ups, I highly recommend the lobster salad, the seafood crepe and the duck crepes...although we have yet to get anything we haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good but the quality of the food changed the crepes look like they r filled with junk , my crepe florentine was filled with a white sauce and mushrooms hard like bones and the goat feuilletee starter looked frozen and defrosted because the goat was half melted , too bad because the ambience and setting are good and the service very fast !"}
{"text":"I would have probably given this restaurant all 5 stars, had it been just my husband and I dining. But we visited Jardin Nelson with our young son. From the get-go, our waiter was rude about everything that had to do with our son. We asked for a side of roasted potatoes, but apparently they couldn't be separated from the roast beef sandwich. Then the waiter brought our son cold pasta. The manager was quick to try to fix the situation and even brought us dessert on the house. All three of us really enjoyed the atmosphere, the live jazz and the outdoor seating. The bacon and apple crepe, and sangria were delicious. It's too bad this place is not child-friendly."}
{"text":"This place is unique because you are sitting outside in a garden that is covered when it is raining, the food was alright but it was over priced and there are very limited options for vegetarians, and almost none for vegans.  I know this isn't the right town for a vegetarian or a vegan but they could add a few more options for us. I am giving them 3 stars for the atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant that I definitely recommend! Despite the service being a bit slow, the food was on point! I ordered the nachos as an appetizer. It was a huge, delicious portion with lots of cheese and chips. I'll definitely order this again. For my entree, I had their crepe du Jardin. It was a bit small, but scrumptious as well. I'll surely return to eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing. We were seated in a timely manner considering the lunch crowd, and the waiter were always available. The food was Amazing!!! Mind blowing and you can taste the quality of ingredients. The atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining and it was a beautiful day out. Even if its seasonal im definetly waiting and going next summer and telling everyone i know to go as well!"}
{"text":"This is our first time in Montreal and we were so glad we kept walking around the area to land at this restaurant. We had no wait for two of us, our server was friendly and prompt, the ambiance and jazz music was outstanding, and the food was delicious.   Another note, as someone who eats vegetarian, it was hard finding a spot in that area that had any meatless options on the menu. Jardin Nelson was a success and has a variety of savory crepes with tons of veggies and great flavors.   Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here 4 years ago and I loved it! The atmosphere and food was great! So when we decided to visit Montreal again, I made sure that we will go to this place again and we did! I ordered the same food I ordered 4 years ago and it was as good as I remembered it. I have tried the same food in other restaurants and it was not the same. It didn't even come close! A must see when you go to the Old Port in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but nothing special. It has a huge outdoor patio with love jazz, which was quite good the night we were there. Tried the French onion soup, which was good, but not special. That was kind of our reaction to everything we had.. Tasty, but not special. The wait staff, although helpful was not attentive enough to fill out water glasses more than once and made it clear that when we were done ordering, they were ready for us to move along. Definitely meant for the yours crowds along the square, and fine for what it was, but you'll do better somewhere else"}
{"text":"Loved everything about our experience at this restaurant, the music, the flowers, the heat lamps.  There is a video on YouTube of the restaurant parasols being opened at the start of a day.  Absolutely incredible.  My husband I each had a crepe.  I don't remember which ones but remember they were tasty. We shared a pitcher of the Apple Cider Sangria which I highly recommend. It's built on a white wine and high quality apple cider.  Great option for those who don't favour red wine.  We'll definitely eat there again the next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"It has been a while but my only experiences with this place have been resoundingly tourist-trappy  It is a lovely place to sit so I would go back for that.  but they have an extremely high-profit meny of crepes and pizza and crappy salads so that they make a whole lot of money selling you flour.  If you are in the old port and want a glass of beer and live music go here.  For a good meal go to china town or to Amir's or something.  Do not fall into the tourist trap!"}
{"text":"11/10 would recommend!!!! I ate the chicken curry crepe it was great. Service was beautiful and the wait was not long! It may look long but it's not really. Also the Jazz band was bumping!   ARRET YOU MUST COME HERE!  A haiku: Crepes are really great I have had bigger cookies But it was still great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very pretty place. You're kind of outdoors but with a tent like ceiling with jazz playing.   I had a crepe...which was plain...I thought they were known for their crepes but all crepes looked plain. I should have gotten what my friend had...the egg dish...which looked like it was in a casserole...MMmmm  I was eying some guy who got a HUGE French onion soup. It looked like twice the normal size. Should have gotten one. Get that French Onion Soup!!!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant ou il fait bon d'y allez... Autant pour un dîner d'affaires ou un souper d'amoureux tout ça accompagné d'un band Jazz live... Une belle carte et je vous conseille une bonne pizza végétarienne :) qui tant qu'à moi est sublime :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled in here while strolling around Old montreal and being too lazy to walk back to the Quartier Latin (too much time at Le Distellerie the night prior).  Of course, this was the best service we'd had our entire trip.  Would have been a gem if there was food to match. They boast about the crepes, except each one has about 9,000 ingredients in them, which don't always seem to be good sign.  Think bad diner meets French Canadian in Times Square.  The combinations in the crepes didn't seem to be too well thought out.  We started with a goat cheese soufle which was over proccessed goat cheese in a very, very dry pastry shell with tomato sauce doused over it.  Literally tomato sauce, not pasta sauce, but straight up, out of the can type of sauce.  I honestly don't remember the entrees except that they weren't that great.  Again, service was so, so good and super friendly. If you're in Old Montreal, skip all of the restaurants and walk a few blocks to Chinatown even.  I wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"This place is a joy to live across the street from. On a regular basis, Jardin Nelson pipes in delicious smells and beautiful jazz music directly into my apartment, which compel me to visit it again and again.  If you're looking to impress a couple of friends or relatives, this restaurant is IT."}
{"text":"BEWARE. Lots of birds and bugs flying around. Food was okay, waiter (Sebestian) was very accommodating, but my appetite went down when the leaves are falling down from the canopy .... Will not be back."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best dining experience I have ever had. The service was courteous and prompt. The dining room is located in a repurposed alley way in old Montreal and absolutely gorgeous as all of the restaurant is located outside save for the kitchen. No need to worry in the rain because they have a canopy which protects all the diners from the elements. They have a varied and exceptional drink menu I had a martini that was made with orange peel gin and champagne and was incredible. We started with an order of the nachos which were absolutely delicious, the fresh made salsa included cranberries and were a delicious compliment. Next I had one of their dinner crepes which had chicken and was delicious, well seasoned and well portioned. The meal ended with a cheese cake and was divine! Definitely check this place out. Lastly they had a live jazz band that really set the mood for this wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance--plants, lights, and an orchestra playing all night. The food was okay. We had the lobster salad, chicken wings, shrimp, and the salmon and eggplant lasagna. Although very heavy, the salmon lasagna was great. The lobster salad was too saucy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really lively and fun. Coloured lights shine down on sections of diners seated at different heights.  Huge umbrellas loom overhead.  It's quite a unique space.  Live music plays at night.  The appys were very tasty.  That was my first time having crepes for dinner."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson came up as one of the recommended places for brunch on our trip to Montreal. The place itself is very beautiful, the ambiance is lovely and the Jazz playing in the background makes it a perfect weekend brunch setting.   The downside - both the dishes that we ordered were bland. We were warned that the food is not what people go o Jardin Nelson for. The service also was very poor. It wasn't very busy when we were there but it took our server forever to get water.   It's good to check out on a visit to Montreal but we'd never go back again!"}
{"text":"On y va pour la terrasse en été ou pour écouter du jazz ou de la musique classique pas très loin.  C'est pour les touristes et il y a tellement mieux ailleurs à Montréal et souvent à quelques pas."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Is like a piece of heaven/paradise.  The setup surrounded by the beautiful flowers, trees and umbrellas, the live music and  possibly the best white wine sangria on earth....  Nothing bad to say, I love this place that much.  We usually travel from  Toronto a couple weekends during the summer just for spending an afternoon here.... Yes the drive is worth  every time :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! amazing service, food, music and atmosphere! I will definetely come back :)"}
{"text":"After a day of sightseeing, we were looking for something a bit different with a little local flavor... and Jardin Nelson definitely fit the bill. Interesting crepes - our family of 5 each had a different crepe and we took turns tasting each other's dish. All were excellent. A three-piece jazz band was playing in the courtyard. Great ambience. Crepes were about $15 each. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Drinks look good but haven't tried them. Great live jazz."}
{"text":"Pro: lovely building.  Cons: Pricier than Yelp says it is (entrees $17-30), nothing for kids despite Yelp telling you it's \"kid friendly\" (you can special order a cheese pizza for only $17), snotty service (yes, even by Montreal standards), and the less said about the greasy, bland, half-hearted dishes the better. I have no idea how this place is so highly rated on Yelp. It's really misleading given how many wonderful restaurants there are in town."}
{"text":"Ambiance is wonderful for weekend brunch. There's plenty of outdoor patio seating fully equipped with umbrellas that catch rain and heaters / fans. Unfortunately the food was nothing to write home about. It was okay but nothing great compared to all the wonderful choices in Montreal. Come here for drinks and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Obviously you gonna fall in love with the ambiance...   Their food is really average, but drinks are unique :)  Negative point: I asked if they can warm up my bread, the guy said no."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Live music, insane crepes, birds fluttering about the place, open air atmosphere, super romantic.  Every time I'm in Montreal I come here cause it's amazing.  Cheesecake crepe is a must-have!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the positives.  This place is absolutely beautiful.  There are flowers all over. It's outdoors, but unique canopies are strategically placed so that when it rains no water will land in the area.  The live jazz music they have every night and during Saturday, Sunday and holiday brunch is really lovely.  Even the dishes are plated very nicely.  Now for the unfortunate negatives... I came here for dessert only, and we ordered a chocolate banana crepe and an apple maple syrup crepe.  The first tasted fine but was crunchy...and the second just wasn't good at all.  They were both cold."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson can be found in the Historic square of Old Port Montréal. (Place Jacques-Cartier, 407 Place Jacques Cartier, Montréal).I must say, every time I come to Montréal I always pay a visit to Jardin Nelson, it's one of my favorite go to restaurants in the city( for work or play).  Jardin Nelson is well known for their ambiance. To set it up you walk through a historic stone enclave where it opens up into their beautiful huge courtyard and gardens with white canvas sail canopies (some stretched over 40' feet, reaching high into the blue sundrenched sky or into the romantic sparkle of nighttime stars).  Add in some live jazz playing in the background and you're surrounded in an atmosphere that is amazing!  The menu will satisfy the most discerning of palates. It runs from fresh crisp salads, tasty sandwiches and salmon entree to delicious pizzas and then, the ultimate cornerstone of Jardin Nelson in my opinion, their Crêpes.   I have to admit, I'm hooked, can't help it, can't get enough, bar none, drool tested and approved the best Crêpes I have ever devoured.   We ordered two styles of crêpes. The first was their classic, tasty, breakfast, lunchtime, dinner time, oh the hell with it...... anytime Nelson crêpe. It's made with this sweet crêpe batter and then they add a homemade sweet apple stuffing, filled with bacon (did I say bacon) your damn right I did and lots of bacon. Then a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a touch of cinnamon and pure maple syrup! I'm salivating right now thinking about how good that crêpe really is.  The second crêpe we ordered was the Aiguillettes de Canard confit. Are you kidding me? (I ask with great enthusiasm) Crêpes with duck breast confit! I have to tell you when we cut into this crêpe the fragrance and taste was pure heaven.This is a savory and filling crêpe folks, it's made with a duck breast aiguillettes, surrounded in cheddar and mozzarella cheese and it has this creamy smooth cranberry orange sauce that lifts this dish into a explosion of heavenly goodness.   We tied this great meal all together with a pitcher of their well known and top rated Red Wine Sangria and we were done. Hang up the phone and put your feet up, satisfied beyond!   If you looking for a cool place to lunch or a romantic place under the stars with great drinks, exceptional food and ambiance Jardin Nelson in Old Port Montréal has a place for you.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for literally forever - my roommate had told me about this place and I had been meaning to take my mom here when she visited in November, but sadly, jardin Nelson is open seasonally and was already closed when my mom was here ): I finally made it here (obviously) and the ambience is lovely. They have an back outdoor garden to sit in, with live jazz music playing, and an option of terrace seating, or an option of indoor seating. There were lots of plants and the atmosphere was casual yet classy.  I came with a group of 7, which was great because we got to order different dishes and try each other's meal.  After much deliberation between the rabbit crepe or the duck salad, I finally settled on the duck leg confit and salad, which was both beautifully presented and delicious as well. I tried my friends French onion soup, which was a very generous portion. It was very cheesy and a little heavy for me, but still very tasty! I also tried my friends seafood crepe which I found creamy and yummy.  My other friend really enjoyed her salmon salad - it was very light and served with julienned leeks, rice vermicelli (and other things)  Service was very good as well.  My only complaints are that I wish we could've been seated closer to the music (we could barely hear it), but it's understandable that we weren't because we were a pretty large party and seats were limited. I also feel that in my mind, I may have built up the food too much, because while it was delicious, it wasn't fantastically amazing (as I had imagined it to be in my head) Still, the food is good, staff is friendly, and LOVE the garden - such a lovely setting - will definitely be back (probably with a smaller party so I can sit closer to the Jazz music)"}
{"text":"To be honest, we stumbled across this place almost by accident, and to top it off, we almost missed the best part about the restaurant!  There is a patio situated right onto Place Jacques Cartier, however there is an open section behind the restaurant, where a jazz quartet was playing.    The food was really good.  My wife had a crepe, my sister also had a crepe (not the same kind of course), while I enjoyed an \"Italian\" pizza, which I know as a Margarita pizza.  We absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid Montreal evening, drinking wine, listening to live jazz  and eating great French food made this a real highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"The setting and music was nice but the food was not very good. We started with a pitcher of sangria, which was okay.  We had the cheese plate and bruschetta. The bruschetta was mediocre and the waiter didn't know what the cheeses were.   For entrees, one of my coworkers had a mushroom and cheese crepe, which she did not like and sent back. I had the fresh salmon -- it was overcooked and dry. Someone else had a pasta which she thought was okay. I would not recommend this place for food. It would be a nice place for drinks and music."}
{"text":"Very.good breakfast.  we ordered the croissant and other pastries and the waffle. Food was good  Not fantastic. I would say the prices reflects more the ambiance because it was a very beautiful place to go have breakfast."}
{"text":"It looks like we just caught this place before their off-season renovations, but even as it was, I would highly recommend Jardin Nelson situated in the heart of the touristy part of the Old Port District/historic area of Montreal.  After a long walk along the waterfront we were surprised to see so much action at Place Jacques Cartier.  At the heart of this location is Rue Saint-Paul, the oldest street in Montreal, first paved in 1672!  There were quite a variety of restaurants (and many places to shop if that's your thing) at the plaza, and even a few bars with live music along the waterfront, but Jardin Nelson caught our attention because they were offering live jazz in the center of their garden-centric dining area.    We were outdoors, but the giant umbrellas (and I mean huge) overhead, flowing gardens and colorful lighting gave it a wonderfully intimate feel.  The jazz band was outstanding (just the right volume too) and the service quite solid.  I enjoyed a charcuterie pizza, which was divided into four sections, each with a different Italian meat.  Their Barbera complemented it perfectly.    When in town you need to go to the historic district, and once the restaurant is freshly renovated, make sure you stop by, particularly if you appreciate live music."}
{"text":"It always comes to my mind when choosing a restaurant for friends gathering, Jardin Nelson with a jazz live band under a humongous tempo.  Food is decent. Price is decent as well. We come here primarily  for the ambiance. One of my friends and I shared a salty crêpe stuffed with creamy  chicken and a pesto asian style noodle salad with grilled salmon filet. The crêpe is amazing, very filling though because of the stuffing. The noodle salad is kinda disappointed to us. Will skip it next time."}
{"text":"We have tried this Cafe a couple of times, and love it. They have live jazz music and shaded tables. Wine by the glass, cappuccino, Apple Must, and great cheeses. The pastries and appetizers are equally good. We plan to return again."}
{"text":"This seems to be a popular restaurant and had high expectations (after seeing a long queue and returning early the next day for dinner). We ordered pizza and a pasta dish; both are average and nothing much to talk about. I think it's  pricey for the quality of food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal. Food is delicious and service is good. Always a live music is amazing!"}
{"text":"We had great service and my asparagus, cheese and ham crêpe was incredible. We sat on the front deck and watched the last of the marathoners as the passed the 16 km mark of the Montreal Rock and Roll Marathon."}
{"text":"We had a nice light lunch of French onion soup, Caesar salad and shrimp in a sweet red pepper sauce that was perfect for the beautiful fall day. The outside tables very comfortable and and allowed for some nice people watching. Our waiter was very pleasant. Over all a very nice yummy break in the afternoon"}
{"text":"Cette place était bien...il y a 15 ans de cela. J'y allais souvent avec mes parents étant pus jeune et j'ai décidé d'y retourner récemment afin de me rappeler de bons souvenirs. Malheureusement, ils semblent ne pas avoir modifié leur carte depuis le temps et les choix sont affreusement démodés. Les plats sont sans saveurs et on peut mieux faire chez soi. Et le service est looooong. Dommage!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  The chicken liver mousse appetizer was creamy, light, and tasty.  Before I knew it, the basket of carbs was empty!  The  duck crepe was savory, but could have used more duck.  Hubby said he liked the rabbit crepe. The hard cider was bubbly and refreshing.  We were seated in the patio and it was a nice place to take a break from sightseeing and enjoy a relaxing bite."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  This is a great place to relax from touring Vieux-Montreal (Old Montreal). Step into an indoor garden that is stunning.  Jardin Nelsen is a \"must see\" while in Montreal.  Beautiful flowers line the walls of the courtyard and hang from most of the railings.  Live jazz plays from the corner, filling the large courtyard with soft sounds perfectly matched to the lovely, colorful floral arrangements.  The atmosphere is breath taking. The service is friendly and attentive.  The menu offers many unique selections, including different appetizers.  (In Montreal, they call appetizers \"entrees,\" which is confusing.)   The food was good."}
{"text":"We visited this spot on a friend's recommendation and it was terrific. It's a gem in Old Montreal and even though it was cold and wet outside it felt special once you enter the gardens at the back and sit under the heaters. The charcuterie platter is incredible with so many flavors. My honey ordered the shrimp in red sauce and he enjoyed that appetizer too. He had the seafood crepe and said great things about it and he finished with the apple crepe for dessert. I enjoyed the feta and watermelon salad and asked the chef to change out the pork for grilled chicken. The salad is more berries than salad, it was interesting. It's a cute spot, make a reservation as it apparently has an incredible line down the street in the summer months. It doesn't take reservations for dinner, only lunch and they only answer the phone between 11.30 - 12 each day for reservations (weird) but worth it."}
{"text":"If you're in old Montreal, you should probably consider this place.  It's very much a come-as-you-are environment with really good food and fairly priced.  My wife and I split the french onion soup (I have a weakness...) and it was a very good rendition of the classic.  Be forewarned, it's on the appetizer menu but could easily be a meal in itself.    I had the vermiere crepe, while my wife had the asiatique salad.  The crepe came on with a shredded radish side (all the crepes do) that had a mild white creamy dressing.  I don't know if the radishes had been blanched, but they were very mild and the dressing complemented them well.  The crepe was very good.  The shell was light and crisp and the vermiere filling was done well.  I wouldn't change a thing other than making clear the size of the soup.  I sampled my wife's asiatique salad and found it well balanced.  The basic construction of the plate was several small chicken fillets in a sweet soy based sauce with garlic and ginger, on a bed of romaine lettuce and Chinese vegetables.  It was well balanced with none of the flavors dominating the show.  It was very pleasing.  Our waiter deserves special merit.  I appreciate the French Canadians' desire to maintain their culture and way of life.  With that said, I've gotten to an age where I just can't cram a French language CD and fake it.  Our waiter engaged us in a very friendly way once he understood this, even coaching us on our very, very limited French.  The banter as we went was memorable.    Oh, and the jazz...."}
{"text":"Lovely location and atmosphere. Not so great food. We ordered the beef dip and crepe. Beef dip was stone cold, and we got a replacement it was still cold. Crepe was so crispy that it tasted more like a quesadilla. French food awkwardness."}
{"text":"A little pricey but worth it! Crepes were delicious! We got the seafood and chicken pesto. Really cute back area and service was good. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, drink list and crepe menu - all with live jazz music playing all day. It's worth a stop, just to sit in the amazing courtyard!"}
{"text":"We were recommended this place because of their inside garden and a very nice setting. I can honestly say that the food didn't disappoint, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. Good, Tasty, satisfying - yes. Anything unusual or unique - not so much. Pricewise, they were decent too, so no regrets.  Their most prized perk, however, is the inside garden. When we got there, there was a ton of people in line waiting to get there. They don't take reservations for dinner, so you can't really avoid this, if you want to visit that garden. It looked very nice and intimate with live music (I think they have that few times a week), but it also felt somewhat hot and stuffy there, despite the size and trees in the area.   We opted out for outside patio facing the busy pedestrian square, and didn't regret it - you can enjoy nice weather while being covered from elements and do a lot of people watching.   All and all - I would recommend them for good decently priced food in a nice setting and perfect location. However, there are a lot of more interesting and unusual places around."}
{"text":"Yes - it's a must. We were there a Saturday evening and there was quite a wait but well worth it. The beautiful garden courtyard and excellent jazz band was everything we wanted. The food was decent, a bit pricey but expected for that part of town. The only thing I would not do again were the sangrias as they were way too sweet. If you are out for a memorable experience, I would recommend you dine here at least once on your visit to Montreal   Food: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Location: 5/5"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Fondue appetizer well worth it.  Main entrees were good to excellent.  The jazz trio played many very popular jazz numbers."}
{"text":"Sit outside, the atmosphere is great! Lots of vegetarian options. I was pleasantly surprised by the Tofu Poke. I also had the Orange Tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious (and a reasonable sized portion)."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot in the heart of old montreal.  Perfect ambience on a nice day.  Choose the main sitting area with open air/no roof. Nice jazz band.   Had delicious crepes...very good service.    Only crowded restaurant  at 3pm which shows you why."}
{"text":"Good vibes with live jazz music for brunch. Didn't have to wait long to get into the garden.   $21 Smoked Salmon Pizza Pretty typical, wouldn't say it's anything outta the ordinary but it's fairly good. Wouldn't recommend coming all the way here to have this.  $18 Forestiere Crepe Recommend. Definitely try a crepe when you come by. It's pretty big so split it with a few people.  $19.95 Smoked Duck Sandwich Recommend. Very fancy and unique experience. A bit salty but the flavours works really well. A bit small but comes with salad too   Must visit designation for Montreal. Very romantic! Try the French onion soup too, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We visited for brunch, we were drawn in by the gorgeous garden patio seating and live jazz music.   Our server was very sweet and attentive. The food was good, aside from the baked calamari, it was limp and flavorless. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Burger is just ok. Tastes like frozen patty. I won't get again.  Poutine is good. Beer is great.  Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"On our recent vist to Montreal we dined here and had a very disappointing meal. The service was pitiful. When our waiter was not avoiding our repeated attempts to gain his attention he was just plain rude and unhelpful. The food was 3 stars at best but the portions were stingy and the food overpriced for what you receive. The ambiance was 3 stars. The service was a big zero. We weren't the only ones either. I noticed multiple tables with unfilled drinks and frustrated patrons. It took atleast 20 minutes to get our bill and after that he ran our card 4 times before he was able to provide the final bill which ending up triggering a fraud alert with our credit card company. Never ever will we dine here again."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 8 girls and we were seated right away in the patio. The jazz band was playing and the ambience was just lovely. It was a perfect sunny day but they accommodated the fact that the sun was beaming down on us and opened the canopy for cover. The food was excellent!! Everyone loved their orders. I ordered the duck confit with a side of summer salad. That salad was the best salad I've ever had! And I don't even like salad. We would definitely come here over and over again!"}
{"text":"It's all about the environment here. I went there for an evening. I wasn't looking much for the food but their crepes were not bad at all. However, if I leave this review with one note is that this is an ideal place for dates and/or to show a visitor a good relaxing time in Montreal."}
{"text":"One of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had. It's a building constructed around a courtyard, with wind sail overhangs that protect you from the elements inside. So basically, your entirely outside, and if it's raining it's quite the show. Rain funnels down the sails into large glass columns. Hard to explain, but VERY cool. Food was above average, but set amidst all of the tourist attraction area, it's more than what you'd expect. When I'm back in Montreal, I'm going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch places in Montreal. Must visit! Outdoor seating and good service"}
{"text":"beautiful scenery no matter where you choose to sit in this place. the entire restaurant feels like you are inside a garden. our waitress was excellent and a professional. we ordered wine and bruschetta as a light mid-day snack. it was delicious. the wine list goes on for days. there was a jazzy band playing softly which just adds to the light, airy feel. this place does it right."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is its one of a kind in Old Port. It has this big terrace in the back and always live jazz. They can fit bigger groups, however this place is always busy. The only thing I didnt like is because it is so busy the kind of rush you, and if you just go to have a drink, well they will push for u to eat. If that does not bother you, then I recommend it for the food and ambiance"}
{"text":"Beautiful lush scenery with live music and delicious food! But tourist location but food is very authentic. Great place in the summer when patio is open!"}
{"text":"This place is in the best location.  You are right in the middle of the action.  There is a covered patio where you can eat and take in the scenery.  The atmosphere was excellent. The kids loved the eggplant parmigiana and cinnamon apple and bacon crepe. My French dip was excellent. Unfortunately, my wife's dill shrimp pizza was terrible. It was bitter and the shrimp was over-cooked.  There are two lessons here -  (1) not everything should be on a pizza and (2) don't go to a French restaurant and order fancy pizza . . .just saying."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to Montreal once without having dinner here... great service, environment and never failed to impress"}
{"text":"My family of four stopped for lunch and decided to sit inside rather than the front porch and it was beautiful. Open air and plants every where. My wife and I had crepes. I had the rabbit saddle and my wife had the curry chicken, both were fantastic. The kids had a pizza which was also tasty. Their microbrewery beer is good and good service too."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place for lunch and had to bring my girlfriend the next day. The place has a Tuscany feel to it, beautiful,  inviting and a jazz band plays periodically. Hello old montreal!"}
{"text":"We knew it was going to be a horrible tourist trap but Jazz in a beautiful garden was hard to pass up!  We went with a friend visiting from Edmonton and after reviewing the menu online, we knew the prices that we were walking into. We did however expect the prices to match the dish. We ordered a couple savoury crepes and a pizza. I envied the BF who had the pizza after being served my crepe which was more like a calzone meets omelette. I really hope tourists don't think this is what a crepe is after eating here! The coleslaw it was served with was bland with barely any dressing and the plates and baskets they used to serve was reminiscent to a pub which didn't fit into their gorgeous decor.  The only saving grace this place has is the awesome live jazz they have and the beautiful setting they play in. Service here is also great as both our hostess and server were super friendly and polite. If you really must visit here, consider drinks or an appetizer (we had calamari to start which was good) over food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The ambience was top knotch! There was a jazz band playing the background and their patio is lovely. We got a recommendation from the souvenier shop nearby to come here. Three of us had the salmon poké bowl which was so fresh, yummy and filling. I also had the crab cake which was good but not worth the cost. My friend had a pizza which she raved about. The mango frozen drinks were good too. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I went with my significant other for our anniversary on the advice of a colleague.  Spectacular setting, very nice live music, efficient and friendly service.  The ambiance started to get a little annoying when we realized that we had to raise our voices to have a conversation, as the voices of other diners rebound on the walls.  The food is really average: salads, crêpes and pizza... We had fried calamari: the bits were clumped together and served with and unappetizing sweet hot sauce that had stayed too long on a counter (it had dried a bit). A spinach and strawberry salad that was completely ruined by a *vanilla* yogurt dressing. The same sweet vanilla flavoured crêpe will be filled indifferently with a sweet or a savoury filling. I am really not sure about vanilla and veal blanquette (what is it with you and vanilla, people?). The duck shepherd's pie (paté chinois) was disappointingly bland, barely saved by the really good home made ketchup and beets that were served on the side.  The check finished to kill the experience: 100$ for two for just starters and entrées, no dessert, three drinks (no wine) and an espresso, that's a bit steep.  We had a really good time, but this place (restaurant?) has absolutely nothing to do with it.  I guess it's an OK place for a drink with friends. For the gastronomic experience, at that price, there are better places in that area."}
{"text":"Had lunch on the patio here with family and kids. It was a very warm day but the patio had a nice breeze and the people watching was great. Three adults + 3 kids shared 3 crepes plus a dessert crepe and were pleasantly full. The Nelson (apple, bacon, cheese) was sweet as other reviewers noted, even without the side of maple syrup, but was delicious. The Basilico had chicken and pesto on a crepe made with corn batter (didn't know that existed, but it added a lot to the flavor). The duck crepe had a very nice citrus note. And you can't really go wrong with banana chocolate crepe for dessert. Service was unobtrusive, English-friendly and timely, but I wouldn't go here with 6+ if you're on a tight schedule. We would definitely return to this lovely spot."}
{"text":"Family and I passed by on a whim and overheard the jazz playing. Saw that it was a full house during lunchtime, and decided we just had to come back for dinner. Service was great, and food was even better. Would highly recommend the duck leg with summer salad- this does not disappoint. Their peach rosé sangria was also good as well.   This place was so good, we dined here twice during our stay, as other nearby restaurants could not compare."}
{"text":"Gorgeous courtyard, a must for summer brunch or lunch. Live music and wonderful service. This is the place to go for crepes, love the seafood one. The perfect place to bring tourists, in the heart of the Old Port."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Great food (rabbit crepe, pasta salad, basil lemonade), friendly staff, and superb outdoor patio/garden atmosphere. One of my favorite things about my visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the reviews mentioning the average food, but it was good enough to enjoy and the ambiance made the place better.  We had the bell pepper shrimp to start, which was pretty good but kind of pricey at $16. I had the cannelloni casserole dish and my boyfriend had the ribs. Let me just side track and say that their menu is extensive, there's a little something for everyone, but Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible once said the more menu items available the more flustered people get at deciding what to eat. That's exactly how I felt and after trying our dishes we realized that we impulsively chose wrong. The meat in the cannelloni was under cooked, but the cheese and tomato sauce had good flavor. The ribs were slathered in thick BBQ sauce - which tasted straight out of a bottle. My boyfriend enjoyed them but I thought they were really mediocre. We also got as pitcher of the peach rose and that was kind of disappointing. It was too sweet and flat. The giant cookie we had for dessert was the redeeming dish for Le Jardin.  The service was pretty good, our waitress was friendly and checked in often.  The only thing this place has going is the incredible outdoor area with the huge retractable umbrellas and the flower adorned brick walls. The umbrellas opened up just in time to avoid getting everyone soaked. The center pole of the largest umbrella collected the rain water and it was actually pretty cool. The jazz band played in the background throughout the night, which was a nice touch.  I guess this place is worth checking out if you've never been but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I always love eating in beautiful restaurants and this restaurant is stunning indeed. It is open air restaurant with parasols and pergolas covering the entire area for shelter from the elements. The courtyard is covered with flower and trees in the most pleasing manner. It also multi-level which makes for interesting seating areas with various vantage points.  Ok so we have established that it's a gorgeous restaurant, now what about the food and service?  The wait during noon on a sunny Saturday was only 15 minutes.  But the food really puts this place over the top. Often pretty restaurants get by \"on their looks\" and serve substandard food and have crappy service. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and the prices were surprisingly low for a high volume tourist area. Their menu in expansive and the place is known for their crepes.    We started with a pitcher of rosé and peaches sangria for $33 ... so refreshing on a hot summer day.  For appetizers, I did the oven baked crab cake ($19) and it was great. No flimsy strands of crab here, it was CHUNKS OF CRAB all throughout without any filler! This would be enough as a small meal for someone who is not piggy (not me) since it also came with salad.   For my entrée I got the pate chinois au candard ($21), which was their duck confit shepard's pie. Yelpers were raving about this dish and once again my people did not lead me astray. I savoured every bite and they did not skimp on the duck. My friend got the lobster mac & cheese ($29) which had huge chunks of lobster throughout.  Overall another top restaurant in Montreal with a unique setting and great food."}
{"text":"Charming place to enjoy some drinks and live music, but don't order the food.  Ordered two appetizers, both of which were inedible.  Margarita was excellent, though."}
{"text":"Location and music is good; service isn't, and the waitress was impolite. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here while in town on my \"mini-moon\" and it was probably the most memorable dinner we had.  I wish I got the name of our server but he was a young man who made the whole experience better than ever.  He made two recommendations and we tried them both--- absolutely delicious and the ambiance on the patio is unmatched."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us.  It is in the heart of the tourist section.  We went on Saturday so they had a special brunch menu in addition to the regular menu.  There was a band playing which was lovely.  We sat in the courtyard which was pretty with beautiful flowers and covered with umbrellas for some much needed shade.  Service was just OK.  I got the Asian chicken salad which was good but had a decent amount of ginger in it.  Also got a fruit drink (called ambrosia) which was just OK so not worth the high price."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm just going to assume that the high ratings for this place are for the ambiance and live jazz music, because they certainly can't be for the food - at least not for their crêpes.  I started off with their limonade maison which I would actually recommend for its refreshing addition of basil. While that was pretty good, unfortunately my crêpe was just sad. The Florentine consisted of a buckwheat and hemp batter and a spinach, ham and brie cheese filling. This was served with a side of some sort of slaw with dried cranberries. The slaw needed a bit more acidity, in my opinion, but the crêpe was what was truly disappointing. The actual crêpe itself was just too thin and salty, but the FILLING. Dear god, why on earth would anyone would put that much filling inside?? Not to mention that it was too salty. My friend's Basilico crêpe was also the same: too much filling, too salty, crêpe batter wasn't on point. We were both pretty disappointed. I realize that sometimes you just happen to order \"the wrong thing\", but I really expect a restaurant like this to be solid across the menu."}
{"text":"I came here mostly for the environment. If you go during a busy time, you likely will need to wait outside for 30 minutes or so. You have the option to dine in the centre of the restaurant - which is where all the flowers, decor and jazz music is. But you can also choose to sit towards outside facing Old Port. Sitting outside will shorten your wait time.   Once my friends and I got a table (centre), we were overwhelmed (in a good way), by the beauty of the surrounding. It's probably one of the most romantic restaurants I've been to.  You are surrounded by colorful flowers, with mini tents above your table and heaters (during winter). The Jazz band is situated in the middle floor (there are  3 open floors), and almost everyone could pretty much see them. Do note, that there are potentially small birds here and there. It adds to the garden feel.   I ordered the Sweet Folie Salad, lasagna and the Nelson Crepe. The food itself was okay. It was not bad, but not amazing either. I think the most unique was the Nelson Crepe - I remember bacon, maple syrup. Perhaps I need to return and order other products. But based on what I've tried, it's alright.   Service was okay. They are quick about getting you in, but also quick about getting you out. Perhaps it's because they were packed that night."}
{"text":"As we wandered around Old Montreal looking for a place to eat, my friend suggested Jardin, as she'd heard great things about it.  We looked at the menu, and I wasn't particularly drawn to anything, but agreed we should partake.  Although quite nice from the outside, the real treasure lies within, with a beautiful garden courtyard which has seating on multiple levels, and is filled with the sounds of jazz music.  Since we were just visiting Montreal, I decided to go with a crepe, to have something relatively authentic compared to the pizzas and other items on the menu.  I went with the mushroom, brie and parm crepe and it was in fact delicious!  Super unhealthy, but delicious.  We also shared a pitcher of sangria- it was okay, and the presentation definitely could have been better.  It was served in a plastic water pitcher that you'd see at Pizza Hut or Olive Garden... I kind of expected better of this place!  Overall service was pretty good, but a bit slow.  Perhaps they were short staffed as it is nearing the end of the season, but my friend did wait about 20 minutes for her dessert to come out- and it was just sorbet.  Go primarily for the atmosphere, and don't have super high expectations about the food- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Beautiful place, the interior garden is spectacular and live jazz is all you need in an open air garden with fresh food to enjoy your day!  The food is not top notch (but also not top price), I wouldn't recommend Sangria unless you have a sweet tooth.   Overall, great experience, worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Everyone in our party loved our food. Service was great and our waiter was a lot of fun. We would go back in a second if in Montreal again"}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because of the crepes, if it was atmosphere it would be 5 stars but I couldn't go 4 over all because they are known for their crepes.  The patio is super cool, the sidewalk dining and location is priceless.  A fun place to go, problem was we went for the crepes...I mean french quesadilla.  Maybe I'm been spoiled or eating the wrong crepes but I thought they should be moist and a bit ply-able but ours were dry and crunchy almost like a quesadilla.  I was also not happy with the quality of the ingredients and the variety of the wines by the glass both of which are not what I think when I think Montreal."}
{"text":"Lovely place, classic and cozy. Jazz music as background.. Great. The waitress was nice, smiley and fast. The food was  not that great... I took Mac and cheese, good but nothing special. The crepe is good, tasty and well cooked with tasty cheese. The sweet crepe was great, huge and filled with ice cream, loved it. The place could be pricey, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is just my favourite resto in Montréal for bringing friends during the summer. The live jazz, the cozy courtyard setting, sitting under giant umbrellas... It's got a vibe all its own.  Your main focus at Jardin should be salads. The rest of their menu can be hit or miss, but these folks do salads right. Also a nice place to stop by for a drink, not necessarily for a full meal though.  Touristy or not, if you're a Montrealer, a foodie, and you've never eaten here... Aim to mend the errors of your ways, to redeem your soul. You deserve it.  They're only open in the summer though, it's an open air dining sort of situation."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it, the only tony flaw is the pizza I ordered was slightly greasy that's all! Great ambiance, music,'service, menu options and concept!"}
{"text":"Classy place in the heart of the Vieux Port in Montreal. Food is fine, nothing special, overpriced as you imagine any other touristy spot in Old Port would be. You end up at this type of place for the experience not the food. If you're visiting Montreal and have just finished up enjoying the cobble stone roads, the port, and the Notre Dam, it's a great place to stop by for a drink. I recommend the blue curacao sangria. It's delicious!  Jardin Nelson has two patios; one in the front facing the craziness of Place Jacques Cartier and the other more private terrace in the back. I always choose to sit in the back terrace. There is sometimes a wait, but it's never been too long. The back terrace has vines & flowers running up its stoned walls. The terrace is split into split level balconies and there is usually live jazz music. I used to take my mother and her friends here when they visited me during my university years in Montreal. Only giving it 4 stars since the food was average as was the service."}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars.  A great place to look out for from mid-April onwards as they're solely a patio (front and back garden) restaurant and so open only for those coveted months. Situated smack downtown by the waterfront in Montreal meant we were in for a line up. They didn't take reservations either. But rest assured that it's worth the wait. The atmosphere was superb and there was live music serenading us in the lovely sunshine out at the back.  We had a small pitcher of the rose peach sangria (~$22), which poured ~4 small glasses. It was certainly refreshing for the warm day but a little pricey in my opinion.  Food wise I had most difficult time deciding on. Ended up with the duck confit crepe. It was DE.LI.CIOUS. The duck filling was so creamy, with the slightest hint of sweetness from the cranberries. The crepe was also very thin and crispy. Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the most overrated restaurant in Montreal. Rude staff, unprofessional treatment of costumers. They clearly tell you that if you aren't satisfied you can leave because there is a huge line in front of the place and they rarely have free table and simply they cannot care less about you!"}
{"text":"This is a real montreal gem! Everything sets the tone for a delicious evening. The setting is just beautiful with cute birds flying in the outdoor gardens with just loud enough jazz music via live bad in the background. This place is perfect for a date night and quite affordable. I would return here over and over !"}
{"text":"While the jazz was incredible, the food was subpar. We had the salmon lasagna, which was underwhelming. Extremely heavy, but not very flavorful. We also had the tuna tartare which was very good, as well as the crepe which again was very heavy but not very flavorful. Sitting outside was amazing. The band was lovely and almost made up for the bland food."}
{"text":"Although the crepe was very good and our waiter was a kind young lady, our seemingly great experience turned into a bitter one when a rude Monsieur told me to walk out or throw away a partial sandwich I had in my bag that I was going to finish from my breakfast earlier. I understand if you would like to point out that it might not be allowed in this establishment considering I was completely unaware of it, but if our table is still consuming from the restaurant as well, I personally would consider it twice before interrupting what seemed to be a lovely afternoon snack, with such an unwelcoming display of service. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is a beautiful gem in the heart of the old port in Montreal. The atmosphere is unbeatable with live jazz music, birds, lit-up trees and a beautiful terrace. The food however, is nothing special. The drinks are expensive but the sangria is quite good. All and all, go for the atmosphere and a drink."}
{"text":"Loved sitting in the lush garden courtyard, retrofit into an old building site. It was great to hear a live jazz combo in that setting. It sometimes veered into cheesy cover song territory, but was really good when they stuck to actual jazz. The food was decent but a bit underwhelming - the salmon salad has no greens, just vermicelli noodles without discernible sauce, and though I liked my lobster salad more then my guy did, I did find that encasing it in dairy and fruit did nothing to celebrate the unique flavour of the magnificent animal that died for me. Service was really, really slow because they're so busy, and our upper patio table kept getting blasted with heat from the kitchen vent on the roof, but otherwise it was a terrific lunch experience in a cool spot."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson was a place I visited last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a long line up the weekend that I went but there was so much to see and do that, I had no problem to kill time. Once I was seated, there was a live jazz band that wasnt overbearing and they really set the tone for the evening. I got myself red wine and a regular ceasar with eggplant parmesean which was awesome. Earlier that day I had a big meal so I didnt really have room to explore the menu. I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"An excellent brunch spot that really does have the feel of a garden.  Had the cheesecake filled crepe, with a side of bacon. It was rich and delicious. DCs enjoyed their crepes as well.   The sweet local cola helped stave off the impending food coma."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant!! The food was good. Nice service had a band playing music in the background.  Also, nice atmosphere with the garden around you.  It is semi open place.  I would definitely go again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Make sure to sit in the back area, great garden atmosphere, often with live music. Great ambience. Food mostly great. French onion soup best I've ever eaten, shrimp over a red pepper sauce very good (cold shrimp like in shrimp cocktail), baby spinach with strawberry salad excellent. The French dip beef was very good, au jus touch of liquor. Only disappointment was the chicken crepe, very mediocre.    Also, rolls are typical restaurant rolls, nothing at all imaginative (would definitely suggest to the owners something better, more unique, maybe a baked bread, or at least heat these standard rolls).  Overall, great place and meal."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! We loved this place! Amazing atmosphere, great food and solid service. What more can you ask for? Sure, there are cheaper restaurants in the area but you will not be sorry to spend the little extra."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin, my aunt and my sister.  The french onion soup.  It was really very good, and it started off the meal very well-- a nice clean broth, good onion flavor, and I'm a sucker for emmental cheese.  As for the rest of the fare, it was okay.  I had a veal crepe, my aunt had a seafood crepe (Newburg), and my younger sister had the Cartier pasta salad (which is really just pasta).  The crepes themselves are a little buttery.  The veal crepe came in a curry-like sauce with a bit of an orange-y flavor.  The seafood crepe had nice pieces of seafood in it.  The pasta salad was slices of lasgna with pesto and a strange combination of mango and kalamata olives as well.  The dessert (a pudding chomeur) was much too sweet, and tasted like the toasted brown sugar on the top of apple crumble.  The apple cider sangria tasted like juice.  Beautiful place, the food was all right."}
{"text":"When you come across a place at the Nexus of all tourists on foot, one is wary about what you will get in a restaurant.  Thankfully Jardin Nelson does not fit the stereotypical tourist trap.  It was actually a truly  enjoyable find.  The atmosphere is great.  We were hoping to sit out front on the patio, but we ended up inside which turned out to be a real treat.  The 3 piece jazz group was outstanding, the birds whistling around throughout the meal was fun and the feeling sitting outside surrounded by the old walls of days gone by was special. The service, while very friendly, is not overly fast.  It took sometime to finally get someone to show up.  Very personable and engaged but it took over 10-15 minutes to get the glass of wine and at least another 5 before the water appeared.  After another 5-10 minutes or so we finally received a basket of bread. The food followed shortly after the bread and it ranged from very good(Tex Mex pizza) to an okay crepe (whole wheat curry chicken and cheese).  The pizza was very flavourful.  The crust was nicely done.  A bit pricey at $16.95 for a single serving pizza but I guess that's the price you pay for the heart of Vieux Montreal.  The curry chicken crepe was not overfly flavourful, very mild on the curry, and a bit dry (perhaps the whole wheat crepe wasn't compensated for, i.e soaks up all the sauce).  The side of slaw was a nice counter balance to the curry.  We asked for the 'house' hot oil, made with habanero peppers.  That really helped enhance the flavours and while we were warned it was really really hot, I found it just had a nice little zing. Overall a good experience.  A bit pricey for what you get.  Get here early though (before 6:30) as the line gets very long."}
{"text":"!! Only great things to say about this place. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? 1000% YES. There was already a line lining the outside of the restaurant when we got there (had to wait ~40min)but completely worth it for their amazing outdoor seating. The ambience is wonderful with the wonderful jazz and exterior, the staff was really nice and friendly,service was relatively fast considering how it was always fully packed, and their food  no words. Our group of 3 shared the estivale salad (refreshing, perfect blend of fruit and veggies and delicious dressing) and the du Marche pizza (really good vegetarian pizza with doughy crust). We also had the lemon rosemary chicken wings for an appetizer. Sharing left us contently full with enough room for dessert! Definitely recommend the orange tiramisu: the orange isn't overpowering and it's creamy but not soggy. Also got the ice cream crepe: ice cream itself was really good quality and the crepe wasn't soggy. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner, it wouldn't have been my choice among the bazillion options in Montreal, but such is the nature of dinner with the client.   I'll give it three stars for the atmosphere (great outdoor seating on a pleasant summer night) and for the attentive waitstaff. But the food was very mediocre, unfortunately I suppose that's expected for a restaurant in a tourist district. The food I saw (and ate) was very generic Italian food that you could get anywhere (and wtf--Italian food at \"Jardin\" Nelson?). In retrospect I should have ordered the crepes, they looked better and might be more solid choices. The nachos were an interesting choice (ordered by a colleague). If you're in the mood for nachos and a beer, it's a decent choice (but again, nachos at \"Jardin\" Nelson?). The desert portions looked to be very generous, especially the crepes.   Everything on the menu seemed too expensive for what you get, but this might be typical for Montreal (my first trip here)."}
{"text":"I adore the Jardin Nelson. Not only is the location stunning, being surrounded by historical buildings just off Place Jacques Cartier in Old Montreal, but the atmosphere in this indoor/outdoor restaurant can't be beat.  The largest part of the restaurant and most well known is their big terasse (can you call it that when it's more than 3/4 of the restaurant?) with huge parasols in case it rains. Sit under the sun or the stars while eating perfectly cooked meal or dessert crepes, while sipping on a glass of fine wine.  Jardin Nelson is perfect for a romantic night out, especially when the jazz band is playing!"}
{"text":"We were in Old Port and ate here at the recommendation of a local, the owner of our rental apt. We couldn't have been more pleased. It was unusually hot outside and we were able to snag a table for 8 under the canopies of the terrace. A young woman was singing French Jazz....coupled with the flowers everywhere...well it made for fantastic Sunday atmosphere. Our server was training a new girl, on her very first day and she did a fantastic job. Every menu item we had was spot on- pizzas, salmon platter, lobster sandwich, crepes and bruschetta. The drinks were on point, as well (whiskey lemonade, basil lemonade and a nice beer selection). I can see why it's so popular."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place during a overnight in Montreal  creative outdoor venue and it was pouring rain!  Nice live soft jazz music The local brew is boreal and it was great too."}
{"text":"All time favourite place to have sangria on their beautiful terrace. There's always a good reason why to have brunch there, especially on sunny days. Giving it a 4 because they don't have enough vegan meals."}
{"text":"Très belle terrasse avec band de Jazz, elle vaut le détour. La bouffe est ordinaire. Plus pour prendre un verre si en tourisme à Montreal"}
{"text":"It's a really cute place with overpriced food, great service, and live music.   Located right in the heart of Old Montreal, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot right when they opened on a Friday. We were seated in their covered terrace while the band was setting up. Our server was attentive, kind, and helped us decide what to get.  The drinks were surprisingly strong, especially for noon on a Friday. My Moscow Mule was nice and strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed her smoothie. We ended up sharing the baked goat cheese and the local cheese plate. The goat cheese was wrapped in a flaky pastry and served over a pesto sauce and a red pepper sauce. Really good. The cheese was all local and pretty decent, but it could have been bigger for the price.  You come here for the experience, not really for the food. All in all, a really fun place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing service, food, location and love their live bands! I wish they were open all year long. Their melon sangria is the best sangria I've ever had in my whole life!   The place gets crowded very fast. I suggest you wait in line and sit at their terrace in the back which offers a live band and an awesome atmosphere. We love the chicken wings as an entree! The american pizza is also delicious. Although, a bit pricy, it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Definitely a tourist place, but it has a great atmosphere and the crepes are excellent. The wait staff are nice and don't rush you out if you're just relaxing and enjoying the live music. I highly recommend the white wine sangria, as it is particularly refreshing on a warm day."}
{"text":"Such a nice ambiance. Food was pretty good but a little greasy. The line is extremely long but our concierge (Omni Hotel) gave us his business card and we were able to cut the line! Otherwise I don't know if it would've been worth it. Our waitress was also very sweet and gave us some good recommendations of things to do in Montreal."}
{"text":"Gorgeous terrace! Food delicious - I got a veggie and cheese filled crêpe. The crêpe was corn based and very yummy. Great place to eat, drink, and enjoy the beauty of Montreal. I have 2 kids 9 & 12, one is a very picky eater... everyone was happy here."}
{"text":"A Long and diverse menu is sometimes pretty bad indicator in my mind as it displays jack of all trades master of none kind of style and that was kind of what happened here.  Everyone was able to find something they wanted, but there was a lot of choices to be made. In the end you just talk yourself into something and it is pretty good.   It's a big touristy place that's covers all the bases but not someplace to go out of your way to get too."}
{"text":"Un 340e avis pour le Jardin Nelson! Un incontournable de l'été à Montréal. Leur terrasse est magnifique. Tous les soirs, un band y joue du Jazz. On entends les chants des petits oiseaux tout autour.   Leur menu est très variées comparativement à certaines années où le menu était écrit sur le  napperon en papier.   Les plats y sont très bon. J'ai goûté leur tartare et leur ceviche. Délicieux les deux. Par contre le ceviche est un peu trop citroné et le goût des poivrons y prends le dessus.   Ils ont des cocktails, bières et sangria. Leur pichet de sangria est environs de 30$. Je ne vous recommande pas l'endroit pour aller Boire seulement..!"}
{"text":"I wish I could post photos but I was so relaxed at Jardin Nelson that I forgot to take out my camera.  We were done touring Vieux Montreal and just needed to sit down and have an early afternoon breather. We sat in an inner courtyard surrounded by tall stone walls festooned with ferns and summer blooms. We shared an excellent cheese plate and a Caesar salad and enjoyed the local hard cider. The children had simple sweet crepes. A jazz quartet played. Atmosphere gets a ten, service gets a ten, and food gets an 8."}
{"text":"The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite. We were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one! Even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!"}
{"text":"We were told about this place and had to come. I mean, live jazz and brunch. Say no more. We were seated in a beautiful courtyard with a three man jazz band playing. We chose the avocado toast with smoked salmon. I've never seen such perfect avocados. The combination of flavours is amazing. We also shared a sausage, egg and cheese crepe which of course was so delicious. A couple of breakfast cocktails, delicious food and live jazz music in the open air makes for a great start to our first full day in Montreal."}
{"text":"My favorite summer spot! Once every summer I will be at Jardin Nelson without a fail.   I simply enjoy the view inside... you go inside but you are actually outside. It's beautiful terrace, trees all around. I also love how plants are waved up on the stone wall.   The vibe is classy; the live jazz music is soothing and fine foot tapping.   The service is very amiable and helpful. Even though the place is always super busy; I am impressed with the patient service   The restaurant has amazing crepes and fine summer cocktails.   It's a super busy restaurant; there is always a line up; but the wait is worth. It's a perfect place to enjoy lunch or dinner with friends. Best part is the location is that it is in the heart of beautiful old Montreal.  I can't wait till next summer!"}
{"text":"Poke and \"tex-mex pizza\" in a French restaurant? Is this real life?  This place drips tourist, with the menu and location to fit. However, if you stick to the basics, you should be fine.  I first came here years ago and the French onion soup was venerable. However, my recent visit, I went for the forestiere crepe. The crepe itself was fine. The crepe had a bit of crisp to it, while the filling inside was rich and flavorful. There was an abundance of brie and savory mushrooms. The accompaniment that came with the crepe was that side salad you first think of when it comes to French cuisine: jicama salad. The salad was fine, but just a bit strange for a crepe.  Service was relatively friendly and my server was nice, especially since I could speak elementary French. However, I had to cringe when the American next table spoke French-ish and ended with \"por favor\".  3.5 but I'll notch it up to a 4."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place for dine in and chill for a drink. The service and environment are out of your imagination.  The store can divide into 2 parts : garden and patio. I was sitting in garden zone,  treated with light music and incredible views. I strongly recommend this restaurant. It's convenient to get there, just located in the old montreal!"}
{"text":"Ordinary. Crepes are fine, but nothing to differentiate them. The garden in nice and pleasant, but gets too crowded in the summer."}
{"text":"The goat cheese empanada thing (from the appetizer menu) is amazing! I was in Montreal for a few weeks and we went back time and again just for that one item. Oh, and their signature bread pudding! Also amazing. I ordered a crepe the first time I went, but nothing compares to their goat cheese/brie empanada. It sits on a sublime tomato sauce and the cheese oozes out when you cut it open. Super duper."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on a warm Sunday night a few weeks ago and we really enjoyed it. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and not what I would expect so far North. Just going in and soaking up the beautiful scenery, along with the live Jazz, is well worth it.  My wife and I really liked our drinks but found the food just average (especially for a great food city like Montreal). Overall a great experience that I would highly recommend. It would be perfect place to stop and have dessert."}
{"text":"It's a tourist trap for sure. I've had better else where. While the setting was great & our waitress was awesome, I would not go back because I just didn't enjoy the food. My aunt got sick after eating here so I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Le service était excellent, en plus il s'est mis à pleuvoir durant le souper et tout le personnel a très bien gérer et rapidement. On a bien aimé nos plats, la salade en repas était excellente."}
{"text":"Très bien situé au Vieu Port, place Jacques Cartier, passage incontournable des touristes, surtout l'été pour les terrasses et les activités du coin Il y a des live bands qui jouent le soir, et la bouffe est excellente. Nous avions pris des pizzas avec des amis et étions vraiment étonnés de la qualité de celles-ci. La sangria est très bonne l'été aussi! Surtout en terrasse! Prix légèrement élevés mais c'est normal pour le quartier Fermé l'hiver"}
{"text":"Located in \"old Montreal\" this place from the outside looks very much like a regular tourist trap restaurant.  Inside, which is essentially the outside, had elegant shading is chic, modern and full of natural light.  The service staff were attentive and nice.  The food is overpriced - hit and miss...  Side salad that comes with your crepe was terrible but the crepes are very good.  Water / glasses smell like fish yet the Latte bowl was marvellous.  The so called \"baked calamari was soggy, clearly undercooked, yet the kids macaroni was a hit, according to my kids.  So, definitely worth a visit if you are in desperate need to sit down - stick to drinks, soak in the live Sunday brunch music.  Forget about complaining, staff who take your order in English seem to lose your complaint in translation - ie. Management, I believe doesn't care for complaints."}
{"text":"Having been bookmarked for some time now, finally came here to eat after work.    I remember walking by this place at night and thinking it was such a great idea to have an indoor-outdoor garden seating; It looked breathtaking.  You have the option to sit at the entrance's terrace or in the back, where it has multi-levels of garden seating.  It's an outdoor space that has large umbrellas that would catch rain.  Even though there were umbrellas, the sun still made its way through giving a lot of light.  (No roof, umbrellas act as ceiling).  There was no line when we arrived at 5:30pm, but, it was starting to fill up quickly with locals and tourists.  The live jazz band was a nice touch.  I felt like I was having brunch for dinner at a posh country club.  Being pricey, we only tried the sweet folly salad that was a mix of arugula, blue cheese, pomergrenate, walnuts, pork belly, with a whole lotta other things.  We got a crepe each and a drink.  The salad was good but it was a small portion.  I ordered the chicken curry crepe with cheese.  The crepe itself is made with buckwheat and it was very good...I don't know what I was thinking by ordering the chicken curry, but, it was an interesting combination of flavours.  (The chicken was rubbery like processed meat).  My bf ordered the apple, bacon, cheese crepe served with maple syrup on the side.  This would have been a better choice as a dessert as it was like eating a pie, but, a delicious good ol' American pie.  Being a \"garden\", there are trees in the dining area and birds flying about.  I was seated near a tree and so when a bird went into flight, I must have been in its way because I felt a wing brush my cheek.  Very interactive :D.  PS - the chairs are plastic lawn chairs.  I recommend this place if planning a date for its atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance.  This is my new favorite place in Montreal and I would eat every meal here if I could.  Thanks to yelp pictures, I opted for the lobster salad sandwich.  It was simple but so fresh and flavorful. The salad was meh, but ingredients were definitely fresh and vibrant. I wasn't a fan of the dressing and wish I had been given options like a balsamic rather than poppyseed or whatever it was, but that's neither here nor there...just get the lobster sandwich and you'll be a happy camper.  Friends ordered pizza, tuna salad and beef tartar. Everyone seemed happy with their meals, so YAY.   This is definitely a place to hang out for awhile and have drinks and good food while listening to some jazz."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to re-visit Jardin Nelson on my recent trip to Montreal.    As in the past, the crepes, the jazz ensemble, and the overall atmosphere were wonderful.  Yes, it is a bit touristy, but isn't most of Vieux Montreal?  I enjoyed the Newburg and my dinning partner the Argenteuil....wonderful!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Tourist trap. Stay away. The staff has an attitude as if you are doing them a favor by giving them your business."}
{"text":"For having tried that place a few times, the food is less then stellar. It just is very average.   It is however a good spot for a romantic evening with the band."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner while in Montreal in search of good crepes and this place came up as a place to see. the area is tourist trappy so my expectations were low but when I'm outside of NYC, I go into tourist mode so don't judge me. The wait to get in was ~40 mins but they moved us along rather quickly. We were seated and our server greeted us promptly and took our order for drinks.  Their beer and wine selection was pretty good. I tried a Boreal Red on the strength of our servers suggestion and it was a great beer. I wish I would have brought back a 6 pack or five with me. The menu had nice offerings but we all went for crepes.  I tried the Pork cutlet crepe and it was really good.  The crepe was cooked well and not overly goopy and cheesey. The flavor was aiming for Greek and they got it right on the money with the red onion, spinach and yogurt sauce.  I've only hade crepes one time before but so far, its Jardin Nelson 1, other place 0.  My companions also enjoyed their crepes, and being vegetarians, they had choices galore. The ambiance in the rear seating area was nice. Although it was very crowded, the tables weren't on top of each other so there was a sense of intimacy. They had a jazz quartet playing on the stage which was nice. If we find ourselves back in Montreal, I would venture to say that we would make a repeat trip back."}
{"text":"I'm from Quebec and have a \"chien miracle\" i.e service dog. Frances very rudely and against the laws of Quebec refused us entry.  In her opinion, \"chien miracle\" are only for blind people.  The dog has his service ID and legal papers permitting entry, but despite that, Frances said her policies supersede the law.  In several years, this has only happened a handful of times but when it does, it's always shocking."}
{"text":"The Best French Onion Soup In Montreal   (Their tartares are pretty darn good too)"}
{"text":"I was here over 2 years ago, but I don't think this has changed at all based on the reviews.   This is a great place to bring anyone, date, family, big group. It's unique that it's all (mostly) outdoor with live jazz, and will always be a favourite of mine.  The food is good, not the best crepe I've ever had but the atmosphere is really inviting and a great place for lunch, or dinner.   Especially nice on a warm summer night. I also remember it was open late and one of the few places that served food at 9-10pm"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.... I wanted to love this place. It's so lovely. I saw it in the Travel Channel and the maple cake looked divine.. I ordered the seafood crepe... the middle was stone cold. Had to send it back. The maple cake was amazing !!  My husband thought his dish was just ok as well... but the atmosphere was beautiful... flowers and greens all over the walls. Maybe just go and get the sweets..."}
{"text":"Wait for food too long. Nachos were good. And setting nice and good jazz band, only reasons for stars.  Veggie pizza was literally every reject legume in their kitchen slapped onto that pizza. A ratatouille mountain.  Also my coke tasted weird and had two straws."}
{"text":"I think this place is great for drinks and some good music. The restaurant is packed to the gills, which takes away from the ambiance. I would suggest starting or ending your evening here, but skipping the place for your main meal. The beef tartare was really good (according to my husband), but my seafood crepe was both too bland and too rich at the same time. Our waiter was friendly, but overburdened with tables of impatient tourists and big families."}
{"text":"As much as Jardin Nelson is a bit of a tourist trap, it does have its charms. The large patio accommodates tons of diners seeking for \"outdoor\" dining but want to be shielded from the burning summer sun.  A live jazz band on the stage makes it seem even more happening than already exemplified by loud patrons downing pitchers of sangria and other sweet cocktails.   Despite a perpetual long line, we were seated pretty quickly. And the food is decent. My pizza was delicious. My husband's duck crepe was sweet and interesting.   If you are into people watching, and find yourself starving in the heart of Old Montreal and desperate need to find a place to eat, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at this lovely restaurant!  It has ambiance galore!!  We were treated to some soft jazz music while we ate (a bassist and piano player entertained us)."}
{"text":"Delicious! A friend took me here tonight and the first thing you notice is how gorgeous the location is.  You're actually in a garden eating outdoors (which was lovely on a day like today).  I had a crepe filled with seafood that was amazing and an ice cream sundae that was fresh and just the right size.  If you're in the area, you can't beat this location and the food was just perfect."}
{"text":"My experience at Jardin Nelson was great!  PROS: 1. Beautiful atmosphere with a wonderful live jazz band.  2. Service was very prompt! Food and drinks came out at appropriate times even though it was a full house.  3. Perfect place to take anyone: family, date, friends, etc. 4. Friendly employees who look happy to be there.  CONS: 1. Food was a tad underwhelming but still good. I had the salmon pizza which was good but lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that would have made it even better. 2. You can't make reservations, however the line-up went quickly--we waited ~15 min on a friday night.  OVERALL: -I will DEFINITELY  recommend Jardin Nelson to anyone. -I will DEFINITELY go back. -If my pizza was better I would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great terrace, if you love ribs give them a try, they fall of the bones and are so delicious  Nice place also to bring a date or have a lunch with friends with their live band music and amazing flowers baskets all over the terrace makes this place one of my favorites terraces in town"}
{"text":"Love this place! You are actually sitting in the middle of a garden with some jazz musicians playing while eating dinner. Wonderful! They have an assortment of dishes from Pizza to homemade pate chinois. I hade a frozen non alcohol margarita which was tangy on my tongue which I enjoyed! My main dish was just Asian salad with chicken which was also very tasty.. Hurry up and try it because it's only open in the summer for you to enjoy the garden"}
{"text":"Every person travelling to Montreal should try this at least once! Live music, great food! The patio space in the back is superb"}
{"text":"Run into this restaurant while wandering in old Montreal. Smoked salmon omelette casserole was awesome! We sat by the street if not for my pollen allergy would definitely sit in the backyard to enjoy the live jazz."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. My friend and I were having a wonderful time in Montreal until we came to Jardin Nelson. We told the host we were a party of two and he put us on the waitlist without asking our names. Strange, isn't it? When we got to the front of the line, we saw what he had written on the list. We were \"2 Asians.\" The women behind us were \"2 Blondes,\" and the couple behind them \"2 Old.\" Seriously? Apparently this is a routine thing here, as I didn't see any other host ask for customers' names. The manager was not apologetic when we told her what we had seen, and although she did finally say this won't happen again, I wonder if she realizes how inappropriate and offensive this is. Start asking for our names, instead of defining us by our race, age or other physical traits."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the food quality. Two pizzas and two beers were more than 60 Canadian dollars. The pizza was nothing special, the base was thick, but hard, with too much ingredients. In the end I regretted the spent money for the quality: Next time I just go head and eat real junk food, at least I know what to expect upfront."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Jardin Nelson and just love the summer ambiance. The open restaurant in the back is just stunning. Nice jazz and even better drinks. We got the brie fondue and ribs as apps and the were both amazing!  For lunch, we had pizza (good but greasy),  crepes with saddle of rabbit,  duck Shepard pie,  and Au jus beef sandwich. Cannot wait to come back to Montreal and go here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty good, we sat in an interior courtyard near the band.  Portions are not huge, and the roast beef au jus was just average.   Kind of a touristy places in old Montreal.  I wouldn't wait in a huge line for it."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! Beautiful indoor garden. as central and spacious, it's a hidden gem. Map out and get there. The fruit drink Amazon is delicious. Crepes are yum. Service is friendly.  Prices are moderate."}
{"text":"You must sit in the back courtyard/patio/garden area! It almost seems like an entirely different restaurant because it even has its own hostess stand. Lovely lovely ambiance. Live jazz trio, beautiful flowers all over the place, and big rain-catching canopies that make you feel like you are outside and inside at the same time. We had breakfast here, and the crepes and coffee were delicious too. Excellent service and decent prices."}
{"text":"An relatively inexpensive spot in the middle of a lot of pricey restaurants... complete with some outside seating. Service was excellent! The food was decent. If you're unsure where to go and don't want to get ripped off among the crowds of tourists, this may be your place. Food ranges from traditional french crepes to ribs and steaks."}
{"text":"What happened!? This place was great a few years ago, and now all of the crepe dishes taste the same as if the same sauce is used in each one...TOURIST TRAP.  The Good: - The atmosphere is still very nice with the live jazz band and indoor garden  The Bad: -The tables were very squished, the woman sitting next to me (not in my party) and I had to coordinate whenever one of us wanted to get out of our seat -Not family friendly, no options available for children -The sauces in the crepes all tasted the same, my party had the foresteire, rable de lapin, and fermiere- we had the exact same meal a few years ago and it was very delicious then...what happened to the creamy wine sauce for rabbit crepe? Why did everything taste the same now?  -The worst by far was the foresteire..the worst crepe I have ever had. It tasted like someone opened a bottle of Campbells Mushroom soup and poured it into a crepe (and even that would be more appetizing). Avoid at all costs! -Our waiter disappeared halfway through our meal and we had to continuously walk around to try to get  get another waiter to help us, really disrespectful   Overall, very disappointed with this restaurant. The atmosphere is the only reason why it is getting 3 stars."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends and I were at Old port on Canada's day and were looking for a place to eat for dinner before the fireworks. As we were outside reading the menu, a local came up to us and told us that of all the places around here, this is the place to go, and prices are reasonable. So we went in and were pleasantly surprised :)  In the garden area, is a wonderful terrace with large flower-like umbrellas, lots of beautiful flowers and brick walls. There's also a live jazz band.   Lots of great choices on the menu, but I decided to go safe and choose a salad, because it was hot out and i haven't had fruits in a couple of days. I chose la salade estivale, which came to about $18 after tax. It has a variety of fruits, cubes of feta, pork filet and two sauces. I didn't like the sauces. But i must say, the pork is extremely TENDER, and packed with flavour! I was surprised it's even pork.  Nachos were huge, i think they were soggy by the time you get half way. The goat cheese pastry appetizer is comfort food.  If you are getting dessert, you must get the biscuit géant/the giant cookie! Served on a cast iron skillet, it's a soft dough with ice cream on top. The crunch from the pecans gives it a great contrast. It's a treat worth eating the whole thing to yourself.  With the bill, comes with a rate-us-on-how-we-did card, which i appreciated. I like places who care about their service, food and how to make the customer's experience better. You know a business cares about improving when they are open to suggestions.  The environment is absolutely relaxing and entertaining and I'd like to try their french onion soup next time!"}
{"text":"The food alone might not necessarily be 5 stars, but I really think that the overall package is well worth it. My family of 9 got a table very quickly because there was ample seating, so big groups are going to be very comfortable here. The service was friendly and prompt. No finished plate stayed on the table for more than a few minutes and I always got my water on time--amazing since I pretty much inhale water when dining out. They waitress also gave us a tip on how to calculate tip--the taxes add up to be 15% of the subtotal. We usually give 20%, so it's not hard to calculate, but the advice was unprompted and so honest that it was pretty endearing.   We got:  Duck Confit Salad--probably my favorite thing that day. The duck confit was tender and flavorful and the portions of duck and salad were very balanced. The salad had ample fresh fruit and just the right amount of dressing. I just loved every bite.   Rabbit Crepe--pretty rich, but accompanied by a nice little salad that I thought cut down the richness of the dish a little.   Seafood Crepe--definitely loaded with seafood and had a prominent taste of vermouth. Surprisingly not too rich even with the cream sauce and cheese.   Beet Salad--my second favorite. This place seriously made me reconsider ordering salads at restaurants (I usually refrain). Everything tasted fresh--the most important thing about a salad--and it was tasty and very summery.   French Onion Soup--pretty flavorful but salty. I couldn't have much of it at all.   We also had a couple of other things, but I didn't get to try it. The crepes alone are a good enough portion to fill you up. It took a lot of coordination to try a piece of everything without getting too full. Definitely returning here."}
{"text":"I know this is a Montreal institution, and there's a lot to be said for the quaint and charming romanticism of the courtyard, surrounded by old stone building facades, in the heart of Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of cobblestoned Old Montreal. Add a sunny day and the soft swells of sweet music from the live jazz quartet playing on the side of the courtyard, and it's hard to find fault with such a seemingly perfect locale and environment. In fact, if I were ranking this place solely on atmosphere alone, it would rate 100 stars. It's the stuff of postcards and coffee table book photos.   But we must rank restaurants mostly on their food, and their service, and here's where this jardin loses its blooms.   It started badly. Our party of five was promptly seated at a lovely table and one of us was getting quite dehydrated (it was near 90 degrees and we had been doing a lot of walking). She immediately requested water upon being seated. The hostess said sure, and our server said she'd bring water right away. Both disappeared, not to be seen again for seemingly ages. My friend, feeling weak, eventually intercepted another server, asking - pleading - for some water (this was about 20 minutes after being seated at our table). This other server said she'd pass the message on to our server. Another 10-15 minutes elapsed. Nobody came to our table. Finally my friend got up and walked to the hostess counter to complain. Simultaneously, our server came to our table to take our orders, no waters in hand. This was a good 30 minutes after we'd been seated on a sweltering day.   The food was mediocre (except for the crepes, which were delicious). I had a \"Nordic shrimp\" appetizer which I had asked about prior to ordering (I had no idea what Nordic shrimp were, nor did anyone in my party. As it turns out, they are what we Americans call \"baby shrimp\". The waitress neglected to tell me that the shrimp would be coated in copious amounts of mayonnaise). My friend asked for a salad and the server asked if she wanted chicken or shrimp on it. My friend said neither please. They ended up charging for the salad with chicken on it. When asked, the server said it was the same price. Another friend had requested a Mediterranean crepe but with no olives, to which the server said the mixture was \"premade\" and the cannot remove the olives. (So much for freshly made dishes, eh? And customer service. They sure aim to please here - NOT). And it was pricey, too.  All in all, it was not a stellar experience. Yes, the setting is stunning but the rest of the experience, unfortunately, subpar."}
{"text":"I  loved the apple and cheese crepe here. The ambiance is great with life music and canopy tables.  This is a great brunch choice"}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is a tourist trap, but for a tourist trap, you could probably do worse.  We went on a Saturday around 2 pm, and the place was packed.  The live music was decent Sinatra-style stuff, and the garden itself was very pretty..    As for the service, it was painfully slow, and I was annoyed when the waiter asked my (Indian) parents if they wanted the curry pizza.  (They didn't.)    We started with a couple of salads for the table  They were edible, but the dressing was really acidic and poorly balanced.  In terms of entrees, everything was mediocre and drowned in way too much cheese.    I definitely wouldn't go back, but it wasn't the worst place in the world."}
{"text":"Eh--I'd say this was my least favorite meal in Montreal.  The outside terrasse wait was about 20 minutes, we were impatient and decided to eat in the front. The crepes were bizarre: I tried the \"Nelson\" and it was loaded up with a bunch of junk--apples, bacon, stuffing, cheddar cheese, mozzarella--it really didn't make any sense. My boyfriend had the Italienne pizza, again, not that fantastic but did its job.   This place is definitely a tourist trap and I wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is a beautiful venue, with an open air terrace and large tents. Birds were flying around which was kind of amusing. (Luckily, none of them pooped on us!) We didn't wait long to be seated, managing to score seats even though it was crowded.  The jazz band on-stage was good, and didn't seem too loud to me. We took a moment to relax and sip random libations. I had a glass of Orvieto Classico from Italy (C$8), a refreshing white. We shared a cold dessert, but I don't remember what it was - I did photograph it, though.  Treat yourself to a visit. Find Jardin Nelson in Old Montreal by the waterfront."}
{"text":"Beautiful beautiful place! I felt like I was in Europe (ok, maybe I also needed a vacation!) with the gardens everywhere, live music softly in the background, and ordering sangria and crepes. The appetizers we had were quite tasty: shrimp with red pepper sauce and some sort of sausage thing. The sangria was eh and my crepe was nothing super, but overall it was so pleasant an experience I was ok with my mind not being blown by every food item. Dessert was good, we shared a key lime custard thing (think: deconstructed key lime pie) and some sort of bread pudding like substance. Our waiter was very friendly and tried to be attentive as possible, though it was quite busy in there. And on a Monday! I would probably go again if I was with people who had never been to Montreal, though I'm not sure I myself would make it a point to go back on my own."}
{"text":"Had a great time here while visiting Montréal... Perfect location in old Montréal. Patio open till late night with a romantic vibe and live Jazz music! Food was innovative, though tasted okay.."}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant. En plein coeur du Vieux-Port, c'est souvent mon choix lorsque je cherche une place à manger. Si vous y allé, soyez certain d'aller faire un tour dans la terrasse arrière. C'est très grand et super espacé.  Côté bouffe, j'ai toujours pris des salages et je n'ai jamais été déçu. Ma préférée : celle avec des fruits et fêta.  Très bon rapport qualité/prix, même si c'est dans un coin touristique."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Montreal and ate at Jardin Nelson. We had the crepes, both the basilica and femierre. They were wonderful! We sat outside facing Vieux Montreal and were well served. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ahh another unique gem in Montreal! The location is fantastic and the food was super tasty.  The only downside would be that since it is relatively in the tourist area, the price might be steep.  Food: 4/5, I got the pate chinois au canard, which is simply Shepards pie with duck instead served with beets and homemade tomato ketchup. It was very good and but the main attraction of the meal was the giant cookie on a skillet with ice cream on top. I'd return next time just for the cookie.  Service: 4/5, our waitress was great, she came by often to check up on us and even though some of our friends took longer to decide, she was super patient.  Ambience: 5/5, amazing with live music and open concept feel. Even with all the noise around, it's great for conversations and comfortable seating.  Price: 2/5, around $40+ per person if you get a main dish, dessert and drinks.  The drinks and desserts were reasonably priced. The main dishes however are $20+ which is not exactly what you paid for.    Highly recommended for patio-dessert-drinks type of night and perhaps skip a meal ;)"}
{"text":"A romantic Jazzy evening @ Jardin Nelson   Nestled in the heart of old Montreal is one of the loveliest date spots I've ever been to.  The terrace area is the big attraction since they play live Jazz every evening. The restaurant has the Romantic European charm that is difficult to resist. The service was great without being intrusive and the food was absolutely delicious. The Tropical Sangria was the beverage of choice and the sweet and colorful concoction proved to be the perfect start. I tried the soup of the day; Cauliflower Curry soup and my companion ordered the Frites AU Panier (Basket of French fries). For entrée I had the Lobster mac&chesse (OMG!!!!!!!!!!, really, just fabulous!!!!!) We also ordered the Asiatique salad (Mixed lettuce, beansprouts, mandarin, snowpeas, red pepper, broccoli, Chinese noodles, preserved ginger and sesame dressing) also very delicious. This is a must go when visiting Montreal, Just Saying!!!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Prices are a bit high, but all worth it! Not a single dish was bad( look on pics) . Lovely service! Live music all day! Outdoors , multiple seating options for small or large parties! Always full house!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good service. We only had crepes so we can't give a review of the other food. Crepes were fabulous. We tried cheesecake, banana and ice cream and we all agreed the cheesecake was our favorite but all were very good."}
{"text":"Hmmm...3 words...FORTUNE COOKIE CREPES.  Blech!  Overpriced and overrated.    The serving sizes were large, but the food was mediocre at best and at over $15 for crepes...you've got to be kidding me.  The batter is overly sweet and the texture of the crepes was just plain odd!  A note about the wait staff, friendly enough, but as we sat broiling in the hot sun, he sat inside the restaurant folding napkins while our drinks ran dry.  I've been to better."}
{"text":"We enjoyed it so much, we went back the next day! The first time we went for brunch and sat in the front patio. The second time we went for lunch and sat in the back patio - the live jazz music in the back was the perfect compliment to our meal. Great place to go for all ages.   My highlights were the croque-Monsieur with smoked duck and the maple apple strudel crepe with ice cream."}
{"text":"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Live jazz music, an open-air garden setting, very good food and service."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at jardin nelson for our 3 year anniversary and we weren't disappointed. The live music was the perfect volume, the crepes were very good (I had the ham and asparagus), and the flowers with birds flitting about were lovely. Try the apple sangria!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue, came to Montreal last year for our anniversary getaway and wanted to sit and listen to jazz music after a long day of walking around the city, thanks to yelpers and i found this place. First time we came in it was a Friday night, the wait was excruciating after an hour wait we end up leaving our spot on the line and went somewhere else,  second time our luck is much better we came in very late i think it was almost midnight and waited about 5 minutes and got seated few rows from the stage where they have band playing jazz music, we ordered desserts and coffee, food was ok, its the ambience and the music that sell me out... the Crepe although savory i feel like it is too dry, could have more sauce on it or something. But definitely be back the next time i'm back to lovely Montreal!"}
{"text":"To add to what many reviewers said, location is wonderful, the outdoor seating and live jazz is quite possibly the biggest value of this place.  Food is alright, nothing terribly impressive, but still good.   Service is polite and respectful, it's always nice to see some warmth towards American guests.   Music is beautiful and the seating so comfortable, we could've sat there for hours ordering drinks. Definitely an evening place to be, though I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"While in Montreal visiting my boy who is a senior at McGill we happened to walk into Jardin Nelson after wandering through the old port section. I ordered the avocado toast and my son the croque monsieur with smoked duck and emmental sandwich. We had to come back the following day to further explore the menu. This time it was the cannelloni for me and the roast beef sandwich for my son. Both days we ordered different salads to go along; the food was prepared with care, the presentation flawless, the service attentive and prompt even thought the second day the place was packed. The jazz band provided a beautiful background music for the great ambiance in courtyard, it was Spring in Montreal and Jardin Nelson made it perfect."}
{"text":"So, I wasn't feeling well when we went here which was a shame because everyone else enjoyed their meals and I couldn't eat my plate clean.  The atmosphere is fun. It's outside and they have coverings for a little drizzle or showers.    The music was a good background noise.  But we came for great crepes and weren't disappointed.  The rabbit in the crepes was a big hit but there were plenty of other dishes we had that we big hits too.  It's not the \"best\" meal we've had but this is definitely an ambiance outside place where the food merely needs to be good for this place to succeed.  It was more than that and it's worth the visit.    And the best part is that we got seated right away! When does that happen?!!"}
{"text":"Went with family of four.  All went as expected and the outside dining is beautiful.  Lobster roll was better than expected as was service.  Family does not agree with me, but they are wrong. :)"}
{"text":"What a magical atmosphere.  It really is all about the environment with this place, with the jazz band and all the flowers on the walls, but the food was pretty good too.  The service was friendly, and I loved the blue sangria."}
{"text":"Viem ze ide asi o dost turisticku zalezitost, ale do tohto miesta som sa zblaznila. Ta uzasna zahrada, tie kvety, ta architektura, ta hudba, jednoznacne ma dostali.  Prisli sme sem na bielu sangriu, ktorá bola pre m?a prekvapením. Nakoniec sme skoncili s tou s príchu?ou lichee a bola skuto?ne skvelá. Jedálny lístok je ve?mi rozírený a turistický. Pizza ktorá nás napríklad prekvapila bola mexická s fazu?ami. Po?as celého ve?era nám príjemne vyhrávala jazzová kapela a servis fi?al bez chybi?ky.   Ur?ite by som sa vrátila zas, hlavne kvôli atmosfére a jrásne vyrieenej záhrade."}
{"text":"It is expensive but on par with Old Montreal rates. But lets be honest, you go here for the atmosphere first and the food second. And it would be tourists that go here so they don't really care about the price.   Atmosphere: You have to sit outside. It was raining what we went, but the upside down umbrellas catch the rain to keep you dry. There are a couple places where the rain enters the patio area but it isn't a big deal and it is kinda fun to watch the servers walking with umbrellas so not to get your food wet.   Service: The service was some of the best I have ever received. They were friendly and accommodating. I asked to have the forest crepe with something other than the chicken sauce that came with it and they didn't have a problem with this.   Food: Delicious and eye-appealing.   Price: I said that it is costly... and it is... but it is not too over the top. It was actually cheaper than the hotel I was staying at. So for the great presentation, and wonderful atmosphere it was worth trying."}
{"text":"Most Romantic Spot in Montreal! Go to the second host's stand so that you can be seated in the garden. We went twice. Even when it was raining, their beautiful massive umbrella-like machinery protected us and the jazz musicians kept playing and singing."}
{"text":"A MUST COME in Montreal! It's a really good restaurant with great service and quality food. Prices are not cheap but it's worthy it!!"}
{"text":"On my first trip to Montreal (4th Of July weekend 2014) Jardin De Nelson was one of our dining stops. We had walked up and down the street trying to decide where to eat and I am so grateful we ended up deciding on this one.  We sat in the outdoor garden, which was overflowing with flowers and plants. Directly across from us was the Jazz band. The music was perfect as was the food and service. I wish I had a place like this near me.  My sister and i ordered the Diva our friend the Florentine. Our meals were perfect. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal for a weekend, stop by this cute spot for a yummy brunch. It's right in the heart of old Montreal and a great place to explore. We passed by Saturday evening and noticed a long line, so decided to stop by early the next day for brunch. We got there a little after opening and had no wait. The inside is absolutely adorable, true to the name, just like a garden. They also had live jazz music playing!   At first, I wasn't too impressed by the brunch menu, but I decided to settle on an salmon, egg, goat cheese omelette/casserole. It was really flavorful and creamy and came with nicely seasoned potato wedges. My friend got the apple strudel with fruit, also delicious but very very sweet!  Overall experience was pleasant. Had friendly service and good food. Go for the ambience and experience. Quick tip, If you want to save money go for brunch as the menu options are cheaper than their regular full menu."}
{"text":"\"Enjoyable lunch in the Garden\"  Perfect place to stop for lunch after our morning Vieux Montreal walking tour.  Only about 5 minute wait to get in and we had a nice table in the back gardens area.  Extensive food and drink menu.  My crepe (mushroom and cheeses) and wife's salad fit the bill. However you are there( in our case to) enjoy the music and singer, and the delighful ambiance in the gardens.  Even though the place is packed service was attentive and we never felt crowed or rushed.  A great place to break the day between activities.      Visited July 2016"}
{"text":"Lovely Euro type place! Take your loved ones and enjoy the atmosphere and the food, I don't think it's a great place if you want a quick meal, just you need the time to sit and relax and enjoy the food, the crepes and cocktails are my favorite"}
{"text":"Have you ever smelled a bird's armpit?  Well, now I can say I have. Annoying menu where salads are not salads but noodle dishes.  Jazz is waaaayyyyyyyy too loud. If you even think volume is going to be an issue for you,  avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"It was a gorgeous summer's evening last week when my girlfriends and I met up for dinner at Jardin Nelson. I had passed the beautiful botanical restaurant many times when exploring the Old Port but never had a chance to try it.  As this restaurant does not accept reservations, we queued up in a long line for about 40 minutes! Once entering through the leafy doorway, it was evident that this place was definitely worth the wait. From the outside it looks very small as you can only see a few tables on the exterior terrasse. However, once you go through the entrance, it is huge inside, a vast open courtyard circled by two levels with lots of tables! On Saturday evening, it was completely packed by couples, families and friends... This restaurant is a perfect setting for any type of adult gathering.  I immediately fell in love with the gorgeous ambiance... It was like walking into an enchanted garden surrounded by greenery and pretty flowers, whilst the melody of soft live jazz music filled the air.  Our table was located by a huge tree that stands over the restaurant and is decorated with tiny lights - under a summer evening sky, it really was the perfect setting for a delicious meal.  Now on to the food. For appetizers we had the Nachos Nelson, roasted shrimps and fries basket. For a group of 4 girls, we were unable to finish! The nachos portion is huge and very very filling. I have never had nachos like this before... An entire layer of 3 cheese melted together over crispy nachos which lay on a bed of cranberry salsa and beans... So good I could have it as an entire meal! The fries were presented in a tiny deep fryer basket which was cute but quite a small portion.  For the main course we shared the Du Marché pizza and Eggplant al forno. The pizza was a mixed vegetable pizza, tasty but let down by the artichoke which I felt did not work with the rest of the flavours. The oven baked eggplant was interesting - very fresh whole eggplant baked for some time with cheese and tomato sauce. Worth trying if you are an aubergine fan!  The restaurant prides itself in its vast selection of drinks so I opted for the Fruité mocktail which was a combination of sweet and tangy.   Overall, I had a wonderful meal and experience at Jardin Nelson. For a moment, it gives the feeling as if you are somewhere magical and far away from the noise and bustle of city life and construction. The ingredients definitely were very fresh and cooked to perfection. Our waitress was extremely hospitable and courteous which made us not want to leave the place. Despite it being a popular touristic spot, I definitely recommend it to local Montréalers. Cannot wait to visit this secret garden again!"}
{"text":"House of the Rising Sun, Crazy, done very so nicely by a live jazz band over brunch (I think I like jazz now). Food was terrific. Waiter insisted I not tip him because the eggs came a bit  late.  And he comped the fish. A lovely spot. Choose the garden in back instead of the street."}
{"text":"Longue attente mais ça va le coup. Belle ambiance avec le band derrière. Joli jardin. Les crèpes sont bonnes. Ma mère avait oublié ses lunettes de soleil hors de prix. Lorsqu'on a appellé le lendemain, ils l'ont trouvé et les avaient gardées. Merci"}
{"text":"This is a must see when you are in MTL! Don't miss it! Romantic patio seating awaits you in this hidden gem with a live jazz band every night. You have to make time to eat here!"}
{"text":"Truly surprised this place has so many good reviews because the crepes are mediocre at best. I was also surprised at the lack of variety of the menu. They seem to have slight deviations of the same crepe. Our dessert crepe was the worst part of or meal. Just not very appetizing. The ambiance and garden are nice but surely not worth the wait. Definite tourist trap.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Grey cold and misty weather. Glad to have a nice covered spot to watch the plaza. Nice wide menu of food options. Attentive waitstaff."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Jardin Nelson and we enjoyed our experience very much!  I went with a pesto chicken crepe while my fiancé enjoyed a mushroom crepe.  The only thing that kept our experience from 5 stars was the sangria which was very weak and more sprite than sangria.  We weren't feeling a thing after going through the pitcher."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly what I wanted when I imagined dining in Old Montreal. In the heart of Place de Jacques-Cartier, the Jardin Nelson is situated in a beautiful courtyard. The food fresh and unique and the live jazz is icing on the cake!  TIP: Timing is key! When we tried to eat here on a Saturday night there was a line around the block, but when we came back on Sunday morning (around noon, right at the end of brunch reservations, when the restaurant goes first come, first serve), we were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere!  The white sangria tasted more like a drink made up of juice than anything. They had live music for you to listen to which as enjoyable.  I was with a group of 6 girls and 2 of us were shat on while we were sitting outside. Not that I'm dropping their stars as a result, but just something to be aware of as two out of 6 was already high percentage.  Service was just like everywhere else in the city - quick initially, then after your first round they don't follow up with you."}
{"text":"We came here because it was there and we were with a friend that lives in Montreal. It's a nice place with out door seating and our waitress was friendly. We ordered drinks, appetizer, and food.  As an appetizer, we had nachos which were AMAZING! As a matter of fact, they weren't your typical nachos... they tasted like pizza!!!  The Tokyo Iced Tea is a MUST TRY! I downed that thing in a minute and you didn't even taste the alcohol.  We ordered a tropical drink, not sure what it was called and that too was good.   I wasn't too thrilled with my Crepe (I ordered one with chicken) but it was still good!"}
{"text":"Located in Old Montreal close to the Old Port, this restaurant was one of our highlights while on vacation.  We enjoyed a wonderful brunch with live jazz in their beautiful garden. The menu is extensive and features lots of freshly made items and the service is attentive.  Most at our table had crepes (they are famous for them) while I had a delicious salad with field greens, beets, goat cheese, nuts and lots of other goodies.  We had a ringside seat to a 3 piece combo and lovely singer.    This restaurant is a must for a fun Sunday Brunch if you are in Montreal and nearby after April, 2014. They are currently undergoing off season renovations."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful time we went twice!  Both times we had the white sangria and nachos.  Both times we listened to wonderful music for about an hour!   Service was great....as waste ambiance.  Go!"}
{"text":"We had such a lovely dinner and lovely experience here. We sat outside in the courtyard, next to the band. It wasn't loud there, in fact, it was perfect. The food was just as enjoyable as the music. I had an amazing poke salad, and my husband had the steak tartare. The sangria comes in many flavors - we had a small pitcher of the rosé/peach, which was delightful!"}
{"text":"Har en ganska trevlig uteplats på innergården. Liveband på kvällen. Vällagad mat och trevlig service. Rikligt med grönsaker på veg. pizzan: Jättegod! Hummersalladen rekommenderas också. Montreals specialitet: bagles och lax, var mindre lyckad som val. Stark trea!"}
{"text":"I visited Jardin Nelson last summer on Memorial Day weekend. I fell in love with the atmosphere, service, and food! Jazz music is sultry, it's like drinking a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter's day. It's creamy, chocolatey, and warm like a hug from an old friend. I felt like Alice in Wonderland and I walked into a Secret Garden restaurant. Canadians truly are such kind and considerate people. Every waitress/waiter I encountered spoke French and English. Montreal was a little European adventure that was only five hours north of Boston. It was such a lovely experience, everyone must venture here !  Bonus: In current time, the CAD is worth less than USD, so it's slightly cheaper for Americans when they visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing location, great food and a cool ambiance.   There was a jazz band playing while we were here. The food was very tasty and the service was excellent.   We sat out in the patio and had a grand time."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot to enjoy a glass of wine while you listen to live jazz. The crepes were divine and the staff was very attentive. A must if you come to old Montreal!"}
{"text":"During our weekend stay in Montreal, my fiancée just happen to find this place by chance and I am very happy she did. We sat in the back and were instantly wowed by the looked of the place. The band was also playing very suitable music that really enhanced the atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly and we ordered two dessert crepes for breakfast. I had an apple crepe and my fiancée had a chocolate crepe. Both were so amazing!   The prices are really reasonable too, it was definitely the highlight of our trip to Montreal. You need to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Most people who are visiting Montreal will visit Old Montreal and this place is terrific to grab a bite when you are there. If you are lucky and can get a table outside - you can enjoy the roadside shows along with the food. In case it is cold, the heaters installed on the porch outside will keep you warm.  The food was awesome ... I had salmon chowder for the first time ... I was a bit worried if the soup will smell right ... it did and it was absolutely fantastic. I could not put my spoon down until I finished the entire cuppa salmon chowder! The freshly squeezed orange juice was a treat! Crepes and salads were also yummm!  Good food along with the view of tourists getting their caricatures done, juggelers, musicians etc was a delight."}
{"text":"Nice location in a central square.  Average food, but decent for a lunch place. Hospitable staff. Overall, just another meal that didn't blow me out of the water."}
{"text":"My family was traveling to Montreal. After a long morning of walking around Old Montreal, we decided to stop some place for lunch. Unfortunately, most of the restaurants weren't open yet...except for Jardin Nelson. The patio out front was completely full and there was a line to get in. We were quickly seated in the terrace/garden. It was absolutely beautiful! The ambience was great. There was live jazz music and it wasn't too loud. It was a little hard to communicate with the waiter (we are from the U.S. and do not speak any French), but he tried his best. I felt a little bit rushed to order, so I didn't get a chance to truly look at the huge menu. I ended up ordering French onion soup and a Caesar salad. The soup was absolutely delicious! The salad was a bit overdressed but delicious nonetheless.  Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The establishment at Jardin Nelson need not thank me for writing my first review. I am well aware that this is my first here. Their blatant discriminatory practice forced me to do so. My husband and I were on our honeymoon. While touring Vieux Montreal we decided to find an establishment to dine, wine and hear some jazz. Jardin seemed to have some decent reviews. It was too be an early dinner on a Monday in August. The place was not yet crowed. Upon entering, my husband, who is white and me who is black Haitian, were directed to a table in the back. As the place was not crowded and we noted a few families with young children around our intended section, we politely asked to be seated upstairs. The hostess paused and almost reluctantly took us up the stairs to a quieter section that seemed to have been reserved for more desired clientele. I should note that upon coming in we did see a black family seated off the side near the front entrance. The clientele around us were all white and seemingly of the Fifth Avenue/ Rue Sherbrooke type. I should note that my husband and I are professionals who could hold are own too. However, it seems that we were the wrong combination platter. To make a long story short, we sat at our upstairs table,  with menu in hands, for over 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the empty tables around us where beginning to fill up with the right clientele who were immediately given water and their drinks of choice. My husband and I waited. Five different waiters passed us to see to the needs of others. A woman,  who we later found out was the manager, even saw us sitting there and went about doing other things. I knew something was us but said nothing, not even to my husband; least i be branded the angry black woman. Finally my husband, who is usually the first to err on the side of goodness,  noted the blatant oversight. He asked a passing server to see a manager. When the manager arrived she gave an excuse about the changing in staff. We then noted that people who can after us were already handled. She apologize perfunctorily, but failed to acknowledged the blatant oversight by her staff. I then said her excuses are unacceptable. I said this situation merits a review. She then waived us away and says, \"well go ahead and write your review\". It was embarrassing as other guest had noted the blatant neglect too. As we walked out, we saw a new girl at the stand who wished us a good day. We briefly explained we had not eaten and why. She apologized, but the damage was done. My poor husband was apologetic and nearly tearful. I explained to him this is the perils of being black in an Anglo Franco World. We took a taxi back to our hotel. We will not do Vieux Montreal again. The area restaurants don't really welcome diversity. The discrimination at the Jardin Nelson was systemic. Don't waste your money in that pretty poison."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our hotel concierge and it was a great suggestion. I went all French and for their French onion soup (which was a HUGE PORTION) and then the French dip which was excellent. Our server was super nice and the old town area around the restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"Our guide recommended this place because of the terrace garden. The garden terrace is quite beautiful with very larg unusual umbrellas that catch rain water. We had the Boreale beer which is a local beer. My favourite was the rouge. The IPA isn't too bad either. We had the calamari and it wasn't the best but good enough. They have patio heaters so it was quite cozy."}
{"text":"The most beautiful terasse in Montreal! They have the best sangria and the live music creates the perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for what they were offering but I can't say I was over impressed with my meal at Jardin Nelson.  I think my main issue was the cost and value of what you were getting.  A lot of the dishes were pretty pricey for a lunch meal and I didn't find the portions included a lot of food.  It is in a touristy spot of Old Montreal and it is the highest rated restaurant in the area so I guess if you are in that location, it may be your best choice but I wouldn't go out of my way to go eat there.  There also seems to be a difference in style if you are eating on the patio or if you are eating inside.  Inside seems fancier with music playing and a nicer decor so since you are paying the same price regardless of where you eat, maybe the inside is the better choice.  In terms of service, while our server was prompt, she never brought us bread which every other table had so that was definitely a mistake.  All in all it was disappointing considering the reviews but maybe it would have been better choosing the inside rather than the patio."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so magical ! They have a live Jazz band and beautiful flowers surrounding the windows, it's overall just really pretty and easy to enjoy. The food was great too. I ordered the Forestiere Crepe (mushroom) with their Orange Juice De Luxe (freshly squeezed) and then Pomme Sucre Crepe for dessert (Apple and maple) which were all great and filling."}
{"text":"Picture a cool autumn night, sitting under a giant tarp with lush greenry all around you, sipping a fine drink, enjoying a bite of cheesecake, while a smooth jazz band plays some wicked Ella Fitzgerald in front of you.  Got it?  Then welcome to Jardin Nelson."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience with outdoor seating and a live jazz band. Excellent hospitality.  We tried the melon sangria which was light and refreshing and something different.  And, loved the food... We ordered the cheese pastry, chicken liver patte and eggplant forna bake.  The food was delish!!!! We were very happy with the whole experience."}
{"text":"On my first to Montreal with my gf we came here to eat a nice mid day lunch before walking around more and departing from Montreal. Now obviously i am one that has a love/hate relationship with spots that are touristy and well known but in this case it was worth it. I liked the fact that we walked down a nice cobblestone corridor then was greeted by the hostess who promptly showed us to our table. Our seating was right in front where they had two jazz players performing throughout the lunch playing soft melodies for all of the diners entertainment and i always believe with soothing music a meal is always made more enjoyable.   Looking around this was definite a place i could fall in love with, beautiful flower bed arrangements with different colors that made the restaurant really pop, the large umbrella's which provided a nice cool atmosphere and most importantly shade, plus birds flying around during the meal and  nicely arranged plants i loved the ambiance. The food on the other hand could be improved, with such a nicely designed restaurant i would expect a vast selection, also my gf suggested that when your in a new place you should try new food and i 100% agree with that, but in this case i should have just gotten the salmon, because everything else i looked at on the menu, i just was not feeling. Had the veal meatballs style dish and it wasn't that great i'd say it was at best a 6 out of 10 if i had to grade it. But overall the decor/ambiance made up for that. Plus our waitress was extremely helpful/friendly. I also agree with some of the reviews a bit overpriced for what they were serving."}
{"text":"Went on a Sat. night in July. Romantic. Dimly lit at night. Great for groups. Bustling scene. An elevated stage where a jazz band performed. Seating out by street level,indoors and out back with high ceilings. Food was good. Would return."}
{"text":"Building is spectacular and service was friendly. Food was mediocre, if I'm being generous, and expensive. It is in the right place and does the job. Patio is wonderful on a good evening but this is your basic tourist trap."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the mojitos and the lobster mac and cheese !! Enjoyed every sip and every bite . The garden look is to die for .. great ambience with lovely life jazz in the back yard ..."}
{"text":"Went to Jardin Nelson for early dinner at 5pm on a Saturday. The place was already packed and quite a long line with people waiting to be seated. We picked this place based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The 4 of us shared 2 appetizers, a pizza and a chocolate crepe. The portion was small. So if you are hungry and want to share you should order the full dinner portion instead of appetizers. We liked everything we ordered but our favorite was definitely the ribs. The order was kind of on the slow side but service was good. Definitely will go back if I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience at Jardin Nelson! The restaurant is an open air restaurant with live jazz music. It's quite busy. My girlfriend and I went there on a Wednesday and people were still arriving at 10:00pm. I had the Saddle of Rabbit Crepe and my girlfriend had the Seafood Crepe. Really enjoyed both. The hostess at the front was a bit rude. Otherwise, a great experience!"}
{"text":"An excellent spot to have a drink and take in some live jazz in the summer  Really does have the feel of a garden, but I don't recommend the food."}
{"text":"Pros - located in old Montreal historic area close I water  - live jazz in back area on weekend  - outdoor seating in front and back surrounded by flowers - servers are friendly   Cons - food is below average  Would not come back unless for a drink and for live jazz band"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of my favorite spots in Montreal. Set in a beautiful garden with live jazz playing, it was such a romantic and elegant atmosphere. The menu was plentiful and had everything for our group of 8 girls to  choose from. French onion soup is an extremely large portion, so if you do order that, I would recommend sharing. My dish was the Lobster Salad which was the most divine salad I have had in a long time. I would have come back to eat it again the next time I am able to be in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food was much tastier and beautifully presented than I was expecting from this touristy restaurant. We sat in the very large back garden patio which is quite pretty and gave us a break from the wind in the streets that day, but still allowing us to sit outside. The jazz duo happened to be a bit cheesy that day but pleasant as background music, playing jazz versions of many pop songs.  We got the duck confit salad, which was delicious as well as the baked eggplant casserole, which I recommend as a dish to share between several people. It is way too big for one or even two people to share. This would be a great restaurant to accommodate groups of 6 or more and to go with your family. There is plenty of room and the kitchen is clearly experienced and prepared for large numbers of guests."}
{"text":"Ambiance, Food, Drinks and Service all get an A++!  Ambience: Ask to be seated in the back near the jazz.  It's a very open courtyard with flower arrangements everywhere, lighted trees, heating lamps and a jazz stage.  The music is 50s/60s jazz standards.  It's pretty, cozy and elegant all at once!  Drinks: a little pricey, but I enjoyed my cider with black currant - fun new drink!  Food: We started with the fondue (brie and pesto); it's pretty tastey and enough to share for 4 people.  For my entree I ate the duck confit salad - this is no ordinary salad. Juicy, flavorful duck with a tart raspberry demi-glace, the salad is similar to panera's strawberry poppyseed with a peppery twist - all in all, a DELICIOUS MEAL that leaves room for one of their MANY desserts.  My mother enjoyed her duck crepe and my brother REALLY enjoyed his Crepe Nelson (apple pie, bacon, cheese and maple syrup - tastes like breakfast!).   Dessert: The cheesecake crepe is delicious! It's served warm with strawberries. It's definitely enough for two (or 3...).  Service: Friendly and attentive; no complaints.  Definitely worth a dinner trip!"}
{"text":"came into town for one day after a week long cruise from boston.  stayed at the embassy suites (would definitely give it a thumbs up).  There are a lot of expensive restaurants in the area.  I was traveling with a family of 10 (grandparents and grandkids).  Needed a restaurant with a nice atmosphere, reasonable prices and good selection on the menu.  This restaurant fit the bill.  Ask to sit in the garden area, not street side."}
{"text":"This is a cute touristy place to check out during the summer months.  The seating is courtyard like, no roof but large canopies block out much of the sun and they have industrial heaters to keep the area warm. It was still open in early September which was nice.  The prices are a little on the higher side. If I remember correctly, most of the savory crepes run in the $16 range.  We were there for lunch and enjoyed the pottage du jour (a broth based vegetable soup), the Pizza American (personal size pizza with cheese and pepperoni) and my husband had the Roast beef au jous which he enjoyed. The service was good although rather impersonal.  They had an excellent live band who played a lot of the standards and some Nora Jones hits. A nice place with ambiance, decent food but prices a little steep."}
{"text":"The food was great, the atmosphere was awesome, and our waiter was a pure gem!  Made us feel like we were the only customers in the place.  LOVE the ambience and the live jazz.  So happy we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Love the service and atmosphere! The food are surprising, but taste average like homemade. The dessert pudding is so satisfying although it's a bit too sweet and heavy. But, who cares as long as u sit in a beautiful restaurant and ready to dig in! I would come to the restaurant very often. No need to worry about getting an awful dish."}
{"text":"Eating al fresco, sipping coffee, nibbling on local cheeses, this is what I expected visiting Old Montreal, and this is exactly what I got at Jardin Nelson.  The courtyard was full, so we sat on the patio, but we were still able to hear the piano jazz over the loudspeakers and watch people walk by in the summer sun.  I had a bright, crisp house salad with a tangy vinaigrette dressing, the roast beef sandwich au jus, and the local cheese plate.  The food was good and worthwhile; I had no complaints, and have had far worse food for much higher prices.  But the atmosphere was stellar -- and that's why I ate here in the first place.  I recommend Jardin Nelson for anyone who wants to sit back, relax, and watch Old Montreal before their eyes."}
{"text":"Good food and prices. Okay music, great space in the courtyard. Accomidating staff."}
{"text":"All I can say is...Pouding Chômeur...order it and you'll love it..."}
{"text":"Very good place, family friendly.  The nachos are ORGANIC, which is a HUGE deal to my family.  It is so beautiful to sit outdoors and protected from the elements.  This is the third year going to eat there and it is just as good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance with a nice jazz band & a beautiful setting, drinks are ok but the food leaves a lot to be desired... Not awful just overpriced for the quality and flavours.  Would recommend to go for drinks!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and was very pleased. I got the orange and cranberry pancakes with cheesecake and ricotta cheese. It was fabulous. As much as this sweet dish tickled my tongue, my wife's not so sweet dish was what really blew me away. She got a crepe with salami, onions, tomato sauce, and something else I can't recall. I was so delish. Great spot for brunch. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a sixth star for its amazing atmosphere, I would!  This restaurant has a live jazz band every night, and that is only the tip of the amazing decor.  The restaurant has an outdoor concept, with second floor seating around the outside.  On this day, we ordered the French onion soup to start, and had the curry crepe and duck crepe for entrees.  The crepes were pretty good by themselves, and the soup was a perfect blend of cheese and bread, with quite a large portion.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Old Montreal."}
{"text":"First, you *must* sit in the back patio area. Live, mellow jazz standards fill a charming, multi-level, covered cobblestone patio that is decorated with flowers and xmas lights. Charming. The food was good, though maybe not as good as the reviews led us to believe. The waiter seemed a little remote but we had a fine time, chillaxing in our final hours before heading out to the airport."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson Restaurant is hands down best food in Old Montreal! Everything we tried is simply insane. The sangria is a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Old Montreal. Great location right off Place Jacques Cartier, the main tourist street with lots of street artists in the warmer months. Huge beautiful courtyard restaurant with a live jazz band playing while eating delicious crepes....it doesn't get better. They have a great menu of crepe options that are all amazing, I've had several over the years and I'm always happy with my choice. Sadly they're closed in the winter, probably because it's hard to get people to eat in an open air restaurant when it's -30 outside, go figure. The lines can be a bit long since it attracts both locals and the swarms of tourists in that area, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great location for locals and visitors to have a bite to eat in the day or evening. Right in the center of old Montreal. They often have a live jazz band which I found not too disruptive if you're trying to have a conversation. A quick note that I found unfortunate is if u are ordering crepes most of them have cheese in them and you can't asked to remove the cheese. There is still a selection but expect a limited choice of crepes if u can have cheese."}
{"text":"Le jardin Nelson est une superbe terrasse au cur du vieux port, sur la place Jacques Cartier. L'ambiance vaut le détour, arbres, fleurs, groupes de jazz, etc.  Je suis un peu tiraillé pour cet avis, car l'emplacement, l'ambiance est extraordinaire, malheureusement la nourriture mériterait une mise à jour. Pour le prix, c'est très dommage, car cela ruine de beaucoup l'expérience.   Ma recommandation, Le jardin Nelson est une magnifique terrasse à apprécier, pour la nourriture un dessert est intéressant."}
{"text":"My husband and I were big fans of this place, not only for the great food, service, and jazz but for the experience as a whole. We sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a Friday night) and marveled at the design of the place. The giant, umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers. The south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden. The sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic evening. Now the food: we started with the Estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course, had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe. The pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there! The crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal). For dessert, we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible. It was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectly. One of the things I really liked seeing was that on the comment card, there was a question for rating price/quality ratio. Indeed, this place had an excellent price/quality ratio! They could easily charge more, for the setting, for the jazz, for the food but they don't. Very respectable!  For a perfect romantic summer evening, this is it!  Highly recommended. We would totally go back."}
{"text":"Yes, the outdoor dinning area is nice and romantic, and the live music is great.... but that is all about it. My husband and I each had a crepe (the one with the duck and the one with rabbit) and they were a little disappointing, Not only by the look, but also by the taste and the price! The batter they use is more like a cheap pre-made waffle batter mix. The portion is not that big. It came with a little slaw that was topped with cheap Kraft dressing. And really, 2 crepes for $41!! It is kind or overpriced considering the poor ingredients they are using. If you want to cut corners in your quality, you should maybe cut down the price too. We were thinking of having dessert, but the waitress didn't even refill our water once, so we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Call ahead to make sure they are open. Their website says \"From May 1st, the Jardin Nelson welcomes you into its courtyard seven (7) days a week, regardless of weather\". After reading reviews on Yelp and checking their website, I went for dinner on May 3rd and they were closed."}
{"text":"Umm holy crap that rabbit crepe was good! nuff said  Oh yes, the service was excellent, live jazz was fantastic and indoor/outdoor venue with a fountain was really pretty. Did I mention the crepes? Merci!"}
{"text":"Great place in a heart of Old Montreal. Food is fresh and delicious, life jazz band if fantastic. Prices are reasonable considering location.  Try their signature desert."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews, I had been eyeing this place for several days. I finally went here for brunch on the day before flying home. I ordered the Nelson crepe and my bf got the smoked salmon and goat cheese egg casserole. Everything was very delicious and fulfilling. If the prices were a little more reasonable, I would definitely give this restaurant 5 stars. The bill was a little steep for 2 dishes and an orange juice, especially for brunch. the service was very good and the hostess was a very sweet and accommodating lady.  I would go here again and sit in the adorable outdoor space. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food and drink were good. I like the music and the decor is soo beautiful . Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Great good, great band, great garden. Bit expensive, onion soup is the best, they also have Leffe beer"}
{"text":"The terrace is worth it. This is a nice place to come for some drinks and a light meal, the drinks are good and not too expensive, and the food is acceptable, although more in line for brunch than a full on lunch or dinner, lots of salads, and crepes. My one complaint is about the live music, while I love live jazz, it's often so loud in the enclosed terrace, that it can be hard to speak with table mates."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very good food! Live music! What else do you need to spend a good time!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Backyard terrace, and so does everyone else apparently, so expect a waiting line at all times lol. It goes by pretty fast though.  The ambiance is so romantic and green/natural, the live Jazz band is perfect, the kind of band I've always dreamed of hearing at a restaurant. Smooth.  The waiters are all hot and fit, which surprisingly adds to the appearance of this place, maintained and polished.  Our waiter was a bit of a weirdo, couldn't crack a smile, but he was still nice.  The price is pricey lol in general for the meals, but you can still find a drink or dessert worth the trip, if, like me, you're looking to share a snack with some friends for the evening.  The place was so nice it was hard to leave, even after we paid our bill. Even though there was a lineup, no one ever rushed us out, and I really appreciated that! That was worth the price in itself.   So take your time and enjoy the scenery, evening colors and smooth music. Lovely, all throughout the day! Ill be coming back for all special occasions."}
{"text":"C'est tellement beau, comment ne pas tomber en amour avec le restaurant ? Il faut vous dépêcher si vous voulez l'essayer, il ferme le 4 septembre!   La terrasse est superbe! Et l'ambiance avec le band live et vraiment nice! Nous sommes allés pour déjeuner et c'était délicieux! Ma crêpe aux oeufs et saucisses était super et le burrito de mon copain était tout aussi bon!  Je vous le suggère, ne serait-ce que pour prendre un verre dans le Vieux-Port! Trop trop charmant!"}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal from May to September this place is a must. Doing dining hours it has long lines. They have no ceilings, just walls inside. I know it sounds strange but between the big umbrella's the rain doesn't matter. The patio outside is covered. I also saw heaters in case it's chilly. One reason for limited hours. Not a bad meal on the menue. If you like Jazz around six in the evening a really good jazz band plays. They even went out of their way when we requested something they didn't have in the case, and by the next set found the music sheet for the request. No matter what you must have the dessert. Take it with you if you don't have room. Never had a bad meal, it's also good if you want to sit on the patio and have a drink and appetizer. So get in when they are open, try eating earlier or expect a wait."}
{"text":"Excellent date or group lunch or dinner place very suitably located in Jacques Cartier square in Montreal (old town). They have beautiful flower pots everywhere with heat lamps and live band playing on summer evenings. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and it was the best. Pizza was excellent. Truly romantic and hip ambience that helps you get relaxed as you should be on a vacation. Our waitress was also very sweet."}
{"text":"What a gem.  The live jazz, great server, fresh drinks and crepes were to die for here.  The courtyard patio that is mostly covered but still gives you the fresh air experience is one of the best I've ever sat on.  The prices are a bit steep but the entire experience was worth it because when we were eating there was live jazz playing all through the afternoon.  A great spot, one of my favourite places now in Montreal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best French onion soup in town!  The Beef dip sandwich is pretty darn good also!  We came for a nice Saturday strolling around old Montreal and were not disappointed as per usual although we we're seated at one of the more boring tables at the beginning of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"After a long day of walking around Montreal, we were so tired and hungry.  There are many choices of places to eat in Old Town, but as it gets late there aren't so many.  This one was open and I happened to have been recommended by a friend.  So, we sat down.  We had a beet salad that may have included the most beets I've ever seen on a salad.  Typically beet salads have much more greens...but not this one...which was basically a \"beet dump\", if you will.  It was tasty, but nothing exceptional.  We also had bruchetta, which was okay.  So, overall...it gets an A-OK rating.  Not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Great spot in the old Montreal. The atmosphere in the back outdoor garden area is unparalleled. It's like a garden paradise, with plants lining the 3-story brick facade covered by giant umbrellas, so you can sit outside even if it rains! The place has good food and doesn't seem too touristy.  The French onion soup is amazing. The baked cannelloni was excellent as was the French dip au jus. It was so good we came back two nights in a row!"}
{"text":"The courtyard dining of Jardin Nelson is gorgeous, it's like dining in the middle of a garden.   Our table location took away from the atmosphere though.  We sat right on the edge of a patio, where we saw the line building at the hostess stand.  The entire meal felt rushed, from watching the impatient line building to the delivery of our food and check.  Don't expect to lounge on the terrace enjoying cocktails.  That's OK though, the mojito I had could have been better.  The food was good:  I had the Roast Beef sandwich with horseradish.  The sandwich was a fair portion, and the roast beef was tender.  The sandwich came with fries, which weren't anything special.  My husband had the Charcuterie Pizza.  The crust was good, but he was disappointed in the pizza's toppings:  each quarter of the pizza had a different topping, rather than the four toppings on the entire pizza.  It seemed skimpy.  I think our two entrees, a cocktail, and a beer totaled around $60.  I just wasn't impressed with Jardin Nelson. I can accept overpriced restaurants in touristy areas, but there's no excuse for subpar food, drinks, and service."}
{"text":"I only had the sangria but I give it 5 stars already just because of the atmosphere. It's like walking into a modern day Gatsby hangout. The classic jazz and garden decor lures you right in. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Formidable! Excellent restaurant with an outdoor and indoor feel. The crêpes are awesome. For lunch the small pitcher of red sangria was perfect for me. Area is great for walking off the food."}
{"text":"Ever wander around, trying to find the perfect place to have dinner, overwhelmed with options and unsure how to pick? Well, we trekked to Old Montreal and perused probably ten menus of all different restaurants to inform our dinner location decision. By the time we found Jardin Nelson we were hungry and getting punchy. I looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said \"oooohh, let's go here!\"   We were led to a quaint table at the back, a jazz band playing lovely music. The greenery and flowers hang all over the place and the whole atmosphere is warm and inviting.   Our server was super nice, friendly, and courteous.  I got the leek soup special. It was creamy, savory, a perfect soup. I got the veggie crepe for dinner and gobbled every bit. It was so delicious. For dessert we had the cheesecake crepe and it was heaven. You have to get this thing. Topped with graham crackers and strawberries, totally decadent.  Exquisite dining experience from top to bottom. Would return anytime and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere, delicious food! Though it is probably in a common tourist area, my husband and I came here to eat in the garden area and felt transformed into a new atmosphere. Very romantic with flowers all over and outdoor heaters (it was a little chilly that day but very comfortable there). We had beer, wine and the Brie and pesto fondue which was a little more like a dip but nonetheless still delicious, and the crepes!!!!! Sooooooo GOOD! You have to get the crepes here. Our waiter was very nice and we spent a few hours here just taking our time and enjoying our experience there. Later in the day there is a live jazz session but we weren't able to stay too late. So if you're in the area and when I am back in the area, this place is a beautiful must go to just sit back and relax!"}
{"text":"What a neighborhood gem and not a tourist trap!  The most beautiful restaurant in town with fabulous food and excellent service. Went for jazz brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Bring the camera!"}
{"text":"5stars for the patio and location. 4stars for the food. Good salad and crepes, bad pizza, staff excellent"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant seated around old Montréal. The dining area is a courtyard with canopy covers that protects for inclement weather. I can honestly say the beautiful ambiance matched the decorative food. I highly recommend to anyone visiting the Montreal area to give Jardin Nelson a visit."}
{"text":"I came here in November for my bachelorette weekend and it is a seasonal place. But I have loved coming here in the summer. Fresh food. And amazing atmosphere"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while walking around Old Montreal, and after speaking with the charming host, I decided that I HAD to eat there.  There are 2 seating areas: garden-like area in the back and a patio-area in the front (perfect for people watching in the Jacques-Cartier square area!).  Service was so friendly and prompt, and the food was delicious.  I also really appreciate how they have non-alcoholic cocktails - after a long weekend of imbibing, this was exactly what I wanted and needed!  We tried: -pate chinois au canard: a delicious shepherd's pie of duck, mashed potatoes, corn and cheese! And what a huge serving, as well. -cannelinois au four maison: 4 baked cannolis  I wish we had saved some room for the desserts and crepes, but there's always next time!  As we left, the host and owner (I'm guessing?) told us that they are only open during the late spring-early fall, so come here while you can!  3.5 stars for the food, but 5 stars for the ambiance and environment...and friendly host :) Worth coming here for the experience of sitting on their outdoor terrace and listening to the wonderful jazz music they have!"}
{"text":"Great French cuisine with excellent atmosphere and great live jazz music. The service was a bit slow but overall good!"}
{"text":"Amazing duck shepherd pie with live music! The line is not too long and the night time around 7pm is a great time to be there in Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Ordered me the croque monsieur with smoked duck. It was excellent but I'm not sure it really needed the duck. Grilled cheese on it's own is already amazing. The entree comes with a summer salad that is just as wonderful-- the fruits and dressing all go so well together with the veggies. Drank a strawberry smoothie to go with it on this warm day and it was super refreshing.   Aside from the delicious food, the restaurant is beautifully decorated (as a garden like the name suggests). Perfect for a summer day and there was live musicians play music for us on the stage. My waitress was friendly and provided superb service."}
{"text":"Wow. The birds love this wide open building. I had crepes florentine which was different with a buckwheat crepe and ham-spinach mixture. It was not light and fluffy like the crepes in the states but quite good.  We had a great drink - the chocolate maple coffee."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is the place to go if you're planning a cute date. The plants and little birds add a magical touch to the place. They also have a great jazz band that plays in the evening. The food is pretty good, especially the salmon lasagna and the lobster mac n' cheese. The staff is efficient and super friendly. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we waited in a 10-15 min line that brought us through a beautiful walkway to the restaurant. It's all open with all types of plants and these intriguing water catchers. A small, live jazz bland was playing and it set a beautiful atmosphere for us to enjoy our dinner.   Our waiter was very polite and friendly. We noticed the menu was a bit out of our price range, so we ordered the creamy goat cheese filled pastry and split a veggie pizza. Both were very tasteful and had amazing flavors. We were slightly hungry afterwards, just because the portion sizes are on the smaller side, but overall the ambience, food and service was a pleasure."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here after walking by an open window and hearing a jazz band playing in a garden. We waited in a short line and were quickly escorted into the garden section (you could choose the balcony facing the square as well, but in my opinion the garden is nicer and quieter). The live jazz band played almost the whole afternoon. We ordered a pizza to share and it was delicious! I think they are known for their crepe dishes, so we ordered one for dessert.. Also amazing. The reason one should go here as opposed to anywhere else? The beautiful garden views, the look of envious passerbys, the music, the great service and the casual, relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Pros: Great atmosphere, Live Jazz Band  Cons: ??  -Ambiance- Live jazz band + beautifully lit garden + drinks&food, what more can you ask for. Its the perfect setting for a romantic evening out with friends or even a date. Also known as a tourist hotspot, it is worth the wait for just a relax wind-down after a day in the Old Port. Service is friendly but wait time can get long.   -Drinks-  We only stopped at night (10pm) for drinks and I recommend others to do so. The air was cool, it was less busy/loud and the live band was still playing. Ordered a pitcher of blue of sangria which was a fun drink and was well worth the price of loitering there.   -Overall- Come and pay money just to be there! Food is probably subpar but who cares."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Food was ok but prices + service = not again for my family and I.  The funniest thing is that we spent a ton (hungry) and didn't get any love from the server.  Made us think...."}
{"text":"The fabulous reviews on Yelp lead me to believe that the 45min wait for a patio seat (it would have been over an hour for a garden seat) would be worth the food and ambience. Boy was that wrong! It all started with the stale bread served at the table. It's a crepe place right? Their crepes should be good? I had the rabbit saddle crepe and it came out dry dry dry. Dousing it in cheese did not help either the crepe itself or the stringy meat inside. The crepe was also too thick and too sweet. My friends had the bland oven baked salmon lasagna and the steak tartar which was oddly paired with stale and cold fries. Take a pass on this place. Montreal has too many great places to eat to waste calories in this."}
{"text":"The. Best. Restaurant.  My family came here I  the first day we came to Montreal; we were drawn by the live jazz.  We came here very early - around 5-5:30, and we got seated fairly quickly.  However, the lines do get very long, so make sure to come early!!! Their duck over salad was perfect. The decor and natural lighting setting was perfect. The live jazz was perfect.  We tried other restaurants the next day, but nothing topped this restaurant, so we came back here on our last day.  I tried both the baby ribs and the duck over salad.. highly recommend !!! Also,  the rosè and peaches sangria was great.  My favorite restaurant in montreal :) . HIGHLY recommend!!! Make sure to come early!"}
{"text":"We came to Jardin Nelson a Saturday afternoon, we were a party of 8. It started out rocky, when they found we were 8 they didn't know what too do because they had a table for 10 but did not want to give it to us. Anyways, after a 15 minute wait they finally prepare a table for us. They brought us bread (cold) then took our order for drinks. The waitress made a mistake with one of the orders but quickly fixed it. We all ordered different entrees and everyone was happy with there dish. The ambiance is beautiful, surrounded with flowers and a nice band with live music. Overall a pleasant experience. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We`ve been here a few times over the years.  The food is average.  Service is slow and they don`t really go out of their way for you.  My friend can`t eat gluten, but they said they were unable to modify any of the dishes to accommodate him (even something as simple as leaving out some cheese was too much to ask).  Probably won`t bother coming here again.  There are plenty of great restaurants in Montreal, but this isn`t one of them."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend and the food is neither good nor cheap. Ordered a thin crust pizza that would serve maybe one hungry adult for around $20. What you end up paying for isn't the food but rather the live jazz band that plays all night on an elevated stage in the dining room. They hit all the classics but my favorite was the Sinatra numbers. Overall still a good experience. If you're more in the mood for entertainment rather than fine cuisine, Jardin Nelson is a fine choice, but stay away if you're in the mood for delicious Italian."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The atmosphere was unbeatable- an outdoor patio with heat lamps and nice coverings. Our waitress was so incredibly friendly and welcoming. She gave us great advice on things to do around the area and was very attentive. The ribs were amazing and my pizza was great. We also got wine that we are definitely going to get again. It was the perfect meal with live jazz music playing the whole time."}
{"text":"If you are strolling down Rue Jacques Cartier you might overlook Jardín Nelson. Don't get distracted by lesser options. Look for the simple greenish awning with the name \"Jardin Nelson\". You can chose the patio but I recommend you dine in the garden. Excellent atmosphere with flowers, aromas and music. The jazz trio were fantastique.  JN specializes in crepes. These are so perfect. Soft yet not soggy. They hold together without being tough and chewy. I had the veal and vegetables. Ita brilliant.  If you want dessert get the Poudin Chomeur (Poor Man's Pudding). It's very much a traditional dessert of old Quebec.  Our server was wonderful. Everyone here was top notch"}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner while on vacation in Montreal for July 4th; it was recommended by friends. The live jazz music is amazing! The food and service was also very good - the Crepes Nelson (not sure if I have the name down right) are a must-try. The downside was waiting in line for about a half-hour before being seated (this was around 10 or later at night), but the wait was definitely worth it! The warmth and ambience of the place makes for a great atmosphere. The location is perfect - take a stroll along the docks and through the old town, then settle down for dinner at this very cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't live in Montreal anymore, and oh how I miss this place!  The location, the vibe, the ridiculously amazing patio, the live jazz, the delicious food....errrthang is just wow. This place is a real gem!  I dream about their baked cheese flaky pastry and their poudding chomeur! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I was under the weather when I came here, but I could still taste the food.  I think it was decent. . . crepes?  More importantly, the back patio was welcoming and they served me cups and cups of hot tea with honey.  The staff was excellent and for being in my state, I really enjoyed the experience and the outdoor area.  The jazz musicians weren't half bad either. . ."}
{"text":"Ok.... so it is the most touristy part of town.... they don't take reservations and there is always a line. With that said.... GO!  Even as a Montrealer I love this place. Very good food, great service and fabulous ambience. The restaurant has no roof with tons of flowers and plants all over the place."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! This area is super crowded with places trying to get your patronage but using Yelp saved us from wasting our money and time. We visited here three times in our ten-day visit; it's that good.  Twice we ate at the end of the outdoor seating nearest the river, and the romantic ambiance was wonderful. Fresh flowers, a cool breeze, a great view all prepared us for a delicious meal.  Plenty of healthy choices as well as French classics. The staff was seriously helpful and attentive even though they were super busy. The only negative was one evening we ordered a couple of cocktails and I am positive they skipped the alcohol! No biggie. We were having a good time. We ate once in the courtyard where there was a live jazz quartet playing classics. Very fun atmosphere, and a seriously good time. If you are in Old Town, this is a gem you shouldn't pass up."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent ambiance. We had live jazz playing and we all got the Julius Caesar salad, which was amazing! Also got some fruity drinks. Really loved the service.  A nice fancy spot surrounded by beautiful plants right off the water in old Montreal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We waited in line for the front terrace not knowing there was another line for the almost empty back terrace. Blame our stupidity or the service that seemed a bit lost.   Didn't have food this time but the garden in the back is pretty sweet, I wouldn't call it amazing but surely relaxing.   The frozen piña colada was actually one of the best I had so five star for it.   Other than that it's an ok until I try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I must say what a garden this is !! One thing that stood out is how this restaurants decor is as if you are walking into a total garden which has absolutely no ceilings.. All open space so when you look up you can see the skye!! The atmosphere is very exotic garden feel.. I came here with a special someone and we got a table very quickly. There was A LOT OF PEOPLE! It was packed!!! The service was poor.. We only ordered like 30 minutes when the waiter finally came to take down our order.  The food definitely compensated for the poor service. I loved everything except the tuna ceviche. I found it super acidic and it was not a good balance. The fish tasted very bland.  Omg i recommend the 2 different fish tartar woow that was delicious and the meat board was so good with the caramelized onions!! The shrimps were amazingggg they cleaned it up for us and had all the shells removed even the tail shells very impressed!  I also ADORED THEIR PIÑA COLADA !!!   Overall, service is not great but the food definitely compensated and would come back in a heartbeat!!! Definitely recommend this cool place 100% !!! yummmmmyy"}
{"text":"The food was good... but the atmosphere is what I loved about this place.  Really lovely and the jazz was great!  We were there on a very busy weekend night and the line at the door moved quickly.  Service was outstanding.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Really great ambiance with the jazz signer, the flowers and the little birds. I was expecting a little more out of the food but pleasantly surprised with the prices. The menu there isn't as expensive as you'd expect it to be for a high in demand restaurant in The Old Port of Montreal."}
{"text":"The food is good and decent price. But, you can't make a reservation and if you're meeting a group there they will make you wait for almost the entire group to arrive before giving you a table, even if half the place is empty."}
{"text":"Many rain refuge were sought today, but Jardin Nelson was most comforting.  We darted down the alley way entrance to courtyard, which under normal circumstances would have been a shady oasis.  Today, noooope.  The torrent of rain found every nook & cranny in their impressive over head canopy system.  There were however plenty of dry tables to be had and a local lunch special were on our minds.  We were seated inside in the second level.  Nice table with good views of Place Jacques-Cariter.  Of course, the local brew had to be sampled first.  Nice selection of bottled locals and imports, but my eyes were drawn to the Boreale Blonde and Rousse.  Both very nice blends from Quebec.  Lunch...well when in Rome, eat like a Roman, in this case, when in Montreal eat like a local.  Crepes galore!  Tough decision, but the Aiguillettes de canard confines, Duck breast \"Aiguillettes,\" cheddar, mozzarella, cranberries and orange sauce folded into a savory crepe.  Oh my, simply fabulous."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Montreal and we came here after exploring the beautiful area for lunch! The ambiance was spectacular with live jazz music playing. Our server was friendly and sweet and told me about the vegetarian options. Food was incredibly delicious with great presentation! Overall, it was the perfect lunch that complemented our day perfectly! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Recommend this place, great food and service. Especially service! our server  You can be seated in several different areas- we chose to sit in an open air patio out front so we could people watch. Perfect day outside.  My wife had a dessert crepe with apples and I had a pizza with lots of meats. Both were very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a lovely brunch/lunch this week and can't say enough good things about our experience here. We sat in the courtyard and our waitress Pascale was fun, spunky and knowledgable. She helped us enjoy our stay and made us feel relaxed. We enjoyed the rosé sangria. It's a must. Most people ordered the melon sangria. We tried it as one of our neighboring tables was generous to share a sample. It was overly sweet and screamed hangover central. The rosé sangria was just perfect. The right amount of sweet and boozy. We also tried the port one too. It was not sweet at all even though it was a port wine. We drank the second pitcher from this choice.   As an appetizer we enjoyed the Quebec cheeses: delicious. For main courses I had the duck with salad. It was so delectable. For dessert we shared a cheesecake crepe that was unreal.   The jazz band was lively and a great added bonus. The atmosphere is very chill with birds chirping and beautiful flowers.  We were told not to bother going but I'm so glad we didn't listen. We will return and recommend others to enjoy it. We loved it so much we spoke to the manager and told her how much we enjoyed our visit. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Started off with blue Curaçao sangria which my wife really liked but i thought was too sweet.    Bread rolls were average at best.   Bruschetta was really excellent almost tastes like a brioche.   I had the spinach salad was was excellent, lots of fresh strawberries and a sweet maple dressing  I had the salmon pizza which was good not excellent. Didn't love the crust. Salmon lasagna with bechemel sauce was excellent the best dish out we had.   Service was ok, could have been more attentive.   All this being said, it was a wonderful evening, as the patio here is outrageous.  It turned an average meal into an excellent meal, with the beautiful scenery, and the amazing weather we were blessed with. Definitely come for a nice evening on a beautiful day"}
{"text":"Three and a half for food, four for atmosphere.  I enjoyed sipping mimosa and listening to the jazz band rock out on jazz standards and Elvis.  The atmosphere and décor feels like you're walking into Paris.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth the cost.  We were very spoiled for spectacular food in Montreal.  But it's a beautiful spot and I would certainly come again."}
{"text":"Food and service were OK.   Good location and beautiful interior garden.  If you are looking for a patio and casual food this should work great."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday evening with a huge group of 12 gentlemen, perfectly expecting to be turned away given the obvious wait time. (You can't make reservations - it's first come, first serve.) Well, we weren't. The host on staff went out of his way to check the dining area to see whether their large group of 8 was almost finished.   Lucky us, they were! What proceeded was an incredible dinner with a variety of drinks and entrees. I had eaten here before with my wife, so I knew what to expect foodwise - but I was overwhelmed by how easily they accommodated our group and got every single thing right. Bravo."}
{"text":"Was looking for something different as we walked on Jacques Cartier.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I had the pork crepes & my dining companion had a seafood one.  Both were delicious - we gobbled every bite down.  Was the perfect way to finish the afternoon, sitting here with a beer & crepes.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the ambiance! If you want a nice place to sit down and enjoy a local meal as a tourist, this is well worth your time and money. There is a beautiful open air courtyard with live music and multiple levels of dining. We stopped by here on a weekday afternoon for lunch before leavin . The staff was extremely professional and helpful to us out-of-towners. You really should order a crepe if you are looking to get the most out of this restaurant. Although I saw others order other items, this place is notorious for crepes. I ordered the Filet de Porc and it was really tasty! Plenty of pork, so many fresh ingredients. These crepes are very very large by the way. My bf ordered the Rable de lapin (rabbit) which was also full of many ingredients and super flavorful. The slaw that came with the crepes was amazing too! I ordered a drink as well and it was very well made. Great quality, large quantities and I feel that the prices are fair for what you get. It gets crowded so be sure to go during quiet hours. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line to be seated."}
{"text":"Situé dans la place Jacques Quartier, en plein cur de la zone ultra touristique, ce restaurant avec un jardin magnifique en vaut le détour. Je vais régulièrement là en été, c'est la meilleure période afin de profiter du décor super agréable et de la terrasse couverte. Le service est rapide et attentionné. Ne soyez pas effrayé par la ligne d'attente en été, cela passe rapidement et l'établissement possède quand même assez de places. Évidemment, vous pouvez toujours vous installer à l'intérieur, mais c'est la terrasse qui en vaut la peine, surtout qu'en été il y a un groupe qui joue du jazz. Le Jardin Nelson est réputé pour ses choix de cocktails, particulièrement leurs sangrias. Alors à partager entre amis!! Leur pizza sont délicieuses ainsi que leurs crêpes. Il ne faut pas s'attendre à de la haute gastronomie. Toutefois, je trouve les prix un peu dispendieux, mais cela va avec le quartier."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the multi-level courtyard seating with live jazz.  Definitely come here more for the environment than the food, which was ok, but did not dazzle.  The crepes are a good bet, especially the Nelson (apple, maple syrup, bacon, cheese...)"}
{"text":"Pretty much a tourist trap given its location and it is a little overpriced. It was a great space though, being in the open air, and with substantial umbrella coverage from the sun (and potential rain). The server told us that the umbrellas catch the rain water and then they use it on their flowers and plants in the space. Pretty cool :)   My friends and I enjoyed Bloody Cesars and multiple orders of fries, which were tasty. A jazz band was playing the entire time, which added to the relaxed vibe. It's a cute place to go to but I likely wouldn't seek it out again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect! You feel like you are on the streets of Paris enjoying live jazz while people watching in their beautiful courtyard. The servicewas excellent, and the Seafood Crepe was to die for! I could've devoured mine but opted to savor it by saving half for the next day. I really wanted the Nutella crepe but we were all so full. Oh well, next time!  Can I just say that the white sangria was also amazing! So fruity and light  The staff was kind and attentive, and our waiter was so mild mannered and pleasant. I definitely want to come back here with the family! You can't beat the location, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves!"}
{"text":"Great little crepe restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal (Vieux Montreal).  Patio is perfect for people watching, and has beautiful flowers, music, and overall ambiance.  The food is great, crepes are perfectly cooked, with slightly crispy edges. The Nelson especially was an awesome explosion of sweet and savory, definitely haven't had anything like that before-- so definitely worth a shot.  One minus: the restaurant suffers from what has to be a bee hive nearby... we spent most of our meal swatting them away to no relief!"}
{"text":"I really loved Jardin Nelson.  Not only is it located in one of the most historical areas in Montreal but the ambience is so quaint and romantic.  What a great date place!  I love the beautiful garden in the terrace and courtyard with the live Jazz music playing.  My sister really emphasized to me that the outdoor seating was year round with their gigantic parasols and \"water catchers\".  We frequent Jardin Nelson every time I come to Montreal to visit.    The service was friendly and quick.  My Jardin Nelson experience is always so pleasant.  Their crepes are delicious and the portions will leave you stuffed.  I've had their Râble de Lapin and the Diva.  Both delicious.  That's one of the things that I love about Montreal is you can get gamey meats almost everywhere!  I love my Lapin with its musrooms, cheese, and white sauce.  It's so creamy rich and delicious.  I recently ordered their Pâté chinois au canard which is basically their version of Shepherd's pie and with the side of beets and fruit ketchup what a perfect combination.  I'm drooling thinking about it.  There are a variety of food options including many vegetarian choices and quite a variety of beverages as well.  I think that the prices are reasonable averaging ~$15 per dish considering the service, ambience, and quality of food.  I hope to come here again the next time I visit Montreal and most definitely recommend others both visitors and locals to try Jardin Nelson."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Jardin Nelson long before my first trip to Montreal so I was very excited to be able to finally dine there. I was not disappointed.  The location in the Old Port is convenient for tourists like me and upon wing into the outdoor dining area it felt like I had discovered a secret garden. The decor is beautiful, with a few tiers of terraces, a small stage, and lots of greens and flowers.  The ambiance is wonderful and both romantic and family friendly. I was able to visit on a night with a live jazz band.  I knew they were famous for their crepes, so I ordered the duck crepe. The waitstaff was very friendly and our waitress was extremely attentive and even started a pleasant conversation about the arts with us.  The food was the highlight of my trip to Montreal, he best meal I had while I was there. The idea of duck in a crepe is not nearly as mouthwatering as the actual dish served to me. I wish this restaurant was close to home.  Mid-meal, it started pouring but the outdoor area was equipped with rain catchers that feed into their plants so we stayed dry the entire meal.  There's definitely something especially romantic about spending my birthday night dining in an enclosed garden, in Montreal, in the rain.  Half a year later and I'm still reaching about this place to everyone I know and I am looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The timings on Yelp seem incorrect. They opened at 11:30 today (Saturday). Customer service is great and the place got packed quite fast. The food was good - not exceptional. Best thing we ordered was the Pizza Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"Really rude service, was in a line waiting for 30 mins with another 30 Mins to go.  Asked for a menu and was turned down.  Food is fine not worth the service or wait."}
{"text":"This is a must go to place in Montreal. Onion soup was fantastic and big enough for two to share. The Jazz was also so good and relaxing."}
{"text":"In the heart of the adorable and toursity old town you find Jardin Nelson - a mostly outdoor cafe with delicious food, a great selection of wine and live jazz.  Really couldn't ask for better on a warm summer afternoon. We loved it so much we went back twice in one weekend.   Recommend: the Rioja the cider cheese plate French Onion Soup mushroom crepe, (the radish slaw served with the crepes is SO good!).  The fish gravlax was a little bland but the salad with it was great.  The chicken liver pate was good but the onion confit was far too sweet.  Prices are on the high side but you are also paying for a lovely and relaxed atmosphere - consider it a tip for the ever present live jazz.    Service excellent and I have to give props to our server who ever so deftly suggested that there was wine by the glass after 3 of us polished off our second bottle.  A classy way to cut us off.  I wonder if the fact that my friend was posing with the ramekins over her eyes was a hint that we'd had too much?"}
{"text":"You are planning to treat yourself, you must visit this place. It is a beautiful, lively restaurant near old port. The ambience is summery with lots of greens and flowers around. They have a majestic terrace. And the cocktails are amazing. And the margaritas were fabulous. The frozen Pina colada is a must try. A bit on the expensive side for me, but I was in a party mood that day :) They have a very good variety starters and main meal courses as well. The service is good.  And to top it all, there is live jazz music to set your mood to \"happy\" ;)"}
{"text":"You can't beat the ambience here. I specifically avoided dessert at the restaurant I ate dinner at, so that I could spend some time here in the short weekend I had in Montreal. (The dinner menu looked good but we had made reservations elsewhere already). We ordered the pouding chomeur, which is basically a maple syrup bread pudding. It was way too sweet, but I think that is the nature of the dessert itself and nothing bad by the restaurant.  I felt bad that we didn't order anything else (I was sugared out with that pouding) but since it was close to closing time, the server didn't give us the stink-eye.   The live jazz music, the outdoor floral and fauna that gave the garden effect, the lighting ....it was the perfect ending to the night. Of my snapchats from all over Montreal, Jardin Nelson received the chat back of, \"What is your life??\". Sitting in the courtyard, I couldn't help but think, what is this life, indeed."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place to grab some food in a delightful setting.  We went for dessert and each got a crepe. They were good - not great. The savory crepes sounded delicious, I want to go back and try them.  The jazz music was beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat in the touristy area of Old Port/Old Montréal.   After attending a terrific performance at Cirque du Soleil we were hungry for a late dinner and some cocktails. After walking around the area looking for a place we peeked into the back courtyard of Jardin Nelson and immediately knew we found our spot.  The back courtyard at night is all lit up wonderfully with large umbrellas overhead, flowered plants and trees, along with a band and amazing singer crooning old standards. The setting is magical and we loved it. In fact, we went back on another night during our vacation to Montreal to enjoy it again. We ended up with the same waitress both times and she was just outstanding, and she remembered us too.  Great service, fresh tasty food, good drinks, romantic ambiance, live music in the back courtyard - we loved it all. Highly recommended over many other spots to eat at in the area, and I feel it's even better to come here without children at night if looking for a more romantic and adult kind of dining experience.  Just a terrific spot to sit outside and dine at when the weather is nice while being serenaded with the cool sounds of Sinatra, jazz greats, and other sweet sounds."}
{"text":"Perfect location in the Old Port with all-day live music. We were seated in the garden. The food was reasonably priced, I ordered the duck confit crepe which was a bit dry. 4/5 for food, 5/5 for the experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Jardin nelson many times over the years and I can't say I've ever been disappointed. This is a nice place to go to when it's nice out and to sit in their outside back patio/jazz garden. I've always had great service and tasty food here. They have some nice cocktails and desserts as well. The ambience alone is so nice and relaxing and makes you feel like you're on vacation and on weekends when they have the live music it's even better (the music isn't overly loud to disrupt your dinner convo. I've tried their pizza , their salmon lasagna and their duck croque Monsieur and each of them was good so for me I feel like you can't go wrong with really with any item on their menu -at least in my experience to date. Their cocktails are good too they pack enough punch for your dollar and the flavours and variety are there as well. Very nice place to visit when you're in the old port and very nice choice for a date restaurant. The prices are reasonable given the location and quality of food ambience and service , not overly cheap but not crazy pricey either. Just be prepared to wait in line during peak hours and seasons as they don't take reservations last I asked but there's lots of seating so I've never waiting a crazy amount of time for a table. But definitely with waiting to get a table in the back patio instead of inside or the front patio as it makes for a whole different experience."}
{"text":"We strolled in at 3:30pm for a very late lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and drinks here. The port sangria had a lot of orange flavor and was very refreshing. The seafood crepe had a nice cooking wine flavor to it. The ingredients were very fresh. We also had a pizza with mostly sausages and salamis. The crust was very thin and crisp. I should add that the venue was very nice. A spacious outdoor seating area with live music - even for the late afternoon"}
{"text":"In summer it's a great place if you're looking for a terrasse.  They also have live jazz music which adds a nice touch.  The pizzas aren't that great but the crepes and salads are usually a decent bet."}
{"text":"So glad that we walked past Jardin Nelson and heard the music coming from the patio area! I knew immediately that we had to go there. There was live jazz playing which was super nice and gave the place a nice vibe. They even had speakers from the live performance hooked to the bathrooms so you can still hear the music.   The patio area is outdoors but completely covered with these ginormous umbrellas. I loved it! They had flowers and plants everywhere and it was just such a nice spot to be to eat and relax.   For food, I would 150% recommend the duck leg confit and salad! It was sooo flavorful and tender. We also got the beef tartare which was good but definitely not as memorable as the duck leg.   We also got the poor man's pudding for dessert and it was a great way to end our meal. It kind of tasted like bread pudding but with a cornbread-y texture. It was warm and served with vanilla ice cream. Such a treat!   I'll definitely be back here to listen to the jazz and eat the amazing duck the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ce que je retiendrai surtout de Jardin Nelson, c'est sa belle grande terrasse intérieure où s'accumulent par beau temps plein de petites tables, mais aussi un groupe de jazz qui égaye encore plus l'ambiance. Quand nous avons testé cet endroit, il faisait près de 30°C et un grand soleil, ce qui aide à apprécier. Même s'il y avait du monde, nous avons trouvé une table assez rapidement.  Au choix on peut y manger grâce à un large choix de salades, crêpes et pizzas, mais surtout boire un verre. Nous avons opté pour un pichet (6 dollars canadiens) de limonade à la Nelson, \"agrémentée d'une infusion de menthe, coriandre, basilic et thé vert avec jus de lime frais et un soupçon de miel\". Ni trop sucrée, ni trop acide, c'est parfait.  Niveau service et ambiance, on retrouve avec plaisir la bonne humeur des Québecois !"}
{"text":"Our favorite in old Montreal. Nice atmosphere. Great food. And the sangria is a must. We always go here. It is the total package  there is often live jazz playing as well. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, mais nourriture décevante! Je suis allée à ce resto pour le souper une belle journée d'été. Bien entendu, la terrasse est magnifique. Décor enchanteur avec plein de fleurs dans la cour intérieur! Toutefois, la nourriture nous a déçus. Les pizzas n'étaient pas goûteuses et le prix était plutôt élevé. J'aimerais y retourner pour le brunch l'été, je suis certaine que je pourrais avoir une belle surprise. En attendant que je vous en reparle, n'ayez pas trop d'attente au niveau de la bouffe! Et soyez prêts à faire une LONGUE file d'attente!"}
{"text":"Completely touristy and overhyped! Pass!!!  They do have a lovely patio but it all goes downhill from there. Food is overpriced and underwhelming.  They have a large selection of savoury crepes ranging from $15-$20. Crepes came out looking more like a calzone, I think they were made in some kind of machine that presses them in half. What the CREPE????  Server was friendly but was in the back folding napkins, ignoring us as we waited impatiently for water, dying in the 30 degree heat.  Not for locals. Stay away."}
{"text":"Ever just want to hear soothing music after a long day's work or just arriving in Montreal and you want to know where you can eat at the same time? Go down to the Old Port...Nestled in the heart of it you can eat at an outside terrace between four buildings. Nice decor garden like. The Good: they play live jazz 7 days a week. There's plenty of choices with their speciality crepes. We got La Forestière crêpe which is garlic, white wine, mushroom with asparagus and salmon on a bed of spinach rice vermicelli. Overall affordable.The Bad. Well you're at a garden so a lot of healthy choices. There are choices for those who may want to eat something like pasta or steak but- this ain't it. The Ugly: during supper hours lineups:( which can take at least 20-30 minutes. But if you don't mind waiting then it's worth it. Tip: don't do what we did and try to enter at St Paul ( because we saw the live jazz more from this side) go to St Jacques..this adds to your waiting time to get in. On a nice summer day get dessert elsewhere and coffee better choices outside. Stroll along the port and maybe take a ride on Montreal's ferris wheel, largest in Canada. Cost wise $$"}
{"text":"Even if you're not hungry, GO without a moment's hesitation to this restaurant. It is a gorgeous marriage of indoor and outdoor dining. There is a phenomenal jazz quartet riffing on recognizable tunes ( in an accessible and fun way ). There are modern lighting installations warming the facades of the centuries old buildings which define the dining area. It's a visually stunning place.   We went with seven people and everyone was happy with their meals. Four of us are vegetarian, and the menu served us nicely. I had the roasted beet salad which was terrific! Fresh, crunchy, and with beets, pine nuts, cranberries, wide planks of very good parmesan, and raspberries all atop a bed of fresh greens. There was another salad at the table that looked even more pretty than mine did (which is saying something) as well as some crepes, a duck shepherd's pie, and white wine sangria that everyone raved about.   With an atmosphere that enhances your Old Montreal experience, and food that pleases a wide palate range - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Get a table in the patio!!Come before the sunset and watch the restaurant transition from a beautiful enclosed intimate garden to jazz night with a live band!  The prices are fair for old montreal the music and the experience! I like the pizza, the lobster salad ...but really it is all about the atmosphere and music here!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice outside if you are lookig for a shaded break near the sidewalk. Service was very good and helpful, and pretty fast. Although the food was a bit on the expensive side, the food and drinks were very good. I recommend the iced mango drink. Our waiter had very good english!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once in 2013 and recently in 2017! Both times were great, however, this restaurant earns more praise for its atmosphere than its food. There's a live jazz band most days, beautiful outdoor seating, wondrous views, and fantastic service.   The food is not memorable or legendary but it gets the job done. I ordered a baked duck dish, which I didn't think would be much like a Shephard's Pie but it was? Last time I ordered a salmon pizza that I didn't care much for. Appetizers here, for some reason, are really good. I ordered the brie fondue and the calamari and both were so tasty. Much more memorable than my main dish.   Anyway, most of my friends ordered a crepe, and while I never had any of Jardin Nelson's crepes, I just think they look so weird. If you're American, you'll think: \"Whoa, that crepe looks like a quesadilla.\""}
{"text":"It was there...we were there so we went in. The nachos were one of the best I've had in a while but the crepe(the one named after the place with bacon, cheese, apples and maple in it) was a bit on the sweet side. Yummy but sweet.   Keeping in mind I wont drink alcohol if its more strong than sweet, I could down the Tokyo Ice Teas they had all night. Their blue sangria tasted like floor cleaner though."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was exceptional. Live music was beautiful. The was a long line to her in but overall good. The only downfall is the menu, I was expecting more options."}
{"text":"Great place! Very nice ambience with the live jazz music. The sangria is excellent! Tried the poke and was very unique!"}
{"text":"This place is smack dab in the middle of Old Montreal but it didn't feel like a tourist spot.  We had two different savory crepes that were both pretty damn good.  They resembled quesadillas with a french twist.  We sat outside in the front which had great ambiance and was good for people watching.  The sun and the heaters kept us warm on a chilly October afternoon.  The waitress was attentive and you could tell they were interested in more than just turning tables of tourists."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is a very popular destination, especially on weekends. They have a garden in the back and a lovely flowery terrace next to Jacques-Cartier Square. The food is served quite quickly and the portions are pretty good for the price. I tried the curry chicken crêpe and it was not as spicy as I thought, whereas my friend took the beef tartar and it was quite good!"}
{"text":"Beautiful stop and quick service. Lovely atmosphere and friendly service. We had the mac and cheese with lobster, florentine crepe, rabbit crepe, and pouding chomeur. All perfect. The lemonade was also awesome. Would definitely return. Simply lovely."}
{"text":"Jardin Nelson is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal. We stopped in on a very hot, very busy holiday weekend during the Montreal Jazz Festival. My advice--don't be impatient and sit inside or in the front. Wait in line (it moves fast) for a table on the back terrace, where mammoth hanging planters filled with gorgeous blooms filter the sunlight and offer respite from the heat. The service is fast, friendly, and efficient; the staff definitely knows how to manage a busy scene. And the jazz combo playing softly in the background is a nice touch.  The main menu section features more than a dozen different crepes. I had the Jardin, which is a corn and sesame crepe filled with fresh, seasonal veggies, olives, and goat cheese. Delicious! My husband opted for the French Dip, which was heaped with savory roast beef sandwiched between amazing French bread--crusty on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. The dipping sauce and horseradish sides added great flavor, and the frites were pretty darn good too!  Because we had an hour's drive ahead of us, we couldn't try any of the drink specials, but the pitchers of house-made Sangria passing us every few minutes looked like the ideal remedy for the hot summer weather."}
{"text":"This was probably the best overall meal I had in Old Town Montreal. I went for brunch and ordered the Open-faced Grilled Cheese served with a summer salad and it was BANGING. So much flavor in the grilled cheese with cheddar, blue cheese, dates and drizzled maple syrup. My girlfriend got a crepe and loved it. They have a full bar and we got some bloody mary's which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a more upscale restaurant within Old Montreal. The atmosphere is very inviting; city out on the patio allows customers to enjoy the buildings and square. The food was very good with good flavors. Three of us had varying crepes and all were quite delicious. There is no kids menu, but they do accommodate with three different pasta options. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible service, just terrible. Before our drinks even came there was a bird pooping onto our table but the staff couldn't care less (perhaps because we're an \"ethnic\" family). Both the wait staff, and someone, who I assume is the manager, were extremely rude and very unapologetic. Sure, they couldn't do anything about the bird, but they could have, at the very least, let us move the table slightly, to avoid unwanted filth falling directly into our food and drinks. After a long while of this absurdity, the staff (very reluctantly), moved us to another table (inside this time). By this point though, this place had completely ruined our mood, both by the staff's deliberate avoidance of our issues, and their continued insolence. As a party of 7, we ordered a variety of dishes. Again, the food was not only subpar, but actually unenjoyable. In fact, we all concluded that we had had substantially better food elsewhere. Overall, not going back. Somehow, their blatant ignorance of our concerns during the service, and the unapologetic 'gtfo' attitude towards us (and to no other patrons present there at the time) is quite evident of a very bigotedly racist attitude embodied in this rather unremarkable eatery. As a paying customer, it's disappointing to be treated as a 'lesser person' in this day and age."}
{"text":"Great find nestled in the heart of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is awesome. We were able to sit outside in the garden and listen to the jazz band above us playing. The wait staff speaks English and is helpful with ordering.  To drink we had a pitcher of sangria and split the nachos appetizer. They were both okay, but nothing I would go back for. The atmosphere made for a great time."}
{"text":"On a super hot day, my husband and I were looking for a nice place to stop in a have a cold drink.  After my husband saw the live duo play (a stand-up bass player and a keyboardist), he wanted in.  This is really a nice place to sit and absorb all the loveliness of the garden around you, and the music, too.    We were seated and the waiter didn't seem to have a problem with us ordering drinks and Jardin Nelson had a long list of drinks, which we happy to see.  My husband had a beer and I had a $10 mojito which really hit the spot.  Kind of expensive, but this is a very touristy area in Old Montreal.    If I'm ever back, I'd like to come back for crepes or some other French food.  This would be a nice place to be at any time of the day."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe the food here... It was FANTASTIC. Went here on my 30th birthday in April, and I could not of had a better dinner anywhere. I wanted to savor each and every bite it was so delicious. Our whole group felt the same way and we each had something different. My meal was the salmon lasagna, you won't regret trying this! Also, the atmosphere was amazing. There a front outside area, theres an inside, and theres this garden area out back which is huge. we sat in the garden area in the back..it was so beautiful. It was heated so we were not chilly, and it was lively. There was a great jazz band on a stage..and different levels of tables all surrounding this stage. It was wonderful. Prices and service was great also."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent live music. The restaurant decor is absolutely gorgeous - it's easy to imagine that you are in France. I shared the Diva crepe and the Pizza du Marche. The pizza was tasty and filling - loved the rich flavors of the veggies. I enjoyed the crepe as well.   Most dishes are around $15-17 so it's definitely a splurge if you are on a budget, but so worth it. The restaurant is right in the heart of Old Montreal, which is a very charming area. Too bad our time was cut short due to a storm warning. We got quite a scare with a heavy downpour. Oof! Come for the food, but leave before the storm!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here recently. Even though it was a bit cool the heat lamps made the open air restaurant warm. The music wasn't imposing just gave the place a nice atmosphere and the food was quite good. I wouldn't describe it as particularly exciting but reliable. And the dessert I had was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Came here for anniversary brunch. Seeing as we were in Montreal, i figured I'd look for some crepes! Hands down the best crepe I've eaten. I got the classic Nelson crepe. Bacon was extra crispy, Maple syrup was very tasty. And my cocktail was superb. Atmosphere was very enchanting, beautiful garden and live music. Only problem was the bees flying around. Would come here again for sure. Great value great prices."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd love such a tourist place, but Jardin Nelson did a good job of kicking that idea out of my head.   First, we came on a GORGEOUS Saturday afternoon in Montreal. Of course, the city is filled with tourists during the summer which leave places like this to be packed. We were given an option to wait for a table out front (which we were the first in line) or proceed to the back line which is for the garden area out back. The line was much longer, but once we saw how fast it was moving, we moved over to the back line. We were seated within 5 minutes. The line was SUPER long, but larger parties were in front of us and they were able to seat 2 people quicker than a party of 6.   We were seated RIGHT next to the live band. Perfect music for a gorgeous weekend afternoon. The menu is quite large, which is kind of a turn-off for me (more options means more time til the food gets in my belly!) They've got a few options for sangria - we opted for the peach one (a must try!!). Started with the bruchetta - tomato party ova here! More tomatoes than I knew what to do with (to my delight). Then we ordered a veggie pizza, which normally, I think 3+ ingredients on a pizza is a little too much, but NOT on this one. It was a great suggestion by our server, who was polite and friendly.   This place is BUSY. It's FILLED. They are great at turning over the tables. We were seated right when many others tables were, so I fear that it'd take a long time for our food to come out. NOPE! Our food came out not even 10 minutes after ordering. It actually arrived faster than I had thought. I'm very impressed at how this place functions at such a fast pace, considering I used to work at a Cheesecake Factory and this was never the case during the busy period.   Not to mention the proximity to the water is prime. Not even a 5 minute walk if I remember correctly.   I'd love to come back here on my next visit to this pretty city."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I went online ready for have a great dinner and a great environment! But I made a mistake!! I was by myself one for dinner! They let me wait forever! How do they know I won't be like five people? Have to be a long wait I finally sit down as for a cup of water it's another five minutes! Maybe Labor Day long weekend! Or just best service as usual in old town  Montreal! Anyway I will stop leave those negative comment now started to enjoy my wonderful dinner   I hope"}
{"text":"Very cozy, yet spacious garden patio tucked off the busy through fare of Jacques Cartier, the menu is heavy on delicious-looking crepes and other delights.  There is a very limited kids menu, standard options like cheese pizza and mac and cheese, which actually were adult quality.  We chose bruschetta for a starter to share and the toast was crispy with just a hint of garlic, and the bruschetta topping came in a separate bowl allowing you to put as much or as little as you like. It tasted fresh and was quite good.  The mains were, for me, a duck confit salad, bursting with flavour from the glaze and juicy duck meat. The poppy dressing could have been from a jar but the salad was very good nonetheless. My wife had an apple crepe which she said was passable.  Our first round of fountain Cokes tasted off and I asked for a beer instead. They kindly removed the soft drinks from the bill.  Overall we were very pleased with the food and the service, the ambience is also very suitable for families, romantic dinners, or father's day lunches."}
{"text":"Great little spot in old montreal. Had a great time with friends and then food and drinks were on spot.  Service was fast friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Yesterday night we went there and we had such a great time.  The beginning we had to wait good 30 min. Actually it was the worse part of the night but after everything went good.  We tried white and red wine, they were really nice. We were eating French Onion Soup, Cannelloni, Ribs, Shepherds pie...  Everything was awesome! I just simply loved the environment, the flowers, the music. Highly recommend summer time the garden.  Absolutely 5*"}
{"text":"Great fresh place to spend a Sunday brunch for a friend's birthday. The terrace is beautifully designed with a open ceiling. You can see and hear the birds chirping and a live jazz band playing in the background. The brunch was good, I had the option of an Eco friendly fresh salmon salad, it was refreshing to eat, with a delicate taste of coriander.   Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"I used to go here quite often in days past but has been at least 10 years since I last came. The place was packed and waiter looked a little lost but did try his best. Better word would be over whelmed. He screwed up at least 4 times on our order from wrong beers, no forks etc...I ordered Crepe curry chicken. This was not good at all. First it was suppose to be spicy!!! lol...a baby can handle this as there was no spice. Then I kept waiting for the curry and waiting and waiting....No curry taste but at the end in the middle. 1 star  for the food 5 star for the ambiance. Would I go back. Yes but only to bring someone for the ambiance and a beer. Cannot go wrong with beer unless they keep screwing up."}
{"text":"Love love love the ambience of the place, it's like a half outdoor half indoor patio restaurant, with a live jazz band! I think that probably did it the most for me, it was like i was being serenaded whilst shoving my face, hence making me feel classier :)   The waiter we had was really nice, super attentive, came to check on us the right amount of time, always made sure we had enough water and drinks.   The food was pretty good too, you have to try the rosemary wings! it might sound plain which i mean yeah it is, but it's so good!! simple yet tasteful. Some ordered savory crepes, others ordered pizza.  The food was pretty filling so worth the price in my opinion.   I'm glad to have come check this place out, we came on a Friday night around 9:30 and got seated right away.  We were in the area the next day and there was an insane line to get to eat here! guess we chose the right place. :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  Food was decent. I suggest the French Onion Soup, best thing we had. The red sangria was decent... a little sweet, but decent. Rest of food was pretty good but not life-changing.  Service was slow... very slow. It took us 2 hours to get through a simple lunch.  Also, they didn't take AMEX.  This is a pet peeve for me at this point. If you're a business who doesn't allow customers to pay with whatever their preferred form of payment is, I'm not coming back to give you my business...  who the heck doesn't take AMEX in a high tourist area these days???"}
{"text":"Don't like this place. Mediocre food. Somewhat overpriced. A classic tourist trap. Could maybe even serve as a textbook definition of the latter (their are many places like this in the high traffic center of the Old Port - I generally avoid this and pick Old Port restos at the periphery - e.g., Barroco or Bocata)."}
{"text":"There are many verandas along the Place Jacques-Cartier that one can sit under and enjoy a meal and a cocktail, but in addition to the traditional square-side patio, the Jardin Nelson has an interior open air courtyard with modern canopies (space heaters as well for the cooler months).   The atmosphere is unique and lively. There was a two piece ensemble playing light jazz & standards during our very nice lunch. There is a full service bar and they specialize in a variety of Sangrias offered by the half-pitcher and larger!  The fare was all good, although nothing exceptional. The setting and the Sangria is the draw here."}
{"text":"Great quaint bistro in the hub of Montreal  We enjoyed an late evening latte with desert crepes  Strawberry and banana with chocolate sauce inside and out, most enjoyable."}
{"text":"A mix of families, dates, casual, and nicely dressed people.  Good food, priced a bit high, but to be expected in an area like this.   But mostly its about the ambiance.  A live, light-jazz band playing amid the balconies, flowering plants, multiple levels, and open-air environment."}
{"text":"Definitely a good experience here! The dirty martini could've been a little bit dirtier but the crepes are excellent. We sat outside just people watching. Having drinks. Ambiance was on point with the live jazz playing in the back courtyard. It's pretty intimate there. Enjoy when you're here. Get the Nelson!"}
{"text":"The one restaurant a friend recommended we go to in Montreal was Jardin Nelson simply for their French onion soup. This place is in Old Montreal and the inside doesn't let you forget that with the stone walls. It's cool!  All we ordered was the French onion soup and it was amazing! One bowl was enough for each of us and we slowly ate it to savor every bite. It also helped that it was pouring down rain so soup was the perfect lunch!  Definitely stop here to try heir French onion soup if you're visiting Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Too slow.  Food is not the best.  More of a tourist attraction (garden) than a place for good food.    Service was very slow."}
{"text":"Very very very cute little spot on a really beautiful stretch of shops and cafes. Full of flowers and plants, creating a really relaxing ambience. Food was really good. The crepes are really delicious, but a little heavy. Pace yourself with your order. We ordered a super cheesy appetizer, and savory crepes, which resulted in us not having dessert because we were so full after that huge meal. Great place to try out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This was definitely the best place we went to on our vacation. The combination of live music and waiting staff service is unbeatable. I regret not being able to go here more than once while I was in Montreal. If you're around the area for vacation, you have to check this spot out!"}
