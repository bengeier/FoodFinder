{"text":"Just had lunch at Miki's. I love the place. Small, intimate, and great food. I'll definitely be coming back to this great restaurant"}
{"text":"We were really disappointed the first time we went . Service was so slow that we wondered if we would ever be waited on and it took forever for the average style meals to arrive. First times are the most important and this place failed in every way. There is nothing there to bring us back for another try."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. I've had several different dishes here and they're all good. When ordering the fish, be prepared, it's a huge piece. Great hosts here. They're going to expand to the suite next door to allow for more seating. It's crowded here at times so be prepared to wait a few minutes. Scrumptious desserts also."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday.  Place was not too busy.  Service was very slow, took a long time for someone to come take our order and some time for food to come to the table.  My club sandwich was a bit dry, fries were pale and limp.  My friends apparently had better luck. One had a tuna melt, the other a hot dog with all the toppings.  I might go again and try something else, but there are nearby places with better service and better food."}
{"text":"Very nice family owned places, breakfast is good, pancakes weren't my favorite but everything else was good. Reasonably priced. I'd come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are sitting here at Miki's for the 4th time and the food and service are as good as our 1st visit.  The quality of the food is outstanding and the people there make you feel like honored guests in their home.  Highly recommend to everyone.  Prices are unbelievably reasonable."}
{"text":"Miki's place is perfect for a quick bite. Casual dining options that won't make you question the bill. Very good portions  and prices. Comfort food on a clean, friendly atmosphere. Great service. Open kitchen format. I get breakfast there often and sometimes lunch. I need to check out dinner as well. Can't wait. If you're in Matthews and want to try a new place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Average diner food with average service and cramped  dumpy decor. Nothing special but ok for a quick  meal."}
{"text":"Finally a great Coney Island style restaurant w/ some southern sole! Great selection and the food is excellent. Friendly service and fast! A must try for the area."}
{"text":"Nice spot with fresh food whether it be lunch or dinner. Good breakfast specials. Employees are friendly, helpful and fast. Nice decor inside. A great establishment for Matthews."}
{"text":"Love eating at Miki's. Food is delicious love the atmosphere love the waiter named Al he is great. We there about 3 or 4 times a week love Miki he is so very friendly with everyone."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Miki's twice now I love it. Mickey and his wife give awesome customer service not to mention the food is delicious.  The first time I went I had country-style steak over rice macaroni and cheese and fried zucchini  my mom also ordered the fried squash and my dad ordered the fried okra so we had a sample of everything and they were all wonderful but my favorite was the fried zucchini. the country-style steak was delicious,  I have had country-style steak everywhere it's one of my favorites but this was the best. The macaroni and cheese is homemade creamy and yummy.  Today when I went I ordered the chicken quesadilla which comes with green peppers mushrooms and cheese, it was also very good the the tortilla was Crisp but not to Crisp and the chicken was tender and juicy my family and I will be back at Miki's many times if you haven't tried it yet go!"}
{"text":"Food was not good. Right from the first sip or coffee and bite of food we knew it was not good. My wife and I have eaten at several family restaurants and this ranks at the bottom. When we commented on the taste of the food, the waitress asked my wife if she was pregnant--very innaprostriate. Would not recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"Great... and I mean great little place to eat where you can relax and enjoy a freshly cooked and hot meal !! My lunch was excellent, piping hot from the kitchen and very reasonably priced. I WILL be back and hope to enjoy every thing on the menu.... eventually"}
{"text":"I appreciate that the owner hires friends and family members and their children, but not everyone is server material. Server was a bit scatter brained and the salads were brought out at the end of the meal after asking. Food was fine but def not soulfood as one review stated.  I hate to say it, but everything reminded me of Americana Restaurant in Matthews. Except it doesnt meet their standards. I dont know about you, but i prefer the original not a knockoff especially at the same price point."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I only came in because the store I wanted to go to wasn't open yet. I was so happy I came here because the owners are so friendly and the food is so good plus it's not expensive at all. They have home fries for breakfast which you can't find at too many places plus the ones they make here are not greasy. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service!! I haven't had anything there for breakfast, lunch or dinner that wasn't good. Try the fried zucchini - it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local eateries, no matter what time of day.  Breakfast is my favorite and they do a great job.  They even have livermush, which is a 50/50 proposition around here."}
{"text":"I ordered salmon cakes, collard greens and rice with gravy.  Everything was good although the salmon cakes seemed like they were reheated more than once.  My daughter ordered marinated chicken, cabbage and mac 'n' cheese.  This was her second time ordering everything which tells you something.  The cabbage was some of the best that I've ever tasted.  I also got a corn muffin, my daughter a roll.  Very friendly family.  I think this restaurant will be around for awhile.  The second time I ordered grilled salmon which was too dry.  Don't recommend that.  The veggies are great however.  Its a smallish restaurant.  Maybe seven to eight booths and five or six tables.  All were full.  I don't think the restaurant has been open a year yet and already has a following. Wide menu selection, lots of specials and good prices.  Will be back for the veggies alone.  Update: I've since had the chicken tenders with rice and gravy which is my go to dish now.  It's very good.  And of course I've never been disappointed with the sides.  The cornbread is also a winner."}
{"text":"While our son got a haircut, three of us stopped into Miki's for lunch.  We had a Reuben and 2 vegetable plates.  All of our selections were very good.  The selections were two pickled beets, one fried zucchini, one potato salad, one Lima beans, and one Mac 'n' cheese.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"11:45 a.m., ISO breakfast and thought I'd try the new kid in town.   Not busy at all BUT they were DONE with breakfast?  Forced me to take my appetite around the corner to Mxxxx Dxxxx.  Baked goods in display case looked good, maybe the next time?"}
{"text":"Food was incredible (had an omelette) and server was good. Small space for the crowd that was filtering in for brunch, but are apparently expanding. Breakfast menu is basic, haven't been for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS Excellent!!  The staff is the friendliest I have ever seen.  The Owner is the nicest man on the planet.  If you haven't tried the shrimp, BBQ, Veggies, you are missing out.  Definitely a great place with a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, prices, and service.  Definitely will be a regular from now on.  I would have never found this spot without YELP.  Servers were very friendly and made us feel right at home on our first trip.  We Loved the fried chicken and chicken pita."}
{"text":"The Panthers Breakfast Platter is amazing and less than $9! I have had their meatloaf and it wasn't my favorite so I haven't done dinner here again, but have been multiple times for their breakfast and it's not to miss. The staff is also very nice!"}
{"text":"Around the front side of this strip mall is a somewhat more populated (and perhaps more popular) diner. But on the backside you will find this lovely gem that is something of a diamond in the rough.  The staff is welcoming, almost like you are coming into their home. Of course, their home is somewhat larger than most, as it can seat a couple dozen. And they have a large menu. But still, it's a friendly place, and they are happy to have you.  For the most part, it's your rather typical meat and vegetable place that is somewhat dying these days, with the main difference being that the vegetable list is long. Really long. There had to be a couple of dozen options to choose from, which makes for a really interesting process. And of course, you can even choose for a vegetable plate.  Definitely a worthwhile stop, and makes checking the backside to be a worthwhile endeavor."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! The food and service is wonderful--it is a *classic* diner. And now they have more seating. The expansion is wonderful, with beautiful bathrooms, too. And on top of this, breakfast is SUCH a great deal. You can eat breakfast here for well under $8 (including a generous tip!)"}
{"text":"We tried Miki's for the first time this morning upon multiple recommendations. I found the my meal (eggs and pancakes) to be inexpensive but bland. Maybe we'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"My parents have been bugging me to come try their favorite restaurant for the last few months, today they finally got me in there.  All I can say is wow. From the moment you walk in the door the entire staff is so friendly and welcoming. The servers are wonderful. And I was so impressed with the owner and his wife, who both come by and chat with customers, making sure that everyone is not only having a great meal, but also having a great day. I'll be honest, sitting down for a meal here feels much more like sitting down with family than sitting down in a restaurant. I can't say enough good things about the warm and welcoming atmosphere here. The menu has a great selections of entrees, sandwiches, and sides....omg the selection of sides that they have to offer is amazing! I ordered the Reuben and was so so happy with my decision! I haven't had a Reuben that good since the last time I was up north. It was the best I've been able to find in the the south! My parents informed me that everything they have ever had there has been amazing (and they eat there about 2-3 times a week), but they highly recommend the chicken fried chicken! And the deserts!!!...mindblowingly good and homemade!!! This place is a bit of a drive for me, but I will be back again and again! Every aspect of this place is amazing! I have never been so pleased with a restaurant experience in my life. I completely understand what my parents see in this place, and I hope to become a regular now myself!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood feel inside.  Have not had a bad meal yet and we go 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Terrific restsurant...ask for Jennifer..shy  but always gets the orders right...friendly atmosphere and very tasty food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a quick meal. I had the chicken pita which was delicious. Also has a side salad which surprised me with pickles. It was pretty good as well. The best part is how inexpensive it is. I recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was average at best! My salmon cake looked like a flat pancake. Did not taste like any salmon was in it just bread! The green beans were over cooked a mushy! My side salad, beside being very small, had no taste! Lettuce was wet a transparent so was the one cucumber! No light dressing. so the salad dressing I did get poured like molasses in January! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant with good food. We came in on a Sunday morning for breakfast. Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry and ready to eat, skip that other new place.  Instead of waiting 45 minutes, we opted for Miki's.  Initially, I thought the restaurant was not open because there weren't any cars parked in front.  However, it was open as Yelp said it was.  We were quickly seated and our order was taken pronto.  I ordered the salmon cake (1) with lima beans (the kids hate them so this was an opportunity for me to enjoy them), and fried apple sticks.  The salmon was a bit on the dry side, the lima beans were plain, and the apple sticks were edible.  Overall, I am giving a 3/5 rating as service was excellent, the atmosphere was welcoming, and I didn't have to wait to be seated.  I will visit Miki's again to give them another try to impress me enough to return a third time."}
{"text":"Great personal service and quality food! Recommend to anyone wanting a quality meal fast and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. We wanted brunch, but we're only given the lunch menu and were told \"that's all there is\".   We had a hard time deciding. The waitress \"joked\" and said if we didn't know what we wanted she would kick us out.  After we ordered, she said \"see, it wasn't that hard\"   The food was good, good portions, good quality.  We felt rushed, she brought the check before we were even half way done."}
