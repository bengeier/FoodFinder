{"text":"Visited again last week and found better service---very quick, very efficient, and friendly. Fried Lake Erie perch are still great, and a bargain at lunch. Only issues that fell short of five stars: Pasta side was a little overcooked, had not had that happen before, and salads are excellent but make sure they shake the dressing before they put it into the little cups--mine was 99% oil (but they brought me some vinegar to fix it). Nice little outside patio--very attractive. Noticed a new flat screen TV. The best bread in town. More people should come here--friendly people, great food at reasonable prices, and not a chain--what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Northfield Inn is quite possibly one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in the area!  Their food is always prepared to my liking and is truly homemade.  I especially enjoy their pasta with red clam sauce.  This is truly a family run business and they care about all of their customers!  If you are in the neighborhood to gamble at the Rocksino it's definitely worth going there for dinner!  P.S. The bread is unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night and only 5 tables were occupied. ..big red flag. One of the specials was scrod. It was awful. Highlight was the sweet little server who was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Go there often.  They have the best veal around. I always get the veal Parmesan perfect!  Great bread!  Service has always been good.  My friend loves the eggplant Parmesan"}
{"text":"A riveting time. Happy 80th birthday grandma. Northfield Inn provided the best hospitality you can ask for. Great service, amazing food- delicious candy treats. OMG the veal. Ding Dong - there's the door bell. Gotta go. I can't even. Cheers"}
{"text":"Walked out bfore ordering! Went for a quiet dinner. However, there was a very loud intoxicated man singing and talking vulgar at the bar. The bar staff and patrons proceeded to try and out-shout each other, laugh boisterously, and generally, making everyone else in the resturant miserable. The wait staff apologized over and over and voiced our complaint to the bar tender but the problem was never handled."}
{"text":"I had the best meal of my life here. It reminded me of the food my grandma cooked. The most authentic Italian food I have had since my grandma cooked for me, and I felt like I was breaking bread with family. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you want homemade and I mean HOMEMADE food that is prepared wonderfully and is truly Italian in every sense of the word you owe it to yourself to visit this restaurant!    This family owned restaurant serves delicious food that is as close as it gets to being prepared in my own home."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, cleanliness at a minimum (not a fan of batting away flies while eating) and bad experience with the waitstaff. I was not convinced."}
{"text":"Crappy service, no draft beer and did I mention crappy service? The waitress acted as if we were disturbing her and when I requested a glass for my bottled Bud Lite, it looks like it never saw a dishwasher in it's life! We ordered the spaghetti dinner and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can! The place seemed to be filled at the bar with regulars that got more attention than anyone at the tables. Did not feel welcomed at all since this was our first time there. I live almost around the corner from this place but I won't be going back! The only reason I gave it one star is the food didn't make me sick!"}
{"text":"While on my vacation I've been on a quest to try restaurants in Northeast Ohio that are not big box chain. This restaurant has been around since the 60s in Northfield. Our waitress Grace has been then for over 20 years. If you're looking for some hip looking restaurant I suggest you go across the street to the Rocksino and patron one of their restaurants. If you're looking for commercialized food then go to Olive Garden.  Northfield Inn decor is old and not updated, but it's quiet. The food is made from scratch, even the desserts."}
{"text":"I will start and say the stuffed hot peppers were hot and very good. The restaurant was not very busy but it took 30 minutes to just get water because they needed to wash glasses. The service was crazy slow.   The lasagna was not very good. But even though mine was pre made ie just needed heated up. Mine was last to come out by a long shot.  And to compound things I jammed my head into the tv. Warning don't sit in the corner of your close to 6'."}
{"text":"Solid place. Dated atmosphere, but the food was good, service was attentive, and the prices were reasonable. It has a laid-back bar feel and primarily a home-cooked Italian menu with some local fish specials. Definitely a home-town kind of restaurant. Closes early.   Get the veal parm."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time with my whole family for my grandma's 80th birthday. Great service and atmosphere! The veal parmigiana was amazing!"}
