{"text":"I had high hopes for Belle, but sadly, it didn't quite deliver. The service was fast, friendly and attentive, and the presentation was great. The rest wasn't so hot. We started with the duck wings. They were tasty, nicely Frenched and flavourful drumettes, but at $14 for 5, ($2.80 each) it's hard to justify ordering. For our main, we ordered The Big Britches ($29). The portions were very small...2 ribs, 5 thin slices of brisket and 1 chicken wing with a bit of breast attached - definitely not enough to share. It came out cold, and none of it could stand on its own without the side sauces (all 3 flavours of which were good). The chicken was dry despite being brined. If you're going to serve cauliflower slaw, the flavours need to be bold, and seasoning needs to be sufficient. It fell flat. The blue cheese potato salad was great though. On the whole, it was disappointing. I probably won't return, despite working across the street. You're much better off heading to Hayden Block in Kensington. Same high prices, but the flavours deliver."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good. Server was pretty bad tho. Comparable to others in the city. Would be better than 3 of 5, but that service...."}
{"text":"This place had a great happy hour, live music, great service, lots of gluten-free options. Salads were super yummy but in a smoke house/bbq place this SHOULDN'T be the highlight. We had the platter+brisket ends to try a bit of everything. The meat was fatty and save for salt, flavorless. If they can get some flavour in their meat, I could see this place lasting long time, if not......"}
{"text":"BBQ done right.  Nicely renovated space with picnic table seating, as well as tables.  Full bar that seats 15-20.  Live music on Friday and Saturdays.  The atmosphere is casual.  The server provided homemade chips when we sat down. These are tasty, and handy for sampling the three types of BBQ sauce on the table - spicy, Carolina mustard and Coffee Bourbon BBQ sauce.  All three are terrific.  I had the brisket, which was delicious. There are a number of available sides. Tried the cucumber salad.  Ok, but next time it will be the blue cheese potato salad.  I will certainly go back, and will update when I do."}
{"text":"We are always excited to see another bbq place open up in Calgary! Especially when they do things right!   The meats were all seasoned and smoked well, sides were delicious (hooray for hatch chili hush puppies), the service was friendly and attentive and the ambience really chill (great play list btw). Loved the fact that there was a parking lot right in front and that the restaurant is beautiful inside and out!   Hits: St. Louis ribs had a nice smoke ring and well-seasoned crust. The Fried Green Tomatoes were firm and held together well in a perfect cornmeal crust.   Miss: Side portion of beans were generous, but could have been cooked just a bit longer for our liking. Burnt ends were delicious, but a bit pricy at $9 for the portion."}
{"text":"We came here for an australia day celebration. The place was very noisy. Hard to hear anyone on the same table that was not next to you. They're food is good quallity although their customer service was popr . Brisket, green fried tomatoes, southern chicken, and ribs were good.. my kids ordered the ribs which came out half cooked!!! Had a hard tome locating the sevrer to complain about the uncooked ribs. Got a denial and indifferent response when we finally did.   My wife and i ordered the brisket and southern chicken, our server took it upon herself to assume we wanted it on a combined plate( even though we were seated apart by 2 spaces!!!! Eventually when the food came out. I had asked where my meal was. We were told that it was on ur wifes plate. No offer to get another plate.  Must've been running short on plates!!!! To top the night off we ordered the pavlova for my kids. The dish was over priced and pathetically small coming out on a saucer sized plate.  In the end  it was pretty much fruit and cream little to no meringue. Poor effort Belle!!!!!!!!!  We'll try plenty of other places rather than come back here"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with live music Friday and Saturday nights. It could get a bit loud in here and we found it a bit hard to chat across the table at times. They have daily happy hour specials from 5-7pm which has amazing deals. It is kid friendly and reservations are available. I got the turkey leg which was marinaded nicely inna bourbon glaze and the side of hush puppies that I ordered on the side was to die for.. totally recommend this. The fried mac & cheese looked delicious and kid approved. Hubby got the ribs with potato salad and said both was really good. The peanut butter pie was served in a little Mason jar and was more of a mousse than a pie and I don't think it's worth $7. Overall i liked this place and would come back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great bbq restaurant, awesome flavours and presentation. I definitely recommend this restaurant and will be coming back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the brisket tips and the fried green tomatoes,  Have been a few times and never been disappointed, staff are friendly, know their product and the service top notch. I had the burger and a cucumber salad one night, I like you can choose the size of your burger (1 patty or 2) and a variety of sides The half order of smoked brisket was more than enough for one meal, got a lunch out of it too.  Try it"}
{"text":"Great place for live music and BBQ on the weekend! We went here Saturday night for some drinks and late night snacks and were very impressed. The \"smokey\" ceaser was super different (it had scotch and BBQ sauce in it) but was really good. We also tried the burnt brisket ends - which were incredibly flavorful and the squash pupies which were like spicy zucchini cornfritter balls and were also delicious. Alex Zayas played fantastic blues music but was not too loud so everyone could still chat. If you really want to hear the music be sure to sit close to the little stage area! Overall we were impressed by the food quality, prices, and ambiance. A great new spot on 4th!"}
{"text":"Went here as my friend lives close by, had the brisket and blue cheese potatoe salad. The potatoe salad was very tasty, the brisket on the other hand was very tough, brisket should be able to be cut just by fork and should have pink smoke rings. This brisket did not. I do have very high expectations as I have had some of the best brisket the world has to offer . I hope they get the brisket figured out !"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the decor is great. They've done a great job designing the place. I just wish they spent a bit more time on, and attention to, the menu and service. Both were weak. The food is overpriced and mostly bland - generally uninspired. Not what you would expect from a niche bbq restaurant. Honestly if you're a true bbq fan, you will likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Fried green tomatoes here are everything! The food never disappoints. Also great cocktails and friendly staff.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"Being from the southern US this was a nice find. We had the grilled cauliflower steak. It was outstanding and it came with a salad. We also tried the fried green tomatoes and burnt ends. Both were very good. We really liked the mustard bbq sauce. The service was very good also. For dessert we tried the fried banana split. It was interesting. Not great, but not bad either. We will be back"}
{"text":"Love that they have parking!  The food was really good and big portions. The service was excellent we arrived early before open and they still survived us.  The patio on the side of the building was nice and shaded.  Brunch I think was a little late. If they maybe opens at 10 they would get more people rolling over from reds and obe because they were both lined up out the door."}
{"text":"If I was reviewing food only it would be a 4. With service knocks it down at least a star. We had reservations and waited 20 minutes past reservation to sit down at a very small table for 4 people. Took 15 minutes just for pop to come to the table. We decided to get the $100 meat platter to share. You'd think if you're spending $100 on meat you'd have lots left over but there wasn't. It was delicious though the brisket was amazing. A little disappointed because we asked if he sides it comes with is enough to share with 4 people they said yes but it definitely isn't they are little single servings. Parking was also a nightmare to find because their parking lot fits 8 cars. Overall if they get rid of that hostess who gives reserved tables away to walkins, they step up their service speed, turn down the music they will thrive in this location. But for now it's definitely not a place you HAVE to try."}
{"text":"The food at Belle was really good. We had the best onion rings I've ever had, the burger had American cheese, the friend green tomatoes were lovely, and the bbq was really tasty.  The service and atmosphere on the other hand need work. The restaurant was way too loud, not one person at our table of 4 heard what the hostess said to us when she seated us and I could not hear any conversation at our table unless I was leaning in. The drinks took forever to come to our table and our food arrived 1 hour after ordering. Our server was nowhere to be seen. I did mention to him that the wait was unacceptable, I was told the kitchen burned the burger.  It's really too bad as there was obviously a lot of effort put into the back house, unfortunately not in the front house."}
{"text":"My new fav smokehouse/southern joint in town. Hayden block and Big Ts couldn't get their hush puppies right - this is the first place to impress me. Tried the fried green tomatoes, 1/2 lb St Louis ribs and the hot chicken sandwich. Ribs are tender and fall off the bone. They taste great with their homemade bbq sauce trio. Side choices were the hush puppies and the deep fried mac. both delish. Will def return for $8 happy hour cocktails and to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.. but the live music is so loud you can barely hear anything... on from 5-7 so you're deaf by the end of dinner. They give you some chips at the beginning of the meal and you can try their BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"The bbq was so delicious! Brisket was tender and juicy, you could tell it was slow cooked for days. The fried Mac and cheese was amazing. Small area but it was intimate and casual. Very friendly staff. They offer live music Friday's and Saturday's. We are from texas and we approve this bbq!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Tuesday evening at 5:30pm and found ample parking in the front lot. Seated right away and the menu was well explained. Order the burnt rib tips (absolutely amazing and would order tons of these in their own next time) and the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. The tomatoes were supremely well cooked and firm and not greasy. The pickle slices were so good we asked for, and got, more! For a main course we shared 1/2lb of brisket (excellent) and a pound of St Louis ribs (also excellent but 1/2lb would have been enough) and the blackened fish with tomato relish (tender and mild). With sides of potato wedges (had no room to do these justice), cauliflower coleslaw (amazing and a must have!) and the blue cheese potato salad (excellent too!). The star was the 3 bbq sauces - with thick home cooked chips to test them out with presented upon arrival. The three sauces all had standout flavor and enhanced the meats! A competent server that was friendly. The only thing lacking was more noise/atmosphere but as they've only been open 2 weeks this is still building. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays and reservations accepted! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Belle and it was very good. The waiter was attentive and checked back often without being pushy.   The menu has a good selection including gluten and vegetarian options. There are a ton of sides to chose from so you can really have something different every time.  I had the brisket with cauliflower slaw. The brisket was cooked very well and the selection of sauces at the table added a ton of flavour.  The price was reasonable and there was a lot of food.  I am happy to see a place like this in Mission and will be back. I look forward to also trying some of the excellent selection of Bourbons they had on hand."}
{"text":"Not bad! Not bad at all!   Still relatively new and working out a few kinks but over all a satisfying dining experience.   Their bbq sauces are great, and have a few different ones to choose from. The brisket I ordered was a bit fatty for my liking but had great flavour. The sides are a nice spin on the classics.   Look forward to heading back and trying out some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Not bad! Full Southern vibe with picnic tables, wooden baskets, homey decor and Southern music. They have a pretty large whiskey menu (of course), so if you're a whiskey person this place is right up your alley. Despite it being 7pm, the place was pretty quiet on a weekday night, which I didn't overly mind. We had our choice of seating and the server was polite and attentive. You get some chips to start which is great cause it's the perfect way to sample the house made bbq sauces on the table.   A friend and I shared a lb of ribs, 1/2 chicken, deep fried mac and cheese and chilli hushpuppies. The ribs were fall of the bone with a subtle rub and the chicken was also cooked well without it being too dry. I enjoyed the mac and cheese but was disappointed because it was a little wedge, it was good I wanted more! The hush puppies were also surprisingly delicious because I'm not normally a fan of cornmeal-based bread. A bit of butter really brings out the chili flavour and all over is really soft and the perfect little bite.   Overall, I enjoyed it! I'm excited to return and try out other items on their menu."}
