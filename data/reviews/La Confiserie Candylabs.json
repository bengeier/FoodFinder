{"text":"Its literally the taste of rainbow in your mouth. You definitely have to try these once in your life, although the prices are a little bit expensive it's worth the try."}
{"text":"The candy in the jar all glommed together into a big blob within a few weeks after purchase. As someone who is not a hard-candy connoisseur, I forgot about the cardinal rule of hard candies -- don't leave out in the sun or someplace warm!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with this little shop full of sweets and confections. It's not often you come across a candy shop with handmade sweets like these, so it was a real treat to be able to visit.

The staff is very friendly, eager to tell you about their treats and to let you try any of the flavors you were curious about.

The candies themself where amazing, coming in many wonderful flavors, with some having more creative and unique flavors. They are light and airy, which adds to the taste of the candies, making them rather addictive to eat.

That's not even touching on the little pieces of art in each one of these candies! It makes you want to take the time and look at each candy before devouring it. 

There are little pieces of cute candy art scattered around the store which are fun to find and look at.
They also give you a little bag of extra candy if you make a purchase of more than 20$, which is pretty easy to do since you end up wanting to buy a lot of their sweets!

So tl:dr Wonderful store, amazing candy with lots of flavors, would absolutely recommend to people with a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"The cutest & sweetest little store! 

A bit hidden near the Concordia metro, is this cute little store filled with cute, hand made and filled with original designs candy. 
Curious to know how the candy is created? Call them around noon and ask them when the next batch of candy will be made. Yes, seriously! They will tell you a precise time and you will be fascinated to see how a simple ingredient as sugar can be transformed into cute little things! 
Because it's handmade(absolutely no machines!) and made in small amounts, you know what that means. It's slightly pricey. Indeed it is. I won't lie. 
Their flavourful come on such wide variety, they are tasty and not at all artificial tasting. 
If you have a sweet and curious craving, I highly recommend you stop by!"}
{"text":"Handcrafted candy - yes please! If you're a candy aficionado you must make a stop here to see and try their custom candy creations. It's not your regular coloured hard candies. Look closely you will see intricate designs of fruit, animals, words and popular kids characters like Pikacu or Minions in the candy's centre. Take a candy and hold it up to the light to see the detail before popping into your mouth to enjoy. You can try as many flavours you like before you commit to one flavour or mix. It's really hard to choose. From the subtle fruit flavours of apple to bold of mango. I decided on character candies and mixes. That is the best of both worlds, a variety of flavours and designs. Their fizz candies, champagne flavour, were also tasty. Come here if you have a sweet tooth and walk away with little pieces of edible art."}
{"text":"Hidden gem - a must visit if you are heading to Montreal.  Friendly staffs and great packaging, the test tubes cost about $4.50 , perfect gift ideas. The fuzzy root beer and guava pandas are my favourite.   They are all handmade, cute, very tasty !"}
{"text":"Although they are a bit expensive, the candy here is top notch. They have so many flavours in all these cute containers like Erlenmeyer's and test tubes. The store is very colourful and inviting. The staff is really nice and they give lots of demonstrations. 

They will let you have a sample of you aren't sure which flavour you want. 

My personal favourite is peach. I think it's sweet and tasty. 

It's a great spot to get a cute candy gift for someone or a treat for yourself."}
{"text":"Nice decor candy store. They also give workshops on making customized candies. I found staffs are nice. Price for candies is reasonable because they are in high quality."}
{"text":"Their candies are excellent. They also custom made candies for my wedding and they were delivered on time and they were exactly what we asked for! Thanks!"}
{"text":"THE HARD CANDIES HERE ARE SO GOOD. They all have different designs and tastes, packaged in little test tubes and Erlenmeyer flasks. Some even have special designs of cartoon characters like pokemon, minions and baymax. Very cute and nerdy at the same time. Perfect for gifts. The owner was also very nice and offered samples before we purchased.  However, it is a bit on the pricier side but still worth it once in a while imo (or as a gift)."}
{"text":"While hard candies and suckers aren't generally the candy of choice for me (hook me up to a chocolate IV, and we're good), I can make an exception for La Confiserie Candylabs. This itty-bitty, slightly hidden boutique storefront is worth the trip. In fact, the last few times we spent a weekend in Montreal, we went out of our way to visit.

In an era that puts emphasis on quality, artisan, handmade everything, why not extend that to candies? These people give a lot of attention to the details, of which there are many. The delicate candies that are mostly no bigger than a pencil-top eraser, have impossibly cute and teensy designs on each one, and come in upward of 20 flavors. Can't decide which one to buy? No problem. The very helpful staff will let you sample almost any flavor they carry.

I'm also excited to say that Candylabs will do custom candies, if you ever feel the need. Which, obviously I do...for my wedding! For around $300 American, you get 3 kilos of custom candies. Ours will be in our wedding colors, with a D (heart) A in the center. They were super friendly about helping us with messages, colors, and flavors, and even invited us to come back at a time of our choosing to watch them make the candies. We're pretty excited to do that.

Individual glass packs of candies are on the spendy side, so in an instance like our wedding, we'll be taking candies home in bulk instead of in lab tube or glass bottles, but it's definitely something to grab for someone as a gift or souvenir."}
{"text":"I did some research before visiting Montreal and decided that this was a place I wanted to check out. It's a small space, kind of easy to miss, but definitely worth a stop if you like candy. The young woman helping us had many recommendations, gave us many samples, and was generally extremely helpful. 

I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicious decisions hard candies!!!!! And freshly made! What a beautiful idea for a candy store!

I bought a small $6 pack to share for Valentine's Day weekend. Took the little pack to school and wished everyone (who didn't skip class for love) a sweet day.

They are very delicious and super popular immediately. Everyone asked for seconds and the little bag lasted three classes!

The fruity candies are so good. The soda ones are even better! I love the 7-up and the fruity soda flavours.

There is a candy for everyone. Everyone ELSE that is, which explains the 4 stars from me. For candy loving customers, we cannot choose what we want like jellybeans. For example, if I want the soda flavour I have to buy the beautiful box or the beautiful jar for a small amount of candy. Most of my money goes into this packaging as opposed to the candy. For gifts, yes that's great. If I want just candy, I will collect too many beautiful jars I don't need.

This is a gift shop, not a candy store. 

But seriously, everybody I handed these to absolutely loved them! I bought the sweet fruity pack. The watermelon is the most popular."}
