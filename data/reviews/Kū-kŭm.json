{"text":"Very interesting menu consisting of First Nations cuisine. Me and my wife decided to give this place a try after hearing so much about it and wanted to explore some uncommon food. 

We started the evening with the elk, rabbit liver and 5 game appetizer combo which we liked. For the main, I had the seared seal which has a liver like taste and I loved it. My wife had the caribou which she had mixed feelings about. The dessert was a rose infused panna cotta with saskatoon berries and lavender shortcake, which was also a success in my book. 

The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. The price is on the slightly expensive side but I think it's worth it for such a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Everything about this cozy place is lovely and amazing. The food is delectable--the chef is a genius at simplicity, creating dishes that are gorgeous yet uncomplicated. The flavours of the ingredients take centre stage. We had the Arctic Trio (the seal was potent but tasty), the absolutely delicious caribou, and, since they were out of one of the desserts, they indulged us by mixing the plum ice cream with their feathery, buttery shortbread and, my prairie girl favourite, saskatoons. The light and airy bannock also deserves special commendation. Kudos!"}
{"text":"The braised venison.. seriously, I could eat this every day for the rest of my life.
I ordered the taste experience menu and it was great fusion food. Favourites for me were the 3 Sisters soup which was hearty and soul warming, the sorbet, the halibut - which was perfectly cooked and had flavourful creme sauce with roe - and the creme brule was delicious.
But my god - the venison - i spent half the dinner oogling my friend's dinner until they offered me a piece and it was melt in your mouth.
Do yourself a favour and check this place out - the Chef really knows how to cook his meat... and everything else!"}
{"text":"Great and interesting indigenous cuisine!  Home made gin tonic; Puff wild rice;  seal pate;  goose puff pastry;  caribou...they all tasted great and looked beautiful!"}
{"text":"Brunch

Not aware of any indigenous restos, so had bookmarked this place as I read abt it on TO Life. Cozy and super friendly place with a chilled out vibe. Loved everything we ate, food had the taste/texture of eating in someone's kitchen.

The brunch menu will be overhauled, and I think the same for lunch and dinner. I've still attached the dinner menu here, to give readers a sense of the interesting selection of Cdn game from  seal to venison. 


Pro-tip: be patient for the food to be plated.

Repeat: will be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I think the concept is great and we need more options in the city. I hope it's just growing pains, or maybe the night I went...

What I liked:
-Friendly service
-Great decor
-Concept
- The halibut 
- Presentation

What I didn't like:
- There were only two people working the floor. They were in charge of serving and preparing cocktails. Needless to say, I had to wait for a long time to be seated (even with a reservation) and I saw two groups leaving because they didn't want to wait. 
- I thought most dishes were bland
- Price, it was a very expensive meal and I don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Been twice, it is wonderful food and great local options. I am looking forward to my next visit this spring :)"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The service was great and I liked the art and vibe of the restaurant. We really liked our appetizers which were the Arctic trio and the elk/5 game/rabbit liver. Our mains weren't as great. We found the bouillabaisse too salty and didn't really like the seal paired with beets. The fried bannock that comes with the bouillabaisse was amazing though. We really liked the lavender chocolate mousse that we had for dessert and the cedar tea that they gave us. We would come back to try the elk and caribou mains and the appetizer that has rose hip!

Ps make a reservation. It's small and was packed on a Friday night. Everyone seemed to have a reservation."}
{"text":"Not a complete stranger to indigenous food, and the options here are very good, particularly enjoyed the Canadian Sushi option, what they call the Arctic Trio; smoked trout, seal tartare and salmon....

The game options where also very good, we had the goose and the caribou, one thing about the goose, the description offered is a little misleading, it was described as a goose stew where it was actually closer in consistency to a risotto....the flavour from  the wild rice evoked that of a wild mushroom risotto.

The caribou was very good, although again the menu doesn't quite match, as it was closer to a pulled pork presentation and consistency, the flavour and tenderness though was still very good.

The new fall menu had lots of interesting options and left us thinking we will be back, as the first read came back with \"hrm, maybe one of everything\"....

The limited seating capacity does pretty much at this time require a reservation, a few people tried to \"drive-by\" while we where there, but they could not be accommodated, having said that though the service was attentive and efficient we also did not feel rushed to finish and spent nearly three hours on a Friday."}
{"text":"We went here looking for something original after eating in restaurants for 10 days  in a row on a business trip. We were not disappointed! Not  the biggest fan of the seal meat, but it was interesting, especially after the explanation of  the waiter. All the other food was great and different from everything I had before. Staff is really friendly and clearly cares about their work. Keep room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd dinner visit to Ku-kum, and I'm so happy I came back to give this place a second try. My first visit here was decent, but I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor profile of the dishes nor the tiny portion sizes. Fast forward a couple of months and everything has vastly improved. With a refreshed menu, there were a bunch of new dishes that were added. Their beer selection also has more variety now. I had the Hawberry Ale from Manitoulin Island's Split Rail Brewing company. Such a nice refreshing darker ale that went beautifully with the game meats. 

For the appetizer, we ordered a trio of meat spreads ($18) consisting of an elk rillette, rabbit liver mousse, and terrine made with five different kinds of game meats. All three were incredibly flavorful and was so good eating with the soft bread that comes on the side. We ended up having to order more bread as the two pieces that come with the dish weren't enough to eat with the large portion of the meat spread. 

For the main course, we ordered the caribou ($28) and the perch ($24). 

The caribou they slow cook for 24 hrs before stuffing in some intestine and cutting into slabs. The resulting meat had the consistency of pulled pork. Originally, I was hoping for a plain straight-out caribou steak, but I'm so glad I tried their novel way of preparing the meat. The caribou was super soft, tender, seasoned perfectly, and mixed with some root vegetables that gave it a nice crunch. The onion puree sauce was delicious and really complimented the caribou. The mashed potatoes were quite dry, but the squash was amazing. This is a dish that's definitely worth trying. 

The perch was cooked perfectly, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The bitterness from the sweet grass oil, combined with the slight natural saltiness from the salmon roe really complimented the fresh firm perch meat. Another dish that's a winner! 

After the meal, we were served a complimentary cedar tea. First time I've had this and it was very refreshing.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is decent, but the tables are placed very close together, so it feels quite cramped. Not the best place for a romantic dinner when the next table is 2 ft away. The service here is excellent, with our server extremely knowledgeable about all the dishes. The food is fantastic, and it's really great being able to try out different kinds of meat that you normally wouldn't get anywhere else. Apparently, this is the only restaurant in Ontario where you can get seal meat (tried the seal tartar on my last visit and found that it's not quite my cup of tea, but glad I tried it).

What impressed me the most is the improvement I saw since the last visit. I found the food to be much more flavorful and prepared with better technique and creativity than previously. I was also pleasantly surprised that the portion sizes have significantly increased as well. There are still many items on the menu I want to try, so will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with my family. After waiting for a while, the server explained they were out of a number of things (completely out of either seafood entree and the elk and veggie options were subbed for caribou and another root veg, as well as some wine, beer and cocktail ingredients). It's already a modest sized menu so this was disappointing, especially as a pescatarian. I ordered the replacement veg option, and instead of a roasted root vegetable gratin I was served a very sad plate of roasted root vegetables that would be better offered as a side dish. It was the most disappointing dish. There is so much more that can be done with a vegetarian option, especially with corn and beans. After a remark to the server I was told that the gratin was a lot of work and often went to waste and this was readily available (obviously because it takes no effort or imagination to roast a beet and put it on a plate). If you can't offer anything other than game meat (such as seafood and vegetarian options) then don't bother. Let us roast our own beets and carrots... so we can add grains, beans, proteins, imagination, slight effort, etc. 

The arctic trio was nice and others enjoyed their meal but the experience overall was just fine. The tea at the end of the meal was a nice touch and the decor is cool"}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate this place higher.

Heard about it when it was featured on CBC for having seal, and since I had never tried it I was intrigued.  I had previously been to an aboriginal-inspired restaurant at Keriwa Cafe on Queen West before it closed down, and we loved it (we went there over 10 times).  

We got to the restaurant, and the waitress was very enthusiastic about everything (she was very nice).  We ended up ordering the arctic trio, the seal main, a beet salad, and the Bouillabaisse.

The waitress brought the arctic trio, telling us that the trout and salmon \"cut the iron\" taste of the seal, which sounded odd.  Unfortunately I really did not like the seal.  It was incredibly \"iron-like\", it tasted like when you cut your finger and taste the blood but...strongly.  Like it tasted more like blood than meat.  The smoked rainbow trout was too salty.  The salmon was ok.  The beet salad was also just mediocre.

The seal main I thought would be better because it wasnt a \"tartare\", but it suffered from the same blood-like taste--it was unfortunately a little nauseating and ruined the rest of the meal.  Maybe our palate just isnt used to it, but it was very unpleasant.

The only plus side was the Bouillabaisse, which was sort of a seafood soup.  This was nice by contrast (and had quite a lot of meat), but was maybe a 6/10 and certainly didnt make up for us having our stomach turned a bit by the other courses.

Cool concept, but really unappetising food, and I wont be back.  Hopefully if seal pops up somewhere else, it is prepared significantly differently."}
{"text":"Excellent venison on an onion puree, wish there were more puree though. The rhubarb ice-cream had perfect texture and was very creamy, though light on the rhubarb flavor. Many interesting big game selections, will definitely return."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews about this restaurant serving Indigenous food, I was curious to try it out!  Definitely make reservations- it's a tiny spit and packed!  They had to turn away several walk-ins as there was no room.

My friends and I decided to order a few items to share - 2 mixed platter apps (elk, rabbit mousse pate, seal tartare, salmon); for mains we chose the bouillabaisse and the caribou with mushrooms and potatoes.

None of us particularly cared for the seal tartare - it didn't look appetizing and I can't even describe the flavour - it just wasn't our thing.  The rabbit and elk were delicious.  The salmon was slightly too sweet for our liking - I believe it was candied - none of us took to it.  

I found the caribou a bit too heavy for me but the seafood bouillabaisse was spot on.  The broth was flavourful and there were definitely lots of seafood in the dish.  We scooped up all the broth with our bread!

The service is really friendly and if you have any questions they will provide answers/recommendations.

It's a bit tight in here so might be difficult with a stroller but this is definitely a place to check out if you are curious about trying a different cuisine that's underrated in Toronto"}
{"text":"Kukum is low-key slowly becoming my favourite restaurant in the city -- the first time, I came here for dinner and the second time for weekend brunch.  And I'm estatic they are now open for lunch.

So, I get it -- there's a lot of press and hype about the restaurant.  Despite living in the area, I was initially only interested because of the seal meat... or more accurately, because of the shrill outcry of animal rights activist attracted me here... cuz... fuck 'em.

So, everyone tries the seal meat.  In short, the seal tartare didn't strike me one way or the other and I probably won't order it again (might try the seared seal loin before I write it off completely).  However, once you ignore the 'gimmick' dish -- the chef is damned skilled and we really enjoyed the seafood bouillabaisse and elk loin - the accompanying vegetables were spectacular.  The service and presentation were excellent.  And honestly, I felt it was a decent value.  You're getting really original dishes for about $20 - $30 for a dinner entree... I've paid the same for burgers and fries at shitty pubs.

I thought that Kukum was going to be a 'one-and-done' place for me.  Try seal meat, snap some pics for the 'Gram and tilt some crybabies - #loldealwithit.  And the narrative is... complicated.  I appreciate there's some Indigenous cuisine being represented, it makes me cringe hard when some people think patronizing a restaurant like this is worth signaling in some sad attempt to assuage 'white guilt'.  Don't get me wrong - I appreciate someone being a flag-bearer for their community and culture... but at the same time, I don't think all cuisine is worthy of celebration (shrug).

At the end of the day, we wanted to go back.  Food was good, value is there and it was an experience - ignore the narrative, it's a solid place.

We went back for weekend brunch.  Which is the gantlet for me - typically overpriced bullshit, it was the true test.  If I can have brunch at Kukum and walk away sated and not feeling ripped off, I might love this place.

And the Caribou Hash with fried egg for $16 was stellar.  Would probably be too gamey for some, but it was so tender and flavourful for me.  The lady got a seared tuna dish which was on special and it was damned near artistic in presentation.  However, I must say that $4 for coffee/tea is a bit crazy.

Skimming around the other reviews, I can understand why some people feel disappointed. However, I can only advise people to ignore the hype and narrative and come in with an open mind.  You'll probably won't find a life-changing experience that some 'best of...' list would have you believe.  However, if you keep in mind that it's a local restaurant offering some truly unique dishes at reasonable prices -- you'll probably be impressed.  And honestly, for me, it's much more difficult to become a restaurant that I can and will become a 'regular' at... than a one-time 'zOMG so gooood' restaurant that you will probably never go back to.  Will be back for lunches, dinners and brunches."}
{"text":"First time hearing about Indigenous cuisine and just had to come here with a couple of friends to experience such a unique culinary treat.

The decor was an earthy themed restaurant and gave a very natural ambience with all the natural light coming in.

Our server was so bubbly and it was such a delight to feel appreciated as a customer being looked after by her.

Let's talk food:

[Methinks not] Maple Water ($5): Dubbed the \"new coconut water\" by health-foodies, this trendy drink is considered eco-friendly because it is harvested by tapping into the tree instead of cutting it down--lots of electrolytes! Even so, $5 a glass is a bit steep. 

[Interesting but not my cup of tea] Arctic Trio | Beet & Maple Cured Salmon, Seal Tartare, and Cold Smoked Arctic Char with Whitefish Roe ($22): This is a starter but so generously portioned that it is recommended you share it with friends. The cured salmon is tasty where you can taste notes of maple fused into the salmon. It also came with the seal tartare with a quail egg on top. We found it extremely \"iron-rich\" (aka extremely bloody) and frankly too rare for our liking. Despite such, it is an absolute must-try to understand that depending on some philosophies, traditional aboriginal may include diets of raw meat consumption.

[Delicious!] Roasted Elk crusted with Juniper and Spruce Tips served with Turnip and Jerusalem Artichokes($26): The meat was very akin to a nice and succulent beef steak; moist and tender. A bit too rare, but still not bad.

[VERY GOOD] Braised Venison, Butternut Squash, Parsnips, and Roasted Onion Purée ($28): Meat was cooked quite well; tender and moist just like the elk. For some reason the parsnip and onion purée just complimented the who dish so well. However, again, it was a bit too rare. Perhaps next time ask for well done, because it seems like the regular standard of medium rare is different from this restaurant's definition of medium rare (you can see the blood flowing out).

[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] Pan Seared Halibut with Roasted Parsnip, Onion Puree, and Jerusalem Artichoke Veloute ($22): This dish was just so good with the butter being infused into the fish. Again, the vegetable smears just blended in so well with the whole ensemble. I loved how the caviar gave the halibut such a nice texture. The only thing was it was a bit overcooked, because the flesh was quite hard. Nonetheless, hope they nail this dish down the next time.

Super happy we finally made a trip to come out and try something different."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing and creative menu. Really enjoyed the tasting menu. Service was super nice and friendly. But it was a little hard to get a table."}
{"text":"When I heard about the concept of the restaurant I was intrigued. At first glance when walking into the restaurant, the decor looked very nice and with a very cozy feel. The 1 star is a result of the service being on point; but the food gets a 0.

We ordered the Arctic Trio ($22), Caribou ($28) and Seared Seal ($28). The arctic trio was served with smoked rainbow trout, seal tartare with salmon roe and beet cured salmon. The salmon had the texture consistency of sashimi and not like a cured piece of fish. The seal tartare was bland and the salmon roe combination was kind of weird; like salted iron. The rainbow trout was tasty with a good amount of smoke. 

The Caribou was dry and bland. Duchess potato extremely dry. There wasn't much taste to the mushrooms; not earthy at all. The onion puree was pretty good and the piece of squash was nice. 

The seal dish was a disaster. Seared seal served with beets, micro crest and a maple dressing. The whole dish was way too sweet with the beets and the maple sauce. Not enough seasoning on the seal and it just tasted too much like iron. The micro greens garnish was buried underneath all the food. This dish was missing an acidic/spicy component. I informed my server that i did not like the dish at all; it was not comped.

The menu is definitely over priced. I did not have a good experience at all; but if you are going to eat here, do yourself a favour and don't get anything with seal in it."}
{"text":"I came here for a celebration with my significant other, and opted to go with the main menu so that we could try the Arctic Trio ($22), which came with seal tartare with whitefish roe and fish oil, cold smoked Arctic char, and beet and maple cured salmon. All three were deliciously rich and served with a sweet bread, though the seal tasted more iron-rich than I would have liked. 

The entrees were incredible: the halibut was meaty but delicate, and the elk was tender. I ordered Sandstone ($15 per glass), as recommended for the elk, and it was a perfect pair. Root vegetables were also great. 

We shared a pine needle and citrus sorbet, and it was refreshing: it tastes how lemon and pine trees smell. 

Our server was kind and explained the menu well, and the ambience was good for a date on a rainy Friday evening. We hope to return to try the experience menu ($80). Our bill this visit was about $100. 

TL;DR: Food is delicious and the menu was well explained in a way where we didn't feel intimidated. Bill was ~$100 for two after tax. Would return."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends found out that a restaurant served seal and we had to check it out, and boy oh boy was that a great decision. This place is definitely worth checking out, and most likely worth checking out a 2nd, 3rd, and how ever many times you feel.

My friends decided to order a few items from the menu while I decided to go with the experience menu (good idea for a variety). 
My friends ordered the Arctic Trio, Elk, Labrador Tea and Wild Mint Rillettes, and Seared Seal Loin, with Beets, Watercress, and Greens. 
My experience menu had a bunch of dishes for me to try ( I hope I get them all right) : three sisters soup (carrot, squash and corn soup), fried smelts, puffed wild rice with candied beets, goose on top of a puffy pastry with mushrooms (this one is different from the menu version), seal Mousse ( i don't think it was called a mousse, but that is what it reminded me of) pine needle and citrus sorbet, caribou and goose on top of root vegetable puree, and lastly poached apple with birch syrup and roasted nuts. Everything was delicious! 

My favourite dish was the goose on puffy pastry, it was fantastic. If it was part of the regular menu I would come just for that! The seal was also delicious might I add. 

Now to talk about the best part of the restaurant! Our server Sara :D. Probably the nicest server/waitress I have ever had. Thanks for the bread again :D. 

The interior of the restaurant is warm and welcoming. A beautiful mural greets you when you enter through the front doors on the back wall. 

Overall this place is a gem and needs to be on any foodies list of restaurants! I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"We attended this restaurant during the opening week. It was crowded. Service was good. 
The menu was so much more meat-laden than I thought it would be. We had one vegetarian in the group and she was very disappointed that there were only a salad and one side dish. 

Another of our friends was a chef and she thought the food interesting but overly small portions to which I can agree! We all ordered something different and all the meals were very small. Giving new meaning to \"small food for big money\"

But the big disappointment was flavour. When you receive 2-3 bites of some food item on your plate it has to really reveal excellent taste or all is lost. Our entire table did not express interest in going back."}
{"text":"Pathetic! That's one word to describe my dinner experience tonight. We saw ku kum under the best new restaurant under Toronto life, and by looking at the menu it's definitely intriguing. 
We had a reservation for Saturday night and waited at the door for a while with no one greeting us. Not a big deal as you could see the servers talking at the back. As soon as we got seated it took around 15 mins until the server got to our table to get our order. First thing that was said if we know what to order or have any questions. No hi or hello to start. But ok, getting straight to the point. We did have a lot of questions in our mind and I believe the restaurant has a story to tell specially how the cuisine is \"indigenous\" a little romancing and background story would have been great so that right there was a bit lacking. We settled for the fish app and meat pate app to start elk entree for main. 
For the fish app- seal tartare, smoked trout and Beet cured smoked salmon, salmon was out so we got double trout. 
The seal was intriguing to eat since it was our first time having it, it has a very irony finish and a sharp onion flavour. That's pretty much the flavour profile of the dish. Not a fan but at least I could say I tried it. 

Smoked salmon trout was probably 1oz pcs, was good but super small for the plate. The dish was served with a toast cut in half 

Meat trio- elk rillette, rabbit liver , terrine. 
Elk rillette was good, jerk flavour a little dry but flavour was outstanding. 
Rabbit liver with truffle smooth and delicious
Terrine was a 5 animal terrine, was good too very fatty melts in your mouth. 
Served with a toast cut in half.

Ordered side toast since no way the toast they serve was enough. Its called bannock which was a dense white bread. Made in house. Good but not great. Oh this was $6 extra! I mean I just paid for a $22 & $18 appetizer, and you barely gave any toast with it.... c'mon!

We waited for our plates to get cleared for 20mins since no one really came to our table to check us out. 

Our elk entree came, our server explained it to be medium rare elk before ordering it but sadly it came well done covered in sauce. The elk was served with beets beans and Sunchokes, Sunchoke puree, a demi. This dish was really underwhelming charred and dried elk crust covered in demi, looking at other people's picture they had this beautiful red meat,  but not for us....
Who ever cooked our elk knew it was fucked up and covered the elk with sauce, such a sad way hiding a mistake. Not to mention the puree was cold, and the steak was cold too, being well done already I wonder how long the steak was sitting around.... embarrassing and chef didn't catch this?? $26 blogTO says elk was sous vide wow take a genius to get the medium rare to well done with a sous vide machine.... 

No one checked on us to see how things were so we didn't bother saying anything. We were done eating and didn't really want to continue on, but it took another 20 mins looking for service to come and trying to catch someone's attention. 

The whole dinner was dragging , service was horrible, food could have been good and the concept was great but the execution for tonights dinner was definitely not worth being in the top new restaurant for 2018. 

I wouldnt go back nor would I recommend this to anyone. My rating is not only for the food but for my whole dinner experience, including service and ambiance."}
