{"text":"I adore this place. Great owners, great vibe, cool decor, yummy nachos. Only thing I wish they'd address is the tragic wine menu. They do beer and cocktails really well, but the wine options leave you dry. Definitely worth going to though!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had a great experience. The atmosphere is nice and the decor is interesting. Drink prices are low as well. 

They have a fun selection of board games and this is a great place for a boozy double date. 

TIP: Order the mac and cheese. $13 and sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Great owners, great beer, awesome vibe. The authenticity of this place makes it a chill place for any day of the week."}
{"text":"New to area, thought I would try for quick drink and app. Simply amazing, sisters are wonderful, atmosphere is laid back, service and food are over the top. Will be back many times"}
{"text":"I go for the nachos and stay for the disappearing unicorns.   What the hell is a disappearing unicorn?  Drop by and find out. 

Casual atmosphere with no pretension and great gals who run the place.  If you're a woman, you can have a drink at the bar alone without being hit on.   That's gold kids."}
{"text":"We didn't have a chance to eat here but give it 4 stars for the atmosphere and ambience. The drinks menu has something for everyone. We came here as part of the craft beer passport but felt that it was a much better place for spirits. I'd return here just to have a cocktail in that atmosphere!"}
{"text":"In Toronto this past weekend for a show at the Opera House. We were looking for a place to nab a decent drink before the show. This fit the bill perfectly--hop and a skip from the venue. My girlfriend had a well-made cocktail. I had a cold pint of Lost Craft. We shared a flatbread with carmelized onions, mozz, goat cheese, sundried tomato pesto, and chicken. Sat at the bar and really enjoyed the place. It gives off a cool and cozy vibe. Drinks are delicious. The food was really, really good and the perfect size for a pre-concert nibble. It was crisp, but soft to bite into. Perfectly hot and full of flavor. Music was on point--Fleetwood Mac to Talking Heads. And the staff are incredibly friendly. It was quick and easy. Clean restroom. 

I wish we had a place like this back home--I'd be a regular for sure. 

I know they're pretty new and I really hope they get the traction to stick around. Next time I'm in town for a show, this place is on the list of must-visits."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party with a pretty large group. I have to say the service was quite slow. I got the dry rub jerk chicken legs and while they were pretty good, it definitely wasn't enough food. My girlfriend had the Mac and cheese and it also took quite a while for her to get her food as well, but it was pretty tasty. 

Nice selection of drinks here though, and pretty cool decor."}
{"text":"We had the \"Rock to the Ricotta\" Flatbread and \"Mad Mac\" Mac & Cheese (add bacon). Both were a-ma-zing! Hit all my tastebuds' erogenous zones.  Great service, atmosphere. Very casual, great music, not at all pretentious....but very fun and cool. Highly, highly recommend! Going to try the Ouija board next time"}
{"text":"I was meeting a few friends in Riverdale and this was the initial meeting spot. I had to say the name sort of threw me when I was told to meet there because it almost sounded like my friend was saying goodnight. 

I'll Be Seeing You (capitalized as it's a proper name) is on the south side of Queen East just about a block east of Broadview. There's a sign on the door about the place being started by two sisters and one dollar. I'd love to sit and learn the story behind the place. 

Sadly we only came to have a quick drink however in the short time spent in this local watering hole it was pretty evident that this place has charm in buckets.  

While the bar looked rather generously stocked the decor definitely had a female touch.  The most obvious display of that would be the really cool display of plates on the back wall. I've never seen something like that in a bar which makes this idea rather unique. 

Besides that the two sisters (I'm assuming they were the two serving us) were extremely friendly and accommodating. It always feels good when you feel welcomed in a place especially if it's your first time at a there. 

The vibe was good and although it would have been nice to stay we had to meet others elsewhere. We did however attempt to come back after we were done with dinner but unfortunately the place didn't have room at that time which on a Friday is understandable. 

There's a small selection of card games and board games at the front to choose from so if you really wanted to hang out at this place hey, grab a box and get into the groove. 

I'll Be Seeing You has fun music, a positive atmosphere, a comfortable space and friendly service all around at this place. 

(We'll) be seeing you again, soon."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

I stumbled upon this place by chance. I was early for my dinner reservation and decided to go look for a place to grab a quick drink and this place was just across the street. I had never noticed it even though I ride past it twice a day on the streetcar. 

They had four ciders available, all in a can (not a issue for me) and all Ontario craft ciders (YESSSS!). I sat at the bar and the bartender, who I believe is one of the owners, was really friendly and attentive. The whole vibe of the place felt warm and inviting. I definitely want to come back and have a meal here. 

TL;DR - 4 craft ciders, friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this bar! Also has Great food and drink selection at reasonable prices! 

I really enjoy their comedy night (and it's free)! They also have a selection of board games that you can use"}
{"text":"Made it in for the first time with the new owners and was really impressed. Drinks were unique and delicious, the food was tasty and reasonably priced and the service was wonderful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a weeknight and had some wine. They have specials such as tallboy Tuesdays, wine Wednesdays, etc. had $6 glasses of wine. Server was very friendly. Tried jerk chicken as well which was delicious and spicy (comes with 3 drumsticks). Would recommend. Street parking."}
{"text":"Stumbled across I'll be Seeing You when we aimed for Hi-Lo but they were closed tonight. A very very happy accident. Service was great, prices were reasonable and the food was amazing! Having a perfectly made order of wings was one thing, but to have them served with some of the best coleslaw I've ever had really blew my mind. I will be back and until then, I'll be telling all my friends about this gem."}
{"text":"While meeting a few friends for dinner, a few of us arrived early so we decided to check out this bar.  Honestly I fell in love just a bit!  Owned by 2 sisters and opened for about a year, this bar is fun and cute (cute in a grown up way not a little kid way!)

There are a few board games in the front, a Ouija board and a whole lot of amazing eclectic art all around.  It's small but cost.

The food menu (we just had drinks, no food) looks interesting with a good variety of food.  The cocktails all sound delicious.

I believe you can also make reservations because when we came back after dinner to chill with everyone 2 of the larger tables had reserved signs on them.

I think this is my new favorite place - the charm this place has and the fun I had here in a relatively short time I'd quite impressive.

Oh, I'll definitely be seeing you again!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the city. Natasha is a God damn rockstar and while I haven't had the pleasure of meeting her sister I am certain she is equally as badass. Mix the buttermilk with the hot honey sauce and swim down to flavourtown with one of the crisp IPA's they have on rotation. Hell. Yeah. 10/10 you'll be seeing me again. 

P.s. Bonus star goes to the menu, which challenges the patrons to have brains."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to give a 6 star review - because this place is just straight up amazing! I had my wife's surprise 30th birthday party here and Vanessa and Natasha (the owner/operators) made it unforgettable. The food was next level (some of the best fancy pub fare I've ever had) the drinks were perfect (they developed a signature cocktail for my wife) and the place was just the perfect setting for a big dinner for 25 or so people. 

We will for sure be back again and again - in a city where things come and go quickly, I hope I'll Be Seeing You sticks around for a long long tome. 

Simply put - stop reading this and just go there already!! It's the best!!"}
{"text":"I liked my meal at this charming, no-attitude comfort food restaurant and bar so much. We ordered the Mac & Cheese on a whim. It was exceptional. Our waitress told me they make it with a Béchamel sauce, keeping it smooth and rich. The selection of local wines was great, and I really liked the service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! Excellent date night spot - especially as they take reservations on Fridays/Saturdays."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a girls night. This cute and homey bar is owned by two super cool looking sisters. I immediately give props to them as they both work on the floor six days of the week. 

The bar includes a mix of vintage furniture, modern drinks, comfort food menu - there's definitely something for everyone. They also have a stack of old school board games available to play.  

We ordered the Ceasar salad, wings and Mac and cheese. I assumed the plates would be appetizer size but boy we're we wrong. The Ceasar salad was serving plate size and it was decent. The Mac and cheese came in a hot cast iron skillet. While the skillet looked small, that skillet was 2-3 inches deep. The macaroni could have been a little bit softer but that's more a personal preference, this was more al dente. The cheese was gooey, creamy and was a nice homemade dish. 

Now the wings... These are the best wings. They are baked but these taste fried so if you're worried about a lack of crunchy breading, no need to worry. The best part of the wings are the sauces! We got BBQ and Honey I'm Hot and it was a perfect blend of heat and sweetness. The coleslaw that came with the wings was really good as well. 

This is a great place to grab drinks with the girls and enjoy some shareable bites. It's refreshing to see a place like this thrive."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot - perfect for girls night or a first date. Love the cocktails (try the disappearing unicorn), decor and board games. Also owned by two sisters! Yes!"}
{"text":"Love this local bar. Funky decor, great drinks and snacks, interesting crowd of all ages and styles, and some boardgames in case you're feeling competitive. Like mixed drinks? Try the Disappearing Unicorn or the Margarita Mezcal."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people for a friend's birthday on Friday and the amazing Yelp reviews don't lie!

Beer:
Their beer selection was great. At least 10 or so different craft bottles/cans, 4 taps, and a rotating sour tap. All served in proper brewery glassware! I can't really speak to the rest of the alcohol menu as we are primarily beer drinkers.

Food:
The food was quite tasty. I had the potato wedges with bacon, sour cream, cheese and scallions. It was basically a whole potato sliced into wedges and covered with SO much stuff. I couldn't even finish them, to be honest. My fiancé had the meatballs which were delicious and followed those up with the jalapeno poppers which he said were quite good as well. The wings come with a basting brush so you can make them as saucy as you want.

Service:
Our server was great! Prompt, friendly, and managed to keep the bills of 12 people straight without any mix ups.

Atmosphere:
Super cute! The walls are plastered with eclectic photos and pieces of art, there's a super comfy old school vintage sofa, and a good selection of board games (Cards Against Humanity, Headbanz, Scrabble, Balderdash, to name a few) which were all in great shape and not missing any pieces, as far as I know.

Overall this place is quite a Leslieville gem and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good place for a casual night out with friends. Unpretentious and very reasonably priced! I came with a friend - we ordered a bottle of wine (they have great selections for only $35), the shrimp appetizer, meatballs, and jerk chicken. Shrimps were big and the dish is crunchy (comes with 3!); really nice start to the meal. Meatballs were good, but the real winner was the jerk chicken. It's really spicy and flavorful! They pair it with a lightly sauced slaw which complements it well. They no longer serve ice cream sandwiches for dessert which was a bummer, but we were pretty stuffed! All that and our bill only came to $40 each.

The owners, two sisters, are also the bartenders and servers; although the place is small we found they needed at least one more server to keep up. Also, as we were only a table for two, they put us by the door which kept opening and closing and made us a bit chilly. Wouldn't be the placement for a large group but I recommend eating at the bar if you're planning to go with 1 other person on a busy night. 

Ambiance was amazing and the music selection was spot on! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks and great food! What more can you ask?

We ordered their chicken wings with honey hot sauce, mad Mac, and sausage party.

Chicken wings - cooked perfectly, juicy and the honey hot sauce actually has a good kick. It's nice that the sauce came separately with a brush, so you can lather the sauce on the wings yourself. Highly recommend!

Mad Mac - pasta was cooked al dente with tons of yummy cheesy goodness. The top was baked with bread crumbs, so a nice play on texture. Add bacon for extra $3!

Sausage Party - German sausage, pretzel, sauerkraut, and potato salad. I love that the sausage had a great snap and not too salty. It paired really well with the grainy mustard. The potato salad and the sauerkraut were both good. The pretzel was nice and warm, although a bit too oily because of the butter. But overall I quite like the dish, I would order it if I was craving a smorgasbord!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Find this place with the cute neon sign out front. Came here before a show at the Opera House and it was such a good choice, can't wait to come back!

Drinks: 
They have an extensive beer list, with rotating specials. They also have a good variety of cocktails. I'm a wine drinker and they have a number of bottles available at great prices! ($35-$55). 

Food: 
A lot of great appetizers to share and a few mains. We had the nachos which were delicious. Can't wait to try the jalapeno poppers

Service & Ambiance: 
Amazing music, cool vibes and friendly service. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"We arrived here on a busy Saturday evening and only had a short wait for a table. Right from the moment we walked in the server went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. She was very tentative in making sure we knew about the wait time, drinks, and food. The cocktails were very delicious; I would recommend the disappear unicorn. We also got a spinach dip, which was also good. The place has very cute and cozy decor with antiques and old pictures lining the wall. I have already recommended this place to several people."}
