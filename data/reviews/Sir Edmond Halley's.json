{"text":"I went there today to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at lunchtime.   I was surprised to see a few items on their menu that seemed more Asian than Irish, but what the hey.  I choose the Rueben Sandwich--sounded like a safe bet.  What a disappointment--two undertoasted pieces of white bread with one piece of corned beef between and a spoonful of sauerkraut on top.  I was still hungry after I forked out 10 bucks for this appetizer sized lunch. 

I would have thought that since they would be drawing folks in that perhaps hadn't eaten there before (I have several times over the years) that they would want to put their best foot forward to garner some repeat business.  Based on what I saw, they favor quantity served vs. quality of food.

I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Thursday.

Place is located on the back lower level of the Park Road Shopping Center.

Felt like it was in a basement.  Not my cup of tea.

Ordered the classic Fish and Chips - it is supposed to be an English pub.  Was very disappointed that the crust on my fish was soggy - yuck!  Other menu items included pretty standard burgers and sandwiches along with some more exotic selections like ostrich meatloaf.  Desserts were almost non-existent - I tried the chocolate and peanut butter tarte - couldn't taste any peanut butter in it.  Skip dessert here.  Although one of my companions tried the chocolate pudding served to resemble a Guinness in a glass.

No one at our table ordered beer and we didn't get a beverage menu so I can't really comment on the beer and wine selection.

The food menu was interesting in that all items on it were priced at $8 each - would make it really easy to split a check if there with a group!

Patio seating looked very nice - wished we'd taken advantage of it!

The place gets an extra star from me because they appear to be very dog-friendly.  One patron had her furry friend with her on the patio (he was very well behaved and laid quietly at her feet) and someone had provided a large bowl of water for him.

Location could be difficult for someone with mobility problems - difficulty walking or in a wheelchair.  Seems like there are lots of elevation changes and an uneven floor in many spots.

Won't cringe if someone suggests it again - but won't rush to go back either."}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill out away from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

I usually go to Montford, but like to change it up at Sir Ed's from time to time.


Gotta get a Guiness when I go, how could you not?"}
{"text":"I recently noticed that Sir Edmond Halley's has  added a vegan version of their black bean veggie burger.  Hoo-ray for all the plant-eaters and serious props to Sir Ed's for giving a nod to modern lifestyles/diets.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hostess was awful, but the waitress was nice! It's dead here and the food was awful. Will not be back. Such a shame because the location is great!"}
{"text":"I love that this place reminds me of so many hole in the wall spots from home (totally a compliment I swear!). It's hard to find if you don't know where to look, which adds to its appeal. There a ton of vegetarian options, which can sometimes be hard to find around town. I had trouble deciding on exactly what to eat and will have to go back again and again to try everything I want. Make sure to sign up for their birthday list so you get a free entree every year. BTW - the flourless chocolate cake is mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite! It has gotten worse and worse every time I have gone here over the years. 

This last experience takes the cake. I ordered a hamburger with no mustard, no mayo, and cheddar cheese. It came out with swiss cheese (not a big deal,) but it also had mustard and mayo. I let the server know, and I must note that I was not mean or rude about it at all. Mistakes happen.

The burger came back moments later with cheddar cheese slapped on top of the swiss, and the mustard and mayo gone..... How does someone get mustard and mayo out of the nooks and crannies of a burger.....? By rinsing it with water, I presume. So the burger came back cold, slightly wet, cheddar cheese (not melted) on top of the old cheese. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. The server said nothing, even when he saw me not even take one bite. After approaching the manager, she took it off the bill. 

I am not saying that I need anything for free, but I did come there to eat, left hungrier than I arrived, and then STILL had to go through the chick-fil-a drive thru after paying $30 for 2 drinks and the meal of the other person at the table.

Never again."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and was pleased, they were busy and it took them awhile to get our drinks and orders, but they were nice and the food was actually very good this time. I may have to reconsider my former position! Oh, and if you give them your email, you get a free birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, It seems to that the key to enjoying Sir Ed's is NOT to order the Fish n Chips. The fantastic beer selection is one reason to keep coming back.  I had trouble deciding, and finally just closed my eyes and pointed to the page. The waitress was very good at asking for refills.  We ate outside on the patio, which has a great atmosphere, and despite being busy, was very intimate and quiet. We went with another couple, both of whom had the Fish n Chips.  They both enjoyed them, and I think both are experienced Fish n Chippers, so that says a lot, especially since they are also \"foodies\".   

We started the table with french fries with the curry dipping sauce, which is REALLY delicious!!  So delicious, in fact, that my husband nearly bit our waitresses hand off when she tried to take it before he had scraped it all out!  

My husband had the shaved leg of lamb wrap.  He raved about it, oohing and aahing through the whole meal.  As a fan of lamb in general, I am sure I would have loved it too, had be bothered to share a bite with me!  

I had the Roasted Artichoke, Zucchini & Garlic sandwich.  It was also really fantastic. The bread was still crispy, even with the roasted veggies on it soaking the bread with deliciousness!  There's not too much more to say about it--it was just a good sandwich that definitely satisfied this customer. 

I am definitely interested in trying the Ostrich meatloaf and kangaroo loin--how cool does that sound??  They have a very eclectic menu, while still retaining a \"pub feel\".  

I would definitely recommend sitting outside if it's nice, since the inside is a bit dingy and dark--not really my cup of tea.  We will definitely be coming back here, even if it is just to enjoy a pint outside with friends."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. The staff is friendly, the beer is cold and the Jamacian Jerk Chicken Nachos are PHENOMEONAL. This is a local little hidden gem in the Southpark area that is relaxing and not pretentious. It has a feel of the wonderful European pubs. Don't miss a chance to sit outside and enjoy the weather on a hot summer day with a cold beer and did I mention the Jamacian Jerk Chicken Nachos?!

For Sam J who feels the need to criticize other people's reviews and their grammer, get a life, some people take this too seriously!"}
{"text":"The patio is nice! If you are looking for a cozy place to go sit outside that isn't next to a busy street, this is a good place to go. They do not allow cigar smoking until after 10 o'clock PM though, (even outside) so if you are looking for a place to enjoy a cigar, keep that in mind. The menu is unusual with a variety of different fares like goat cheese friiters, Buffalo chili and Ahi Tuna. I had the fritters and a plate of Ostrich tacos. The fritters were interesting (quite rich though) and I would have them again, but they were \"missing something\". I felt that way about the tacos as well but quickly rectified that with the addition of the garlic chili paste. The garlic chili paste turned the *okay*  tacos into something spectacular! I will eat there again, but will mostly be going for the on draught Hobgoblin Ale and the patio. (they have draught Belhaven and some other quality European beers as well) I have read mixed reviews about the service there but would have to say that my experience was excellent. The staff was welcoming, informed about the menu and took time to see that I was a happy customer. I went on a Tuesday night, that may have somethig to do with it. Pricing was a little high (38 dollars for Ostrich tacos, goat cheese fritters, and three pints of Hobgoblin) but that was not surprising to me since it isn't your typical \"bar food\" and Bud.  I will definitely go there again simply because I liked the place and the people, but I see it more as a cool bar/patio than a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere and food  We had fish and chips and Guinness stew. Both meals good  only complaint thought a bit overpriced for what you got. Would go back."}
{"text":"Love the Lemon Chicken. It is seldom filled when I'm there, so it is very relaxing. Great service!"}
{"text":"This place wins on two things for me:
- Outdoor seating atmosphere.  The patio is like a nice tucked away English garden that can make you forget where you are.
- Food - we had a special (blackened scallops) that was way, way tasty versus \"bar food\" and an excellent value.

Beer in proper Imperial pints always works for me, too.  I'm easy that way.

The vibe here actually reminded me several places near where I once lived in London, and many of the complaints in less favorable reviews... only bolstered that impression!"}
{"text":"Service was average, nothing exciting about it! We stopped for appetizers and whiskey. The Irish potatoes cakes and the goat cheese fritters... mind-blowing! 

Really a great flavor, crispy, cheesy and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Soo glad they have reopened!! Was always one of my favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tucked away, great food, legit English food, good beer, quite with a nice porch when it is warm enough"}
{"text":"I love this place, couldn't be happier that it re-opened. Nice chilled out pub atmosphere with great food served well into the night. No crappy bar food here."}
{"text":"Menu consists of a pretty unique twist on typical Irish pub fare.  Quinoa burger, zucchini cake, broccoli Parmesan sandwich - everything was tasty.  The menu was really eclectic, and there were plenty of vegetarian options.  Enjoyed the random music - Coolio, Journey, Beatles.  Service was friendly.
Try the Guineas pudding.  It's the richest chocolate pudding ever.  It comes in a mini Guinness glass, and even 6 of us couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Sir Edmond Halley's has been our neighborhood \"sure thing\" for a great meal for years. The fish and chips, bacon cheeseburger, bean quesadillas, and spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts with a Speckled Hen beer are all satisfying. Oh yes, I forgot about the apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The staff is always friendly, and available. A great place to enjoy a relaxing meal whether indoors or in the patio."}
{"text":"The primary reason I like Sir Edmond Halley's is that it feels like a secret.  I like how there is a little tudor facade built into the back of a shopping center.  Inside you'll find a low ceilinged space with few windows and a large wooden bar.  Feels cozy!  I didn't try the food, but sat at the bar and had no issue getting drinks and refills.  They had a great looking space reserved outdoors but it was too cold to utilize it.  I'm excited to go back and check out this beer garden."}
{"text":"A small English pub tucked away in  an alley behind harris teeter.  They have a huge outdoor eating area.  The inside has a large community table in the back for when the restaurant gets crowded.  They have an extensive beer selection.  As far as the food goes you have to be very careful.  I have tried many things on the menu and I have only been impressed by the bacon cheeseburger and the fish and chips.  But, the bacon cheeseburger is the best you'll get anywhere.  The food is also very affordable."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Charlotte... savory and truly without the need of tartar sauce or vinegar... or ketchup. (They have all that, and it is good, but not needed) But come hungry, portions are good size. I almost rated it a \"4\" at first, due solely to the price point, but after tasting their food... and watching them build a perfect pint of Guinness - head rising proud of the rim, built in two parts, and the cascade proving they have their gases mixed properly... It gets a 5. It is a bit of a drive from my house, but I'll be making it. Probably weekly...Maybe on Mondays for Trivia night?"}
{"text":"It's hard to find bars with excellent food, but Sir Ed's does it. The traditional food is terrific-like the fish and chips--but the specials, like the bolognese, were delish as well. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Been there before and enjoyed it.  However, before it changed management/ owner I used to get the fish and chips..... NEVER AGAIN!  The fish came out as a tube of bread with a tiny center of fish inside.  The ratio was about 70% bread (sweet tasting, too?!?) to about 30% WET white fish.  I ate one and1/2 bites and would have been sick if I ate the rest.  Fries were ok, but that's not what I get fish and chips for....  Lunch partner had BLT that had about a cup of mayo on it, so ask for it on the side.  Her tomato soup (used to be her favorite in CLT) was salty and not a lot of  tomato flavor.  

I've had good stuff there, but not great.  I'll suggest to the new owners to buy the recipes from the old/previous owners.... 

I was surprised that the waitress asked me if I wanted a box for the 'fish' and got a resounding NO.  She could see I only ate about a bite or two.... but didn't ask if there was a problem.  Anyway, if I go back, I'm not sure what to order.  

Another lunch partner had a mixed green salad with salmon on it.... he loved it.  Not my kind of lunch though."}
{"text":"Another reviewer wrote that one of Sir Ed's disadvantages is its hard-to-find nature, but I think that's one of the many qualities that make it a hidden gem of Charlotte. A batch of friends and I have only recently started attending on the semi-regular, a few times for Monday night trivia, and on another occasion just to sit and grab a drink and some food. Each time, we've had a blast.

The atmosphere is quiet and friendly, which is an extremely welcome change to some of the other bars we've frequented.  We call it our neighborhood 'Cheers', since it feels like the kind of place you can easily become a welcome regular, where the staff will remember you, and treat you well regardless of what you're ordering. Service has always been good - a few minor delays once in a while on busy trivia nights, but totally understandable. 

The food is very, very acceptable. It is largely comprised of bar grub, but it's done well; no, it's likely not going to be comparable to a dining establishment whose focus is solely food - but they have a surprisingly extensive menu (another Yelper complained about a lack of menu options, which I think is untrue) featuring lots of share-worthy appys, a wide variety of burgers and sandwiches, and some surprising main dishes including Chicken Curry (I can't directly comment, but a friend got the curry sauce with a basket of fries, and said it was awesome.), among other more predictable choices like Fish & Chips and Shepherd's Pie. Friends have enjoyed their Chicken Tender baskets, which come with their thick-cut steak fries (which are delicious). Another friend's side salads have featured an impressive diversity of greens and fresh-looking toppings; definitely not one of those substandard iceberg mixes that some places try to get away with. My Turkey Burger was flavor-balanced well with its herbed goat cheese and sliced apple toppings, and was a good size - not overwhelmingly big such that I felt like food was my personal enemy after consuming it (Bad Daddy's, I'm looking at you). Husband was also impressed with his Blackened Cod taco plate, which I did not try, but looked nicely put-together. Another friend said the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer was good, but a little skimpy in comparison to some other orders, and would be better rounded out by a side of fries (as comes with the Chicken Tenders). Vegetarians, fear not! They have at least a few veggie options that aren't completely boring for you to choose from, too.

They pour a generous pint, and have a variety of size options for you to mix and match how much you're in the mood to drink that evening - half pint's, \"American\" pints, English pints, and more. If you're not in the mood for harder stuff, soda refills come fast and furious.

Re: trivia, so far theirs is the best we've found in Charlotte. They're not part of a big nation-wide group like the Team Trivia at Jackalope Jack's, but we like their setup better; a Charlotte entertainment group, \"Merely Players\", puts it on, and every Monday on their Facebook page they list 3 topics from the upcoming evening's 7 rounds, so you can get in a little on-point cramming before you get there. We tried to visit Ed's Tavern on a Thursday night to compare the trivia there, but were chased away by the headache-inducing music, overall noisy atmosphere and lack of open seating.

Sir Edmond's is a recently-discovered jewel to us and our friends, and we only feel sad that we had not tried it sooner. It's quickly become part of our weekly repertoire in Charlotte, and hopefully will continue to be so for many years to come."}
{"text":"Wayyyy overpriced for the quality of food. And very small selection to choose from. Best thing I had was the fries, and that's just sad for that to be the case. The Shepard's pie was not that tasty. Kind of tasted frozen and heated up to serve. Wish I would have stuck with the flying biscuit instead of trying to venture over to a new place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cute and laid back in here, and they have a pretty good local beer selection (OM & NoDa beers on tap).

The food leaves room for improvement- or many it was just what we ordered as our friends seemed to enjoy their meals.  I got the fish tacos which were SO spicy I couldn't eat them.  I love spicy food, but this was really overkill.  It was inedible and I literally couldn't taste any of the flavors because of the overwhelming spice on the fish.  My husband got a burger that was charred.  We both didn't finish our meals.

Apparently the Shepard's Pie was good according to our friends, but I didn't try it, so I can't say for sure.  I would definitely be careful what you order though."}
{"text":"You know I have tried to like Sir Edmond's, I really have.  I've gone there a bunch of times, and I really like the outdoor patio seating, especially the big cherry tree that has such beautiful blossoms in the spring and would be the perfect place to take a chick on a first or second date, and they do have a descent selection of brew on draught, I do like Ye Old Speckled Hen, but well, their food sucks.  The last time I went there I ordered the fish and chips, mainly cause this is a pub and I was feeling nostalgic for my days in London, so I wanted some fish and chips, and thought they might actually be good...Wrong!  The fish and the batter were uncooked, and I had to send it back not once, not twice, not three times, but four times, and on the last time, it still wasn't right I just didn't feel like sitting there anymore, and my brother had already finished his burger, which did look good.  Did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble, nope.  Which brings me to my next complaint, the service and the whole atmosphere is really kind of rude, and stuffy, maybe I'm just not cool enough, but they always seem to busy to serve me, and the whole low ceiling basement bar thing is not my bag.  Other people love Sir Edmond's, I know I've heard rave reviews for their burgers and their lamb sandwich, this place just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's is a little hidden gem in Park Road Shopping Center that not nearly enough people know about. 

Inside, the low ceiling and dark accents give this place a total Irish Pub feel. Outside, the patio seating is a nice little quiet sanctuary.

The menu here is very vegetarian friendly with lots of comfort food to choose from. Sir Ed's has a large bar with lots of beers and and an adequate on tap selection.

My favorite appetizer here is the Irish Potato Cakes ($6.50). Two large crusty cakes with a warm herb goat cheese sauce. Delish! 

I usually order the Spicy Asparagus & Portabella Grilled Cheese ($8.25).  This sammich is served on sourdough. It's a nice change from your typical grilled cheese. The veggies inside are perfect, but I wouldn't exactly call them spicy. Order comes with a side, I almost always get the french fries... large \"steak fries\" with a strong potato flavor."}
{"text":"This place had great veggie options, food was delicious overall. They have rather limited options for beer on tap, kind of expected more from a pub in that respect but again food is delicious. Sound doesn't carry well at all so expect to shout to your friends. It gets loud really easy so don't go on a first date."}
{"text":"I have been to Sir Edmond Halley's on a few occasions & I have had terrible service every single time.  The first time we got our first round swifty but waited over an hour for our second round.  The second time we waited 45 minutes to even get served & then another hour and half to get a second round.  The food is mediocre at best, tasteless & bland even for British food.  The only thing it has going for it is location -- you can get a decent pint & \"pub grub\" without the hassle of going uptown."}
{"text":"My family has trouble picking places to eat because we have 3 picky kids and one vegetarian. This place has the perfect variety for everyone! The vegetarian options are very good!"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend the other night.  Had the wings.  They were good and cooked to perfection with a little char on the outside.  Friend had the potato cakes and they were delicious she said.  Service was an A+.  Should remain a very cool spot until the transplants and Yankees find out about it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Charlotte spots. My favorite Bacon Cheeseburger in town with an actual hand made Patty with amazing flavor. This burger with huge steak fries(and malt vinegar) and a pint of beer on their brick patio in the spring or fall is one of my favorite places to be in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love love love this Hidden Gem!!! Hits the spot every time!  Best Grilled wings I've had at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"How this place has managed to stay open so long is an eternal mystery to me!  The food has always been mediocre.  The service was not even that good.  But somehow it endures.  Guess that explains how Dubya got reelected!"}
{"text":"Don't know about the food, so I marked it as 3, to test later if I can get past the smell. . . 

This is located at the back side of park shopping center. Centrally located between the shops, down some stairs and they have inside and outside seating. Being winter, I checked out the inside for the first time.   

Walked in wanting to try some goodness, so excited from the pictures. As soon as you walk in, it's darkly lite, and has a hole in the wall bar like feeling about it. I was going to sit down, but the smell of the place was dingy, and something I still can't put my finger on. This kept me from continuing past the lady that was vacuuming the floor and said I could have a seat anywhere. 

Will hopefully try walking in another time to make sure it wasn't just a fluke bad smelling time."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for fish and chips so we checked out Yelp.  This place was close and had good reviews so we decided to check it out.  Kids loved the chicken tenders and fish and chips.  My wife and I split a plate of fish and chips because we had no idea how much to expect.  We both could have had our own portion but splitting it was plenty since we were taking the kids for ice cream after.  Excellent fish.  Really hit the spot.  Stop in and check them out.  A little hard to find down the alley but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I wasn't surprised to read some of the bad reviews for this joint. You really gotta be in the mood to be neglected if you sit inside. Thankfully for me I know the bartender and always get prompt service. I like the dart boards and the comfy, group friendly seating in the back room. And the patio is awesome for those wonderful Carolina summer eves. I don't know if they still do it but they used to do sushi on Monday nights and everything on that menu was bad-ass! All-in-all I like the place. Good to be a regular though."}
{"text":"Ed's is a Charlotte Classic. Or should I say 'was?' Used to love this place but to say it has slipped downhill would be kind. $40 bucks for some wings drowning in a puddle of cold stale buffalo sauce, along with a bowl of Shepherd's Pie = rip off. Server could not have possibly cared less if we were there, or not. I would still visit for a beer but have dinner or a meal before you go. Since we were only one of two tables, looks like most Charlotteans have figured it out."}
{"text":"No beer specials on Saturday night!  I should have known it was going to be a bad evening when we were greeted with an offer for vodka shooters.  Thoroughly confusing introduction to what's supposed to be a well-loved English pub.  Seeing as there were only six customers inside but the patio was packed, the best reason to go is to enjoy a draught Guiness in the outdoor seating.  

I wanted food and word on the street is they're under new management and reinstated their traditional menu.  So I hankered to try their shepherd's pie.  The online menu is not current and meat pie is nowhere to be seen.  

The new menu has things like egg rolls with spicy sauce.  If they are trying to cook what the new chef is good at, they're still missed the mark.  The new items are mediocre at best.  It doesn't take Gordon Ramsay to know they should throw the new menu out the window and get back to English basics.  

Don't get the burger if you're used to Big Daddy's or The Burger Co!  The patty and fries tasted pre-fab frozen.  Definitely had bad tummy the rest of the evening.  The whiskey selection is next to nil.  If friends want to go again I'll try the fish and chips but I won't get my hopes up.  And I wouldn't call it an English restaurant anymore or even a \"pub\" judging the current state of affairs."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Sir Edmond Halley's sure it's changed a little bit the food isn't quite as good but they have a decent beer selection and make good drinks.  The service is friendly and I had a delicious veggie sandwich.  They had quite a few healthy options on the menu and that will keep bringing me back.  It's always nice to go to a pub & have options besides cheeseburgers, wings, & french fries.  However if that is what your looking for dig in they have plenty of typical pub food on the menu.  
This is a great place to come and meet some friends for drinks or grab a quick bite to eat before a movie.  It's a little hidden - your best option is to park behind park road shopping center."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's: 

Have to say I was there the first night they opened their doors and have been returning ever since. It has the best of many worlds, go early enough, it is a great Restaurant with a \"different\" menu than what you would expect (You have to try the Ostrich Meatloaf!). 

Go a little later in the evening, it is the classic \"pub\". I enjoy them both. 

I have been to restaurants and pubs all over Europe and the USA.  Sir Ed's ranks right up there with the best of them.

It is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening. 

Draft selection is great, a true bonus if you like English beer! (and Guinness!) I have always found the staff to be outstanding..Over the years, they have had a couple that were not up to the task but thankfully they did not last. 

Bar Staff is always wonderful and accommodating and over the years have become friends. Great place to go!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was a miss.  Fish and chips were way too doughy with no flavor.  However, I went again recently and tried some cuban pesto sandwich (don't remember the exact name).  It was great so I would definitely go back.  Side note:  you must like the smoky atmosphere and general beer smell otherwise the patio is available."}
{"text":"I had the absolute worst experience here yesterday when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. The waitress could not have been any more rude. I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress. 

One of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, \"How about I fix his fries first before they get cold?!\" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, \"Next time you want cheese, tell me!\" Our entire group was speechless.

I have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place."}
{"text":"Comfortable spot, good food. May not appeal to the hipster crowd, but I'm always happy if I find myself here. One fault, needs more local beers."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's always delivers.  I got there in the middle of trivia but I was able to get a spot at the bar.  I finally ordered the fish and chips and washed it down with a Port City Porter.  

The only thing really working against this place is how it's so hidden.  There are signs on the front side of the shopping center, but I didn't feel like navigating stairs and my friend was having problems finding me."}
{"text":"You must try the potato cake appetizer! Comes with a yummy goat cheese cream sauce that makes me want to lick the plate clean! Sir Edmund's has a cozy hole-in-the-wall atmosphere and great food. My husband loves the fish and chips and I love everything I've tried there. It's not exactly a cheap date, but the quality of service and food makes it worth it. I've never ordered anything complicated from the bar, we usually stick to draft beers unless it's half price wine night!"}
{"text":"I won't review the food as there really isn't much I would eat on the menu. The burger was ok, at best. We went for the pub quiz (Mondays at 7pm) and were pleasantly surprised. You never know what type of service or company you'll end up with around a pub quiz. This was a ton of fun. The servers and bar tender are totally into it and are jovial while not ignoring their guests. We were seated at the bar and the bar tender had no problem answering questions and making recommendations while also cracking jokes to the trivia. The crowd (apparently thick tonight due to the 2hr delay tomorrow from the arctic vortex), was jovial and good spirited. Everyone cracked jokes, cheered, and made small talk if not entire conversations. There are 4-5 rounds to the trivia and the topics range from history to music to movies to pictures - a little something for everyone to flex their muscles. We will definitely be making trivia night here more of a regular thing (even if I pre-game dinner and just do dessert)."}
{"text":"YEAH!!!  We found a \"neighborhood\" spot to hang out in that is comfortable, has great food (including quite a few tempting vegetarian selections for Dave) and has a good selection of beers and frequent pint specials (love me some Harps!)

It's a great little pub with simply one of the prettiest outdoor dining areas I've been in.  Service is friendly and efficient, food is darn tasty with options ranging from English pub fare (Shepherd's Pie) to Southern Specialties (Chicken Fried Chicken).  They have small plates that are really tempting and at least five options for my poor beleaguered vegetarian husband (whom I seem to always be dragging to restaurants that put meat in everything!)"}
{"text":"I have to wonder if the management has changed at Sir Edmunds.  I visited here with my fiancée last night after about 3 years away.  The atmosphere was still charming and pub-like.  The menu was still an intriguing mix of traditional Irish fair and unique dishes like locally sourced ostrich and butternut squash croquettes.  We could not tell if our apps were frozen out of a box, but wondered.  The \"Brie Fondue\" was like watered down thousand island dressing, only with less flavor.  The Roasted Beet Soup seemed like nothing more than beets put into a blender, no seasoning to bring out the smokey sweetness roasted beets have. The entrees were better; Enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  Based purely on food quality the rating would have been average... But for $60, the value factor drops it to a poor.

It saddened me because this place was a gem.  Hopefully, it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's is a spur of the moment, drop-in place that fills your tummy and quenches your thirst.    I've dropped in many times.   They do pub food very well and since it hearkens back to Ireland, expect bangers-n-mash, meatloaf, fish-n-chips, shepherd's pie along with other traditional good grub.

Now . . . it is not swanky, upscale, or pretentious.  Nor expensive.  In the pub category they rise above many joints simply because they deliver on the food and service.  My Haley's burger was well prepared and juicy, with sea salt sprinkled on the wedge potato fries.  Mmmm . . . so good.  And, gone, too!

Wanna laid back place to hang with friends without all the hoopla?  I say Give Sir Ed's a Whirl."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Best atmosophere in Charlotte. A true local tradition. Make sure to stop in for a pint."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not in any way familiar with the Charlotte bar scene, but this seemed like a pretty cool place upon first impression. I think what made it even better was that my hip(-ster), musical, \"cool\" (in the truest sense of the word) cousin in Charlotte suggested we meet there for a drink while I was in town for the night. The fact that this place has his approval is not to be taken lightly.

Okay, so here's the deal. Our party of four sat at a table and just ordered drinks. I don't think that is a particularly big deal, but our waitress made multiple references to this fact, and expressed her displeasure. I mean, sure, a bigger total means a bigger tip, but ordering multiple drinks is just as good in my book. I didn't appreciate how her parting words were \"Y'all promise to order some food next time, right?\" -- not the way to win customers' hearts. 

I liked that this was off the beaten path (or at least it felt that way, we had enough trouble finding it). I think that adds to its appeal. So, all in all, I think it's a \"cool\" place to grab a drink but nothing I would necessarily seek out."}
{"text":"Love it. Food is good, bar staff is lovely, servers are pleasant. Dog friendly patio, doggie water, very nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed!  Seriously this place is tucked away behind the park rd shopping center in the montford area.  An english style pub with an awesome selection of beer. The inside is dank and dark ( for some reason i kinda like it). The outside patio is awesome to sit on a nice day and have some grub.  They were out of th eostrich  lasagna so I opted for the new york strip.  I ordered it Medium Rare and it came out Rare.  That is completely fine with me, but might put off some people.  It came with some sort of potato cake that was just awesome.  The only problem I had was the strip I had was not the best cut of beef.  I guess though for $18 i really shouldn't complain especially about the size. I will be back at this little gem in clt"}
{"text":"People have to remember that this is a pub!! Also it's technically an English pub not Irish... My best friend and I have been coming here for years and YEARS, like years before smoking was banned.  This is our go to spot for catching up, relaxing, girl talk, game nights, etc. We don't come as often as we used to but when we do they still remember who we are which is awesome. They also have one of the best patios around. It's beautiful, cozy, and comfortable. The waitstaff and the bartenders always do an amazing job for us and coming here is always good.

Okay so on to the food... I've tried practically everything on the menu at one point or another and they will update their menus frequently to bring back some of our favorites. I came the other day with a friend and found the buffalo sloppy joe was back. I took a picture and sent it to the BFF as it's her favorite. Needless to say a few days later she and I took an after work trip to Sir Ed's!!

Some of my favorites include: jabari wings; Thai beef wontons; hong kong egg rolls; potato cakes; jamaican jerk chicken nachos; tomato soup; BLT; Shepards Pie; Ostrich Meatloaf; black bean veggie burger; and of course the bacon cheeseburger. They've had some other things over the course of the years that have been good as well. Their fries are great and the ranch dressing is addictive. *Thai beef wontons are seasonal and not on the menu currently*  Their fish and chips have never been very good nor have their chicken fingers. No one I know who has had either has like those dishes, pretty much always over cooked and just something about them isn't good.  The Guinness stew is sometimes great and sometimes not so great. I know I love this place and the people here but have to be honest about the food lol. 

Their beer selection is great and their wine selection is pretty good too. So if you're looking for a cozy English pub atmosphere with some interesting food choices that's out of the way of the hustle and bustle then this is definitely the place for you!!."}
{"text":"I forgot how awesome the food is here. I love that there is always something new in the menu and my favs are always here. Like the tomato soup is the most amazing soup!  I like that its hidden and how magical the patio is at night during spring time!"}
{"text":"Was here yesterday afternoon for a luncheon. This restaurant is hidden away. The only landmark if you are at the Park Row Shopping Center- is to look out for Ski Country Sports. Right before there is an alley way that will lead you down flight of stairs to Sir Edmond Halley's. They are nestled in the back of the shopping mall. 

I feel like walking into Cheers. It's just warm and inviting. Staff are attentive and provide great service. Just ask and they will provide. 

Ordered the fish and chips- Delicious! Love the breading of the fish. Stayed afterwards for their 1/2 price on bottle of wine special.

Will be back again to get the salmon salad. That looked yummy."}
{"text":"Will never return. Rudest bartender and staff I have encountered. Ordered take out for lunch on St. Patty's day and it was obviously inconvenient for them. Menu wasn't available online only last year's.  When I came to pick my order up it wasn't even busy..... Very overpriced and extremely small portions....."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's is like an old friend. Its comfortable, drinks are fairly priced and gigantic and I always forget how good the food is. Not sure how the last two relate to friendship but go with me on this one.

Driving behind Park Road Shopping Center can be a little unsettling but like I told my dinner companions its worth the trip.

Try any of the specials or the always sensational grilled cheese, shepherds pie or any other of the pub-ish offerings. The TV's are large the crowd isn't too loud and its a foodie's take on pub food."}
{"text":"I've only tried their lunch menu, apparently their full menu is available after 5pm until 2am. I ordered the vegetable club and my husband tried their black bean burger. Both of our meals were delicious and we'll be back again for sure. The restaurant was a little hard to find, and they had a very cool 80's/New Wave playlist (I got really excited to hear several tracks by The Cure)."}
{"text":"Most people would think a pub would be a bit stuffy and serve exclusively fried food, but Sir Ed's really breaks the mold!
Tucked behind the Harris Teeter in Park Road Shopping center, this place is really a treat! They have a very diverse menu that includes several vegetarian entrees. My personal favorite is the zucchini cake with ratatouille. It hits the spot and keeps you full without feeling ver indulgent. My friends usually order the ostrich meatloaf, but it is a bit much for me. 
The bar is always a hit, with surprising local beer choices on tap along with the usual suspects like Guinness.
Sir Ed's also sports a nice patio for mild days and a dart board in the back for play time."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish and chips i have ever had. I would definitely recommend sitting in the patio."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident with my friends when we were trying to hunt down the speakeasy behind Park Road shopping center. We stopped in for a drink and decided to sit on the patio. The patio was super cute at night- music playing, Christmas lights in the trees and an array of different customers. 

Inside of Sir Edmonds is a true Irish Bar. From to the decor to even the smell it reminded me of a little pub in London. The bartenders were nice and made sure to greet us upon entering the pub. 

I didn't try any food, but I would love to try it out and enjoy the patio. The inside was a little too muggy for me, but the patio area is nice and open with plenty of seating!"}
{"text":"Good gosh this place is hard to find! It's literally tucked away in the back of the shopping center! I don't even know how people would find this place without yelp and a gps.

The decor is quite classic English pub style and the service is charming. Sadly I find the food here a bit lacking after having been here twice. The first time I had the fish and chips which were good if a bit boring. The fries weren't as crisp as I would like and under seasoned. The fish batter on the other hand was delightfully crispy but also lacking some flavor. Salt is your friend! My second time here I had the Guinness stew, maybe my palate is not very good but it just tasted like canned beef stew to me. The best part of the dish were the vegetables on top of it. On the plus side drinks are cheap, and the patrons are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is touted as having the feel of an authentic British pub, but I've really only experienced the patio area, which is quite nice.

I can't speak to the food, as I was only there to drink and meet a few people, but I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.

The service, unlike a few other reviews have stated, was pretty decent. I don't recall waiting an inordinant amount of time for another beer or a time where I felt like I was being ignored.

The interior seems a bit small, but it had a nice feel to it. There was a duo playing bluesy covers and a few jazz tunes, but the patio is the place for me.

Nice place to go if you have a group or just a few friends to catch up with."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's is a Charlotte institution that still is an unknown to a lot of people.  Hidden in the back of Park Road Shopping Center, it can be hard to find - but, that should be changing as the back area is expanding to accommodate Amelie's and Midwood Smokehouse.  

If the weather is nice, you can enjoy the patio that is surrounded by trees and plants with lights strung in the trees to create a festive atmosphere.  Inside, Sir Ed's looks like your traditional irish pub - dimly lit with dark wood.  

Their beer selection is not huge, but always includes a cider on tap and guiness.  They also have a larger than most selection of wines by the glass - though you won't find any deals here with glasses starting at $7.50.   

The menu is where Sir Ed's really shines.  They have a nice selection of appetizers, sandwiches and entrees.  A couple that really stand out - the jerk chicken quesadilla appetizer (i know, not irish) is one of my favorite options, the wedge salad is also quite good.  I also like their fish and chips, fries with curry sauce, asparagus and portabello grilled cheese, and tomato soup.  The only dish I consistently don't care for is their curry chicken - it's just a bit watery and bland.  

Sir Ed's offers a free birthday dinner the week of your birthday - visit their website to sign up for this great offer.  

Every Monday is trivia night - beware, this is not a pop culture trivia night!  There are seven rounds of questions - each round has a theme.  There's always one music round and one picture round - leaving 5 more rounds to challenge you and your teammates."}
{"text":"I like this place, but the service is typically bad, so I have to give it three stars.  It gets positive points because they serve draft beers in a variety of sizes, the menu is awesome, and they serve food late.  Unfortunately, it can take an hour to get your food, and more than once I havent gotten what i ordered."}
{"text":"Sir Edmond BLAND's is what it should be called.... food was all bland, Sauerkraut was bland, potatoes were bland, Corned Beef was bland. It was all around bland."}
{"text":"Finally got to back back since they reopened.  I liked the outdoor seating area but decided to hang inside at the bar and get a black and tan.  Seems like the old place - just smells a little better and the food is good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best place in town to go grab a beer and have incredible food. The staff is incredible also. Need to go here more. Burger is out of this world"}
{"text":"So, service is pretty good. BBQ Cali is awesome.

However, tonight I ordered their reuben, veganized... which they offer on their menu. I ended up without sauce and cheese. That was okay with me. I thought they will compensate by giving me a decent amount of the two ingredients left (portobello and sauerkraut)... nope. I couldn't even tell there was sauerkraut on it and there was a one sliver of portobello, legit. My boyfriend and his friend (who ordered dishes with meat) had a sufficient meal. I don't get the disconnect. I can't believe they weren't ashamed bringing that out to me.

This place was a go to, now it's gonna be a big no to. Sorry... if a restaurant doesn't respect that I'm spending my hard earned money on their food then they don't deserve my money."}
{"text":"Used to go quite a bit but in the last few years the food has really gone South. Atmosphere is cool but on more than one occasion we have witnessed the cook staff fighting with mgmt. in the dining room. It seems to change hands quite a bit so I may go back and try it again. I can highly recommend the Guinness pudding though-good stuff!!

Also, it's pretty pricey for the quality and portions you get."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt one Sunday afternoon for lunch (don't open until like 5 on Sunday), we finally made it to Sir Edmond Halley's. It is tucked down below the Park Road shopping complex and can be accessed via that street as well. 

For lunch, they have a two tier pricing system. A group of lunches for $8 that includes a drink and tax or a selection for $10 including drink and taxes. That works for me. i went for the ostrich meatloaf that came with veggies and mashed potatoes. It was good, not great, it was almost a little bland for my taste. However, i am a fan of what my wife ordered off the $8 list. The Broccoli Parmesan was terrific. Based on the server's recommendation, she got the tomato soup with it and it was a terrific combo. Dip that baby in the tomato soup and enjoy. 

i did not consume any beers at this meal, but they had a few i would've liked to enjoy. Sadly, the drink included with lunch is not a Guinness, i double checked."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars on this visit if I could sadly. My friend looked up online for dog friendly restaurants and we were both excited that Sir Eds popped up pretty high on the list.  We had both eaten there numerous times and forgotten about it because we live in uptown. We arrived at 2:30 my friend went inside to request a table for two on the patio explaining we had a dog. The staff member working said that she was not serving the patio. We were confused because there was not one customer in the whole place. I went inside to ask the hours of the patio.  She replied it is the same as the dining room????? We both have been in the restaurant business for over 20 years.  I just really don't understand how this level of service can happen.  Would really love to experience their amazing food again but after this customer service experience its definitely not worth going out of our way with so many closer options."}
{"text":"Don't order the Shepherd's Pie if your hungry.. It's as small as a soup and it over 15$... Came starving and left hungry.... I'm on my way out now and guess what I'm hungry enough to stop somewhere for dinner. Not impressed or coming back."}
{"text":"This house hidden dungeon off of Park Road is where my team decided to have our holiday luncheon. It took me a while to find it since it was my 1st visit. This is a true pub. Dark and dingy. The menu offered many different options from ostrich meatloaf to fried cauliflower to chicken fingers. I went with the chicken but my colleagues ventured out. Service was quick and my food was decent. My colleagues also seemed to enjoy their food. Overall, this place ( IMO) is just ok."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite watering hole in Charlotte! The food is a always solid, and a cut above your average bar food (lots of vegetarian options, too, if you swing that way) . They have a good selection of beers, once almost exclusively British beers, but they've started to get a lot of good local craft brews, too. The beer is always cold and perfectly poured, and a pretty good value, too (most beers are 20 oz. pints for $5, unlike the 14 oz. \"pints\" you get in a lot of other places). The staff are also top-notch. Jefferson, Mattie and Bradley will always make sure you never have to wait too long to get another beer! They have an Internet jukebox with a good selection of tunes (surprisingly, many Internet jukeboxes have a crappy selection). But my favorite aspect: it's a PUB. It looks like a pub inside, with seemingly ancient posters for London Underground and McEwan's inside. I love it!"}
{"text":"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.

After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  
Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back"}
{"text":"I must say it was a big dissapointment. 

Little bit of background before I start my review- my mom is from England, my family owned a British Pub (in the states) till I was a teenager, and the last time I had bangers and mash was in England.

Driving up to it is a little weird, the entrance is in the back of all the buildings.

Atmosphere- it was a little dark abut had a cute little pub vibe.

Staff- very friendly, but for it being pretty empty on a Thursday night waiting 10 mins to refill out drafts was a little much.

Food- Started with pan seared goat cheese fritters which were pretty good but I believe the pan needed to be cleaned. The best way I can describe it was that the outside had a pancakey taste. We also got the Irish potato pancakes which were the best thing we ate all night. I ordered the bangers and mash for my main course. They had it down as a plate to share? It just seems odd to me. It came with a side of peas (just as Mom would have served it). I wanted to like it but something was off. There was a curry type flavor to the gravy which did not pair well with the bangers which were just not what I was used to. My friend got the Shepards pie which was not the shepherds pie I am used to. Who knows my mom might just be a terrible cook. This was like stew with a thin layer of extra crispy mashed potatoes on top. The way to describe the taste was scortched. The stew like base just had this burnt taste to it. Mom always has a heap of mashed potatoes in hers so it never gets to where it's more of a crouton than a mashed potato....

Needless to say we skipped dessert.... I couldn't dare run the chance of them ruining apple pie for me!

I'm hoping it was just a bad night in the kitchen. My friend had been there a few times before and said the place is hit or miss, based on the reviews I'd say that's right."}
{"text":"Sir Eds is the place to go well.....All the time.
I work late nights and if I get out before the clock strikes 2 a.m. I know I can grab a great bite and a delicious cold Guinness. Always welcoming! The best pub food. Seriously. Would love to try them for lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that Sir Edmond's is back in business!

This is, quite literally, an out-the-way place.  You can access it from the front of the Park Road shopping center by a passageway, but if you have any mobility issues, you are better served by driving around the shopping center to the main entrance at the back.  In doing so, you'll discover a neat little area with an interesting secondhand shop and a charming outdoor garden shop.

Once you finally find the place, you'll discover that the inside suits its location.  You certainly get the feeling of eating in some tucked-away local nook.

Of course, the truly important thing about a restaurant is its food, and while part of the appeal of Sir Edmond's is surely it's location, it's food does not disappoint.  It's fairly typical pub far with a classy twist.  The shepherd's pie is delicious, and if you're feeling adventurous, try the ostrich meatloaf.  Unfortunately, the lamb sandwich they had before their temporary closure is nowhere to be found.  The portions seem smallish, but they are filling.

In short, I recommend Sir Edmund Halley's!"}
{"text":"We enjoy walking to Sir Ed's and sitting outside on the patio.  This is a great restaurant, and the staff are always friendly.  The burger is always a solid choice, and the Veggie club is really uniquely tasty, even sans meat.  Overall great restaurant."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's is my favorite spot to grab some food late at night. Unlike other late-night options, the menu is pretty extensive - from Thai chicken skewers to the artichoke, zucchini and portobello melt. 

But I don't think I would ever go there if I had to sit inside. It's tiny, smoky and a little creepy to be honest.

The outside patio is totally different. You're surrounded by pretty trees and plants and feel as though you've stumbled upon some secret garden bar. And in some ways, you have. Sir Ed's is behind the Park Road Shopping Center and you take a strange journey down the back alley to get there. 

It's a fun atmosphere and good for groups of friends. I've always had friendly servers, although it's not the speediest service."}
{"text":"I love this place for their patio as we're always looking for restaurants to take the pup along. Such a neat, tucked away little gem. With all the commotion around Montford and Park Rd Shopping Center, it would be easy to never know this place is there. The patio has fairly nice landscaping which makes for a very nice ambiance.

Only reason for the 2 star review is for the inconsistencies. One night you'll get amazing service, the next night you'll get a server that seems like he/she (usually she) hates his/her life. They have an awesome menu with several vegetarian options. Really enjoy this place, just wish the friendliness came out a little more on a consistent basis. It's also nice too have a late night food menu option!

My go to's: 

Roasted Vegetables and Black Bean Nachos - it's not often you find a solid nacho option that doesn't have beef or chicken. 

Ginger Salmon Burger with aioli slaw"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to review this place because it is one of my favorite secret little hide aways in Charlotte but people do deserve to know and I love seeing the place do well.

I have been to England many times because I have family there and this feels like an authentic neighborhood English pub.

The food is actually fantastic. It is not traditional terrible bar food. I do not think I have had a bad thing on the menu and I have tried most of it. I love coming for a late night bite and a pint or there have been several occasions where I have come for dinner itself. The burger is very well seasoned and is one of the best straight up cheeseburgers in Charlotte. Some of the more traditional UK food like Shepard's Pie and Bangers and Mash are also very well done here. I have Bangers and Mash every Christmas (100+ year-old family tradition) and this place definitely does it well. I'm not a fish person but I have heard the Fish and Chips is spot on too.

The inside has a terrific pub atmosphere for mingling or grabbing a table with your mates. The outside boasts a nice brick patio under some trees for an almost secret garden feel."}
{"text":"Was it wonderful no but the secluded outside dining area is perfect for an outside Spring day. The interior looks like it could use a makeover and updating.

The staff was very friendly and heather our waitress was very good.

I had the Ostrich Meatloaf a slight sweet taste to the meat but very good, The mashed potatos were not the best but with the meat and gravy were very good.

The wife had the Wahoo catch of the day, it was a very well prepared but a little too much seasoning buried the flavor of the fish but not to the point you could not enjoy it.

The Garlic hummus was wonderful and Pita, Carrots and Cucumber were fresh.

We will go back but I can tell you as it got closer to 6pm it picked up considerably, business wise.

So it appears to be popular.

GIve it a shot.

PS
Half Price bottle of Wines on Weds."}
{"text":"Usually, I really enjoy Sir Ed's. Its mainstays are having good beers on tap and simple, hearty food. However, this time I decided to try their \"award winning\" burger. I'm not sure when that award was won, but whomever made it this time was not the same person -- it came out overcooked and disappointing. My companion's French dip looked and tasted good and most of the cooked food others in my group got looked and smelled even better."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Sir Edmond Halley's two stars is because the food was fairly decent.  The service and prices were disappointing!

We went on a Tuesday night around 7:30 pm.  The restaurant was full but we were able to get the last table.  I over heard a server had called in sick and the servers that were working were running around like crazy.  I heard this from the manager / owner that was casually sitting with some friends at the table next to us.  Instead of getting up and helping his staff, he mingled with his friends the entire time we were there.  

Throughout the dinner we had three different servers stop by all of which had not communicated about our order, etc.  I can understand and tolerate this as they were all trying -but  I continued to be annoyed by the manager / owner just sitting by watching.  

We ordered a wedge salad and added blue cheese crumbles and a side of ranch and a fish fry to share between the two of us.  My boyfriend ordered a Stella and I ordered a vodka soda with a splash of cranberry.  

The food and drinks were good.  My dissappoinment came when we received the bill (after waiting for it for 10 minutes). 

We were charged $1.50 for blue cheese crumbles (and not told it would be an extra charge), $.50 for the side of ranch for the salad and $.50 for the \"splash\" of cranberry that was probably a tablespoon worth.  If the original menu items were cheap - I wouldn't have minded but I thought the prices were a bit extreme for the actual food that we received.  

It's unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Big menu, ordered the salmon on romaine salad. Look forward to coming back at night."}
{"text":"Half-price bottles on wine on Sunday! I don't think I need to say more, but I will. I just love this place. It's cozy and off the beaten path. The fish and chips were perfection as was the goat cheese fritters. I can't wait to go back...on a Sunday of course."}
{"text":"I love coming here in the spring to fall for dining outside at the patio! The service is always good. The lunch specials for $8 are a hit for quality and quantity. Or if you want to just pop in for a pint than that is great too. My personal favorite is either the turkey sandwich or the salmon salad. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Jabari wings are the best wings in Charlotte.  Grilled to a perfect char, with a sweet ginger teriyaki sauce, they are perfect!

Chicken fried chicken, black bean burger, fish & chips, butternut squash croquettes and jerk chicken nachos are also HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great Guinness pour! I love our Irish bartender! He's always accommodating. Potato cakes are wonderful! Tenderloin with asparagus was off the chain delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a decent English / Irish Pub.  I love the cozy feeling and the inside is very well put together.  They have a decent selection of beer from across the pond as well as lots of local Charlotte craft beer on tap.  

The food was great, but the portions were a bit smaller than most other similar style restaurants in the area.  I was a bit disappointed with the shepherd's pie.  It looks great, but the bowl is very shallow and the meat was ground and just didn't retain any sort of lamb taste or texture.  

We loved the service and the location is easy to get to.  They have a nice outside seating area during nicer weather with lots of room for special occasions and live music.  

All in all, this place is decent if you have a hankering for some beer and fish-n-chips."}
{"text":"It's another pub- very authentic atmosphere- wish the ketchup was Heinz!
The cod tacos were listed as blackened but I felt they needed more seasoning- maybe poco de gallo added ?
My husband had the Brussels sprouts that were also very good."}
{"text":"Overall, it is a very chill place to go and have a drink. I got the Hong Kong vegetarian egg rolls which were good but the sauce you dip them in was very hot. The creamy tomato soup was very good but if you're not a goat cheese fan do not get it. The location of the restaurant is very confusing. If you park in the shopping center, park near the restaurant CO and walk down the alley. The restaurant is down the stairs on the left."}
{"text":"Well, tucked away in Park Road shopping center is this older Charlotte restaurant. Now we were a large party of 12 in a back room--but they should have given us a dedicated waiter. We had a nice girl but....she was also working the patio ( pretty far from us) and I also saw her behind the bar. So starting off ..the Service..bad..almost none..now there was a couple of different food runners, so maybe they should train them in to be waiters. I was never asked and could never gain the waiters attention to order a drink. I had water all night. A kind of strange menu with some nice vegitarian choices and then a few english pub items. I ordered  a GRILLED CHEESE. Now as far back as I can remember ..a GRILLED CHEESE is GRILLED...Nope ..not this one. I had asked for Bacon instead of how it was listed as a Black Forest Ham and Havarti Grilled Cheese.  Well, it came on WHITE Bread ..(listed on the menu as multi grain ) and it had two small four inch pieces on on half and a half a slice of cheese. and then One four inch strip on the other half with the other half slice of cheese. Bread was dry..was supposed to have mustard. AND TOTALLY UNGRILLED! It took me a minute to try and see what the sandwich was about ...NOTHING...not at all a 6.95 ADULT GRILLED CHEESE as it said on my check With  1.50 extra charged for BACON..which  I would be surprised if it amounted to a whole slice. That paired with nothing to drink but water..would have normally caused me to exit but it was a birthday party and I was invited so I stayed. The whole idea of a grilled cheese is the toasted buttery exterior of the bread and the melty cheese inside. NADA..not here.  The other guests were not too happy with their entrees either..Only one Appetizer was liked by all and that was the Buffalo Fried Cauliflower , .Bad Reuben Sandwiches..which is kind of English, very mediocre Fish and Chips and a Dry French dip. I won't be traveling back to the rear of Park Road Shopping Center again...Sorry ED!"}
{"text":"Love the Lemon Chicken! The service is wonderful. The owner of the old East Blvd Bar and Grill is working here with his brother! Wonderful food. Great old pub atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love the fish n chips. Good beer selection. Service was iffy for a while, but think that has been fixed. Great service last few times I went. Really nice patio too"}
{"text":"Three stars only because the inside is dark and though the patio is great, I have yet to sit out there when I did not have to endure cigarette smoke. I've seem them let folks smoke (against city ordinance) or they seem ok with people smoking at the door/hostess area, which impacts the entire patio!  I don't get that at all (inhaling unhealthy smoke/awful smell plus paying for a meal to eat it with smoke, in this day & time, no thank  you. Frustrated about the smoke because  it is convenient, parking is easy, the food is good!!  If I hear otherwise, I will return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Sir Ed's after hearing quite a few people recommend it. I had heard that there were a good number of vegetarian option, especially for a pub. I would say that that part is true. 

I ordered the stuffed zucchini and was not very impressed. The sauce was a marinara, but it was watery in texture, and very salty. I also couldn't really tell if the zucchini was stuffed with anything else of substance. I feel like they halved the zucchini, cut the seeds out, cooked it, and poured sauce over it. Even my college roommate had more talent than that.

On the other hand, my mom ordered the Quinoa, Spinach & Roasted Vegetables, which she let me try and I thought was pretty decent. It still wasn't overly impressive, but it looked like more effort had been put into the creation of the dish than mine. 

The service was fine... nothing to rave about, but not terrible either. 

I feel like this place is going to be hit or miss depending on what you order and when you go, which is reflected in their mixed reviews. Not sure I would bother to go again honestly."}
{"text":"They have the best Shandy in town!  Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was really fun.  I went with a group of people from work and really enjoyed myself.  

It's a bit hard to find, as it's behind the Harris Teeter.  I had to drive around a few minutes to find it.  While out of the way, it really has the feel of an English Pub.  

Some great British pints (read: Old Speckled Hen).  Food was decent for British food (Ha!).  

I am definitely going back to sit at the bar and raise a few."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were fine. The fish was hot, the fries were decent steak fries, and the service was prompt and knowledgeable. I would return."}
{"text":"Love coming here after work to see Jeff, Sam, or Abbey.  Everyone is wonderful and welcoming. Guinness is awesome.  So is the food, I recommend this local spot for sure."}
{"text":"We just stopped in last night as we were discussing how we havent been in there in forever.  We just stopped in to grab a few pints and ended up ordering some fries with gravy.  Their gravy is amazing! They have some great beers on top.

They have trivia on Monday nights and hold it in the back area so that the front area, even though the bar is very small, is still pretty quiet. 

If you've never been, the bar itself is extremely dark with no windows what so ever. . It's nice when its warm out as they have a huge patio. It can be hard to find if you havent been before as it is tucked in the back of park road shopping center."}
{"text":"Hello, old friend. What's not to love about Sir Ed's? Seriously. They're like that old elementary school buddy you might go years without seeing but as soon as you're hanging out in the same place at the same time, it's like no time at all has passed. On our most recent visit, the first in a year, at least, I didn't even pick up the menu. Intuitively, I ordered without hesitation, \"Jerk chicken nachos, please!\" I mean, it's a no brainer. I've been eating those nachos as a late night treat for almost 15-years. 

I was living abroad when they closed temporarily. I almost bought airfare home for one last order of those nachos. Thankfully, some saint decided to revive ol' Sir Ed's not long after they closed and the late night shenanigans live on! 

Does the place have it's faults? Certainly. But, who doesn't? On those nights I'm not feeling their beer selection, I go with a proseccco. If it's too loud and somehow kinda smokey inside (even though you haven't been able to smoke inside restaurants in NC for years) I'll just hang out on the patio. Slow service? No big deal. More time to hang out with the table of friends sure to be along for the evening. 

I may see you next weekend or next year, Sir Ed's. Regardless, I know we'll hit it off as if we just saw each other the day before. No menu needed thankyouverymuch."}
{"text":"I
They re-opened under new mgmt.

 love the chicken friend chicken, it is sooo crispy.  I feel like I\"m in a dark hole though when I\"m there.  Interesting menu.  Wow I just read they closed last night for good."}
{"text":"I actually have mixed feelings about reviewing this place, because it's probably one of my favorite places to hang out in Charlotte.  Located in Park Rd Shopping Center... it's very easy to miss since the place is located behind the shopping center.  The only indication you have that it is there from the front of the shopping center is a small sign in between Ski Country Sports and Rack Room Shoes.

There is parking in the back (if Sir Edmond's is your only destination) if you don't want to mess with all the shopping traffic.  Park Rd Shopping Center is undergoing a renovation to bring the place back to it's former glory... for the most part the changes are pretty nice, but the construction can be a pain.

Sir Edmond's has great atmosphere... once you find it... it feels like your own little secret.  It's got some great beers on tap (some local) but I always feel obligated to get a Guinness here (so good out of the tap!).  The food is excellent.  There is an eclectic choice of UK food... and some choices that don't seem very British... but it's great to have the option if you aren't feeling the fish and chips that evening/day.

Server's are super nice and the bar keep makes for good conversation.  Their patio is so great!  It is located in a busy shopping center, but it feels like its in its own little world.  One that I like to frequently visit as much as possible...."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to Sir Ed's but I remember it more as a English Pub with more British food options than what I saw on the menu tonight.

Like some have said, finding the place can be a challenge but the restaurant fits in it's little nook, just nicely and even has a nice outdoor patio to compliment the restaurant.

Inside its dark with dark woods at the bar and a long bench along the front wall.  Tables are big but the wood bench is very uncomfortable.

The menu is actually very diverse with 1/2 of it being vegetarian options but missing from it is Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash and a few other British staples.

Our group started out with black bean an d roasted vegetable nachos which were a bit scarce on the black beans and roasted vegetables.  We also had the goat cheese fritters which were tasty but  bit dry.

For the entree, i went with something non-traditional because like I said, the traditional options are scarce.  I had the cod tacos.   The coating on the cod was overcooked and hard and crunchy.  The salsa on the tacos was flavorful but the tortillas were dry and a little rubbery.  They could have been steamed to loosen them up a little.  Also a sauce would have been nice on the taco.  They gave me a tiny slice of lime but the lime was dry and the skin was brown which was quite unappetizing.  The fries were good but it's hard to ruin fries.

Others at my table had the broccoli parmesan, the french dip and the chicken fried chicken....all items i wouldn't expect at an English pub.

The service was good but the menu just left me wanting to go over to Big Ben's.  Sorry, Sir Ed."}
{"text":"My local pub.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Was so happy when they reopened.  GREAT food, GREAT pints, GREAT staff.  I have a 2 year old and the patio is perfect for her.  Love coming here for after work drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"OK bar.  Decent staff.  food...not great.  Good-sized patio outside.  Needs some updating."}
{"text":"I feel like Sir  Ed's is a good bar but the food, while delicious is overpriced. The indoor section of the bar is dark and divey and on my last visit the AC was on full blast which made me wish I had brought a sweater out on a day where the outside temperature was well into the 80s. 

I have tried several of their menu items. My favorite meal was the seared tuna salad. I had this delicious dish one afternoon out on the patio while my dog hung out with me. The waitress was kind enough to bring him a water bowl! On a more adventurous visit I tried the ostrich meatloaf, which wasn't really my thing but I had not tried ostrich before. 

On the last visit we ordered the buffalo shrimp. I had meant to get the buffalo cauliflower because of the rave reviews but when I saw it was only a dollar more to have shrimp I changed my mind. Maybe I should have stuck with the vegetables since the shrimp were tiny and a large portion of the already small shrimp was the batter. The flavor was good but the portion seemed small for the price.

For the entrée I decided to pretend like I eat healthy and ordered the stuffed zucchini (with goat cheese fritters and a vegetable ragu). The sauce and the zucchini was delicious but the fritters were cold and unappealing. I gave them both away after I had a bite. You don't want to give away food when you paid $13 for a vegetarian dish. 

The beer selection is pretty good (they have fortnight on tap!) but I don't think they carry oranges for Blue Moon. I have ordered it twice there and each time no orange slice for me even after I asked for one which is a shame because I love snacks with my drinks."}
{"text":"I've been by Park Road Shopping Center many times, but I had never known about this little gem hidden towards the back. I stopped in to continue my reuben adventure around Charlotte, and I was quite pleased I found this spot. The corned beef on this reuben was one of the best I've found around Charlotte, full of flavor and freshly carved for the sandwich - definitely in the top 3 of all the corned beef I've had on the 25+ reubens around the city. The kraut had the tartness required in a reuben, and it was finished out with a generous portion of cheese and russian. The biggest miss came with their one deviation from the standard reuben - using sourdough instead of rye. Overall it was a delicious reuben and one I plan to have again."}
{"text":"Sir Ed's has definitely been around the block. Or maybe that's me. Or maybe it's just that you have to go around back to get there. One nice thing is that the back door (heh) has changed a bit over the years, and now isn't quite as drab as it once was. Of course, with changing times come an entirely different experience, though it depends entirely where you sit.

If you go inside, then it really isn't that different - it's almost like you're in a dark and dreary pub anywhere in the world, and both the service and the food (and drink) can match. You'll likely come out in a worse mood than you went in, simply because it's not a very pleasant place.

However, if you sit outside, it's like you're in a completely different world. Yes, you are in a parking lot (well, next to a parking lot). But it's not traveled that much - the back door never is, after all - and the landscaping and mood lighting definitely help. Okay, before this deteriorates too much: The only downside is that the service can be slower, but it's worth checking out, especially if you've never tried it before. Hmm. Can't get away from it, so I'll just give up at this point and let you try for yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of vegetarian dishes. There were so many choices, we can't wait to go back and try more.  We ordered curry fries, the fresh fish special, tofu curry and a blackened salmon wrap. All were large portions and we took some left overs to go. We ate outside and it was a very nice atmosphere, secluded behind Park Rd shopping center."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I used to frequent this hole in the wall a few years ago before they closed as it was near to his house and it was just a great place to grab a few pints. He moved to a different part of town and we never got the memo they reopened, oops. 

Thankfully an invite from a friend and we know it's back in action. 

The new menu is great! I had the vegan quinoa burger with fries. It's awesome, that's all I can really say. The tomato compote is perfect - I needed no other condiment. My meat-eating man enjoyed the Jamaican Jerk Nachos. They were presented nicely and according to him tasty . There are several other vegan sides and miscellaneous items that I plan on trying. 

The bartender was attentive even on a busy night and my glass was never empty too long. $4 for a 20oz Stella most nights - I'm in. 

I'm so glad this little hole in the wall is back in action and better than before."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here just an hour ago. His food, in his words, was \"pretty okay\". He had the buffalo chicken wrap. My food is indescribable without using excessive profanity: but here goes. I ordered the Reuben. It was plated nicely, huge visual appeal. First bite? Awful. Rubbery dog sh*t with half*ss corned beef flavor. Usually a small part of whatever meat is going to be gristle or rubbery or whatever but the rest is redeemable or great. So I tried two more bites which were equally awful. Then made my boyfriend (nicest guy ever) try a bite. He didn't say anything. I left the whole thing mangled on the plate. I want to say I'm disappointed in my food but 'disgusted' and 'outraged' fit way better. Suggestion for you guys- put the Reuben with the French dip: OFF THE MENU.

We will not return."}
{"text":"We were meeting a few of my brother's friends here for a quick bite to eat before dinner. Little did I know that this is his go-to pub when he's in the area. It is easy to miss at first since it's located behind the shopping center. Just follow the little sign and down a flight of stairs until you reach a Tudor-style front entrance that transports you to what I would imagine an English or Irish pub looks like. The ceilings are a little low but it adds to the charm and intimacy of the place. Our server was really great and funny. They have Guinness on tap! The menu had a lot of options perfect for sharing with a group. My brother and I just split two appetizers but the portions were big enough to pass around the table to share. The Flash Fried Zucchini was excellent - crispy and nicely seasoned. The Goat Cheese Fritters were my brother's pick. I didn't really care for the Cabernet sauce. I really wish I tried one of the entrees like the  Classic English Fish and Chips but all the more reason to come back. Only complaint was there is only one unisex bathroom, at least in the front that I saw, but would you expect more from a classic pub?"}
{"text":"I've never been there to eat.....but I do go on occasion to have a beverage.  It's the perfect non-descript place to have a drink with someone if you don't really care to be seen by many people, as this place is hidden below Park Rd. Shopping center. 

The drinks are always made well....and the bartenders are really nice.  

The inside is lacking as far as decor goes....but that's alright with me really.   They seem to do pretty well there....and from what I can tell...the food looks pretty good.

This place has always been a staple for me in the last 8 years or so....I'll continue to go back because it has a \"top secret\" appeal being so hidden away."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Best fried zucchini I have ever had. Chicken fried chicken was amazing. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great time!  Go on a Monday and play the trivia.  Get there early or call ahead.  The fish and chips are awesome and so was the chips and gravy.  We had such an awesome time, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go a lot back when they first opened and Tobin was in the kitchen all the time, I always liked it and went back quite a bit. I heard that they had reopened and some of the originals were back, so the wife and I tried them for lunch. First of all, the place looks pretty much the same. It seems like they may have painted and \"spruced up\" some but overall it still looks like an authentic British Pub. I heard they had some good vegetarian offerings and I wanted to check them out. It turns out that there aren't really that many vegetarian options, mainly the \"burger\" and the stuffed pepper. I went with the stuffed pepper and my wife got the much lauded fish and chips. The pepper was quite good with nice flavors, I would have liked more seasoning but that is just me. My only complaint, albeit minor, was that the quinoa on top was a little too crunchy. The fish and chips was another story. We expected something piping hot, extremely crisp and salty just waiting for some malt vinegar. While it was a nice piece of cod, the fry job was less than stellar, not as crisp as it should have been and nearly completely devoid of seasoning. A disappointment for sure. The service was somewhat hit and miss, our waitress vanished a couple of times and we had to seek her out to get the check. If you like the \"pub feel\" and just want a pint at the bar then this is your place. We will give them another chance but with all the competition for my dining dollar, they won't be back in the rotation anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a cool location.  I enjoy the dark-pub like feel and atmosphere.  They have pretty decent food, depending on what you like.  The fish and chips is always a go to for me.  I have not been here for a long time, but hope to return one day soon.  

The service is always ok-hit or miss, but never had any bad experiences.  They have indoor seating, or course and patio seating-which I have yet to try!

Will be back for more and to update my review."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a coupon in Go Play Save and had never been before. It wasn't anything amazing or warranting special trips over, but it was a decent food spot for lunch. 

They have an extensive outside patio that is secluded from the rest of the shopping center, and was beautiful on a warm fall day. And it's quiet from the rest of the hustle of the shopping center. 

Food menu was typical pub fare. We had the edamame for an appetizer and there was a generous amount of that. For lunch, my fiancé had their cheeseburger and noted that the burger was cooked to a perfect medium, but his mashed potatoes were just average. I had the blackened fish tacos, and they were good, and the blackening spice was spicy. I just wish there was another dimension of flavor besides the spice of the fish. Again, everything was good, but nothing \"mindblowing\". 

Service was sub par, had to ask a few times for my beverage and the server forgot to bring back my credit card to sign, I had to remind her. But looking positively, you certainly aren't rushed here so you can enjoy our beautiful Charlotte weather!"}
{"text":"I went here recently for my birthday. The Fish and Chips are spot on. The staff are awesome and the service is great paced. The burgers are great too. Be sure to join the birthday club for a free meal on your birthday. If you love the pub scene or love British food please check out this place out."}
{"text":"We used to go to Sir Edmund's often. Then a couple of years ago, they closed for renovation, so it wasn't on our radar until last night. We were glad it still has that great pub atmosphere and that the menu still had our favorites. However, the items that used to be great we're just OK last night. The goat cheese fritters were very bland. I actually had to add salt to them. Without good seasoning, they lost their \"wow\" factor. The kids' grilled cheese was dry and bland and the fries soft.  The service, although friendly. was very slow last night. Two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room.  We waited 20 minutes before anyone took our food order.  They have 2 menus: entrees and bar food which includes appetizers. The choices are good but too pricey to choose 2 appetizers  as your meal along with a salad. We may go again if we are in the area, but it will be for the beer and atmosphere, not for good food."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for what it is -- an English neighborhood pub/restaurant. The service is great, the beers always taste right (equipment is clean) and the food is reasonably priced and served in appropriate sized portions. We love coming here with our family for dinner and drinking Old Speckled Hen and Guinness on draft."}
{"text":"A service industry employee's joint.  Late nights are.incredible here and it makes me feel like I'm in a European pub more than a bar on the backside of park road shopping center.  Solid food, great draft menu and cool folks.  Never really liked the tables here because they are so big but it's a perfect place to meet up with a group and order a ton of apps. Especially the goat cheese fritters."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. Most recently, we went for a team lunch and I want impressed. 

The restaurant was almost completely empty and I'm still took 40 minutes to get our food. 

I got the corned beef brisket which was just ok. The meat was kind of dry and I probably wouldn't get it again. The side of coleslaw was what you would expect from a mayonnaise based coleslaw. 

Overall, I was a lot less impressed on this visit than on previous visits and will probably not come back again."}
{"text":"I was excited to stumble upon this place and see its charming, eclectic menu- something rare in Charlotte.  Maybe the experience was a disappointment because of the hype I put in my own head?  Or maybe it really did leave a lot to be desired...

Excited to be seated, we were not sure if we seat ourselves or see a hostess.  This was obstacle #1.  After awkwardly standing around for a while we were finally helped and sat.

Long story short: we both got the Rueben, which was good.  But then again, how hard is it to mess up a Rueben?  It was served with fries (a very small amount) and they have malt vinegar on the table for your fries.  Score!

Although the food was decent, the service was not.  I had to ask for refills on my water multiple times, ask for the check, and ask her to run our cards.  

I'm hoping it was an off day as this place SEEMS as though it could be a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I was a little leary when I arrived. It was really hard for me to find the place and as many have already said, it's a bit dank and dismal inside. But what they lack in aesthetics and ambiance is made up with one banging fish and chips plate. It's about the best I've tasted so far here in Charlotte. You get a nice, thick meaty piece of cod. Thr batter is so light and crunchy. I loved every bit of it. I didn't even think to ask for some malt vinegar until i was about done. I loved their thick cut potatoes too. Quite hearty and substantial. Very satisfying for the $10 price tag.  If I can ever find it again I will definitely be back. It looked like the kind of place where you could have a good time with a drink or two."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for dinner.  It was a warm evening, and I was so glad to slink into the coolness of this basement.  Kind of like a dungeon, in the nicest way.  That night, wine bottles were half off.  So what are two catchin' up style gals to do but to get a bottle of the Kim Crawford Savignon Blanc.
Because of the heat, we wanted salads, but also a little extra to soak up that wine.  So, we each got an appetizer.  My friend got buffalo shrimp.  They also featured buffalo cauliflower, which my heat craving taste buds longed for.  But since we were sharing, I got the butternut squash croquettes with the Brie fondue.
Our salad arrived crisp and fresh.  Because I make my own salad dressing at home out of healthy and minimal ingredients, I typically choose yummy, decadent blue cheese dressing when dining out.  And good it was!
The butternut croquettes were fried crunchy with a sweet, soft center.  The Brie fondue was an extra good added touch.  My friend agreed.
Which leads me to my friend.  The buffalo shrimp must have been extra good because she did not offer to share with me.  As she was munching on one of my croquettes, I looked at her plate to see only shrimp tails left!  As a woman who is always in search of hot and spicy food, I found myself regretting that I did not order the buffalo cauliflower.
Next time..."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the first time. It was trivia night. I enjoyed my fish and chips; the tartar sauce has something in it that gives it some pizazz.  My other half thought the Wahoo fish was good.  They felt the veggies that came with it were a bit bland though. We had a good time overall."}
{"text":"So, it has been years since I have been here, but my Mom, who recently moved to Charlotte, remembered our visit. She wanted to check it out, being a nice night and the patio is a nice treat. We arrived at 6:30 and got the last open table outside. After 10 minutes we were brought menus and water, one short. From there it took us over 20 minutes to place our order, which included having to ask the drink specials, and what was on tap, & the waitress said \"it's on the back of the menu\". After reviewing we ordered and waited another 45 minutes for our meal, which came out incorrect. It was corrected immediately, however, the server was very rude and short with everything! I also need to note, sitting outside offers smoking, so be warned. We, unfortunately sat @ two tables that included chain smokers...somewhat annoying while you are trying to enjoy a drink and dinner. 
As far as the food, I ordered the zucchini cake, which was undercooked, however, the others ordered the fish & chips, amazing. I will make sure I enjoy that dish if I return. Overall the food was good, but the service was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Good food, really cool space. 

Love that it's in this dark basement with low ceilings, really adds to the charm of the Irish restaurant. 

I had the fish and chips and they were on point. Really cool place to go if you are tired of the granola, ultra modern places that put a spin on food that was good the way it was."}
{"text":"I don't give 1-star often, but I think this \"staple\" has earned it with the \"winning\" combo of overpriced food & beer, lack of menu options, and non-existent service. I came here on Friday to join a few friends after work for drinks and for the free personalized Guinness pint glass offer. The bartender turned out to be also the waiter for us in the back dining room, which means we seldomly saw him. He wasn't exactly friendly, but I guess he got the job done at the minimum since he did bring us our beer and put in our food order and checked on us every now and then... but was a smile that hard to come by? Do I really have to be a regular to get any friendly service? Worst was the food runner... which we didn't know that's her only job there (not like they have waitstaff uniforms on for us to distinguish). So when a late comer asked her to take his beer order, she snapped back \"I am not your waiter!\"  WELL, thank goodness she wasn't our waiter with that attitude. More interestingly, this very same food runner had to deliver a dish to the corner table next to ours that was blocked in by 2 big tables (ours and another one). Instead of doing her job the right way and walk around the both big tables to get to the corner table, she just pretty much demanded my friend to get up & push in the chair, so she could squeeze by... how lazy and unprofessional was that?! That pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for me.

To add salt in a wound, besides Guinness that was on special at the bargain price of $4, Fat Tire was $5... I didn't think Fat Tire is that caliber of a beer. Food was pricey as well, $4 for a basket of fries but with curry sauce (which would be the only reason I order fries/chips in an English pub) is $5, $14 for fish & chips and that didn't look like a huge order. They had more wings options than anything thing else... but if I want wings I probably would have gone to somewhere else. I ended up with $8.50 of blacken fish tacos. It was ok, the fish still had lots of liquid after being cooked, which didn't mix well with the slaw and tortilla wrap. I did enjoy the cup of soup as my side. 

In short, I echo the other reviewer: I'll go to Big Ben any day over this joint if I am feeling a British pub mode. At least they have better menu options, and most certainly better service."}
{"text":"Nice Pub Food in Park Rd Plaza.  We came here for a after work going away function and it was good place to hang out with a dark Irish pub feel.  Place is bigger than it looks than when you first walk it. 

They had several seasonal beers on tap (this time Saranac Oktoberfest and some pumpkin) and the food was good. I got to sample the Chicken Fingers which looked to be hand breaded there.  Then I got a order of the Cod fish tacos.   The blackened seasoning was really good, but if you order it get it with a side of sweet potato fries.  It really compliments it."}
{"text":"The bartender was great, the outside seating is great and the beer selection is pretty good with what you might expect for something styled as a British pub - Guinness, Harp and suchlike.

Where Sir Edmond's seems to be letting down the side is the food options. Sure, they have a Fish and Chips, but where's the curry? Where's the jacket potato? Burgers are fine, but that's American food not proper British fare.

I was here a few years ago and maybe my standards are higher now. If you want drinks with a Scottish flag on the wall, here's Sir Edmond (aside from that it's served cold for Yanks and the taps aren't hand-pulls). But if you want a good lamb stew or a shepherd's pie, I think you're better off at Big Ben."}
{"text":"I had lunch there- food was really good, based on the other reviews I am going to check out the bar after work."}
{"text":"Love this secretly hidden pub!! 

Food is DELICIOUS & great beers on draft - the ambiance inside is dark and dungeon-like; they also have outdoor seating when it's nice out. Sit at the bar - the bartender (sound it out like \"Gare-Road\")  is a sweet as can be, quick service & knows everything about the place & menu.

Best Tip About this place: you have to know where to look to find it : )"}
{"text":"Today after visiting Winghaven Gardens , our group wanted lunch. I had wanted to go to this restaurant and other mentioned a deli across the way. I like to try different places and could not locate the deli. So off to Park Road Shopping Center. I use to work in this area and never knew this place was here. A little hard to find but it is by Rack room , a path and down some stairs. . I was so glad the 4 in my group went. We were not sure if we wanted to eat inside or out and opted for inside. it seemed a bit dark at first but after your eyes adjusted, it was fine.  I was so glad to be here. It was quiet and I knew Deli would be noisy. 
We all ordered something different. We all enjoyed what we had which was , Portebello Mushrooms sandwich, the pesto chicken sandwich. a BLT and I had the Reuben. Two had the sweet potato fries and they were nice and thick,not stringy or small. Myself and other party had the cup of tomato soup, delicious.  My Reuben although not on rye bread was very good. Corned beef was excellent.
Only note is that when I got ready to eat the second half it had become a bit soggy.
No problem, took off the top slice of bread and use knife and fork for the rest.
Service was great. Meal prices included tax. Some items it includes tax and beverage. others included tax and side dish.  Very reasonable prices. 
I will be returning to this establishment. 
Oh and here I thought it was a new place. NO , they have been there for 17 yrs!!"}
{"text":"Oh my, I love Sir Ed's. It is without a doubt the best bar in Charlotte. Sir Ed's doesn't have the biggest beer list or any unique drinks, but they make up for it in quality. My last few years of college I came in about once a week, sometimes more. I chose Sir Eds for my first legal drinks. Now when I come back to Charlotte the trip isn't complete without a plate of Jamaican Jerk Chicken nachos and a beer. 

Sir Ed's has some of the best bar/pub food  you'll find. Worth coming just for dinner. In the spring/summer/fall, the patio is fantastic. My world felt like it fell apart when Sir Ed's closed briefly, and I am so happy they're back!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips: better than the fish and chips in London. My husband, my friends all agree!

Bangladesh is amazing here!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read some of the more recent reviews more closely. I decided to go to SEH because of their outdoor deck and I really like Fish n Chips. The weather is great but the service mediocre at best. I ordered a salad and the Fish n Chips. As I waited for a long time for the salad I realized that the salad would likely come out with the entree: BINGO! The waitress brought them together and placed them on my table. 

I told her the salad shouldn't be served with the Fish n Chips and she told me that's how the kitchen put them up for her. I said they know better and so should you. I asked her to remove the salad. Five minutes later she came back and told me the salad had been taken off my check. REALLY??? Did they think I'd consider paying for a salad I sent back? 

I told her if someone cared they would have come out to talk to me. No one cared or came. 

Food 3, service 1....for me that's 1 star and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Well I Can Cross This Off My Bucket List!

A Charlotte native that has lived within 5 miles of this place for all of my life of 58 years l have always been intrigued by Sir Edmond Halley's brew pub.  Well I'm no longer intrigued, and I'm no longer chomping at the bit to hurry back.

My wife and I were looking for Midwood Smokehouse but it has yet to open, so I pulled into a parking space near the entrance and away we went.  Upon arrival it's like going into the basement of your house when the light bulbs are burned out.  Not very large but a decent sized bar greets you to your right, and a row of tables to your left, with a few in-between.  I'm hard pressed to describe as intimate.

We were seated on the left side row two tables down from a sleeping patron.  At this point I'm not sure if he is drunk and passed out or just tired, but our presence didn't awaken him.

The waitress was prompt and brought us a menu almost immediately.  I am the former representative of the old British company Lucas, and I told my spouse, look they have a Lucas refrigerator, because the water had no ice!

I decided on having a Ruben with a wedge salad and my wife had the fish and chips.  The Ruben was fine with fresh bread but was a little skimpy on the ingredients, and the wife's fish and chips was presentable with one large piece of Code and ample fries.  The fish was a little greasy and my wife was a little disappointed, so we switched plates after each ate about half.

The meal for both of us, valued in today's market should have been about $20, but addressing this establishment as Sir, extracts a $7.50 premium.  I can get a better Ruben from Jason's Deli for about the same price, but the Fish and Chips can be obtained from Captain D'S for over 50% less.  Someone has described the personally of the waitress as like seaweed, which is a little harsh but not too far from the truth.  

Granted I'm not coming here to drink so after a few pints of Stout beer, I'm sure my review would be more complimentary, but sober it is what it is! Enter at your own risk!"}

First off this place wins the award for creative location.  If you cannot find it locate the walking bridge connecting the strip mall to some cold war era looking apartment building in the rear, take the steps down and enter.

To me, this is the definition of pub.  Low lighting, dark wood, and real English pints.  The beer selection is perfect.

My meal of choice here: Goat cheese fritters to start followed by  Fish & Chips, although since I've cut out a lot of carbs I usually will substitute collard greens for the chips (amazing, but only available while supplies last).  I'll choose to wash it down with an Old Speckled Hen or four.

Perfect place to come on a Friday to start forgetting about your week and take it slow.

Not into seafood?  No worries, literally everything on the menu is phenomenal, but when in a pub, I'm sticking with pub fare, so my runner-ups are ostrich meatloaf or a good old fashioned bacon cheese burger.

It is a must try."}
