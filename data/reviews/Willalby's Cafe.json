{"text":"I have a long history with Willalby's.  A friend worked there years ago, and we would gather one morning each week to hang out with him and shoot the shite.  In those days, the coffee was battery acid, the soups were 75% salt, and the food was uniformly greasy (much like the grill, I'm guessing).  

Then a few years back, one of the old cooks bought the place and gave it a good scrub-down.  A simplified, breakfast only menu and a clean grill now means they can serve food that is truly delicious.  They serve Just Coffee, which is miles better than the old paint-stripper of yore.  They have retained their signature dishes like the Bomlet, which is still too much food for me, and have added the city's best french toast, which is what I usually order.  Thick-sliced bread, dipped and drowned in cinnamon butter, oh my god.  SO good.  The pancakes are HUGE, but are a little on the dense side for my taste, as I like them fluffier.  Portions are big, so you won't go hungry, ever, and prices are very reasonable.

It's true, weekend waits can be l-o-n-g, but if you know that in advance and relax, it's worth the wait.  If you want a quick in-and-out on a Sunday, maybe try Perkins instead.  Weekdays are more normal service.  I usually order just eggs, sausage and toast if I'm alone.  The waiters run the gamut of quiet, attentive server to \"hey we're having a party in here\" alt. types.  But I've never had a bad or mean server.  Sometimes, they just need a little friendly prodding.  You just have to grasp the Willy Street vibe, and then it's cool."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite breakfast place in town, and I think it's largely because of the friendly wait staff and coffee (Just Coffee blend- mmm...).  I do not take stars off for slow service- which may be found here during prime time dining hours.  Their food is good with ample vegetarian/vegan options.  If you're a fan of mushrooms I highly recommend the vegan biscuits and gravy, they also make a tasty tofu skillet.  Again, I'd go here for the bottomless blend of Just Coffee alone."}
{"text":"This is seriously my favorite brunch joint in Madison. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options (none of which are boring!). Last time I went, the service was a little slow, but it was also pretty busy for a weekday morning, so it's totally forgivable. I got the Fair Oaks skillet, and it was incredible. The veggie sausage is amazing. No matter what you order, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The kind of restaurant you half expect to run into Jello Biafra in. Sassy waiter and metal in the morning has turned this place into one of my new favorite spots. Also, the breakfast was delicious and the portions generous. I had the Hart's Content omelette and would certainly recommend to anyone.

Beware though, you do need to bring cash to this establishment. An ATM is available in the back in case you forget, you'll just be stuck paying a $3 ATM fee."}
{"text":"I find myself popping out of bed every Monday morning to grab an omelette and coffee from Tommy.  Great music and perky service. Try the Harts Content-a buttery, garlic heaven."}
{"text":"I love having a place like this in the neighborhood. The new management has cleaned it up and added great things to the menu like vegan biscuits & gravy (which are delicious, this coming from a meat-eater). AND it's open until 4am on weekends, which makes it the perfect spot for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Perfect little breakfast cafe.  Nothing fancy about it but the food was great and the coffee was hot!  Their pancakes are the size of a plate!  The huevos rancheros were amazing and a very big portion that includes hashbrowns.  If you're looking for a good cheap breakfast then this is your place."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed the food. We thought it was tasty and the portions are exceptionally large. You won't go hungry after eating here. However, the service was less than optimal. Service was lagging. Coffee took forever to get after asking the waitress several times. Food took an hour to get to our table. I understand it was busy but this was a drag."}
{"text":"Don't let the looks fool ya folks! By far, the best omelets, biggest awesomest pancakes and least expensive breakfast joint I've ever been too! Staff is cool and relaxed, food is hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! I love finding locally owned places when I visit new towns and this one was great! Loved the coffee, everything my party of six tasted was great, and they were very accommodating when we came in and took up half of their counter stools because the booths were a little small. Prices were reasonable and dishes offered ranged from breakfast favorites to vegan options. I'll definitely return again next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Good location but tiny and not good for larger groups.  So so food.  Tortillas burned beyond edible.  Not so pleasant wait person."}
{"text":"Great food, but on a Sunday afternoon it was extraordinarily slow. We waited almost 2 hours for our food. There was one person working the front and one person cooking."}
{"text":"This is my go-to diner, what I call lovingly the \"punk rock\" diner, because it seems to always play punk music.  Everything about this place is what you should expect from a lovely little greasy spoon next to a tattoo parlor.  The booths, the wood paneling on the walls, the seats at the bar, and all the accompanying kitsch.

The food is what you'd expect from a greasy spoon, so if you're expecting something upscale, go down the street to Sardine or whatever.  But if you want a solid breakfast or brunch for under $10, this is exactly the place.  The omelets are particularly good -- I'm a big fan of their bomblet and the spanakopita.  The service is lovely; the place is never particularly busy and the wait staff doesn't give you a lot of indie-holier-than-thou lip.

Bring a book, the morning paper, or a few friends."}
{"text":"Willabys makes me happy. Besides the diner from Pulp Fiction it creates my mental image of a diner. I was home for the holidays and went there as a destination.  The menu hasn't changed. The servers are great. The food takes a little time. Because it's cooked for you."}
{"text":"Went to Wallabys at 845 on a Saturday morning. The place looked pleasant, about half full. As soon as my girlfriend and I walked in, the waitress informed us, rather rudely, that there is about a 35 minute wait for food. We said thats fine and proceeded to sit down at the counter.

As soon as we sat down, the same woman told us not to sit anywhere near the abundant amount of dirty plates on the counter. No please, no explanation, just a second rude comment before we even got a coffee.

We left after that, we wanted breakfast, not  an attitude. Nothing is worse than being made to feel you did something wrong first thing in the morning.

Maybe this place is designed solely for it's regulars, or that's a special code of conduct, but if you want a pleasant breakfast- avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Did you know this place existed??  I didn't either, until last weekend when the Mr and I stumbled upon it on a blustery Sunday morning.  The cafe was nearly empty, but that's OK, it's small.  We shared a 'Fair Oaks Skillet', sausage, american fries, onions, green peppers, topped with two eggs.  It was actually really good, and the service was outstanding.  Just a couple of young guys working the place, but they were great- 

Good visit...until...you need to find the restroom.  It's downstairs, in the back, but that's all I can tell you since my eyes were closed for much of the trip.  Eww, eww, eww.

Will we be back? Not tomorrow, but someday."}
{"text":"Vegan French Toast. That alone is enough to get me to come back here, and I'm not even vegan. The waitstaff was friendly, it was clean, the food was good, and it was cheap. For a \"greasy spoon\" that all I really need. 

*Also, if you're a coffee drinker they serve Just Coffee."}
{"text":"Willaby's diner/cafe is a serious greasy spoon, but that's why I like it, the food is good, the prices are good, and the pancakes are huge, you really only need one if that. It's cash only so be prepared. I love them."}
{"text":"I love Willalby's !!!!
A wonderful much-needed greasy spoon in the Willy St. area. The service is great, it is a nice and warm atmosphere, and the food is always exactly what I need on a Saturday morning. I hope it never leaves!"}
{"text":"Old, dive-y diner, with a Willy Street twist.  I'm embarrassed to say it, but I think I eat here every weekend. 

The service is usually slow, but it's the weekend and so am I.  If it's busy, just plan on waiting a while for your food. 

I usually switch between the bomblet or the fair oaks skillet.  If you had a little too much fun the night before, the skillet is where it's at.  Greasy, meaty, potato-y and cheesy.  You'll also be full for at least 2 days if you can polish it off.  My friends have raved about the pancakes and the vegan french toast as well.

The coffee is Just Coffee these days, but for some reason it still tastes like standard diner coffee.  Not a bad thing really, but definitely not my cup of tea (coffee?). I only get it because of the awesome mugs."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place recently.  

I love a nice, relaxed diner atmosphere, one without pretension, and Willalby's fits the bill.  Equally important, they have fantastic vegetarian offerings (like tofu and veg sausage and even nondairy cheese), so I can actually get a veg meal with protein that's yummy.

The prices are good and the service is friendly without being pushy. This isn't a place to go if you want some flashy hangout where the staff will fawn all over you, but if you'd like to have a filling, tasty breakfast at a good price, go for it."}
{"text":"I want to like Willaby's (good location, they used to be open late) but they fail me on my favorite diner foods: omelette and hash browns. The omelettes use some kind of fake cheese that make me feel sick every time. The potatoes are only ok. 

They also make big, flour-heavy pancakes that are the size of dinner plates that are probably a safer bet. Even though it's a drive, I prefer Dairyland Family Restaurant out on Cottage Grove for my non-ironic diner needs."}
{"text":"Great food, but I don't feel like I can go back here anymore because of one too many run-ins with rude waitstaff. There is one person in particular with whom I have had several uncalled-for (in my opinion) encounters. This most recent time, I left a bad tip (didn't mean to--simple oversight on my part). I was told that I had apparently tipped poorly in the past as well and that if I continued to do this, I would be refused service in the future. I apologized, handed the person a few extra dollars and got out of there. As someone who also works in a tip-based industry (cab driving), I was really taken aback that someone would confront a customer about their tipping and then basically threaten not to serve them in the future because of it. Sure, not leaving 20% was my fault, but it was a surreal experience nonetheless. I've had similar encounters previously with this person as well and have heard similar stories from others, so I think I'm done at Willaby's. But that's ok, cuz the actions of their waitstaff have given me the impression that they don't want my business anyway lol..."}
{"text":"Being here makes me LOVE Sundays.  The ambiance is superb.  Old plaques on the faux wood walls, seats at the counter, multi-varied mugs, adorable hipster staff.  Same dude still works here (ur a cutie!).  Had the French Toast and still my favorite FT ever.  had a side of v-sausage, enjoyed that too. BF again had biscuits and gravy, a large and in charge plate of food. loved it.  We really like this place, really, really, really."}
{"text":"Best bacon in town.  Plus you always get 4 strips.  Other restaurants you get 3.  Nice people."}
{"text":"Loved it. I got the French toast with blueberries and it was great. But I agree with others we had to wait for 40minutes to get the food! The wait staff were nice and the other people at my table seemed to enjoy their food also. I will go there again but with a book or study material to pass my time while waiting for food."}
{"text":"I'm excited to write a review of Willalby's Cafe in Madison. As usual, my review is based on what my experience AS A VEGAN was at this establishment. 

I was eager to go to Willalby's because they came up with good ratings on Happy Cow for a place to go for vegan breakfast all day. A friend and I met there. We got a nice booth seat easily because it was around 10:30 on a beautiful Saturday in Madison. I hear its usually more crowded. It was pretty warm inside but we got used to it. 

The service was night and day. One server seemed inexplicably annoyed with us from the get go. The other couldn't have been more fun and friendly. So, we broke even I guess. At some point one of the servers and what I assume were customers who were friends broke into loud song along with one of the tunes being played. Okay, but it was a little distracting and annoying for my friend and I while we were trying to talk. I also was a little put off by seeing one of the servers puffing on a pipe in the kitchen. At least I think that is what I saw. I assume it was a vape, but can that even be allowed?? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. 

On the menu there are delicious-sounding options for us vegans like vegan french toast, tofus skillet, and vegan biscuits and gravy. Sides like vegan sausage and vegan chefs make ordering even more fun. I got the vegan biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns and vegan sausage. By the way, they can crumble the vegan sausage into the gravy, or you can just get it on the side. Ah, choices...thank you! 

The meal was spectacular. There was no question that I would be taking my leftovers home with me for a midnight snack. The coffee (of which we had 4 cups) was fresh and smooth. 

So two thank you's that I want to throw out there then. First, thank you to Willalby's for making the vegan items clear on the menu. It's breakfast, I'm sleepy, I don't want to launch into an investigation of every ingredient in every vegan-sounding dish. You didn't require me to do that and I appreciate it! Second, thank you for having some sides I can eat. It makes the dining experience so much more enjoyable when there are choices to mix and match. I can't wait to come back and try the french toast next!"}
{"text":"1.  Don't go to Willalby's for speedy service.

2.  Instead, go for the great atmosphere and the cozy, neighborhood feel.

You'll have to wait for your food and maybe even a table but that gives you and your friends more time to catch up.  Also, the counter service is great as the wait staff are friendly.

This is my go-to weekend brunch spot. There's no pretense just lots of friendly faces."}
{"text":"This place can be easy to miss. But you shouldn't!

This is a cash only breakfast diner on Willy Street. We hardly noticed it the first several times we walked by. Stopped by for a Saturday morning breakfast and we fell in love. It's a pretty low key setup. There is a lot of seating space at the bar and plenty of booths as well. They we're playing a wide range of music from classic oldies to R&B to newish pop. The coffee is strong (comes from Just Coffee). I ordered the bomblet omlette. I was really pleased with the simplicity of the omlette. I could taste all the fresh veggies. Not too cheesy and with plenty of fillings. The hash browns were a pleasure as well. Crispy but not too oily. I tried some of the corned beef hash, and I'm pretty sure I'll order a whole dish of that for myself next time.

Atmosphere-wise the staff is friendly, efficient, and upfront with how long the wait time will be if it is crowded. They have really cool wall decor and a wide selection of eclectic coffee mugs, which I thought was a nice touch. Prices are pretty affordable for the area.

All in all probably my new favorite place to get breakfast on Willy Street."}
{"text":"I read the reviews. I got service right away. The good came in a good time. The food was good not too greasy. The biscuit was not too fresh but the hash Brown was awesome! I d would there again."}
{"text":"I love little breakfast diners, and this place was no exception. Great location, service and food with a nice dose of personality. I had to chuckle when my coffee was served in a mug with a chipped up rim and a pot leaf printed on it! 

One of my new favorite breakfast places in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Thank you Nathan for breathing such vibrant life into this Willy Street institution! This morning, my Bill enjoyed the Mediterranean Omlette and I devoured my huevos rancheros. Both were very good, the service was entertaining, and the music was awesome. We got to hear some Wicked and Björk, among other, delightfully eclectic breakfast music."}
{"text":"Not at all good. The staff is really nice. But the wait for our food was ridiculously long - we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for food at 1 PM. Not that crowded. Skillets were super greasy and ovecooked. Omelettes runny and poorly made. OJ from concentrate and runny. I'm not fussy, hard to screw up breakfast. These guys did. Don't eat there."}
{"text":"There's something about this place that keeps my husband and I coming back for more every time we're in Madison and it's not just the food (which is tasty). It's very small (and kinda dirty), so be prepared to wait (outside) for a table BUT it has a great hipster but not pretentious vibe that we love. Note: they only accept cash but there's an ATM. It's a local diner nestled in a neighborhood filled with kitschy shops; so be sure to walk off your generously portioned breakfast by strolling through Willy St to shop after. Our boys each ordered pancakes, which were larger than the plates they were served on! My husband got the Willalby omelette; cheese, huge hunks of ham (not your typical tiny dice), cheese, onions, shrooms, and peppers. I had the Fair Oaks skillet with veggie sausage, yum. Lots of veggies, Swiss cheese and hash browns. Our breakfast for 4 was $32, which was reasonable. See you next time Willalby's!"}
{"text":"This place is under new management and has been cleaned up and is really awesome. Very eclectic atmosphere. Gay/queer friendly now too :) plus they are open from 11pm to 4 am thur fri sat nights!"}
{"text":"Three of us we went in this morning for brunch. I liked the diner and neighborhood feel, which is reinforced by the wood paneling on the walls and the triple nozzle milkshake maker. Prices are pretty cheap, with most breakfasts in the $5-8 range. The coffee is also pretty solid.

However, after waiting 1.5 hours for breakfast with pretty inattentive service, I'm kind of over this place. There's a difference between charming and \"we don't care.\" The biggest disappointment was when I finally got to take a bite of my Huevos Rancheros to find out that it just wasn't very good. I think part of me died today."}
{"text":"Good greasy diner for breakfast/brunch, but probably wouldn't come back here. The food is just okay here.  
- breakfast egg, bacon, cheese sandwich - toast was burned
- Pancake bigger than your head!
- French toast was okay, not great. 

The wait was the terrible part about the experience. We waited close to an hour before our food came out. They were way understaffed for the number of people seated. The waitress did her best and made the situation bearable, so kudos to her. Without her we would have probably just left."}
{"text":"Eat here when I can. Always good food and coffee. Nice place to hang out with friends on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Super delicious, diner-style breakfast. The pancakes as big as boogie boards and come slathered in delicious butter and syrup. We ordered 2 and could finish about a third of them. We also got a scrambler, with eggs, potatoes, meats, etc. that was spot on. Even on a busy Saturday there was no wait for the counter and the staff was super friendly, funny, and awesome. It reminds me of New York diners in the best way."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood greasy spoon! 

Yes, you will have to wait for your food but the atmosphere is so welcoming and laid-back that hanging out on a lazy morning is no chore. Plus, everybody that works here is super nice. Huge pancakes (with blueberries!), awesome scramblers, Just Coffee, affordable prices, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Bryan Adams and vegan options. If you like the neighborhood and you want cheap breakfast, duh."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot for a Sunday morning breakfast after a long day of celebrating a Badger win.  Cash only, tiny, neighborhood diner.  I loved that the (strong and delicious) coffee came in random, mismatched mugs and that the 70's era wood paneled walls were covered in random flea market type artwork. Seriously!  It just gives it a kind of cool vibe.  I ordered the Willalby omelette, which was awesome (eggs, ham, green pepper, mushrooms, etc).  And huge - enough to satisfy even the most hungover sports fan.  My husband got the french toast, which also was completely amazing (from the one bite he let me steal).  Everything was reasonably priced...between four people we got out of there for less than $50.  Food is good, but the atmosphere is even better."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a super late brunch (1 pm) so the place was empty. Sometimes I feel like when I walk into an empty establishment close to closing the staff gets a little knackered...but the adorable waiter seemed delighted we were there! 

I had the vegan biscuits & gravy and they were hands down the best I've ever had, including non-vegan. SO flavorful, not too salty, just incredibly rich and filling. There were tomatoes & broccoli sprinkled on top which was a delicious addition. The hash browns that came on the side were also incredible--crispy on the outside & soft on the inside!

All in all, a cute place with friendly staff and delicious breakfast. Perfect to start off your day on Willy St."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but I really adore this place. It's a standard diner, but with a Madison twist. 

It's fairly small with only a handful of booths, but I haven't had troubles getting a booth on Monday early afternoons. There's a lot of small things here and there that really makes the place feel loved. 

The menu is small, but fantastic. I prefer the BEST sandwich. It's a little on the smaller side, but it's cheap and it's the perfect amount of food for me. They also have this vegan biscuits and gravy meal. The gravy is a sort of mushroom based gravy. My boyfriend and I were really curious about it and ordered a side of it. It's weirdly phenomenal. It doesn't really taste like a traditional gravy, but it more than makes up for it in tastiness. It's hard to describe, but I'd highly recommend it. I'm tempted to put it on my BEST sandwich as a sort of sauce. The omelets are good. The hash browns are perfect to me. Crisp on top and a mushy on the inside. I'm starting to think there isn't a bad option on the menu. The coffee is above average for a diner. Soda comes in cans.

I adore the server that's in on Mondays. He's a peach! I'm usually half asleep and just rolled out of bed, but he still goes out of his way to be cheery. He makes mornings seem better.

The food isn't the best thing I've ever had (not that it's bad, at all), but there's something to be said about the environment. It's just this great comfy, happy diner in the middle of Madison. It's a great place to start the day, wake up, and sip some coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall.
Small neighborhood place doing homestyle cooking well. Just be prepared to wait for it ..... 30 plus minutes from ordering seems standard. Bottomless coffee to kill the time .
My last visit - seemed like some  regular's orders got bumped ahead ; not saying - just saying

Place has old college apt feel with  mismatched plates and mugs but daamn good coffee, music and most key -  breakfast !
Enjoyed  omelets and their  hash is top notch.
Pancakes size of manhole covers and  taasty. Only downer-  genuine WI maple syrup is buck extra."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came in for a late breakfast as many tables were getting up. The dining area was at maybe a third capacity and our two omelets still took 40 minutes. Our server was pleasant enough, the place was clean and our food was pretty decent but I definitely became  \"hangry\" during that 40 minutes. As far as the price, quality and wait: I would go to Lazy Jane's over Willalby's in the future."}
{"text":"Came in for hangover brunch. Was not disappointed (queasy and headache-y, but not disappointed). Great staff and great food at a reasonable price. Bit of a wait for your food but worth it. Cash only!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!  It is my favorite breakfast place in all of Madison!!!  My favorite thing is the french toast...I crave this stuff!!!  The potatoes are excellent, I like mine with cheese and onions and everything is always cooked to perfection!!!  Everyone I have taken here and loved the food and had no complaints!!!  An added bonus is that I moved a half a block away about 3 months ago, so now if I could I would give it 6 stars!!!  I definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership and two new changes make the HUGEST difference in the quality of the food: the grill is regularly cleaned and the ingredients are fresh. The menu is essentially the same as far as I can tell, with the same low prices, but I have trouble convincing friends how much better the food tastes! Mainly because for the last handful of years we could only brave the place when hangovers had numbed our tastebuds. Now the food is good, the coffee is great, the grill is clean and there's a friendly face in the kitchen. Love it!"}
{"text":"Oh, Willalby's - you were a trip. Three stars for my particular visit with a potential for four overall. 

I stopped in for a weekday breakfast midmorning. There was one server and one person in the kitchen. It took awhile for the server to come over to take our order, but no big deal. I landed on hot chocolate, a pancake, and hash browns with American cheese. 

The server came back with a giant mug and let me know that they were almost out of hot chocolate mix but she improvised with some chocolate syrup. I appreciate the effort but it turns out hot water and chocolate syrup don't mix and the taste is not very pleasant. I wasn't able to let our server know, though, because she only stopped back once to drop off food and the mug hadn't cooled enough to pick up to try. 

My pancake was great - as big as a dinner plate and thin with crispy edges. No complaints there. My hash browns were also done well, except they came with cheddar instead of American. I'm not sure if it was a mixup or if American wasn't an option - the server didn't mention anything when I asked for American cheese and if that wasn't possible I'd have appreciated a head's up. 

While we were waiting for our food someone came in for a pickup order and left a small tip. The server spent the next minute or two loudly mocking the person to the entire restaurant. \"Oh, wow! A whole dollar! Gee, whatever will I do with these riches?\" Not her exact wording, but the gist of it - very sarcastic and clearly voicing her displeasure. It was kind of funny but also kind of inappropriate. 

It took a long time for her to come with our bill after we had finished eating, and while the service didn't warrant a 20% tip I can assure you I left one anyway (I almost always do, if not more, but I was hyper-conscious of being called out to the remaining patrons after I left). Effective for the server, but doesn't really make me want to come rushing back. I also chose not to mention my hot chocolate at the end of the meal - it sat there full but I wasn't asked about it, nor was it taken off the bill but after the tip rant I didn't think complaining about my drink was wise. 

Long story short this is a neighborhood joint with no lack of customers - whether you're treated well or not there's always going to be someone else coming in the door. Plus their pancakes are legit, so to be honest I'd probably put up with the lack of service for the perfect pancake."}
{"text":"I checked out a review of this place before hitting it up (vegan breakfast fare can be dicey to say the least) and was pleased to see they offer a Tofu skillet plus Vegan Biscuits and Gravy. Because the omnipresent \"tofu scramble\" is wearing a bit thin, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy because... why the hell not. I was with four hungry dudes who each ordered some variation of eggs and sausage yet they were all drooling when my plate was brought out. Zing!

The biscuits were suuuper hearty (I couldn't eat again until, like, 7 pm) and smothered in a bland gravy. I loaded on the hot sauce which helped but I still felt they were lacking in flavor. The plate came with hash browns and some chopped tomatoes and broccoli. I give Willalby's points for effort, but my meal wasn't superb.

As for the guys' meals-- they were hungover and left highly satisfied. I heard that the sausage far surpassed nearby Lazy Jane's and the eggs were done well."}
{"text":"New Years Day, Lazy Jane's is packed to the gills with brunchers, so we decide to go up the street to Willalby's. We slide into a booth, and a harried looking waitress tells us the food will take about 40 min. Ok, no prob. I split a Bomblet omelet with my bf and his friend orders the French toast. One crossword puzzle later, 40 minutes on the dot, our food arrives. Boom. The omelet was super delicious what with the basil and tomato and BUTTER. Anyway, if you're an Austin transplant, this would be roughly the equivalent of Kerbey Lane. Or Magnolia Cafe. Except not open 24/7. 

Expect mismatched silverware, kitschy mugs obtained from a thrift shop, tons of hipsters, and the best fucking omelet in Madison."}
{"text":"Feel good food with feel even better prices! The food we had, for the prices we paid, was fantastic, especially considering they use real butter, fresh locally grown produce when possible and fair trade coffee too. They even offer some vegan meals. We got our food fast. Now open for breakfast and lunch only. I read a few reviews by some \"never happy with anything\" kind of people who seem to expect the heavens to open up and gift them $15 worth of food when they are only paying $7 a meal. We found the portions to be hearty, tasty and of great value. The instant you walk in the wait staff is extremely friendly and makes you feel right at home. This area of Madison is very safe and trendy. My wife and myself love Willalby's cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast anytime. Also has vegan options that are tasty. Very reasonable pricing. Service was friendly and excellent."}
{"text":"Not much to say - it's a cute little cafe, good and simple food and great location! Will always come here for their breakfast whenever I'm in Madison - their pancakes are the biggest things I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"There are few diners I've ever experienced that hit all the marks, while also being Paul Mitchell approved, but this is my new favorite breakfast place and I've only been here once. 

*Chef- Gordon Ramsey himself would be trembling in fear if he tasted the food put out by this culinary assassin 
*Decor- 5 shining and glitter embossed gold stars
*Hair game- über niche-niche fab 
*Service- fan-freaking-tastic
*taste- 73 times better than a unicorn taking your virginity on prom night

Food recommendation- The Fair Oaks Skillet, or anything the gentleman with the most well conditioned hair I've ever witnessed in real life recommends."}
{"text":"I finally found my pancake heaven. 
The \"as big as your face\" claim is true, and on top of that, it's darn tasty. 
Another bonus is the relatively quiet scene. This is not Lazy Jane or Monty's, and certainly no waiting line (yet). You show up, slide yourself into one of the booths, and a super nice waitress will come serve you fast.

Everyone is just having a chill morning with nice breakfast - that's the Sunday morning scene I'd vote for. 

And, they have vegan French toast! I was skeptical at first, but it is actually great :)"}
{"text":"Great little diner!

We ate here on a whim after moving to Madison, and we were very surprised with the laid back atmosphere and the super nice staff! Great food (I tried the vegan french toast, I'm not vegan, and it was GREAT), great staff and great \"old time diner\" feel. My favorite neighborhood cafe, by far. 

Make sure you bring cash, though. They don't accept cards."}
{"text":"a wonderful neighborhood place to do crossword puzzles and drink great coffee.

vegetarian sausage? why yes, yes i will."}
{"text":"There are a few things that bum me out about Willaby's. 
1. They recently adjusted their hours and I won't be able to wander in there at 1am this Saturday. 
2. The wait seems like forever. It probably only took twenty minutes for our food to arrive this Saturday, but it felt like an eternity. 
3. I hate smelling like a hash brown. You leave and you smell like breakfast all day. 

I'm willing to look past these things because the food is mmm, mmm good. Butter. Lots of butter. And cheese, lots of cheese. I opted for something without much of either (eggs/toast/hash) and really dug my meal and didn't mind that it was under 7 bucks either! I hear when they're busy, plan to wait even longer for food, but it's totes worth the wait. The place is classic. Solid in every way. Though they can probs benefit from another cook because one person has a hard time plating a restaurant's worth of food. If you're a coffee drinker, they fill up pretty fun mugs with java. Get one! Snap a pic and post it like Tom Q!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Willalby's a second chance since Lazy Janes had a 30 minute wait for a table. Willalby's was even worse. We got in, ordered, and then we waited an hour for our food. How hard is it to make some eggs and potatoes? The waiter said, \"Oh, I forgot to tell you we had a wait,\" but the place wasn't that busy. Anyway, the food was okay, but definitely not worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"I know - cash only - grumble, grumble. But it's definitely worth a trip to the ATM to enjoy breakfast at this diner. The vegan biscuits and gravy were a good pick, and my dining partner really enjoyed his Denver skillet. The coffee was also really good and in your own personalized mug, just like home. I was nervous about the service based on other Yelp reviews, but we had wonderful service. Being only one waiter, I was impressed by how quickly and pleasantly he moved through the restaurant attending to everyone's needs. I would definitely return to this reasonably priced breakfast option next time I'm visiting Madison."}
{"text":"I love being able to come to a regular diner with regular people but order vegan food like the special snowflake that I am. Yes, please. Vegan biscuits and gravy were amazing. It's just a cool diner. The food is simple, greasy, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great diner on Willy Street! Went here after finding out Lazy Janes wasn't serving breakfast (after 11). Willalby's serves breakfast all day.

Pancakes are solid, omelette are amazing. Try the Hart's Content! The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the coffee. Not so good either of the three times I've been there. But very good diner (and cheap!) that I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Really small simple food. I really like their breakfast though. They have achieved that really satisfying state of grease taste and happy foodliness.m
The servers are all pretty good. Friendly (some more than others) and effective. They don't poach eggs but they don't poach endangered species either so  guess it all works out for the betterment of the universe."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a Saturday brunch for the first time and was really pleased!  First thing to know: Cash only.  The waiter was friendly and advised us that the pancakes were huge and you didn't really need two. Well, he was right; the banana nut pancake was as large as a pizza and and the biggest pancake I've ever seen.  I also had a skillet (classic wisco combination of sausage, potato, mushroom, green pepper, cheese and eggs).  There were some vegan options: skillets made w/ herbed tofu and also french toast made vegan. Total was $11.25 for pancake&skillet.  Will go back."}
{"text":"The setting is like hipster diner as it gets. Rummage sale coffee mugs and not a big staff. The wait for the food was about 37 mins.

Best HOLY SHIT!! The food was soooo good.

Got the Tofu Skillet, Vegan Biscuits and Gravy, and Vegan French Toast. Each of these gets an easy 5/5. Can not rave enough about this place! 

 It is well worth the wait. If you are in Madison and dont try this place, you are missing out."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's tiny, but I've never had to wait and there are always others. The good is exactly what you want with a local diner and the pancakes are huge.  The staff is amazing. There seem to be around four different servers who will take care of the entire place, and they do it with ease. The music is often a touch too loud and slightly heavy for me in te morning, but it's not too much of a distraction because they're mostly good tunes. I heard this place used to have hours that catered to bar-time crowds (which would be awesome) but they no longer do. As expected, it's cash only. I'll continue to spend time here and I don't want to tell people about it, because I'd rather keep it a secret."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place!

I went here for breakfast this morning and was very happy. It is very hard to find a breakfast/cafe on Williamson street that is also child friendly, but this is it.

The server was great, very informative, and was even kind with my daughter. She showed us where the children's toys were, and even put on a little puppet show for her. 

I had the veggie sandwich, my friend had one with bacon and spinach, and they made a mini pancake for my little one. I tried all three, and they were delicious.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for fast, cheap, and child friendly restaurant. I am stoked I was able to find a place in my neighborhood that my daughter and I can share breakfasts together.

UPDATE:

The new servers are super rude and really aggressive. I went in with a party of five, around 10am. There were barely any tables, so we decided to wait. If you have been here before, you would know that there is no room to wait. If all tables are full, wait outside. We were all crammed as far back as possible, but still we were told we were in the way. I asked where a good place to wait would be, and I got a fast a cold, \"Outside\" from her. 

So yeah, since I am a server, I forgave this, everyone has a bad day :) We went outside, but my pregnant cousin really didn't want to sit on the sidewalk, so I went back in with her to wait. This must have upset the server, as she gave me a nasty look. 

The two large tables by the windows were full, one table was completely done eating, and the other, almost. I could tell by the amour of sugar packets on the table that was finished that we may be there a while. 

After about 15 minutes of waiting, my family got anxious. I politely asked the server how long the wait would be, in which she replied,\"We are busy, look around, when a table opens, you are next.\"  

Here comes the topping on the cake: I looked over my shoulder again at the finished table, and turned back. Withing a few seconds, the female cook came out of the kitchen and yelled at me for harassing her guests. I was shocked. I asked her what she was talking about and she said she saw me talking to that table and she would tell me when a table opened. I can only assume she thought I was rudly telling them to leave, or possibly asking when they would be done. Either way, no words were exchanged with said table.

It sucked that my family was in town and I had to put them through that experience after telling them what a great place it was.

I like the skinny chef who l think is the owner, he makes bomb ass pancakes. If I go there again though, I hate to say I will have to peek in the window to see who is working before I ever step foot in there again :("}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I love going to Willalby's for vegan french toast and biscuits and gravy. Thanks for making tasty vegan food :)

We have also taken family to breakfast here. They enjoy the other selections on the menu as well. So the food is good for both veggies and meat-eaters!"}
{"text":"Great old diner, with counter seating and everything.  Super nice staff.  Went for breakfast.  For the vegans they have french toast and biscuits & gravy. The hash browns and veggies sausage are also vegan.  Pretty good food too, especially for the price.

BTW, Cash only!"}
{"text":"While ingenuity is appreciated, it's oftentimes best to abide by the classics. And it doesn't get much more classic than a big a** plate of Chocolate Chip Pancakes at Willalby's.

This hole-in-the-wall diner kills it in terms of cheap, no frills breakfast fare. It's safe to order just one pancake here because it'll come out the size of your head, plus some. 

The Chocolate Chip Pancake is necessary -- an ordinary pancake will not do. The generous portion of chocolate will softly melt into the thin, dense cake in a way that will make you smile. Then add to this beautiful creation a massive amount of fluffy whipped cream, soft butter and just enough syrup to the point where your pancake is drowning in glorious calories. 

That is happiness on a plate right there I want me some more."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last month and it was great both times. French toast is great and cheap. Huevos rancheros were some of the best I've ever had. The beans were so creamy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The staff is super friendly. Expect a wait during prime breakfast hours. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"This is a small diner with real home-cooked food with vegetarian and vegan options and a kitschy decor. 
Don't expect for this to be immediate gratification experience. The good things in life take time. Get there early for the chocolate chip pancakes!"}
