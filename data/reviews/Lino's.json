{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood bar, with exceptional wings.  And dont call the cute and friendly bar-gal 'Sara'."}
{"text":"Lino's is my favorite place to get wings. The Cajun and Six Pepper dry rubs are my favorites. It's a townie bar, and it feels like one, but if you want good wings and cheap drinks it's about the best thing around. I have brought a lot of people to Lino's and I don't think any of them were disappointed."}
{"text":"worst service ever

Bartenders demand music and say that anyone who has a problem with it can suck a d**k and then expect a tip. First off tip is pour drinks the same all the time first one was way 2 strong the others were weak and shots pre bottled.. instead of just mixing liquors on demand... hmmm

left a 2$ tip and was confronted personally in a group of 13 ... if you wanted a tip then don't go over customers and also don't confront customers EVER that's a rule in Retail also if you wanted a tip that is not a tip that is called Gratuity"}
{"text":"The bartenders are the worst. Always rude. Don't care about helping you and act as though you are bugging them."}
{"text":"The Steak salad was okay.  The egg was overdone and the steak was chewy. First place I've been that they charged for the dressing.  Was only expecting to be charged for the extra one, was charged for both.  The wings were delicious. They lived up to their reputation."}
{"text":"I go to Lino's from time to time for lunch or an early dinner.  I have always had great service & the bar staff are polite & attentive!  :)"}
{"text":"I was there twice . First time was fir a nieces bday party. Very young barmaids who wouldn't wait on us. Stayed by the young guys to flirt. So want impressed at that time but next was for a friends wake. It was not a Friday or Saturday so none of that flirting crap going on and they did a nice job . I wouldn't run back there"}
{"text":"Local bar and kitchen. Jason gave great service. Had slider basket. So good. Must try. They have a decent menu but also have specials.."}
{"text":"First time trying Linos and it was great. The wings are phenomenal and some of the best I've ever had. The wings are bigger than usual and filling. Definitely would recommend and I would go back."}
{"text":"Lino's is funny.  Its like a wannabee night club on the weekends but not many people show up....except me of course.  It has a long bar and lots of table seating.  They put up a heated butt hut for you smokers during the winter months.  Lot's of beers on tap and they serve a full menu.  I have only gotten deep fried goodies there and their mussels once.  Its what you would expect when walking into a place like this. 

They have Keno and a juke, I also think they may have scratch-offs but you might not want to take my word on that one.  They do have a couple dart boards, steel tip, and I think there is also a pool table, yeah, pretty sure there is.  They also have a patio but I don't see that being used that much during the summer.  

I like Lino's, hell, I might go there this weekend.  I'll be the guy at the bar with my feet kicked up on the stool next to me with a big smile on my face."}
