{"text":"This place is awesome! New ownership and renovated! The food is great, the plates are decorated with art veggies, the crew is super and the prices are very reasonable!  This place is not the old dirty restaurant that it was years ago. You need to give it a try."}
{"text":"In my opinion, hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. The restaurant is under new management, the food is quick and delicious! We ordered the drunken noodles with seafood, crispy shrimp with creamy sauce, and the crab ragoons. Everything was on point! The owner Nathan is also a super nice guy and very accommodating! Definitely gonna recommend to my friends, and come back more often!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Asian food in Arizona hands down... great service... great atmosphere... and really some authentic cuisines that you wouldn't expect to find in Mesa"}
{"text":"Nathan, the new owner, has done a fantastic job of revitalizing the physical look as well as infusing some new dishes into the menu. No longer a cheap buffet, this restaurant offers ambiance equivalent to that of places charging 2 to 3 times as much. The food is great and the service makes me feel like a valued customer every time. Tonight's server, Ryan doesn't loom but is always present just before I need her; filling water, checking our experience and being ever so attentive, what more could I ask?"}
{"text":"We visited with a large group on a Saturday night for dinner. Ambiance was a mix of traditional Thai and modern. The live background guitar music added to a pleasant evening. My wife and I ordered the Beef Drunken Noodles and Chicken Spicy Eggplant. The flavors and spice levels were spot on for our entrees. The portion sizes should be larger for the dinner prices. Service was friendly and attentive from beginning to end. The owners and servers checked back with the group to ensure they were satisfied with our meals."}
{"text":"We went to Pink Pepper Asian Fusion tonight for dinner. It has new owners so we thought we would try it again. We were so surprised how good the food was. Everything tastes fresh, customer service was excellent. We had an appetizer of Crab Rangoon, then for entrees we had Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp...excellent and fresh. We also had Chicken with Mixed Vegetables, we could not believe how fresh and perfect these dishes were. We had Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert..another hit. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is good!! Their sticky rice mango is the bomb!! The people are very nice, not the same with the old pink pepper."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for an early Saturday night dinner.  At 5:30 there were only four other people in the restaurant. We started with Mai Tais and coconut shrimp. A great combination to kickoff a wonderful meal. Our entrees were the Mussaman Curry with chicken and the Pan Fried Noodles with chicken. Both dishes were delicious and the generous portions have us both looking forward to lunch tomorrow. Many of the reviews rave about the mango sticky rice dessert. It's all true. Perfectly ripened, masterfully sliced mango paired with warm sticky rice sitting in a bit of coconut sauce will make you glad that you decided to take home a portion of your entree.  By the time we left, the tables were starting to fill up. Even with the growing crowd the dining room was not noisy. The live acoustic guitarist could still be easily heard strumming The Girl From Impanema. If you find yourself in Mesa near Dobson and Guadalupe, Pink Pepper Asian Fusion should be one of your stops."}
{"text":"Bomb. Ate till it hurt and then some. New favorite Thai place. Drunken noodles, chicken satay, crab Rangoon and masaman curry."}
{"text":"Wow! Totally redone. Great atmosphere. Delicious food with lovely presentation. Generous portions typical of Asian restaurants. Happy hour until 7."}
{"text":"Love the newly decorated interior and the new food selection. I tried the pad thai and volcano shrimp. It was really delicious. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"New owners, new menu! My wife and I stopped by, unsure if the Pink Pepper was just rebranding, or was a whole new restaurant. Turns out the only thing that's the same is the sign on the side of the building, and that's a good thing!  We had the yellow curry with chicken. It's not too spicy, with a lime accent in the sauce. We also had the Satay platter and fried dumplings which were tasty.  If you're a local and you were steering clear of the old Pink Pepper, stop by and give the new place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great pad Thai and lemon chicken. Great environment and music. Chicken is crispy and plates are organized well like a classy restaurant would."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian food in Az! I would recommend it for everyone! The owner is awesome!!! Makes the best food and clean environment!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We've eaten here twice with a large group of 12-18 people.  They pulled tables together and service was great.  Both times we had 2-3 servers taking care of our table, getting refills, etc.  The food is delicious.  The General Tso's is very good and my wife liked the Broccoli Chicken.  Plates come with a large amount of food and bowl of rice on the side.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The new ownership has done wonders with this restaurant. The ambience is nice and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, I honestly don't know why is not full of customers.   Great food, I had the mixed stir fried veggies added some shrimp, everything was fresh. I love it when all the vegetable are crispy.   By the way I'm writing this to remind myself to come back.  I would of taken a picture but I ate it all."}
{"text":"If you live in the Dobson Ranch area and you haven't been in to check out the new and very improved Pink Pepper , you definitely should! I found a buy one get one free coupon in the junk mail and figured why not give the place another shot . It was awesome! The inside looks 100% better , the foods great and the service is very good."}
{"text":"I've come down with a horrible cold and went to pink Pepper for some soup. Lovely girl that helped me was so kind and left me a note in my to go order. Delicious soup and that sweet note will make me a returning customer over and over again."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch.  This place is a gem.  We had Pho Noodle soup and crab fried rice.  We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Delicious, Clean, Great service.  Food not only tastes amazing but looks beautiful too.  Loved it !!"}
{"text":"Super great food , try the crispy shrimp in spicy cream sauce, yum yum in my tum tum !"}
{"text":"We had never been here before tonight and we are coming back!  You need to try the Egg Flower soup!  It's absolutely  delicious!  There food is made for YOU when you order!  No pre made food!  The veggies in all of our dishes were cooked perfectly!  The service was great and the place is very pretty inside!  Recommend!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were both a little under the weather late one evening and wanted to get some nourishing soup. I found Pink Pepper Asian Fusion on Yelp and was drawn to it because it doesn't close until 9:30 on weekdays unlike the typical 9PM for most restaurants. As we walked in, we were impressed by the interior design. There was a plethora of authentic Asian artwork and ornate statues which were tasteful displayed throughout the restaurant.   Our server from Thailand was so gracious and friendly. He even invited us to return on our birthday and that the meal would be on the house. I had the pho and my husband had the sizzling rice soup. The pho totally hit the spot with incredible flavors. We were both in awe of the sizzling rice soup which came out as a hot broth filled with veggies and shrimp then a plate of crispy rice was tossed into the bowl emitting a a loud sizzle! It was delicious! We completed the meal with the most beautifully presented mango sticky rice!   I was so satiated from the meal that as I wiped my mouth, I couldn't wipe off my smile!   We had such a great experience that we brought 4 friends back with us the next day. All of them were also blown away by the quality of the dishes. The spicy drunken noodles were a huge hit among my friends and it definitely was as authentic as anything you'd find in Thailand! This will be my go to for Thai food in the future! :)"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! The interior remodeling is great and the food is outstanding! Pan fry noodle was excellent and the best  Pho I've tried and I've had it at 5 different places. They're bringing an authentic Thai chef to prepare the meals...you've gotta make a trip out and taste it yourself. You're gonna love it!! I can't wait to experience additiinal dishes."}
{"text":"After trying almost every Thai restaurant around, I decided to finally give Pink Pepper a try.  Walking in, I noticed the space is pretty clean and nice. Definitely a good environment with respectable presentation.   I decided to order the green curry lunch special with chicken. That's kind of my baseline dish for a a good Thai restaurant. It came with a soup, which was fairly tasty and quite spicy. Wasn't amazing, but above average for sure.  The spring roll was also crispy and fresh, as was the fried rice. The curry however was not as good as I was hoping it to be. I ordered a 4 out of 5 spiciness, which it most definitely was. I give them props for actually being hot when you order hot. Many restaurants are not like that.  My problem with the curry was that 1) It was too salty, and 2) it was too oily. It didn't have that complex undertone of basil and spices that I love in a good green curry. Also, it wasn't very green. More brownish than green. I will say that the vegetables were plentiful and fresh. I loved the giant chunks of eggplant in it.   All in all, I rate it above average. Not great, but decent. The server was very friendly and attentive. Again, I had no problems with anything except the curry itself. I feel like if they honed the complexity and flavor profile, it has the potential to be a great dish.  For now though, nothing can beat Soda Bun's curries - at least around here."}
{"text":"Excellent service and options for heat level. NOT the old Pink Pepper!  Yes, worth going to. Plenty of food for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great Asian Food - came from Denver and have Been looking for some great Asian food and I've found it - Pink Pepper Asian Fusion is great Asian food"}
{"text":"The new version of Pink Pepper has potential, if it can decide what it wants to be.  Does it want to be an upscale Asian fusion dining experience, suggested by the professional waitstaff, gleaming bar, high-end decor, soft jazz music and higher-end prices?   Or does it want to be another West Mesa hole-in-the-wall family Chinese place, suggested by the tacky smoothie posters on the window, shouting, running children and really average food?  Right now, if they want to be upscale, the food is just not there. It's $8-an-entree being sold for $12. I'm happy to pay $12 at Green Tea Bistro or Thai Spices, two of Mesa's best Asian dinner spots. But here, we have Thai food being cooked like Chinese (no heat options, for example) and I'm not sure I'd call the result \"fusion\". It was okay. I ate it. It would be honestly be fine for Friday-night takeout in front of the TV, but that's not what I'm paying for, and I sense that the owner didn't want me to have that impression.  There is time to fix -- above all, give us gourmet flavors, no cutting corners. Seat families with children away from couples trying to have an intimate dinner (there was plenty of room). Our service was top-notch, professional and fast, so keep that going. Remove everything downscale about your place; there's enough great downscale Chinese in Mesa (Beijing Noodle House) and you're not going to win there at your price point.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Ordered the pork pad thai. Sadly, the pork was not seasoned well and the portion was very small. For $12 I would expect amazing flavors or a larger portion, and I got neither."}
{"text":"Brand new owners and new menu. Very delicious and fresh food. The owners are very nice and take pride in their dishes. We ordered the Fresh Basil Roll, Pad See Ew and Crispy Curry Duck, all 3 were excellent. Give this place a try:)"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and figured I try it out. It's one of my favorite places. The dumplings are delicious. They taste fresh, and not frozen, which is always a nice surprise. I also get the Chinese fried rice with beef. If I order in house, or get it to go, it's always delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy writing less than 4 or 5 star reviews.  However, usually \"fusion\" restaurants fuse things that usually don't go together and that's what makes them unique.  Chinois does Chinese & French.  Chinese and Thai isn't what I'd call fusion.  We went there for dinner tonight and the food was lackluster.  There were four of us and no one finished more that half of their meal. I had the Mongolian beef...it tasted like beef bulgogi.  Not what I was looking for. Unfortunately too many Asian restaurants around for me to try them again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - exceptional service and food.  One of our favorite Asian fusion restaurants anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Their Thai tea is amazing!!! Also got their pad Thai and some fried rice with a soup. They bring your food out with minimal wait. The taste and temperature is always good. I have no complaints and would definitely come back because i Love Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I had the Pad Thai and the crab Rangoons, both were really great. Everything was fresh; the service was prompt and friendly; I couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Pink Pepper checks all boxes when it comes to Asian Fusion cuisine.  The staff (owner) are top notch and there to serve the customer. The decor is Asian Fusion indeed. With elements of Thailand, Japan, China, and Vietnam. The Pink Pepper is beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and a wonderful dining experience all around. Did we mention the food? The food is as eclectic and meticulously prepared as the surroundings. Give Pink Pepper a try."}
{"text":"Flavorful food. Fried rice was outstanding. Seafood tom yum soup wasn't too fresh, but still decent. Curries were very good. Smoothies seemed to have more milk/cream than fruit but still tasted decent."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and spicy and crash.  The service was excellent I'm going back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service, GREAT food! Went during happy hour and was pleasantly surprised by the bill. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing it is under new ownership. We've been looking for a new dinner spot and this is near our home. Really liked the atmosphere, really serene. We were seated quickly. I ordered a Thai tea, it was great, a prefect balance of the cream and tea. We had the Singapore noodle and drunken noodles and split an order of the pineapple fried rice. The Singapore noodles had a nice mild curry flavor and the veggies were cooked just right, with just enough crunch. The drunken noodles were spicy but packed with flavor, the pineapple fried rice was perfect to calm the spice when needed. Really enjoyed our meal, received great service and will be adding this place to our dinner date rotation."}
{"text":"The coconut milk soup with shrimp was fabulous; The Thai Beef Salad was the Best!  All of our choices were great. My husband lived in Thailand for a year so he knows his Thai Food.  He thinks this is the best Thai Restaurant in the area and we will return soon!"}
{"text":"My family and i went really early before the dinner rush, the items were really good. The staff was really nice , the bill was over $100.00. I went once and i probably wont go back, i think i could get the same quality food for cheaper. But none the less i am happy i went."}
{"text":"5 of us stopped here after work for happy hour. We had a wonderful time. The drinks were a good price and so were the appetizers.   They started us off with yummy egg drop soup and wonton chips as soon as we sat down. Can't beat that!  The Nam Sod Chicken salad was so delicious and flavorful. I'd have it again! We also had the satay chicken and beef. The dipping sauce was good. The owners were very nice and friendly. The place looks great. Next time, I'll definitely have to sit at the lovely bar.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ambiance, the staff & owners are awesome. Extensive menu and the food is very good. Would recommend to anyone who likes Thai food as well as those who may not be familiar with the wonders of Thai."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. And the delivery was quickly. No was grease food. Healthy nd delicious"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out from here and it was really good! Portion size was decent for the lunch special and I liked that it came with an egg roll. I also liked being able to order online. I'm a picky pregnant lady so it was nice being able to see exactly what ingredients were in each dish and pick out what I didn't like."}
{"text":"I decided to try something different to order in besides Domino's up the street (don't judge me!) I turned to Yelp for some nearby delivery suggestions and Pink Pepper popped up as one of my bookmarks.   Food was delivered for $2 delivery charge--what?! They got my order right, delivered it warm, and on time! Boom! Easy. Thanks Yelp for making ordering food from your app seamless. Step one done.   On to step two. The grub. I literally could not stop myself from eating. Ignored all my hunger cues and just indulged myself. The crispy shrimp in cream sauce and pineapple fried rice was ah-mazing!!! Portion sizes generous, pricing reasonable. Spice level is REAL folks, so if you ain't used to heat, I suggest going with mild or none. I ordered medium spice and I was fine, but hubby had to take a break and broke out in a little sweat lol.   I think I just found my new favorite local Asian Fusion. Looooove it. Thank you Pink Pepper, please don't ever leave me! :)"}
{"text":"You can not go wrong with this place! The food is excellent!!! Tons of vegetarian or non-veg options. My server Vava was the best she heard me coughing and brought me hot water, how sweet! I will definitely return. The lunch specials are awesome and the decor is amazing! The service is top notch too!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. It came very quick but there was nothing special about it. We ordered the general tsos chicken, chow mein, and pad thai. The pad thai was the best dish we tried, but it was dry...the chow mein was flavorless and oily and the general tsos chicken was really mushy and not authentic. The sauce tasted watered down. I wouldn't order from here again unless it was free."}
{"text":"Thai food here is not good.  I ordered Thai Red Curry with Chicken.  I was served a curry with  ingredients in Mussaman Curry, Potatoes , Onions and Carrots. It did  not taste like Mussaman curry either. When I enquired they told they just grabbed the incorrect ingredients. Seemed to care little that this was mistake that should have been fixed. The old Pink Pepper was a  genuine Thai restaurant. The spice level is in the new fusion restaurant also does not compare to Thai standards. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We finally stopped in to try this place & the service was good & the food was great! We had Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai & yellow curry. We will definitely be going back. We were surprised it wasn't packed busy when we went in... especially after we got our meal & were happy with whole experience."}
{"text":"The service was really slow and server had no idea of the menu. I ordered curry noodle soup and Taco Bell mild sauce would have been hotter and the soup was broken. (Separated)."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service, and the atmosphere. Our server went through the whole menu with us as we had never had Thai food before. She recommended dishes and brought us some Thai iced tea to sample. Awesome place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and easily the best Mai Tai's in Mesa! And the Chiang Mai Noodle dish with red curry, chicken, veg and rice noodles was delicious."}
{"text":"Was here for a Sunday brunch. Great ambience, very quiet place. Totally loved the red interiors.  Ordered - Pineapple Fried Rice : tasted delicious, not so different from any other Thai/Chinese places though. Rice was lil over room temperature, may be it would have tasted better when served hot??  My buddy liked the green curry. So i wouldn't give my final verdict until I taste few other dishes. Definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"Mango Sticky Rice has never been so nice!   A quick scroll through the photos from Pink Pepper Asian Fusion will show you that they take plating Mango Sticky Rice seriously: Thin mango slices shaped into a heart that hugs warm sticky rice that's been drowned in sauce topped with sesame seed sprinkles and a hint of mint garnish. It's delicious! If you only get one thing off the menu let it be this dessert.    Knowing that it must take a lot of care to create such a beautiful presentation for the Mango Sticky Rice -- Of course, the rest of the food on the menu is tasty as well! We've tried Coconut Shrimp, Fried Pineapple Rice, Sesame Chicken, and lunch specials of Crispy Honey Chicken and Veggie Delight, so far everything has been a real treat."}
{"text":"We were surprised to see that Pink Pepper is now under new ownership with a new approach; Asian Fusion. Not to worry. The menu had all our favorite Thai dishes and lots of Chinese favorites as well. Well be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about the change in owners. Tried it with my adult family on Friday Night. Not many customers but had a great experience. Server was very knowledgeable and helpful. Made menus suggestions when asked. Service was great and the food was outstanding. Very fresh, cooked perfectly and very hot. (Temperature)  Looks like a nice little bar area too. I will definitely return. Might make it a regular spot. Hope they can get the word out that they are new and different. And clean. Good lighting, decent sound system. Place was tired and boring under previous owners. Now it's kinda cool. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was amazing! Great shrimp tempura, yummy papaya salad with chicken and sticky rice. Crispy chicken was to die for ! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautifully remodeled. I was happy to have many meatless options. The server was lovely. I will definitely make this a regular stop. I had not been to any pink peppers for years due to feeing like it was just ok, but I am very please with this new pink pepper asian fusion. It is so nice inside too. Beautiful."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I likw the creamy spicy chicken. So damn flavorful. Place was recently taken over by new owners and they know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant in Mesa. Found this on Yelp while in the area and I am so glad this place came up on search.  Arriving past lunch hour on weekend, hardly anyone there, made me really nervous about this place.   New owner Nathan was our server and he was really friendly. They have lunch menu available even on weekend. Happy hour special is really good price too.  Lunch meal comes with soup, fried rice and egg roll. Soup on that day was Tom yum. I was actually very surprised by the quality of soup. It was so good made me want to order regular order of tom yum.  They also serve Chinese food as well as Vietnamese pho. Quite variety of dishes are on the menu, everything I tasted was very good.  Must try their famous mango with sticky rice. Mango and rice is heart shaped, it was yummy sweet. Highly recommend.  Very generous portion, left over I took home was still good later. Looking forward to coming back to try more."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch yesterday.   I knew that Gary Hostallero, world famous artist, is show casing some of his artwork on the walls, and I wanted to check it out.   BEAUTIFUL!   But what else would I expect of Gary's work.   Nathan, the new owner, waited on us.   Very friendly and helpful.   I had the Cashew Nut, and my friend had the Pad Thai, both with added chicken.   It comes with egg drop soup, which is better than most.   Loved how the flavors compliment each other.  My cashew nut entree came with an egg roll and brown rice and garnished with a bit of veggies.  I asked for a hotness of three.   Nathan says it goes up to five.  If it's a Thai restaurant, I thought I'd be cautious with the numbers.   I remember having it one time where it was so hot my lips swelled, and I could barely eat the food.   The three was a tiny bit hot.   I think four would have been perfect.  I liked the flavors of my cashew nut dish.  I ate the entree with a bit of the rice, and it was perfect.   The bell peppers and onions in the dish were not cooked till disintegration but more so than al dente.  Perfect.  Presentation was spot on.  I didn't taste my friend's dish, but she said it was really good.     She told me the restaurant had been an Asian buffet prior.   It is a very open restaurant with I think a bar in the middle.   Nathan said a musician comes in every Thursday to entertain.   If I was in that part of the valley, I am definitely going to return.   I would like to try other things on the menu as well."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and apparently newly renovated. It's been many years since I had been to this location but due to the recent changes, my boyfriend and I decided to try it out. I'm glad we did because the whole experience was surprisingly good. Everything about our experience was pleasant. I was impressed by the interior, which has a modern Asian ambiance. Floor plan was well-thought and was spacious. Food options include foods from multiple cultures. We tried few dishes, and I thought they do a pretty good job at making it authentic, rather than fusion like the restaurant's name suggests. We did get their boba drinks. I got the thai tea; I was told they make it fresh from tea leaves. Pretty cool thought. My boyfriend ordered a coconut smoothie and that was amazing!!! I'm literally drooling thinking about it. The boba itself was impressive. This is the softest boba I've ever had. It did lack a little flavor but definitely compensates with its texture. Customer service was on point. Everyone was extremely helpful, quick, and attentive. Only recommendation I have for this place is to have a dessert/drinks menu from which customers can easily choose an item. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Nicely updated interior and menu:  restaurant under new management.  Great food, attentive staff, and nice menu selection.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Thai food. I usually order the Tom Kha Ghai (coconut milk soup) and my husband the panang curry. Both are very good here (thumbs up to the cook!). We also like their spring rolls and Thai iced tea. Started coming here after their remodel/re-opening. They did a good job with the inside look of this place. Modern, clean, and elgant, this is a good place to have a meal and an intimate conversation."}
{"text":"I've been to many Thai food restaurants around the valley and this is one of my favorites now that it is under the new ownership. The food is consistently delicious, the new remodeled interior is fresh and clean, and Nathan is the most personable host/ owner; making Pink Pepper Asian Fusion a stand out among other Thai restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   This location has been Pink Pepper, with the same owner, since the 1980's, but this year, it was purchased by NEW OWNERS who are DETERMINED to do what it takes to make this restaurant great!  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I have been going to this restaurant for ages. In fact, I had my first date in this restaurant, so it holds a tiny bit of sentimentality for me, but not a lot. Suffice it to say, I've seen this restaurant from its beginnings to now.  I went in to place a to-go order and found out the place had changed completely.  I sat at the bar, talking the new owners about their story, having a delicious girly blue cocktail, whilst hearing their story.  Interestingly, their biggest issues were with name changes and branding.  Apparently, the new owner had originally wanted a new fresh name, but the property owner/leasing company said that the \"Pink Pepper\" name was an anchor name to that strip mall; therefore, they couldn't change it.  Unfortunately, some of the bad press from the previous owners came with that name, including bad Yelp reviews, that had nothing to do with the current owners.  By the time they finally got approval/the property owners acquiesced to a new name, they had already invested heavily in branding and advertising costs, so they left the name, but added \"Asian Fusion.\"  The whole time we were talking, I tried the happy hour menu. OMG THE COCONUT SHRIMP ARE SO GOOD.  I also LOVE the chicken satay with extra peanut sauce.  I took my Chicken Gang-Karee and house Pad Thai to-go.  Since that meal, I've had them deliver about 15 times.   The delivery is within a limited radius obviously and takes about 20-40 minutes. I've always been pleased with my delivery food. SUPER YUMMY!  CONCLUSION   If you're aware of the previous PINK PEPPER, it's NOW under new management. If you're not aware, just go, it's DELICIOUS.  At least that's been my experience.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *Daily Happy Hour.  *Delivery Available."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  We intended to go to the place next door but there was a massive wait.  Our server was super friendly and the food was delicious!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My family and I went in unknowingly under the new ownership and we could not have been more pleased with your entire experience. We didn't know it at first, but we were welcomed, seated, and served by the owner himself. He obviously takes great pride in his newly acquired restaurant. It shows in the beautiful new decor, the service, and the food is prepared with attention to detail in flavor and in appearance. We tried the spring rolls, egg flower soup, orange chicken, spicy asparagus chicken, and the perfectly spiced green curry. We cannot wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in years, saw it had new owners and great reviews so decided to give a shot. Oh my gosh, it was absolutely AMAZING. Started off with a beef satay that tender and the presentation was lovely.  We had the Grilled Pork with Spicy Pineapple Salsa and the Crispy Basil Duck for dinner. The Pork was so tender it melted in your mouth and the duck was tender with a spicy (a #2) but not spicy delicious sauce. Thai Iced tea was perfectly sweet but not too much so. And the finale' was the Mango Sticky Rice. DeliciousI It was  topped with a beautiful orchid. Husband said he'd go there just for the Sticky rice and he never eats desserts out. The decor is really spectacular, lots of interesting artwork and gold leaves, great lighting."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a thousand times. 2 years later I'm slapping myself for not trying it sooner. So good! There were Thai and Chinese food options. We got one of each, plus an appetizer, and Thai tea. None of it disappointed! It was all delicious, plus there was live music and an enjoyable soft atmosphere that allowed us to enjoy each other and not the noise, but also enjoy the music if we wanted to listen. What a nice place for a date!"}
{"text":"We're always looking for new places to try on the weekend. This Friday it was Pink Pepper.  I was impressed with the atmosphere. Very nice, clean, and relaxing.  The food was delicious, with lots of flavor, especially the sticky rice and mango desert. I've never seen it prepared that way. Such simple ingredients, with such a nice presentation. Just makes it taste that much better.  The service was also very good. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and very attentive. Will definitely be returning to this one."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is really groovy as well. I had the green curry and it knocked my socks off. I would recommend sandals if you plan on dining here !"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Everything was done right. Good price also. I will be coming here more often. Penang curry was perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered the papaya platter (came with chicken and sticky rice) and drunken noodles with chicken (very spicy). Papaya salad was ok but there was no pepper in the dish. Should have asked if they could make it spicy. Chicken was ok, a little on the dry side and nothing to be excited about. Sticky rice was great, no complaints there. Drunken noodles were barely spicy. I was disappointed that yet another ethnic restaurant cut back on the spices. Wish I could find an Vietnamese/Thai restaurant that was consistent and accurate with their spice level. Some of the noodles in the dish were mushy which was unappealing.  Overall it was just ok. I usually stay away from Asian fusion restaurants that have more than one asian/ethnic fusion because there is too much going on and not enough in attention put into perfecting the dishes. I will most likely go back to staying away from multiple Asian fusion restaurants again. Food wasn't great but wasn't horrible either. (I have eaten homemade and restaurant Vietnamese and Thai dishes pretty much my whole life)."}
{"text":"Wow, holiday weekend and my delivery was early and Delicious. No wonder they had good ratings.  Crab appetizer is light and flavorful. The seafood Tom Yum brings the heat and great flavor!!"}
{"text":"Very average food. The old management had great food. The Tom ka was meh and the service was not so good.  I wouldn't bother for tom ka.  Might try lunch if there's not other good options"}
{"text":"The Pink Pepper is back in my opinion!   We used to go to the Scottsdale location which closed years ago.  We found this location in Mesa and it was nothing like the original!  Now the new owner has remodeled and it is clean and open.  Nice bar if you have a wait.  The food tasted very fresh and the portions were excellent.  We will return!!  We orders Panang Curry and Crispy Chicken with Spicy Cream Sauce which are pictured."}
{"text":"I've been to several Thai restaurants across the valley. Pink Peppers would be one of the top in my list. Walking inside the restaurant, you can feel the modern vibe of the interior decoration. I ordered seafood tom yum and chicken pad thai. The soup tasted authentic with generous amount of seafood. The chicken pad thai was also very tasty. On top of that, the service was top notch! Will come back again in near future!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food I've ever had. The ambience is perfect for a romantic night on the town. The service is very attentive and very polite. The first time we came we didn't know what to expect. But when we got our food we realized we had found the best Thai food in Mesa.  We had the pad king sod and Penang curry. Nothing was overly spiced and very tasty. We also had the basil spring rolls, the presentation of everything was beautiful.  We will come back again and again and hope to bring guests with us in the future"}
{"text":"Visited this joint last week, totally new feel since my last visit. Everyone agreed the food was good but the unfortunately the service was slow. Our waiter was funny & joking with us, which was cool, but we were there for 2.5 hours because of the slow service. When we arrived I didn't see anyone else in the place. Another one or two dozen people slowly arrived but 2.5 hours for a meal?! I think they may have been understaffed -- at least I hope that was the case (I only saw 2 wait staff regularly) because I would like to try it again. As I said, no issues with the food or the drinks. Maybe we just went at a bad time ... we were there on a Saturday night, around 4:30ish."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for many years while it was still named Pink Pepper. I have to say that we really like this new transition and the management. They've kept some of the best dishes from the original Pink Pepper and now have added some wonderful Vietnamese and Chinese dishes too. My husband loves the Chinese Sichuan Chicken & my favorite is the creamy spicy chicken from the old menu. Any of their Curry dishes are wonderful. They try very hard to fulfill any special requests and the decor and service is great. They will even deliver to your home for an additional two dollars! Who gets that anymore? We really love this new transition and want to keep supporting it!"}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago and never came back.  It was literally painful.  Since then, there appears to be new ownership and a refreshing remodel.  I can't say that this is the best Thai restaurant in the USA but I can't think of any place better than the Pink Pepper!  The restaurant was clean and well put together.  The service was friendly and prompt.  The food was fresh and the flavor profiles were spot on.  If you enjoy Thai Food ... this will become part of your rotation."}
{"text":"The new owner really spruced up this space! Gone are the '80s pastel pink and blue walls and dated decor. The new interior is sleek and chic with an air of casual elegance. The menu is different too. Gone is the buffet and the selections include dishes from Thai, Vietnamese and Americanized Chinese cuisine.   Since they offer all day happy hour on Sunday we decided to eat here to try out the new menu. The happy hour menu had a good selection of items, all $5, as well as discounted beverages. I decided on the happy hour nam sod salad and a tofu green curry off their regular menu.   The nam sod salad was absolutely delicious. It was refreshing, with bright flavors and an interesting contrast between the crisp coolness of the food and the spicy heat from the chile peppers in it. It was served on a boat of lettuce with additional lettuce leaves to wrap your chopped meat and vegetable mixture in. I'd definitely get this again.  The green curry was milder in flavor and spice level than the nam sod. It was decent, but not anything I'd crave. There was plenty of tofu and vegetables in it.  The delight of our dinner service was the dessert we ordered, the mango sticky rice. It was so beautifully presented in a heart shape with a pretty little orchid perched right in the middle. The sticky rice was perfectly cooked, and it had just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. The meticulously arranged mango was very fresh and went well with the sticky rice. Did you know you can eat the orchid flower too? The server who I think was the owner mentioned that all the food he serves is made so that you can eat your entire plate.  Service was very friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.  There were a few minor mishaps with our experience here though, as we didn't have any silverware or napkins on our table nor were any provided to us after being seated. Since a neighboring empty table had them we just snagged some from that table so it wasn't a big deal. We also got charged for an extra item we didn't order on our receipt. The owner was very apologetic about it and he refunded our money in cash.   We had a nice pleasant experience here and I'd definitely go back to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"Overall, it's actually great food. The person who helped us was very accommodating and patient. I hope they get more people to eat there cause it looks always empty. I will definitely go back to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"A lot of choices on food and it is very yummy. The staff is very friendly and the place has a great atmosphere . They had a guitar player on Saturday night and it was very pleasant. Try the basil rolls!"}
{"text":"Not the place we went to last time. Not bad but not great. Beef satay very good. But nothing else special"}
{"text":"This was first trip to the Pink Pepper and.it is nowy go-to asian restaurant. I went with my wife and mother and we all really enjoyed it. I had the Egg Foo Young, which I haven't seen on a menu since moving to the valley 13 years ago and it was delicious. My wife had beef Chop Seuy and mother Cashew Nut chicken, I tasted theirs as well and it was wonderful as well.  The servers were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was up to date and very clean.  I highly recommend the Pink Pepper."}
{"text":"We had never been here before and decided to give it a try based on the recent reviews. The pan fried noodles had the right texture, but the sauce was strangely sweet. It was definitely much more of a sweet dish than a savory one; wasn't what we had expected. The broccoli beef was just OK; not really much to comment on. I LOVE sizzling rice soup and it is so hard to find! This was definitely the best thing we ordered from here. The soup was delicious! And finally of course we got the mango sticky rice; it was one of the best I have had and the presentation was beautiful."}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner & was totally impressed with the new set up. My wife & I enjoyed the food which was beautifully presented & tasted great. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"The best Thai Restaurant in town! This place is under new management, the new owners and staff are really nice. I had Tom Yum, Pad Thai and also ordered mango sticky rice and fried banana. I really love all the food!! You guys should give it a try , and don't forget to order the dessert, they're so yummy :)"}
{"text":"Love the food. They go above and beyond to help my wife who is gluten free have a amazing dinner. I would eat here every day if I could afford it. The honey chicken is awesome."}
{"text":"New ownership is fabulous... nice decor & yummy food!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Asian fusion place!   Pad Thai beef is unreal!   Saki bombers are amazing.    Pineapple fried rice is to die for!   We love the combination platter!  The won ton soup is excellent and serves 4 people!   The service is great and we come frequently!    Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my birthday. I saw the reviews and wanted to give it a try. We came around 5:30pm on a Friday and it was well dead so yeah I kinda got worried about the food not being good since my family drove a ways to get here.   We ordered appetizers, chicken skewers, stuff shrimp, coconut shrimp and edamame. I don't eat shrimp so I couldn't tell you how they were but my family said they were good and flavorful however everyone's favorite was the edamame, it was covered in this flavorful garlic sauce.   I ordered the drunken noodle which was good but not spicy, it's weird I've never been to a Thai pace that didn't ask you what spice level but the spice is just cooked with the dishes you ordered. Good thing they have chili oil to add if you want it more heat.  My husband ordered the pineapple fried rice and that was awesome, my son ordered orange chicken sauce on the side and I gotta say that was really good orange chicken not overwhelmingly sweet. Now I think the best dish on the table was this crispy chicken dish that my brother got. It's battered chicken pieces covered in this mayonnaise siracha sauce, tangy spicy and not too over powering.   The best part at the end was this awesome mango sticky rice desert!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a small snack, tasty dinner/lunch, or happy hour. The service and prices are amazing, staff very friendly and the food is always so fresh and tasty. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good Thai or Chinese meal as they have a little something for everyone on their menu ."}
{"text":"We just discovered this lovely hidden secret in the neighborhood and it has become our go-to spot for delicious curry and asian food. The place may appear empty but dont let that fool you. It is under new ownership and battling the bad reputation from the previous restaurant that was here. The food is amazing, service is very polite and personalble. The atmosphere is quiet, peaceful and even somewhat romantic. Everyone I bring in loves it and comes back for more. Highly recommend giving it a try before everyone discovers how great it is."}
{"text":"This place was my absolute favorite when I was younger and I know they recently underwent a change in management so I convinced my boyfriend for a night out here and I wasn't disappointed! Generous portions with delicious pork fried rice and yummy mango and coconut rice Desert I was too excited to get pics before devouring it! My favorite is the Pink Pepper favorite in shrimp yum"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here.  Had green curry and the ginger beef.  Both were amazing.  Huge Thai teas here.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pink Pepper Asian Fusion is under new ownership(Yay!), so we decided to give them a try. Wow are we glad we did!! Their food was very fresh, flavor-able and delicious. The waiter was very friendly and answered all the questions we had. It's nice to have a waiter/waitress know the menu, that's a definite plus. This was the best Thai food we have had in a very long time. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited pink pepper with a group of 4 for lunch. I liked that they have many lunch options and the lunches come with a tasty soup to start and a spring roll on the side. The service was attentive and helpful. I tried several items including a curry, the drunken noodles, and their delicious sweet crispy honey chicken. Everything was tasty, though a bit less spicy than I would have liked. It isn't the best Thai food in town, but it's a solid choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The family were craving Asian food but didn't want to go to a semi fast food type place. We decided to try this place and are so glad we did! At first we were wondering why there weren't many people there but once we were so kindly greeted we forgot. Service started out great and didn't stop. We tried the Edamame and Basil Rolls. The edamame was fantastic and Basil rolls were good. The entrees were all shared and there were many compliments. We had the Lemon Chicken, Szechwan Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  The staff were so friendly and we will definitely be going back to our new Asian restaurant of choice.  We've now been back another time and the food quality, presentation and service were great! We have definitely found our new favorite and we're glad to see so many people there. Also noticed the takeout business was steady."}
{"text":"Joined a friend for lunch,  Friday. Nicely decorated and laid out restaurant, nice ambiance. Very pleasant waiter took drink orders and brought me the best Thai iced tea I've had since Nakhon Sawan province,1973. Friend had the drunken noodles and said they were great. Mine was house special\"crispy fried shrimp in creamy sauce\". Comes with fried rice, crispy tasty egg roll, and preceded by hot and sour soup. Very delicious and satisfying meal.  I highly recommend you give them a try. Obviously new owner, mgt,  have a potentially great place here, we need to keep them prosperous. Can't wait to bring my wife here, she's gonna love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I happened upon this place. It was well decorated but not very busy. It was so good! The crab Rangoons were the best I have had! The Pad Thai wasn't too spicy but you can add spice to your taste. It was delicious. We would definitely recommend this place. Lots of options and all of what we had was great!!"}
