{"text":"First off, I'd like to say this isn't actually a vegetarian / végétarienne restaurant, it's a bistro style restaurant with a variety of elegantly prepared hors d'oevres, salads and meals. As a vegetarian I was extremely impressed with their selection and the elegent way the food was presented. We ordered a cooked beet salad which consisted of cooked beats, onions, other seasonings and warm goat cheese. It's possible the best salad I've ever had. Additionally the outside seating provides a lovely view of the water and boats and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. My only complaint: they had a limited selection of beers available."}
{"text":"We came here twice during our trip to Montreal and both times had a good experience! The first day was just for an afternoon drink and a snack; the skewers with the tomato, date, cheese, and basil are delicious and a nice treat to share. My sangria was a little 'shmeh' and definitely overpriced. We ended up there for lunch yesterday, a combination of escaping the torrential rains and satisfying hungry bellies. The chips and home made salsa as a starter were good, a large portion for $7 but the salsa wasn't super flavorful. My salmon tartar more than made up for it, however, a nice big portion filled with fresh herbs and paired with a rather loaded salad containing strawberries, beets, almonds, and grapes. The boys each had some sort of sandwich with sausage and saurkraut, which looked pretty hefty. It is a bit of a tourist trap but the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Tourist trap.

The location with the outside seating is nice, I will give them that.

However, sangria was meh, beer selection was slim, service was spotty, and the food menu was quite uninspiring."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in Old Montreal. This place is located right by the docks across from a small park where you can just sit and hang out. 

As far as Origine Bistro good place to come for a drink or a small snack. Most of the seating is located outdoors, so it makes for good people watching. 

Service is good and prices are a bit expensive. Still worth coming to especially for the people watching."}
