{"text":"Worst experience ever. The female waiter who is one of the owners of the restaurant does not know what is on her own menu. She rushed us to order our food 3 times within the 5 minutes that we had just sat down. It takes them 30mins to give us a simple small stirfry dish, with only 3 other tables and less then 15 customers during a lunch time. Does not take cards and gives tap water but has no ice at all. The waitress made a mistake on one of our dish but insists that it was better than what we ordered, and did not want to return the dish and give us what we wanted at first. They Advertised them self in the name of a California Chinese restaurant but it's nothing alike. Their KTV is barely soundproof as we can hear people singing clearly while we were trying to eat. The only good thing is the food actually tasted fine, but the bad is far more than the good, I will not come back again."}
{"text":"First of all, this is an authentic Hunanese restaurant. Every dish tastes exactly like what I had before in China. Spicy and flavorful!!!  . Price is decent.  . The service is the same as rest of the Chinese restaurants. Servers don't speak proper English but I didn't have bad experience with them this time we went.  . If you want to try some authentic hunnanese dishes, I highly recommend and this is definitely the best one in Vegas. However, don't expect a five star hotel costumer service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Chilli eggplant is our favorite dish. And also spicy shrimp have great spicy and flavor in it. The restaurant is quite and clean. Definitely come back."}
{"text":"I mean I am from Hunan, and this is the best Hunan cuisine I ever had in Vegas. Very authentic and delicious! Definitely worth an five star review."}
{"text":"??????????20%???? Terrible service I ever seen before. We had a dinner of 10 peoples in KTV room. The waitress who is one of the owner said someone asked for leave so she gonna serve us. She was so rude and asked us to order the food within 5 minutes once when sat down. We ordered 8 dishes and she got mad, she said: that's not enough for 10 peoples, you have to order more than 10 dishes...\", after that, when she came serve us looks like we owe her millions of dollars. When we got the check, I saw the total is incorrect and asked why, she said there will be 10 dollars for the white rice even it won't mention in the menu or check. Just fine we paid it and signed 15% of the tips. Once we leave, the waitress rushed to us and asked for 20% tips!! Just fine, we gave her few more dollars but I hereby to say this: I would never come back and I want to share this experience for all of you who want to eat here."}
{"text":"We went there one month ago! Still can not forget the terrible experience. Food is not tasty. Rice is very hard to swallow. They put our leftover rice back to the rice cooker IN FRONT OF US! No service at all!!!"}
{"text":"If you hate someone, just bring him/her here! Totally a nightmare! Poor service? If you hate youself! Go eat there!"}
{"text":"The one and only real Hunan/Sichuan restaurant in town. i have been waitting for some thing like this ever since moving to this fakeass town. its one of the few chiness restaurant here with no \"American Compromise\" in its cooking. Yet if you'r white and look for good \"service\" or cultural experience, please turn your car around and go straight to Panda Express- its not for you.     I dont care if Jesse Pinkman serves the table, when you got Mr White on the cook.   And hell Yea they got the BLUE STUFF  dont give out one star for not getting good service, you ruinning Yelp for food seekers"}
{"text":"Here is worse service I never seen?very small place I don't know Why the waitress super busy.when we order they said their food really big.Actually it's salty and small.I Can't ate nothing in the snail.I won't go again!!!"}
{"text":"Ok definitely make your way down here for a terrible experience. Waitress is either no where or half asleep playing with her cellphone. Since the Waitress is no where to be seen the order is then made with the chef.  The chef has to bring the dishes and hot teapot out to the guests. Oh wait a minute, after 10mins the waitress then appears and want to take orders which is already placed, now we have the repeat the order with her and surely she has a lot of commentary to what you want. She then walk away like a motionless zombie and yells at the kitchen by repeating the order. Guess what she will do next? Back to her cellphone! This business will fail big time if it is operated under this type of management."}
{"text":"Horrible service, inconsistent promotion information, lack of responses to customers' demands, to name a few about tgis place. If its not for its chilli, i wouldnt go there again. Oh wait, i just found the red chilli in 168 market. I guess i dont need to go back to this place anymore."}
{"text":"Authentic food but terrible service. The server was just simply rude. And they didn't tell us no credit card payment option until we got the check!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 12:00 and the store was empty on a Saturday, immediately I yelped this place and was disappointed to see this place with 2 star current rating.  I ordered 3 dishes thinking they probably won't turn out good, as one of the yelped referred this place as if you hate yourself, go there . Lol!   Anyways, the food turn out above average. I ordered frog with Ginger, pepper with sliced pork and loofa squash with eggs. I liked all 3 dishes! Other than the loofa soup, the meet dishes are both a bit saltier, which is normal for places serve Hunan or Szechuan food cuz they are known for having heavier taste buds.   Gave a 4 star because they could have better server :)"}
{"text":"We came about 12:30,usually very busy lunch time in other restaurants. But on the contrary,here very quiet. We ordered 3 dishes. All taste good . but a little bit expensive,the portions are not too much. In other word,you can get same thing even better in other place for less money.          The waitress wear dress and carry a mini bag  on her shoulder. That's weird. Isn't she working? I asked for some water,she seemed  like impatient. When we wanna a check.,She brought a written recipe,even it's just a copy. She counted by calculator and counted wrong. I pointed out and gave tips. Maybe never come back again. I don't think it's worth me to spend $50 to get bad service and not impressed food."}
