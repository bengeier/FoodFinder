{"text":"Laylow makes great beer and great food. When it comes to beer, they know what's up. They always keep it interesting with new beers on the menu. The food is always great, whether you're there for dinner or brunch (brunch on weekends!) They've been a great addition to the hood - beer, food, tunes, brunch - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Wandered into this comfy beer nook one sunny weekend arvo on a walkabout, as you do, the owner(?) was busy gluing pennies to a ledge. Turns out the entire island bar top was fibreglassed to perfection with ancient pennies! As a big fan of finer interior details, I was not surprised to find their beer selection was just as ambitious and tasty. I did not get to try their food, which was well matched to the bar's unusual style, but it looked delicious. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"This is not the greatest place. There is a very limit menu ( what they have is good ) but the choice of wine is nonexistent, and the beers are heavy and sweet. The atmosphere is rather bleak to be kind. Service was good once , but dismal on the next two visits. Given time it might improve , but don't hold your breath."}
{"text":"I was initially really excited too see what was to become of our beloved me&mine. This place is a bro-y type place with music that's way too loud to carry a conversation- comparable to some of what's become of queen west or the Ossington strip. Also the service was bad. Nobody greeted us or explained anything but instead the staff was in a possy at the back with what seemed like exclusive friends/guests. The beer selection is good but way overpriced. Skip and check out the 47 on bloor or moto on dundas for great beers and food!!"}
{"text":"Small place, so make a reservation if you have a large group. Cozy and well lit. Table, high top and bar seating.

When I was there, flights of beer were not available, but they did offer half pints. Beer was pretty good and I'd like to try more. They change the taps every so often. When we were there, it had just changed and the menu was slightly different. Pricing was very reasonable.

I needed a sweet treat, so I got the Coconut Curry Creme Brulee. I know, weird right? Not really. I didn't taste a lot of coconut, but the curry was there. Not overpowering, just complimentary to the custard. The rest of my friends ordered Doubles and they were so good, no one offered to share a bite with me. :P

Service was awesome. It's a dang cool place."}
{"text":"Went in on a Fri around 8, it wasnt busy a group of 4/5 were leaving maybe 10 ppl were left. We stood awkwardly at the front for a while in case we had to wait to be seated. After a while I made my way to the bar with {Ray Singh} it was cool they had pennies under plexiglass/ apoxy resin thing as the bartop and someone slid the drinks menu under our noses. After we decided we looked up and bc there are no bar stools at the bar we thought the tiny table in front of the bar would be perfect. As we made our way there a staffer put a squirt bottle on it. This halted our advance and we waited awkwardly--- for a while, looking at each other we decided we had no idea what was going on, were we invisible? No, clearly not, since we got menus,but we felt sooo incredibly awkward with how we weren't greeted, or seated and since we cant punch or run orders ourselves we decided to leave after deciding we had waited long enough considering it was at best 1/3 packed/moderately busy.
Oh the best part I tried to tell them on instagram about the experience and instead of welcoming me to come back or promising that that wouldnt happen again they deleted my very neutral comment so here ya go! 

Thats their customer service in a nutshell.
Shout out to Emmet Ray whiskey bar btwn ossington and dufferin on college for offering up a good time where Laylow dropped the ball!"}
{"text":"Laylow is a local for me, which may color my review, but I love these guys.  The deconstructed s'more is delightful.  Every house-brewed beer they've served me has been great, and although there is usually a small selection of house-brewed along with a well-curated Ontario craft tap list, they rotate regularly, so there's always something new to try.  I like higher ABV brews, and they don't disappoint there, either.

For brunch, as a pescatarian, the house-cured and smoked steelhead trout on potato latkes is my favorite eggs benny ever.  

To top it off, there's good hip-hop playing often, there are books to tell you more about it, and the staff are friendly and really helpful.  For me, the art on the walls has stayed fresh through multiple visits, and the seating is nice.  The front windows open in good weather.

I wish they had a patio, and I wish the brunch coffee was served in real cups (it comes from the next door coffee joint) but aside from that, it's perfect."}
{"text":"What an amazing little gem in little Portugal! Adisa, the owner and chef, came to the tables to speak to patrons when he had free moments and talked about the history of his upbringing and inspiration for the menu. I've never had Trinidadian food but the mist-haves are: the ox tail crepe, the goat Wellington, the jerk chicken and Mac & cheese pie, the doubles, and the Colonel. Go with 3-4 people and have a family-style meal. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Cosy and slightly off the beaten path. Amazing beer line up, and fantastic food. Always changing. Always interesting.    Great place for dates, or drinking with a group."}
{"text":"Nice local option. Very friendly staff. Great music. Decent beer list. Food was solid. I'll be back for that Gnocchi."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a light dinner and some beers at this west end College Street spot. Overall, I'm glad to see this place exists as the area is pretty lacking in both bars and good food options aside from pho. 

The interior is quaint, and there are aspects of the styling in the rooms that I like as the lighting in the room and the art on the walls make the place seem casual and easy going. I especially like the walls that are lined with 7\" records in the bathrooms for that matter. Musically, there was a decent mix of classic and a bit of newer hip hop playing, however I will admit it was a surprisingly (and distractingly) loud level, especially loud given how empty the room was at the time. 

On the drinks front, their draught taps are served in 12oz pours which admittedly I'm not a big fan of. I can get down with a 12oz pour for high % ABV's or if it's priced accordingly for its size, but when a glass rings in over $8 after tax that's admittedly a strike against it. But I will give them credit for the fact that in addition to a few international and craft beer options, they actually do offer their own house brewed beer as well. They had a few house brewed options on tap as well as 500ml bottles that go for $10+tax. The beer is decent, and it seems like they plan to have new beers available all the time, so I'll give them a passing grade despite the small glass sizes.

The food I will admit was quite good, probably being the highlight of the experience. Although we only munched on some sandwiches, salads and fries, it was all well prepared and presented. I personally liked the porchetta sandwich the most but the piri piri chicken did have a nice spice to it as well.

Friendly service, good food, decent beer. I'm not as over the top about this place as a lot of other reviewers, but it is indeed A-OK here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I almost hate to write this review because I want to keep The Laylow my own secret. If you're looking for a quiet spot to linger over Sunday brunch you'd be hard pressed to do better than here. I've never put anything into my mouth here that was anything short of amazing. The bread pudding french toast is a sticky sweet treasure. The breakfast poutine is delightful. The corned beef hash is hearty & savory. The eggs Benny on latkes was a hangover killer. The atmosphere is quiet & laid back with old school hip hop & a dash of acid jazz playing in the background and the service is attentive but unobtrusive.
Did I mention that not only do they have a great beer list, they also brew in house. A task at which they also excel. I know I'm gushing, but I legitimately can not recommend The Laylow highly enough."}
{"text":"The food was unbelievable! The beers were fantastic! I loved the atmosphere! Just go."}
{"text":"Tons of potential but it's yet to be realized. 

Their house beer is solid without being great. You'll find better options among their guest taps. Their beer is stupidly overpriced, 12oz pours at a 20oz price. The beer would be just okay at half the price. 

Food is the highlight. The focus on house-made ingredients shines through.

Their machines support tap, but the waitress doesn't."}
{"text":"Great beer, especially the stuff they brew in house! Brunch was amazing too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service here is awesome! Came on Sunday night for a drink and it was just amazing! Great vibes, open mic comedy night, there was about 6-8 comics that performed and who were very funny! They have a variety of beers at the bar, and a unique selection of cocktails. Very good staff, courteous, generous and a wonderful place for a drink and to destress after a long week."}
{"text":"A newly opened brewpub, making their own beers also specializing on other import beers too. 

They had 3 own beers on tap and one guest beer: Rodenbach Grand Cru on tap. Usually they have 5 to 6 homebrews. I liked their golden ale, it was crisp and malty, their witbier needs more aroma and hops, the brown ale lacks the roastiness and sweetness, maybe it's the yeast, I don't know. 

I ordered salsa and chips and some bread with humus which was really good. Considering the price you have a decent sized snack to share. The music was nice, the beer flight of 3 is $9, beers are priced from 7 to $10. There are 4 tables inside, 2 high chairs and a couple bar stools. A bench outside for smokers also exist. WiFi is free and has enough speed. It was quiet for a Saturday night though. I could be a new fan of this place. Looking forward to try their stout."}
{"text":"Everything that was put on our table was delicious. This place is getting noticed for it's beer selection but the food was delicious. Had the calamari, cod croquette, and the mussels. The mussels were awesome. First I find there aren't many places that have them, and the brine was the perfect thickness. Thick enough to scoop up but not gravy thick. The calamari had a delicious batter and deep fried capers. Croquettes were a nice fresh flavour and a great compliment.

I usually don't order desserts but did today. The s'more w
Is a must try. Torched to perfection, even the Graham crumble was toasted.

A place to try for delicious low key eats"}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the neighborhood. These guys brew really good beer and have a fun, bar snack appropriate menu. The warm olives dish is amazing, as is the porchetta poutine. 

As far as the beers they brew, I enjoyed the stout the best. It was viscous and delicious, just how a stout should be. They also have a farmhouse ale that I liked. 

Service is great. I think I've met all three of the dudes that own it and they are unfailingly friendly, accommodating and cool. They're all pretty much hip hop nerds from the same generation as me, so pretty easy to get along with. 

Location is great because this stretch of college street needs some more action. There are lots of people in the neighborhood who don't want to go all the way down to Dundas or up to Bloor, and I think local people have been figuring out that Laylow is a damn good local option. Concept and execution is great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem! I stopped in for a drink with a friend of mine and I ended up staying for a few hours! It's an intimate little place that serves up some great food and a good selection of craft beers. 

I had the doubles, which were incredible- I only wish there were more of them! I tried a few of their home brewed beers and I really enjoyed all of them. 

The staff were super nice and friendly, and were happy to make recommendations.

I will 100% be back! I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Considering making this place my new local. 

Great beer, great food (get the doubles, for the love of all that is good and delicious, get the doubles), run by two buds who go back to high school days, and a welcoming space to boot. What more do you need?"}
