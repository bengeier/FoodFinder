{"text":"Great Chicken Philly, bomb pizzas.  Seriously!  Best Pizza in Cleveland.  Great servers.  Owner even said hi.  Thanks.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Victory Alley is a great to hit before or after anything at The Q or Progressive Field.  I have been there several times and it has been a good experience for several reasons.  The space is awesome, open and airy, even when it is packed it does not feel stuffy.  The food is surprisingly good and fits the definition of a really good bar menu (tuna melt, loaded tots, and pizzas are great based on what I have had there).  I have never had any issues with the service.  It is also in a very convenient spot for stopping in before or after the game or events.  The huge screens have been great for watching games allowing for adequate viewing from just about anywhere in the bar.  For only being open for a short while, this place is on the right track to being a staple for events downtown.  And, it is really great to see a quality establishment occupy a space that has housed businesses that have been a relative abomination to the area around the arena and baseball field for the last ten years.  Thank you to whomever killed those places and opened Victory Alley."}
{"text":"While the menu isn't quite finished, and the place still needs some polish, the service was exceptional and the prices were great. I was having a genuinely good time with my work friends when I was pleasantly surprised to hear Creed's \"Arms Wide Open\" come on. We were all singing along and in that moment I couldn't have asked for a better Saturday night, but that moment was abruptly cut short when one of the owners changed the song. My friend, Brett, paid to hear that song, and with no regard to their paying customers' satisfaction, the owners put on Beyonce. I  will be going to the Clevelander next weekend and I hope management at the Victory Alley takes this week to think long and hard about what they did last night."}
{"text":"I watched the first half of the cavs game here and my party got the hell out as soon as halftime came.  Drafts poured into plastic cups and the place wasn't a quarter full.  And before the game started, some truly wretched music on the loudspeaker.  But the truly, ~truly~, awful part was sitting two seats down from a backwards ballcap-wearing loudmouth in a *staff t-shirt* who appeared to have an ownership stake or at least a management role in the place .... loudly complaining about \"the Jews and Spear Chuckers\" in Cleveland Heights.  There's a surfeit of mediocre-and-above sports bars in Cleveland; no need to patronize this place."}
{"text":"I met a couple friends for Friday happy hour.  I sat at the bar and watched the bartender text and talk to other servers for a couple minutes.  Made eye contact a couple times with the head nod to let them know I was ready.  Still ignored. After 10 minutes I finally just loudly asked if I could have a beer. Having to ask for service each time was necessary for the next couple beers as well.   I noticed it wasn't just me, everyone else at the bar had to ask to be served each time their long empty pint glasses suggested they might want another.  

It seemed the staff were annoyed at the presence of customers, and would rather text/gossip than do their job.  Good beer selection though and great location if you are going to a game."}
{"text":"I was an unassuming gentleman standing outside after Opening Day when I rather pretty woman asked if I'll help carry beer into the establishment. I took heed to her words; I carried about 5 cases in. Not much else to say but the employees sounded nice! Lemme know if you need help carrying beer in again. Go Tribe."}
{"text":"As a huge supporter of The Cavs and Indians and the whole gateway district I was excited to check out the new  sports bar in the  neighborhood. .I walked in and said  Wow....The open space, wall of TV'S and the bar made me feel like I was  in a real sports bar. .The girls behind the bar were cute and did a great job making sure that we had  a drink. .The menu was limited but the food was good. .I saw a lot of people I know in there for  opening day...It will be a great place to watch a Cavs playoff game and also one  of the 5 places that  I plan to visit for the 20 tribe games I go to this year"}
{"text":"This place just opened up right by Wilbert's & Thirsty Parrot. A few friends of mine and I went to check it out on Opening Day before the game got cancelled. It was a blast! The drinks were flowing, food looked delicious and the music was on point. Really diggin' the atmosphere and setup of this place.

Definitely recommend checking it out before an Indians game or a night out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a drink to check it out and it's my new favorite sports bar downtown. They have a bunch of tvs so I'll be back for Browns games. Found out they have NFL package."}
{"text":"Great food, great people and incredible atmosphere. I highly recommend the pizza! The staff is very friendly and always welcome everyone as they walk through the door. This was the place to be during the Cavaliers run throughout the playoffs. 
I recommend anyone coming to an Indians, Cavaliers, Monsters or even Browns game to start here. Oh yea, 12' tvs."}
{"text":"We ordered food on grubhub and it never came...after 2 hours of waiting. We called the restaurant and no one picked up. Even grub hub called them and they didn't pick up. What the hell?"}
{"text":"The service may be the worst I've ever experienced. There were maybe 20 people in the whole bar and the 3 servers all were sitting at a table texting. Literally awful service and such a shame because the place is so nice."}
{"text":"1 hour+ wait for food, horrible service to tables not at the bar. Do not go if you're hungry or thirsty."}
{"text":"New Place In Cleveland. Best Sports Bar In town. Great atmosphere before, during, or after ANY sports event! Located in the heart of it all."}
{"text":"I actually don't want to review this place and give it any publicity b/c   I'd like it to stay not as crowded as the other bars around Gateway. I can see what the negative reviews are talking about but we had a good experience before the Tribe game last night. Couldn't be a better location behind scoreboard at Progressive Field. There were two bartenders running the whole place. So I'm glad we were at the bar. They were hustling and were probably planning on the place clearing out at 7pm but the rain delay had it packed, so it's a management issue, hire a waitress on game days maybe? Anyhow, our food was good. Had hot wings and chicken queso dip. I'd like to go back and try the burgers. Bartenders were very nice and we did not feel a nuisance like past reviewers. It's a cool spot with games, open space, the back door open had a nice breeze coming through the garage style doors in front leading to patio. So hope you all stay away b/c it's my secret pregame spot. Very glad it's not a strip club anymore."}
{"text":"Spent two hours waiting for a server to come to our table. Literally ignored. Can't wait to see what the next owners have in store after this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"Stopped in before going to the Cavs game last night at the recommendation of a man standing outside who said it was his favorite place. The power was out for a while when we walked in but we didn't care a bit. This place has such a great feel about it that I found myself wishing I could have stayed. The bartender made an amazing martini! I will definitely be back as this is my new favorite place in Cleveland now!"}
