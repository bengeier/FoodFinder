{"text":"This wonderful Indian restaurant, located in a basement in Bloor West Village/Swansea, is one of my best finds ever. I discovered it about 6 months ago and have become a regular customer.  The restaurant is very pleasant with a lovely ambience, and the wait staff are friendly and helpful.  The food is to die for.  I've tried the lamb jalfreezi, chicken tikka masala, eggplant bharta, saag paneer, chana masala, butter chicken and a host of other dishes.  Every single one was outstanding, pretty much the best I've ever tasted.  The portions are generous too. Their garlic naan and garlic rice are exceptional too.  Whether you eat in, take out and call delivery (which is free), you can't go wrong. I hope people will continue to support it because it's the only restaurant of its kind in the area and it deserves to thrive!! If I could give it ten stars, I would."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Everything we've ordered has exceeded our expectations.  The service was fantastic as well.  Such a wonderfully delicious experience.   We were missing an Indian restaurant in Bloor West Village!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Other reviewers have left plenty of reviews about how good the food is, and my experience matched it. And the staff were plenty friendly, and the decor and ambience are great -- a little hidden gem in a Bloor West lower level.  But it was SLOW. Perhaps we messed up the regular pace by having two of our party of four show up 15 minutes after the reservation time (although there was no evidence that they'd recorded a reservation -- they didn't recognize my name and just found us an available table), but we went straight to mains without appetizers, and it took easily 75 minutes for our food to come out with no updates from the servers.  Another table which was already seated when we arrived got their food when I would've expected us to get ours, so it wasn't just our table left to wait.  We'll probably go back, it was incredibly good Indian without the lienup of, say, Curry Twist, and maybe they were short-staffed in the kitchen or something. Hopefully next time it won't be a three-hour affair."}
{"text":"Recently visited this place for dinner with a friend and loved their sizzlers, especially lamb chops and prawns were my fav. I do recommend this place and do order those platters."}
{"text":"As a Brit living in Toronto, finding a decent Indian restaurant has been somewhat challenging. I totally accept that British Indian is different but it's more the quality of ingredients I look at rather than the dishes themselves.  Bukhara Grill rivals some of the establishments I loved in the homeland. It is fresh tasting, reasonably priced and consistently delicious. My husband hates spicy food but loves this place. I cannot recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"As an Indian living in Atlanta, where we have some great Indian dining options, we were taken aback with the excellent food and service at Bukhara. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. We had a lamb sheek kabab, chilli chicken, goat dum biryani and some naans. All dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Bloor West Village area, located right below the Pizza Pizza. In fact, it seems a bit sketchy at first going down and there was no one to greet us at the door, but we were seated quickly and offered water and crunchy deliciousness.  The decor looks like a mix of European bar meets a basement wine cellar...it has a rustic, cavernous, and yet romantic sort of feel...a great place for a date if you like quiet and actually being able to hear the person sitting across from you.  We had the prawn pakoras which were succulent with just a hint of spice -- best I've had...I was very happy that they did not overcook the prawns, which I find is the type of thing that restaurants tend to do often.  Chicken jalfrezi and lamb vindaloo with a side of saffron rice and plain naan...incredibly full by the end of our meal, to the point that my innie may have become an outie (and I was hoping for a kulfi for dessert, but there is always next time).  Pretty close to the best Indian I've had in Toronto...the chicken was just a touch dry, but the lamb was incredibly tender. Great service as far as refilling our waters and checking on how we were enjoying the food. Wish we could have eaten more...we'll need to fast next time to make sure everything fits in our bellies ;-)"}
{"text":"My favourite Indian place in Bloor West.  Great takeout run by a great family.  The tandoori platter and bread basket are great."}
{"text":"To the gentleman serving me, please don't get upset cause I didn't get any alcohol. If I'd like to take leftovers, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to pack the food myself. I think it should be taken to the kitchen, and then brought out magically packed!  That's how other restaurants do it! Magic!!   App platter for 2 only had 1 samosa and 2 of everything else. But why??   Smells really good outside. Food wasn't bad. I guess my curry is with the service. OK it doesn't work as well as beef...   Don't you dare only get a mango Lassi to drink!   I'm sorry next time I'll buy two bottles of wine! Please just don't make me pack my food at the table again! :'("}
{"text":"One of the most highly regarded Indian restaurants in the world sits half way across the world in New Delhi, India. It is also called Bukhara and everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Hillary & Chelsea Clinton have enjoyed their giant naan bread, famous kebabs & vegetarian dishes.   But the one we're interested in here is relatively new and resides on Bloor St West in Toronto, Ontario Canada.   If you're a fan of Indian food, Bukhara Grill craft above-average, quality dishes that would compete with some of the much higher priced Indian restaurants in the city. Beautiful balances of flavor and a variety of curries to choose from make it a spicy lover's paradise. Make sure to try the garlic naan bread.   The staff are very welcoming and there is a noticeable attention to detail that goes hand in hand with the service.   Perhaps one day this Bukhara Grill will be able to boast of its celebrity clientele.. while maintaining their down to earth friendliness.   I'm no celebrity.. but I'll be there just in case."}
{"text":"Came in a little after 2. The place was empty. They were still serving their buffet lunch. They have a salad bar which I didn't sample. 10-12 hot food items. Butter chicken, curry goat, stir fried noodles, and a few veggie dishes. Though selection was small, the food was quite good. I tried the butter chicken, curry goat, tandoori chicken and a zucchini dish. All delicious and very filling.  Their naan is freshly made, soft light and chewy but I prefer my naan a little denser and crispier. Their dessert area lacked in selection and cleanliness. Their ice cream scooper was placed on a dish that appeared to have curry sauce splattered on it, and the ice cream bowls had the same splatter. For a small business everything is in the details. For $12.99 I feel it is a great choice for lunch. With minor improvements  I feel this place could be a lot more busier."}
{"text":"Good Butter chicken and Tikka Masala. Very nice indoor restaurant with plenty of seating. Will be going for lunch next time to catch their Buffet deal. :)"}
{"text":"Good food! This was the first time I visited it but I liked all the veg dishes .. They r fresh and nice ! Will go again"}
{"text":"You can't ever go wrong with anything you order ! Delicious food and great service ! I've been to the Bukhara grill few times now and it's been always busy but they always look after you and come check if you're enjoying your meal ! Highly recommend this Resturant !"}
{"text":"20+ order delivery customer. I called tonight to order $28 worth of food to be delivered 0.5 KM away. He says minimum order is $30. He refused to deliver unless I order more. I cancelled my order. Mind you this is at 8:45 on a Monday night which is not exactly a peak time.   I am just pissed off at the pettiness of the jerk on the phone (and they are always semi-incompetent on the phone).  I guess I will spend my usual 2x$50 month orders elsewhere. I am extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Living in the neighbourhood may make me biased, however they are time and time again consistent and fantastic Indian food.  This would have been a 4.5 but this is too constrictive."}
{"text":"I love this place! The dishes are fragrant and tasty. I've eaten there or done take out over 20 times now (in just under 1.5 years) and the food has never disappointed. As a matter of fact, I have friends from London UK who also love this place. Oh the Jalfrezi! It's 9:38 am as I type and my mouth is watering"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for buffet lunch when I'm craving good indian food (and I'm ALWAYS craving indian food). While I do have some criticisms with the place (1. Sometimes servers take too long refilling water/naan 2. On slow days their food just sits there and doesn't seem so fresh) they've never been bad enough for me to stop coming back. I just make sure I time my visits right and its always guaranteed fresh made food... especially the naan which is probably why there's always a wait for them. Definitely my favorite indian buffet in Mississauga."}
{"text":"the best indian food in toronto!!! the best!!!"}
{"text":"If you like spice, you'll love this place! Samosas are great here, very filling! Garlic naan was awesome too. We ordered delivery and it came in 1.5hrs. We got 6 different dishes, all were spicy! The butter chicken couldve been better, unless you like it thin. A little expensive but you get what you pay for. Everything was delicious. We will definitely come back and dine in next time!"}
{"text":"I like Indian food. I seek it out often. To my tastes this place offers excellent Indian food for good value. Loved the garlic Naan!"}
{"text":"Rude Servers and Manager  Bukhara Platter, Chicken Biriyani, Prawn Biriyani :  We went here for dinner on a Friday night and ordered the Bukhara platter and Chicken and Prawn Biriyanis. The platter was good, but the Biriyanis took too long and were not that good compared to other restaurants nearby. We could not get the servers to serve us water or anything for that matter. One of them scared the hell out of a little girl who had asked him something. Waited forever for the cheque to arrive and finally one them rudely asked me to come to where he was standing, he grabbed my credit card and swiped it. I'm never ever going back there again. If you need to eat from this place, pls order takeout. I would definitely not recommend a dine-in."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot in Bloor West Village for Indian food!  I have only heard great things about this place.  I was running some errands in the area and decided to check the place out.   Located downstairs by the Pizza Pizza, the restaurant is a lot bigger and more slightly more formal than expected.  The staff is courteous and friendly and helpful making recommdations.    I went with the butter chicken, which was spicy and creamy with large chunks of chicken. ($12)  The eggplant Bharta was super fresh and flavourful.  I could have eaten then whole dish.  ($10)  The garlic Naan was more buttery than garlic, but pretty good.  ($3)  Overall, I had a really good dining experience here and I will be back for sure.  They have several paneer dishes that I want to try next time.   The place was quiet for a Thursday night, but they had a lot of pickup orders.  There were a few moments where I was the only patron.   I wasn't offered the appetizer crunchy bread basket because I was there on my own.  The other tables got them.  I felt like I missed out (-1 star)."}
{"text":"Food is good. Delivery and Service are terrible. There is a better service/food combo for Indian up on Dundas W at Curry Twist. Id suggest going there if you are in this area."}
{"text":"our fav go-to place for date night, birthdays and when we're too lazy to cook.  food is amazing for both takeout and eat in. such a hidden gem.  not the speediest option but well worth it."}
{"text":"Food is always great here. Love their butter chicken and they have the most fluffy naans. Their portions are huge and one curry is usually enough for two people. Their service is great. Their dining is not busy though. Usually when we eat here, me and my husband are the only one eating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and the service is attentive and friendly. I had the kadai paneer dish and it was delicious. I loved how spicy it was too. I would definitely go back for sure. I see that they have paneer tikka. Maybe I will try that and the channa masala. Maybe vegetable biryani too."}
{"text":"I think Bukhara was pretty good. We ordered:  chicken tikka masala  Plain naan  Saffron rice  Everything tastes good and the naan was fresh! Love.  I found the service a bit dull, the server didn't check in with us often and when we paid the bill and said thank you, he just said ok and left. So awkward."}
{"text":"We live a few blocks from here and this place is amazing!  A bit pricey, but some of the best indian food in Toronto.  They even deliver!"}
{"text":"We ate at Bukhara on the second night they were open and it was a really great experience  The butter chicken and lamb with cashew sauce were very good as were the naan and paratha  Service was friendly and very efficient  A great edition to Bloor West, we'll definitely back"}
{"text":"Did take out from here and found that Bukhara gives good bang for the buck.  Quality is ok.  For quality at similar pricing and less value, I'd go to Curry Twist.  All in all, I'd come back and am happy to have eaten from here.  Pakoras - For $3.99, they provided a healthy portion of pakoras.  With the dips, they were good.  Butter chicken - Average.  Nice portion of sauce & chicken provided.  My wife's the butter chicken fan.  Next time, I'd try a lamb dish of some kind."}
{"text":"The definition of a hidden gem, Bukhara Grill is located in the Bloor West Village, its entrance tucked beside a Pizza Pizza. I was initially skeptical as I walked down a rather steep flight of stairs to get into the restaurant itself, but pleasantly surprised to find that it was elegantly decorated, white table clothes and all, and very quiet despite the hustle and bustle of the main street above. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place on a Friday night after hearing glowing reviews from one of his co-workers.   Ambiance: Beautifully decorated, with white table clothes and white napkins neatly folded on the the table. Very classy, and more formal than I had expected (and found myself dressed a little too casually for the occasion).  Service: One thing that made the experience outstanding was the attentive service. It was a first for me to have a fresh hot towel provided at the beginning of the meal, and never have I ever had my glass of water refilled so many times! The waiters and servers are all very polite and gave helpful recommendations for what to order.   Food: All of the food was fresh, flavourful and delicious! My boyfriend and I shared a basket of naan, garlic rice, Chicken Jalfrezi (chicken cooked with ginger, garlic, onion and capsicum *the orange dish*) and Saag Chicken (chicken cooked with garlic, onion, green chillies and spinach *the green dish*). I particularly enjoyed the chicken jalfezi, as it seemed spicier than the saag chicken. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Fairly typical east Indian restaurant buffet. I've been to this restaurant several times, and the selection is always the same.  Pros: -Decent selection of dishes -Fresh Naan made specifically for the table  Cons: -Naan takes a while to be made, and initial portion was small -Dishes do not change."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp pakora, tandoori chicken, lamb sheek kebab and malabar halibut for dinner takeout. Everything was amazing!! The shrimp pakora were big huge shrimps lightly battered. Tandoori chicken was extremely moist. The fish was ahhhmazing! Each main came with choice of rice or naan. The food was extremely fresh and so well cooked. And everthing totalled under $60. Perfect for  family of 4. Will definitely be going back.  They also have an awesome lunch buffet!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price!  We tried the buffet and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday night after reading many good reviews.I didn't love the stair case leading to the restaurant, but once we got inside all was forgotten. The restaurant is spacious and done in dark wood.  The food was very tasty, though not at all spicy. The hot sauce they bring is great though.  Everything we ordered was on the specialty section of the menu We had: The chicken tikka masala Butter chicken lamb - incredible sauce! All were delicious. The service was excellent every time I've been here. I ordered in once and found the portions to be huge :) I highly recommend Bukhara."}
{"text":"Happy that there is great decent Indian food in the neighborhood.  Very nice service and delicious food.  Restaurant is a bit tucked away as it is in the lower level of the building but it's super cozy and beautiful inside.  Wish they had some pictures advertised so people walking by can see.  We went in only because we have been craving indian food for awhile.  Glad we ventured down the steps.  We've also had delivery several times from here - since we live down the street, food arrives within 30 mins (they quote 60 mins).  Naan and butter chicken are our favorites.  Edit: food is still good but what's up with the service? Servers never look me in the eye, always speaks solely to my male partner. Not a fan."}
{"text":"The food was honestly not bad but the poor service overshadowed everything else. The bald waiter was beyond rude and told us that he needed to go home  even though they sat us and don't tell us that they are about to close."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times for lunch buffet... Love the fresh naan just made, a little greasy though (I think they spray oil on top to look shinny). Buffet selection is not much choice... maybe around 12 to 14 hot dishes. Good enough for me as long as it serves my favourite dishes - the butter chicken and the fried fish but I find it salty for my taste this time. I had a lot of water intake after.  I wish they do have better table service other than just filling water.... Like offer extra naan instead of waiting for us to ask for it. Lunch time wasn't that busy (maybe 4 other client), only 1 server in the restaurant.  Will go again in a month or so when I am craving for East Indian food.... Hopefully food won't be as salty and better table service."}
{"text":"Coming from scarborough/ markham, my fiance and I were scared to not have good indian food in our area. Fortunately we found bhukara through a random yelp search when we first moved into our house. Located right on bloor is this underground (literally) indian restaurant. It is difficult to find at first glance since it's only a single walkway down to the basement but once you are in you can't really get lost.  We've dined in twice and ordered take out many times. The last time we dined in we got the panner tikka tandorri and also got the green chicken (tandorri). Both came out hot and delicious. Portion size were fair as the chicken we got about  5 big chicken breast and panner we had 5 big slices. The flavours were bang on and was so delicious when hot. The only down fall to this dish is I wished they served it on a sizzling plate instead of a regular plate.  For mains we usually get their butter chicken (spicy) and palak panner. Both are very good dishes and we never are disappointed with them! We've also had their aloo golbi and that is also really good and have a good spice to it as well.  Garlic nan and butter nan comes to your table piping hot and leave you wanting more and more once it's done! Pricing for this is also fair (1.99/2.99)   Overall Buhkra grill is our go to indian resto in our neighbourhood. Just wished they delivered to us!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a restaurant where I have stuffed myself so full that I feel sick.   Came here with a large group of work people and they had given us the upstairs area for us. It was a bit cramped for 25 people and we had a hard time fitting in, but they tried to accomodate us as best they could.   My co workers, who are Indian, love this place because they say the food is authentic and best they've ever tasted.   In the buffet line up, (about $10 pp for lunch), you have Butter Chicken, Chicken Masala, a chickpea masala, goat curry, eggplant, byrani rice, cold salads, lots of choose from.  The food was excellent, and they came out with tons of hot  fresh naan (you can tell it's fresh by it's soft texture, and flaky consistency) in baskets, and I was told this is  not common at Indian Buffets as they would normally give you premade ones.   They even threw in a friend's take home box with out charge with all of us there.   If you're in the area, and looking for Indian , this is a place to try out for sure!"}
{"text":"Aces Indian food.  Good service.  This will be a regular stop in my neighbourhood for dinner.  Really top notch and I'm going to try take-out as well."}
{"text":"Good assortment, nice decor, lots of curry and spice...yeah, it was good. Also cheap - $9.99/person. That's less than an entree these days!  I went here based on Stephanie S' recommendation and will give props to her.  I used to go to this plaza all the time to go to Congee Dynasty (which I no longer go to) and never noticed this place.    From the outside, it doesn't look like much because of the ugly red brick building, but on the inside, it looks very fancy with the hanging chandeliers and stuff.    As for the food and service:  Food: 3.5/5 - this would have gotten a 4.5/5 just three days ago, but Avani spoiled me.   What is good about this place is the assortment as they have your typical butter chicken, tandoori chicken, paneer, aloo, chicken tikka masala and goat vindaloo.  You don't see goat at Indian buffets too much anymore because it's pricey, but it is so tasty!!  Avani has limited selection but slightly better quality. NAAN IS EXCELLENT!! THEY'LL BRING IT TO YOUR TABLE. THE NAAN HERE IS BETTER THAN AVANI. Okay, I'll stop yelling.   Also, they actually had fresh fruits for dessert (amongst other normal Indian buffet sweets)  Decor - 3.5/5 - very nice and clean  Service - 4/5 - water was constantly filled, they constantly removed dishes when finished and were friendly.    Very decent food for great price - thanks Stephanie S."}
{"text":"Better than I expected.   Food is great, totally delicious.   Service is friendly.   Decor is pleasant.   Not such a fan of being in the basement but it doesn't really feel like a basement.   We've been back a few times and have enjoyed each visit.   We also tried take out - it took some effort to find the correct number to call but we did. And it took a bit of time to deliver but the food was delicious.   Add this place to your list of places to try.    The food is better than expected."}
{"text":"Food is average. Dal makhani was excellent. Desserts were over sweet. Service is very slow"}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet to this place because I was in the mood for tandoori chicken and curries. The restaurant has a limited number of options. They have a good selection of non-vegetarian curries and vegetarian items. They give you fresh naans at your table, which are soft and good. However, their appetizer section is almost non-existent. They have pakoras, tandoori chicken (which is very good) and a couple hakka Chinese items which are alright, but no chaat or pani puri or bhel or anything. Their dessert section is like an after-thought with ice-cream and half-empty containers of indian sweets. The service is slow, with refills not occuring fast enough. The food is not very hot which is a little sad, considering that it tastes very good. The restaurant overall is humbling, but given the price ($11) as compared to other buffets in this area, you get to enjoy the items, which truly are deliciously prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent. Wonderful addition to Bloor West. Lamb dishes were scrumptious and channa masala with fresh ginger was the best. Dishes on the mild side so ask for spicier if you want it. Staff so friendly and even gave us a naan making demo ... Great night out and we will definitely return. They also do take away, but eating in the elegant space is worth it."}
{"text":"Tried the veg biryani and aloo gobi and enjoyed it.  My wife especially loves the place.    Eaten here twice and foresee many more times.  Heavy set man working was not too friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is slow. Like way too slow. Their veg platter says veg seekh kabab, which their chef doesn't know even exist. The platter just has three mushrooms, and I didn't find even one. One of their server asked me what's wrong and never back to my table. We had to keep asking for water to be served and it was served after 5 times or more regular reminders. Then we had this amazing waitress Mena who followed up with everything and made my visit worth the money over all I would give like 4/5 to food but 1/5 to service.  Will I go again, yes because of the food but would make sure I take something like monopoly deal to pass time while waiting for food coz it takes a lot of time."}
{"text":"employees are always nice and helpful--it's a family affair it seems.  the food is good, consistently.  amazing: samosas, pakoras, saag paneer, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken.  the biryani however is a disgrace.  frozen veggies, no raisins and maybe one or two if any nuts.  they deliver, which is somewhat rare for indian food.  i'd give it 4 stars, but strangely, something about bukhara ALWAYS leaves me with some type of GI situation.  i don't know how to explain it.  i love indian cuisine, have eaten it for decades, and sure, i've had similar experiences from time to time with other indian restos, but every. single. time. i eat bukhara's delicious food, it's hard on my body. ???"}
{"text":"After reading so good reviews about this place, I decided to give it a shot! And Voila!! This restaurant is really good at doing their job. They are in the basement but don't hesitate to go down there. Ambience  Service  Taste  Cleanliness  We reached there around 9:25pm to their closing time (10pm) so they requested us to order everything we need at once as they close their kitchen by 9:30pm and even pay the check before we even finished dinner. But If for a minute we forget about that rush, rest everything was worth it. The offer us wet warm napkins in the start to clean our hands, then serve complimentary papad with two kinds of chutney (mint-was a little towards sweet which wasn't what we expected and tamarind was okay nothing great) but can't complain as it wasn't something we paid for anyway. The tandoori platter was 14.99$, Yeah! It's pricey but the quantity and quality of veggies tandoor were good. Also Paneer kadai which we asked to make it spicy  was super delicious. Garlic naan was also  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to taste real Indian food."}
{"text":"The food here is just amazing. So flavourful and satisfying. The servers here are attentive and kind, and the hot towels at the start of each meal is a great touch. All in all, it's a place I keep going back to for dinner and recommending to all my friends!"}
{"text":"BK is the perfect little hole in the wall. I have followed the owners cooking Mr sharma for a long time now first when he worked at the Host in Mississauga and have been coming here since they first opened. Recent personnel changes haven't gone down that well and the place has all the ambiance of big giant peach walk in closet.   Yet it's all about the food and it's still great. Stick to the tandoori platter and this is enough for at least 3 people. This place is also recommended for solo diners as their main business is takeout and catering. However sometimes I do find the food too salty."}
{"text":"Our go-to neighbourhood takeout and delivery spot. Never had a bad dish here and portions are great value for money. Favourites include goat masaladar and eggplant bharta. Spicy here means spicy. No kidding. But flavours are always on point. I have them on speed dial!"}
{"text":"Put in an order for delivery yesterday. Man on the phone was rude and disrespectful while taking our order. Then it took 2 hours to deliver the food to us. After eating the food, my husband wasn't feeling well (we both decided on different dishes).Now my husband has been violently vomiting all day and unable to keep any food or liquid down. So in a nutshell, he got food poisoning. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the reviews I had read prior to my visit. Delicious food, the sweetest service and a great ambience!   My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken mirch tikka to start, followed by chicken tikka masala and palak paneer, garlic naan and rice. Our server suggested our dishes and was very helpful and attentive.   The portions were extremely fair and I recommend the chicken mirch tikka, absolutely divine.   Thankfully this place hasn't been hit by the mainstream Indian cooking style, so it actually tastes like a home cooked meal with portion sizes that are worth it.   All in all, I can't wait to go back... Especially for the fresh naan"}
{"text":"Among our top 3 Indian places. Meat (chicken, lamb) is tender and dishes are flavourful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This wonderful new restaurant is a true neighborhood gem. Finally, Bloor West Village has a great traditional Indian restaurant of its own. Don't be put off by the unassuming entrance or nervous about going downstairs--the food, ambience and service down there will delight you. It's family run and you can taste the care they put into their great variety of dishes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet. Not a heck of a lot of options though, but good nonetheless.  I like that they don't have naan in the buffet but bring it to your table fresh too. I usually like the peas&cheese (forgot what it's called) and they had the cheese in a sauce (big chunks are good) and it may have been spinach with it but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Bad location. You'll walk past it at least twice. It's a basement. Not a terrible one, but it's far too large for the number of customers able to find the place at any one time. Plus it gives the waiters too many places to disappear to.  There's a young waiter who is a helpful, pleasant sort. The others are middle aged and resentful of that fact. Visit if you're interested in observing just how effectively one can be grudgingly obsequious.  The desserts are terrible. The appetizers are overpriced. The food from the tandoor is dry and flavourless. And it still gets four stars because the curry gravies are delicious. And because Yelp doesn't allow 3.5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Ordered quite a lot of food on Easter Sunday and was a huge hit with the entire family. I used their online ordering service for pick up and the food was ready on time and hot.   Eggplant Bharta - tons of flavor Daal Curry- Creamy and nicely seasoned! Chana Masala- Big serving with lots of flavour and the chickpeas had a nice texture.  Paneer Pasanda- I wish the paneer was in smaller pieces because we had a large group. Would have been easier to share. Butter Chicken - Could have been a bit more meat in the container but sauce was delicious Mughlai korma - huge hit with the meat eaters! Vegetable Biryani- Tons of veggies! Loved this dish Onion Bhaji & Vegetable Pakora - Wasn't much difference in taste or appearance  Tandoori Vegetable Platter- Great little side for vegetarians"}
{"text":"Currently here at Bukhari just finishing dinner. I can say this is so far the best Indian Restaurant I've been to in Mississauga. Nice ambiance, friendly wait staff. Totally recommend their buttered chicken and chicken jalfrezi. Loved the shrimp pakora!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Totally love this place. The chicken korma is smooth and gorgeous. We have ordered many items and loved then all. Great ambiance. More upscale than your typical Indian place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this place this past weekend for the 100th time and once again, I wasn't disappointed. I usually order selections from the Tandoor menu. For the most part the food has been very consistent and haven't had anything bad to really say about the place.  Service is always great, the servers are very attentive  and polite.  What I recommend to order: -Mirch Tikka (HOT!) -Chicken Tikka Masala -Fish Tikka -Onion Bajia"}
{"text":"Food was impressively delicious; loved the Baingan (Eggplant) Bharta and the Goat Curry most. Tikka Masala was very tasty too.  Not too crazy about the vegetable korma, which appeared mostly to be a stew made with frozen vegetables.  Dessert was also quite decent...I would recommend the Kulfi.  The only issue I had with the place was the staff - we ordered too much food, but as we were actually out celebrating a special event (and the night wasn't over), we did not want to pack the food with us. The waitress stood there and asked three times if we're sure we didn't want to take the food with us - she seemed almost offended we did not finish the food, given how she was frowning down at our table."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Great service and exceptional food. Sometimes I order take out from this place for lunchtime but I prefer to dine in because it feels like I am about to indulge in a different world. One has to walk down a bare white stairway from the street to enter the spacious wood clad restaurant...it really takes you by surprise.   Split the appetizer platter, butter chicken, malai prawns, and delicious mixed veggies with Indian spices. Naan it up to soak up the sauces and finish your meal with masala chai.   One star less because the tikki masala I've received for take-out can sometimes be dry."}
{"text":"My go to place for authentic indian food. All the curries are distinct and delicious. You won't regret ordering anything. In addition, must try their daal makhani and biryani."}
{"text":"Not quite sure as to why this place is called Bukhara. Bukhara a city from greater Iran (Uzbekistan) and India is way in South Asia. Not to mention the name itself is confusing when I went thinking I'd have Persian food then I see it's an Indian restaurant. Misguiding people isn't the best way to handle business. Might want to learn to market and rebrand a bit better. This is yet another Indian restaurant misguiding their customers."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING, the naan are perfect and every dish we had was so flavourful and silky. It takes a little while to receive your food, but is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"What sets the Bloor location apart from their Mississauga location is the SERVICE!  Man who seated and served us was very kind and gentle.  Since this restaurant is newer, it's also a more dim, white table cloth, cavernous atmosphere with a lot of wood beams.  Food is more or less the same as the Burnhamthorpe location.  Except Bloor does not have a lunch buffet.  :(  I frequent the Burnhamthorpe location and 1 particular waiter there isn't the most friendliest - at least not to me.  I don't know why.  So when he serves me, I don't feel as welcomed as the other staff.  Another difference is that the Bloor location is slightly more expensive.  With certain dishes rice/naan is not included, so you end up paying a few dollars more.  However, sometimes it is worth it to enjoy your dining experience and be treated nicely, as opposed to complete indifference!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, I am happy to report that Bukhara Grill hasn't failed me!  In fact, it was better this time than the last time I was there which was a few months ago.  (Even though I have been here before, I do get a bit weary when I haven't been somewhere in a while.  I almost expect things to go downhill.  And last time, although the flavours were good, my dishes were quite heavy on the salt.  Very common when dining Indian.)  Meal started off with pappadums with 2 sauces (1 tamarind, 1 coriander chutney - spicy) and we ordered a Mulligatawny Soup, Chicken Mirch Tikka (came with naan), Kadai Paneer (came with rice).    After ordering, the waiter came back to our table and said that the soup wasn't available.  However, the chief (/owner?) returned shortly, apologised, and said that he DID have the soup.  I only tasted it, but it was a nice, rich, lentil soup with coconut milk.    What was impressive was the chief doing the rounds, greeting people as they entered, even seating patrons, and giving them menus.  I like this 'cause it showed that he was humble, didn't think he was \"too good\" to do tasks a waiter would do!  Chicken Mirch Tikka were 6 large kebab chunks of marinated goodness...straight out of the tandoor oven!  The base was a coriander and yes, it was spicy.  :)  The chicken was not only nicely presented, it was moist and not dried out.  Kadai Paneer - was a sweeter dish, good flavours, and came with lotsa chunks of paneer, not 2-3 pieces swimming in gravy like a lot of places.  A coupla groups of people did come in, asked if there was a dinner buffet, and left after they heard it was only a la carte for dinner.  (They do a nice lunch buffet for like ~$10!)  I thought this was a shame 'cause I'd rather eat a nice a la carte, than pay more $$$ to stuff myself silly with mediocre food!  If you're craving Indian in Mississauga, don't want anything too heavy or greasy, and enjoy fine dining without paying the price, Bukhara Grill is definitely a safe bet!"}
{"text":"Excellent looking restaurant with a cozy dim ambiance. The buffet options were limited and standard; Creamy, appealing and adequate supplied with standard fresh naan. The keema parantha with yogurt ( a la carte) was a fried crispy bread stuffed with non-existent meat accompanied with  salty yogourt.. Service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent classy service. It is unthinkable that it is \"only\" a buffet and not some fine dining restaurant. Their food are tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"went because of the great reviews.   1. not a great atmosphere. it's a weird dark basement 2. best naan i've ever had 3. paneer makhani tasted like a can of campbell's tomato soup 4. very meh service.   would probably only go back if i was in the area and desperate for indian food."}
{"text":"Choose to go to Bukhara Grill on Bloor Street West with an infant. I know! What were we thinking, right? The LEAST BABY FRIENDLY place we have ever been. It is on the lower level, so if you have a stroller and a car seat combo - get ready for a workout. NO CHANGING TABLE in the bathrooms. To make it worse NO OTHER PLACE TO CHANGE YOUR BABY, when needed. The service was poor with the server a little short of sounding disinterested in serving us even though it was NOT BUSY AT ALL ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. We found the SERVICE PIECE MISSING. The food was okay, nothing exceptional as with other Bukhara's we have eaten at in other countries.  Agree with another reviewer saying you can get better value at Curry Twist in Dundas than here at Bukhara on Bloor.  I will NOT BE GOING BACK anytime soon. WHAT A WASTE of an evening."}
{"text":"First time came in for lunch buffet, and it was delicious. With tip and everything came to like 13 dollars. Worth it. Naan bread was served fresh and the tikka masala was very good"}
{"text":"Bukhara Grill is a quite, unassuming place with some very good food. I recommend the Bukhara Tandoori Pllatter so you can taste the variety of meat dishes. Their Palak Paneer is also good which lots of nice chunks of paneer (unlike many other indian restaurants). But far and away, their best item is the Kashmiri naan. It is outstandingly good. With the dried fruit and nuts inside, it is extremely addicting. I'd go back just for this one item.  I've ordered takeout and aside from some small confusion ordering on the phone, the service is ok. I've usually had to wait another 5-10 minutes after arriving, but the food is piping hot."}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat buffet is hype af. if you like spicy food, that is great! fresh naans were a gem. the waitress and the chef was really friendly here.  HOWEVER!  I don't know if this was a one and only time thing or if it's just how I handle the types of food, but the food here did not sit well with me, even though I have spicy food on a once a week basis. I'm gonna spare you with the details, but let's say satisfaction of the food was temporary by under an hour."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem on Bloor West. It's hard to spot as it's in a basement, but totally worth going. Also just because it's in a basement doesn't mean it's nasty. The decor is amazing and most importantly the food and service are amazing."}
{"text":"First time I visit this restaurant on Saturday lunch buffet.  The food seem simple not to much like other buffet around city but don't thinking wrong , the taste of food is really good and the price affordable.  Maybe is better if they open buffet for dinner too."}
