{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and decided to try the pad thai dish as take-out.  Portions were small and priced expensive for pad thai @$15.75.  Not authentic like the usual pad thai with tangy peanut sauce. Theirs were oddly made from oyster soya. Throw some oyster soya over vermicelli noodles, add egg, chicken, shrimp and chop suey and call it pad thai. Very disappointed and we won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"We were here visiting from NYC and staying across the highway at the Chateau Vaudreuil (and sort of burnt out on the same menu day after day) - decided we were in need of Thai.   So in a nutshell, this place is more Cambodian than Thai. Their \"interpretation\" of Pad Thai was pretty good, but it totally missed on the very slightly tanginess that I'm used to. They also said it was \"spicy\" - I've never had a Pad Thai in my life that was spicy, and this one was no exception. It simply had no heat, which is fine because I would feel that it was odd for a Pad Thai to be spicy..but why say it's spicy when it's not? I ordered a chicken curry dish - I asked the waitress if the curry was a coconut base - she said yes, but it was more of a dry curry lacking coconut. It was tasty and had the right heat, but it most definitely wasn't Thai. The staff doesn't know the menu well or they just aren't communicating well.  We ordered a noodle dish for the kids - it was, again, not Thai but Cambodian or slightly Vietnamese. One of the children ate most of my rice - I asked for \"just a little bit more rice\" and they brought me a full portion of rice and then charged me $2.95 for it. (A hair steep for mere white rice especially when I only wanted a tiny bit more for one of the boys).  For dessert, we ordered a few of their pineapple beignets with ice cream ($5.90 for two I think). They used canned pineapple and they paired it up with the strangest ice cream - tasted like some sort of praline flavor and it totally clashed (in a bad way with the pineapple). Sorry, but in an Asian restaurant, it's a major faux pas to use canned pineapple. I'm not sure what they were thinking.   Service was fast and attentive. Our food came out quite fast but this was most likely because we came late at night and they were probably trying to get out fast (we were the last table left when we exited the restaurant).  I felt that this place was expensive for what we got. My chicken curry dish was over $15. We wound up spending about $63 including a 20% tip. There is no children's menu, which is unfortunate, but I guess they are sort of unusual in Asian restaurants. We didn't order any drinks or appetizers either. The menu warns you to bring your own wine as they don't serve any alcohol.  In all, if you're craving authentic Thai, go somewhere else as this place misses on that aspect. If you're not in a picky mood, this will do in a nutshell."}
{"text":"Portions did not match the price. Ordered 6 dishes and was disappointed. Flavour was mediocre and absolutely not authentic Thai. Would not go back again."}
