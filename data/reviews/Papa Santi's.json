{"text":"I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.  Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box.  The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.    Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.  It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM?   We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  Good meat and tangy sauce.  Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.  I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Contrary to the other review, there is no wood burning oven. Pizza is ok.  My kids liked it more than I did.  The crust was kind of bland and under cooked."}
{"text":"My partner and I were in Cleveland visiting friends Halloween weekend and we needed a quick lunch after our flight.  Our friends knew this pizza place had just opened, so we decided to check it out.  The shop is a no frills, delivery-and-carry-out-service-only store in a strip mall, which was fine for our purposes.    We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  The crust was new to me.  It had the buttery taste and texture of pan crust, but a flat cracker edge like thin crust.  I generally prefer just one or the other, so it threw me off a little, but it was good.  The sauce was pretty tasty.  While we were waiting, the owner told us an Italian grandmother from Cleveland's Little Italy comes out to make it.  It had that great marinara tomato flavor, but with a meatiness to it and not too sweet.  The sausage and pepperoni were well-spiced with a bit of fennel in the sausage.  They were a little on the greasy side, though.  I was surprised how inexpensive this was - about $10 for a medium.  It will probably be good for people who don't want to spend a fortune on the high-end, suburban fare all around that area."}
{"text":"It's cheap, and that's about all this place has going for it.  I ordered a sausage pizza with mushrooms and peppers, which they were out of.  The pizza was not great even for cheap pizza missing a third of its toppings, and it was greasy to boot.    Can we Pepper Pike/Chagrin Falls/Solon folk please get a freakin' pizza place near us that's good AND delivers, or is that too much to ask?!"}
