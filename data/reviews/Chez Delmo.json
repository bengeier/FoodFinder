{"text":"Chez Delmo se vante d'offrir un service gastronomique au quartier du Vieux Montréal, mais la qualité de sa cuisine est loin d'être à la hauteur de ses prix. Ceux-ci pourraient être trois fois moins chers et j'hésiterais toujours à manger là.  Je suis allé un jour pour le déjeuner, ayant été séduit par son air plutôt chic et sa carte sophistiquée. Le menu du midi s'agissait d'une soupe de crème de tomates et d'un sandwich au homard accompagné de frites (le repas \"classique\"), le tout pour $ 19. Dispendieux, certes, mais je m'attendais a un véritable festin de fruits de mer dans un cadre classieux.   Rien de tel. La soupe était une soupe de boîte Campbells réchauffée qui avait un goût fade et industriel, faite très clairement avec du lait plutôt que de la crème.  Mais il faillait attendre le pire : plutôt qu'un beau sandwich du genre qu'on trouve facilement dans le quartier, on m'a servi, sur deux tranches de pain de mie du supermarché, des bouts de homard surgelés avec de la mayonnaise, cela accompagné d'un petit bol de frites.  Qui plus est, le service était désagréable. J'avais l'impression que les serveurs me guettaient à chaque instant pour savoir si je venais de finir un plat. Aussitôt que j'en finissais un, on me le retirait. Ça donnait l'impression qu'on voulait que je mange et que je parte aussi vite que possible.  Pour résumer, donc, mangez ailleurs. La clientèle habituelle est composée d'hommes d'affaires qui ont plus de fric que de bon goût, ce qui aurait dû m'avertir au départ. C'est peut-être un endroit pour être vu, mais pas pour se faire plaisir."}
{"text":"Gave 3 stars not because of food or service , which were great for which I would give 4 stars. The reason for the 3 stars is because the owner of the restaurant was obligated by two different customers to let us know that our two young kids were too noisy for them and had themselves relocated to a different table. This brought my wife literally to tears after we left since the owner said it's not usually kid-friendly even though other kids are there and were noisier than ours (my wife thinks it may be due to racism, which I disagree with since this is Canada and 21st century). It did certainly make us feel uncomfortable and rushed to finish our $500 dinner so we can leave. ....Besides that, my grilled lobster was delicious, my wife enjoyed her seafood linguini, kids enjoyed their fish and chips and our parents were fond of the grilled salmon and fish soup."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. Attentive wait staff. We enjoyed the oysters and scallop ceviche  for starters. The waiter brought us a complementary third starter to share that was just as yummy. Our son loved the frog legs, the first time he has tried them. I have never seen such a large dish of mussels and they were delicious! Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 and were guided through the menu by our waiter who was not always the most attentive. They apparently had ran out of clean cutlery when I asked for another fork!   Food quality was great very fresh. Some of the info on portions was way off and my husband had to order another entree... but in all the food was good. Nothing exceptional, simply put standard fare for the price."}
{"text":"If you like fine dining, this is a must visit. While Old Montreal isn't necessarily on everyone's list of go-to places in winter, Chez Delmo offers a great dining experience where you can enjoy the food as well as the conversation of your company.  My wife and I enjoyed the Dover sole and sea bass - both were fantastic, as was the rest of our meal. Our server (Stephanie) was perfectly charming and professional at the same time.   We'll be back again on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"We had a great at this resto which was recommended by the concierge in our hotel. The staff was great and very accommodating . One of our best meals in Montreal"}
{"text":"Chez Delmo is an institution and one of the oldest name in Montreal. The restaurant has a very pleasant dining room and a great busy bar for happy hour. At night this is a suitable place for couples, business tables and groups. It is not noisy, it's very confortable and you feel right at home when the owner welcomes you. The staff is professional, attentive and friendly, you won't need to ask for a glass of water to be refilled. The food is always exceptional and fresh. The Dover sole from Holland is a classic and a must try! I also love the seafood Poutine, a new item on the menu. I recommend this place for anyone who enjoys great food in a charming location."}
{"text":"I've been impressed with Montreal cuisine and Chez Delmo hits a high note in classic french seafood.  The restaurant is close to the Notre Dame Basillica but still in a quiet location. The ambiance is refined and classic but comfortable. Jackets would not be out of the ordinary but clearly not required.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.  I chose the halibut, my wife had the mussels with oysters, and our oldest child had the filet migon.  The halibut was buttery smooth with a delicately crispy crust - wonderful.  My wife said the oysters were the best she has had - all locally sourced.  The steak was great.  I was impressed that they used a more fatty cut of filet.  A must do for Montreal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Food was decent but not overly impressed for the price."}
{"text":"Our meal was delish. Service was very attentive. The Walleye and the Arctic Char were exquisit. Cooked to perfection . I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Still the Best fish/seafood restaurant in the city because it is consistently delicious. Walleye was cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce that I would like to have the recipe for. Lobster rolls were the tastiest I've had outside of Maine, USA. The fries could have been a cooked a tad more but tasty nonetheless. We were recommended a red wine that was spot on with our meal. You can't leave without the chocolate fondant and the millefeuille.  Thank you Delmo for another wonderful evening."}
{"text":"came here for my bday.  we were greeted at the door and our jackets and hats were quickly taken for us. our server spoke great english and the wait team was very nice. we have a new version of the old classic French75 which was very good. we shared two starters and both had fish. both prepared with love. the halibut was like a pillow, moist and tender.  we shared two desserts and both were fantastic. what a great find would love to come back with friends or just to sit at the bar for drinks."}
{"text":"This is that great local place you are looking for in Old Montréal. Father and son team treat all guests like extension of family. There is great pride and care in delivering fresh fish with simple, classic preparations. We enjoyed the Dover Sole and Walleye as recommended. Cocktails and desserts were delicious and well-grounded with local flavors. Strike up a conversation and it will be the perfect complement to a great meal."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with an amazing staff, food and service. They make you feel like family and even let me on my birthday ..stay after hours with a glass of red wine, watch American baseball World Series late and in return I had a great conversation around the bar about this American girl from Texas loving the Houston Astros and having a fun time. Thanks Chez Delmo for making a memorable evening and hospitality when I'm in town again soon."}
{"text":"French seafood fine dining to go to! Be prepared to pay deep out of pocket but worth it for the price.   Started out with the grilled octopus appetizer which was small but grilled to perfection and paired perfectly with the bruschetta.   The BF had the Arctic char meunière (flat fish between a salmon and a trout) entree with rice and vegetables and I had the Chilean sea bass (a hearty meaty white fish) which I have had before with rice and mashed potatoes.   While we were waiting for our entree to come out, they brought out a salmon croquette to cleanse our palates which was super tasty.   Will definitely save money to splurge on my next dinner here when I come back"}
{"text":"So great. The proprietor-Benoit is the best. We were very interested in the art/ murals on the walls right when we sat.  Benoit ended up telling us all about the artist Carlito the Montreal native living in Brazil. A new personal favorite - must see the interior and hear it's relation to the old mural that was up behind the old bar. The history of the restaurant, there since 1860 I believe, fills you with nostalgia. The Oysters Mornay & Bisque were perfection. We can't say enough about how lucky we got to start our trip off finding this Gem.  We were ready to come back for more oysters before we left. *Left same review on their fb page but just happy for anyone else passing through on vacation who gets to visit Chez Delmo - the food, ART & HISTORY!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious!! Service is excellent. Music level perfect. Meals hearty. Menu offers many options. We will be back soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Montreal from the States to celebrate one of those big birthdays that seem to come around on a pretty regular basis. We chose to go to Chez Delmo as a Canadian friend(good friend) had mentioned it to us. As we were staying in old Montreal the Restaraunt was within easy walking distance from our hotel so we decided to walk and got there just as it was opening at 6pm on a Saturday night in August. We were greeted by a delightful young man who we later found out was the co-owner of the restaurant. He really set the tone for our visit- the staff was extremely attentive and attractive an catered to our needs. We started with escargot which was good but not exceptional- but what came next was out of this world. I ordered the Salmon tartar and I must say that I have had this dish in different restaraunt's around the world and Chez Delmo delivered best of class. My wife had a fresh fish Dory course which she really enjoyed. Washing  down a great meal with a refreshing Sav Blanc from France, which for the price was a steal. The piece du resistance was when my wife's creme brûlée arrived. It arrived with one lit candle celebrating my wife's birthday, thanks to Adam's thoughtfulness. We had a great evening and will be visiting Chez Delmo during our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"My favorite Go To spot in Montreal! Have been each year for the last 4 years and it's just as amazing each time. My favorite is the Seafood pasta, quite expensive at $54 a plate, but definitely worth the splurge! The service is awesome and always attentive and helpful with any questions we might have! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Having just arrived in Montreal, this meal was so perfect we almost wanted to pack up and leave the next morning. Even though we had no reservation, were decidedly rough from a long drive up from Washington DC, the hostess sat us at a lovely table and soon were we're sipping wine and relishing the best escargot I have had including my travels in Europe. My 16 yo daughter, for whom the trip was a college tour started with the cheese plate and discovered she had never known what great cheese tasted like before. My 18 y o son had the outstanding seafood poutine and my poached salmon with hollandaise was prepared perfectly. My daughters scallops meirneire were delectable, and the charming owner stopped by not just to inquire if everything was to our liking, but to charmingly confess that while the salmon was from Quebec the scallops were from Massachusetts. We finished with a traditional pouding  of white cake with maple syrup and ice cream that was perfection. The only thing better than the meal was the wonderful warm welcoming service. After driving many hundreds of miles, we were utterly restored and had a lovely stroll until 1 AM around old Montreal thanks to this wonderful restaurant. Je t'adore Montreal. Merci beaucoups Chez Delmo."}
{"text":"Chez Delmo was so far the best sea food I have ever had. Great services, fresh food and delicious dishes. I recommended 100%, if you go to Montreal you must have dinner at this place."}
{"text":"This was one of those situations where you don't really know what you have signed up for until you arrive at the restaurant.  This is a fine dining establishment (guess I should have read the Yelp reviews a little more carefully) that has a long rich tradition in Vieux Montreal. My wife and I were in Montreal for the Jazz Festival and we did not dress for a fine dining establishment. With that being said we were not made to feel like we will philistines for wearing shorts (we were wearing colored shirts though) so I give the restaurant a lot of credit for that.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, my wife had the seafood poutine and I had the grilled scallops. These were probably the best scallops I have had in a long time. Before the entree we had two small cups of warm tomato soup. This soup was the best thing we had to eat during our entire trip (and that is really saying something).  As if the amazing food was not enough the service was impeccable (it really can't be beat).  As an added bonus Patrick Stewart came in for dinner just before we left. He sat behind us and did his best to look innocuous."}
{"text":"Great, fresh seafood. We shared the scallops ceviche and salmon tartare as appetizers and they were delicious. A nice spice sauce in the scallops added a great zing to the freshness of the scallops. For main course we shared the lobster BLT and the large seafood salad. After eating the lobster BLT my colleague said, \"I may never be able to another BLT again after this one!\". The seafood salad was rich with lobster and shrimp and the butter lettuce added to the sweetness of the salad. The amount of shrimp and lobster allowed me to have a bite of one of or the other in every bite. We finished it off by sharing the fondant chocolate cake and OMG. Talk about rich and delicious. I only wish there was a little more of the vanilla ice cream to compliment the richness of the cake."}
{"text":"great seafood spot in 'old montreal'.  modest sized dining area - great for lunch"}
{"text":"So yummy! Great service, nice staff, and lovely seafood. Need I say more?! Scallops were perfectly done, and the crab salad  devine."}
{"text":"How good is Chez Delmo? My wife and I visit Montreal every year - a great food city - and two out of three night we will eat here! Benoit the owner runs a tight but friendly ship - always superb seafood deliciously prepared in an intimate setting with personable staff. Right in the heart of Old Montreal - why spend at the touristy restaurants when you can have a guaranteed great meal?? Don't miss the fried calamari appetizer and halibut for entree."}
{"text":"I was vacationing in Montreal with my boyfriend and wanted to treat him to a nice dinner for his birthday. I researched a bunch of websites in order to try and take him for the best meal and Chez Delmo kept popping up. I decided to take him here and after wished I hadn't. The food was just okay. My father has been a wholesale seafood supplier for 30 years so I know my fish and the fish here was nothing to brag about. The dessert was not much better. The atmosphere was pretty dead and empty which didn't make the experience much better. The waitress was friendly and the service wasn't terrible but not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here because of the good reviews online as well as the location was close to our hotel. Both of us had a great time. We had the calamari as an appetizer as well as the scallops and halibut as mains. Both of us had an amazing time and our waitress was fantastic. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a \"high class\" seafood dinner. My boyfriend is pretty cheap and even he said it was worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails, amazing service! We loved our two waiters who gave us great advice on the nightlife. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Amazing. The poutine is beyond delicious and no words to describe it. Just have to taste it. Very romantic and intimate place. Perfect location by hotels in old Montreal and so neat to have a famous chef cooking for you. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Montreal I who lives there and has not yet been. I always tell my friends Togo when visiting. I will be back in the fall once again!"}
{"text":"Che Delmo is an institution in Montreal and as such I had pay it a visit.  So i made a reservation (recommended) and went.  They do have quite an extensive menu, but I went for the obvious and classic choice of oysters to start.   They were good, however having selected their higher option of oysters (there were two choices in the menu) I was satisfied but not impressed.  Also I was not offered a spicy sauce, only cocktail sauce.  I also ordered their assorted cheese plate.  This was really good, it offered three different types (two of them creamy) of cheese with crostinis.  Then as mains we got mussels with fries and lobster roll which it also came with a side of fries.  By far my favorite ended being the lobster roll.  Big chunks of lobster in between a delicious buttery roll.  To end my meal I had the creme brule.  It was decadent and deliciously executed.  The service was good, but they do come off as a little unfriendly if you do not have reservations.  Overall it was a great meal and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Friendly and top rate service. Christopher is a great bartender and the co-owners, Adam and Benoit are incredibly kind. Seafood was fantastic and the 5 a 7 produced amazing oysters. Salmon tartare and lobster rolls reminded us of New York. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Howdy!  On Tuesday we arrived at 17h25 to be very rudely told to go away because they were not open. As you can see on the right hand column, they open at 17h30.  I'm fond of saying that good service can save bad food, but great food cannot save bad service.   This was a case of horrible service.   On the good side, the rudeness ended up saving us at least $150 if not more.  People who know me, know about my restaurant list (for those who don't it is available at zeke.com), needless to say Chez Delmo has been removed from it."}
{"text":"As I've noticed in Montreal, the decor was amazing. A tower of skipping stones, art drawn on the walls, and written beneath it \"From wine what sudden friendship springs,\" a quote they love enough to print on all of the wine glasses.  The bread was wonderfully soft with a crunchy crust. It's always a good sign when you ask for more bread and don't feel like you're wasting your appetite. Our waitress was very friendly, and we received a small spoonful of their tomato soup to try. As to the main courses, the grilled Arctic char was very flavorful, and the provencal halibut was delicious in a garlic sauce.  Unfortunately, those were the items my dining partners ordered. I received the poached salmon with hollendaise sauce and a salad on the side. The greens tasted a little unwashed, but not enough to ignore. The few bites of broccoli and cauliflower were blander than I expected. And apparently poaching a salmon is a good way to drain some of the taste. I tried using the hollendaise to give it some flavor, but the sauce wasn't very exciting as well. I'll never leave salmon uneaten, but I wouldn't order that dish again.  It's a nice restaurant, and I would give the wait staff 4 stars, but overall this is a 3.5, rounded down for the multitude of restaurant choices in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the finest meals and service I've experienced in a very long time. Each dish was exquisitely prepared and delicious, from the escargot to salmon tartare to creme brulee. The Cod melted in your mouth. The wine selection is artfully curated and suggested, with an attentive staff and warm ambiance. On our way out, the owner called us over to share a bottle of wine and told us a bit about his life. All in all, a fantastic, memorable dining experience I cannot recommend highly enough! I trust you'll treasure this little gem of a spot as much as I will!"}
{"text":"Great experience! In fact, we went twice during our trip to Montreal. The lobster club is delicious, nice selection of wine, great service, very friendly staff...thank you, Benoit!"}
{"text":"Too expensive - weird decor - limited selection - attentive staff but you pay way too much for the \"privilege\" of being there. Sorry but it has better choices in the area."}
{"text":"I go over there practically every time I'm in Montreal and have never been disappointed. From the escargots to the rack of lamb by way of the \"Pate de Foie\". One of the best spots in Montreal. Also ask Chris for his expression shots you'll be ready for the rest of the evening in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Old Montreal and I've been there a few times now.   My recommendation for starter is the tuna tartare. It's really well seasoned and tasty.   For main, the fish and chips is just amazing. Its a good size if you get the large one (2 pieces) and is probably the tastiest fish and chips I've found in Canada. So moist and perfectly well cooked.   Service is excellent and waiters are expert with great knowledge of the menu. Wine list is also very good.   I will definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The decor is just ok but everything else is fantastic. The \"small\" mixed seafood salad and the Wallay fish were incredible. I think that was the nicest meunière fish I've ever had.   Our server was fantastic too. She spent the time to joke around with us a bit and made us feel like regulars.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Such a horrible experience , me and my friend were walking yesterday to coffee in Notre Dame street we stopped by this place to read the menu we found a man who is smoking outside said it's very nice place so my friend said let's get in and try the small dishes so I told her fine let's try. The waitress were very nice people and we ordered two dishes, tomato soup and salmon with vegetable. We get them without any bread. We asked them to bring some, they brought four tiny pieces. my friend finished them and we asked for some more bread and when the waitress went to get it the owner got very very very mad and angry and started yelling at him so he brought for us two tiny small pieces with the menu and asked us to order more. I was surprised and shocked. I stopped eating and we asked for the cheque and I told him what I saw. he answered it's the house rule and went out and the owner followed us to explain that when we just pay 35$ how he could survive. I felt in the moment that we were homeless and we asked for free food , what I got he is so inhuman and I would never recommend it to anyone because we have money to eat and pay. imagine if there is a real homeless person in need, he would kick him out without even thinking. such a troubled night and shocking experience.m"}
{"text":"We had a great time having drinks at the bar.  We had a great conversation with the owner Benoit who treated us like family.  Very large fish selection which is fantastic.  A definite must go if you are going to dinner in Vieux Montreal.  You must and I mean must try the tomato soup.  Better than anything I've ever tasted which involves tomatoes, soup or sauce (and I am Italian).  The recipe has been passed down by the owners of the restaurant since the 1930s."}
{"text":"We came here for oyster happy hour. Oysters were fresh and cheap and we ordered a bottle of champagne to go with. Service was really good and we could smell other peoples dishes from far away they smelled amazing we decided to come back here for dinner next time."}
{"text":"The food here is nothing short of perfection. The staff is something dreams are made of. The bar maid/ service  Elise is friendly, knowledgeable and informative of the menu. Everything served is beyond excellence. The actual owner took the time to have my husband and I sample wine to accompany our meals. I cannot say enough to what this place offers. The oysters were sweet and plump with a gorgeous salinity that reminded me of the air when I was on the boat. The escargot meddled the garlic, butter and oil in a dance that was heaven. The seafood poutine was a one in a life time experience. Seriously get the seafood poutine. I had the clams with anchovies and linguine which literally made my face form a smile. It's in the heart of Montreal so it was easily a desirable to walk or commute to."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, beautiful people and amazing food!  We randomly searched for a resto with oysters since we were craving them so much! We decided to try this place out. Never heard of it and we decided to wing it and swing by.  We were happy to have valet service. Started really well. The hostess greeted us with a smile. She took our coats and told us to chose any seat we liked. It was pretty busy but the environment felt so calm and peaceful even though there were a lot of people. It had a romantic and calming atmosphere. The lights were dimmed the lovely candles glowing on every table ahh how beautiful.  We ordered our favourites (oysters, oysters and more oysters) yummy they were Deeelicious. We also ordered scampis and my bf ordered the arctic char. Our food was very succulent. Wow that butter tasted like real butter!! everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  Service was phenomenal. Waitresses were so quick and friendly.  I swear I did not expect much but after leaving this fine resto of over 80 years they really set the bar high for montreal. They are Amazing I am definitely coming back here again for more seafood delight."}
{"text":"Tried the oysters, grilled salmon and creek brûlée. All were amazing! They also make great cocktails"}
{"text":"Cute place, service was very nice.  Their tomato cream soup was some of the best I've had, the oysters were fresh, shucked properly and delicious. The lobster and dessert were tasty as well."}
{"text":"I went to Chez Delmo for a bachelorette party last summer. We all loved seafood so we decided on this place. However the food itself didn't wow me like I had hoped for this upscale restaurant. The clam chowder and lobster pasta were good, but I've had better elsewhere.   The restaurant is very well situated in the old port, so it would be an ideal romantic spot for a date. Finding parking can be quite difficult though so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Went there with a party of 5.  Me and my girlfriend got there early sat at the bar for oysters and a glass of wine. Oysters were great.  It all went down the pipe during the main meal.  This gotta be the worst value in town.  $40 for a plate you can get for $12.95 anywhere else.  Not bad food but nothing more than pub fare but presented as if it's fine dining at its best.  Sorry but the reputation is way over rated and it felt like a place that probably was a fine dining restaurant in a different decade, 40 years ago.    I'll give them the service which was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Asked around for a unique dessert in Montrèal and was told about the mille fuille at Chez Delmo. It was amazing along with their chocolate hazelnut torte! Had a bellini too. Our bartender was really great to talk to. Will go again when I'm back in Canada."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our Hotel concierge. The atmosphere was really nice and settle, the food was amazing on all count. The service was friendly but real slow. So overall we had a great experience, but please have more staff."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  The place has a great vibe. Not too quiet and not too noisy.. Just perfect for a business lunch. The food was awesome. I had the scallop ceviche as an entree which was very fresh and melted in my mouth.  For the main course, i tried the beer battered fish and chips. By far the best I tasted in Montreal. The staff was very attentive and the service was great. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, wonderful meal - mostly.  Our entire family went for my birthday.  At first glance it appeared to be a simple bistro, but the food was amazing.  Two of us had the Seafood Shell Au Gratin, one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  My son declared the lamb was the best he's ever had; my husband enjoyed the Walleye, and my daughter the Mussels Frites.  Our server was pleasant and accommodating (with custom drinks).  Only odd thing was I watched him make a drink at the bar, taste it with a bar straw, then put the straw back in the drink and serve it to my daughter.  Didn't want to say anything, but that was gross and lost them a star."}
{"text":"Decent food but definitely a bit over priced. We had our first meal here at Montreal since everything was busy and we enjoyed it. Slightly fancy place and good for dates too!   They told us that they specialize in seafood so we had their freshly shucked oysters, seafood pasta and scallop ceviche. Have to admit that their oysters surprised me because I didn't know there are fresh oysters in Montreal - they were definitely very fresh. Their seafood pasta was also very good, giant scallops and the sauce was creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"We had the Chilean sea bass and fish and chips.  All delicious!  For dessert, creme brûlée of course! Also very good."}
{"text":"Fancy ambience but was not impressed by the food. My calamari appetizer was very chewy.  Halibut was a bit overcooked and underseasoned.  My wife had the sea food pasta which was nice. Lots of lobster but again felt the lobster was a bit overcooked (chewy)."}
{"text":"I believe that there's a reason why only tourists are giving this place 4 & 5 stars, because as a local, I am so not a fan of Chez Delmo. The space itself has potential to be quite lovely, but the 'sketches' on the wall cheapened the whole look for me and the bar stools are far too close to the bar which was lined with hard, sticking out stones which your knees constantly bang into if you're over 5'6\"; you have to eat sideways if you don't want bruised knees as these stools can't be moved.  We ordered 2 cocktails, the lobster rolls and the mussels. The drinks were pretty solid actually: tasty, fresh ingredients and made right in front of us with a great presentation. The lobster rolls though, it comes with 2 small rolls and a tiny ramaquin of fries for 34$...but if you wanted to make it a share plate, then you had to add 7,50$...what?!?  The mussels arrived next and they had almost zero white wine sauce in the bottom, weird. Upon trying to eat them, half of them were sticking to the shells and they had a really funky smell and taste...basically inedible. I hate sending food back, but we told the waitress as nicely as possible that these mussels were unacceptable and that perhaps they shouldn't be serving them. She then took the plate back to the kitchen where they all had a taste of them. She came back and proudly stated \"There is nothing at all wrong with them, they just have a strong 'lake' taste...you're not going to get sick or anything.\" Seriously?? And last time I checked, they come from the ocean.  We weren't charged for the mussels and were comped a piece of cake for the ordeal which was actually quite tasty, it was a chocolate layered cake with fresh fruit on top; still, we left with a bitter taste in our mouths and a pretty pricey bill. If I want to drop this kind of money in our fair city, there are sooooo many other places that I'd go to first."}
{"text":"Excellent service, et très bonne cuisine... Le filet mignon avec sa sauce au poivre est délicieux."}
