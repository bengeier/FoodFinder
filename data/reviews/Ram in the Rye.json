{"text":"Had the chicken Caesar salad with dressing on side.. nice they asked about bacon..  so its good that there are some Halal options on the menu.  Over all feel is cheap eats with cheep booze.  Solid little known patio!  Will try pouting next time because fries are really good!"}
{"text":"$6.99/lbs for wings. (Wednesday)  Cheap pitchers!  What else can u ask for?  Pretty dark inside, however that really didn't bother me too much. Friendly wait staff. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Holy shit this place used to be okay now it's legit bad. I'd rather pay $28 for sushi dinner ayce. Menu is horrible now..doesn't even have nachos...like what?  5 mains total...2/5 of them are curry lol.  The fish n chips doesn't look that bad though"}
