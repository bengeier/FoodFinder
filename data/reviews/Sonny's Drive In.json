{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Sonnys burgers at all. Yes, you can load it with you usual ingredients, just the same as Harvey's. The burgers looked like the thawed frozen type. Def not fresh and home made. 
I also got the poutine. I enjoyed the gravy, but they don't use cheese curds. The fries were good, and the portion was massive. 
The chicken fingers were your usual deep fried fingers that you can get from a box at home, nothing special. 
I don't see myself going out of my way to go again. But if I do end up there, I won't complain either."}
{"text":"good prices, the food is pretty good. never had a problem with undercooked food there, never seen anything unsanitary. service is fast, and I've been going there for 20 years. 
Not something I want to eat all the time - very heavy food. but sometimes you just have to have it."}
{"text":"All in all, this is a great burger joint. Reminds me of Apache burger or Jumbo burger in Toronto. 

Toppings are fresh, burgers are preformed but cooked decently. They wrap the burgers in tinfoil so they hold in the flavor really well. I had the banquet burger and loved it. The poutine was a total flop, since they use shredded mozzarella instead of cheese curds. A burger is $5,50, no fountain drinks and just expensive bottled drinks. This place is just ok. Nothing special.

Staff were bitchy and rude, and the burger was nothing special. I wont go here again. Even asking what the topping were resulted in sarcastic comments and rude body language."}
{"text":"The employees are mostly ass holes.  Especially the tall guy that works nights with the tattoos. But who cares. It's a fast food joint. They arent working for tips. They make awesome food that's cheap and doesn't make me feel disgusting like when I get drive thru at a chain place. That's all that matters.

 I can watch them cook my food to order whether I got a double cheeseburger or was feeling healthy and ordered a chicken souvlaki. Wish they had more topping options than lettuce tomato pickle onion mustard and BBQ sauce. Would it kill them to open a can of mushrooms? 

seriously. Go. The burgers are worth more than the $4.50 they cost for the taste and size of them."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Sonnys I thought it was just another restaurant. When my friends took me I really enjoyed it. I like how it's open pretty damn late. They let you choose your toppings which is always great. 
I always get a pound of suicide wings with a jumbo cheese dog. Yum"}
{"text":"Good for when the hunger strikes late at night. 
Good crispy fries and OK burger.
Good wings as well."}
{"text":"Late night food at its best. Banquet burger is the go to. Always fresh and made in front of u. Love that they're open super late too"}
{"text":"This place is shit!! Chicken has no flavour fries are soggy and the lady with the glasses that makes your burger with her bare hands and her dirty nails hates her job and is a complete bitch!!! Save your money and go next door for a toonie Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Food is totally garbage, poutine, unless youre using cheese curds dont call it poutine, the sauce horrible. i also ordered a burger, patties are frozen not fresh. I would never eat here again"}
{"text":"Not really impressed.. the burger buns are dry and the fries have this taste that lets you know they were previously frozen. Nothing from sonny's really stands out to me other than the fact that they are open late!"}
{"text":"Not like Johnny's on Vic Park but the closest I will get in Brampton. 
Not Bad, but Not as good as my Scarborough burger joint."}
{"text":"The main thing with Sonny's, is that its in Brampton which doesn't seem to have anything worth noting for food when you go away from chain restaurants.  

Lick's still has the best burgers in Brampton, and is better than Sonny's.

However, late at night when you're drunk is when Sonny's seems to be delicious.  Realistically, its only because of the alcohol effect.  When I used to live in Brampton, I thought this place was great but that was simply because it was all I knew.  Now, it pales in comparison to similar \"dives\" when I look back.  

Its also not a cheap place, and might actually even be more expensive than Licks."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the poutine after seeing the mouthwatering pictures on yelp. It wasn't the best poutine but pretty satisfying for a late night craving and worth the huge portion size. The downfall is this place looks a bit sketchy and old also they only take cash."}
{"text":"I really like Sonny's! Been a family fav for a while (even the location in Waterloo) and Sonny's does not disappoint if you want late night food. They are a no frills burger joint that also does roast beef sandwiches, fish, as well as souvlaki. I've only ever had the burgers here because you can't go wrong with their generously sized charcoal fired burger. When you need a late night bite that will satisfy that burger craving, don't discount Sonny's!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Brampton. The burger was grilled to perfection and the poutine was out of control. Portions are very American-esque and the price is great. They also have an expanded menu that I'm looking forward to try in the future. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"This burger joint has been around for a long time. I had a banquet burger there yesterday. Not a gourmet burger by any means, but it was a solid honest  burger. It was better than McDonalds and its ilk. Sonny's reminds me of the original Harvey's in Toronto before that burger joint became just another chain."}
{"text":"If you want great food for a great price sonny's it's the place to go! I usually get the banquet burger with a poutine the gravy is very yummy and the fries are crispy"}
{"text":"I love Sonny's. The food you get could last you 3 meals. The only down fall is. It is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Banquet burger - your classic burger with cheese and bacon!

I love a place that makes a burger for you in front of you. 
Behind the glass i chose my toppings and watched them build my masterpiece. 
I shared fries and a coke with my sexy companion. I suggest sharing fries because they are massive! 
The burger was juicy and loaded, thanks to me! :)

They have picnic tables outside to enjoy the sun, otherwise it truly is just a drive-in and pick up your food and go. Remember lots of napkins.. you will need them! Trust me!

I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This B-town 'landmark' has been held close to my heart since I was a little burger-hungry kid, but I'll try to write a neutral review, now that I'm a grown burger-hungry man.

It must be noted that in terms of dining, Brampton mainly sucks the big one. Sure there are a couple of exceptions, but you'll mostly find only chain restaurants around these parts. You just try taking your significant other to a romantic Denny's dinner, I dare you!

Anyway, I think this is why I still love Sonny's. It hasn't tried to be anything but what they've always been: quick, cheap late-night food in a pinch for all the drunks and night owls. And at 2:30am, your options are limited to Sonny's, Denny's, and McDonalds.

The location sucks, and I really wish that could change. The area is so ghetto, I usually lose my appetite if I drive down Church St. home. Nothing like driving by a 90-year old looking crackhead hooker being jacked by the cops to taint your burger-lust. But anyway.

The restaurant doesn't feature any seating (save for a few picnic tables outside). The staff is always friendly, cracking jokes, and serve with a smile.

The food itself is way better than it should be for the price. The fries are all homemade, and while I'm not a fan of poutine, it should be noted that Sonny's poutine is tasty for me, and downright orgasmic for regular Poutiners. Their burgers are delicious, the toppings are always fresh, and pretty much everything on the menu is quality. I have yet to try their new chicken wings, but I imagine they won't let me down on that either.

Oh, and the crap about the fire changing the quality of their food is just that, crap. For better or worse, nothing has changed. What you see is what you get."}
{"text":"A great, classic burger joint.  Good portions.  No classy decor.... But then again, I didn't go there expecting that.  The only downside is that it's a cash only business.  Hit the bank machine before you go or take advantage of the ATM they have on-site.  I forgot to take a picture of my delicious banquet burger before it met it's demise!"}
{"text":"Food tastes great, decent price. Lack of seating and lack of debit is why two stars are being taken off. They have an ATM there that charges you out of this world (I'm assuming they get a cut) it's 2014 get debit. The staff here are very hipstery which I don't like either... But the food is really delicious here. Plus it's open really late and has saved me a few times."}
{"text":"I feel that this beat Johnny's Burger in Scarborough. Yea, I said it! haha.

The Burgers are bigger, more variety on their menu, and they offer a deadly Poutine! I've brought some and suggested this diner hangout to some friends and people have mixed reviews about the Poutine. First off, they don't have cheese curds, but cheese strings. Personally I feel it covers more. Another thing that's a plus... No matter how deep you go in the poutine, the fries are always CRISPY!!

The proportions are great! Not stingee and filling! The prices, I guess are pretty average these days. Under $12 for a Banquet Burger, poutine and bottled drink.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
- Poutine"}
{"text":"I definitely think they have the best burgers in Brampton/Mississauga ! 
I usually like mine well done and I'm very picky but I always find it they rush your food when telling them what u want on it . Owner with mustash needs to be more friendlier!"}
{"text":"I'm not a long term resident, so it's not an institution for me. I'll say they have good fresh cut fries, but everything else is pretty average. More specifically, the beef patty is average (or even below) which brings the whole experience down. They do have a lot of options for a make-your-own burger style; but when it's just on a bland, frozen hockey puck patty, it can only bring up the experience so much."}
{"text":"Meh.  Lots of hype for processed meat burgers and processed cheese.  Veggie Ingredients were made fresh.  Service was fast and friendly but no we here to sit and food had to be driven home and was cold by the time we got there. I ate more fries than anything. Biggest thing I enjoyed was the classic milkshake. Sucked that thing back fast on the drive home.  I recommend the milkshake."}
{"text":"Sonys hits the spot everytime! It's food that you definitely crave. Whether you're hungover or just looking for real good grub. Order up a burger and they call you up to dress your burger the way you want it. And better come hungry because the portions are more than decent. Burgers fries and a shake at that price can't be beat."}
{"text":"I'd say its the best burger joint in town.  Its a big ol'burger with good toppings. Keep it simple though. They get messy when you put too many toppings on them. I recommend starting with a regular hamburger or cheeseburger.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Sonnys have been serving up nourishing fare for the late night reveler since before I can remember.

I spend a lot of time in Quebec for business, so I like to think I \"know my poutine\". 

Sonny's stacks up against the best of them."}
{"text":"Food match the price. Nothing fancy but does the job...beats the fast food joints and for sure five guys. With the try, especially as a late night option. The fried sides are good. The patties are basic and nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This review is JUST for their Horrible Service.
I went in late at night to this sketchy looking place, that looks like they should have an armed Security Officer late at night. It's well lit inside, but outside its dark so you wouldn't be able to read the license plate if there is a shooting.

I looked at the menu, not having eaten all day and I was tired.
I ask if the \"special\" which comes with a drink, is a can or comes from the fountain.

The guy behind the counter literally says \"Can't You read?\"
The special was only good Tuesday and its wasn't Tuesday.
So My fault I guess for not reading closer, and his fault for being a BITTER guy in his late 40's working the graveyard shift in a bad burger joint.
 
They also DO NOT take Credit Cards.
So..Bad Service, No Credit Cards, and DARK Parking lot.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I say the food falls under the umbrella of decent fast food. The burgers are good. You choose your toppings, sauces, and grilled onions. The regular order of fries and especially onion rings is gigantic! I'd consider it over consumption to munch up that pile of onion rings! But you just have to. Watch out for the seagulls when eating at their picnic tables, they're hungry."}
{"text":"I love Sonny's! You have to take it for what it is -an old burger joint. Obviously it's quite different from the more gourmet burger joints that have popped up today but this place does a pretty good job at satisfying the craving for a greasy burger and solid fries! I also love the chicken fingers here, they are yummy!! I love that its open late - its a big step up from going to McDonalds or Wendy's!"}
{"text":"sonnys has been an institution for years, good burgers can hang out, the whole bit, as a brampton resident I was dissappointed when there was a fire there a couple of years ago but they have reopened its the same ol sonnys  (including staff) lots of parking, opened late and just a tip, they have a special on tuesday,,, theonly negative is the area, some rough people around the area especially at night,,, something they cant control."}
{"text":"used to love coming here for late night snacks until the day I asked for lettuce on my burger.  The answer I received was \"THIS IS NOT A SALAD BAR\".  My response was \"IM SORRY BUT EVERY BURGER JOINT IN THE WORLD HAD LETTUCE AT THEIR RESTAURANTS\"  None the less I ate my burger with out lettuce.  The food is not bad especially if you are looking for late night eats but WARNING DO NOT ASK FOR LETTUCE you might get kicked out.

The attitude that comes from this places forces me to give 1 star.  If it wasn't for the attitude I give it 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service is friendly, but the food is TERRIBLE! Burgers are definitely from frozen, and the poutine had this off flavour it smelled like cinnamon in the gravy. Do not get the burgers here!"}
{"text":"People in Brampton pretend to love this place because we're just desperate for any sense of culture or connection in a city that has none. Rallying around a greasy burger joint probably isn't the way to fix that but it's been open for years so that's what people seem to do.

The food is alright. That's why they get 2 stars. I like their soulvaki and their house made fried onions are awesome. But the whole place just seems dirty and grungy. Including the staff. Who are all pretty rude for who knows what reason. It feels like you're being served by ex-convicts who served hard time.

No combos, nowhere to sit except a couple of picnic tables outside, and they don't accept anything besides cash. A resounding meh."}
{"text":"I love, love their banquet burger I go there almost every weekend. Yet until my today's order that was so disappointing. I came around 1.30 pm to the store and got my usual order, banquet with relish, fried onion, with mustard, ketchup and mayo. While I'm waiting for them to ask me what I wanna put on my burger I overheard other customers saying the young lady that in charge of putting the condiments on the burger put toooo much of things more that she supposed to. I wasn't really aware. 

First disappointment: I got home and found my burger wasn't wrapped properly, my burger was literally outside of the wrapper. Gross 
Second disappointment: SHE LITERALLY PUT WAY WAY too much relish and mustard. And you can imagine how sour my banquet is. 

I really really love their burger, but if this keep happening I won't come back."}
{"text":"Disgusting if nowhere else is open and you have to choose between this unsanitary crap hole and McDonald's choose McDonald's and that's saying a lot because I hate McDonald's. If you don't like sanitary or tasty food or you need to find a two dollar whore or a crack dealer go here. The place smells nasty the people working there are disgusting where no plastic gloves pick their noses while working with food and look like they just got paroled from jail the whole experience is nauseating. They hide toppings like lettuce and tetziki sauce under the table so if you do somehow wind up here and want that stuff you gotta ask for it it won't be offered. Since Brampton is a crap hole and this place is a crap hole I guess they deserve each other..."}
{"text":"This place is very much over hyped by the locals.  It is open late and the burgers and poutine are average.  Joe was right to point out that the crowd is pretty intimidating at night.  The restaurant is located along the same strip that is frequented by street walkers."}
{"text":"So I read the mixed reviews and decided still to go and try the poutine at least.   Ended up getting a cheese burger as well.  

Both ordered burgers and split the poutine.  

I would say my burger was pretty decent in terms of toppings and they did have lettuce but it was under the counter for some reason.  Asked for hot sauce. .. it was weak lol 

Burger definitely looked processed to the max.  I figure they could at least go to a grocery store and find better I have no idea where they source it!  It was messy but I can't complain since it is kind of expected.  It wasn't that great to begin with.  

Poutine.. can't see why people are even talking about this?  Fries were over- cooked and depressing.   

I will go to McDonald's next time I want late night eat or nothing at all I guess cause Brampton in general sucks."}
{"text":"GREAT food, low AFFORDABLE prices and great people!  Love the banquet burgers, the poutine and the homemade gravy."}
{"text":"It's food you'd eat if you were planning to get drunk, really. The place is cash only, though most of their items are either bland tasting or missing seasoning or seem watered down. I get theyre trying to promote cooking with charcoal which I like, but some of the food if not all of it appears to be processed...

Like I said, I don't plan on eating this for a late night snack unless me and the buds are in town and really want something that isn't McDonalds at 1 AM in the morning."}
{"text":"They're open really, really late. Having been a suburbanite my entire life, I can really appreciate when restaurants have late hours.

I guess I was really lucky to have beaten the 3:30am rush... Cause strangely, that's the time that this tiny takeout fast food joint started to get packed (they close at 4).

I had the banquet burger (hamburger with cheese and bacon) and a poutine. This was pretty standard late night diner food, and it was satisfying. The burger was a generous size for the $5 I paid, and the poutine, while it wasn't the traditional style with cheese curds, was still delicious. 

I mean, I didn't come here with expectations of a life-changing experience - just solid late night fast food. That's definitely what I got, and I'm happy with the result."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from a Brampton native,  I knew this place had to be on my list to try.  
First impression was that the building looked old and tired.  I understand this vintage look is part of the charm.  
There is no seating inside,  everything is take out and cash only.  
The service was great,  I asked what was the most popular and I was told the banquet burger, so I got it with fries and a drink.  
I had high hopes for the taste as the meat is charbroiled, but looking at the pre-formed pressed patty pucks on the grill cooking made me sad.  
Starting with the positives,  the fries are awesome,  huge portion,  hand cut,  cooked just right.  The burger toppings were pretty good,  nice pickles,  decent tomato and my choice of condiments. 
Biggest draw back was the meat, pure disappointment.  My fears became a reality when I felt the weird texture of this floppy meat patty.  It's just not good quality beef. Seems to be mostly fillers with a rubbery texture and no beef flavour.  Such a waste to boast a charbroiled grill but not make your own real beef patties. 
This place has a huge following as I bet many Brampton natives grew up eating here and have nostalgic feelings for the food that keeps them coming back.  To a first timer like myself,  the taste and quality did not deliver and I won't likely be back."}
{"text":"Sure, Sonny's is a little hyped by the \"locals\". Technically, I've always been a local but I didn't hear about Sonny's until I went to school in Toronto. I thought I was missing out on something spectacular all these years, even with it being a stones throw away from the Canadian Tire (now a Shopper's Drug Mart) that I would visit often.

To correct this supposed wrong, I visited Sonny's. 

Maybe it was the over-sell, maybe it was the quality, but I found Sonny's to be good, not great. Their burgers are comparable to any Harvey's. It's not a bad thing, I actually go somewhat often, it's just not a life-changing experience. 

I usually order their banquet burger, a side order of fries with gravy and a drink. It comes out to around $10. Their burgers are pretty big and the serving of fries is even bigger. Definitely show up with an appetite.

On that note, show up with somewhere to sit as well. There is no indoor seating and only about 4 picnic tables outside. There are plenty of parking spots, so sticking with the drive-in theme, life is easier if you're mobile. 

Lastly, the area is a little sketchy. It's fine during the day, though you do get the rush of teenagers from Central Peel High, but at night it definitely isn't somewhere you'd like to set up camp. Street-walkers and gangsters frequent the area, and unless you're looking for a lady of the night to go with your fries, I wouldn't stick around too long."}
{"text":"This Brampton tradition is famous for one thing: fries and gravy! Of course I also order a double burger with cheese and LOAD it with fried onions - something not often found at most burger joints.

But the fries, and particularly the gravy, is legendary. The gravy is rich and flavorful. Adding cheese gives you poutine, but personally I'd stick with just fries and gravy. The portion is generous and to take full benefit of that, order a half and half. That's half fries, half onion rings. Get gravy on the side to douce your fries while keeping the rings clean for ketchup. That's like having two sides with your yummy burger!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, despite \"raving reviews\" 
truth is, not much competition for food around town, especially late nights. I enjoy five guys over this 

oily and disturbingly unsanitary"}
{"text":"Great place

Love the banquet burger with onion rings
Get gravy
Ask for hot sauce for the burgers"}
{"text":"Did not expect to actually like this place, I figured because it was inexpensive, the food quality would reflect that... I was pleasantly surprised. It's a true gem with great food and a casual atmosphere. Staff are very pleasant and wonderful people. Great experience overall, I highly recommend the banquet burger."}
{"text":"If you know Brampton, sonny's is iconic. Long time resident. Even went through a major fire and returned. Good burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Great old school Burger drive in , in the heart of Brampton ...
Been here now 3 times and it's fairly good .
Poutine is great burgers are great .
I mean to be fair I still have my personal best favourite burger spot in the city but because that spot is far I come here to save time ! 
Staff is friendly and everything on the menu is very tasty ! 
If you haven't been then give them a try !"}
{"text":"Just came back from sonny's this morning. It had been a while, but is my go to spot for fries and gravy. They have a Tuesday combo deal I have had a few times too. Quick service. Came in ordered went out to car for 2-3 minutes to sit with my dog came back and was ready for me. It was pretty busy at the time too so the quick speed really helps. 

You want good fries and gravy.... This is the spot!

 I think they have one of the best fries in Brampton hands down."}
{"text":"Although it was my friend who got take out from here tonight, I've had it a million times, what Brampton'er hasn't..  I have a soft spot for this basic burger joint basically so I'll give it the 4/5 rating, but clearly the burgers are frozen and from a box just like most of their other items including chicken fingers, onion rings, and most of the rest of the menu.  That being said, they're open until 4 or 5 AM every night when usually the only other things open are a McDonalds or Wendy's..  Poutine and fresh cut fries are probably the highlight, as those are homemade from scratch and not frozen or commercial sourced like most of the rest of the menu.  Every city has one of these places.  Like Apache in Etobicoke, Johnny's in Scarborough, Zet's by the Airport, etc. 

The fact they still refuse to have lettuce after all these years irritates me though, especially with chicken souvlaki or grilled chicken sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"It was a nice treat to have a classic Sonny's cheese burger. Since I don't leave and work in the area anymore, I don't get to visit this place much. 
Although the burgers are amazing, they're still big box patties. 
And they seriously need to get over that Cash only BS. That was so 10 years ago, I mean come on its f-ing 2016, stop being so cheap. That little debit or credit card fee won't kill you. You jus charged me $12.48 for a burger fries and drink. These guys need to get with the time before they're forced to close down."}
{"text":"The burgers and onion rings are great. Since they switched from real milkshakes to the kind they have now it's been a let down. I get it, keep up with technology..... But if that's the case why don't they accept debit?"}
{"text":"These guys are a Brampton institution; but since moving downtown, I have to ask myself why...I guess their fries are good? If you want a proper burger and fries, save your money, drive downtown and go to a Burger's Priest instead (or hell, even Five Guys)"}
{"text":"Would recommend as a great late-night alternative to McDonalds. I order the banquet burger pretty much every time i go and they haven't disappointed me yet! Portion sizes are great too, the one order of fries is easily enough for 2 people.

My only complaint is that I would prefer if they wore gloves while handling my burger. I understand they wash their hands often, it's just a pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"If you're craving for a tasteful burger (chicken or beef) then you should try this place. It's a take-out cash ONLY place but I must say it has some of the best burgers in Brampton. They also have poutine, fish and chips which is just good. Must try the pulled pork sandwich and the cheeseburger with bacon."}
{"text":"I'm usually not too picky about food but dang this place is questionable to put it nicely. This place is open late so it is good if you are hungry and in the area but when places like Denny's open all day I would never pick this place.

Sometimes what you don't know won't hurt you is a good mantra to adopt when they are preparing your food."}
{"text":"A solid option to fill a burger craving if in the area.  However, in the area there is not much competition.  They do good for what they are but not on the same level as places like Johnny's or Apache.
Also, cash only... do have a bank machine onsite which helps."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time today and thank god I did. Amazingggg food!! And great customer service. My new favourite place."}
{"text":"I must say that I'm confused with the negative reviews, especially the ones that discuss the cleanliness of this establishment.  My husband's cousins are from Brampton (born and raised) and have been going to Sonny's all their lives and continue to rave about the burgers, fries, etc.

After Tinnel's (Jamaican patties), we stopped in to grab some grub because, every time my husband comes out that way, he always stops in.  We split a banquet burger and each had fries and gravy (I know but it's okay once in a while).  Anyway, the food was superb and the portions were huge - better than Johnny's and Apache in my opinion.  From the outside, it looks like it could be a dive but, trust me, it's super clean inside.  The staff were super friendly and packed up everything with care, gave lots of condiments, napkins, etc.  It appears that the burgers are constantly voted best in Brampton so that should speak for itself.

If I was out in Brampton again and felt like satisfying a guilty pleasure, I'd definitely stop in again - 5/5 hands down!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here as I heard many stories about their burgers. The first thing that shocked me was that they don't use gloves..? Really? It's 2014?? Never mind all the diseases going around. I couldn't believe how many times the guy grilling my buns touched my burger as well as the cashier too. I politely asked the manager why they don't use gloves and he couldn't give me a reason except for his response which was \"We don't use gloves here\". I was taken aback by the area as well. I will never eat here again. Looks very unclean and there food makes me ill from using too much oil. If you want a really good burger in a place that's really clean try Burgers Priest or Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"I luckily stumbled upon this place while desperately trying to find something to eat at 2am (I know). I was very surprised to see something opened till so late; nevertheless I went in. 
Upon walking in I noticed the place did look a little dated, but who cares; as long as the food isn't. I ordered a standard Cheese Burger with Fries, I paid under $10 and I was very satisfied. The burgers are grilled fresh upon order so they do take some time to cook. Condiment selection is slightly odd (They don't have any lettuce, in place of it is sautéed onions). Having said that I topped my burger with the onions any mayo. The burger itself was pretty nice, the onions did a good job as the added a slight saltiness to the burger but it wasn't overbearing. The fries were nice and crispy and didn't seem too oily. As for service, without saying too much; it could be better."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you find on the side of any none-400 series highway on the way up north. It's a drive-in restaurant, meaning you're intended to order your food and then head back to your car to eat.

Look, people who complain about food quality are not getting what this place is for. This place is designed to sell over-sized over-salted and under-priced poutines to drunks after last call. They do that.

One thing I will say is when they decided to add lettuce to the menu, I lost a little bit of respect for the burger-nazi with the moustache. Roll over on your principles that easily, do you?"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 15 years, I do have to say it was better when I was younger. The gravy is different now. The chicken wings are very large and I think they are delicious. Milkshakes are good too. Tuesday before 3pm you can save on a burger, fries and a drink. Service is good."}
{"text":"Had a banquet burger and poutine. Didn't think it was anything special, have had much better burgers before. Poutine was fairy salty didn't end up finishing it. Had been a few years back and now I remember why I hadn't been back, don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Good food especially when your starving !
But my boyfriend didn't really enjoy it, he said it didn't feel like he was eating a homemade burger more like a store bought...I wasn't too picky chicken fingers and poutine was great just the gravy was a little too salty otherwise if your ever in the area try it out !"}
{"text":"Look here's the deal

It is called a greasy spoon for a reason

Gloves? Go back to your chains. Sonny's is an established business and they have been around longer than you've been alive. 

This isn't cuisine it's moderately good food served in big portions for Drunk people. It's also somewhere I would take my nephew for a drive in experience. 

Yeah it's not in a nice part of town but the guys behind the counter are real blue collar guys and if you're not so judgmental you can see they work hard for honest pay. 

You want a fancy burger go somewhere else. You want nostalgia and a good greasy spoon make this your place. 

Banquet onion rings fries and milkshakes. 
Hot dogs are great and the fried onions are tasty. But IT IS NOT GOURMET and that's just fine with me. 

Stay gold Sonny's and throw out the hipsters"}
{"text":"Best burgers anywhere.  I've been coming here for 30 years and have never had a better burger"}
{"text":"Might be an unfair review since the food was cold by the time I drove home and dug my teeth into it. It was okay, the fries were a little inconsistent in length and not evenly cooked. I guess the burgers taste much better hot."}
{"text":"Oh Lord! I think I died and went to heaven. If you are looking for a amazing, fresh well made burger. Forget everywhere else and make this your destination. These guys know what they are doing. It's a small drive in place. There is no where to sit and they only take cash (they have an ATM inside). But they know how to make a burger. It was my first time tonight and it won't be my last. Can not wait to try more stuff on the menu! 
Their gravy is also to die for.
Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sonny's ...USED.. to be the spot !!

I grew up in Brampton and Sonny's was the place to stop in for great onion rings or fries .. great burgers and amazing souvlaki on a bun !! However something changed. I heard a rumour that there was ownership change or something like that or maybe it was the fire a couple years back. After that the food is not close to as good as it was. Or maybe its because when I was in my 20's and teens showing up drunk at 2 am and getting a burger really tastes good at that point. My father used to bring me there when I was a kid and when I became a teen my friends and I would stop in grab some good grubb and hang out in the parking lot. I always would come back at least once a year. Couple years ago I took my wife there and the food was not the same. We came back another time and again just isnt as good as it used to be. I still enjoy it however if you really want a good burger go up the street to Licks its much better ...and im suprised to be saying that as Sonnys was always Bramptons Apache Burger. I will still reccomend it however there food has gone down from long ago. There is also a hotel next to Sonny's that has some odd characters. You will find some people walking the area missing teeth and bumming smokes or change. Dont waste your time driving to Brampton for this spot .. I think its an over hyped legend due to the fact that its an old style burger joint that is open late in Brampton... a place that is boring."}
{"text":"Was here with my friends yesterday for a quick snack .If you are  looking for a quick afternoon  snack  this place does the trick, For a low price  you can get huge portion of fries. It is not gourmet food but its good comfort food. So if you want that  highly recommend it. Ill be back if i am in  the area and i want some tasty fries  or onion rings."}
{"text":"I've been going To Sonny's on and off for almost 20 years. Fries and burgers taste great, but....
How can I put it, perhaps I'll just be straight forward. I'm running to the toilet shortly after. I eat at alot of different burger places, all charbroil their burgers and deepfry the fries. But for some reason I only get the explosive runs when eating at Sonny's. Why do I keep going back ? I keep asking myself that same question when I'm experiencing those warning cramps when you know it's time to run to the toilet. I've finally convinced myself to stop going period."}
{"text":"Fresh cut fries! Poutine is delicious. I'll never go for NYF again. I went back 3 days in a row for the poutine. For less than $6, it is sooo worth it. The portion is ridiculous! Tried the onions rings, they were ok. The staff is nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Meat to bread ratio for the cheese burger is not good at all, bun is too thick for that thin burger. Great taste but wasn't please with that. On another note the POUTINE is a must try! Super tasty and can feed 2 ppl easily"}
{"text":"Great burger joint. You want a no nonsense burger, this is the place to go. I never ask for lettuce tho, always looks old!"}
{"text":"Their fish on a bun is amazing! And their poutine is always awesome! We always come here when we're craving a good ol'burger & fries!"}
{"text":"I always passed this place and never tried it, as I always put it in my bucket list. Yesterday I went there in late evening at 9pm and was the only car. I asked the young kid with lots of ink, on what the most common burger, he recommended the Banquet Burger, as it's the most ordered item. 
It came up to $9.75 with 2 cans of Coke, including tax. 
The patties were undercooked, the burger was just all over the place; I kid you guys not it was the WORST burger ever. The young kid with tattoos doesn't even wear plastic gloves, when handling the burger, the West Indian cook making the fries is wiping his nose, very unsanitary, disgusting, go if you want food poisoning, in which today I took the day off."}
