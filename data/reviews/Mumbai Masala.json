{"text":"I'll have to try more dishes but seems pretty solid. I ordered the one person combo for $17 which comes with butter chicken and palak paneer, papadam, potato samosa, rice, nan and a mango lassi. The butter chicken sauce was good but the chicken itself seemed a tad plain/dry. The palak paneer, mango lassi and nan were good. It was pretty filling and tasty. I'd go back and try other dishes, most of which are $10. There is a decent amount of space in this restaurant."}
{"text":"It gets frigid in Montreal. Who wants to leave the warm house to go get food at 2am when you're hungry but have nothing in the fridge?? No one. To fill that emptiness in your possibly hungover stomach? Ubereats, of course!! It only costs $5 to deliver piping hot food to your door! None of this getting dressed for the sub zero temperatures or freezing your toes off shuffling through the snow or cracking your head open when you fall on ice. Food to your door for $5! So worth it!   I downloaded the app and had a hard time verifying all my credit card info and this and that, that when I ordered from Mumbai Masala, I forgot one dish. Oh well, maybe there will be a next time. :)   I ordered a whole bunch of things for my friends and I to share..... butter chicken special, dahl, cauliflower, etc. They even have lassi on the menu! The food arrived hot and packaged so neatly. As we unwrapped our food like the hunger ridden lazy bones we are, I realized that we didn't get the rice that was supposed to be included with the special combination sets.   So I call the restaurant and ask about my rice. The workers (owners, I think) who answered the phone were apologetic and wanted to make things right. I felt bad, but at the same time, I'm from Hawaii. I eat rice with every meal, every day! I needed my rice!!  The guy on the phone takes down my address and delivers it to me. This is all at 4am, mind you. I didn't have to step outside once.   Thank you, kind sir, for delivering rice to me. Insignificant as it may seem, I greatly appreciate your effort and dedication to running such an ethical business. Honestly, thank you. I know how cold it is out there.   Dine here! Or at least get Ubereats when you're too cold to walk outside and get food!"}
{"text":"This is relatively a new Indian place on St. Laurent. They have special lunch meals or special for the day which are resonalbly priced. However, if you end up ordering separately from the menu, it becomes an expensive place. In addition, the service needs a lot of improvement. One of their servers did not even know how to pronounce the names on the menu, and had no clue what was in the dish!! And they take forever to serve the food after the orders, even when there are not many people in the restaurant. On enquiring about the delay, the server said that there are lot of foodora orders!!!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favourite places to get Indian food in the city. I came across Mumbai Masala by chance a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier. The food is great, the portions are big, the prices are cheap, and they deliver!   I don't dine-in often, but the service tends to be good, and the food never disappoints. I do order for delivery, and my only complaint is that sometimes it can take 90 minutes or more. With that said, the food always hits the spot, so it's worth it. The menu is massive, and there are options for all types of eaters. I often modify existing items, and the restaurant is always accommodating. One of my favourite things about this establishment is that they're open until 2AM, which is perfect when you're out late.   I highly recommend Mumbai Masala if you're looking for cheap Indian food - you won't regret it!"}
