{"text":"Absolutely love the carnitas dinner - best pork you'll ever eat! The margaritas are very good, service is consistently good and staff is super nice. We are locals and this is one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Great food, Great price, Great service, all around Great.  I go to college in Berea so I don't always go out for a sit down meal, but whenever I do my friends and I always go to Maya's. They always start off with never ending fresh homemade chips and salsa. But be careful not to eat to many or you wont have room from your food! They give you a huge portion so you will likely take home some leftovers. You really get your money's worth here (Baldwin Wallace student get 10% off with ID). I always get El Combo which has a little bit of everything. If its your first time here definitely try that if you cant decide on what to get.  There not only dine in but pick up as well. Pick up usually a 15 min wait on food. If you're planning on dining in on a Friday or Saturday prepare for a wait. If there's a line and it's go to the store next door and wait.  Overall fabulous food! Great authentic Mexican restaurant in Northern Ohio!"}
{"text":"Maya is the best ,very friendly and helpful staff. We have been  there many times and are always happy.the chips and salsa come to the table quickly and once you order your delicious food it is on the table before you finish your first beer"}
{"text":"Great place. We go weekly. Great, fast service. Great place for kids too. Margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"I love coming here, the people are friendly, the food is good, and the atmosphere around you makes the experience that much better! The customer service is good, each server is well trained, and the salsa is delicious! It's not a true Mexican restaurant if they don't serve chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff. They always make me feel welcomed and offer exceptional service."}
{"text":"This place offers it all- reasonably priced GREAT food, with fast and friendly service. I especially love the tamales  and relaxing with a cold margarita in this fun lively atmosphere. Always look forward to the next visit!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here the other night.  To preface this review, both of us are native Texans that lived in Texas for more than twenty years.    We were initially excited to try this restaurant based on the rating, but we were extremely disappointed.  The chips and salsa were incredibly bland.  Seriously, I would have rather eaten Pace salsa from the store.  Then came the main course.  The chimichanga that I had was mediocre at best.  It looked like they used decent quality meat, but the flavor as a whole just wasn't there.  The tacos that my girlfriend had were awful.     The restaurant's only saving grace was that they did have good service.    All in all, I would have rather gone to Taco Bell.  I would have paid a fifth of the price for a better meal, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We love Maya!!!!    The entire staff at MetroPet Veterinary Clinic"}
{"text":"Fantastic food,great draft beer the taco salad and tortilla soup are amazing. Love coming here!!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious. I had the steak and shrimp fajitas, but they were kind of bland, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great place in Berea.  We go there for lunch at work a lot.  The food is great, the service is fast, and they have quick lunch specials to get you back to work on time."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great prices, Maya is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!! Great service and the margaritas are second to none!"}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican restaurant, it's not the worst either. Food was alright, service was good, but overall, meh"}
{"text":"always loved the place but the last few times the flies took over it was gross the first time i thought ok maybe a couple flies got in an they couldnt help it but the second time sent me over the edge plus it was fall/winter time no flies out  i was with my family an was swatting at flies with the menu we were being attacked waitress would come to see if were doing ok an seen me swatting at flies she would turn away we got up went to pay are bill i pulled manger to the side they all new me an my family because we were regulars there he said sorry we know its a problem an thats it no bill taken care of or anything i will never go back an thats a shame it use to be good"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick & inexpensive lunch (not to mention tasty), this is your place to be. If you're looking for the best after-work margaritas in town, this is your place to be. Quick, friendly service paired with yummy food. Go for the shrimp meals. They're reasonably priced and generous with the shrimp; unlike most other restaurants where you get maybe 3 or 4 small pieces of something that might pass for a shrimp."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. The service is always pleasant and fast. The food is typical American/Mexican style but the ingredients are always fresh and tasty. We have yet to have a dish that disappoints. If you are in the mood for Mexican and in the Berea area you can't go wrong with Maya. (Don't let a crowd deter you, they are often busy but turn over tables quickly.)"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and fast, friendly service.  Always a good time!  We have never been disappointed in the food or staff.  We highly recommend....great value!"}
{"text":"Place was busier than I thought it would be.  Staff was great and food was very yummy.  Even my 11 yr old who doesn't like Mexican food liked it.  Price is good and servings are huge.  Currently my favorite Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Hmmm...prices were way more than fair for the quantity of food served but nothing in my fajita dinner was out of the ordinary.  In fact, my chicken was dry and overdone although it still had a nice spicy seasoning coating the thin meat strips.  The beans were standard refried with a less than generous sprinkling of cheese on top and the guac was watery.   Our server was also less than enthused to be waiting on us and did not perk up until we got up to pay at the front (which no one explained to us so we sat there for quite some time before we figured out no one was coming to get our credit cards from the table). The redeeming factor for Maya's was my margarita was pretty good and priced right.  So if you are looking for standard issue mexican food and are not too fussy on preprartion techniques - this place will fit the bill."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with friends- margaritas were very good, not too sweet, and their guacamole was flavorful and fresh. Their service is prompt and friendly and prices are reasonable. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican food! Good attention, always fast, amazing flavor!! I loved his place, I'm coming back tonight."}
{"text":"Great meals and friendly service.  Our favorite spot for mexican.  Chory Pollo is the best!"}
{"text":"I had the El Cozumel Fajita.  It was bland.  I was expecting hot off the grill steak, chicken and shrimp on top of sizzling onions, mushrooms and peppers.  What I received was a plate of steaming ingredients.  They were obviously cooked in a pan, all together, so that the water from the vegetables basically boiled the meats.  Everything tasted the same and the steak was tough.  There were no spices that I could discern.   When a gave my opinion to the inquiring waiter, he apologized and offered for me to choose something else.   My wife's carnitas tasted pretty good so I played it safe and ordered that."}
{"text":"I recomend this resturant to everyone it is my favorite mexican resturant burritto de la roquetta is the best thing i ever ate"}
{"text":"WOW!  What a great find!!  Friendly service, great food served quickly at such reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Yet again, Maya comes thru. Got my parents turned onto it now. If you live in the Berea, Strongsville, Middleburg Hts area you absolutely have to eat here."}
{"text":"After discussing Mexican all week at work I just needed it. lol This place is delicious! The complementary chips and salsa was so yummy. I got the super burrito and I was not disappointed! The service was fast and friendly. They were playing live music which was very relaxing and my toddler just loved it."}
{"text":"Thought the food was above average. Nothing special for a Mexican spot. Service could be better but they were not awful"}
{"text":"Everything is so good here. From the warm yellow corn chips to the tasty salsa with just enough kick and taste. Get the queso (or as Clevelanders say...cheese dip) and mix in some of their salsa into it. Muy Bueno!! The meals have always been so good and the service is just as good. The tortillas are so good you can just eat them plain. They seem house made. I could be wrong. The decor is really nice and they have comfortable seating with nice amount of natural light. This place has become my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"As local Americanized-Mexican restaurants go, Maya is right up there.  Their chips and salsa are quite tasty, and of course the service is lightning fast and courteous.  I love their white cheese dip as an appetizer, often putting it on my main dish if any does not get gobbled up early on.  I've had combo meals and they have all been quite tasty with the requisite rice and beans on the side, but my favorite is a chicken taco salad that comes standard with both sour cream and homemade guacamole.  Prices are extremely reasonable, and there are always coupons floating around making the meal even more affordable.  Nice job, guys!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. They are some of the hardest workers in town! They are quick with the chips and salsa. I have to recommend the Mexican tacos. Not the usual tacos! Great margaritas and 4 of the 6 draft beers are Mexican beers."}
{"text":"The interior is a big step up from nearby Nuevo Acapulco. They serve the type of food you would expect, but the presentation and atmosphere is a tad nicer than other local options. It is close to Baldwin-Wallace College."}
{"text":"This restaurant is only a few minutes from where I grew up and i've been wanting to try it out for a long while. My parents and I finally went here to celebrate my sisters birthday last week and the food was delicious. We got a serving of their queso dip and wow, some of the best I've had!   We shared a half pitcher of their strawberry daiquiri and they did not skimp on the booze. It was both strong and tasty.  The service was both friendly and speedy. When my mother orders it can be quite an ordeal but the waitress was polite and accommodating as she asked question after question about numerous menu items.   There are a number of restaurants in this small college town but Maya is a can't miss."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. Food is always delicious and always ready super fast. They give you a lot of food for a good price. Chips and salsa are endless. And their margaritas always have lots of alcohol in them. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good service (as usual for a Mexican restaurant).  Salsa and chips were good---nice tomato-y salsa.  So points for that.  The bean burrito was AWESOME.  Cheese enchilada was okay.  Their beans have a more robust flavor than most Mex places, thus why I loved them.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"This is a cute place (particularly like the stained glass front windows), with cheap prices.  Service was excellent.  Food isn't great, but it's not bad either.  You'll find better tex-mex elsewhere in the country, but for Ohio it's pretty par for the course food-wise."}
{"text":"This is a very good Mexican restaurant. It was clean and the staff was friendly bas well as helpful. The food was excellent. My wife and ordered three dishes to try knowing full well we would be taken some home. When the Guadalajara special, rice bowl and shrimp quesadilla. The flan was excellent just as well as the churros which were served with a chocolate sauce and a caramel sauce if you have a sweet tooth this will satisfy you. The price was reasonable. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"We were told by a college student that a trip to Maya was a huge part of the experience in Berea. I will definitely go back to keep that going!  Just delicious! All four of us in my party agreed we want to eat at Maya again soon. I felt the rice and beans were especially good. It was easy to order my gluten and dairy free foods to accommodate my allergies. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"food is always good, service is fast and friendly. our regular go to local place. bright colorful decor. good sized returaunt, even when its busy you can get in with little to no waiting."}
{"text":"Came here for an after work drink and meal. Couldn't enjoy enjoy my meal or drink because of the FLIES surrounding my table and the area by the window. The waitress checked on me one time in 20 minutes. When I went to pay the check, after abandoning my food and drink, I told the lady ringing me out the issues and all she did was look at me. Horrible customer service. I won't be back. I miss the Mexican restaurant on front street from years ago. NEVER had an issue at that Mexican restaurant. The burrito was gross and the pork inside horribly bland, absolutely no seasoning. The beans were all mushed and was not good. Quality at Maya is apparently non existent. You have twenty workers milling about but can't get rid of flies?? Oh, OK. #disgusting"}
{"text":"I don't know why we even come here anymore, except that it's close.  We maybe come here once every couple of years, and every time, I ask myself the same question.  The salsa is not that great, the refried beans are way too salty, and the food is not that spicy.  The pitcher of margaritas might as well be called lime juice on the rocks........if there was any tequila in there, it must have walked through with its boots on.  Hopefully I will remember this in another couple of years when someone suggests going there, and not waste the money!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently made a list of our favorite restaurants, and under the category \"Mexican\", was one word: \"Maya\". Never have we been disappointed by the food, service, or prices. Authentic and addicting, this jalapeño hotspot serves up enchiladas, chimichongas, burritos, and a fantastic \"fajitas for two\" dish that could easily be named \"delicious, sizzling fajitas for 3, or possibly even 4, depending on how hungry you are\". Everyone working there is very friendly, and you can tell they take pride in their craft. They even circulate coupons--as if we need any more reason to give them our money.  Bottom line: If you've been to Maya, congratulations on having won at life. If not, you owe it to yourself. Go!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the service is excellent and the food is always delicious.  I have been here about 10 or 11 times, I have never had a bad meal and the service is freakishly fast.  You order your food and the next thing you know its at your table.  They also have good drink deals, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Maya is my favorite place to get Mexican food! Cheap and great food- how can you go wrong?  The meals are cheap so it works perfect for people (eh, college students) who are tight on cash! You really get your money's worth here!  It's a fast paced environment! Seated fast, order fast, and food to you....fast! it's a great time!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant.  We have been  going  there since they first opened quite a few years ago.   No matter what we order,  we are never disappointed and the excellent quality never changes  They have many combination plates, fajitas,  salads,  soups as well as a Kid's Menu which has Mexican as well as American.   Parking is never a problem since they are located in a super large parking lot which many years ago housed a grocery store.   If someone in your group is celebrating a birthday,  be sure to tell the hostess or server when you arrive.    I know you will never be disappointed with the size and quality of everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food around PERIOD. Food is always fresh , hot and delicious! Would not recommend another Mexican place. You can't beat the prices and top food quality. Seriously best Mexican food. And service is fast. And they get to know you personally which is since. Their sour cream is the best in the worlds as is their cheese dip! Give them and try you'lol thank me later. And if you don't have time to sit in, their take out is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Best chimichanga since I left Texas in 1997.  Salsa for the chips is awesome and wife loves her fajita. A little bit of a drive but we will be back. Staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"First time being here- excellent service, staff and food. Very busy Sunday evening around 6.30-7pm so a good sign. Very friendly cashier lady I must say! Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  fast, friendly service, and the food is great!  The chile relleno is the only one in the area that i smade this way- with ground beef, PERFECT! (that I have found!)  I highly recommend this place!  been going there for years, only gets better!  Buen Provecho!"}
{"text":"Not often in Berea for much of anything, but made a trip out to finally check out Campus Grille. Turns out they were closed so quickly yelped for a new joint...and Maya it was.   The scoop:  Service was on point. All were Mexican and it was nice to exercise my native tongue. This is the definition of tex-mex food. Huge portions and a joy to look at. Flavors are there. Sad not to see a mole on the menu or actual queso fresco atop my enchiladas, but how many people outside Mexico/SoCal understand how important queso fresco is to enchiladas!?  Margaritas were cheap and sweet. Go jumbo. They got oomph.   All in all, the lady was extremely happy which made me happy. That's a win."}
{"text":"When I first moved back from CHI to CLE I was on the hunt for some good Mexican food (note, I still haven't found it).  I went to Maya back then (7 long years ago now) and had a HORRIBLE experience and vowed not to return.   As you can see from my check-ins....I returned.   Things have Changed, I think they've done some decorative updates which are nice.  The bar is nice and they make a good Marg.  I've had good service the few times I've been back and I plan on returning.  Last visit, I enjoyed 2 large Margs and some Fajita Nachos.  They were huge (enough for two) and delicious!  Portions are typical Mexican-restaurant size portions (plenty for multiple meals) and if you're not expecting \"real\" Mexican food (which I'm not sure I'd even recognize anymore), you'll be happy.  Stop on by and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Salsa is mediocre, but some might like crap salsa. The queso and cheese dip is watered down. If you order it to go you won't get much chips. I'm from the south where you can find some of the better Mexican food. This is spam quality food on a silver plate. They gave us a taco salad with barely any lettuce. It looks like mush. The tacos were edible and decent. Take my advice and go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. When I worked down the street, we went here for lunch every couple weeks. This was my first time having dinner and a margarita. The staff is always friendly and their service is prompt. They have wonderful lunch specials and daily specials. They have a great assortment of flavored margaritas including my favorite, mango. I had chicken chimichangas last night and my friend had the fajita quesadilla. Chips and salsa are brought to the table to start off your meal and they'll bring you more as you get down to the bottom. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Carlos and his team are top notch.  This was a pleasant surprise to find some good Mexi food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Cleveland hands-down! Fast friendly service. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Come here every time we're in town. Love their steak fajitas!!! Fast service and employees are always on point"}
{"text":"Maya is a point of pride in my city. People know about this place for miles away. I guess it's because the quality is reflected in their work. They have good drink specials, excellent service, and as good of Mexican food as you can get. I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed once. If you get Carlos consider yourself lucky."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and this was our first visit to Maya. The food was delicious and the margaritas packed a punch! The service was really good too. I would definitely come back next time we visit Ohio."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and beverages! This place is always hopping! The service is always good and the food is served very fast and hot. A+"}
{"text":"Timed the table service one time and they brought us our food 4 minutes and 44 seconds after ordering. The food is pretty baller status. All the servers are gods. I go here on the reg."}
{"text":"I love Maya. I always get a jumbo margarita or split a pitcher and shredded chicken nachos. I could drink the queso, I always get extra. The margaritas are pretty strong, but smooth. If your looking for a deal they have margarita specials on Tuesdays. I've tried some of the combination dinners, tacos, and other items and never been disappointed. Usually the nachos fill me up though, as it's a large portion. I really like the fajitas too! That portion is HUGE. Even with two of us sharing it we had half left. The staff is always friendly and easy to chat with. They get pretty busy, but I've never had to wait long for a table or I've been able to just grab a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in berea. It was busy on a Saturday evening. Wait time was 15 min but were seated in 5 min. Server served our drinks in no time. Margaritas are worth the money especially  if one orders a pitcher. Service was prompt. Ambience was ok nothing great. I ordered the pollo con queso and it was served siZzling hot. Cacun cheese steak with chicken option was good. Vegetarian combo no. 2 was delicious. Overall worth the price. Looked at the happy hr and daily lunch specials and looked very reasonable. Worth another try."}
{"text":"I live nearby and eat here quite often. Just love this place whether for dining in or carry out. Great prices, nice atmosphere, good portions, friendly staff. And the chips! What makes them so darn good I do not know but they're always warm and the salsa is the best I've ever had. Everyone in the area eat here, it can get crowded but the wait is never long. Good job, Maya!"}
{"text":"We went back to Maya, and wow what a difference, love the food and the quickness."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to restaurant when our daughter was attending BW and before we started going to Fuji Grill in Parma.  Tried it again on Saturday afternoon.  Food was good, my wife had the Pollo Loco and I had the lunch Chicken Chimichanga.  The wait staff seemed to all be new, service was OK but nothing special like it used to be.  Unfortunately Saturday afternoon seems to be the preferred time for moms and grandmothers to bring their kids and let them run around."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now. Every time has been a ton of food for a small amount of money. The drinks are cheap and the margaritas are great! The atmosphere is fun and I have had great service. Tonight was so fast that I didn't even have time to finish the story I was telling! I have also been there for private catered events and they did a good job handling us! I would really recommend this place, I only dropped 20 dollars and paid for 2 meals, a side, and drinks. Good deal!"}
{"text":"Every time we walk into Maya we are greeted with a high five & smile from Carlos. I love that the servers already know what we want and how we want our food prepared. Best Salsa this side of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here often almost every since they open in Berea.  The food has alway been flavorfull, the margaritas the best anywhere!"}
{"text":"Reviews like this are always tricky because they involve trusting the immaturity of my college aged taste buds. And let's be real here, I lived off of Panini 's sandwiches and late night stops at Taco Bell. Not really trustworthy, wouldn't you say?  But from all I can remember, this was the tastiest Mexican comfort food I had ever had. Delicious, fresh tasty chips that were perfectly done and devine spicy salsa. Yes, I've purchased it to-go even. Admittedly I didn't explore the menu to the fullest extent.  Cheese enchiladas with rice and beans were damn delicious though. And food comes out faster than you can slap your knee. I have no idea what that means."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Mexican food for reasonable prices, and attentive service Maya is a great pick! The staff clearly wants return customers."}
{"text":"ugh, jesus christ.  was literally crawling on my basement floor after eating here and didn't even consume meat.  never again"}
{"text":"Ehhh... Lots of food but everything tasted the same and bland...My Mexican should be  spicy and varied in flavour... Not so much here...It wasn't bad, just not great...I'd say just ok..."}
{"text":"Excellent casual Mexican food.  This is our destination of choice when we head over to the west side to visit with family.  The food is very good, the service is friendly, and has been mentioned elsewhere, the food comes out pretty quickly.  Worth driving 15-20 minutes out of the way if you're looking for good Mexican food on the southwest side of town."}
{"text":"Nothing special here at Maya. It's your standard Americanized TexMex Restaurant complete with fajitas and burritos/enchiladas smothered in cheese. It's ok, but it's nothing to write home about.   I checked in with my girlfriend and we were seated immediately with complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were either stale or cooked in too much oil. I couldn't determine which, but they weren't that tasty. The salsa was watery and didn't have much flavor. I suppose that worked in my favor, because I definitely was not tempted in any way to indulge in chips and salsa, thereby ruining my appetite for the actual meal which is often the case.   I ordered the Burrito A La Diambla, a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken and chorizo in what was supposed to be a spicey hot sauce and topped off with, of course, melted cheese. The meal came with rice and beans; not refried beans though, more like pork and beans. The burrito was good, but not spicy in any way as indicated in the menu's description. The rice was better than most and the beans were different than what I expected, but good enough. I ate half of the burrito, half of the rice and most of the beans. It's a lot of food.   The service was prompt and friendly, and the restaurant was clean. They also have a small bar in the back right corner that can maybe seat 10 patrons.   All in all, Maya was \"fine.\" I'd go again. It's just nothing that will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Great good and customer service, best Mexican restaurant in Berea, gets crowded on the weekend evenings"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Decor! and GREAT Margarita!   I've only been once, so I can't comment on everything on the menu (give me a few weeks) but the Chimmichanga was very good.. not as crispy as I like but still good..  The Salsa is a bit soupy  rather than chuky salsa, which is great for me!  Guacamole was delicious and only 2 bucks!   Drinks are very well priced and strong."}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner yesterday, food tasted old, my daughter and I ordered super burritos, very bland, over cooked ground beef, cold rice, dry dry dry chicken, which tasted like it was originally made for another dish, much earlier in the day.  My son had the California burrito and the meat \"steak\" was mushy, it was not edible.  Iced tea even tasted old!  The only good food was the salsa.  Definitely not worth the price we paid! Would not go back."}
{"text":"Gotta downgrade my original love of Maya. Prices  and quality and service . Waited for several more visits to make sure it wasn't a bad day and it's true."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing. The food is amazing,  the servers are great. ,  I orderd the Vallarta special an ohh my god Soo freaking good. , the server suggested am it was a great choice. I highly recommend coming here! If u like Mexican food  then try it it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Good, clean establishment. They are always busy. Went on a Thursday night where there were no specials and there was a waiting list for dinner. Had the \"California Burrito\" and it perfect with steak tips. I came here out of word-of-mouth because this place has a great reputation in the area. I would come back and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years because I think it's the best place for Mexican in the Berea/Middleburg Heights/Parma Heights area.   I've dined in & mostly gotten take out...it's always good. I never had a bad meal here. The servers are very friendly & attentive. You can expect to get your food fast despite it being packed.  My favorite thing to order is the Mexican Tacos. It's a steak & sausage filled in a corn tortilla. It comes with cilantro & salsa verde (I believe). I also like to add sour cream & a little bit of salt & pepper to really amp up the flavor of the tacos. I also enjoy the enchiladas & nachos. Lastly, the chips & salsa is amazing!  If you're in the area & you're craving Mexican, definitely check out Maya's."}
{"text":"This is getting to be a once a week place. Comfort food. Fast & Friendly service."}
{"text":"The best of the Americanized Mexican restaurants.    We went for the first time tonight.  Fabulous service.   Great hostess - she had a table setup and was wonderful with the three children at our table.   The food was very good.  I had Chile Rojo.   The steak was decent, the sauce had a wonderful earthy chili pepper flavor.  It was just what I was after.   My wife had the Chimiganga and Chile Rellano.    Her food was OK - decent quality, tasted good, but not the best we've ever had.  Margaritas were very good.    We'll be back as the overall experience was the best for this kind of restaurant.  I'm glad our friends suggested it."}
{"text":"Was in town and craving Mexican food.  Thanks fellow yelpers - this place was great, service was great - just wish I lived closer.  I would be a regular.  Make sure and treat yourself to a Margarita - they were super delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants around my area. The staff is always extremely friendly! My mom always tells the girls she is going to take the cook home! I cannot review the meat dishes at this place because I always get the same vegetarian meal every time. We also always get their guacamole and queso dip too, which is so good! Everytime I have been here the food is always hot, same great taste and the servers are always awesome!"}
{"text":"Maya is our favorite Mexican restaurant. The staff is always very fast and friendly. Try the steak fajita quesadilla, you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"We have always liked this place but the new menu is great! Taquitos quesdillios tacos ! Yum!  Excellent!  Worth the drive from the east side!"}
{"text":"Okay. I just ordered and want to draft this review before my food arrives.  My first impression of Maya... Oh, nevermind. My foods here.   Yeah, it was that fast. Most Mexican and Chinese restaurants are. I'm not stereotyping if it's totally true, right?  But Mayas food came out twice as fast as other Mexican restaurants. It's as if other Mexican restaurants take your order then order it from Maya. I dunno.  Everything else was typical for a Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area. Decent salsa and chips. Etc. Etc.  We'll return if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time for lunch.  It's in a plaza, so there is plenty of parking  We were sat right away.  The place is clean It's nice cause they have huge booths that could sit a larger group of at least 8 I'd say.     Free salsa & chips that r good We also got the cheese and a guacamole. Both very good  Lime margarita on the rocks = very good!not a gross tasting mix  Server very nice  Playing Mexican music  Got the chicken fajita quesadilla and my partner in crime got the chimichanga - both very good   I'm not usually a fan of Mexican food, but I will definitely be back here!!"}
{"text":"Good local Mexican place. Food is very tasty and it is not like your normal Mexican neighborhood place, this one goes an extra mile!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. I LOVE maya! I can never get enough! If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be maya. Their rice is to die for! So so good. Don't walk, RUN there. Amazing!"}
{"text":"5th best Fajitas I've ever had, Mexican coke and killer chips and salsa. We have a winner!"}
{"text":"Complimentary chip & salsa!!!  Very nice!! Food is simple, fresh and fast!   Cheaper than Chipotle  or Taco Bell.   Must try!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and fast service. Dinner for two with desert and a beer only 27. Will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Maya is our go to Mexican restaurant.  Always great food.  We usually fill up on the chips and take part of our meal Home.  But that's how you can tell it's good.  It tastes just as good the next day cold!  The kids always want to eat at Maya.  And so do I!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for a pitcher of Margaritas and some great Mexican food. They have outstanding Queso Fundido with Chorizo and their Camarones Con Crema is to die for. It's a rich, creamy shrimp dish, and the portion size is huge. I always end up taking half of it home. You can't go wrong if you order this dish. It's price is a little higher than the other dishes but it is well worth it. They have great specials like Monday Beef Tacos for .99 and $1.00 off bottles of beer. The food is good and there are plenty of servers to take care of you. All in all it is a great place to get great Mexican food and drinks."}
{"text":"Living in Berea for almost three years now, I can honestly say that Maya is my absolute favorite restaurant to go to. I have been there roughly 50-60 times, and have never been disappointed. The staff are friendly, the food is awesome. And make sure to get a Margarita, Strawberry Mango is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yum, frickin yum.  Every time we go, and we go a lot, the food is excellent, the service is great and the salsa is amazing.  My hubby even bought me some for Christmas one year."}
{"text":"Because I'm transplanted here from San Diego, Mexican food is always part of my weekly, if not daily, menu plan.  For the most part I've been able to make due with nuking something from Trader Joe's frozen food case, but when I want REAL Mexican food and a margarita, Maya's is where I head to.  And on the weekend so does everyone else.  The place is always packed!  When I visit Maya's I feel like I'm back in San Diego, seated at the landmark, Old Town Mexican Cafe.  People, this is the real deal.  Maya's serves authentic Mexican food.  Is it gourmet Mexican food?  No, but then I'm not someone who wants a $25 plate of chicken mole, either.  Maya's satisfies my craving.  They offer pork carnitas which are every bit as good as those served in San Diego.  ditto the chips, salsa, guacamole...... and margaritas.  If, like me, you prefer shredded beef rather than the 'Americanized' ground beef, Maya's has it, so ask!  If you haven't experienced shredded beef, give it a try in whatever you'd normally have ground beef.   The taco salads here are wonderful and so tasty, especially when I cover it with their homemade salsa.  OMG!  I'm in heaven!  The chicken is all white meat, and so much of it that I've often joked that it's not even a salad because there's more meat than greens.  LOL  The salad & chips are enough to have me waddling out of here wishing I had stopped eating when I was full half a salad ago. It just tastes so good I can't stop eating until I feel sick.  ha ha ha  Fast service, free refills on fountain drinks, never ending chips and salsa.  Maya's makes may homesickness for San Diego much easier to deal with."}
{"text":"Crazy Good !! The have real \"taco stand\" tacos.  If you know what I mean, order the \"Mexican Tacos\" -- not the standard tacos.  You'll be blown away.  Oh, ask for a lime wedge because it doesn't come with lime -- it's no extra charge. Tamales are magnifico. All the Mex standards are great, too. Fast, clean, fun.  Waiters have small language barriers, but that adds to the charm. Can't stop thinking about the Mexican Tacos."}
{"text":"Ambiance is pleasant, service is super quick even when packed, and the food is great. We still talk about our dinner there as we had to roll out we were so pleasantly stuffed!   Definitely get the fried ice cream it is slamming!"}
{"text":"Great place. Clean, comfortable, good service, fresh chips, ok salsa (not hot enough for me), good vegetarian selection, good price.  We came at Saturday about 4, it quickly got very crowded with families. Will return!"}
{"text":"MAN I love good service!   I came to Maya with a group of at least 20 college-aged and 20-30-something young adults who were just coming off the high of a week of camp with small children and who needed to relax and let loose. This group was loud, obnoxious and could've easily ticked off any staff at a restaurant. However, the Maya staff were phenomenal. They were patient, took our orders, got them right, took our drinks, got them right, even divided up separate checks and GOT IT RIGHT. I mean WAY. TO. GO. They were happy we chose to eat with them and it showed.   The food was delicious. The chips and salsa were neverending. And all in all it was a great night. Great job, Maya."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the girls! Can't believe I've never been to this Mecca of comfort Mexican food. This is your typical Mexican joint, big portions really quick. Seriously, we ordered and within 5 minutes we had our meals!  I split the fajitas grande (fajitas for two) and it was way more then enough to split. We even took a ton home. The meat in the fajita was really Good, it came with shrimp, beef, chicken, and chorizo. I liked the variety, would totally get it again. Everyone else liked their meals too! Bottom line: cheapy Mexican and flowing margs, check it out!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Mexican restaurant ever. Cold underwhelming food, small portions for high prices, no toilet paper in the bathroom, rude waiter, loud rude customers around us with uncontrolled kids. We drove up for the cinco de mayo festival but since the rain was so bad we decided to just go to a restaurant. Big mistake. I can't believe this place has such great reviews. This was awful. I wouldn't let my worst enemy eat here."}
{"text":"I'm surprise with the fast and friendly service of Maya's staff. Margaritas are fantastic with different choices to pick. You get some nice chips and salsa for free as an appetizer here.  I ordered the super burrito and it was pretty good. The price was reasonable as well,  most of Maya's menu will cost you less then 12 bucks. shredded chicken in my burrito as well as the meat was kind of dry and really wasn't the best kind of meat or chicken. My entire dish was filled with the burrito, lettuce and other condiments which was nice. The choices of beer is limited but I guess that is expected from a small business. Overall good restaurant for a good price, although the meat and chicken could of been better"}
{"text":"We stopped in to Maya's on a road trip going off of other Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was nice. We were greeted immediately and seated in a large booth. Our server was very friendly and took our order pretty quickly. I had the chicken enchiladas. They were not the best I've ever had nor the worst. Better than fast food Mexican for sure. Husband got the Chile Rojo. He said it was good, but the sauce was a little too \"tomatoey\" for his taste and he would have liked more spice. Over all it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"I'd give them a better rating but they offer no substitutions. As a vegetarian sometimes it is helpful just to make a few substitutions. My waiter wouldn't have it. Then he said maybe, I asked for a cheese quesadilla instead of an enchilada and he said no. Hmmm. Food is okay and lunch prices are cheap."}
{"text":"Great food! Good atmosphere! Service is seriously lacking. We had empty waters and salsa almost the entire meal. We then waited a good 20 minutes for our check. The waiter was unapologetic and then proceeded to take the next tables order after I explained we were trying to leave asap. Again everything but the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Also very accommodating for picky eaters who make many substitutions like myself :) would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went with a group. Fast service. Very flexible with substitutions and able to order off lunch menu at dinner time. All portions were very generous. I ordered pollo con crema and loved the spicy jalapeños. Able to take almost half home. Drinks were delicious. Tried margaritas and draft beer. Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Last week while on a business trip I stopped here for dinner after looking at Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. During ordering I asked if I could substitute out the refried beans for charra bean and was told they only served refried beans so that's what I ordered. I usually don't like refried beans because they usually don't taste good and they are bad for,you.  About 10 minutes later my food arrived and I took a pic of it. Looked really good with a lot of shrimp and veggies. I ate the meal and was very satisfied. I decided to try the refried beans and wound eating all of them. They were some of the best I have ever had. Excellent beans. My service was good and I liked the decor of the restaurant. My only annoyance was a very loud table of 6 that were near me that had drank too much wine and beer. Oh well...  I believe this is a very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food. Super-quick and friendly service. I had the El Cancun Fajitas and couldn't finish 1/2 my plate."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Mexican restaurant. There's just no way to beat the quality of taste, price and speed at which the food comes out, and to top it all off the staff is authentic. The decor also reminds me of the type I'd see in Tarandacuao. Maya is definitely a top-notch restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is a great tex-mex place. The food is good and the margaritas are tasty. The only thing missing from there menu is a happy hour."}
{"text":"Make sure you get the Cozumel Soup. Even if you aren't a soup person...get the soup. It's so good, it warms the soul, hits all the right taste buds and is just down right delicious in its simplicity. During the most recent visit we also really enjoyed the queso, tamales, stuffed peppers, and the quesadilla. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Is the food good? Yeah, sure. It's great, but it's pretty much what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant such as this. But there are several other places in the area where we could get the same meal. But the staff is what brings us back again and again. These people are friendly. We're there fairly frequently and the waitresses are chatty and excited to see our children. The staff acts as though their genuinely exited to see us there. And perhaps they are!   Just a note, the place does fill up quite a bit at normal peak times and there could be a bit of a wait.   And yeah, great margaritas."}
{"text":"This it their shot!  One ounce!  Half full . Lol.  Rip off.  Don't go there...seriously one ounce... at 4.20/ shot!!! Lol OMG!  It's almost funny to get a thimble of liquor.  Maybe we should build a wall if they're here ripping us off like this .  Look at the picture I included!!! So funny.  I even asked, they said it was in that little cup because they were out of shot glasses.!  The waitress went in to explain that the shot glass was the same as what she was serving ... because the glass was so thick on the bottom .  There's no denying that the bottom of the plastic shot glass says \"1oz\".  HOLLY SHIT!  They're making 200/ bottle ... lol Mexicans"}
{"text":"I visited here this evening with my 2 kids.  I wish there was a half star rating system here.  This place would be the perfect 3.5.  Not really a 4.  Not really a 3.  3.5 would be just right.  We were quickly greeted.  Seated promptly.  Order was taken right away and food came out less than 5 minutes later.  I read this in other reviews so this was exactly what I was looking for.  Reasonable (adult meals mostly under $10; kid meals under $5) and quick in and out service.  I got exactly what I expected here.  Decor is starting to wear here.  I don't take away points for that unless its really dirty.   I didn't think that about this place.  The food itself arrived hot.  Free chips and salsa.  Salsa was as good as it gets anyplace.  Loaded with onion and cilantro.  My kinda of salsa.  With a touch of heat.  I really like that.  Portions are on par with other Mexican places in t he area.  And the food overall is just average.  I'd say 3.5 for the food.  Not bad.  Not blow me away thinking this was very flavorful and different.  Just average.  Average taco, chile poblano, and enchilada.  All what I expected.  So I'm not going to penalize the restaurant for the rating system here.  So that's why the 4 stars.  If that changes I can revisit this review someday."}
{"text":"I've traveled a lot in the Southwest. This is a very good Mexican restaurant. I ordered the Camarines al Modo del Ajo. Garlic shrimp. Shrimp is properly cooked. Garlic sauce is good. Comes with salad with pick de gallo. I actually liked the pico. Doesn't happen often. Comes with avocado slices that are fresh and generous. Margarita is good."}
