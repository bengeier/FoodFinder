{"text":"My mother and I stayed at this hotel for her Birthday and to have a quick mother daughter getaway from all the everyday obligations and responsibilities to just relax. The price for this hotel is reasonably cheaper in comparison to other hotels. However, it may not be as \"luxurious\" but still serves and provides its purpose. Pior to booking we weren't sure what the room included so we called just to double check and requested for an extra sofa bed. They quickly noted it down and obliged to our request, they also offered if I'd like an actual extra bed. (Take the extra bed). The sofa bed was alright to sleep on but became uncomfortable. (This was my mistake because what do you really expect from a sofa bed but to spare anyone else some trouble or back aches request for an extra bed instead). The hotel was very clean and the staff was hospitable, helpful and friendly. Although, if you are in need for actual plates and cutlery in the hotel room they do not provide these. (Me and my mom bought take out for dinner and brought it to the hotel to eat later so we didnt have to go back out). At most they will only provide glasses or wine glasses. Otherwise you might need to bring your own paper plates and cutlery if you don't want to be drinking out of paper cups and heating food up in a plastic takeout container. There is also a variety of places to eat out in the area. Breakfast at the hotel was substantial but if you want the extra hot sausage or bacon, eggs and home fries it will be an extra $5 which is also fair. If not, they have basic continental breakfast for free. The best part of the hotel room was the Jacuzzi bath. That was the star of the show. Provides in room private, peace and relaxation. (You're not suppose to light candles around the bath but I did. YOU CAN GET CHARGED FOR ANY SMELL OR DAMAGES IF CAUGHT. Buuut I didnt, just make sure theres no smoke and you dont leave the candles unattended) If you're looking for a quick cheap get away that provides the necessities I reccomend this hotel. I will be coming back for my birthday."}
{"text":"Like the other reviews, Monte Carlo's layout is a bit awkward.  I was aware of this prior, so while my parents parked and unloaded, I walked from the back parking lot and to the desk in the \"front\". By far the cleanest hotel out of all the value hotels I've stayed during this roadtrip. However, we couldn't get over the odor in the hallway of the fifth floor. Smelled like a sweaty locker room which lingered into our room. Did somebody work out downstairs and decide to stop drop 'n roll  all the way back? There was a car parked in the lot which kept blaring its alarm throughout the night. I didn't try their complimentary continental breakfast but according to my father, he said it was the least expansive out of the places we've stayed out. Apparently hot items like eggs and bacon were not included and were extra charge.   We needed a place to rest our weary heads before heading back on the road. Besides the egregious car alarm that was out of their hands, it was the sweat smell that I just couldn't get over, thus gets knocked down a star."}
{"text":"Weird setup with the parking in the back and the front desk at the front... so you have to walk through the whole building to get there. Pool at the side of the front desk. Continental breakfast included (note from teacher needed to get breakfast). $5 upsell to full breakfast. Decent room, good decor, loud heating/ac unit."}
{"text":"Would have gone lower if I could, manager was unbelievably rude, one of my co-workers ended up with bed bugs and when it was brought at the front desk, the manager glared at us. Also were told that we all demagnetized our room keys by having them near our phones.... Rooms were sub par at best and smelled like smoke. Edit to response - regardless of how bed bugs are dealt with. And yes they are not the fault of the hotel but the person who brought them in. The response from your desk staff was very inappropriate. There is no reason to be rude to your customers. Rule one of customer service is to be professional. If you have a group of frustrated people the last thing you do as a representative of a company is to give attitude, blame the customer and glare at them. And I find it odd that all of the group that I was with had their card demagnetized on the same day when none of us had that issue in any other prior day as we have been in hotels for the last 2 weeks. You may state your rooms are smoke free but of a group of 31 people 20 of us stated our rooms smelled of smoke."}
{"text":"You actually enter from the rear, as that is where all the parking is and have to come around the front, which is a bit awkward but front desk is easy to find.  Has automatic doors and both front and rear allowing for easy entry with luggage.  Landscaping is beautiful, both front and back with two large water fountain displays.  Safe, mini-fridge, microwave, lots of drawer space, desk to work @ with plugs up top and not underneath.  Two chairs for a sitting area with table so you do not have to watch TV in bed.  Lots of cupboard space.    Check in was a breeze, I just gave them my last name and they pulled up my reservation.  They did ask if we wanted a room with a Jacuzzi, but for $40 more to me that is not really worth it.  In hindsight it might have been since they do not have a hot tub, indoor or outdoor, just a pool.  The hotel does have a coin operated washer and dryer located on the bottom floor next to the fitness room.  This is also where a lot of the conference rooms are located.  Fitness room is a decent size, although the universal weight machine was out of order.  I did not see any free weights, but they do have a universal cable machine.  There are a couple treadmills, elliptical machines, and bikes if I recall.  My complaints are, no soap dish in the bathroom which makes cleaning harder and creates bacteria.  Water pressure could be a little better from the shower heads and it is somewhat dark while showering, so they could use a light fixture there.  Personal preference thing, but I did not like the carpeting, but it does go with the decor of the rest of the room.  All of these are minor though, and did not detract from our stay."}
{"text":"Seems like a very nice hotel. I went there for a meeting and only saw conference room and its very nice... Hotel looks very clean and staff are friendly..,"}
{"text":"I'm attending a user group meeting at this spacious venue this evening.  We're usually here at least twice per year.  Dinner was buffet style; very tasty meal and staff was very attentive.  Restrooms were clean and well maintained.  Lots of parking and close to Highways 401 and 407."}
{"text":"It's not bad as hotels go   I have found cheaper nicer hotels in Toronto however this is the location I required to be in for this stay.  Rooms are clean and well maintained  The reception team are friendly   Lost stars in the following  Poor layout for parking then having reception at the other side of parking entrance   Small bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) not enough for more than one person for one shower  The breakfast....... They make a big deal about the free breakfast ..... It's continental unless you pay more for a cooked breakfast  Even then there really isn't much choice ..... I'd go as far to say that it's the worse selection in any hotel I've been in. In top of the poor selection they had no black tea ..... Being a Brit ...... They would be beheaded for this in the old days!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience at the Monte Carlo!  Sure, the name is a little cheesy and makes you think of crooners from the 70s in crushed velvet suits, but it's actually a nice, modern, clean hotel.  As mentioned in previous posts, the layout is a little odd, but it just means you need to walk an extra 15 feet.  Suck it up buttercup!  We got a king bed in a basic room on the 4th floor.  Everything was fine.  It was quiet, clean, the bed was very comfortable, we got lots of TV channels and the tub was nice and deep.  There's a small pool, small gym, and free continental breakfast.   I'd say the breakky was probably the low point of the stay: there was no peanut butter for the toast, only jam and marmalade.  The hot oatmeal was terrible - it tasted old and musty.  The mini-croissants were stale and hard.  You can upgrade your breakfast for $5, which is probably the way to go if you want eggs etc.     If you're traveling in and out of Markham via the 407, the location is amazing.  If you're getting around via the 404, you might have to do a little backtracking, but it's not too bad.    Overall though, this was a good stay."}
{"text":"Everything was completely sufficient...room was small but clean, pool was small but big enough for the kids to enjoy themselves. Breakfast was all we needed without paying extra for hot food, and the food was very nicely presented, which made it better than many other continental breakfasts we've come across. What bumped up the stars was the cost, which was super affordable and the service. Every employee we came in contact with was helpful, polite and pleasant! Especially the man working in the breakfast room each morning who was super friendly to my kids and worked very fast and efficiently keeping the breakfast room clean and inviting!"}
{"text":"New hotel. The Riviera room is spacious, with a 3-person couch, 2 LCD TVs, a gas fireplace, and a Jacuzzi, along with the normal amenities such as safe, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, iron and iron board, and hair dryer.  Free parking, continental breakfast and Wifi (no password needed).    There is nothing luxurious in the room, but things are there, functional and tasteful.  I know they are nice now because they are *new*, but I am rating the hotel room now when it is new.  Room rate is reasonable for this really big room.   We did dine at the Menaggio Ristorante Grill and Wine Bar inside of the inn.  It is okay but a bit overpriced.  Please see my separate review of the restaurant under its separate listing.  Like it and don't mind placing visiting friends in this hotel.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"BOOK ONLINE. Unless you 'd rather fork over anywhere from $50-100 more, book via phone.   Cons  - Service: I called once to inquire about pricing on the rooms. The second time I called today (as I hoped to book), they decided to up-charge me and raise the price by $40. I tried to call through the Monte Carlo Inn main line to book a room and it was raised by another $30 in addition to the $40. Seriously? Just save yourself the headache and book online. When I went online, I was able to book the room at the original price I was quoted at."}
{"text":"Had my wedding reception in this hotel and the staff did a superb job.  The room for the night was included in the package and we upgraded for the Juliet suite where the bed was on the mezzanine floor and jacuzzi and living area was on the first floor. Also booked the night before to get everything ready for the wedding and the staff gave us a discount as well.  The food for the reception was excellent and service for the staff was top notch.  Would definitely recommend this place and rental of hall.  It is small but fit my wedding size of 110 comfortably with dance floor."}
{"text":"Came here for a workshop, so can not say anything about overnight stay here. The conference room was well lit and temperature fine. If we needed anything, there was always staff on hand to help out. The food they offered was also delicious.  I might decide to go there one night to see how the rooms are."}
{"text":"I can only review the conference center in the basement but the staff and main floor ambiance were very nice.   As for the conference room, it is next to the gym which makes it smell like sweat a little bit. The room itself is nice with a very good projector and free water and notepads. They offered cookies and coffee as well. Not sure if that comes standard."}
{"text":"Our pad for 3 nights during a visit to Markham recently.  A relatively new hotel addition in the area.  Convenient to most major travel arteries, and less than 30 minutes drive into Toronto depending on traffic.  Upon driving in, the signs actually direct you to the back of the hotel where the free parking lot is.  Through that back entrance, you can walk to the lobby/check-in desk area up front.  Although there's a front door by the lobby, we never used it and never prioritized figuring out if one could drive up that entrance.  Staff were efficient and courteous.  Our rooms were spacious and clean.  Pleasant enough decor, if somewhat generic and unremarkable.  In this area, there won't be much of a view.  LCD television, lots of drawer and closet space, big mirror by the door.  Beds were comfortable enough but nothing special.  Free wi-fi that we used regularly, a typical amenity for hotels in this area.  They have a restaurant downstairs that we didn't try.  Also a small, 24-hour fitness room that a member of the group did make use of.  Their pool is oddly located right by the lobby.  All in all, a good stay in a solidly average hotel, at average pricing for the area."}
{"text":"What a deal - for $129 we got a room with two double beds, free wifi, free parking, use of the saltwater pool, a continental breakfast, a discount voucher for the in-house resto, use of the 24 hour gym, and two adult tickets to the zoo! Beat that! You can also get discounted child tickets from them. Plus, the tickets allow you to beat the line at the zoo.  The rooms include a fridge, a safe (albeit inconveniently located), a flat-screen television, a microwave and a coffee maker plus sufficient bedding for the permanently cold (why don't all hotels provide duvets?). The toiletries were fine, nothing special. You can put your own food and drinks in the fridge. Our friends upgraded to the suite for $30/night.  Fantastic front-desk service. Nabil could not have been more welcoming or more polite. Such a nice introduction to the hotel. I needed a device charger - no problem (thanks, Jane!). We asked to get a room near to our traveling companions - no problem. Asked for a dinner recommendation - no problem."}
