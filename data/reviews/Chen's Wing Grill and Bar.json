{"text":"Okay. I know what you're thinking - five stars? But trust.  After a spooky Halloween event in downtown, my friends and I were hungry after driving back uptown. We looked on Yelp for a late night place and Chen's (not to be confused with the restaurant in Waterloo) was what we stumbled upon.  We ordered mainly wings and skewers. China's late night drunk foods of choice includes meat skewers and they can range from super salty to charred and smoky. I've had better skewers but these were pretty good too. Though the restaurant is small and it was late, there were still other people. They ranged from mafia looking dudes to two ladies just getting off their restaurant shifts. All were having beer along with their snacks.  So why such a high rating? Well, the wings were seasoned and cooked beautifully; the service was great. The wings were tiny compared to your usually steroid-wings from St. Louis and the like - but that might not be such a terrible thing. Dry-seasoned, they were crispy (but not battered) on the outside and juicy on the inside. At two wings a skewer, it's a lil pricy. But they're done very well. My only complaint is that you go through a lot pretty quickly (especially when you gotta share with hungry guys).  We walked in at around 1am and stayed until almost 3. The sole girl managing the front of the restaurant was polite, responsive and cheerful. Yep, even that late at night. We only had a slight lost in translation moment but she was patient and worked with us, not against.  A part of the Chinese name of this restaurant translates directly to \"friends\". I think it captures the feel perfectly. You go here with your friends for a friendly experience. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A great place for Chinese BBQ dishes... We came to this place at 1am and ordered all kinds of meat, wings, and vegetables.. They all tasted amazing! This is a truly authentic Chinese BBQ place, will definitely come back for more !"}
{"text":"Noodle order didn't come for an hour. Ask few time never came...saying \"still need to finish all bbq orders for the other tables first!\""}
{"text":"spectacular skewers of various meats and offals grilled to perfection! this is a really great place for a late night munchies kick! lamb skewers and new Orleans grilled wings are a must have! and great for those who want a taste of the good old Beijing wing bar flavour!"}
{"text":"This Chinese late night grub food at it's finest. For the evenings when you are drunk and hungry or just hungry and want to get drunk this is where it's at. At least for you 905-er's.  These guys specialize in all things barbeque, more specifically Xinjiang style; wings, meats, organs (yes, it's true), seafood and vegetables. This stuff is spicy, crispy, fatty and smokey -- perfect paired with a pint! Except....stay away from their house draft (the cheapest on the menu); tastes like watered down cat-piss. The barbeque is delicious and can be a sensory overload with heavy flavours of garlic, cumin, paprika (chilli powder of some sort) and a generous dusting of fennel seeds.  This is an awesome place to hang out till 2am with a few friends. It doesn't get too busy but you may come across a few thugs/gangsters but that's ok, everyone is too busy eating and enjoying the food. Service is hit and miss like any Asian place however there is only one lady there that speaks English. Other times during her absence you will have to just point and order. It should not be too difficult to order as it's a self ordering system via written numbers on a piece of paper. If you do speak Mandarin, then you should have no problems.  There you have it. The late night de-facto, must hang-out joint in the 905!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of a Chinese BBQ restaurant in Scarborough, I decided to try this one in Richmond Hill. Came around 9pm for late dinner and only 3/7 tables were full - the place is quite small.   The lady serving us spoke in Cantonese and was very attentive. However, I was unimpressed by the lack of spice and seasoning in the skewers and wings. Lamb and beef were mediocre, cabbage was burnt, and wings were ridiculously small. Also, quite pricey for what you get. Don't think I'll be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Late night for this place isn't bad it's a good spot for skewers and beer within the area. My group got a beer tower. A bit expensive tho I believe it was $21-$22 for that, we had 4 people and each person only got 1 glass. It looks big but it cannot refill your glass a second time so pretty much I can say its not worth it amongst 4 people especially if your group can drink or will be drinking more..   Since the 2 other reviews below mine where mentioning about the Orleans chicken wings I had to go along with their choice and see if that flavor was any good! It was pretty good actually lol nice flavor and fried nicely. The lamb skewers weren't as good tho. We also ordered a soup noodle dish, which was also just mediocre..   The place is in the plaza on the east side of Highway 7. The plaza across from Commerce Gate. The store is located more in the interior space in between some other businesses. Overall, worth the try but not that good compared to other places.   Pros:   -Convenient if your in the area  - Easy to find  - Plenty of parking at night    Cons:   - Expensive for skewers and beer  - Service is a bit slow  - Small place not recommended for large groups"}
{"text":"Food was great at first.. Was a regular customer when they first opened, food was great, especially the lamb skewers and lamb noodles, but a bit pricy.. But food was great!  Too bad he chef left to a place called grill legend 15 minutes away,  Since the chef left, business has drastically slowed down and the food sucks now too,  The owner now doesn't even show up anymore, works a job elsewhere, food is burnt sometimes and still being served and charged for, food takes a long time to come out of the kitchen, cups are dirty.. Beer towers are dirty..  Don't want to go back ever!! But I have 1 friend keeps on saying lets meet at this restaurant.  If they don't improve their act, it's probably going to go under"}
{"text":"Chen's Wing Grill and Bar does have the potential to be one of the coolest joint in Richmond Hill for some late night snacks and a beer or 2.  Love the decor.   Food though was hit and miss. Mostly a miss.  BBQ Squid ($5.99) - so good!! Well seasoned and have a nice bite. BBQ Lamb Skewers ($5.99/3) - meh! served lukewarm and tasted bland. No hot off the grill taste BBQ Chicken Wings ($2.79) - Spicy and Honey. Not bad but for $2.79 each with just 2 wingettes?! $1.40 for a piece??!! Way overpriced! Spicy Potato ($5.99) - not spicy and bland. Potato was overcooked and not crunchy Grilled Eggplant ($2.59) - OK. But would not order again.  Service was slow. Tables never get cleaned unless new customers coming in and need to be seated. So I was looking at dirty plates everywhere on both side of our tables.   I don't think I will be coming back....."}
