{"text":"The jerk chicken at this place is one of the best in the city. I'm Jamaican and I know good jerk chicken when I taste it!"}
{"text":"They have a confusing digital menu, a vague and unhelpful take-out menu, and the portions aren't too large unless you pay like $12+tax.

So I go there and I say \"what is the daily special?\" ...she points at 3 Styrofoam containers labelled \"small, medium, large\". She says the daily special ($5.99) is the SMALL, you get your choice of type of chicken (they have 3 already prepared), with rice, and your choice of coleslaw or a canned drink. The small isn't that much food, in my opinion. So I look at this vague menu paper thing and notice that they have something called the \"jerk chicken combo\" for $7.99... surely that must be more food considering the price jump. So I inquire about that. She says it's the same thing, still the small with the same stuff, but you get both the coleslaw AND the canned drink. I was already going to choose the coleslaw as I have beverages at home, so you're saying for $2 more I get a can of pop? Wow.

Now we get into taste. The rice was decent... most of it had an oxtail sauce poured on top, which gave it flavour, but it was salty. The whole meal was too salty.

I go to other jerk chicken places not far away. The piece of chicken they cut up elsewhere is always boneless and juicy. Negril uses a bone-in leg/thigh that she chopped up with a cleaver, so I'm sitting here at home eating it picking out little pieces of bone fragments that are dispersed across the chicken. Good taste, poor eating experience.

The coleslaw? Pathetic. They put it in a thimble sized container and even then they only fill the container like half way. Taste? Way too sweet. Sickly sweet. I like my coleslaw to be tangy and rich, and not overpowered by sugar. It was barely two forkful of coleslaw, and it was not the best.

Having seen a customer right before me get a more appropriate sized meal and pay far more, I can say safely that I will not be returning. I'm thrifty and I know it... the value isn't there for me. The food has good taste but is overpowered by sodium. And my goodness the take-out menu couldn't possibly be more vague if they tried.

I saw this as a brand new restaurant to add to my choices, but it didn't impress me."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place since they put up their sign. They've only been open a few weeks, to my knowledge, and I thought I'd give them a try (I've tried most of the other restaurants in this plaza already). The interior is bright and clean. All or most of their food is already at the hot table. As soon as I walked in, I started to struggle. Their menu is on an electronic board that changes from time to time. It being my first time here, I had to wait to see how much food items costed. Before I had that time to wait, I was already being asked what I wanted. I asked for a menu. The lady at the counter handed me a small flyer/brochure thing (I don't want to call it a takeout menu because although it has menu items on it, it does not nearly contain their entire menu). 

This flyer/brochure thing has two categories: specials, and combo meals. That got me excited. I like specials, especially because they start at $3.75 and go up until $5.99. I then asked what the daily specials were. The lady smiled at me and told me that the specials went from Monday to Friday, 11am to 3pm. Um...lunch specials? The word lunch would have been helpful to put on those flyers. So would the time limitations. Okay. Fine. I'll see what the combos are. Combos start at $7.99. Combos include a small sized meal (as in the small square styrofoam box), a coleslaw (size of the smallest styrofoam sauce container), and a drink, if I'm not mistaken. Doesn't seem like much food for a combo.

Ended up getting a large chicken with rice (and coleslaw). $10.15 after tax. Comes with a quarter chicken and another piece. Got Jerk chicken (1/4), and a piece of fried chicken. As they chopped it up for me, a fairly large piece of the jerk chicken skin fell off. They did not put it back for me. I lost my piece of chicken skin. Sad. Rice and peas had very few peas/beans. They were quite generous with the oxtail gravy.  Chicken was moist, but overcooked (tender, but stringy?) Everything was a tad overly salted, save for the coleslaw. The coleslaw was sweet. I enjoyed my first few bites, but then it got cloyingly sweet and awkward tasting/feeling.

The food is not bad, but I can't justify the prices I'm paying for it, especially in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"The daily soups are WIKID at this restaurant!  I highly recommend the pea soup. It always has plenty of chicken, beef, dumplings and vegetables/provisions."}
