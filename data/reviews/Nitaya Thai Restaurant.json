{"text":"This restaurant is somewhere between two and three stars, but it doesn't quite deserve that third star. It doesn't really deserve even two and a half stars. Disclaimer, all I ordered and ate was the chicken pad thai. I called in to place my order and the woman who took my order was less than pleasant. She seemed to be in a rush to get off the phone. When I got there to pick up my order, it was almost completely empty. I also asked for an extra fork which was met by a look of disdain. Fine. The final cost was $12.16, which might be pretty steep for a late lunch (~4:45pm), but it would be worth it for delicious pad thai. 
When I opened the box, I found white noodles. WHITE NOODLES. I've had my fair share of pad thai, and while I may not be a fan of thai food in general, my favorite food, by far, is pad thai. Anyway, back to the white noodles. When I actually ordered this, I specifically asked for extra sauce. Every time I've ever eaten, or even seen for that matter, pad thai, they always have a rich brownish-(almost) reddish color (given by the tamarind used in traditional pad thai sauce). The first bite I took was lacking in flavor in almost every way, except for a mild sweet background flavor. Every bite after that got a little worse. A few squeezes of lime helped a bit, but it could only do so much. The chicken was entirely inedible. It tasted like chicken. And nothing else. As if they fried the chicken in its own juices and nothing else, not even salt. The egg had the same problem, but, to be fair, I'm not a fan of eggs to begin with. The only thing that makes the dish better than just one star was that the noodle quality was near-perfect. Long noodles go a long way in bettering an eating experience. They also kept their integrity, not falling apart and breaking as soon as you pulled them away from the eating container. That was the ONLY thing that kept this rating from being a one star.

If you didn't bother reading this entire review, let me just sum it up in one sentence: Go to Thara Thai; way better, cheaper, and bigger portions. And the BEST pad thai in Champaign."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there and I ordered the pad thai. I took a couple bites and noticed a hair in it. A black, curly-ish, 2 inch long, hair.  I was obviously disgusted and I told the waiter. I said I couldn't eat it and he turned and left. He didn't take the food away, apologize, or offer to bring me something else or a new plate of pad thai. He ran away because he didn't want to deal with it. So, then he finally comes back and tosses the bill on the table and leaves. I tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us! When he finally comes back I tell him that we're not paying for my meal since I couldn't eat it because of the hair. He said he'd ask his manager and when he finally came back he said they could take HALF off my dinner.  WHAT? Really? I took maybe 4 bites total before I found the hair and obviously didn't eat anything. Finally, he took the bill to his manager who took the pad thai off the bill. 

Also, the few bites of pad thai that I did have were awful. Not flavorful at all. The sauce was almost creamy. It was very different from any pad thai I've ever gotten and it was gross. 

I understand, sometimes things may end up in the food. I'll be reasonable about that. However when it does, make it right when it's brought to your attention. They didn't do that or even try. I will never be back."}
{"text":"First off, our waiter only understood about 25% of what we said.

When my \"red snapper\" with red curry sauce arrived and I took a bite, I realized it was talapia, and not red snapper. I hate the muddy flavor of talapia, and felt cheated because the dish cost $15.95.

Our waiter didn't return for about 18 minutes, so I went ahead and started eating the sauce with rice, just barely nibbling on the fish.

When he returned, I told him that the fish was talapia and not snapper. He checked with the chef and came back and verified my suspicions. I told him he should give us a discount since talapia is an inexpensive fish. He didn't understand and sent the manager over.

The manager insisted it was red snapper and tried to convince us of that by talking about the chilis and spices. Excuse me, I know that red curry sauce does not make red snapper taste like talapia. I cook Thai food at home. I know what different fish taste like.

She refused to give us a refund, and was not polite at all about the situation. If our waiter had shown up sooner, I would have just sent the dish back and ordered something else. (Of course, they probably would have tried to charge us for both!)

In addition to this, the dish was overly salty, over priced, and they used that granulated garlic that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth for two hours. We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered mock duck curry and mussamun curry. Very disappointed. Both Seemed very oily and extremely watery. The consistency of the curry was just not there. Potato in the curry tasted like it was canned. No authentic Thai flavors. Bland and tasteless. No taste of herbs or coconut milk. Have tried some of their noodles before which is good. Will probably give one more chance."}
{"text":"Bad service, horrific management, and food poisoning! First of all two people in our party were brought plain soda water instead of sprite and when the waitress took the glasses away to fix her mistake she never brought back one of the glasses. Then the waitress accidentally dumped salad dressing on my friend's coat and new purse. The manager brought her a wet towel and apologized but then at checkout denied the accident ever happened and refused to compensate my friend for her meal or the dry cleaning that was now necessary. I was unfortunate enough to get food poisoning from this establishment, and I know it was from them because I found a piece of raw chicken in my pad thai. It was so raw that I noticed it because it was rubbery! I turned down the offer for a new dish because I was so turned off by the raw chicken that I didn't want to eat anything else and they refused to comp the bad dish at checkout."}
{"text":"i had the kowtom soup when it was snowing (too much) for me and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!  i burned my tongue eating it but i couldn't stop myself :).  that is the only thing i order whenever i go there.  and the greatest thing about nitaya thai is that a friend of mine now likes pad thai (not an adventurous eater).  yay!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch special and spring roll for appetizer. Forgot the name of the lunch special. It was a stir-fried meat and vegetable dish with rice. It was too oily for me. The spring roll was awful-the skin of the roll was hard and the sauce didn't taste good. Thank to the lunch special the price was not expensive. But I think I'll never visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Decent pad thai that is prepared pretty quickly. I live right nearby and always order it for pickup, so have no personal experience with dining in or delivery. The prices are in line with other thai places around the area, but I have not been super impressed with any of their appetizers."}
{"text":"Some friends and I visited Nitaya Thai on Valentine's Day and it was okay.  I had the yellow curry with shrimp which tasted good, but I would have liked to have a larger portion.  The thai iced tea was delicious!  My friends' dishes looked delicious as well.  Service was pretty slow...the restaurant wasn't full but there were several tables seated.  They didn't seem to have many servers working.  I felt like it was a little expensive for what I got.  Overall, I'd probably return if I wanted Thai food and didn't want to leave downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Good food but they need to be more consistent. In fact, I think their food is the best Thai in town."}
{"text":"I won't be back. This was the worst Thai food I've ever had! They used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert. The chicken stays were microwaved. This experience was very disappointing. I'm giving it two stars instead of one star because the older gentleman server was nice. The older woman who started to serve me was not very nice at all."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We have gone twice, and both times were great. First we went for the lunch special and had green curry. They give you a free soup to begin, which was nice and warming. The curry was savory and creamy.
Today we went back for the regular priced menu, which was more expensive but had larger portions. I had the padthai, which was excellent. The waitstaff is friendly and professional. The only weird thing is how empty the place always is. (And the painting of Abe Lincoln is kind of odd too, but we are in Land of Lincoln here.) I wish more people would go so they don't have to close down or something.
There is free parking on the weekends in the big parking structure behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later."}
{"text":"Nitaya = good food, dated decor with the potential for not being very clean. Bottom line, though, is the food is good enough to trump the environs. Their Pad Thai with chicken is very good. The veggies are fresh, the spice is just right, and the flavor is outstanding. Their basil chicken and garlic chicken are also very good, as are the spring rolls and chicken satay. I find the portions to be more than enough and the pricing reasonable. Go trya Nitaya!"}
{"text":"Nitaya Thai never disappoints! It was the first place I had Thai. I have tried every other Thai place in town and I always am disappointed or wish I had gone to Nitaya instead! The crab Rangoon is amazing. I love the chicken satay with an amazing peanut sauce, as well as the spring rolls. My fav is the pad Thai. It is full of flavor. Be careful when choosing your spice level! Medium spicy is plenty spicy and I love spicy food."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and so I would not say there is anything wrong with the food here, but the guy who serves at dinner time sucks big time. 
We have been to this place for lunch and the girl out there is really courteous and nice. So we decided to visit the place for  dinner and 2 times that we have been there he has always disappointed us. You enter the place and he would say why don't you take the dinner menu and grab some place behind you, instead of taking us to seat and giving us the menu. You order appetizer and he would not bring the sauce and would instead stand there and play games on his phone. He would not ask if we need anything to drink, nor would he ever ask if everything tasted good.

I mean to say its a fine dining restaurant and not a fast food one. If you are prepared to be treated like that, visit it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai Food I have had in a long time.  They have the best Pad Thai in town.  I have lived and traveled to Thailand and can say that this place has the most authentic Thai Food in town.  If you are looking for real Thai food go here!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The egg noodle with roast pork was excellent. The fish cake appetizer was also quite good. I was born in Thailand and spent several years there so I know Thai food and I would say the dishes I had were high quality."}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch with some of my lab mates since it's pretty close. I've always ordered Pad Thai, and I like it. Maybe Thara Thai's a bit better, but I being no expert in Thai food at all, can't find much difference. Bottom line: I like Pad Thai, and I'm happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Very authentic thai food--once you get past the terrible (outdated decor), the fact that you are the only person in the restaurant, and the overly spiced curries. If you feel like a restaurant without that ambient atmosphere, but that is still pretty decent, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This review is for take out service. The girl at the counter was polite and friendly. She helped me select a delicious meal. I had the mango shrimp curry and a soup (coconut milk and chicken on it). While I was waiting she offered me water and my food was brought out within a reasonable amount of time.
Food: I felt both soup and curry to be very watery. The flavors were good but I expected that since the soup had coconut milk it would be creamier not like a broth. The curry was good a lot of curry not a lot of shrimp. But again the flavors of not the consistency were in point. Since I have not tasted a different type of Thai food I don't have a comparison point."}
{"text":"I am choosing to update my review as this is by far my families favorite thai place in town. My 7 year old step daughter loves it too. Never once have gotten sick like some previous yelpers have. Never once had a bad meal and I do like the cucumber water they bring you. 

No complaints and if you want great thai food...go here"}
{"text":"Nitaya's food is still only okay by way of Thai food, but the service is amazing.  So much so, that ti deserves a five star.  The server there, a funny, thoughtful guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!)

I showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem with her dish, he was kind, friendly and very cool about returning the dish for another.  He also managed to keep thte table constantly full of water or any other food items, which was fantastic.  The best part, however?

He made a reference to \"Pedagogy of teh Oppressed.\"  Any waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch.  Fantastic.

Now, can we make the food a bit more exciting next time?"}
{"text":"This is a really low key out of the way Thai joint with delicious chicken pad Thai! The price is a little high but the dish is worth it and you can call ahead for pick up so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"First problem:  Dear god I was taken aback by the menu prices when I first sat down.  Almost everything was well over $10 per meal, even the staple stuff.  I mean you'd think that since Nitaya's in a \"college town\" the prices would reflect the clientele that they're going to attract.  

Second problem:  No leftovers.  I was hungry but there's a universal understanding that Thai food portions should ALWAYS be big enough to make at least two meals out of.  That is a fact and Nitaya, to quote The Dude \"YOU FUCKED IT UP!  YOU FUCKED IT UP!\"

Lone positive:  As much as I bitch and moan, the Pad See Ewe was kind of really good and at the perfect level of spiciness."}
{"text":"Their food is average. I didn't hate anything but there's nothing too special about it. Their fried rice is pretty good, but doesn't make me want to go all the way to downtown Champaign for it. 

I did have a small problem with the service. There's not that many customers the few times I've visited this place, yet the server didn't even try to be attentive. We had to approach her to ask for whatever we needed. Kind of annoying. Besides that, it was okay."}
{"text":"Obviously being from central, rural midwest my range of Thai Food is pretty limited.  I have probably eaten at around 25 Thai Restaurants in my life, so take the review for what it is worth.

That said, this place was great.  I like my food really, really spicy.  Often I order it \"Thai Spicy\" and get something that barely makes me sweat.  Not the case at Nitaya, the fried rice and pad thai were packed with flavor, and spiced to perfection... about as hot as I can tolerate (which is how I ordered it).  Keep in mind I fix tacos with bhut jolokias and habanero peppers.  I like spicy food.

The setting was fun, service was great, mango sticky rice was fantastic.  Make sure if you're not a fan of cucumber water that you ask for tap.  

Overall, this is one of the best I have had in IL, ranging from Chicago to Carbondale. So far, it is my top in Champaign.  I can imagine that better exists (that mythical 5 stars), but I haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"Excellent Red Curry tonight with just the right amount of spiciness and a dash of the sweet and tangy Thai basil.  The Tom Kha Kai soup was very good as well - my wife and I split a small size for the perfect appetizer."}
{"text":"Nitaya Thai is a good Thai restaurant. The serving staff is always incredibly friendly but the food is sort of average at best. The portions were reasonably sized but the price seemed a bit higher than some of the other places in town. However, if you're craving Thai and are in downtown Champaign this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Nitaya serves authentic and savory Thai cuisine. Being the first in Champaign to introduce the specialty, paving the way for all the others. Our family loves their fried rice, pad thai and chicken wings - the best in town. A little bit of color change and some lighting perhaps to heightened ambience."}
{"text":"The rating couldn't say it better, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"

I suspect that in the past few months they have raised prices, because I do not recall price being the issue with my meal. The problem with Nitaya Thai, for me, is that it reminds me of a higher calibre Basil Thai. Neither the curries nor the noodle dishes are very good, and the service doesn't make up for this. Go to Thara Thai, which is a bit pricey, but so, so worth it!"}
{"text":"i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the second one (Nitaya Thai) bests the other two on location, downtown Champaign. it's within walking distance of good coffee, music shows, beer, etc. that being said, the basil chicken is alright, not as good as Thara Thai's but better than Basil Thai's (if you can even call their dish \"chicken\"). Nitaya's chicken is a bit on the dry side, the rice portion was generous, but cold even though i arrived on time (i had take-out). if you are dining in, the booths are nice, but don't expect anything posh."}
{"text":"I had high(er) hopes for Nitaya Thai, mostly because it's so close to my house.  Alas, it's just okay.  The prices are kind of high for a just-okay-thai-place in Champaign.  But the atmosphere was alright and the waiter was nice.

The Crab Rangoon was tasty (it'd be hard to make it gross), but it was too thin and greasy for my liking.  The boy's Red Curry was not bad at all, and was a very appropriate level of spiciness.  I thought I'd try the Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles), as I'd never tried it before.  In theory, I would've really liked it.....but Radio Maria's Korean Hot Pot Food Poisoning Delight has ruined me forever.  I couldn't tolerate the spicy-sweetness of the dish in combination with the slimy noodles.  It turned my stomach.  I poured some of the boy's curry sauce over my dish which helped make it more palatable....but I couldn't eat the noodles.  Yuck.  Not Nitaya's fault, but it doesn't help its case."}
{"text":"WARNING CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARDS AND BILL!!! REFUSED TO REFUND FRAUD CHARGES!!!

Me and my friend were double charged on our credit cards! When I called, the manager asked if I could come to the restaurant because she didn't understand, it was inconvenient but ok fine.  BUT when I came in she wouldn't refund me!! The manager and I discovered that my meal should have actually cost $14.24(+3 tip) and the waitress added an extra $4 more dollars!! Then when I asked to be refunded the double charge and the over charge of the meal THE MANAGER REFUSED!! She told me I should have handled it that night.  I had to dispute it from the credit card company. The sad part? The food wasn't even good :(  

After talking to a few people from the area about the situation, they all said this is the worst Thai in town.

UPDATE: After 2 months the credit card issue was resolved. After Capital One contacted them and made them issued a refund, they dragged their feet a month later and did it. Capital One asked for them to show signatures/receipts for the charges and they couldn't provide receipts. 

What's worse? I tried to explain that to the owner at the beginning when it happened that the credit card company will make them issue the refund if they can't show proof, and she didn't care.

DONT EAT HERE unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and the food is always pretty dang decent.  For some reason this place is kinda the greasy spoon of Thai spots in Chambana.

Their pad thai is fairly good.  It's not drowned with peanut sauce so you can actually taste the tamarind.  The portions were plenty for two ladies to eat their fill; their was actually about a half serving left over.

The decor is dated classic for a Thai restaurant.  They have a full bar, which is really nice.  A strong IPA pairs well with most everything on the menu.

Their green curry is delectable.  Flavor spot-on.  I ordered the spiciness level at American hot.  It was amazing- just on the verge of being too spicy for me.  Love when the heat is a challenge and my face turns red and the tears threaten to well up.  Perfection!

The tom kah was fairly good.  They use regular ol' domestic button mushrooms, which is one complaint I have about both Nitaya and Siam Square.  Tom kah should be made with straw mushies.  Straw!

Nitaya does go the extra mile of slicing the shrooms thin and sauteeing them before addition to the soup.  This makes a world of difference and is much more close to the flavor I'm seeking in this particular soup.

I'd probably give this joint four stars if not for the outrageously inflated prices and the fact that although they are listed as a delivery restaurant they never have had a driver when I try to order from work."}
{"text":"EW!!! Avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs!! The food was mediocre, the restaurant was empty, and the booths were from 1975. We got chicken curry (meh, watery), pad thai (unmemorable), and crab Rangoon (not bad except ummm no crab or crab flavor), and dynamite rolls (weird, mediocre).  

Then, my boyfriend got FOOD POISONING for the first time in years. We eat out all the time, we eat at Thai places frequently, he didn't not order anything unusual for him. I called the owner to inform her and ask for a refund. 

The conversation with the owner was unbelievable, laughable at best. She kept repeating she sold so many curries last night and no one else complained. She demanded to know what else we ate. and if he was allergic to anything he ordered. I proceeded to explain we did not eat anywhere else and the timing was about right for salmonella. 

She was defensive, argumentative, and inappropriate. At one point she HUNG UP ON ME! She states because she didn't hear me speak. Because I was stunned for 3 seconds at something incredulous that she had said, don't remember what bc there was so much. When she told me salmonella only takes 2 hours, I informed her no it doesn't, and I'm a physician I know it takes about 8 hours onset. 

She then proceeded to mock me and say that what kind of doctor are you? You should be nice to the people and high degree you should be professional. She kept interrupting and at one point, OUT OF THE BLUE, she asked me if I was married and had kids! I told her that was irrelevant and inappropriate and she said something to the extent of, \"you're mean and that's why you're divorced\". 

!!!!?? 
I've never been married or divorced and I'm not sure how that comment is allowed from a business owner to a customer. ?!

Anyway, reporting her to the health department. Can I report her to the police too for verbal assault? Haha."}

{"text":"this was the must disgusting restaurant I have eaten at in years.  We ordered the dumplings and they arrived freezer cold.  Really.  When we sent the dish back, they came back with the same dumplings, just warmed up.  Ok, could have lived with that.  Green curry arrived with hair in both the rice and the curry dish.  The hair was long and black sticking out of the mound of rice on the plate.  When the replacement rice came back from the kitchen, it was the same rice, just forked through to remove the hair.  Next up was going to the bathroom.  As you walk to the back of the restaurant, the floor, walls, etc get dirtier and dirtier - and then look to the left and you'll see the same dirt and chaos in the kitchen.  This place is a health hazard."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Pad Thai from this place. They can even specialize yours by making it more spicy if you want. 

It always seemed like this place was dead, but their food was really good at a reasonable price and the staff was friendly and fast, so I don't know why. 
Paking was a little annoying though, but I guess all of downtown is kinda like that."}
{"text":"We ate tonight at Nitaya, and our food was excellent.  I had the Pineapple Chicken Curry and my wife had a Modified Number 77.  We had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and Mango for dessert.  The only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated, but for authentic Thai, this was it.  The service was great and no problems with English understanding him or us."}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food.  My only issue is that the portions could be a little bit bigger.  I ordered the Pad-see-ew and was glad the chicken resembled chicken.  The noodles were coated with the correct amount of sauce, and there was plenty of broccoli.  Friendly staff.  The space is weird, but makes it different."}
{"text":"Nitaya, how do you survive?  When I come by, you're so empty inside that I can always hear the wok frying behind the walls.  At school, the kids pick their teams, and no one ever picks you as their favorite.

Honestly, given the competitiveness of Thai restaurants in town and the steep rental prices for property in downtown Champaign, how does Nitaya make it?  The food is not offensively bad, just forgettable.  I've sampled their curries and noodle dishes but nothing invokes the vividly bright, colorful senses that I associate with Thai cooking.  My entrees there are often limp and sad (but maybe I can blame that on the lighting...?).

If you want to go on a serious date for Thai food, Nitaya Thai could serve as an appropriate setting.  The interior decor is immediately recognizable as an oh-so-camp, tropical-themed '80s bar, with wicker chairs and faded turquoise booths.  There's something undeniably charming about the setup, but unfortunately it lacks the warmth that only a crowded dining room can offer."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with GrubHub on a Friday afternoon.

Delivery was much faster than expected. GrubHub stated 60-90 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes, so that was good.

I ordered pad thai beef, some crab rangoons, and my friend got the sweet and sour chicken.

The rangoons were underwhelming. They tasted good but appeared to be seriously lacking any crab. Of the 5 that were there, I think maybe one had enough crab to actually taste.

My pad thai beef was very good. After the rangoons I thought for sure I wouldn't be impressed but this was some good pad thai. It had a semi-sweet, nutty flavor and blended together quite well. The beef seemed to be of decent quality, and tender. The portion was fairly large, too. My gripes with the pad thai was that it didn't appear to be that spicy. I feel like since I ordered with GrubHub I was not able to choose how spicy my dish was, like you often can if you go in and order in the restaurant. So, by default, I think I got very mild pad thai, which was good, but a little spice would have made it great. My other issue was the fairly high cost. The pad thai itself was $9.99, but because I got beef, it was a few dollars, making this an over $12 dish. I probably should've just stuck with the chicken.

My friend said the sweet and sour chicken wasn't bad, but I didn't get to try it.

Overall, the food was good but I felt very high priced. GrubHub charged a $5 delivery fee, and I also needed to pay the driver a tip, plus tax, made our lunch over $20/person, which I felt was far too much.

For less than $10 I can get comparable pad thai on campus at Bangkok 911, and also get to choose the level of spiciness there. I think I'll just do that next time."}
{"text":"Pretty OK Thai food. 

The crispy noodle was good, not very greasy and full of fresh veggies, the Pad thai spicy and savory, but that was the first time I went. Returned on another occasion to find an oily pad kee mao. Friends had a nice penang curry. I wonder if it depends on the cook? Not sure who was behind there but the two different times I went seemed to be two different cooking styles, the first being very good and representative Thai restaurant, the second time just a sub par Chinese restaurant. So three star average for the two.

Here spicy really means spicy. Sure I'm a light weight be I could hardly eat more than a bite of the 'mild'."}
{"text":"The food is good here, quite good actually. I give it two stars because it is far too expensive for what it is. I speculate that the high prices are to cover the overhead on the large (in sq. ft.) restaurant area, or maybe they use really high-quality ingredients in some dishes and spread the cost of those over their cheaper dishes. I say this b/c I have only gotten pretty simple stuff like pad thai, tom ka, and curries from them (no fancy fish or meat) and have always felt that I overpaid by at least 50%. 

IMHO, Nothing about this place justifies the excessive prices (though the dope mural outside comes close). The quality of the food is about on par with or slightly higher than Thara Thai, but the prices are nearly double."}
{"text":"the 1st time I ever had Thai food was here, this place is so wonderful!!! Feels like your at Mom's house being served hot/fresh, delicious food. Sweet Sweet, fast wait staff, lovely environment
If only I'd written this review so much sooner *smh* soooo yummy"}
{"text":"This is not good Thai food. It's not even Thai food. My chicken pad thai did not even taste remotely like any other pad thai anywhere. It was a bland mess of noodles with some asian-ish flavor for $12. I also requested 'very hot'. The server asked me, \"medium hot?\" I said, no, very hot. As hot as you can make it. There was not a single pepper flake in my dish. Or any spice. Of any kind. At all.

Okay.

I wanted to give them 2 stars because the atmosphere is cool. They have a great location. And our server was nice. They served us cucumber water, but he was happy to give us regular iced water instead. But I just can't justify giving their food more than 1 star. I've had better pad thai for $5. Let alone $12. MAYBE they have non-thai food that's okay? Like I've heard about their soups? But I have no interest in that.

Seriously, if you want Thai food: Go to Thara Thai, My Thai, or basically anywhere with the word 'Thai' in the name other than Nitaya Thai. I had an enjoyable lunch there. But I'm sorry to say that it wasn't due to the food."}
{"text":"Old school Thai restaurant.  My motorcycle club usually have dinner here at least once or twice a year and we all really enjoy it.  It's not really been that busy on our recent visits which concerns me because I've really had good meals here.  I enjoy their Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Fried Rice, Chicken Pad Se Ew (spelling?), and a rice bean noodle dish I love.  I order everything Medium, heat wise and it's still pretty hot.  Four years ago I mistakenly ordered hot and it burned twice!

The place doesn't appear to be very clean and the restrooms are a hike from the table and kind of sketchy but the staff are very nice and attentive.  Food is good too."}
{"text":"I go here fairly often simply because I live so close and crave Thai food fairly often. That being said, it's definitely not my favorite place in the area.

The food is decent, I usually get the panang noodles, thai iced tea, and spring rolls. But eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes. It's usually pretty empty, the staff is usually watching movies in the bar area, and the place is generally not very clean.

I guess if you're really in the mood for thai, super close, and don't have much to spend this is your spot."}
