{"text":"The creek patio is probably the best place to fill this location. The menu is a large selection of American style foods. The Asian style wings were crunchy and delicious, the pretzels were sub par. We had the spinach pizza which had a delicious crust but somewhat over loaded the garlic. The sweet potatoe fries were super crunchy so we devoured every last crumb. Another amazing appetizer we enjoyed as an entree was the Bang Bang shrimp, and man I would go back just to enjoy 8 of those for 8 dollars on happy hour.  The pork sliders were good but a little spicy and overall smokey. The creek brownie sounded good but we chose to enjoy a chocolate shake, it was nothing out of the park but still yummy. This place will definitely be visited again to enjoy happy hour."}
{"text":"Have been to Happy Hour before and lunch today.

Loved the Caprese and the Green mussels are very tasty.....might want to avoid if you don't enjoy spices.

Nice atmosphere and my husband liked the pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to the Creek several times now and have never been disappointed.  They have some great sauces for their seafood and the burgers and pizza are very good.  It is nice to have a reasonably priced high quality restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"so glad to have food the Creek when i moved to the area late last year.  an avid happy hour participant, i spend many a friday evening at the bar with friends.  We love Chris the friendly bartender man! even with other places close by, the laid back, friendly vibe of the Creek and the AWESOME FOOD keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"We went there Sunday night. I soon as we sat at the bar the bartender ignored us were at least five minutes. When he finally did wait on us he was very of obnoxious. He made fun of my drink order. He made fun of my food order. He waited on this favorite person next to us before us and we were there five minutes ahead of him. He made more snide remarks,so we got up and left. 
Might try again on a different night with a different bartender. 
Ron"}
{"text":"Service was slow and couldn't get our orders straight."}
{"text":"The food is really good and priced well. Have tried many of the dishes and they were all excellent. The best thing about the place is the excellent staff who are at your beck and call with fast service and excellent suggestions. Love this place."}
{"text":"We had a party of eight last evening.  None of us had ever been to the Creek Patio Grill before.  We were seated promptly.  Our waitress, Michelle, came to the table right away and took drink orders.  She was friendly and efficient.  Our drinks arrived and she took our dinner orders which wasn't an easy task as we were not sitting with spouses but we asked for separate couples' checks which she was amenable to.  We each ordered something different and everyone was pleased with their food.  A friend stopped by the table to say hi and said you can order anything as everything is good!  And it was.  The manager/owner stopped by to make sure we were all happy.  Michelle was awesome and worked very hard to keep us well supplied with drinks and good food.  We will definitely return especially when the weather is nice as the patio looks inviting."}
{"text":"really good food. had to wait for an hour tonight to be served but spoke to a manager who helped me out nicely. excellent customer service. the girl with short hair and tattoos is also very kind and pretty-- she is always friendly and smiling!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We got the pretzels and bang bang shrimp for appetizers and what a perfect choice!! My sis and I split the vegetarian pizza with the house salad, my husband had the prime rib dip sandwich, and my brother-in-law had the wings. We all were very happy with our choices- so much so we went back the next night! This time I got the wings with honey BBQ sauce, my sis got the spicy chicken sandwich, my husband got the wings, too, and my brother-in-law got one of the burgers. Just as good as the night before! Awesome ambiance! We sat in the bar area both nights. We would have liked to sit at the bar but they're weren't 4 available seats together. (happy hour is a busy time)  Awesome staff! We were lucky enough to get the same server both nights- Sarah- she was wonderful! Spot on and didn't forget one thing!!  If you're thinking about going--  stop thinking and go!!"}
{"text":"We ordered two burgers, which were both raw and had to be sent back.  We were sat at a very small table, which was next to a large party, it was very hard to have a romantic dinner.  The glasses and beer were both warm.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Good food but servers run around not knowing who gets which order why is that ?!asking everyone while food gets cold?!
My daughter in law got the wrong order and she was told oops eat it you will like it 
A chili burger vs burger she ordered
She said ok reluctantly because she didn't want to delay the meal for others as it had already taken 30 min plus 
She didn't like it and wasn't checked on my the waitress 
The waitress paid a lot of attention to a group of near by ?flirting or friend 

We had to ask for drink refills and the check
We won't be back
 
Like the new Tailgaters better
You are up for some competition."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have this great restaurant bar open up. This is by far the best establishment at this specific location. The food, service, and ambience make this a fantastic place to spend happy hour. This place is hard to beat and  I predict that it's going to become a very popular bar restaurant in this area.  My wife and I are definitely going to be \"regulars\" here."}
{"text":"Several visits and thus far everything ordered was great. Taste, portion size & service all good."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. We both had grilled chicken sandwiches and were very happy with how the chicken was cooked. In our experience, most restaurants tend to overcook the chicken, making it very dry. This was definitely not the case at The Creek Patio Grill. We had a great server named Andrew who was helpful, yet not overbearing. Over the course of our dinner, both the manager and owner each came to our table to check in with us. We were surprised to learn they have only been open for 5 weeks, because everything was great and we have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Overall we are really hopeful for this new neighborhood restaurant! The food and service were great. However, a few kinks need to be worked out in the kitchen- which is to be expected in the first week of opening. We started with the spinach/artichoke dip which was delicious, and then followed with the margarita pizza and BBQ chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries- everything tasted wonderful! Unfortunately, I received my pizza about 10min before my boyfriend got his sandwich but the server was great and took care of our drinks. We will be back to try again once they have been open a little while longer!"}
{"text":"Get rid of your moldy smell as you walk in or that old grease smell? Either way it turns me off. Doesn't matter what your food is like until you correct this huge problem."}
{"text":"We really like the Bang Bang Shrimp. There are 8 large shrimp w/slaw and a spicy drizzle. Great for sharing!!! Pizza has nice crust and we can get a Gluten Free Crust for $2 more and it is really good. A little smaller but tasty! We go quite often and it is consistently great! They are very attentive and if you share a meal they are very accommodating. All types of seating - lots of tables in the Bar and also regular seating. It's is Busy and we like that!!! Great Happy Hour Every Day usually 3 to 7pm but in July 11am to 7pm every day!"}
{"text":"Great service. The appetizers are to die for. The bang bang shrimp and bbq ribs are a 10. Great to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood.  Prices are reasonable. Go to happy hour."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar right now... bartender acted like it was a great chore to ask me what I wanted... then witnessed a very public argument between bartender and barback about who's duty it was to bring silverware to customers. Gravely unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"Great service by thomas in the dinning area and sam in the bar. Food was excellent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are always great at The Creek for pretty reasonable prices. The problem with the Creek is the service. Very few of wait staff are decent. You usually end up waiting too long to have your order taken, drinks, delivered and refilled, and food delivered. We've even had to wait a long time for the check. One waiter in particular was rude when we asked him what the flavor of the rub was and he said \"well it should be obvious\". Then even he brought ribs instead of the wings we ordered he told us he was sorry we didn't communicate well. Last Friday, March 9th, the hostess was rude. We were told our wait would be 20th minutes, after waiting 30 we asked if we would still get happy hour prices of we weren't seated before happy hour ended, she told us no we should have gotten there earlier if we wanted to be sure to get happy hour prices. A simple,  I'm sorry no would have been fine."}
{"text":"I've not had anything here I wouldn't recommend. Never disappointed. Sat on the patio with my sister. Hostess and wait staff were friendly and quick. 

We had Coconut Chicken as an appetizer, French Dip and Maui Sandwich. I would repeat the same order, delicious."}
{"text":"This has become one of our go-to places and still love it!

LOOOOVE the patio and service is always great. 

Green Chili Corn Chowder is always a must. Large menu and always had everyone we have brought find something they like."}
{"text":"Excited to have another restaurant in our area. Went and sat in the bar for dinner and drinks tonight. After sitting at the bar we were asked if we wanted a drink and received a menu and were told of new items on the menu. 
After  8 -10 minuets of waiting to place a dinner order, I had to ask if we could order our dinner from someone other than the bartender who was too busy socializing with other people at the bar. 
Once we received our food, which was wonderful, we were never asked if the food was ok or if we wanted another drink. I guess the bartender was too busy talking with another couple if we wanted anything else. 
After we left very disappointed with the lack of not even mediocre service I call The Creek to speak with a manager regarding our experience to hopefully use our experience as a training tool. I was told the manager was too busy cleaning tables to discuss the service we experienced. 
I'm afraid The Creek will not last with this type of culture that is passed down from the top down. Too bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a mini vaca in Scottsdale ~
 Nice place it was Saturday lunch so not very busy. Nice menu options and good specials.
   We shared a pizza \"special for the day\"  & we ate it all, my daughter ordered a kale (bleh!) salad which she liked and aside that I don't like kale her salad looked good~
   No cocktails just water & ice tea for us. Based on the menu if I lived in the area I would frequent this establishment"}
{"text":"I agree with the person that wrote about the smell. It was still there today and very noticeable as soon as you walk in.

We went for appetizers and drinks. Service was good. Margarita pizza was good but sloppy made. More attention need to be made to details---like making sure cheese was on every slice! Also had the shrimp which was good. The cheesecake was really good. Drinks are cheap during happy hour. No problem with the service.

3 stars because of the smell and the sloppiness of the food."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for Sunday brunch and enjoyed ourselves - especially with the modern and updated atmosphere. We got the pancakes (good but nothing super special), the breakfast burrito which was good, and the short rib breakfast which was very good. Service was good. I strongly support the efforts of a small business, so the only reason I rated this a 4 was due the the very spotted silverware and glassware. So spotted, that we had to double check everything at first because we couldn't tell if it was dirty, dusty, or just spotted from the wash. All in all, we will be back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is great. My rating reflects only their Happy Hour as this was our first visit to Creek Patio Grill. This was our first visit but definitely won't be our last. The food was fantastic - certainly not your normal Happy Hour bar food. The service was also very good. I highly recommend this place and we look forward to returning for lunch & dinner."}
{"text":"They need to be more careful with their preparation. Hamburgers were well done when I asked for medium rare. Shrimp cocktail was served warm which should be chilled. The lamb chops though were very good."}
{"text":"I can say now that after visiting The Creek a few times now that it is one of our favorite places to go. Nice atmosphere and the food is delicious. Kids love the pizza, burgers and fries. They share the pretzel bites before the food comes. I love the Bang Bang shrimp and the green chili corn chowder. The staff is really friendly as well and food comes out quick."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this restaurant last night since it was close to home. The truth is the food was great, our waitress Ellen was super nice and accommodating. 
I really recommend this place and we are going back soon."}
{"text":"We have heard about this place and decided to try it out. Called and they don't take reservations Friday or Saturday night and good for them. We went anyway and they have a lot of \"fist come first serve\" tables in the bar. We got a table after one loop around the bar. Ellen was our waitress and she was awesome! We had some questions about the menu, she made some recommendations and she was spot on. We tried the lettuce wraps, some shrimp appetizer, and the filet bites. Everything was perfect and FAST, but not hurried. We will definitely make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Really nice brunch with a solid menu and tasty Bloody Marys. We had a friend suggest this place to us and we now owe her lunch for the great meals. We have been 3 times and every time it was excellent."}
{"text":"I am definitely coming back, this spot has it all. It has a bar, has a couple tables near the bar as well as some sections towards the back for a more quiet meal. They have a pizza oven in the middle of the restaurant which I though was kind of cool.

The menu has a little bit o everything I was here on Saturday but the menu mentions taco Tuesday deals and Sunday brunch. 

I was craving a burger and this place has some of the best reviews for burgers around. I got a $4 dollar blue moon and a huge burger the size of my face. I barely finished the thing and my girlfriend only finished half of hers. We had the French fried and the cut fries and they were both excellent. She also ordered corn chowder soup which pero si ally I had never had at it was amazing! 

I look forward till my next visit!"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened in cave creek! The happy hour offers great specials and a rotating beer selection, if you stay for dinner, the chicken Parmesan sandwich or any of the salads are all fantastic!  A nice comfortable atmosphere and an upscale bar area. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the appetizers, though tasty, were really tiny portions. If they called the wings chicken \"bites\" instead, then at least we would know what to expect! Otherwise great food, drinks and friendly consistent service!"}
{"text":"Solid food.  A welcome addition to this space after so many failures.  Drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Good food.  This place has been through a few incarnations.  This time works!  Great happy hour!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Wow.  How in the heck this place got four stars is beyond me. All of the food was so bad. The atmosphere is totally lacking and made us feel almost depressed when we walked in...just no.  All of it including the music was just awful.  The only redeeming factor of our entire visit was our server. She was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"In AZ for a couple of days and a friend of mine recommended this place for drinks and appetizers.

Very nice atmosphere. Lots of TVs. Very nice patio. Service was excellent. Nice draft selections.

Star of the show food wise was the bang bang shrimp. Delicious! We shared it and I wished we didn't! I needed a plate of that stuff all to my self and the next time I am there, I will do just that!

Buffalo wings were winglets. I was hoping for whole wings @ a nice place like this. Both of my friends enjoyed their salads.

This place is cool like a pair of Dolce and Gabbana DG2027B sunglasses."}
{"text":"Just had apps and drinks at the bar. The bartenders were awesome and very welcoming. Good food and good vibe. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"On the surface, the Creek is a great place and I frequent it a lot due to limited options, but they miss the target on a few things.  For starters, the bathrooms smell worse than most outhouses.  It shouldn't be that hard to address a sewer issue and flush the lines.  Service is hit or miss on who is working.  Its also somewhat of a family staffed business and that has its advantages and disadvantages as those employees that fall short on service delivery will most likely not receive any sort of feedback or training to correct the service.  Again, I don't want to have to go elsewhere.....please fix the sewer smell.  I can live with the other issues."}
{"text":"Had a super awesome time with friends! Food and drinks where great! I would highly recommend this for date night or group get togethers."}
{"text":"Really like the place and the food was great! The service was a bit slow, but we will be going back."}
{"text":"By far our favorite place to eat. Great assortment on menu , food tastes great , big portions and reasonable prices. Servers are friendly and efficient. Manager is caring , understanding and goes above and beyond to insure your dining experience is great!!"}
{"text":"They have the best buttermilk fried chicken ever! Omgoodness sooo good! I have not had a bad meal here yet and I ordered several meals before I discovered the chicken! Lol I'll probably get the chicken every visit from here on!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied wroth portions and service. Shoestring fries were delicious! Owner Mike came and asked how our meal was. Only downfall is that we ordered a BBQ burger and got a BBQ chicken sandwich instead."}
{"text":"We had our daughter's sweet 16 birthday party here. It was great! Chase was our waiter and he went above and beyond for us. Thank you Chase!! He recommended great entrees for dinner. We had the Shrimp Alexander. It
 was delish!! Thanks again for making everything run smoothly."}
{"text":"Absolutely would not recommend eating here unless you like to dine with other peoples uncontrolled dogs in the dining room!! Very unhealthy and areas not cleaned after peoples dirty dogs roam around. The manager doesn't know what a service dog is. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"This place has been though many changes in the last few years but I have to say...what it is today is a wonderful place to dine.  Service was friendly and efficient and the food was wonderful.  Great menu for the kids and will definitely go back.  Well done on all the changes!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and enjoyed the Spinach Salad and Spicy burger. Sweet potato fries with the aioli were great!! The restaurant is large and obviously western themed. Our server was very friendly and helpful. We sent back the Kung Pao fries because the sauce was way too heavy. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"This place is a family friendly and has the BEST burgers ever. The spicy burger is always my first choice.  Friendly staff, great food not much more you can ask for in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is always great except tonight. DO NOT ORDER THE SHRIMP ALEXANDER!!  How is it that it only has 4 TINY shrrimp and it costs $11. The Bang Bang shrimp has about 8 huge shrimp and it costs $11 as well.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I normally go on Sundays because it's my day off and Danielle and another gentleman are always behind the bar and they are both pretty awesome. I always get this pineapple mule and oh my gosh, I can literally drink 4-5 they are so good. The food as well...the apps alone are worth it. The coconut chicken is my fave but they have these veal sliders I think that I tried and they were awesome as well. Just a really cool, chill place!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad they open this place.  It has had many incarnation, but I think this one is the best.  The restaurants has been completely remodeled and it is very nice and HUGE! They offer a nice happy hour and the food is very good.  I have been here several times with different friends.  The Bang Bang shrimp is one of my favorite. One night we ordered almost all the shared plate with another couple we went.  The filet bites were juicy and tender, my girlfriend loves the pretzel bites, they are super yummy, I always grab a couple or four.  The shrimptini is my go to when I want to \"be good\".  My favorite by far is the G.C.B. burger.  My husband had ordered pizzas before, however I have not tried them.  Our favorite cocktail is the Prickly Pear Margatini, so refreshing.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is good for bar type food and the pizza is excellent. The service was fine on the night I went and our waiter was very friendly and pleasant. I would have given 5 stars but I believe the food items are a bit pricey especially the appetizers which cost as much as the entrees. I would highly recommend the pizza during happy hour when it is discounted."}
{"text":"Love this place! Anytime we have company we love to bring them here. The bang bang shrimp is to die for! Such a cute place inside and when the patio is open we love bringing our dog with!"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of positives from people who love this place we finally had the chance to check it out. The restaurant itself is quite nice with lots of outdoor seating for when the weather is good. The menu seems to have a little bit of everything from burgers and pizzas, to steak and lamb chops.

Our table of 4 ordered the honey BBQ wings and the king pao fries. The wings were fine and the fries had incredible potential if only they had been cooked a minute longer so they were crispy. Don't get me wrong...we still ate them as they were yummy. Around our table I saw I giant sausage pizza that looked fabulous, lamb chops, a steak with a side of mac and cheese and my own Hawaiian chicken sandwich. My sandwich came with a side of shoestring potatoes. The sandwich was good but I had to pull the pineapple out to keep the whole thing from falling apart.

I would have liked to give them 4 stars but the service just wasn't that great and that is a big part of the experience. It took a while for someone to come take our drink order. The appetizers arrived in a timely manner but the serving of the entrees was staggered. The pizza arrived several minutes before everyone else's food and then the steak order arrived a few minutes after everyone else was served. Then the waiting began again for the check. It was a Friday night and who knows, maybe our server was new. I am totally willing to give them another chance in hopes of bumping them up a star."}
{"text":"Not impressed cold wings the burger was good only 5 draught beer selections 2 of witch were not working slow service this is headed the same direction the previous restaurant same owner imange that Bring back Cocomo Joes and the Pittsburgh wings!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch menu, plenty of options from Chicken & waffles to breakfast pizza to my favorite Short Rib breakfast. Also bottomless mimosas for $12, yes please. The staff is always friendly and treat you like family. Ellen is wonderful and very attentive. She always makes sure your glass is never empty and makes great menu recommendations. Fun over-all vibe to this place that makes you want plan an immediate return visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner on a whim and didn't disappoint. The happy hour specials are pretty awesome. We had drinks and shared a few appetizers. The blue cheese wedge salad was good and the filet mignon bites were excellent. The atmosphere and vibe is great. Love the giant wooden front door! It's everything from shorts and tee shirts to those dressed up. The bar was rocking so we opted to wait for a table and found ourselves in a big comfy booth after a short wait. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that we ordered draft beers and the Guinness was not cold, bummer. So we asked our waiter to instead bring a vodka and Red Bull and it had about 3 ice cubes in it, which isn't so refreshing on a day it's 115 out. Besides that, we had a great time and would love to return when it's cooler and the patio is open, which looks really welcoming!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but it's just half-baked with VERY slow service and utterly forgettable food.  Our server didn't write down our order, then came back 30 minutes after taking it to ask us all again what we ordered??? We asked if he'd forgotten to put it in and were told \"no, I'm just checking to make sure I remember (uh, huh)\", then 25 minutes after the \"check-up\" the order finally arrives.  All of that would be just annoying if the food was good, but sadly it just wasn't, it was very unremarkable bar food and just not worth putting up with the horrible service for.  Save your money and grill a burger at home or hit In-N-Out, you'll save a bunch of money and have a far better experience."}
{"text":"My first visit and Chris was the bartender the service was excellent, had the bang bang shrimp which were delicious and a peppercorn burger very tasty great service"}
{"text":"We arrived at about 8:00 on a Thursday night and were a little surprised to see the hostesses back to us. She was on the phone and after a couple minutes she turned and saw us, but didn't say one word to us. She turned her back to us again and continued her phone call. A few minutes later, she acknowledged us and sat us. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was okay. My husband ordered wings, that were not good at all, and a pizza, which was average. Our server was very good and attentive, however she couldn't make up for the poor greeting and the lack of satisfaction from our dinner."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and each time the food has been good and the service strong. Prices are very reasonable. This has been a tough location for others and I hope the current ownership can keep this running. Happy hour 7 days per week, 3-7pm, which includes $8 pizzas that can easily feed two. The Bang Bang shrimp was very good and the spicy buffalo wings were solid. Kids said the pizza was close to the best they've ever had. Spicy chicken sandwich was just ok. The brownie was really good too!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, and the staff were great - sometimes too bubbly though.  Our meals - a salad and a big bowl of mac and cheese - were just OK.  I was expecting a quality mac like they've got over at black mountain grill, but I wouldn't be surprised if it came straight from a box of kraft mac and cheese with some bacon added. 

We also tried the pretzels and dip. Again, underwhelmed compared to black mountain. Maybe this place is in business to make black mountain look good? 

We'll likely visit again, but I would not recommend the mac. The pizza looked worthy, as did the burgers. Maybe we'll choose wisely next time."}
{"text":"Open 9 days they say and doing a super job. The waiter was a little confused about the menu but he found out the right info for us and had a great attitude.  We had the brick oven pizzas...margarita (fresh basil) and BBQ chicken (fresh cilantro), great taste and great crust. Happy hour wines and house wines for 5$ all day. Great price and great food!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
$12 bottomless mimosas !!!!!!
Great CHEAP breakfast, wish I lived closer, I would be at this bar 
every weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing...again!

Brought my mom who was visiting from Iowa...She had the Walleye and I had a Fast Food Burger...both...AMAZING!  What can we say?  We finished off our visit with the Cheesecake which was by far again...AMAZING!  I've been here several times and had several different apps, entrees, drinks and desserts and have NEVER been disappointed!  I can't wait to go back... TROY was our server tonight and he was fantastic by the way!  He put up with our questions and checked in on us at every point through our dining experience!  I can't wait to go back there and I really hope you give it a try!  You will love it as much as I do!  Thanks again to Troy who really went above and beyond just to be nice and normal tonight!!!!!! :-) .   #LOVETHECREEK"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE DINNER SPECIALS! Been burned more than once on them. Burgers and wings are about it here! Ticket times are slow. The wait staff is very friendly...."}
{"text":"The Creek is one of my favorite places to dine it has a great staff to go along with it's fantastic food, I have eaten there several times & never been disappointed, also taken friends here & without asking them they give it a thumbs up   large parking lot. large seating area, very nice patio, Their happy hour is GREAT !! In my opinion one of the best burgers in N. Scottsdale / Cave Creek area. Everyone should give it try."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service at the bar was great! just a bit weird of a layout at bar by the group table over looking forno oven! Nice surprise tho!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant but freezing in here today, no excuse for it to be so cold.  Food was ice cold in seconds.  Wait person non-existent, need more help when they are busy."}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered the Mussels in Red Sauce special. A light, brothy red sauce, tasty, but VERY salty. Needed to ask for a spoon to scoop the mussels and sauce and a plate to discard shells.
The pepperoni and sausage pizza was very good. Sauce was flavorful and the dough cooked perfectly.
We liked that there is a wall separating an area with tv's to watch sports, great idea. We'll have to come watch a game! Music is just loud enough that your conversation is private and you don't have to yell to be heard. 
Our waitress, Natalie, was friendly and helpful. But seemed to be busy training another waitress.
We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A welcome replacement to the Mexican place I never went to that replaced CocomoJoes.  Nice modern redo to the inside with big granite top bar.  I sat at bar. Real deal pizza oven situated in the center. The food was decent. Bang Bang Shrimp was good and $2 off happy.  The 4 cheese pizza was decent. A little on the garlic side. The BLT was a disaster. The bacon was cold and it's a club sandwich. Not as advertised. The bar tender seemed overwhelmed. The couple next to me had raw chicken the bar tender apologized for. Anyway needs some improvement, but nice remodel."}
{"text":"Amazing place the food,the atmosphere and our server Kia. It was a little busy but we got a table within 10mins and our server Kia was welcoming and helped out on what was delicious ( everything) but we got a pizza and prime rib dip and they were amazing. We also had a delicious bread pudding. Thank you again Kia for such wonderful and warm service! We will be making this spot a regular spot!"}
{"text":"A friend just referred me to the Creek Patio Grill and I found a new favorite place!  Their drinks are wonderful. The filet mignon bites with Bernaise sauce were wonderful and I am madly in love with their lamb chop appetizer. Happy hour saves $2 off of many regular prices.  Our waiter, Andrew, was very helpful.   I highly recommend the Creek Patio Grill.  P.S.  They now have chocolate malts."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area from the start and it keeps getting better. The staff is friendly and the food is way above par. Not your normal bar food menu. Its a Bar and a Restaurant. From Wings to Burgers to Steaks. We love the happy hour and it goes till 7PM the filet bites are awesome and the Spinach Dip is very good and a bit different and served in a mini Skillet which is a nice touch. The Dry rub wings are a nice twist from the standard Hot wings, try em you might just switch...."}
{"text":"First visit here and I hope to make this a habit. The Margherita Pizza was really yummy, as was the Frozen half Sangria half Bellini! Definitely will return and try some other things!"}
{"text":"Have been ready to welcome back a real bar and grill to this location and the Creek is a much better manifestation of the spirit of Cocomo Joes that we've been missing for so long! Brick oven pizza and burgers are great. Wings were ok. Good beer selection and good happy hour. New patio is great. Now all we need is some live entertainment (get the Crown Kings please!) and we'll be back in business to fill a niche gap for this dead zone between desert ridge and cave creek town."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. We recently moved to the neighborhood and fell in love with this place. The food is great, a bit pricey but worth it in my opinion. The staff is extremely friendly and personable which my husband and I LOVE. They definitely make you feel like you're at home here. We always sit at the bar, the bartenders are great. The only downfall is they don't have a wide variety of craft beers on draft. We recommend this place to everyone we know. We love it and will be back again... and again...and again."}
{"text":"Finally we get a great restaurant in the neighborhood!!  It's tough to find a good place to eat and hangout being so north of Desert Ridge but not anymore.  I popped in to check it out and was really impressed.  I sat at the bar and met Chris the bartender, super nice guy. He and his partner Cathy are so friendly and helpful.  I ordered a pizza and was very good, fair price and very delicious.  I've become somewhat of a regular and have worked my way through most of the menu.  From pizza and wings to lamb chops, burgers, salads, salmon and more they have it all.  The food and service are superb, I HIGHLY suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"This location finally got it right. After being Kokomo Joe's and a nondescript Mexican restaurant it is now the creek patio grill. Fantastic food excellent happy hour and great staff. I hope this lasts."}
{"text":"Love this place. We've been about 5 times and every time has been great. $5 house wine everyday, what more could you ask for? We get the coconut chicken skewers and have had the wood fire pizza. They've been very good. Happy this place came to open in our area."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first experience here! The staff was extremely attentive. Anna, Our server was just delightful. Hope we get her again. We did Happy Hour....great deals. Highly recommend the lamb chops! Absolutely fabulous! The Filet Mignon bites were tremendously tasty! And to top it off both managers checked in us twice to make sure we were happy. Were sold! Bought gift cards to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Didn't feel bad and didn't feel good either... Ordered three share plates, Wings, Lamb chops and pork ribs. Lamb tastes the best and it also costs the best. Both wings and ribs are too saucy. Creek dry rub has got too much salt on and honey bbq has got too much bbq sauce as well...

Forgot to mention, another thing we like is they get out food really fast!"}
{"text":"We thought we made a mistake by waiting until 11/30/16 to use our special coupon (that expired on 11/30.)  The place was packed, with everyone taking advantage of their coupon which could have been used throughout November.  We almost left without trying to get a seat, but then saw two places as the bar.  So glad we persevered!
Chris, the bartender, who is always friendly and efficient, did not fail us this time either.  He was juggling numerous patrons' orders, but he still took our order and got our drinks quickly.  Once the food was ready he served it up, piping hot (we both had pizzas) and made sure we had water in addition to our wine.  
They have a special pizza oven, which must be why their pizza dough tastes so good!  Loved the meal, the service and the discount!"}
{"text":"Look out for the smell of nasty when you walk in-it smells like hot sewer water. 

We went on a Saturday afternoon-I got the \"Fast Food Burger\" and hubs got the \"Spicy Chicken Sandwich\". We cut our sandwiches in half so we could both try both. The burger was a win, two four ounce patties and very tasty. The chicken was also tasty, but very, very messy. They also put the end \"stump\" of tomato on the chicken sandwich, not very appetizing. No one wants that piece (they replaced it, along with our empty ketchup). I thought the fries were over salted, but tasty. Our table was sticky, but it was cleaned right after we mentioned it. The only part we did not love was the pizza boxes stacked all around the pizza oven, it was pretty tacky. It was quiet and mostly silver surfers for clientele. We will go again-assuming that they will correct the odor coming from (I assume) the bar sink area before we go back."}
{"text":"Three generations of my family meet here for dinner energy Fri. They continue to improve their food quality and service.  Good pizza and great lamb chops."}
{"text":"A great gem of a local casual dining place with enough TV's to qualify, IMO, as an upscale sports bar. The main restaurant is away from the TVs, in case you are just there for a meal. The food is good - my wife and I were in for an in-between meal last Saturday, ordered pretzel bites - very good. Then we split a cesar wrap and sweet potato fries, again, very good. 
They have a nice cross-section of wines and a great beer selection, as well as a full bar. Happy hour is 7 days a week!
Our server was right on point, very attentive without being intrusive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"They have got to get a drink in your hand or at least be greeted at a table in the bar area quickly.  We have had hit or miss service. Tonight I watched two people leave but everyone else seemed to be good.  The gal walking around should greet every table and see how things are going twice per table.  Saw her at first then not again. Please step up and get the service level up.  It is not even the season so you should be able to take care of every guest.  My guess is that these are not experienced wait staff."}
{"text":"Love this place however way too many dishes involving fish/seafood. Need some basic menu items such as: taco salad, Ruben (Pastrami Ruben would be great), taco chip platter, loaded potato skins. People do not want to go next-door to noisy sports bar would like some of these foods but are forced to go elsewhere. A few added items to this menu would be wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great menu and location. Anything from salads or burgers to filet bits. Good bar area with TV's and any beer or drink you want."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a neighborhood spot with good food and an owner who is on site. We had the spare rib special AND it was special. A lot for $21.00 with roasted asparagus and garlic mashed  potatoes. Mike stopped by our table and we talked. Not just a passing manager. Know what I mean?
This place has been opened for 3 months but I think it will only get better. If noise is an issue (music can be loud) just  sit at the bar in front of the chalk board bar MENU. 
The patio will be a big hit after our summer heat. Beautiful water fall."}
{"text":"California roll on POINT! Even better when they're on happy hour! I've had their pizza, a few of their sandwiches and a burger here and everything has always been SO good. Their French Fries are thin and crispy and even their ranch doesn't taste like Hidden Valley junk. Our last server was a blonde woman and I can't recall her name for the life of me but she was so sweet and made our experience this last time so wonderful! She needs a high five because I love a great server. You'll never leave hungry and their menu is perfect with anything you can ask for."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 4 star because it's a local place to me and I want them to succeed.   Great food, but the selection is very limited, that's why I can't give them 5 stars.  Looks like it's catered to old people or amateur chefs because they have simple things and not anything with flavor.  I've been here a few times and will come again.  The pizza is really good, but it's hard to mess that one up when they have a brick oven.  I did get lucky once and ordered there halibut when they had it on special, but another time they ran out.  They used to have mussels as an appetizer, but took that off the menu.  Maybe one day they'll expand the menu and have a better selection.  The fillet I ordered another time was a little over cooked but still tasted great because it's a fillet.  Spinach artichoke dip is probably the best appetizer they have available.  For dessert, creme brûlée and the bread pudding are really good and a must if you're craving sweets after your meal.  The service is excellent.  Chase, like the bank, is by far the best waiter I've come across, so ask to be seated in his section if he's available."}
{"text":"This place has such potential. The people in this area are dying for a GREAT place to go and meet and have fun. 

I have stopped by 3 times around happy hour after work and I have to tell you that if you are looking for a place with incredibly rude and inattentive staff then this is your spot. The bartenders are too busy cleaning barware to pay any attention to the customers. Let me tell you that if a place is packed 2 deep I get it but the 3 times I've been in, about half of the barstools were occupied. No excuse...

Too bad, because I and many others were looking for a happy hour spot in this area."}
{"text":"Used to eat there ALL THE TIME (SEVERAL times a week)..not sure what's going on now, however had 2 meals recently that were NOT good. Ordered a plain pizza..meh..then ordered a burger..had a couple of lumps of grizzle or God knows what in the middle of the burger..GROSS! Don't want to eat a burger for a good long time after that. Did I say GROSS!  Went to ladies room and walked past grungy/disorganized kitchen area --bathroom was barely passable in cleanliness. It must be getting too busy and owner is not there enough to watch what is going on. Really disappointed!!"}
{"text":"First time here with recommendations from work colleagues. Loved the place. Great happy hour. Very good service (thank you Tyler) loved all 3 small plates that we shared. Nice patio. We will be back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time patron today. I was planning to go to Tailgaters today for a late lunch/happy hour. When I got to Tailgaters, 1) it smelled like a public restroom. 2) I sat down for nearly 20 minutes and was never served a menu, beer, or food. So I walked out, and on a hunch I went to The Creek. 

This place was incredible; the people were nice, beer was cold, food was hot (and came out really fast!), and the atmosphere was awesome. 

10/10 would recommend (eating on the patio was great!)"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this great restaurant and have NEVER been disappointed. Hands on management of delightful servers (hey Sara) and bar staff (hey Chris) makes this place awesome!  The food is delicious, consistent,hot and has great plate appeal. Everything is great so it is hard to recommend specifically. My favs are: bang bang shrimp, veal meatball sliders, filet bites, prime rib sandwich, and more (all)  Great happy hour 4-7, open for lunch. This month has seen a few new additions to the menu..creme brulee...yum, and the best bread pudding in town is still listed.  If you havent been here you are missing out on one of the best restaurants in the area....(keep an eye out for the best ice cream in town to be here soon).....love this place!"}
{"text":"What a great spot in an area of the valley not known for having more than chain options. We went in on a Friday night -- it was busy -- but we still didn't have to wait very long for our party of 12 to be seated. The waitress was definitely overwhelmed by the size of our group but the service wasn't slow by any means. I had the grilled salmon salad and it was perfect. The hubs had something of a beef, dippish, sandwichy variety and he was happy. The child had the uber exotic butter noodles. Its a very cool atmosphere -- child friendly but more of an upscale feel which has been lacking in this part of Phoenix. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went to the Creek for brunch, the bartenders Danielle and Billy \"McLovin\", were great!! 
loved the Bottomless Mimosas!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite neighborhood place near Tatum and Dynamite.  I love to sit at the bar with my girlfriend.  Chris is an absolutely wonderful bartender.  He is the bald guy. You can't miss him! He is super attentive and after a few visits he will greet by name AND know your drink!
There is also \"Dilly Billy\" and Danielle.  They are all awesome. If you come for Friday happy hour....get there ealy to get a seat at the bar! I think it's Wednesday that is 1/2 price bottles of wine. 
The food is awesome.  Try the steak bites! If your really hungry try the Fork and Knife burger.  
Give this place a try and say hi to Chris!"}
{"text":"So grateful to have a delicious place to go in Cave Creek. Family friendly, great atmosphere. Frozen Sangria is out of this world delicious. Bang bang shrimp is not to be missed. Give it a try, delicious food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Great place for watching sports with TV's everywhere. The TV's are not the best part though. If you are looking for great food with reasonable prices this is the place. We primarily go on Sundays for brunch. Great menu with Bloody Mary and Champagne specials. The staff is friendly and provide great service. Austin and his team have something really good going on. Stop in sometime."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks.  Wow - so excited to have a such a great restaurant in my area.  I was blown away by the portions that they serve - and the quality of the food they are serving.  The only reason for a 4 star vs. a 5 is that the service (although my server was super nice) was just a bit on the slow side.  Other than that, no complaints at all.  Really can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So so restaurant. The menu is straightforward but the food tends to lack seasoning. It's probably a good place for families and those looking for a quick and easy meal but not a place I would recommend or return to."}
{"text":"Good feeling place! Food was fresh and top shelf! Bar Staff were friendly and helpful. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and each visit has been great. The crew, the food, the drinks and ambiance are all on point. We've dined at a table and we've also dined at the bar, both provided a fantastic time. 
I have one small gripe, and trust me it's small... The hubby and I came in and sat at the bar on a Sunday night. It was pretty mellow over all and the music seemed extremely low. The manager mentioned she had a guest complain and asked for it to be lowered. I get that, I too am a restaurant manager and I get complaints about our music too, however, it gets to a point where you need to ask yourself if you're better off pleasing one, or pleasing the masses? Music is a HUGE part of a restaurant/bar ambiance, it adds an added pleasure that MOST guest sppteciate. My husband and I really enjoy coming here, we will be back, with or without the music..."}
{"text":"The creek restaurant was a delight for our date night dinner. Beautiful inside. Busy bar area and too many TVs in my opinion but otherwise very pretty.
Looks like they can accommodate large parties and family dining also.
I was in the mood for the grilled mahi mahi sandwich with shoe string fries. Very tasty!! The fries shine here with the perfect amount of seasoning.
Hubby had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and really enjoyed it. 
Prices were reasonable and service was great! 
We would definitely dine here again.
Ps. The burgers looked really good so I know what I will have next time!"}
{"text":"Had a great time.the atmosphere is very nice the food was excellent and our server Kaleigh was knowledgeable and friendly!!! We'll definitely be back to see her and for more delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! So glad we finally have a good Neibor hood place to come enjoy. I had the shrimp and it was great. I think I found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"What it should be: Bring back the live 80s-90s music so the 35-55 year old crowd can drink, dance and keep the rumor mill churning in Cave Creek. Appetizers would be nice, but I doubt many people ever went there for the food. 

What it was: Cocomo's? See Above, but add cheese. Asados? Puhleeeze.....ugh.

What it seems to be now: It's much cleaner, has an updated interior and the menu now looks like a nicer neighborhood pub. After all, if you want Mexican, there are SEVERAL better places around (Spotted Donkey, Encanto, Valle Luna, Etc...). The current menu is better. The new patio area is OK, but maybe when it cools they can open it up more. The employees are nice and the drinks are pretty reasonable.

So, if they could open it up just a bit and bring back live music, I really think they'd hold a solid spot as a local weekend night option. It's closer to home and you always know someone (for better or worse). The food is better, but unless the douche with the frosted tips (Guy F?) or Gordon Ramsay come in (damn, that would be entertaining) then the food will probably never be the headline here, no matter what name is on the building that month."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, especially when the doors are all open. Good views of the TV's from the bar also. Happy hour food is great, haven't had anything bad yet! Drink menu is very craft yet easy to relate to. Presentation and recipes are on point. Danielle is one of our favorites and will always recommend."}
{"text":"We tried this spot the other night, and it was very good! This is walkable from our house and has a great shaded patio area. For starters, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  This was good, but I was surprised when I tasted no bacon as the menu listed it was supposed to have. Additionally,  we had to ask for extra chips because the portion didn't match the amount of dip we were given. But they gave us chips at no charge, which was nice! 

We each ordered a Moscow mule-they have a bunch of cocktail drinks on their menu and they were delicious! We also each had a beer. They have great craft beer selections-both local and not. 

For the main course, I ordered the white pizza. It was good, but a little heavy on the ricotta cheese. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips with fries-it was SO good. 

For one appetizer, two meals, and four drinks, we paid about 60 dollars. Not too bad of a price! We will definitely be back to try more menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Rude owner, disgusting, overpriced food which made me ill. I saw employees leave the restroom without washing their hands. Avoid at all costs. This place is poorly managed and is destined to fail. I only hope that the number of food poisoning victims is not too high."}
{"text":"Food was good. The bartender on the other hand, was the worlds worst bartender.  There were maybe 8 people at the bar on Sunday afternoon, and he insisted on finishing his story about Halloween to one of his regular customers. It's was impossible to get his attention. Once we finally had it, he was very passive aggressive. 
   The bartender clearly has a problem. If another patron on the other side of the bar has to say, \" hey bartender, can we get another drink?  What, is this the prohibition?\"  Lol. That comment was the highlight of our time at the creek.  All in all. Place is great. Hope they hire a different dude to run the bar. P.s. keep an eye on rim of your wine glass, the wine glasses hang just low enough in order for the bartenders head to graze the rims of all the wine glasses hanging to dry."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The pizza has always been good and the prices are ok. Their HH prices are also good.  Unfortunately cannot give high marks for their wait staff. They can be quite rude if you don't kiss their a**. If you only want to have drinks at a table and decide not to order food they get quite snippy and terse toward you which is not the way to treat paying customers.  They forget that we are the ones who paying them to work not the other way around. If there are no customers then they do not have a job.This restaurant should pay more attention to how their staff treats their customers.  The Bar staff is usually very attentive and friendly, it is the staff that waits the tables outside and away from the bar."}
{"text":"Great service! Yes it just opened and they are going overboard to make 
people smile. The food was good and the drinks were cold. I had a Margarita Pizza
it was served piping hot and with fresh basil. Try the homemade bread pudding, it is large enough  for two! I will be returning for Happy Hour.

."}
{"text":"First time there, they've been open since April or May??  Much bigger on the inside than I remember from Cocomo Joe's when it was there.  Excellent food!  Fast and very friendly service.  The waitress gave some good suggestions; took her up on the Oriental Chicken salad with the Thai peanut dressing, YUMMY!!  Not too busy when we got there about 4:45PM but by the time we left about an hour later, it was filling up quickly.  Definitely will be going back again!  Nice to have somewhere with good food, very reasonable prices and friendly service right in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here so far has been amazing! 

Spinach artichoke dip: creamy, cheesy, and toasted on the top. 

Pizza: pepperoni pizza is on happy hour and you will not regret ordering it! Dough is fluffy, sauce is flavorful. 


Chicken club: Panko crusted chicken, an absolute delight and one of the few places I've found with the correct chicken/breading ratio. And yes the bacon is CRISPY. 


Coconut Chicken: These are my absolute favorite and will order them again and again. Chicken was so tender, flavor and breaking was perfect once again. 

The ambience is relaxing, although some light music would have been nice. The servers are all attentive and provided great suggestions. Completely satisfied and delighted with my visit and look forward to trying other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Gets pretty busy during happy hour, but no wait for the dining room (where happy hour specials are still available). Tried the fish special, as well as their standard fish entree and some burgers--all delicious."}
{"text":"The service was awful!  Let me restate, servers were nice but had 3 orders wrong , never gave one person food, came back twice to ask how things were and were told that they had three orders wrong , and never got one.  Finally brought last order, never asked people until everyone was done eating if they wanted another drink, and never offered to take one meal off to make things right for a party that was very large.  Food was decent but this restaurant would never survive in Chicago with that kind of management or service...."}
{"text":"Excellent from the get-go. Bartender never missed a beat as we waited for our table....which wasn't long at all on this busy Saturday night. Patio seating was great with heaters on a beautiful, yet cooler night. Server was great.....food was, too (lettuce wraps, California rolls and Kung Pao shrimp)....followed up with Creme Brûlée = delicious. A 'must try'.... worth the drive."}
{"text":"Happening place for a beautiful Friday night.  I sat at the bar and was warmly greeted by several bartenders.  The happy hour is reasonable and I tried the bang bang shrimp.  More tempura than I like but very tasty and large shrimp.   Ready for another trip back, pizza was highly recommended will give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service...beautiful restaurant!!!! New GM -- Austin; absolute pro!!!! We'll be back often!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come down for an evening alone. Such a great atmosphere, AMAZING bartender (Chris), great drinks and delicious bang bang shrimp!!!!"}
{"text":"Crappy beer menu. Very generic food menu. Food was just okay. The fries are good. Not many options if you don't eat red meat or pork."}
{"text":"Loved the appetizer and mixed drinks here!!

Lamb chop appetizer (5/5) 3 perfectly cooked lamb chops with mobgolian glaze and awesome lightly curry flavor sauce on side -- so happy we ordered two my VERY finicky 9yr old niece k9ved it and ate 1.5 of chops

Bang Bang Shrimp (5/5) - large shrimp fluffy light batter with yummy sweet spicy aioli sauce (hint of siracha love) the coleslaw at the bottom was a nice accompaniment 

Pizza (4/5) - crust was great fire grilled,  but wish they had better cheeses in it 

Happy Hour 3-7pm , $1 off drafts, $2 off mixed drinks n wine, $ 2 off shared plates.

Honey Dee (5/5) - vodka with grapefruit juice , grapefruit liquor, honey syrup, lemon juice.. soooo good one if the best mixed drink I've had not too sweet but fruity enough that the alcohol content was deceiving

Copper Creek (4/5) - a version of moscow mule using pineapple vodka, ginger beer, simple syrup, and basil leaf muddled in.. the basil leaf was a bit too strong for me but loved it came in a copper martini glass.. refreshing but wouls have preferred mint over basil

Service (3/5) -
Would have given it a 5/5 but the outside service we had wad nice but SLOW!!!  She got our food but didnt come back to check on us.  So had to flag her down.  Everyone else including the floor manager bus table were prompt and fast i think it was just our waitress was slow.

Great outside patio with heat lamps very relaxing,  bring your pup!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place since it's so close to my house, but it hasn't lived up to my expectations so far. The decor is odd and the restaurant feels dark and old. The food was decent, as was the service (both times we have been). Perhaps next time we will try the patio."}
{"text":"We love the creek !! We go there pretty often !! They have a pretty good menu and my kids love their pizza. They also have pretty awesome buffets for Mother's Day and other holidays check it out if your ever in cave creek !!"}
{"text":"I don't even like to get up on Sunday morning, let alone cook breakfast so we decided to do brunch at the Creek. The food came quickly and my only complaint about my meal was that I couldn't finish it. I ordered the short ribs which came on top of potatoes with two perfectly fried eggs on top. Breaking those yokes and eating them as they covered my potatoes felt decadent. My husband just devoured his chicken and waffles. And, of course, there was the Mimosas.  The portion I took home was enough for lunch the next day with enough left over to make Wonderdawg very happy!  We go to this restaurant regularly and while I have never had any issues with the food, we did have one dinner where service seemed lackadaisical. Not on this morning! Our server was unobtrusively attentive and it was the perfect way to start off a day."}
{"text":"First timers, this place was very nicely redone from the last restaurant that was in this location. The brick oven pizza was very good and the spinach dip was really good quality and fresh. Had a good time we will definitely be returning again"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times because some friends of ours like the place.  We have never had a decent meal here.  Last night we stopped by on the way home after a show to have a drink, sat there for about 10 minutes and were never waited on.  I will never go here again, mediocre food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"I struggled between a 3 and 4 star rating here. I had 2 glasses of house Pinot Noir- they have amazing pours! And at $5 a glass, it's a score every time! They also offer $2 off cocktails, $1 off draft and bottled beer during happy hour, along with $8 margarita and pepperoni pizzas and $2 off shared plates. I went for the bang bang shrimp due to prior reviews and the bartenders recommendation. It didn't disappoint- 8 full-sized fried shrimp with a dynamite sauce on a bed of slaw. The flavors paired really well, and the slaw did a great job of toning down the heat of the sauce over the shrimp. I would order again- $11 reg, $9 on HH. Several people also ordered the lamp chop shared plate, and it looked delicious. The scene is definitely an older crowd.. I'd say 50-70 years old on avg at the bar. Happy hour is incredible busy, so don't plan for a large crew at the bar."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with this place. The Bang Bang shrimp was amazing, it's a nice atmosphere and good pricing and we all enjoyed our food. They told us about their brunch menu they have on Sundays and it looks amazing, we look forward to checking it out as well."}
{"text":"Great food, Chris is such a friendly bartender, Michelle a wonderful server... Jay Allan playing some great tunes! Really, really great food!"}
{"text":"Joined a friend tonight for a wonderful meal. The Creek did not disappoint. Our server, Ellen was knowledgeable with her suggestions and very friendly. She suggested the bang-bang shrimp, filet bites and caprese salad. Rather than have us over-order she said it was a nice display of items off the menu. I will be back and ask for Ellen again. She made my experience a 5 star."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with a great patio with plenty of shade. The food is delicious. Our company tried the appez bang bang shrimp & coconut chicken & the main course were pizza, steak, & beef dip. We all enjoyed our meals. We recommend trying this place, & we will be returning. :-)"}
{"text":"Comfortable, fun restaurant with a good vibe. Been here twice, pleased both times. Last visit shared bang bang shrimp and artichoke pizza  - both great - way more than enough for two. Eager to go back and enjoy the outdoor seating when it's a bit warmer!"}
{"text":"If you call yourself a wine bar, and I can get everything at the local supermarket........hmmm . Service ok, but not very thoughtful/ well trained...average. Bang bang shrimp and spinach dip fairly  good. 80+ items on the menu seems unwieldy.  A convenient local pub but dont drive out of your way."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about three times now and every time it has been great, I especially like the grilled mahi sandwich,we had Keri as our waitress and she is outstanding. My husband had pizza and there was nothing left on his plate so thumbs up for that. Finally a neighborhood spot for us to frequent...YAY!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was five stars from the service to the food. Seriously, every employee we came into contact with was excellent. The restaurant is beautiful and pretty decent pricing for how good the food is! The coconut chicken was my favorite! My boyfriend and I had never heard of this place, but we're always up for a nice patio. So happy we decided to try The Creek out because we were very impressed! Definitely worth the drive if you're not around that area!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Service was good and it was nice inside. The problem I had was with the food I selected. I got the \"big bowl of mac and cheese\" 1. It was not a big bowl and 2. It must of been box mac and cheese did not taste homemade I actually thought the box Velveeta tastes better then this. Probably won't return based off my bad food experience."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood place. The food was delish.  We had the bang bang shrimp, pretzel bites and coconut chicken.  All was amazing and the portion sizes are large. Ice cold beers and great people. Ellen is friendly. Great outdoor patio!!"}
{"text":"Very good. Very tasty and not to expensive.  The food presentation is Chef Professional. Somebody in the kitchen knows how to cook and look pleasing...well done."}
{"text":"went to here for dinner by the suggestion of my mother, over all I was pleasantly surprised, they have a very good variety of dishes, and were very reasonably priced. Our server Debanjali  \"DJ\" was the best server I have had at any in a long time. She had a great smile a great attitude, and was very attentive to our table.  Hats off to her.     All the food we had was very flavorful.   the pizza had plenty of toppings on it, and for $11 was reasonable priced,   the Fettucine alfredo was made just right,   I had the goat cheese burger with cheddar instead of goat cheese, cause I wanted the other topping it has, and the secret sauce was yummy,  the only compliant I had was, the bread was heavy and doughy, and needed to be toasted.   but I still want to go back again."}
{"text":"First time there last night celebrating a girlfriend's birthday all I have to say is wow. The place looks absolutely amazing love how they've redone it compared to when it was Cocomo Joe's. Great food I had a little filet steak bites amazing. Wait staff was great very attentive. I will definitely be coming back I think I found a new hangout"}
{"text":"We were introduced to the Creek by friends and it has become one of our local favorites. Everything I've tried has be very good. Like everyone else the Bang Bang Shrimp is our favorite. Salads, entry, burgers and sandwiches are all good. 
Try it...you'll like it."}
{"text":"This was our THIRD visit to the Creek Patio Grill and what a disappointment!!! We arrived around 5 pm on Sunday (today) and chose to sit on the patio...opposite the patio to the Tailgator's Sports Bar (which had a \"soft\" opening). 
The only table available on the patio still had all the dishes and cutlery from the previous customers. We sat down and waited 10 mins for the bus boy to clear the table. Our waitress promptly came and took our food and drink order.  Very disappointing was the fact that we waited about 30 mins for  1/3 of our food order to arrive. Our pizza was delivered by  the manager, Sherry.  The pizza was cold.  When we told this to our waitress, she had no idea how to solve the problem.  We asked for the manager, Sherry who eventually made her way to our table and removed the cold pizza and said she would have another made.  We then decided to tell her (Sherry) that we had also ordered some sweet potato fries and a wedge salad.  The salad arrived 10 mins later.  The new pizza 20 mins later and then our lovely \"luke warm\" burnt sweet potato fries arrived.  Another 30 mins into our meal another manager named Austin hurriedly swept by asking if everything was okay.
All the while, we were subject to listening to obnoxiously loud music provided by the Tailgator's from next door, making it difficult to hold a decent conversation.  At no time did the manager, Sherry stop to ask us how every was, despite her  walking  by us 11 times since she dropped the pizza the second time.
Then we paid our bill and had to wait another 10 mins before the waitress returned with our credit card and receipt.
This is NO way to treat your customers. Sherry, who did not look presentable as a manager, appeared to be no match for keeping her wait staff on their toes, and appeared to lack the knowledge of connecting with her customers who encountered a problem with the food.
We will not be back in a hurry after this rather disappointing visit today......"}
{"text":"Been here a lot since my review, great place to come now & would encourage more locals to come on in!"}
{"text":"The burger we got was delicious, but the service was horrible.  Hostess didn't smile or seem very unpleased to be at work. Was seated and no one came to our table for 10 minuets. Waitress saw us for about 45 seconds as if she was in a hurry to be somewhere else. She didn't even bring us our food. We came in on a Sunday afternoon, wasn't even busy so I don't understand where she kept disappearing too."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, wine, food is always amazing. My children always ask me to go here.  Super kid friendly, great patio and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the service and food never disappoint! The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. We had an event there recently where we had a private room and preset menu. The general manager Austin was great to work with while planning and vet accommodating! Our server Larry was great, he was friendly, fun, helpful and provided quick service. The hostess was also very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place to anyone whether it be an event or just a dinner or happy hour."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 4, but the staff is inexperienced and understaffed during rush hours.  A great Happy Hour menu and very popular with the locals."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time tonight at the creek two year anniversary party, where they discounted drinks and appetizers for 2 days for anyone who wanders in, but also those customers on their email list. I ordered a lettuce wrap appetizer and a cocktail, my dining companion had a fast food style double cheese burger. Total bill $20. Everything was presented in a lovely way and was fresh and tasty. I saw a gorgeous coconut chicken skewer appetizer go by with standing skewers!  Our server was super friendly, but our orders were not entirely accurate.  All in all a good experience though!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we found this place at the end of our winter stay. We've eaten at probably most of the restaurants in north Scottsdale, and we think this is one of the best values around for dinner. A large selection, especially for happy hour, which extends to 7 pm. The pizza is great, salads also a highlight, bang bang shrimp were also good. The service was prompt and attentive. It's a very large place with outside seating as well. We don't give out 5 stars very often, but this restaurant deserves it."}
{"text":"Worst BLT I have ever been served in a restaurant. There was only 1 1/2 pieces of bacon on my BLT. No one came by to ask us how our food was, now I know why.. they don't want too.  Probably had to many complaints already"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Super yummy food. I got the blackened mahi-mahi  and my wife got the woodfired spinach artichoke pizza. Come check it out! If I could make the six stars I would after having the brownie and ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"nice ambiance. my husband had the lamb chops which he enjoyed but the twice backed potatoe was just blah and lacked seasoning. we ordered the children's cheese pizza,which was a good portion, for our 2 year old. I have the frozen sangria- Very good! I ordered the Hawaii chicken sandwhich with sweet potato fries. sandwhich was messy but tasty. fries very also very good. we got the bread pudding dessert which was excellent.
ONE HUGE ISSUE I HAD THOUGH WAS NO CHANGING TABLE IN THE RESTROOM!!!. PLEASE CONSIDER CHANGING THIS"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. Must try their pizza. You wouldn't expect it but they have a brick oven and their pizzas are to die for. This place is simply amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend.

Came on a Friday night just after prime time. Busy but immediate seating. Nice, friendly staff. Clean place.

Tried their \"Creek Burger.\" It tasted great. Great char on the 3 burger patties. Good condiments and tasty cheese melted all over everything. Was not equally impressed with the chicken parm sandwich. Why they call their fries \"shoe string\" is beyond me - they are pretty regular and tasted fine.

Had their chocolate brownie for dessert. Very good.

Excellent portion sizes for the prices."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant again within walking distance of the house...so we walked over to give it a try. Looks great!!! Hostess was friendly upon entering and decor looks great. We went to get seated and staff as we passed through restaurant did not seem very happy and the ones we passed by did not greet or make eye contact...i found this to be a little off putting. Waitress was friendly, but had an overwhelming smell of cigarettes that wasn't the best for us. We ordered quickly and was accommodated nicely, and with 4 kids this is helpful. Lighting was nice and music was perfect and not too loud. Food came in good time and one pizza was wrong and servers didn't know what burger has sauce on it. Food was fixed and kids are happy...burgers were very good and i love crunchy fries, so the shoestring fries were perfect. All in all mot bad, but with the price point the staff is going to have to pick up there game and water at table should be filtered better, too close to tap water."}
{"text":"I am new to the Neighborhood and had no idea they were also. I was welcomed by the owner  who stopped by and said hello upon arriving and seated. The service was superb! I went out on a limb and tried the Lamb chop entree and was REALLY glad I did! The lamb chop entree was very tasty, cooked perfectly and 5 star quality. I had many patrons notice my selection and ask me how it was. I gave a thumbs up to all! I am happy to find this in Cave Creek!  Prices were great and so was the wine list. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Went to the creek patio grill last night! It was amazing! My parents drove up from Tucson and enjoyed it as well! The food, service and atmosphere was great! The chef came to our table and was very attentive, informative and asked how everything was? The owners were equally as accommodative! I would definitely recommend this place. It was packed and yet the chef, owners, server were very friendly! Plan on eating there often. Rhonda Ross"}
{"text":"The best!!!! Food is excellent and the service is great! HAPPY hour is a must. Mike and Jeanine are very cordial and make you feel at home. Just had birthday party there and is was flawless. Everyone that was there(40people) were blown away . Refreshing change from most of restaurants in the area.. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was hoping it was good-we were not disappointed!  Larry Legend was our server and was very attentive: our party of 6 were all satisfied and very pleased with their selections.  The RibEye steak salad, Lamb Chops, Filet Oscar and The Creek burger were all smart choices!  Happy hour 3-7pm EVERY day. Can't beat that. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant ten stars! I had a fabulous dining experience here tonight. I had true Maryland style crab cakes with lumps of crab meat. I tried  the special which was baked halibut served over bokchoy. The entire meal was beyond words. It was truly fabulous. The server Thomas was superb. Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"The Creek has evolved from the infamous Coco Mo Joes which started out on a high note so many years ago then turned into a disaster of Mexican cuisine then once again transformed into today's The Creek. The 'WiseGuy Eats' food blog where only the ponies run in your town tried The Creek and found a rebirth of exceptional greatness worthy of 4.5 ponies. The service by Sarah was outstanding. The 10 dollar tip was easy to hand out. This month's reload of the website will feature The Creek. Try the Bang Bang shrimp or the Coconut Chicken. You'll leave with a smile and a few bucks in your wallet. Can't wait to go back when Turf Paradise starts running again in October. Eats are what we do, The WiseGuy."}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday for lunch.

First the good:. No evidence of the bad smell commented on by earlier postings.  In fact place seemed quite clean and even a bit bleach-y smelling.

Sat at the bar which wasn't busy and got prompt service.  $5 house wine was actually OK.

I Ordered the grilled fish sandwich with sweet potato fry upgrade.  Hubs got BBQ chicken pizza.  Fish was cooked perfectly with tons of fresh spinach and a nice bun.  Pizza crust was excellent with nice chew and came with Gouda cheese which had a nice flavor.

The bad:. There was way too much of a way too sweet BBQ sauce on the pizza, not enough of the yummy Gouda, and the chicken tasted old and refrigerator-y.  There was also too much sauce on the sandwich.  The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy and could have used some sort of a spicy aioli or something.  Silver lining:. The too much BBQ sauce went OK with the fries so we scraped a bunch off the pizza for the fries.

Overall, not sure We'd return unless they up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Been here twice with kids everything is great from bang bang shrimp, pretzel bites, kids pizzas, chicken parmigiana sandwich.. onion rings are awesome.. wife just had halibut special and was also very good. Want to try brunch on Sunday. Best part is prices are fair for location and what u get! Will deff be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, service is good. They have a decent happy hour. Pretty overpriced. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. It's developed a nice little vibe of its own. The pizza is amazing. Bang bang shrimp are good- sometimes pretty spicy if you're up for it. Their French dip is okay a tad bland to be honest. Their sangria/Bellini mix blended drink is generally why I show up. The only thing I've walked away upset about are the wings but I can live with that. Never had a bad experience with the service everyone is awesome and happy to be there!"}
{"text":"Located northwest corner of Dynamite Blvd and Tatum Blvd. this is very unique restaurant. There is a huuuge wooden front door and large comfy private booths. 
Our waiter, Brandon was awesome. He gave us really good recommendations and it shows that he loved the food there and loved working there as well.
We ordered chicken wings, Bacon BBQ burger, spicy chicken sandwich and salmon salad. All were very tasty. They use the same buns for both the burgers and sandwiches. It's not your usual store bought buns either. It had sweet taste to it and tasted really light and paired nicely with both burgers and sandwiches. Everything was really tasty but if I'd have to pick, I liked their chicken sandwich the most. I'd love to try their pizzas next. Overall, very cozy restaurant with awesome food and service."}
{"text":"I'd give this joint 1.5 stars if possible because our server was pleasant and attentive.  We decided to sit at the bar on New Years Day for a beer and some lunch.  The restaurant was empty but the bar had about half the seats filled.  We were greeted by the bartender and put in an order for water and a beer.  A couple of minutes later, we were rewarded with the wrong drinks.  The bartender fixed his mistake with the water but completely blew off the beer.  We waited for 10 minutes but he spent the entire time talking to a customer with his back turned to us.  There were some tables that a young lady was serving so we moved to them.  Immediately, our service improved.  Sadly, the food was as horrible as our initial experience at the bar. 
   We started with their Kung Pao Fries.  The fry is a standard frozen shoestring product with what is undoubtedly a jarred soy based sauce.  It was an over seasoned mess.  Very disappointing.  We tried the pretzel bites but found they were frozen, tasted of freezer burn and inedible.  The kind young lady took them off our tab.  We had ordered an artichoke and spinach pizza with some extra items but they never made it to the party.  The best I can say about the pizza is that it was tolerable.  Bland, frozen skin, whole artichoke hearts straight from the can.  The pieces were way too big for pizza toppings.  What a disappointment.  This place is a stone's throw from our house.
   What's the deal with this building?   The food prepared here has always been of the frozen, low kitchen skill set variety no matter what the location has been called, Cocomo Joe's, The Creek or whatever that disgusting Mexican restaurant was named.   This could be a gold mine if an entrepreneur would put his heart and soul into product and service.  I'm sure it'll be available again soon as this place sucks.  Give us a solid bar with decent microbrew on tap.  Make some FRESH food and you'll have a winner.  It's possible but you'll need to care about what you serve and how you do it."}
{"text":"I'll be back, but there were a few small problems. The pretzel app was pretty good, although they don't make the pretzels. The kids cheese pizza was pretty good size and only $7.  The Hawaiian chicken sandwich was very messy- I wouldn't get it again due to the messy sauce - it was huge and good, though. The fries (regular) are similar to a fast food fry. The portobello sandwich was very good and the side salad was a good size. The one major bad was the buns on both sandwiches were burned and did taste pretty bad... I alerted the manager. The place was pretty packed by 6- but the noise wasn't terrible. Decor is nice and subtle. Menu has a lot of choices without being overwhelming. The happy hour menu looks pretty decent (3-7 every day).  Was less bar-like than I anticipated, which was good-- lots of families. We will be back."}
{"text":"I want to like this place I really do. Food isn't bad and I like the bar. Unfortunately the service has been and still is horrific. My daughter was in tonight we tried it again for a family dinner!  
Big mistake. Service was the worst ever and then the manager just made excuses   No apologies. No nothing.  Try a drink at the bar- but go in with the lowest service expectations- maybe you won't be disappointed then"}
{"text":"We've been coming to The Creek since the opening.  The food is fantastic, but what keeps us coming back is the stellar service.  Chris, Danielle and Billy provide great service and are one of the main reasons we keep coming back."}
{"text":"I still eat here and like it but am annoyed by all of the chores they give to bartenders.  Had lunch there this week and the bartender spend 95% of time moving dirty dishes, going to back storage room, cleaning floor, no time to pay attention to me--the customer...in the meantime I am seeing a lot of kitchen help standing around....it is the server job to wait on me NOT clean during business hours..setup should be done BEFORE you open!!!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about The Creek so I stopped in today for lunch.  IMO this particular spot has always been too large to try and make feel comfy, but they have made improvements from the last few restaurants in this spot. We were greeted right away and the service remained excellent throughout our meal. Their pizzas are supposed to be tasty, but I was in the mood for a BLT with a side salad. It was a generous size and came with a nice side salad that was quite lovely. My friend ordered the beef dip and loved it and she was able to take half of it home. The server offered us 'to go' glasses for our non alcohol drinks which is always appreciated. I will return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Food is great! Service amazing...BUT, unless you only want to listen to football, and not have a conversation do not come in Thursday. I love football, but prefer to watch when I am out and not listen. YIKES!"}
{"text":"At last a restaurant that deserves to succeed at this location! A nice room with table, booth, bar and patio seating. We were surprised at the variety on the menu. The pizza was above average and the fish and chips stood up to any around. The other customers weren't only there for dinner; there were several tables that were just there to have drinks and apps. This is the sort of place that is needed in this area, and it looks like we finally have one!  Sports friendly: lots of tv's but not in your face."}
