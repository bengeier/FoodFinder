{"text":"Wish I could rate this place twice. I'd give it two stars for lunch. Wasn't that impressed. Four stars for dinner. Fun atmosphere. Around five o clock is a good time to take kids for them to enjoy the dinner show."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  I hate to rag this place but...

The sushi is \"mall-quality.\"  It's not horrible, but it's just C-level fish.

The huge problem is the teppanyaki...just awful.  I ate there over the Christmas holidays.  I love this style of cooking and it's kinda hard to screw it up.  Here's how Kabuto managed:

-  The chicken was so salty it was inedible.  I ate 3 bites and had a headache for the rest of the evening (and I like a lot of salt and seasoning).

-  I also had a problem that neither the cook or the server questioned if there was a problem with the food since I hardly touched my chicken.  They probably didn't notice since...

-  The cook just GLOPS piles of noodles and rice on your plate (and on the table) like he was slopping hogs!  Only a 3 year old could be comfortable eating here.  Just crap.

-  I didn't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there.  If not for this, I'd have talked to the manager.  The food was awful and the presentation was worse.

-  Our cook even screwed up the \"onion volcano\"...first time I've ever seen this botched.

-  Kabutos wasn't always bad.  I used to eat there every few months back in the 90's (before I moved away).  It's really gone downhill.  They now serve mostly rice and (now) noodles, and only a few bites of vegetables...all of which are completely over-seasoned.  I honestly think the cook just doesn't know any better."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost ( literally). The food was HORRIBLE from brownish not fresh salad down to dry hibachi chicken. And to top it off sushi was worse than local grocery store and double the price ( should have stop with sushi) please learn from my mistake!!"}
{"text":"The japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in Charlotte. I've been here a couple of times with my co workers, but what really irks me about this place was the other week I was craving for Japanese food so I order a TO-GO plate to pick up for lunch. How about they charge a 15% TO-GO gratitude!!! You heard that right. I've never seen such a place charged you for tip when you aren't even sitting in there asking for service. My to go meal ended up being $16 bucks after taxes and tip. 

On top of that the fried rice was bland, its basically just cook in tons of butter. The meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies! They definately won't be getting my business again!!"}
{"text":"We work across the street and we love Kabuto. Last Christmas, we chose Kabuto for our holiday party. The staff took care of us start to finish and the food was great. I recommend the double NY strip.  Sushi roll for an app."}
{"text":"Totally love the sirloin or chicken  lunch special for under $10.  Can't beat that hibachi goodness."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst experiences. The server greeted us and was very professional and took order. Granted the other patrons were let's just say challenging but he handled it with grace. Then the chef came. He struggled with the order then forgot about us. We had to ask for condiments and then he ignored us. The food was just ok. We don't plan to go back. Now I know why there is a line at the other Japanese restaurant 500 yards down the road."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better. The service wasn't bad, and the presentation was typical. Just nothing special. I have no specific complaints, but nothing to brag about or remember, either."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a restaurant a negative rating, this establishment would receive it.  My family and I have frequented Kabuto for years, but it has deteriorated so significantly we will never return.  The restaurant is run down, and not cleaned thoroughly.  On our trip tonight my four year old asked why it smelled bad when walking in the door.  The quality of the food has substantially gone down while the prices have increased.  The vegetables on the hibachi were not done at all, while the steak I ordered had a rancid taste.  When I complained the \"owner\" started raising her voice at me in front of my young daughter and three other family members screaming that she would not allow me to say the steak I had been served was spoiled.  There is a reason this restaurant is having to run specials on a large plastic sign out front, and why the last time we visited there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It is very sad to watch a once good local establishment run into the ground."}
{"text":"First off, I never leave a review for any restaurants, good or bad.  This is my first and most likely last review I will post on yelp.  I come to this place pretty regularly.  My office building is just about a 5 minute drive away.  I always place my order online and then pick it up, super convenient.   I have never had an issue with this place until today.  The food here is fine and usually the service here is fine too.  However, today was a totally different story.  Unfortunately, this review will be about the terrible customer service, rather than the food.  I placed my order online at around 11:30AM and the pickup time was 12:05PM.  I arrived about 5 minutes early around 12:00PM and told the waiter that I was there to pick up an order.  He nods and goes into the kitchen, comes back out and speaks to another customer, apologizing about the wait.  He did not give me any sort of update about my order.  He proceeds to ask the 3 other people if they would like a drink while waiting.  He did not ask me the same question.  He proceeds to give everyone else their drinks and gives them an update about their order.  Again, he skips over me.  After about 5 minutes of this waiter running in and out of the kitchen, he finally looks and me and asks if I would like a drink while waiting.  I tell him yes and what I want to drink.  Instead of getting my drink, he runs back into the kitchen to check up on other orders.  About 10 minutes later, he realizes that he never gave me my drink and apologizes.  He proceeds to fill my cup in front of me, but leaves it on the bar and goes back into the kitchen.  After a few more minutes, he finally puts a lid on the drink and hands it to me.  During this time, more customers come in wanting to pick up their orders.  He proceeds to ask for the name on the order, asks if they'd like a drink while waiting, and proceeds to apologize to them about the wait.  He did not give me the same courtesy.  After about 25 minutes, I finally decide to ask who I assume is the manager, if he could check how much longer my food will be.  He gets my name and heads back into the kitchen.  He comes out a few minutes later and tells me that my order is coming off the grill and he walks away.  A to go order comes out, and the waiter hands it to this other lady who was at the bar before I arrived.  The manager comes back to the bar area a few minutes later and sees me still waiting, goes back into the kitchen and asks the waiter where my order was.  The waiter says he gave the order to the customer already, to which the manager points out that I am Nancy, not the lady who he gave the order to minutes early.  Again, no one apologizes or lets me know what happened.  It is now 12:30PM, I and now slightly irritated, so I ask for my money back.  I didn't want to wait any longer.  FINALLY, when I asked for my money back, someone actually apologized half heartily about the situation.  I eat here all the time, I never let bad customer service stop me from eating somewhere unless the food is terrible too.  However, I do not believe I will returning to this restaurant.  I have posted a note in the office break room about this place as well.  I was never upset about the wait because I understand that things happen and the kitchen can get backed up, nothing can be done about that.  However, I had never experienced such terrible service like this here or any place I have been to."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic hibachi experience, this is not the place. The steak was not seasoned and I had to ask for chop sticks. Good for kids, bad for people who appreciate good Japanese food."}
{"text":"Everything was OK. Service - Ok. Food - Ok. Cleanliness - Ok. Nothing truly stood out flavor wise. I ordered the Hibachi Chicken dinner. Had to add lots of salt and pepper to the entire meal. PS- I usually don't add salt to anything!"}
{"text":"My family with my grandkids went there again on Friday 3/30/18.
It was outstanding!  be sure to order the fillet and the salad and all of the vegetables were awesome!  The chefs put on a great show and are super friendly.  I recommend this place to everyone who likes freshly prepared meals at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I used to go here at least once a week.. The price for the dinner special is good (sun-wed). My boyfriend and I got acquainted with some of the waitresses & staff- Lisa is great and so is the chef with the butcher knife tattoo lol. But, unfortunately the past few times have been horrible.. It's either a hit or miss with them. The chefs should all be trained to cook the same way but it seems as if some are lacking essential skills. The food has been bland with no seasoning or taste during the past few visits, I then reached out to management and they replaced our meal for free. Great, except it is STILL tasteless. I would only recommend going here if you know your chef is up to par."}
{"text":"Not the best Hibachi Steakhouse. When I went everything was very old. Menus were falling apart at the seams. Also little details like their matches pack to go have other locations crossed out with a sharpie marker. Our cook was definitely great but overall experience was extremely bland for the price."}
{"text":"My experience was okay.  Hibachi meals are not my favorite, but my 9 yr old date was the boss, so hibachi it was!  After a previous disappointing experience at Nakato, I chose Kabuto.

The interior feels sort of uninspired, but I didn't notice that it was unclean. The menu seems a bit more limited than other hibachi grills, but there were still plenty of choices.  In the end, it was all pretty standard - watery soup, iceberg with ginger dressing (although they do give you the choice of ranch), veggies, noodles, rice and protein.  The white sauce was good.  No ginger sauce - that was disappointing!  The chef was fine, he was good with the kids at our table, but not as friendly with the adults.  Our server was excellent though!  She was very efficient and attentive.

For two of us (adult and one child), the bill with tip was over $40, which I am frugal enough to feel entitles me to a really great meal.  Kabuto was just okay though."}
{"text":"Why make a reservation if you'll have to wait 30-40 minutes for a table anyways? We had a larger party, but if a reservation is made there's no reason for that long of a wait. We were never offered to see a menu or get a drink, just told over and over: \"Sorry, It will be ready soon.\" When you finally do get to sit down, you don't get to relax or enjoy yourself because you're so rushed to eat each course. Food was ok, your usual hibachi fare (and not the best I've had either). I thought the chef was funny and nice which would've been the highlight of this review. Unfortunately, he made an inappropriate joke at my expense halfway through preparing our meal, calling my date a \"Lucky guy, she's got a big mouth\" after we caught zucchini in our mouths. Out of line and made even worse by the fact that I'm seventeen and he was at least 35...Let's hope I never have to go back here."}
{"text":"I would genuinely not recommend this restaurant.  The food is okay. The servings are worth the amount you pay though. The sushi was not fresh for me and ruined my first experience of trying sushi. This was my first time at a hibachi restaurant and i was left disappointed. Our waitress was an young hispanic looking woman who seemed to be just out of it. She never came to bus the tables or even asked if we were okay. We had to call her over to our table multiple times for the same things repeatedly. Almost seemed like she was on a drug or something. The waiting time was ridiculous. We had to wait forever for over food. The people that came after us was served before us and when we asked the waitress why she simply stated that it was because \"they had less people\". When in reality they had 3 just like we did. She assumed that we were all together just because we were all black. The people that were waiting in front of us decided to leave from being hungry and not being serviced. During our whole time there. The lady never came to clean up that side of the table at all. Then it was a bug in one of my friends drink. While the cup was also dirty. The only thing that made this visit okay was the chef and the people we were sitting by. Don't waste your time on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Kabuto is one of those places I can come once a year and be done with it. Average Japanese Steakhouse experience.  The service is friendly and the food is good but it's just not as amazing of an experience as it would seem. The bar drinks are not very innovative and are just sugary mixers and liquor. The kids do enjoy the 'spectacle' of the noise and cooking but once it's over everyone is just sitting there eating around a huge table."}
{"text":"Went for friends birthday party. Very good food. But i have to say, my chef was NOT entertaining at all. He didn't talk very much and when he did, he talked quietly. He didn't do anything most of the other waiters were doing. I was disappointed in my chef's behavior. But the food was excellent."}
{"text":"The food is really good and priced decent, the chefs are pretty cool too but the hostess is awful. The dark haired one took about ten minutes to come to the stand and then barked at me saying they were closed. I politely asked what time they closed and she said 9:30 in a tone like i was an idiot. Then she pointed to the clock that said 9:33. I was 3 minutes late, no need to yell. Lol. Probably will only go back for take out. She was a bitch and she was the first person I saw when I got in there so it started me off wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and hibachi! The atmosphere is great! Staff is very friendly and provides exceptional service! Best restaurant in the city for birthdays, celebrations, or a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Don't come if you want to eat. Food is bland, if it even shows up. 4 of us got our lunch and even though we repeatedly told her our 5th guy still didn't have his food and I was missing my appetizer, it took me tracking down the manager to get his lunch. Then they told me they were out of the spring roll ingredients but didn't ask me if I wanted something else until after they cooked and brought the guy's missing lunch. Complete incompetence. We should have gone to Chili's."}
{"text":"Oh no, Kabuto.  Went with BF's family for a family celebration.  We had reserved the large room for our group.  When we arrived, we were told by the hostesses to wait to speak with the manager.  The bedraggled manager plodded over and informed us that the room had been mistakenly double-booked and another party had already been seated in the room.  She tried for about 25 seconds to be pleasant and apologetic, but then her willingness to make her customers happy wore thin.  She harumphed and threw her hands in the air while saying, \"We made a mistake.  What do you want us to do?\"  Well, I definitely want you to learn how to act like a professional.

We declined being seated amongst the party in the large room and took one of the tables in the middle of the dining room.  The place was shabby and the floor was filthy.  I mean, I typically wouldn't notice, because I'm not looking at the floor, but it was noticeably dirty.  The food was average.  The one highlight: the chef was professional, light-hearted and entertaining.  He couldn't save the day, though.  I would not return, and I cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I remember coming to Kabuto and the chefs would actually entertain you - no matter how old you are. Nowadays, you can't get them to smile at you. I went to lunch with my mother earlier this week and we were appalled at how bad the customer service was. They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1:15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1:15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1:50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2:00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail. I would give Kabuto at least a 4 rating, but I would highly recommend that they work on their customer service first. Hopefully, when I see better results from other patrons on here, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to rate Kabuto on the level of all the other places in charlotte and surrounding and it certainly does not match up well at all . I did try their sushi and the teppanyaki. The sushi was basically grocery store level maybe even worse and the teppanyaki was overly salty. The quality of all there food simply was not there. They did put on a decent show though and I would recommend it for families with kids or if you live near by and do not want to travel to the other better places. Other than that they have similar prices to other places so it is a waste of your money."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good, I recommend the spicy tuna rolls. Also if you're getting sushi and hibachi ask for children's it's practically the same as adults"}
{"text":"Well it's not the place it use to be. We went there for my birthday per the kids request and we had the typical experience which was a lot of banging, a lot of yelling and a lot of fire. I can understand why kids love this place, me not so much. I use to enjoy their food back in the day but now you don't get nearly the amount you use to get and what is with \"Japanese Katsup?\" That stuff is nasty. Didn't they use to give you two sauces? I had to ask for something different and truth be told that sauce wasn't much better and the chef seemed upset with me when I told him I wasn't a fan of the Japanese Katsup. Dude get over it and go make your ring of fire.

 The food was MEH. Miso soup which really was chix broth with a little (and I stress little) sliced scallion and 2 thin slices of mushrooms, a salad which was Iceberg (BLEH) and their famous Ginger dressing, which I do admit, I like.

The entrees were MEH as well. I had the fillet, scallops and shrimp. My husband had the fillet and lobster. Our steaks were cooked perfectly but I think the chef was upset at the seafood because he MURDERED it. Every piece of seafood was so overcooked, it was like we had the fillet with rubber bands. I understand you want to put on a show but can you at least do it with the zucchini and leave the seafood be?

That evening my son and I had some sushi as well and I will say the fish was VERY fresh. Had I known the chef was going to incinerate my entree, I would have just stuck with the sushi."}
{"text":"Initial reaction upon walking in - in need of renovation.   I decided to stay as my daughter had never been to this type of restaurant.   Staff was very friendly (hostess, waitress and chef).   I found the food to be good but expensive for what you get.   Ice berg lettuce salad was very disappointing.    Most importantly, I was not comfortable with the cleanliness of the restaurant (under table, under and around stove they cook on).     I won't be back.   If they totally renovate I might give it one more try"}
{"text":"Love the Hibachi chicken, comes with two jumbo shrimp, soup, salad, noodles, rice and vegetables!!! Took some home!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go a for more times since my last review, and every single time they leave out the soup! Today I ordered and paid an extra dollar to get salad, and when I picked it up I asked if it was mine and confirmed there was a salad and said oh no there's a soup in there, handed it to me and I asked for a salad, which it was nice of her to give to me since I ordered it. But, when I opened the bag there was no soup!!  I'm just starting to think they just have no soup for to go orders... cmon!"}
{"text":"First off, I sat in the sushi bar area. I have not eaten in the dinner area yet. So my opinion is solely based off of the sushi bar area. This place is mediocre at best, the tofu was ok, a little blane. Disappointed in the miso soup, it had this weird taste that I can't quite place. The sushi was pretty good for the most part. Almost everything had cream cheese in it, I do not like cream cheese in my sushi and had to ask for it without. The server took forever at first but was friendly; the sushi chefs were very nice and friendly as well. I probably won't come back to eat but it was ok to try at least once. I just know better sushi places. They had a crappy and small sake selection and their cheapest bottle was 18. I didn't even bother to get anything; I love sake and I always get it. Most of the time I can find something I like but they just had such a little selection of nothing good. Also I had to get a new soy sauce bowl. The one I had was dirty. I feel you should pay more attention to that. This place is ok. I don't know how the dinner part is but after my experience I have low expectations of it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered sushi near the lunch cutoff.  25 minutes later after everyone else is halfway through the meal I am informed that the sushi guy left stating I ordered late.  Manager comes out and only apologizes offering nothing else. At this point I am not going to order anything else as everyone is more than halfway through the meal.  Manager gets 0 stars.  Table cook gets 3 stars as none of this is his fault. Server gets 2 stars and tried to redeem himself (maybe he put the order in too late as he was slow on a few other occasions) by offering his own personal sushi order he had in back.  Not sure where the blame falls the most, but sushi guy should never leave before all the table orders have been taken.  I guess lack of manager oversight.  Service seems to get worse every time I come here and the cleanliness needs some attention."}
{"text":"Biggest disappointment after years of eating at Kabuto. We sat at the front table and ordered sushi. While the hibachi area was packed we did not anticipate a long wait for sushi.   The server took our order and never came back.  We ordered a few rolls and they slowly started coming after a 45 minute wait. The manager apologized but very insincerely. I believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills. The final roll came 50 minutes after we first ordered and it was wrong not once but twice.  Very disappointed and will be hesitant to go back - at least on a Sunday night with an inexperienced staff."}
{"text":"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. 

This place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....

You can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. 

Service is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \"Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\" Pretty much always my thought process. 

This place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. 

Thanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"}
{"text":"Double date night out.  Chef Diego.  Very entertaining.

Pleasant surprise had noodles, my preference.  Fried rice too.  Too much at one meal. Took home.

Standard medium shrimp appetizer.  Clear broth soup.  House salad with ginger dressing too much dressing. Salad swimming in it.

New York strip.  Good.
2 ladies has jumbo shrimp.  Great.
Other guy has New York strip & chicken.  Good.
Really like fried mixed vegetables.
We shared a variety of sauces.  Soy, ginger, mustard.

We had a good time.

Disappointed no Koi fish in pond to feed.  Sushi chef said they used all up for dinner that night."}
{"text":"Worst place I've EVER been to. It does not even deserve a one star. Service was horrible. Place is nasty and needs to be cleaned. Grill had leftover old burnt food and I asked for the grill to be cleaned before cooking..pretty much got laughed at by staff members and they continued to cook on grill. Ceiling leaked on me the whole time and I was told they couldn't do anything about it. The rice was extremely hard..I broke the fill in my tooth from eating the rice. 250 dollars later I was told that they are sorry for my experience....wow all I wanted was rice to be cooked correctly so I could eat a meal worth 25 dollars a person. The waitress had an attitude and the cook was very rude. The manager did not care at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hibachi place. When we started going to this location over 3 years ago, we only went once in a while for a nice fun dinner. Eventually, we learned about their express lunch special which made it affordable for us to go a lot more often! For the express lunch, you will get smaller portions than you do at dinner, but you're paying less, too. I, for one, love the express lunch portions because they're perfect for me! I can rarely clean my plate of all of the food at a full dinner. As with any place, you never know who you're going to get as a chef. Some of the chefs are laid back and fun to casually chat with or joke with while they prepare your food. Some go through the motions of the showmanship and some simply come, cook, and leave. I will admit that the express lunch service hasn't been as efficient lately as it's been in the past (it used to be seated, orders, food, check, out and now has a lot of down time and waiting). Sometimes you'll go a while without a drink refill which is a bit of a pain with how small the glasses are and how much ice is in them. Sometimes it gets difficult to flag someone down. You can still be in and out in about 45-60 mins which isn't bad for a freshly-cooked lunch mid-workday. We hope to be checking out the fairly new express dinner next week as we'll have family in town who will be on a budget.

Tip: If you get your salad with ginger dressing, hold on to your bowl when you're done and dip your meats in the ginger dressing. It's tasty.

Tip: Chopsticks and ginger dipping sauce must be asked for. You will only be provided with one sauce instead of the two that most other places provide.

Tip: If you are having trouble flagging someone down, (nicely) tell your chef what you need. The waitstaff are quick to respond to a request from the chef and they're usually a lot better at getting the attention of the runners."}
{"text":"My son graduated from kindergarten and desperately wanted to go to \"the place where they cook in front of you.\" He loves the experience (because he's 6, y'all) It turned into quite possibly the worst dining experience we've ever had. The chef was terrible-he dropped or missed every \"trick\" and the food was burned. He squirted water directly into my son's eye and when trying to show him a trick, knocked his soup over, which spilled all over my son's clothes. For a 6 year old, to be covered in lukewarm soup in a restaurant with the air conditioner on high made for an incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassing experience. To \"make up\" for it, the chef sent out ice cream and he did apologize. We quickly asked for boxes without eating more than two bites. There was no comp of our son's meal, whose evening was ruined. He left the restaurant with a bloodshot eye and an entire outfit soaked. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty fun place to be on a Saturday. This place come alive and it's busy.. Then entertainment in itself is pretty awesome.
I had the steak and lobster hibachi. Plus 2 bottles of wine. I mean when you're hungry, that's what you do. You over ordered and definitely over eat.. My food was delicious and our chef is funny and nice..
Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were having a great time at Kabuto. Our food was great and the hibachi chef was fantastic. However, as my friend was eating her final bite of fried rice, she pulled out a piece of steel wool from her mouth. Horrified, her sister told the managerial staff. They apologized, but that was sort of it. \"Get the manager\" moms beware: they only give you an employee discount off the meal."}
{"text":"This resturant is close to the airport! They havr decent prices. I ordered chicken hibachi dinner and it was $15. I had leftovers, so that was a plus.  The waitress could have been friendlier"}
{"text":"It was a very fun experience.  The food was good, fast and lots of it!  Took my mother in law for her Bday so that it was something different that normal steak house.  The chef was somewhat entertaining, but not near us much as some other places that I have experienced.  We were there for Lunch and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food that we received.  However, I would have been disappointed to receive the same amount for the much higher dinner prices."}
{"text":"We were looking for restaurants that deliver in this area. When we saw we could get Kabuto for lunch we were ecstatic. The on line ordering website was also very easy. But the rest was a horrible experience. they called me and said we could not get all of our side items and that the website was out of date. That was 1 hour after we ordered. It took 1.5 hours to get our food. The restaurant nor the EAT 24 PEOPLE could find the driver. And of course the food is cold. And missing some items.   Only go inside to eat Kabuto. And i do not reccommend the app EAT 24 at all."}
{"text":"I went to Kabuto for sushi with a friend. Turns out Tuesdays in January sushi rolls are buy one get one half off- yay! I'm not a sushi expert in any sense, and their menu is fairly large, so I ordered from what I was already familiar with. Maybe next time I'll ask to learn more about the menu. Anyway, I do know that I ordered one roll with yellowtail, one with softshell crab, and an order of edamame. I'm not a picky eater and this was my first time trying both, but I wasn't crazy about flavor of the softshell crab. However, we sat at the bar where the sushi was being made, which was a neat experience, and the chef was very friendly and made sure we enjoyed what we were eating. Our server was always available, and our drink glasses were never empty. I look forward to trying more sushi at Kabuto!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place and so do I. It's always a good show and the food is delicious! My kids remember their first times here and it's always their pick for birthday dinners and special occasions. 

Their menu has some flexible options which allow you to get on the items you want. Love it"}
{"text":"I've been to the University area and Tyvola locations and this year we tried this one for my oldest sisters birthday dinner with the fam.  I found a buy 1 get 1/2 off coupon online and brought it with me.  It was pretty empty at 5:30 on a Wednesday, so no trouble getting a table and we were sat right away.

Our server was nice and he got our drink order and soups our right away.  Had some mai tai's to start, sooo strong it took me the whole dinner to drink mine.  we all pretty much got shrimp and it was fishy, should have gotten the jumbo shrimp which is what they used for the shrimp appetizer.  Everything else was pretty good though, love the veggies and they give you noodles in addition to rice here.  I only wish they did the sprouts here, I love sprouts!!

Our chef was done really fast since we had all shrimp and 1 rare steak.  The server at one point asked whose birthday it was and then that was it, not even an offer if any of us wanted dessert, just gave us the check.  No big deal since we were stuffed, but different from any other Japanese steak house I've been to where they usually sing and give a complimentary dessert.  Oh well it was still a decent reasonably priced meal and the nephews love it so I'm sure we'll be back for her bday next year!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Place had no sushi available to order.  They were out of beer.  Place was dirty and smelled of dirty dish water.  Took 20 minutes to get a beer. Just horrible.  For the love of god, pass on this place if at all possible."}
{"text":"I would think this place warrants a potential visit from the health department. We walked into the lobby and were appalled by the filth in the carpet and stench. Overall when we entered the place had a musty stench. When we were seated is when the real horrors started. The carpet underneath us was caked with old food and never cleaned; we were the first and only guests in the place so who knows how long the filth on the floor had been there. When they placed the ragged menu in front of us I knew it was a sign! Even the menu looked beat up! But it gets worse, oh yes it can... there was dried and old food and rice on and around the grill! Did they expect to cook my new food with the old? I literally and physically gagged and got up and left! The End!"}
{"text":"Went there with my three children all under the age of 7 and our friends family with their children. The entertain was great for the kids and the chef was very interactive and engaged the children. There was a lot of yelling and shouting from other tables, so it was hard for the adults to talk. The food was great."}
{"text":"On April 4th, I went with three friends to Kabuto, located at 446 Tyvola Road, Charlotte NC. Two of my friends were celebrating birthdays, so this was a special occasion.
 
We set at a grill with one other patron. Three of our party ordered the Hibachi Chicken, and one ordered the Jalapeno Chicken. By way of context, the other patron had a shrimp dish.
 
Our chef did a great job with his presentation and, given my allergy to shellfish, he was careful to ensure that our food was cooked separately from the other patron's shrimp. I greatly appreciated that.
 
The chef at the grill was preparing the various food items for our plates, and of course, that takes some time; however, the member of our party who ordered the Jalapeno Chicken was still waiting for her food, which certainly should have been delivered by that stage.
 
Our waiter, Trevor, advised us that her food should be served in five minutes. At the same time, we noticed that another table (seated after us) had received their sushi, and the gentleman at our table had requested and received his to-go box. At this point, at least 20 minutes had passed. Trevor returned to the table, apologized for the inordinate delay, and said the cost of the Jalapeno Chicken would be removed from our bill. While we appreciated the gesture, the delay was unacceptable and, frankly, baffling. Trevor explained that the back kitchen was overwhelmed with orders. In that case, why did others seated after us receive their food ahead of our order?
 
Trevor said he had \"done all he could do\", adding that there was \"no need to get an attitude\". At this point, I requested to speak with the manager.
 
A few minutes later, Christia came to our table. I apprised her of the situation and our disappointment in the excessive delay in receiving food for one of the members of our group who was celebrating her birthday. I also informed her of Trevor's confrontational response. Christia apologized, saying that \"Trevor also gives attitude to other staff members.\" In my opinion, that last statement demonstrated a lack of professionalism. She further went on to say that the chef was struggling to keep up with orders and that \"he gets frazzled when busy.\" Again, not an appropriate comment to make to guests.
 
At that point, the Jalapeno Chicken finally arrived-two skewers bearing four pieces of chicken each set upon a measly handful of lettuce (see below picture).
 
I asked Christia if she felt this lack of service and small portion of food warranted a discount for the entire party.  Christia's response: \" I have to be honest and say no\" The most discount she could give in any circumstance would be 10% bud did not feel that it would be appropriate in this situation. Upon receipt of the checks by Trevor, Christia had discounted each by 10% and not charged for the Jalapeno Chicken.
 
In summary, this was a highly disappointing experience, and the situation was poorly handled by both Trevor and Christia. They were dismissive or our concerns and we were not made to feel like valuable guests. I hope you will understand that the restaurant has lost four customers as a result."}
{"text":"Love the day I found out that Kabuto's had an excellent sushi bar - I go once a week or so - sometimes for take out and sometimes to sit in. they often have dine-in specials on sushi Tuesday to Thursday which we took advantage of today. Fresh, tasty and just perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Chef was confused....food was blah. Service was friendly and prompt but Geesh...the chef was a hot mess. The atmosphere was fun and watching the other tables and their awesome cooks made the multiple couples at the table jealous. Ensuring the chefs have personality and flare would make this place amazing . Food quality was very good"}
{"text":"Decided to go Japanese today!  Checked out Kabutos for lunch. As always I was not disappointed. I have been there for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the dark flaming atmosphere. It is very romantic and fun at the same time. However I have never tried their lunch menu. 

Today that changed. I ordered the shrimp with fried rice and noodles. I upgraded to the large shrimp for an additional $2.95 which I highly recommend. 

Service was the only disappointment today. It seems might be a little understaffed. I waited over 5mins for a refill on tea which I rarely let go that far. Other than that the food was delicious and chefs great. The only reason for the 4stars and not 5stars was the tea incident. I will have to try them again in a month or so to give an update."}
{"text":"Best restaurants ever I so recommend this to anyone!!! I love the workers they are so nice and the food is quick and is Cheap"}
{"text":"My first time and the Last time!  The first 10 minutes was fine, but the rest was a waste of our time and money. $85.00 in the toilet. Most everything tasted bland. Especially the rice, noodles and vegetables. Very little flavor in meats as well with the exception of the scallop. 

We had reservations and were seated promptly. The three of us on one end of the table and a family of three on the other end. I was happy because when I'm the last one seated at a table I feel rushed trying to eat quickly trying to catch up. So we were waiting on the rest of the table to fill up. Next thing I know the other three are gone and just us at the big table. We did have our cocktails. They took our orders and two minutes our soup was salad was served at the same time. 

At this point I'm confused. Where are the rest of the people at our table? All other tables were full and people were still coming in. I barely had time to taste the soup when the chef arrives to prepare dinner. I complained to deaf years. But I made it clear this was not what I expected. 

No interaction with other guests. No fun atmosphere. I was looking forward to at least a little bit of entertainment. But instead a dull time while the full table next to us were laughing and having a blast!!!  

The highlight of my night was clapping when they were singing happy birthday to another guest at another table. I was so angry. All I did was focus on my soup and salad. I had them half eaten when the chef (lol) started filling my plate with the tasteless food from the grill. 

I tasted everything and that is all I could stomach since I was so upset. The other two people with me did eat their food and we left. 

So I wanted to check them out and I did and they sucked so back to Nakato's Japanese restaurant. They are better. 

If they plan to stay in business... Many changes need to happen."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte, by far.  You can waste your money at all of the chi-chi, trendy joints in town - or you can go to kabuto, where the sushi is delicious (and cheap!)"}
{"text":"Our chef was great but our server forgot to turn grill on to prepare for the chef.  The waiter was then asking about checks and boxes, basically ending our dinner, immediately after the chef left. The restaurant was not busy so we should not have been so rushed. It was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food is okay... when they get your order right. The service is horrible. The last three times we've been in, our food was brought out one dish/plate at a time. Some of us at the table are eating and the rest end up getting our food as the others are finishing. AND all three times the orders were wrong, so you can either wait again for the right order or just eat whatever the hell they bring out. Meanwhile trying to get the waitress to stay off her cell phone long enough to hear your complaint is impossible. I've tried three times now to see if things would improve, but I'm done. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!! The food was great!! Our chef was excellent and the hostess was amazing!!! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We came in with a large group. Just around 20 people for a Surprise Birthday Party. We had the best time possible. We had to have two table to fit us all but this restaurant made that no problem at all. We had two chefs and two servers but everything went smoothly. They took our drink order as soon as we sat down and in afew minutes they placed our food order. Very fast service. Very kind and efficient service. I tipped the chef and the wait staff. Just so you know they have large portions. Even the small kids plate was filled. Their food was amazing but I couldn't even finish my plate. I had the chicken dish and it came with soup first, then salad with ginger dressing ( yum ), then he threw shrimp and cut up vegetables all around for bus to catch in our mouth, then he cooked on the grill, garlic noodles, fried rice, and everyone's meat. The chef was spectacular!!! Thanks to this restaurant the surprise party was out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi good, hibachi needs work.  I went at 8 pm on a Friday and it was minimal people in there.  I ordered carryout because I just finished driving 7 hours and just wanted to rest.  I got the hibatch lobster for $28 and the Kamakazi roll.  The roll was good.  The lobster was very very very dry.  The rice was average and the veggies were cooked well.  Overall, not a bad experience but quality is not inline with the price."}
{"text":"Horrible! Service/food...horrible. Damn chef dropped half of my chicken breast on the floor while trying to flip it. Apparently he didn't think anyone noticed...so he cuts my other chicken breast in small little DICED pieces to make it look like I received 2 breasts. What an idiot!! When I complained to the manager, he took over 10 minutes to come over to the table and the idiot chef was already heading back to the kitchen. When I pointed out the breast on the floor (yep! idiot chef left it there on the floor), the manager claimed it was there from earlier and was not part of my meal. Idiots I tell you.....IDIOTS!

And the carpet is filthy, bathroom has no heat...you can smell bleach while eating dinner."}
{"text":"The food is... OK..... The atmosphere is... Ok... 

But how does a Japanese hibachi not know what an unagi roll is? (No, it's not crab sashimi, contrary to what our waitress thought. 

So not worth it."}
{"text":"In Charlotte on business and did not want to travel too far from the hotel... options Chili's, Sonny's, Kabuto or Costco Deli.  Not that I do t love a slice of pizza from Costco, but I had to try something new and unique tot he area (also I had BBQ earlier that day).

So I ordered a variety of items from teriyaki to sushi to noodles and salads.  All were very good!  I did not try the hibachi as it was just me on a business date with myself, but from what I gathered, the people eating at the Hibachi tables really seemed to be enjoying themselves.  

The only negative I would say is a lack of bar/happy hour specials and a limited bar."}
{"text":"We will never go back here sadly. 4 adults and 3 kids and we all enjoyed our hibachi but All of the adults got sick after dinner that evening. We thought it was just the 2 of us until we talked to our friends the next morning who also spent all night in the restroom. Ugh"}
{"text":"My closest sushi is complemented by a neighborhood friendliness in the staff that makes the environment a great meal.

I've never received an order of sushi from the chef, in either take-out or at the bar service that wasn't followed up with friendly care and conversation.  I even feel guilty that I can't recall his name tonight.  In today's post-modern chill, Kabuto staff works to keep a neighborhood feel at the sushi bar, and congenial conversation if you're looking for it.  I've always been pleased with the sushi, as well as treated to a few of the chef's off-menu creations every once in a while.  

To most establishments the art of service is lost, here it is practiced with Eastern respect."}
{"text":"When we came to Kabuto for lunch on Saturday we had in tow a couple of sad kids who had just been dealt a little bad news.  So we drove to one Japanese steak house for lunch; closed until 5:00.  Looking on our phones for a new place to go, we found Kabuto.  We got there just in time to take advantage of the lunch menu.  The kids had a ball, and very soon their troubles were far behind them.  Our chef made them laugh, and they devoured their meal.  Truthfully, I've had better Hibachi.  It was really good food, but I have had better in comparison to other places.  But when my little ones go into a restaurant with frowns on their faces and come out laughing and happy, I gotta give the place credit.  We'll definitely be back.  It was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Sushi is something you MUST have.... defy YUMMY and a delight to vegetarian. Visited that place several times! Early bird special - thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  We ordered the dinner entrees.  Impressed by the cooking skills of the chef but the food tastes blah, not even ordinary. Ginger dressing for salad tastes good and also the boss and volcano roll. Staff were not as attentive as other restaurants. Very pricey and they automatically add 18% gratuity with your bill."}
{"text":"This place use to be the BEST! It has gone down tremendously! I am very disappointed with my experience from last night during my husbands Father's Day dinner. We waited over an hour after being seated before our cook decided to show up. Once he came out unfortunately he did NOT seem enthusiastic at all about being in our presence and putting on a good performance for our kids. Secondly, the portions of food where so small we didn't even need to go boxes at all ( this is the first time ever, we always have leftovers but NOT last night). I expect a good amount of food and superior service when I'm paying 30$ per. plate. The server didn't understand English well which is totally fine, however she seemed very aggravated when asked questions about the menu. Moving forward we'll be going to  Nakato or elsewhere. I really use to love this place. Nowadays people could careless about quality and good service everyone's in it for profit only!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite experience at a Japanese Steakhouse. My food was good-- not phenomenal, but good. My waiter was relatively inattentive (and spoke limited English), and thus, got my order wrong; thankfully, everything is made in front of you, so this was fixed and I enjoyed my filet and lobster as ordered. That stated, this place is just too loud (and I'm eighteen, so that says a lot), and the service feels rushed.

My suggestion? Go to the Nakato down the road."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience from start to finish. Seated right away, the place just looks tired, like the owners are only keeping it open to launder money or for a tax write off. 

They forgot our rice, the chef didn't do any cool tricks for our table, the food was average and it took them 10 mins to bring the check, and another 15 mins to provide change for two twenties... So 25 mins sitting there after the meal was finished. 

Won't be going back here again. Better options. Like eating a bag of combos."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good things about this place.  The theatrics by the cooking staff is great.  They talk to each other, crack jokes, and have a great time doing what they do.  It would be a great place to take your kids.  There were a lot of young well behaved children there enjoying themselves when I went there for dinner.  There is also a little Koi pond with a bridge that you walk over when you head to the Hibachi grills.  

The quality of the food at Kabuto is about average.  One thing that was a little disappointing, was the portions.  Even though I was the only one at the table to finish their meal, I feel that at similar restaurants I have gotten larger portions.  
Lunch time is a lot lighter as well, but for about $9 you get a protein and two sides.  They say that they will get you in and out in 30 minutes for lunch.  Sometimes this will happen and sometimes it will not.  

Another thing I should mention is that I got a 22oz Kirin that was past it's \"enjoy by\" date.  Not far enough where I wanted to fuss but I would probably will stick to more common beers there (you would think that would be common)."}
{"text":"Excellent customer servuce for a birthday party, The chef was excellent!  Great tricks, good convo and food was fresh and hot and good! We will be back!"}
{"text":"after my Liquid Diet at Mellow Mushroom and STILL craving Sushi, I drove North Up Johnston Rd to this location. 

Walked to the \"bar\" and had 5 different kinds of sushi:

Yakitori - (Chicken and scallion skewers grilled with teriyaki sauce)
Dilworth (Salmon, Crab, Masago, Breaded, Fried, Rerolled w/rice)
Kabuto (Shrimp, Cucumber, Masago, Shitake Mushroom)
Rainbow (Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, Tuna, Salmon, Whitefish)
Salmon Crunchy Roll (Salmon & Crab lightly deep fried w/ panko (bread crumbs)


Arigato Kabuto's....... Arigato!!"}
{"text":"Good experience at Kabuto. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I always get the hibachi and my steak was cooked perfectly. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers and friends a very long time ago for a girls night.  It was a pretty awesome time!  They were able to accommodate our very large party without any trouble.  We did not have to wait long to place our order or to eat.  I was happy by the swiftness of service.

The food is delicious.  I like that they serve rice AND noodles, not that I can eat it all....well maybe I can, don't judge!  They give SO MUCH food it's crazy.  It's always fun to do hibachi.  Everyone had a good time that night and left stuffed.  Plenty of food also for the next day, that's another plus!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've had enough.  My first 1 star review.  I'm done with this place.

The Sushi is garbage but I gave up on that a long time ago.  I used to frequent this place because they had a $7.99 (now $8.99) hibachi lunch special - 30 min in and out .  Or so they claim.  

First of all, Kabuto almost never fulfills that 30 min promise.  Nope- usually more like an hour and I've been late getting back to work several times because of this.  Don't make promises you can't keep, it hurts you more than it helps.  Especially in the era of social media... shout-out to Yelp.

What else.  The hibachi lunch is extremely inconsistent depending on who your \"chef\" is.  Now I'll admit, some of them are pretty good and when you're lucky - you'll get an awesome meal for a pretty damn good price.  But from my experience this usually isn't the case (I've had the \"express\" lunch about 20 times now).  My meal was complete garbage today and I'm finally done giving Kabuto another chance."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice dinner. My goddaughters and I love going here. The service and food were excellent. The chef accommodated one of us who needed gluten free and was very nice about it. Very nice evening!"}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service! We used to always go to nakatos but kabuto is now a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Unfortunately, I was never able to try the food. My fiancée and I sat at the bar to order some drinks and somethings to go. The bartender looked at us and said I will be right with you. After approximately 10-15 mins of watching her walk by us and make \"well\" drinks we finally left."}
{"text":"Love it!! Every time I'm in Charlotte, I make sure to go eat there at least once. The shows are so entertaining and the food is perfectly prepared. The sushi is always on point- the Volcano and Salad rolls are a must try. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came for her birthday.  The people were nice. Service was excellent   The food was good but a bit pricey.  Not bad for something different every once in awhile."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and judging by the number of other families in the place their kids love it to. 

We usually split the meals between the kids and my wife and I split also. They give you so much food you can never eat it all. We've asked for special order food here before (due to food allergies) and they have bent over backwards for us. 

If you are looking for high end sushi or Japanese food this isn't your place. I'd say it is a nice place to take your kids, they get entertained by the chef while mom and dad eat in peace (at least as much as you can get).

This resturant is right behind a highshool field so watch out if it is a game night parking can get crazy."}
{"text":"You won't leave hungry that's for sure! You may even leave with leftovers, which is fine by me! Came in, sat down, orders were taken, after a little bit the chef came out and cooked everything with a show of course. The food tasted good even though I was full by the time my meat came. Price is good for the amount of food you get. Will return."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great, but the service was awful. I wouldn't go again unless sitting in hibachi area."}
{"text":"Ok, I will not say its bad, but I expected more from the reviews.  I just found it super fast and very messy. I was given my soup and then the salad 2 minutes later, then the guy was out to cook before I even to go my salad and he was not very entertaining to say the least. He had food flying all over the place. Then I ordered some mustard sauce and it was placed in front of me and 2 minutes later the guy came and took it way thinking it was the said and I could not catch him. The entire staff was hispanic, not Japanese. I will say the shrimp was tasty but the Spagetti  was odd and tasteless.   I just expected a nicer meal for that kind of money."}
{"text":"So I will try to keep my emotions out of this review as tonight's experience is still raw. It was a party of 4 celebrating our daughters 14th birthday.

We ordered two appetizers. Hold that thought for later. Waiter ask what we all want. Before we ordered we mentioned that my wife is allergic to shrimp and she wanted to make sure that they cooked the steak and chicken before cooking the shrimp as we have had done many times in this restaurant, as well as other hibachi places. He had a very poor understanding of English, but after many attempts he seems to understand, and promised that her entire meal would be prepared out back.

As he got to my order I told him I wanted the combination of fillet and chicken. Do you want fillet? No. I want the fillet and in addition to the fillet I would like you to also add chicken. So you want the chicken? No, I would like for you to place the following order - the following two items at the same time..the first item being something called fillet..and the second item is something called chicken...and I would like for you to bring them out at the same time - which is called the combination platter of fillet and chicken!!! So you would like fillet meat, and some chicken? Yes! Yes! Yes!...as I'm showing him the menu and tapping with my finger on the picture of the fillet in the picture and of the chicken and repeating four or five or six times that I would like for him both with the hibachi chef, the fillet and the chicken. He smiled and nodded and I thought it was ok anyway since once the hibachi chef was going to come out I will just remind him. Fast-forward 15 minutes. The hibachi chef at this point starts prepping and we realize that we have no appetizers that we ordered. Everyone at the table - all  three families have soup and salad and they hibachi chef is starting to prepare the vegetables the rice and the noodles.

(I'll save another paragraph - we got our apps about 20 minutes after the food was already provided ) I asked chef if he knew that my wife had an allergy and that he was going to be preparing her chicken and steak separately. He looked confused and after 3 or 4 attempts to re-explain it to him, he told me that her food was being prepared in the back. I nodded and we proceeded to wait for the food to be prepared. At this point the chef wanted to go around the table and confirm the temperature of everybody steak.

He asked me how I wanted it cooked and I said medium. I also wanted to re-confirm for the 10th time that he also was cooking me chicken. I told him again that I was getting a combination platter which included both the fillet in the chicken. He said that he didn't have any chicken on my order!! I said that was a mistake from the prior misunderstanding so I was 100% certain that I wanted to order both the file in the chicken together. He looked confused again and I reiterated again for the 11th or 12th time that I was having the steak and the chicken. At this point the other family sitting in our hibachi table started laughing because they could not believe that I had requested something as simple as steak and chicken 15 times from two different people. After getting the uncomfortable not I guess everyone agreed that I was going to get medium fillet and my chicken. We waited for our meal to be prepared. So now at this point the  veggies, rice, lo mein are done, and he starts to portioning out the food to entire table. Now, bear in mind, that my wife still has an empty plate since all of her food for supposedly being prepared in the back kitchen. So she just sat there looking at everybody eating their own food. Now that the steak has been cooked everyone liking, the chef starts chopping and placing everyone's steak, including mine and  my kids - we all got a big plate of steak.
We looked at the hibachi table to see what was left in there was a little bit of chicken and a bunch of shrimp. My daughter and I looked at each other as we contemplated whether there was enough chicken for two or three people since it did not look like more than a single serving. Our fears proved correct. The chef gave the entire chicken to my daughter and zero for yours truly! Now I will admit, I ONLY reminded him as well as the original waiter 20 times that I wanted both - I guess it was not going to happen for us!

After everyone started to eat..me without my chicken and my wife with zero food, I was livid. We looked and finally found a manager who was dumbfounded and and ran back and forth 3 times to realize there was nothing, ZERO, food being cooked for my wife! We ended up getting her food after we were all done eating our dry, under-seasoned, steak.
This was by far the worst single disaster in a restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. They ended up comping us two meals (mine and wife's). Jeez, so nice of them!

I will never eat there again, and will make sure I do everything in my power to make sure no one else does either! What a joke. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Made it just in time for lunch, arriving at 1:30pm. We actually went to Nakato first but they were closed. Our son turned nine today and HAD to have hibachi. Kabuto saved the day. 

Staff was great. We were seated immediately and our cook had a dry sense of humor that my family appreciates. He was engaging, fun and interactive. We just didn't get a song despite our nine year old announcing it was his birthday. 

Love the lunch concept of picking two sides. 

Three of us had chicken and one order of shrimp. Food was great, what you would expect at a hibachi spot. 

Our son was pleased and that's all that mattered."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cooks and servers are always friendly, food is awesome. Me and my family go frequently."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but it has changed hands and has gone COMPLETELY DOWNHILL. The prices keep rising and the food keeps getting worse. So disappointing, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Kabuto was definitely a disappointment after having been to another Hibachi restaurant recently. Upon arriving, the hostess seemed very disorganized causing chaos among some guests. 
Once we were seated it took a long time for our waiter to arrive and over 30 minutes to get our drinks.
The hibachi chef was entertaining but the vegetables were so undercooked and the rice so overcooked we didn't really enjoy that. I had the steak and shrimp, which was the best part of the meal.
Overall service is definitely slow, food blah and knowing there are better hibachi spots not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Food is good but my portion  wasn't enough what i paid for i order scallops and rice vegetables , my portion was the most least out of whole table very disappointed and i left still hungry i wish i can give them 0 feedback"}
{"text":"Never again. Although the staff was great and the food tasted good, the facilities were disgusting. I will not return until they learn to do some simple cleaning."}
{"text":"Do not go here !!! It is under new management who have clearly never run a restaurant. It is filthy inside ! The staff sitting around talking and then the service is awful. I called in a to go order that said it would be 15 mins. I arrive 15 mins later and am told it's being bagged. 20 minutes later I finally get my food but I can see the staff talking in the kitchen. A couple people kept coming out looking at me but tending to the restaurant. The worse place ever and I use to come when the other owners had it all the time. Will never go again"}
{"text":"They are the worst thus used to be good and the sushi chef is the best in Charlotte but the new menu is a disaster and the staff is clueless nobody knows what's going on i left not getting my salad waiting 25 min for sake"}
{"text":"I was taking to this restaurant for a birthday party for me and it was very pleasant. The place first of all is very nicely decorated and much to my delight it was extremely clean!

The service was very attentive, and the food was especially delicious. There were so many in our party that I do not recall what everyone had to eat, but I didn't hear any complaining just people eating. My only disappointment was that I couldn't order sushi for lunch. But what I did eat was so good that I decided to go ahead and give them five stars because I can get sushi some other time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte!  Food is fresh and always cooked to perfection.  Prices are reasonable and the service is amazingly perfect.  Must try!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place other then, it's amazing! Some of the best service and food I have had at any Japanese restaurant. The rolls selection is great and I ate here two nights in a row while on a work trip."}
{"text":"Kabutos seems to be a favorite around here. I've even heard people say it's the best they've ever tasted. My thoughts in response to that are always, \"You clearly haven't had a lot of good Japanese food\". While I do enjoy Kabutos when I go, being one of the only choices in the area. I do not think it's that great compared to other Japanese Restaurants i've tried. For the most part I've ordered togo, but i've realized, you get more food when you dine in. They put egg in their rice which I don't really understand. And being that the Yolk of an egg is too rich for me and immediately upsets my stomach, I find myself always picking the egg out of my rice. I do enjoy that they give you noodles, which was new to me. The noodles are actually pretty tasty. The shrimp are small in comparison to what you get at other Hibachi restaurants. Also all they cook in is Soy Sauce. No other sauce choices. Ot at least none have been offered to me. The manager that they always get when there is an issue and seats people from time to time, is a bit short & rude when you're not kissing her butt. The wait staff has short memories. I am always constantly reminding them of something I asked for multiple times and it's hard to communicate with some of them as they don't understand good english. Overall, this place is just OK."}
