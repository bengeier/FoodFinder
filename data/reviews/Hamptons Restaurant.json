{"text":"I was here for a quick dinner last night. I was surprised the steak was very good. It was cooked to perfection. Service was incredible. Overall a very satisfy experience. Know that they have patio right beside a park which open during summer, would absolutely return next time during daytime for the beautiful view.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant had an atmosphere like it used to be nice many years ago. Everything seemed old and appeared to be beginning to fall apart. Likewise the service was slow and disorganized.   Though the menu was large, some of the things we tried to order were not available, and the server informed us of this after we had ordered. The food was slow to arrive and inconsistent. My Reuben sandwich was at best okay, and some of the fries tasted cold and greasy.   Nothing here was terrible, but nothing was good either. I wouldn't come back, based on my experience. Granted, we were here at a bit of a weird time (1pm lunch on Sunday), but that doesn't mitigate my disappointment too much."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very dated. It is more suited for the retired crowd who is looking for some tea and sub par meal.  I would not return."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  There's a wide food selection on their menu. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"They have now redone the bar and the wings are still great.  Good thing Cuz I'm stuck here for another two weeks"}
{"text":"Can only speak about the pizza and service. Both were great and made my business trip a little nicer"}
