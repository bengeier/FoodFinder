{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by quite a delicious Mexican meal. We ordered the deluxe nachos, quesadilla and chimichanga. Overall pretty good taste. I am always afraid that restaurants over salt food which this place did not. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: Affordable, generous with their meat, fast service  Cons: sublime environment, darkly place, smoky at times coming in from casinos"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  We tried all of the proteins (grilled chicken, al pastor tacos, fish tacos, and the carne asada platter).  It felt like we were eating different flavored pieces of cardboard.  Everything was dry and overcooked.  The flavors were dull.  Such a bad representation of Mexican cuisine, which is beautiful for its way of blending dynamic flavors, fresh produce, and well prepared meats."}
{"text":"Horrible food! My nachos were ice cold asked for new and they microwaved them with the sour cream and guacamole...gag...complainec again and they made new ate a couple chips and cheese and was sick all night... As a local we will never be back"}
{"text":"I do not recommend! We ordered the arrepas (fish and chicharones) in both the meat and fish were very dry and hard the nachos \"bar\" only had green salsa with onions a few jalapenos and that was it. Used a free coupon for nachos with cheese and it was a little better but not much. We paid almost $27 for 2 people, including drinks. This place is not worth the money! Do yourself a favor and find a great Mexican restaurant outside of Circus Circus."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my family to watch the Brazil v Germany soccer game as we were in a rush and leaving Vegas soon after the game. We all settled for Mexican food and the only problem was that the game wasn't on any of their TVs. After asking one of the employees, she gladly changed the channel for us.  We got the deluxe nachos are a pre game appetizer. It was delicious and it works as an appetizer for 2-3 people. The shredded beff quesadillas are decent enough and the chicken soft tacos are excellent.  The prices were reasonable, but not the best. My only complaint was that it took a while for the food to come out, but there were quite a few people there so it's understandable.  Overall this is a great stop if you're at Circus Circus and in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"the service weren't helpful when I needed help caring trays. crowded and the Cheese Enchilada was too spicy. don't take kids there. They'll only like the chips and beans. Rice wasn't cooked."}
{"text":"Terrible! Asked the cashier what kind of fish on the fish tacos. She didnt know so she asked the cook and he didn't know so he pulled out a chunk and said whitefish. Should have known to turn and run then."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for the worst cafeteria food I've had in a long time. Pretty sure they microwaved my burrito..."}
{"text":"I bought a carne asada burrito and it was disgusting.  The meat was really chewy. That's what I get for not reading the Yelp reviews before eating there."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Place was dead. Did not even honor my coupon. Stay away from this place! The manager did not even bother to come out. They definitely do not take their customers very seriously so I would not trust them with my food."}
{"text":"By far the worse place i've ever been to. Chips were stale and the sopes are horrible!!! Save yourself the $$$ and go to tacos el gordo instead!!!!"}
{"text":"We didnt want to stray too far away from our hotel at Circus Circus with our young children. We were passing through so we got there late and wandered around Adventuredome and stopped at one of the restaurants there. I didn't read the reviews, which I wished I did because I wasted our money there for two plates and a side of beans and rice. The food was flavorless and the salsa had an off taste to it. The Carne Asada tacos were bland and the rolled tacos were dry and super salty. I'm usually pretty content with Mexican food but this wasnt enjoyable at all."}
{"text":"Foods are pretty good, love those beans and enviroment are good too. Don't get why the rate are that low on yelp. Order 4 things and barely can finish by 3 people. Love that chicken bowl and the soup."}
{"text":"Snack bar quality! According to one in our party, the chicken was as good as the other review states. Carnitas good as well. Fish tacos...DRENCHED in grease...yuck!...heartburn. Nachos were okay, if you like cheese whiz. Typical glorified frozen food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is to expensive I got a quesadilla and burritos of Asada the meat was all burn!!!! and I got 5 tacos of Asada 2 drinks spend over $50"}
{"text":"A step or two above Del Taco. Would have been a lot better if food was hot especially As long as it took to get it"}
{"text":"It's not a Mexican restaurant, it's not taco bell...maybe something in between. It's not bad, but it's not great.  For the strip, the price is reasonable. If you are at the adventure dome it's right outside."}
{"text":"the food  was terrible. overly salted and  over priced. all the food in circus circus is pretty awful. take yourself to the strip to eat and avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I wasn't so sure about trying this place after I saw it only had 2 stars, but decided to take a chance. Hubby & I had the supreme nachos and they were some of the best nachos we've ever had. The shredded beef was tender & tasty and there was a ton of cheddar & Jack cheese on every layer of chips. They were topped with black olives, pico de gallo, sour cream & guacamole. There is a salsa bar which we took full advantage of.  I don't know about any of the other dishes, but I definitely recommend the supreme nachos."}
{"text":"It seems that this place gives false advertising.  By looking at the menu outside with the pictures I saw some street tacos that I decided to order.  But when I placed my order the lady seemed like she didn't know what I was talking about. When I got my order, they were just regular tacos.  I was disappointed, but when I ate them they were pretty good.  It's not authentic Mexican food.  But if you're on the go, on a budget, and need a decent meal, this is a good place."}
{"text":"This place was no good! To start the service was crappy. The ladies in the front rushed you to order and still gave a little attitude when you asked questions. The salsa and veggies in the salsa bar looked like it had been sitting there for a couple of days. The food was sucky too. The tortillas were falling apart, they clearly weren't heated up correctly and they were gross. We had shrimp tacos, menudo, and a carnitas plate. All three were just not good. No real flavor and the presentation was a mess! Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have stayed in Circus Circus so many times and seen this restaurant but I read the reviews and was a little put off..this time I decided to take a gamble because we wanted to try so thing different. Honestly our experience was pretty good, I was not highly impressed but the flavors were pretty good.  You walk up to the counter and order and they give you a buzzer with your drinks and you sit down and wait for the buzzer to go off. Once it does, you pick up your food. The menu items are limited to tacos, salads, enchiladas, chimichangas and a few soups. I believe I saw deserts too.  I ordered the Iguana chicken bowl which was pretty flavorful and was packed with black beans(my favorite), also rice, cheese and Pico de gallo. My daughter got two tacos al pastor. We had a coupon for free chips and salsa, the chips were n honestly quite good. Will definitely be coming back because overall, it was quite nice. 2 tacos al pastor, one iguana bowl, 2 drinks were 25 dollars, not cheap but still affordable. :)"}
{"text":"Food was bad, made my son sick all night. I had to take my taco back 2x because it was wrong and then so soggy I could not pick it up. My daughter could not finish the albondigas soup because it was so bad. Everyone claimed the food was the worst Mexican food they had eaten. The enchilada sauce was like ketchup and the albondigas was like watery tomato soup with a meatball."}
{"text":"We loved our food. Very fresh like they said. Great fast food. Great place to eat at Circus Circus! Love to come again."}
{"text":"If your looking for real authentic Mexican food this is not the place to go. This is out the box from your local food store (frozen food section) I was very disappointed due to advertising flyers having mouth watering pictures. I ordered the deluxe nachos and the cheese was not even melted. Never will eat here again. False advertising!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito but to get meat it had to be upgraded to the \"Ultimate\". This place is what you'd expect from the dumpsters of Taco Bell.  The flour tortilla was a cross between cardboard and turtle shell. Ok, enough compliments...  Avoid unless it's your last option."}
{"text":"Ordered the Asada plater, and a deep fried chicken taco. The rice is absolutely horrible, but the beans are amazing. The food was pretty good except for one chunk of my asada that was blood red raw. I ate the rest of my food happily and wasn't looking for compensation. I showed the head chef as well as the manager after my meal the piece and suggested they should probably check their food before they send it out, so people don't get sick. The manager was very considerate but the chef rolled his eyes with a slight smile on his face like I was stupid. I've worked with food for over twenty years and that's pretty sad when a chef thinks his food is always perfect. I would eat here, but just make sure you check your grub"}
{"text":"Nothing express about this place. 30 minute wait in line and then when I got to the front was told it would be another 20-30 minutes wait for two quesadillas. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Terrible taste! Not authentic Mexican that's for sure! Oil needs to be changed in fryer. Tortilla chips in nachos taste disgusting. Guacamole and sour cream are not like any other Mexican restaurant I've eaten at. Soft drink is 16oz for $4.06."}
{"text":"Food was nasty very low quality food. Cashier was rude. I would never go back there to eat."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you like real tacos, unless the only taco place you've been to is taco bell. Go to tacos El Gordo only like 10 minutes away walking. This place is Way over priced!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm staying at Circus-Circus this week and trying a few of their restaurants. I'm super-picky about chicken, especially at random Mexican joints and even more so in a tourist filled atmoshphere. My chicken has to be white meat and if they can stew it and it becomes shredded even better. THis actually is pretty rare (at least in Vegas) and I wasn't expecting much after watching a plate of nachos come out of the kitchen with that heavy cheese wiz sauce drenched on top of the chips. Ok, so 3 tacos are only $6 bucks and I went with soft shells and oh what a surprise and great value. THe chicken was stewed in the traditional mexican sauce of tomatoes and other spices and there were chunks of white chicken and shredded chicken overflowing on my three huge soft corn tortillas - yes soft corn. THe tacos were adorned simply with lettuce and shredded cheese, but the flavor of the meat was so good that i couldn't get enough. On my second night there, I tried the guac and all sides are just $1. The guac was chunky and had tomatoes and scallions and it was nice and cold and the chicken was equally good that night as well. This is solid homemade stuff and a shocking find for any fans of good Mexican cooking. Oh, its on the Adventuredome (promenade) level and the cashier is also really nice who takes your order."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the proportion of food but it's actually good. The ultimate burrito wasn't big but very delicious  churros was good too."}
{"text":"The cashier is fucking stupid messed up all 4 orders then I finally talk to the manager as I'm getting my food cause the total still didn't add up and the cashier but in I was not talking to you bitch  shut your mouth! Worst service ever bad customer service"}
{"text":"Eating here was kind of like my experience at the aria. Nothing special but seriously a little less refried  beans please for the taco salad"}
{"text":"give the choice between this Taco Bell... I'd take Taco Bell any day of the week.  The food was Hot, but that's really it.  and I don't mean spicy, I mean tempture wise.   The chips were about a day shy of stale, and the carne asada was so tough I could hardly bit all the way through it.   For Las Vegas being known for their quality cusine, this is a BAD example.   I don't think my husband and I will be staying at Circus Circus ever again, so hopefully we won't be forced to eat here again."}
{"text":"I guess we had a different experience than the last few reviewers. The food was awesome and the staff there were great to us. The chicken quesadilla was very tasty and the lady we ordered from was very helpful and funny!  We would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed rushed and careless.  The tables and floors were dirty.  There was a puddle of 'who-knows-what' coming from the trash can.  The food was very non-descript.  For the price, I was expecting the food to be much better."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant on our way out of AdventureDome. It was...I think the worst Mexican food we 've ever eaten. Hubby had Carne Asada plate. The carne asada was so dry and they didn't even bother to cut the meat into smaller piece. Just one big slab of dry meat. I had the Carnitas Burrito. That burrito had sooo much rice inside and they left the Carnitas on side of plate, not inside the burrito. Only good thing was that horchata was refillable.  I give this place a Whopping Two Stars!"}
{"text":"This place was seriously terrible.  Gluten-free note: What SHOULD have been gluten-free gave me a reaction. Do not come here.   Price: 2 Ambience: 1 Service: 0 Food: 1  It's hard to be critical, but this place really is just bad. There wasn't anything good about this experience and the service was SO bad, she sounded like a 12-year old with her first job and couldn't do anything right. At all."}
{"text":"Just horrible!  After hours with the kids at Adventuredome, we had worked up quite an appetite. Not wanting the typical carnival food being served there, but also wanting to return to more fun at the Adventuredome, we decided on this place since it was inside Circus Circus.   Please slap me if I EVER try a new place without reading some Yelp reviews first. Had I done so, I would have gone back inside for a burger and fries. All of the horrible reviews you're reading are true!   I had the  Iguana Chicken Bowl. The pico de gallo was the only thing I actually liked in the bowl. The chicken was dry. The beans were clearly from a can and the rice was completely lacking flavor.  My son had the shredded beef tacos. They were full of fat chunks and looked disgusting.   Those in my party who had the shredded beef burrito thought it was good, but I suspect that the flavor was enhanced by the extra $1.99 I paid for guacamole to be added to the burrito.   The guacamole! They were selling it with a few tortilla chips for FIVE DOLLARS!!!! Not a nice big bowl of it. No. A tiny plastic cup of it. Barely larger than the cups they give you at Pollo Loco for salsa.   FIVE DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!  You've got to be kidding me.   And if all of that isn't enough for you to walk away from this place, the service was not friendly and the food took FOREVER to be prepared. I'm willing to wait for a decent meal, but if a dining establishment is going to serve SLOP, I expect the food to be ready in under 15 minutes.   Heed my warning! You're better off at Taco Bell !"}
{"text":"Descent, not anything fantastic but wait time isn't bad at all. Almost everything is a la carte and burritos, tacos ect... don't come with any sides and they charge for chips and salsa. It's also counter order and pick up no table service. Salsa bar would be nice if they kept it clean and items full stocked."}
{"text":"Long ass review sum: DO NOT EAT HERE. Unless you want food poisoning.  Came here to eat last night because we were headed to Adventuredome and figured we would grab something near there. First of all the selections at Circus Circus are minimal. We settled on this place. Literally stood in line for 35 minutes. Got our food about 15 minutes later.   Chips and salsa- 4.99 for this. The \"hot\" salsa tasted disgusting, and they literally give you about 15 chips.  Not worth it at all.  Burrito Grande- all I could taste in it was cheese, hardly any rice or beans in it. I only ate a few bites.  3 deep fried tacos- guess it was the only thing at our table that was edible. Bf said he wouldn't eat it again though. More of a survival eating lol.  Rolled tacos- this was for the kids. My daughter took a bite and spit it out and said it was disgusting. She usually loooooves taquitos. My son (2) took a bite and said it was fish. I told him it was chicken. Bf tried it and spit it out and said the chicken is old. I smelled it and omg it smelled disgusting. We felt so bad for giving it to our kids. I went to the front and they asked if I wanted to order something else...ummm no thanks.. Not trying to up our odds of getting food poisoning at this restaurant. They ended up giving us $10.25 refund (we also added the rice and beans to it).  My son who ate a couple bites was up all night gagging. Please avoid this place like the plague. Even if you are on the tip of death from starvation, I would suggest eating out of a dumpster before you eat at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst tacos I have ever had, and extremely overpriced. I'm aware that the prices for things inside the casinos is more expensive, but you at least hope that the food will taste good. Don't waste your money here, go across the street for delicious street tacos for a 1/4 of the price."}
{"text":"Had Chicken nachos and Chicken Burrito. And the Chicken tasted more like Chicken of the Sea. Very watery with a tuna like texture. All other aspects were good, but I'd suggest avoiding the \"Chicken\""}
{"text":"This is very good the only things is that they don't have free water and they only have one size soda. But other than that it was great."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely awful, the workers take their time and do not seem to understand that people are waiting in line for 45 minutes. Nothing express about it. Doesn't even deserve one star"}
{"text":"This was pretty good for a pretty decent price and we did not have to leave Circus Circus. We ordered deluxe nachos, two carne asada tacos, cheese quesadilla, two beef sopes and two drinks for about $42. My kids ate everything."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. They're slow and unorganized. I rate it a 2 because the food is good otherwise it'd be a 1 at best.  But the service is not about the customer. We saw what seemed to be a manager poke their head out, see its busy and disappear please."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative I would. The food is disgusting. We took maybe two bites and threw it all away. The chicken enchiladas were disgusting and the chips were stale. Mexican rice was not cooked all the way. Had to try it once but will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Located inside circus circus hotel. Some distance away from the arcade area. What a disappointment. Not sure if the food served here classified as Mexican food.  I ordered the  -Deluxe Nachos with shredded beef $9.99 I was sad upon seeing what they call a \"Deluxe Nachos\", like the saying goes \" where's the beef\"? They were Stingy on the cheese,  it was cold, dried. I had two bites, pushed the plate aside. Thought what a waste of $10 Hubby had the Ultimate Burrito with shredded pork $9.49 I had a few bites, it was flavorful. Needless to say  he finished his burrito.  I also ordered 2 carne Asada $6.49 , steep if you ask me. It's better tasting than the nachos.  Extra charge for condiments $1-$2"}
{"text":"This was the WORST Mexican food my husband and I have ever had.  It would be slightly more forgivable if the restaurant were in, say, Pennsylvania, but Las Vegas is about as far West as you can get!  We both got burritos chimichanga style, which just meant there was some sort of bland, bright red, ketchup-looking sauce dribbled on top.  My husband didn't even finish his chicken burrito, which we both noted was a first.  But nothing tops (or bottoms?) the chips and salsa, which, in my opinion, is pretty hard to mess up.  My husband describes the chips as what you might find in an expired bag sitting in the back of a shelf at a 99 Cents store (not good enough for Dollar Tree, he says).  I would just describe them as cardboard.  Needless to say, we were sorely disappointed by the entire experience!  We thought about standing outside the entrance for 5-10 min, warning people to go somewhere else as a service to humanity, but decided we weren't going to waste any more of our time on that place!"}
{"text":"So this review is definitely late, I stayed at circus circus back in June 2016 for EDC that year & let me tell you...I still think about my meal to this day.  Now first let me give you some back story. I'm Hispanic, I grew up a stones throw away from the border & my abuela on my fathers side was from Mexico & her food was the absolute best. Even people not related to her said so! So the food I'm going to review is not the typical basic Starbucks girl meal level of food, because that is not what I ate while there. Though I would like to note that that is what I saw most people ordering (things like burrito bowls & nachos).  The first good sign while I waited in line, all the ladies in the kitchen were older, brown skinned & speaking to each other in Spanish. Next, they had jarritos sodas on ice. And finally as I looked over the menu I saw Menudo & Elote (Mexican Street corn). And that is exactly what I ordered. And as I ordered it, the young brown lady behind the counter gave me that special grin/nod of recognition & I returned it.  Anyone familiar with menudo whose had a long night of drinking can tell you that a bowl of it the following morning is a life saver. And although I do not drink & rave, my body still felt like utter crap (I'm already a month away from being 30 by this point ok). Guys, that bowl of menudo legit breathed new life into me. The carne was so tender & juicy, the broth was the perfect level of greasy & had that beautiful pungent flavor that, when others make it, it can sometimes lack. The only drawback was they had no freshly cut jalapeño (this is why my rating is 4 stars instead of 5), it was canned. Thankfully though there was freshly cut onion, cilantro & lime. Despite lacking the fresh jalapeño, the menudo was still bomb AF & remains to this day, some of the best menudo I have ever had. I honestly can't remember if my corn tortillas were freshly pressed or not, but they were still very tasty.  The elote was great, but I'm not going to lie, it was my first time having it. I've never had elote from a street vendor in Mexico, so if others find it lacking, my apologies. I will say however that I have since tried recreating the recipe, it is now a staple at family barbecues & it is loved by all. I paired all of that with an mandarin flavored jarrito & a water & after that I was good to go. Had an awesome nap back in my room & woke up ready & full of energy for EDC day (night) 2. I didn't have the energy to return in 2017 as the hotel I stayed in that year was further up the strip & it was just too much of a walk after a long night of raving...but I would definitely stay at circus circus again just to be in close proximity to the blue iguana."}
{"text":"Ughhhh...average quality with a high cost. The food was not bad by any means but for how much you have to pay, it is a little ridiculous. The fish tacos were actually pretty good. If you are looking for a quick fix and do not mind a high price it is a pretty easy place to go. I guess you pay for the convenience of it being in your hotel."}
{"text":"The food and service here are awful. The staff was rude and refused to give us a water cup. The only option is to buy a $4 water bottle... Now that is just crazy. If you must charge for water because too many people are getting water charge 50¢ or $1. The tacos were extremely greasy and very skimpy. The nacho chips were so hard I felt like my teeth were about to crack. The cheese wasn't even fully melted either. Very disappointed and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food EVER. Taco Bell is 100x better tasting. I ordered a taco salad with adobada. The adobada tasted nasty and was dry. There was literal lay 3 pieces of lettuce. Not exaggerating. Needless to say I didn't eat and threw it all away. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"If you think you're going to get Mexican food, go somewhere else now. I'm from Nor Cal so I think I've been spoiled with Mexican food. We went in here because we were REALLY hungry, there was a line so we thought it was good food. Ordered the chimichanga burrito and the regular chicken burrito. It took a while to get our orders since it was busy dinner time. I was standing at the counter and did realize that they put EVERYTHING in the microwave. We took it to go and when we go to our rooms we realized we hadn't gotten any chips or salsa, and biting into the burritos there was absolutely no flavor in the food. It was like they just through stuff together and hoped for a miracle. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for food...Gordon Ramsey would go crazy if he came in here..."}
{"text":"Very meh. Any average taco truck is twice as good and half as much. This place sucks."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has bad reviews we loved it. Here is what our experienced went...  Carnita taco $4.25... Taco had a lot of meat and he loved it. The price was outrageous for a small taco.  Nacho with shredded beef $10.50... That was the best nachos I have ever tasted. It was big enough for all of us.  Horchata $4.00.... It's not water down and tasted like a real horchata. Corona beer $7.00.... nice and cold   I give them 4 stars 1 minus for their ridiculous prices. I would come back if I'm around that area. Sherina was our cashier she was very friendly. Our total was $27.87."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. If it wasn't in order to write a review; I wouldn't even give a star. My boyfriend and I stayed at the circus circus for the first time and after 4 hours of driving we were both hungry and exhausted. We looked for a few options until we finally decided to try this place. Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.  I ordered fish and shrimp tacos, while he ordered pastor and asada. First of all the bill came out to be over $40.00 which I figured \"maybe it'll be worth it\"  BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!! For the fish tacos, the tortillas were cold it had a ridiculous amount of sauce and big chunks of tomatoes and onion. The fish it was like if they were just little pieces of those frozen fish sticks; It was just nasty.  For the shrimp tacos it only had like 3 to 5 tiny little shrimps, tortillas cold as ice as well.  Pastor and asada were both very fatty and oily.  \"Salsa bar\" was all dirty; all mixed\" Definitely never going back to that place.  If we stay at the circus circus once more, would so much rather go to the McDonald's upstairs."}
{"text":"Really no stars this place  charge me $26 for for tacos and ask for a cup of water they can't even give you a cup of water the cashier was rude and don't know her business I will never recommend coming here for a taco burrito even if you want some lettuce do not come to this place not good my cookies taste better then the food"}
{"text":"I mean the prices are really affordable but seriously? I ordered some chips & guacamole at $5.32 & they gave me this miniature container like those salsas containers with a bit of chips to the side. I was like is this a joke? I went back to complain if that was it & sadly it was so I just rolled my eyes & took it. Rip off!! As far as my food I ordered which was a burrito its okay if you're not expecting the real flavors of mexican food. I recommend it if you're hungry & it's your last resort. But don't order the chips it will disappoint you."}
{"text":"This place is ok nothing special about it. The food doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food but it's also not bad. Customer service is also ok the thing that I didn't  like is when they get very busy the cashiers are very slow at taking the orders so you wait a while in line."}
{"text":"Very poor quality amd poor services. They close the restaurant at 7 pm only. In Vegas who can have dinner before 7 pm. They dont care. Very limited selection."}
{"text":"The food was made to order, place is clean, staff is friendly. I had the fish Tacos, they were delicious. The only thing I would recommend is a salsa bar but other than that I had a experience eating here."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. We order $65 worth of idk trash because thats were $50 worth went. The only thing we enjoyed were our Margaritas. I've been staying here since I was a kid and always walked right pass this place as many others always do now I know why."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this restaurant, the food took forever, the self serve salsa area was so nasty, dirty & Empty as well. I ordered Fish Taco and it was so nasty I ended up throwing it away, the only thing that I as good was my bottled water. They definitely need a good leader in this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service . I asked if the tacos contained onions or tomatoes the girl at the register said no . I bit into my taco to right away receive onions and tomatoes. I took back the tacos and told them I didn't want onion or tomatoes and that's why I had asked . The girl went to the back then came back saying the only meat that doesn't have onions was in the rolled taco. So I said ok I'll have those instead .I bite into it and to my surprise onions and tomatoes AGAIN! So I tried eating just my beans and rice , that wasn't very great either not very authentic ."}
{"text":"My only complaint is them not opening on time. The website says they open at 11am but they didn't open until 12:10. The food was good. Nice place to chill while the kids played in the adventuredome. We had pork on our nachos. Pork was REALLY good! *Please put appropriate shows on the tv in the dining room. You cater to families, so the tv shouldn't be on Super Natural or CSI, which are both graphic and not family friendly."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Low cost alternative if willing to sacrifice quality and taste in order to save.  Had the Ultimate burrito.  Not as big as expected for the price.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"Had the supreme nachos with the shredded beef here. 5 minutes later, I end up with a case of cold sweats and the food poisoning has began to run its course. I Had to purge to feel human again. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"The nachos where very good nice thick chips so they didn't get soggy only complaint was only having one register open with several people in line and having workers standing starring at us while we wait in line"}
{"text":"Pretty Sure that they're cooking for a retirement home the food is SOOOO bland. I spent 10.50 on nachos that I didnt even eat half of because even salt and their flavorless salsa couldnt help. Their service is horrible. I probably wouldnt have came here if I had read the reviews before hand because they're super accurate."}
{"text":"It's just okay! The people are super friendly but as a person who makes really good Mexican food it's harder to eat this food. It's not authentic BUT it is in a good location and when you're drinking it's perfect. They have a salsa bar too. I would recommend it if you are in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Worst food for the price got two shrimp tacos and loaded nachos 25.00 asked for water they offered me bottled water for 3.75 they didn't even have a cup for water for the price of the food that would of been nice, the workers were loud and goofing off it was very unpleasant"}
{"text":"Of course, when you look at it you think this place is going to be bland & not have any flavor. I ordered the nachos and they were Delicious!!!! They were so gooood. I was surprised. This place has good food. They need more salsa choices but overall pretty great. Check it out."}
{"text":"I came here on 7/11/12. My family and I were so hungry after hanging out with the kids at Adventure Dome in Circus Circus.   I ordered the Enchilada supreme. It was good but not enough to fulfill my hunger. The serving was very small. If I ordered 2 enchiladas, it would cost around $12-$15.   The employees were nice and polite but the food just didn't meet my standards."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, half my order was wrong or messed up, then the lady behind the counter argued with me about it being wrong.  Once we finally got it all situated the food was blah....Not even close to authentic, borderline cold, chips were stale, cheese hardly melted.    For as expensive as this place was it was not even close to being worth it.  Wont go back"}
{"text":"I came here because I had a coupon for free chips & salsa with $10 coupon.  I got a chimichanga. It wasn't horrible but it was LOADED with red sauce. Way too much! Made it very soggy. Meat was also tough and not flavorful. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at the Circus Circus in Vegas and took a chance on The Blue Iguana. We ate there twice and found the food to be good. I am not saying it is worth taking a drive to eat here, but if you are staying at the Circus, it is convenient. I saw a lot of reviews that were critical but we had their Grande Burrito,  Ultimate Burrito and Cheese Enchilada and found them quite passable. They won't make you forget your abuelita's food, but for the price, we would go again. The girl taking the orders was helpful and friendly, the place was clean and had decent decor. We went before 5:30 and almost had the place to ourselves. Later in the evening it got much busier. We received a coupon for free chips and salsa when we checked in. The plate of chips was fresh and warm and the salsa bar had a small selection of salsa and sliced jalapenos."}
{"text":"The food is good, just a small portions given. Which is not really worth it for the price you pay for. It was late and did not feel like driving so we just decided to eat here. The staff are okay, there is not much on the salsa bar. My friend order a posole yet they did not have onions or cilantro to put on it. Its a meh place."}
{"text":"Wasnt what i was expecting. All the advertisement i thought it was a restaurant where you sit and you have a waitor or waitress. All the pics look amazing. The lady at register is an airhead our first thing we ordered was 2 fish tacos she took like 5 minutes doing that. Finally we gave the rest of our order. Not a fan of shredded food but i gave it a try. We ordered an elote, Rolled beef tacos, quesadilla, and the fish tacos. They were ok. Was like a fast food mexican place."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family about a month ago and it was absolutely terrible.  Del Taco serves Mexican food more \"genuine\" than this place.  The beans were bland, the prices were not great and it was not a good experience overall.  The only thing giving this place 2 stars was its sanitation...very clean.  Other than that, my family will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We were scrambling around the circus circus hotel to find something to eat for dinner. We didn't want to wait in line for the buffet so we opted for this place instead.   As I walked into this place, I thought the food was going to taste average or horrible. I was totally wrong!   What we ordered: -drunken shrimp plate  The shrimp was cooked with tequila and you can taste the alcohol without it being too powerful. I was surprised at how huge the shrimp was! It came with rice, beans, and two warm tortillas.   -ultimate grande burrito  This was a wet shredded beef burrito with all the typical burrito fillings. The shredded beef was tender, moist, and flavorful!   -chimichanga The same thing as the ultimate grande burrito but deep fried and topped with a red sauce. Since it was fried, it was really greasy  and hard to eat :(  - 2 little amigos plate I love how they called it a 'little amigos plate' rather than the typical 'kids meal'! My siblings both had a ground beef soft taco that was bland. It came with rice, beans, and yummy flaky cinnamon sugar tortilla chips for dessert."}
{"text":"Meh... this is actually pretty bad-to-mediocre Mexican food. Giving it 2 instead of 1 because I got great service despite other reviews. I'd skip it."}
{"text":"You know what, for what it is, it was pretty good. Recognize that it's a fast food Mexican restaurant, but compare to a Taco Bell, this is gold!  We went because we had a coupon for free nachos and salsa. We ordered burritos with pulled pork. They were pretty alright, although the salsa really added to them.  Basically, for the price, I think it was alright. Considering we ate at Mexican restaurants on this trip that were three times the price but no better, I would say, for a quick meal, go for it!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  What Mexican restaurant runs out of sour cream?  Oh wait, the guy seated next to me and he had sour cream.  The lady taking my order was positive they were out of sour cream but wasn't, but by the time I saw my neighbor sit down with his meal and had sourcream on his plate, mine was halfway done. The food was on the cold side and not all that good.  It was overpriced.  Keep walking."}
{"text":"I got what I at first thought would be a small portion of food turns out to be a moderate amount. I got fish Baja tacos , nachos,  and cheese quesadilla.  I got a little suckered into making the small  nachos into a deluxe nachos. So it turned into quite a bit of food . It was good ,  my friend and I both enjoyed the food. Even had to take some with me. What do you expect from a chain food place"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. You are better off eating dog food or Taco Bell. Just turrible"}
{"text":"When I came in there were only 3 ppl before me. The place was empty. I only ordered a street corn...just one and that was as at 11:20am. It is now 11:38 and I still don't have my corn. At least 6 other ppl have come after me and some have food. For a to go order this is the longest and last time I will ever come to this place. Total waste of time...nearly 20min of waiting ...and still counting..."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed I even feel like this but they don't even deserve a 3 star. I ordered the chips and salsa, soft tacos, churro and burrito with chicken in it. The salsa was so bland-_-. I love Mexican chips and salsa and this has been the worst (maybe it was a bad batch) . It was also the only \"taco sauce\" offered for my soft tacos but the \"taco sauce\" was really the same as the \"salsa\". I asked the cashier for condiments like sour cream and was told it was in the bag along with the \"taco sauce (haha)\" , chips and salsa and sour cream. When I looked in the bag there was only \"salsa\" for my chips.-_-. So I went back to cashier and she tells me that they don't offer sour cream....um ok. It is what it is....at least everything else was positive outside of this place."}
{"text":"Was the worse Mexican food I've had in Vegas. El Monterey frozen taquitos, canned salsa and guac, yes the guac here has to be out of a can or container of some sort. The soup was tasteless. I dont think anything is made fresh here. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I went here with my meetup after we went to the AdventureDome and I ordered nachos.  These were the worst nachos I had ever ate.  The cheese was not melted all the way.  I also ordered tacos and they weren't very good either.  This is not the best Mexican Restaurant and I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! The place had food scattered all over the floor and the tables. The chicken is so bland and flavorless. Salsa was mediocre at best. My burrito was really undercooked. Super over priced. Took us 20 minutes for us to get our food with no one in front of us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Most def never again! The pictures they post throughout the hotel is very misleading. We decided to give it a chance dispite the reviews and yeah worst decision ever! Order the elote and it was just pure mayo and hardly any cheese or chili powder. Also got the tacos al pastor and it just tasted like those taco packets that you can buy at a store.. if you're desperate and hungry then I guess but other than that find a authentic taco place to eat at."}
{"text":"Good for fast food.  Super expensive for quick food of this caliber- but that what you get in this part of Vegas."}
{"text":"Had this while in Vegas. It was close to hotel and we didn't want to miss flight out. Had Nachos and cheese. Not bad.Chips were great and cheese used was plenty. They have stuff to the side like onions and jalepeno and salsa to spice it up. Also has two beef fried tacos. Little over cooked and meat had little taste to it. Wife had chicken taco and rice. 40 bucks total. Which isn't bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"Not even OK. We stopped in there to get something to drink and cool off. 5 of us ordered a margarita but what we got was unknown. It was cold but had nothing to do with a margarita. You could taste cinnamon and maybe coconut, they were an off white color and not good. These things had no lime anything in them at all. We took them back to the counter and the lady said it was a margarita and would not take them back or check her \"margarita\" machine to see if she made a mistake. We tried to drink them but they ended up in the trash. What a waste of a lot of money. I watched many other customers returning their food and drinks while we were there too. Not sure what the problem is in there but they need help."}
{"text":"Disgusting Mexican food. Over priced. Go to the Mexican restaurant behind the hotel. $8 for a bland burrito with extremely dry rice. Salsas all taste the same."}
{"text":"This place is terrible bad service and the food is gross our chicken in the nachos was cold and the taquitos tasted like frozen ones u pop in the microwave do NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. I had the rolled tacos and chips with guacamole. It was all really delicious and I would go again. The only strange thing is my friend asked for a water cup and they said they do not give out water cups. If you want water, you have to buy bottled water."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on Valentine's day it was awesome! I ordered a pork chimichanga and it was so good and big I shared with my husband. He order a chicken quesdilla it was pretty good. A friend order beef tacos he said they we're good."}
{"text":"Over priced and needs some seasoning. 'nuff said. If you need some food, eat it. If you want some good food, go elsewhere, like the pizzeria. If you want REALLY good food, leave the parking lot."}
{"text":"Pretty bad... not even close to mexican food... However, if you are used to tex-mex... this will do..."}
{"text":"Tables are filthy - no one wipes them even after complaints- food tastes mediocre and took a long time"}
{"text":"All I can say is that we were starving and needed some heavy food to prepare us for a night on the town. Their food is pretty bad and I'm for certain that my burrito was cooked in a microwave and then smothered with red sauce. The beans they use are definitely canned and probably the cheapest you can buy. I don't know what kind of  beans they were but they were a weird brownish gray color and I picked them out of my burrito. Most Mexican places use refried beans. This place they were whole and undercooked. Yikes! We were lucky that we didn't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"All right food when you're really hungry!  Its like a step up from Taco Bell.  I got the chicken taco salad and a drink for about $10.  Didn't really like the cornucopia of food but the crispy bowl was pretty good.  So basically, I can make this at home except I don't have a deep fryer to make the bowl. Also, the chicken texture reminded me of canned tuna."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star then I would. I ordered the salad bowl with added chicken, and when I received it I knew it looked a little off. I decided to try it anyway even though it didn't look very appealing. Right off I noticed that the chicken tasted reheated and the corn tasted like it was cooked DAYS ago. When I spit it out the corn that was mixed in my chicken, it was turning brown. The black beans are clearly canned and they didn't even have the decency to heat them all the way up. Not to mention how over priced the food is. About 2 hours later I had a headache and was sick to my stomach. Now it's the next day and I haven't been able to eat anything and stuck on the toilet with the runs! Please do yourself a favor, DON'T EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the deluxe nachos with carne asada to split as a snack with me and the family. Absolutely delicious. My Mexican wife said it was the best nachos she ever had! Will definitely be back when we come here again!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is more mexican than this place. Subpar service, good luck finding a place to sit. Limited menu and prices are way more than what you should pay for this food. Its pretty gross. Made us sick. Quesadilla with cold unmelted cheese inside?? yuck! Thought you couldn't go wrong with nachos and ordered that with the carnitas. Meat was cold. Thoroughly enjoyed my ice cold Corona. Find yourself a TacoBell instead."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! The stupid girl at the register put through all 4 of our orders incorrectly. Then the girl argued with my friend for 10 min when she had already overcharged her!! Worst customer service! Its not that hard to key in a quesadilla!"}
{"text":"This was some bs! Coming from lb ca where theres a delicious Mexican restaurant in every local area this didn't even stack up against a faux Mexican spot like Taco Bell.  This crap was unnecessarily expensive (1 dry burrito, sloppy 4 tacos with over cooked meat, 3 small sodas 45$ w/o tip) and basic customer service was WHACK.  Only decent thing was unlimited non alcoholic drinks.    The advertisements make you think it's the bomb, but sorry it's sub par at best.  The restaurant wasn't even all that clean.  I'm thoroughly surprised considering the steak house inside of circus circus is top notch.  Guess you can't assume."}
{"text":"Waiters/Servers were sweet, but the food was bad! Had nachos, shrimp tacos and enchiladas.  Wouldn't visit again... Salsa bar wasn't kept clean , and every sauce tasted similar. Beans were too pasty."}
{"text":"Wow... If I could rate a half star I would.   Food is bad.. I mean reaaaaalllllly baaaaaaaddddd.   Service was a joke.   The hostess messed up the check twice and I am in line to try and fix the second mess up as we speak.  She seemed to not care and argued with me about the second mistake. They also shorted me a taco which was easy enough to fix at least. Also.... Waaaaaaaaaay overpriced.  Also... Just wanted water as I had been flying all day and was dehydrated so the charged me 3.50 per cup for the family.   Other option was bottles of Aquafina for 4.00.  That is just greed and has nothing to do with service.    In the end the manager worked with me to resolve the billing issue to my satisfaction.  He seemed to want to try and run a  decent ship but judging from the hostess at the front counter,  that seems like an up hill battle.  Good luck to him.    Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Te food is just that \"A-OK!\" It'll do you after a long trek at the Adventuredome. Don't expect fancy or disgusting greasy food as its far from both of those. Nor is it authentic or honest Mexican Food. Its Fast Food with a slight \"Gourmet\" Atmosphere and Flavor. I liked it. I got a simple bean burrito. I thought it prices were fairly decent for being in Las Vegas. The place was so busy, but they got the food out pretty quickly"}
{"text":"We ordered the deluxe nachos pork carnitas, i also had a coupon for free chips and salsa . Nachos were really good and big portion about $10.79, omg their salsas all 3 of them were good."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't the best Mexican food I have ever tasted.  It was okay.  It wasn't \"authentic\" as advertised either."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I wouldn't really care to go back. It's just a fast food Mexican restaurant. If you are spending time in Vegas, there are so many other places you could go to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the very few instances in which I didn't look at the yelp reviews before I walked in. I came in on a hungry evening and ordered some carne Asada fries with the guacamole on the side. That day I could've sworn to you that those were the best fries I had ever had! The portion was nice, cheese was good, fries were crispy, I had absolutely so complaints!   The next day, my friend and I were hungry for some more, so we went back. Ordered the exact same thing, except this time the portion was humongous and the guacamole was different. It was strange and we both noticed. That's when we both realized that we must have been starving the night before because there wasn't anything impressive. I still give it four stars because there isn't any other cheap Mexican place in the vicinity of the hotel, that I could find.   The staff was nice and the place was clean too."}
