{"text":"Salads are good, as is the chili. ( most likely the fastest food you'll get there too)

They need to get new buns for their burgers as they are too big for the patty.

My biggest problem is they need to work on time management.

When my lunch is only 30 mins long, and it takes you 30+ mins to make a hamburger that's a bit ridiculous.

When you have 3 people in your kitchen you need to delegate things to get things done faster so not everyone is waiting forever.

OR TELL PEOPLE ITS GOING TO TAKE FOREVER! So they aren't wasting their time.

The wait is NOT worth it....

Lastly, Don't be greedy with your refills....its costing you cents...."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would.  This is the most in depth review I will probably ever do on Yelp.  This place needs to have some negative reviews, maybe the owner will finally get the hint that this place is horrible.

This place is LITERALLY in an office building across from Tempe Diablo Stadium, so they're guaranteed a steady crowd of people from all of the different businesses that are spread about the large office area.  I can only assume the owner is resting on this fact and therefore doesn't care about his product.

First, they advertise that they use Boar's Head meats.  Great, except all of the other ingredients on their sandwiches/wraps are old and not fresh.  The bread is very subpar, cheap stuff.  The tomatoes and lettuce are wilted and taste awful.  There are several employees who make the sandwiches and each one makes each sandwich their own way.  Some do a pretty good job, while some of them put your sandwich together like they can't wait to go home.  The wraps are the same, tortillas are horrible awful foul tasting store bought flaps.  Finally, the salads are disgusting.  90% lettuce, and I'm not talking about leaves, more of the stalks of lettuce.  They are watery, and again all of the veggies are old and foul.  All of the dressings are clearly from a giant tub somewhere in the back room.  So, I am flunking the \"Deli\" part of the Deli & Grill name of this dump.

Second, the grill.  Oh boy where do I begin with this grill?  They offer about 5 different kinds of hamburgers, deep fried stuff and some \"Mediterranean\" selection.  This is NOT a grill.  This place grills ALL of their hamburgers for the day at 9am and then puts them in a refrigerator.  When you order a burger, you can watch the grill cook grab your already cooked patty out of the refrigerator and place it on to the griddle.  This makes for a disgusting dried out burger.  Once again, all of the toppings are disgusting and wilted.  The grill cook must be afraid of serving undercooked food, because everything that he sends out of that pickup window is \"well done\".  I ordered a \"Gryro's\" (this is how it's spelled on the menu) and watched him take the fake gyro meat chunks (I didn't expect anything better) and cook them on the griddle under a grill smasher for 15 minutes.  It was black and hard as a rock when I got it.  Think burnt Spam.  You can tell he cuts corners on EVERYTHING and takes no pride in the food he puts out.  Therefore, this place cannot be called a \"Grill\" either.

The employees are ALL rude with the exception of one or two.  None of them have a sense of urgency in whatever they're doing.  Even the polite one or two take no pride in their work, and just do enough to get by.  I really hate going to establishments where every single person is just doing the bare minimum.  As I mentioned, this place is in an office building, so most people are on break, or have to get back to work, but this doesn't faze them.  They will take their time no matter what you order.  Sometimes, depending on what you order, the cashier or cook will actually have a bad attitude or tell you no!  You can't order from the lunch menu in the morning, unless you're very nice to all of the employees.  I watched one employee tell a female coworker of mine no to something and then tell me yes 30 seconds later.  She didn't know the other person was my friend.  In a business that succeeds, you never say no to a customer.  It's infuriating just thinking about the terrible attitude of that one particular employee who I've seen say no to so many people.  

Finally, this place has gotten my order wrong and/or lost my ticket SEVERAL times.  I've ordered food and sat right in front of the cashiers for 30 minutes waiting for something as simple as a BLT and no one asks the cooks what's up with the order.  Please wrap your mind around this situation: they have TWO registers, each one numbers your order from 01 to 99 and then restarts.  At several times a DAY the two registers are pumping out the SAME ORDER NUMBER to the SAME ticket machine!  This means, when they call #55, there's a very good chance someone else will walk up to the pickup window and take your food.  This has happened to me twice.  I then have to argue with the cook or the confused older lady that she gave my food to someone else.  They have been there for over a year and it still happens every day.  Oh, and I NEVER get an apology for these mix ups.  I've had SEVERAL coworkers here in my building state the same thing, that they simply lost their order.  I spent a lot of money in this establishment since it's been open, and to be consistently let down, have orders forgotten, etc. is unacceptable.  

Here's their last inspection:

{"text":"I work in this building so it's pretty convenient for me to pick up a quick meal. The food is good, and the daily specials are awesome! The staff is always very nice and the food is ready pretty quick. I just wish they were open later than 4pm :("}
{"text":"New owner Romeo is excellent!  Very convenient for anyone that works in this tech building."}
{"text":"I tried this place last year, now 6 months later I tried it again.  It still has slow unprofessional staff.  The food is still bad and low quality.  I'll never be back."}
{"text":"My expectations were exceeded by this place. The staff is super friendly and the prices are very fair. They are a bit slow during peak times during lunch (12 - 1) but if you go just before or after the rush its pretty quick."}
