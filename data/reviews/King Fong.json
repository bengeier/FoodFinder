{"text":"UPDATE (2/14/13):  I haven't been back to King Fong in a year or two.  Unfortunately, my fiance got food poisoning the last time he was there.  I also noticed the cleanliness of the place declining (employees snapping off vegetable stems right in the front \"dining room,\" while also playing on their iPhone).  It really disappointed me, because I used to love it.  Haven't been able to find a place since that really compares.  If anyone learns if this place gets back on track, let me know!  =========== It's basically your typical, greasy Chinese take-out, but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find a Chinese place in the Lakewood area that doesn't taste like garbage.  King Fong is our go-to restaurant.  They're open till 10 PM on Sundays, 10:30 PM on weekdays, and 11:30 PM on Saturdays.  I also love that they deliver, something I never experienced with Chinese food till I moved up here -- I'd been exposed to dine-in or take-out only.  It is about 15-20 minutes faster if you go and order the take-out, though.  We always try to order within at least 45 minutes of their closing, but they seem to take take-out orders up until the last 15 minutes or so.  There is always someone on the phone ordering when we go in to pick up our dinners.  And, if you order a certain amount of food, you get free drinks.  The prices are pretty average, and they offer 2 sizes of most entrees.  The fried wontons are the best.  I always get the chicken lo mein made spicy, and I love that there are no mushrooms in it.  A lot of the dishes have a good portion of veggies in them, too, so I try not to feel so bad about eating it.    Obviously, this isn't the place to come if you're looking for a gourmet experience.  But for solid Chinese take-out, it's one of the best places around."}
{"text":"Ordered here a week ago chicken wasnt cooked all the way the sauce was gross, whole experience was gross never again."}
{"text":"fast and it tasted fresh. I ordered king pao chicken and it was delicious and I'm super picky with Chinese. The egg roll wasn't anything to write home about but other than that I was impressed. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The best take-out Chinese food on the West Side. Great prices, huge portions and soooo tasty. Their boneless spare ribs are so tender and juicy. Their egg rolls are the best I've ever had. I have moved farther away, but I still make the drive to go to King Fong."}
{"text":"A local favorite for the West Siders, most definitely. This place have been around town for awhile now, I believe more than 20 years. The food is good if you're in the mood for some Chinese food. I went here after my boyfriend recommended this place because he used to go here when he was a kid with his family. The only place around that makes some tasty Pineapple Chicken and the portions are generous. The prices are reasonable and if you're looking to come to dine in, I wouldn't recommend it since this is merely just a take out place. Luckily, this place had some authentic dishes so it's convenient for those who don't want to take the drive downtown. Their Singapore style pan fried noodles was good and plentiful for just one person. If you know what's authentic, then you have no problem picking out the ones that are.   We went there to order in person since we were coming back from our day of shopping so I'v never experienced their take out so I can't say if that is bad. If I'm in the area visiting the boyfriend's parents place, I'll try and see since it's not that far away."}
{"text":"We opted to pick our meal up so I won't hit on the delivery experience.  Ugh. I've gotta stop eating this shit. Don't get me wrong, I love the occasional \"everything's fried, covered in sugar sauce and completely devoid of anything resembling authentic Chinese cuisine\" over indulgence, but I just had such a below average experience with King Fong I'm sorta turned off with the whole thing.  First off, let me start by saying that King Fong isn't really doing anything out of the ordinary when compared to its peer group (think Americanized asian take-out). Their menu is exactly the same as everyone else's - actually, when compared side-by-side with the likes of Oriental Palace Buffet, Spring Garden, and Ming Moon, it's hard to tell them apart. I'm pretty sure there's a turnkey \"start your own Chinese place\" catalog somewhere with all the goodies.  Anyway, here's what we ordered:  Pork Egg Roll - Your typical fried cabbage-filled gut bomb. I wasn't too keen on these. I found them to be bland and the specs of pink that littered the insides were pathetic excuses for meat.  Crab Rangoon - I guess I prefer my rangoon pinched at the top rather than the ravioli style that seems to be making its way around the take-out circuit here in Cleveland. The yellow dough was soft and unseasoned and the cream cheese middle was way too sweet. Oh yeah, crab? What crab?  Pork with Snow Peas - This was one of the biggest disappointments. Upon opening the container we were greeted with an inordinate amount of snow pease and bamboo shoots and only about 6 slices of pork. The mucus-like brown sauce was salty and the pork was like little pieces of pink-rinded shoe leather.  General Tso's Combo Platter - This dish is my go-to. Little bits of breaded and fried chicken covered in a sweet and spicy red sauce. You can't go wrong, right? This particular version with its chewy, fatty little chicken bits and underseasoned shellac was pretty blah. Isn't this dish supposed to have some heat behind it? The pork fried rice was a weird yellow color and they shouldn't have even bothered with the raw broccoli that came with it. That just insults the meat.  I really can't blame King Fong too much. After all, they are only catering to their market, right? They are serving pretty much the exact same food as everyone else. I just think I'm losing my taste for these psuedo-ethnic concoctions. For some reason, I always feel a little ill and slightly guilty whenever I have this kind of food. Sure it's cheap, but is it worth the calories? Maybe I'll stick with PF Chang's the next time I've got a craving for Asian.  P.S. No spring rolls? Really? I found this an annoying oversite.  We did get two free pops with our order. Anything over $15 qualifies."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese takeout. Generous portions, fast service. Prices are fair. Predictably good. I've probably been here 100 times and never disappointed. Boneless BBQ ribs are tremendous!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food with huge portions. I ordered the orange chicken for $9 and it's definitely for two people. I think all of their meals are like that. But it was good for the price!"}
{"text":"Bomb food every time. Always hot when delivered. Bomb authentic American style Chinese food!"}
{"text":"So far, The best around the West Park area. The prices are a little higher, maybe $.50-$.75, but the portions are more than generous and the food is excellently prepared. The reason I gave it five stars is not only for the quality of the food, but for the fact that I ordered vegetable my fun and it was NOT overloaded with broccoli, is would be the case in most Chinese takeout restaurants. They're terrific lunch specials offer you a choice of soft drink or soup in addition to the menu item and fried rice. All in all, a terrific place to go when you're craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"Cheap quick and never had a bad experience so that gets 4 stars.  Would have gave 5 stars but when ever I leave I smell of greasy food"}
{"text":"Well first off let me say I don't eat Chinese food. Ever. Ever. We just moved to lakewood so we figured we'd do what any couple would do when they first move into a house... Order Chinese food! We saw all the reviews on yelp and this was the best choice. It took about 40 minutes for delivery. I was surprised there was no chop sticks and the food wasn't delivered in those Chinese boxes. It kind of took the fun out of the experience. The food itself was warm but not hot but not cold. I wasn't a fan of the eggroll but my boyfriend liked them and he liked that they were a good size. Not a tiny eggroll. The food came with soy sauce and duck sauce packets ... 2 fortune cookies. Umm overall I guess, for Chinese, it was decent. I give it three stars but my boyfriend gives it four and said he'd order there again :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, and I have not died. Overall it's pretty good take out, at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food the best on West side."}
{"text":"Meh... Not awesome, not terrible... The bad: Delivery can be slow, which is annoying. English-speaking girl who answers phone is typically rude. Hunan sauce has a weird, vaguely urinal-cakey aftertaste.   The good: free soda (perfect with greasy Chinese food) if you buy $15 or more, the egg rolls are awesome, the fried tofu is good, but it's weird that, if you order anything with tofu, they will ask \"how much?\", and then they'll say \"how many dollars' worth of tofu do you want?\" It's not a good or bad way of measuring tofu, I guess, just strange..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite delivery Chinese restaurant of all time!! They are quick, consistent, and Good! Seriously, I'm picky about Chinese food. I know it's pretty much all the same, but does it have to be bad? King Fong says No! It does not. You will not find the exotic, but you will find all the standards, done well. Delivery is quick-- they say 45 minutes, but it usually is less. So, remember to tip your driver."}
{"text":"Pretty good and cheap fast delivery  rice is really bland but if ur hungry it does justice"}
