{"text":"Had a great meal  - the thai peanut pasta was wonderful. It's not the easiest to do take out (bring someone to jump out of the car and someone to circle) but it was worth it. The salad was also fresh and delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Have passed it many times but this is was the first time my husband and I actually tried it. We ordered the Truffle Bolognese and the Sweet Corn Pest with BBQ chicken based on yelp recommendations and neither did disappoint. The pasta was al dente and the sauces were delicious and just the right amount. Overall great service and great food!"}
{"text":"This is defiantly a must eat at Crocker Park. The pasta is amazing and perfectly cooked"}
{"text":"Pasta dishes are very tasty and creative. Been there three times and have enjoyed each selection. However, I have noticed, what seems to me to be a reduced amount of pasta being served in your bowl each visit. Combine that with the fact that some of the dishes can be as high as $9.50, I think they could do more business with a little lower price point and include a free refill with a soda purchase (they charge a dollar). Also to the dude in the kiosk, with the shirt that reads physco, we can read a menu and don't need you to try to upsell me a brownie, coffee or tea. I get it. And also, stop parking your white car in the reserved pasta co-op pick up spot! Us with small children may patronize your business more if we could call in an order, park and pick it up as planned without your car in the spot."}
{"text":"So good! Alfredo Chicken and Spicy Shrimp were both delic! Portions were good and tasty!  For sure coming back! In my opinion better than Piada."}
{"text":"hands down the best pasta I've had in the Cleveland area!! my favorite bowl is the sweet corn alfredo, the sauce is so flavorful! it's cool you can see them make the pasta and everything tastes so fresh. good portions for the price too! definitely want to try the seasonal flavors next time."}
{"text":"Pasta was great, flavor was great for a fast food kinda spot. The guys that took my order and gave me advice on what to order were fantastic!Great customer service, very personable. This place is such a niched find, made in house gourmet pasta and sauce. You guys should definitely come to Chattanooga Tenn and start a food truck, you would kill! If you do follow this advice remember Castwell!"}
{"text":"I love pasta co-op! Food was good service was great especially the girl working cashier named Brooke! She was so helpful in helping me decide what to order"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh pasta! The Mac & Cheese and Pomodoro were excellent and a perfect portion size. With great service and great food, I would recommend Pasta Co-Op to anyone!"}
{"text":"Visiting Crocker Park for the first time from NY and decided to try Pasta Co-op.   Pasta was cooked perfectly- firm but not rubbery.  I had the Alfredo, my husband had the bolognese and my daughter opted to mix/match her own creation.  Everything was tasty and well worth the price.  Dining outdoors and watching the people go by was great.   Nice place to visit and I'd definitely go back if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The people are wonderful and remember us every visit. The pasta bowls are to die for. ....important note: the spicy shrimp can be made non spicy. You can also build your own bowl. Did I mention my favorite is chicken and shrimp with Alfredo.  #definitionofsexy #delicious"}
{"text":"Would love to give them more stars, because the food was absolutely delicious, and the staff was very friendly (well the tall blonde guy was, however the other guy working, and the girl did not speak).

Anyway, I ordered my food at 7:29, printed on my receipt, and was told that it would be less than 10 minutes, fast forward to 7:44 when I finally received my meal.....I understand the pasta is cooked fresh, but I really feel they should make the pasta for each individual customer, instead of waiting for several orders before cooking the meals - would cut down on the first person's wait time."}
{"text":"Happy to find a vegan sauce option!
Delicious and fresh. Only a 5 minute wait for prep. 
Added onions, mushrooms, and peas... really good!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here, def need to try it, being an UberEATS delivery driver is how I originally discovered the place, and the food smells so good I was delivering o had to try it... The Sweet Corn BBQ is amazing ... prob my favorite, along with the Spicy Shrimp Alfredo .... the food is made fresh daily and it doesn't  disappoint"}
{"text":"awesome mac n cheese. you can tell the noodles are fresh and they're just amazing! the spicy shrimp was good too"}
{"text":"Pasta Co-op is a go-to place for legit pasta. Although inconveniently placed on the little food court area inside crocker park, it is worth the hassle to park and walk to the place. You'd be lucky if you find parking off street right next to it. The pasta variety keeps changing every once in a while, but the taste remains same.

They could do a little better with the portion size for the amount paid. Overall, a very good place and one of my favorites for pasta."}
{"text":"Pretty good pasta (and some sandwich options). Many options for vegetarians, non-red meat eaters, and even some vegan choices! About the same cost as everything else in Crocker other than the fast food."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. I wanted pasta and was in Crocker Park so I figured I would stop. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. The chicken was pre cooked and the entire meal was just bland. Yeah, I just didn't like it at all. Definitely a waste of $12 and I don't think I'll be back. I give them 3 stars because the customer service was great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and every single time it has been delicious. I love that the menu is small but no matter what you get you won't be disappointed. I love the Mac and cheese and the Alfredo pasta and I added chicken peas and mushrooms to it!"}
{"text":"The friendly guys at Pasta Co-op let us watch like giddy kids as they made our fresh pasta for delicious Mac & Cheese and Pomodoro. I could only eat half of my pasta bowl because it was so filling, but I'm looking forward to eating the rest for dinner! Tom and the guys let us taste test a new recipe that was fantastic; I can't wait until it's on the menu."}
{"text":"Bolognese is my favorite sauce and it's so hard to find some made without pork! I usually make it at home, but the process takes all day. I recently stumbled upon this place and found a turkey bolognese! I was so excited!! 


I absolutely loved their Turkey Truffle Bolognese. Their fresh pasta is topped with the delicious bolognese, cherry tomatoes, truffle oil, red onions, and Parmesan. 


Fresh ingredients and handmade pasta... what more could you ask for?!


I only wish the portions were a little larger. It's pretty expensive! But I'll definitely order it as a treat to myself when I'm able to!"}
{"text":"Working in Crocker park, I visit pasta co-op regularly where the food and service is always superb. Thomas and the rest of the staff each bring unique talent and provide world class service. Thom is always experimenting with the menu, creating new culinary experiences, which he and his staff deliver in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend trying one of his many pasta bowls, which come from house made pasta and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Just OK.  Cajun Shrimp pasta was definitely not worth $10 with only four shrimp and sauce from a bottle taste.  The Vermont Mac & Cheese at $8 was over priced as well and was not delivered with the originally pickup since they forget it was on the ticket. Had to wait additional time and was disappointed with the meal.

Staff was friendly, but for these prices the quality of the pasta needs to be better."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now and really enjoy their pasta choices. The portions are very large and the prices are great for how much you get. I usually make my own pasta but will definitely try others on my next visit. My only knock is I wish they had a whole wheat or multigrain pasta option. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving some pasta."}
{"text":"Great fresh made to order pasta, large portions and friendly staff.  And the best of all, we got to see pasta being made!"}
{"text":"Legit pasta. Good portion size (squeezed two meals out of it) & super flavorful. This is my new go-to spot at Crocker, no more of that crappy chain restaurant food!! Also happy there are vegan options for my partner to enjoy."}
{"text":"The mac&cheese is a favorite of my little one now. Get some for the family and I know you won't be disappointed. Co-op is Definitely great place to stop by and get dinner for the family on the way home!"}
{"text":"I wanted pasta so my husband and I saw this place at Crocker Park.  My choices were Brio or this new pasta place.  We decided to eat at the co-op.  $25.00 for two pasta bowls and two sodas.  I got Pomodoro and my husband got spicy shrimp.  I love pasta but not this pasta.  The turkey meatballs were good but the sauce was thick like tomato paste.  It tasted like it was burned.  I ate it as I was hungy and since I am not working I wasn't about to waiste dinner.  Husband didn't like his either.  I was going to say something but the girls were busy.  I only gave 1 star for the service. The girls were nice."}
{"text":"This unassuming outdoor stand has become one of my favorite spots in Crocker Park and an extremely welcome relief from its neighboring stands (Auntie Annie's, the horribly overpriced Nathan's, and Subway).  The menu is limited to a handful of options, but my personal favorite is the Sweet Corn Pesto with BBQ Chicken.  The sweet BBQ sauce really drives the flavor of the pasta bowl, and the glazed carrots offer nice highlights.  The corn pesto seems to add more texture than flavor (though possibly it's simply overpowered by the BBQ sauce).  My second favorite is the Vermont Mac & Cheese--a simple preparation featuring a decadently rich cheese sauce.

Of course, the fresh pasta is a highlight.  It is also, though, a bit of a limitation as the only noodle available is a somewhat thick, tubular corkscrew (I think cavatappi).  In a perfect world, some fresh fettuccine or tagliatelle would pair well with the Spicy Shrimp Alfredo or the Truffle Bolognese.  Regardless, Pasta Co-Op fills a nice niche of good food that can be served relatively quickly for the Crocker Park crowd."}
{"text":"Pasta! If I was a religious man I'd be Pastafarian.
Yum, I love pasta. I also love pasta that is NOT al dente, all the time. I've ordered this overpriced bowl of undercooked noodles two too many times. There won't be a third even when they reopen this spring. I can get better and less expensive pasta at Brio to-go. 

I'm happy to see a local business in Crocker Park considering they kicked out the other local business that did such great corned beef sandwiches forcing them to transform into a Nathan's Hot Dog stand. Lower the uppity Westlake prices and cook your noodles for longer or at a higher temperature and I may return."}
{"text":"The Pasta Co-Op is a pasta shop located in the outside food court of Crocker Park. As usual, I was in a rush and didn't have a ton of time, but hey, who can go wrong with pasta? While ordering, I asked the gal working if the Pasta Co-Op was a local business or a franchise. She wasn't sure. Upon further research online, the Pasta Co-Op is locally owned and operated.

I ordered the Turkey Truffle Bolognese to-go. My pasta was ready in about 10 minutes. When I opened it, it had a different presentation from the menu picture. Not good or bad, just different and very compartmentalized. Next time, I'll probably order an alternative menu option. The dish felt like something I could have made at home. Still, it was satisfying enough and a large portion but just didn't have a ton of flavor. 

I think the Pasta Co-Op is a place you should really eat at in-person, maybe that would change the experience. Yet, I love the idea of what they're doing (so unique) and I still want to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"First time at Crocker park with my daughter. Nice sunny day to walk around and shop. Stopped to catch a little shade by pasta co-op. Met the owner while sitting at shaded table. Offered us water :)
Apparently sitting worked up my daughters appetite. She ordered the pomodoro marinara with chicken. 
Sturdy bowl and lid. Big order of pasta. 
Won't lie, tried a few bites. Delicious . Waited 5 minutes or so. Served fresh and hot. 
Would stop again when I come back to Crocker park."}
{"text":"I have not weekly but like hourly cravings for their Sweet Corn Alfredo. The perfect bite of sweet corn with the amazing savory Alfredo sauce is to die for. Paired with their amazing pasta, it's amazing. I always get extra mushrooms or throw in shrimp if I'm feeling extra hungry. Everything here is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, exceptional food. I called beforehand to ask for ingredients on some items, and the staff was wonderfully kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. 

I immediately placed my order, and went to go pick it up. It was ready exactly when they said it would be.

The meal was delicious. I got the \"create your own bowl\", using the house pasta, marinara sauce, and a variety of vegetables. The food was hot and fresh upon pick up and consumption, and everything tasted as I expected it to: wonderful.

I have already recommended this place to everyone in my family and a few friends, and I hope to make it back soon."}
{"text":"The Pasta Co-Op is awesome and the food is delicious!  I don't understand the negative reviews.  They make the pasta fresh from scratch, well worth the ten minute wait!  Tom helped us and was so great/informative on the company and food options.  It's nice that they have menu options and/or build your own pasta.  I ordered the Vermont Mac n Cheese with truffle oil and mushrooms - it was so delish!  My husband ordered the Truffle Bolognese made with Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage - also delicious.  We will definitely be back soon, especially with the awesome outdoor location!  Also, good to note - you can order online!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Alfredo pasta dinner!  I'm impressed!!!!!  The Co-op has a flavorful menu to suit just about any palate.  The pasta is fresh-made on site and the sauces are exceptional.  I know this from personal experience, as well as,, from my dining companions.  I've recommended Pasta Co-op to several acquaintances who heartedly agree.  Also, the alfresco dining is as close to an Italian/European experience you'll find almost anywhere in NE Ohio.  Did I also mention..........the service is fast and friendly!  You can't ask for more.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"The person inside showed us the pasta before we ordered. We got the chicken Alfredo and pomadno marinara they are so amazing and full of flavor"}
{"text":"The peanut Thai pasta is to die for, great for the price as well. The staff is friendly and are super flexible. I'm certainly a regular!"}
{"text":"I thought my spicy shrimp alfredo tasted like mac and cheese. I know they make it fresh but I waited almost thirty minutes for my food. Also, I think it is pricey for such a small bowl. I expected a bigger portion for $10. I usually love all things pasta, but I wasn't completely satisfied with my experience here."}
