{"text":"The amber beer was good. The cream of crab soup was hot with good flavor but very little crab. The crab cake bites were ok but not great considering the cost. Alright at best."}
{"text":"3 stars for the staff - they were awesome. I got some amazing stories of \"World's Most Annoying Travelers\" and it was worth the wait. But the food... let's be real: you're in an airport. You can jack the prices as much as you want, but all that fish and shrimp is being flown in frozen boxes from China, let's not kid ourselves, kids... It's totally \"meh.\" But go get a beer at the bar, it's lively, and you will get entertaining stories from the staff if you're just NICE... and please - just be fucking NICE, ok?! Why would you ever be a dick to someone who's bringing you alcohol? I really don't get our species... sigh."}
{"text":"I tried this place in spite of the reviews. Bar customer service is EXCELLENT! (Hence the extra star) Food, not so good. Caesar Salad dressing is a bit bitter, not creamy like I prefer. Mash potatoes tasteless and bitter. Won't eat here again.. Bartender was cute and friendly though :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality. There was a different seafood place open at the food court before, and it was nasty. But this meal was actually good. I had the fish and chips. The seasoned waffle fries were delicious, the fish was average but still good. The cashier offered me a free sample of the clam chowder, also tasty. I will come back to try out some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Second time here. Staff always super nice and great service. Generous  with the drinks and cold beers are great. The food however..  Long story short, it was horrendous. Would never eat here again, but would def have some drinks before boarding the plane."}
{"text":"Fantastic.    Linda the bartendress was great.  The food was mediocre at best,  but it's an airport bar, so what do you expect?  5 stars for the great service.  It was a fine place to spend a 3 hour layover,  then 2 more hours of weather delays (thanks a lot DFW).   The staff was great.   They flipped tables quick so the idiot-in-the -air-going-on-my -1 -flight- every- 5 -years dummies could stuff their face and take their to-go cups on the flight could get out and the frequent fliers among us could make our trips a little more plesent.     Stop here for a drink on your next layover."}
{"text":"Overpriced and poor service, even for an airport.  Crab cakes cold, bland, and dry.  House wine was 21.00.  Coleslaw was nasty, butterfly shrimp tasted frozen.  All was better than the service!"}
{"text":"They say you can truly judge a city by its airport and in that case Charlotte is truly the Quern City! I had a ton of airline miles burning a hole in my Expedia account and vicious thirst for out of town tang I read about in dirtyR4R so I scrappled some funds from the pile I've been saving to record my next EP \"eyes without a phase\" (it's a fully formed concept album inspired by moon and it's many shapes and how they correlate to the shapes of the heart and moods. It's really deep and will be up on cdbaby once I get back to singing weight.) anyway I used some money to pay the 9/11 fees (proud to) and taxes (middle finger emoji) and Charlotte was the cheapeast destination so I doubled down on it.  I don't know crap about the south other than the fact it's cool to make dogs fight each other to the death here and they say Hardee's instead of whataburger. I also knew from reading dirtyR4R that girls in the south like to go \"jowling\" and I liked the idea of that because I assume it involves a pigs mouth.  So I got here and I was blown way by how futuristc the airport was: one side of as all planes with propellers and you can walk on the concrete to them and there's just a little paper sign with your airport code on it so you can literally jump on any place you feel like if you like going to places like mobile or destin; the other side about a half a mile away is full of starbuckses and bojangles and Wolfgang puck salad carts that you ride a moving sidewalk to. People are just lounging around in rocking chairs all over the place grooving to the sweet Carolina sounds of fat and old people not paying attention to one another while handling rolling luggage.  After my twenty minute journey inside I'd worked up a hunger and found this place.  I went straight to the D.  chickenDinner.  Which is what you want to order to truly appreciate a place with the word \"Crab\" in its name. I ordered a batch of Rosemary chicken tenders and said \"take your time honeypies, I'm a man who writes reviews on the Internet for free so a website can exploit that for brand presence and monetary gain.\" Away they went charging me a totally acceptable $11 for three pieces of chicken. In roughly 8 minutes I'd received my meal.  Lightning fast. In fact, I think it's the quickest I've ever received a meal at a fancy sitdown place. Romano's you're on notice.  It was boxed up to go even though I hadn't requested it that way and they started closing door around me so I sat on the floor outside, a man of the people, ready to take in my feast.  I opened the container to reveal my fried tenders. They were shiny and covered in shavings of some sort of cheese that either couldn't, didn't, or had lost the will to melt. BONUS.  I tore one scalding hot tender open to reveal the white meaty flesh and dipped it into the ranch cup... Bliss.  It was like eating a spoonful of old olive oil that had grown a texture. It smelled like old olive oil that was left in a pan and used by your roommate Quinez to reheat eggs. The oils soaked deep into the styrofoam and began to pool on the carpet that I was also using as a napkin. Fearful I may lose the true TASTE OF THE CAROLINAS I hoovered those strips, enjoying each bite. People forget that the most important thing about fried chicken is getting that oil taste to totally cover the boring flavors of chicken, batter, seasonings, and even the dipper sauce.  When I awoke it was Sunday the 7th. I had been asleep in front of the crab sign for four and a half days. My shoes were missing but there was $18 in the top half of my styrofoam container and a bowl of ants and millipedes where my chicken platter once girthed.  I scooped out the money for fees on my return Expedia flight to the city. I was sad I didn't get any while in Charlotte but I don't think the ladies here would appreciate a delicate sensitive lover like myself who's hands and tongue are still just a little bit slicker than the average joe with shoes on."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic lobster roll.  When it arrived I was surprised that it was breaded and pan fried.  That certainly is not how a classic lobster roll is prepared. I took one bite of the lobster meat and it was mush.  Tasted awful.  I could not eat it and almost got sick at the table from the taste and greasiness."}
{"text":"I may have come at a bad time but the food and drinks were bad.  I've had a good experience before but this time was really bad, but I will still give them 3 stars because I know this is not the standard."}
{"text":"Not good. Fish and chips were expensive, oddly shaped (huge cubes) and soggy. I had a bone in one of the pieces of fish. I ended up just eating the waffle fries while I watched the tv at the bar that was turned to a prepaid advertising channel. Overall a pretty average airport experience."}
{"text":"This place gets two instead of one star only because of the very pleasant bartender. I mistakenly ordered a 9oz house white wine (instead of 6oz) without looking at the menu. Had I known it would cost more than a BOTTLE of wine ($19.50), I wouldn't have bothered. So, thanks, Phillips, for letting me experience the most expensive glass of just ok house wine in my life.   I ordered a Caesar salad and crab cake bites. The Caesar was the worst I have ever had. Basically romaine lettuce, croutons and some shredded parm with.. Wait for it... Italian dressing! I kid you not. I had to ask if they gave me the wrong dressing because it was definitely Italian and not Caesar and sure enough, it was awfully correct. This salad was $9. The crab cake bites were good, but 5 super tiny bites for what they charged was nuts.   I'm still in shock. My bill came to $49 including tip. The biggest rip off I've experienced in a long time.   Tip: go elsewhere. I should have sensed trouble when I walked in at peak lunch time to discover a wide open bar."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Deep fried seafood with questionable flavors. Bartender was friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"I ate here during a layover.  It was ok. It didn't change my life. All these airport places, not matter what they brand themselves as are run by HostServices, or Marriott, so why get so excited. I've had the same meal at an airport Chili's"}
{"text":"Wait staff seemed more interested in talking to each other. Overheard a discussion of who's taking Ritalin. Place was less than a quarter full. First server stood at a pos terminal and asked for my drink order.  Second server stood at same and asked what I wanted to eat. My Caesar arrived with no dressing. Not light... none. I asked the 3rd server if they saw any dressing. They said they would give me some more. More implies there was some to begin with. They arrived with a plastic ramekin and slid it on the table. At that point decided I wasn't going to pay $16 for it. I eat out several times a week and have never sent food back. They said \"no problem \" and printed a bill for my wine. Never was I asked if I wanted something else. No manager came by to make it right. Actually the place had the appearance of no one in charge. I have never bothered to write a bad review prior to this one. Next time I'll book a flight the lays over in Atlanta."}
{"text":"bartender Linda is very nice and FAST ! Okay beer mostly deep fried stuff heard burger is great"}
{"text":"Not much into crab cakes (that seems to be their specialty)....but the lobster bisque and seared Ahi tuna (with horseradish sauce) really surprised me (for 'airport' food).  Well worth a visit for a weary traveler!"}
{"text":"Great food and the crab cakes hit the mark.  Service was fast and so was the food delivery.  I ordered the signature dish and was surprised with the quality of the food and portion size.  This is right by C13 and you need to make it a goto place when you have the layover time.  It's seat yourself style but see if you can seat in Teresa's section."}
{"text":"The Lobster Roll is delicious! The bread was soft and toasty and them crinkle cut fries were spectacular. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just like I remembered it as a kid, probably one of the only thing that didn't look different in St Michaels. Excellent crab soup! Great attentive service."}
{"text":"Avoid the Clam Chowder here.  The soup is watered down and there are barely any clams or potatoes in it.  When I inquired about it with the cashier I was told that this is how it is normally served."}
{"text":"I eat at one of these airport places a few times per week, and they are all basically the same. A couple of companies run all of them all over the country, so there isn't a lot of variance. That's really the business model, middle-of-the-road food to capture the middle of the market. They don't need to branch out and offer something spectacular because they have a basically captive audience. It's the airport, so most things are overpriced. Skip all the food, buy and drink some duty-free booze...at least you won't remember the pain of travel. If your company is paying, sit at the bar and down some $10 bloody marys..."}
{"text":"Long wait, terrible food. Waited 30 min for a horrible crab cake. Look around when you walk in, all those miserable faces? Yeah.. you know something is not right, they have all been waiting for forever."}
{"text":"I guess this is a chain, and maybe some are better, but this is not, even by airport standards. The menu shows 2 crabcakes on this $18 plate, but there's only one along with some fried fingerlike objects. Actually a good thing since this was the worst crabcake I've ever eaten. The discshaped fried potatoes were edible. If you ask, you'll find out that draft beer is $8 and up. Wish I had read the other reviews before being fooled into thinking that real crabs were somewhere in the recent history of the kitchen. That would have been the time to use the airport WiFi to Yelp* and avoid Gulp!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat!  We were looking for a quick lunch while walking around Caesar's Palace and stumbled upon the food court.  Prices were reasonable by any standard.  For $9 we had a basket of tasty fried calamari with a pineapple chili sauce and deliciously seasoned waffle fries."}
{"text":"I go thru this airport about every other week and have sense February, Phillips was a must stop in the beginning, I love lobster rolls, well they used to be good here. I have tried them the last 3 times thru and the first of these 3 times there were literally 2 pieces of lobster on 1 of the pieces of Texas toast, I sent this back and the second time it was good. I went back a couple of weeks ago and they were light on the lobster and fries this time, my waitress offered to take it back, but I didn't have time so I just ate what I got. Today I had 6 fries and 3 small pieces of lobster on both rolls, when I ask the bartender if she thought that was worth $20 she snatched it up and said order something else then. I  ask if they could pan sear the tuna and she snapped back, so I felt as though, it was better for me to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Close proximity to my gate is the only reason to return.  Cold lobster bisque and the mahi is undercooked.  Beer is somewhat cold, but service is typical for airports."}
{"text":"I really truly tried to find something good to say about this place, but I couldn't. The service was terrible, the food was expensive and incredibly disappointing.  I am very careful giving bad reviews but I have to warn people away from this place. I ordered the lobster roll and one beer, and my meal was over thirty bucks before tip fit a fairly small portion. They forgot to bring my food even though there was almost nobody in the place, and when I got the lobster roll I literally had to drown it in buffalo sauce to make it edible. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it. From the feedback from a couple other people at the bar with me, their experience was very similar.  Edit: forgot to mention there was a piece of shell in the roll as well."}
{"text":"I was happy to find a full service seafood restaurant so close to my gate since I didn't have a lot of extra time before my connection. I ordered the lobster bisque which came out pretty quickly, however it was only lukewarm and a skin was already forming on the top. It also was very sweet and a bit clumpy. I also had the waffle fries which were highlighted on the menu and they were also only lukewarm, which is pretty unacceptable, especially for fries.  Overall pretty mediocre and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Got a to-go order from here before a flight to NYC. The service was sloooooooooow. I waited 5 minutes at the bar before anyone even acknowledged me. I had already browsed the menu & chosen an entree (a simple chicken avocado BLT with fries), so ordering went fairly quick. I waited another 20 minutes for my order to come out. Thank goodness I wasn't in a huge hurry to catch a flight. Service seemed lackadaisical at best. Sandwich was served hot and tasted good, but the \"side of fries\" only included about 5 waffle fries. I guess if I had time to kill, this place would beat a blank, but if you're on a tight schedule, try some place else."}
{"text":"When I sat down at the bar, the bartender did not say anything or even smile, she just put a menu in front of me. I ordered, someone else brought me my food, and she proceeded to sit at a table with two other employees and gossip loudly. The food was......edible. Not that it mattered, as nobody asked or checked on me at all. I had to wait for them to finish gossiping, come back behind the bar and wash dishes while not even looking up at me even though I was clearly finished with both my food and my drink. I finally had to ask someone else for my bill. Never going back. Don't ever eat here. If you are in the Charlotte airport, there are many other choices, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"1. SERVICE -The service was substandard and i was asked to be skipped 3 times for people only buying a bottled drink.   2. FOOD -All of the food was soggy fried from an obviously under heated fryer.   -Over half the items on the menu that are advertised on every wall were not available. -Crab cake....WTH.....The crab was some kind of rubbery tasteless glob. Anyone whose ever had a REAL Maryland crab cake would confirm it is a pitiful attempt at a eastern shore staple.  I wouldn't eat here again if you gave me the food for free and paid me in gold bullion to do so."}
{"text":"That was the worst fast food experience... The food itself was dry, cold, and tasteless. You can chew a piece of foam with the same result. The service is very slow and they made two mistakes placing an order into the system. We had a very limited time to eat before the show, therefore we used them, but never ever again."}
{"text":"$37.65 got me two small, flat, unimpressive crabcakes that look nothing like the picture, a handful of chopped up romaine, half slice of tomato and 4 deep fried pieces of mystery food that looked like tater tots.  Absolutely ridiculous. The double crabcake meal is an absolute travesty.  Ridiculous that they would serve something that looks like a it could be any pre-packaged crabcake and a handful of the cheapest  letttuce they could find. Last time I will every eat there and I would never recommend this place. I have rarely been more disappointed in a meal. This was a $12 meal at best."}
{"text":"Airport food is usually not all that, so I was very surprised to find this gem in Terminal C. Really liked the crab cakes, which I thought were moist and came with decent fries, pretty good hush puppies, and the best coleslaw I have ever eaten. Their key lime pie is also quite tasty, though perhaps a little too rich for my taste. The service was nice as well. I would definitely go back if I found myself in that part of the airport again."}
{"text":"Waitress Megan very attentive. Manager Colleen was helpful regarding my dietary restrictions. First Phillips beer from tap was not cold, maybe glass came from dishwasher. Colleen brought a 2nd one which was noticeably colder, though flavor a bit too bitter for my preference. I asked for my tuna to be cooked medium, explicitly said slightly pink inside, it came well done and I chose not to wait for a redo. Quality of tuna re: taste was a 2/5. I was hungry, ate it anyway. Veggies on plate boring but Colleen did offer some lemon. Environment loud with music, can't hear TVs. I wouldn't rush back here, just average, at best."}
{"text":"All nice large claws no small body parts the Taragon sauce was a nice Flavor on a toasted roll lobster roll had excellent flavor recommend any seafood lover"}
{"text":"it is bad, the food, even for an airport restaurant.  I ordered a lobster bisque ($8.99) and blackened mahi mahi ($17.99).  There was absolutely no piece of lobster meat in my soup and taste was very plain. Side dishes were warmer than the mahi mahi itself, and fish was at the verge of being burned.   water has some moldy smell/taste. their filters must be really old and dirty.  Service was OK, did not wait too long but my waiter was not the most friendly one with the biggest smile.  I normally do not eat anywhere with less than 4 stars on yelp, I was rushing, I regret."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was at the Venetian a little while ago and got a crab pretzel and the server Maria was so sweet! They also threw in some fries with the crab pretzel, they're really awesome and the whole experience was great! I would definitely come back again. The price is a little high but that's to be expected when you're down on the strip, and the food is really fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Not great...lobster bisque tasted fishy, dirty martini was way too salty. Better than other airport options, but don't count on a great meal."}
{"text":"For $13, you get pretty much nothing in terms of eight chicken breast hamburger. The marketing words on the menu leave the possibility that it might be good, but it's just a hit-and-run typical airport food experience. I will say that it's on the low side of quality, even for an airport."}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast. The menu says eggs your way. That really means any way as long as scrambled. The whole breakfast was marginal at best.  Server was good and friendly and rescues it from 1 star. Good food in the Charlotte airport is impossible to come by."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food and the bar is OK to kill time. The food was pretty greasy and you can enjoy it with the plastic fork and knife provided.  Reasonable for being inside a terminal."}
{"text":"Had the lobster roll tonight please stay away from this worst thing I ever ate. Sick as heck right now not to be vulgar but I almost didn't make it from my seat on the plane to the bathroom"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, and food is not much better. Bartenders are rude and don't seem to understand the concept of customer service. The manager on duty tonite set a terrible example. I'm sorry to anyone in this terminal, as there are not many choices."}
{"text":"First, the clam chowder was a good size, with medium pieces of clam in it.  Very creamy with right amount of potatoes.  The crab cake was large with veggies in it.  Also delish.  Last, I was surprised by the amount of shrimp.  The cocktail sauce actually had horseradish that you could taste, which was yummy.  I asked them NOT to put the sides in with the dish because I wouldn't eat them, but they still put fries and slaw in with the meal.  I didn't eat it and felt bad for wasting the food.  But the seafood was tasty.  All in all, a great find in the food court!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of eating here yesterday.  I was craving calamari so I stopped in during a layover.  I sat at the bar and this woman with an angry face came over to me and said \"Can I help you?\" as if I wasn't a customer but a straggler lost and looking for directions.  She should have said \"Hi there.  What can I get you to drink?\" with a smile rather than just starring me down with her cold dead eyes.    Anywho, I gave her my order and soon thereafter, my plate of burnt calamari came out.  This restaurant serves the calamari with a pineapple sauce which was bizarre.  There's a reason most every restaurant in this country serves calamari with some type of marinara sauce.  I wish they would serve what people universally enjoy rather than trying to reinvent the wheel with a pineapple dipping sauce.  A few minutes after I was served my food, the mean waitress came over and asked me if I was going to be staying long because her shift ended at 4 and it was like 4:09.  She smiled when she told me her shift was ending.  It was the first time she smiled at me since I had sat down.  She asked if she could bring me my check.      Between the nasty food and the awful customer service, I was really turned off and ready to get out of a place where I clearly wasn't wanted.  I left the money next to the plate of calamari that I had hardly touched and went to another restaurant in the airport to have a proper meal.  1/10, will never go to a Phillips Seafood again."}
{"text":"Not at all bad for an airport. Had the Cobb Crab salad. Lettuce and Tomatoes were extremely fresh, along with the egg, cheese, avocao, bacon, and crab. Beat the hell out of the usual airport possibilities...Sbarros, Burger Torture,Chic Fil A et all. No complaintsfrom any of the diners around me."}
{"text":"Nice server, fast service. Delicious food. I was expecting to get something to just fill me up but was surprised when my food was great. Got a burger with rice pilaf instead of fries, no bun, add avocado. It was so good."}
{"text":"Waiter was MIA.  Finally got a glass of water, food was dropped off over cooked and fair at best.  No refills, no checking to see if I needed anything or how was meal.  Never even got check.  Waiting game with no results.  Had to leave cash and go."}
{"text":"Crab cakes are the specialty here ... So you'd like to think a lot of care would be taken in the prep and presentation.  I ordered the crab cake mini app - mini for sure 5 tiny over fried (in old oil) teeny little crab cake balls. Not a lot of flavor.  They missed the boat on this one. Friendly, attentive staff earned the stars."}
{"text":"Airport location....it was ok. I ordered the crab cakes and they only give you 1 crab cake and some fries and it was pricey...even by airport standards. I would look for another option"}
{"text":"Nice place! Little on the expensive side but I am at the airport. Really good crab cakes though and friend service."}
{"text":"Food was good service sucked the waitress literally forgot me sitting there on numerous occasion, on drink on food and getting my check to me"}
{"text":"Skip it! We only tried this place because our plane was late, we missed our connecting flight. The bartender was more like an older cleaning lady than a bartender. We tried rosemary chicken tenders which arrived, but not fully cooked. After cutting it, I could see the smooth shiny meat, clear sign it was not fully cooked. We just asked the manager if he could take care of that, and our 1/2 glasses of wine that we drank and went to another bar steps away. Fortunately, the manager was very kind and did take care of the bill without any kind of fight."}
{"text":"After spending an afternoon at the pools (in summer) daddy needs a nap. Enter Phillips Seafood. Opted for the mahi & shrimp platter with hush puppies & slaw.  Now don't get me wrong, I likes me a high-class meal. But when I'm in Vegas all alone-like, I use my Total Rewards reward credits. And at thirteen ninety-nine, this fits the bill perfectly. Yes, some of it was a wee bit over-cooked, but that's better than under-cooked! C'mon, fish? In the desert? And I'm not sick? That's a win anytime.  Now leave me alone, after all that good protein, daddy's gonna disco nap!"}
{"text":"As airports go, it can difficult to locate a spot that has decent food, decent service and a few choices.  Phillips Seafood fits that bill.  I had no high expectations as I entered. I was interested in something other than the typical airport wrap, taco or burger. I had the Ahi Tuna as recommended by the server. The tuna was a bit on the chewy side.  The vegetable medley and Cole slaw were tasty. Phillips won't be in the running for Charlotte's best seafood anytime in the near future. But, the Server was prompt, courteous and efficient. Given prompt service and a nice spacious window seat for people watching, I can forgive a lot of things.  Next time, I'll try the crab cakes.  They looked very good!"}
{"text":"Over priced for small portions.   I'm a big lover of all things seafood but I'm not going to pay 30$ for 14$ worth of food. Not even if it's at airport.   But the server was nice and the place was clean. I recommend the ABCLT."}
{"text":"I went here to have a decent meal before my flight but I gave myself over an hour so that I could relax a bit.  That is where it all fell apart, I ordered the Crab Cake Slider appetizer and it took them over an hour to get me my meal and I had to take it to go.  Then to make matters worse the waitress blamed it on me and my order why it took so long.  I personally will not be going back to this establishment since it takes so long.  The food when I did get it was ok but nothing that I will miss."}
{"text":"I had a crab cake. It was tasty but  I was pretty disappointed with the portion. For $18, you get one 3 inch crab cake and a lot of waffle fries with some slaw."}
{"text":"Just writing a quick review to remind myself to never come in here again. Service is always gruff,  drinks and food waaaay over priced. .. And now I can add poor food quality to my list of issues. I should know better.  My salad (see pic) was missing three of the 5-6 listed ingredients,  came with maybe an ounce of dressing... And if those are mixed baby greens,  I was born on Mars! Just one of those leftover dinosaurs from the days when airports could get away with everything... it needs a gut job!  Oh, did I mention the obviously backed up grease trap coating my food,  my clothes,  etc with a stench that's beyond nauseating?"}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was super bomb. 10/10 would eat again. Unfortunately the price for a soft drink is $4.50! That's the only problem. I mean, that's what movie theaters charge for sodas. This is in the food court. Otherwise the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I don't have lobster rolls often, but when I do, they better be delicious and packed with fresh seafood. Despite the food court location, Phillips fits the bill. $15 will get you a decent-sized roll packed with lobster and a heap of seasoned waffle fries.  Bread was super-buttery but a bit hard, lobster was a generous portion and lightly seasoned. I didn't care for the massive lettuce leaf- seemed to be more for color and presentation than flavor, ended up tossing it. Fries were your basic frozen-seasoned-waffle type. From reading previous reviews, it seems like they made the portion bigger so this easily makes a filling meal."}
{"text":"Positives: * The waitress was very nice. * They were open on Christmas Eve.  Negatives: * The waitress was not remotely competent. * The beer was skunked. * The fries--which took 15 minutes to arrive--were pale and ice cold."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had at a restaurant since my last time at Taco Bell 7 years ago. Ordered the crab cobb salad and it was a very pale plate- iceberg lettuce was white with brown edges, crab was sad and grey. I couldn't really eat it. Choose a different restaurant in the airport!"}
{"text":"Was not happy when I came here the first time and they were out of lobster rolls. However, I was advised to come back later, and when I did the lobster rolls were back. They were also very good."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Charlotte, NC airport I always make the trek Down to the end of terminal C to eat at Phillips seafood. Decorated with tin, you get the feeling you are on the banks of the Atlantic Ocean at a fisherman's wharf.  Phillips' specialty is the Lobster roll. The lobster roll is chunks of lobster served on a toasted bun with a light butter sauce. It comes with waffle fries in a tall plastic cup.  You need a little salt and pepper on your lobster roll and then you are ready to get down!  I would also like to add that my waitress was super awesome and got me in and out of there in 15 minutes today!  It took about 10 minutes to make my lunch and 5 for me to wolf it down.   Thank you super awesome waitress!    This decadent lunch is sinful, but well worth the guilt of paying $20 for lunch only to pack on the kind of calories one should eat at dinner."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel through Charlotte Douglas International Airport - try to stop by this place. Absolutely love it! One of the best crab cakes I've ever tried. The place gets booked pretty quickly, so had to wait for a table a couple of times. Server is always speedy and friendly (I usually deal with the Brazilian guy there). Wine is good too."}
{"text":"It's alright, a typical airport restaurant. Overpriced but that's at all airports. I got the fish and chips and they were good but more batter than fish. $14.99 is steep but you gotta eat. Anyway it's not bad."}
{"text":"I found Phillips on a layover from DFW headed back to RIC.    I have great memories of the Phillips in Baltimore.  They were 100% grade A.    At the airport - not so much.   Seemed like most choices were either fried or deep fried.   The one in Baltimore has the world's best pan seared lump crab cake in the world.    Airport not so much.    Ordered that crab cake sautéed  and only choice was fried.   Turned out to be deep fried in not great oil.    Really a shame.   Phillips in MD set the standard for a 5 star crab cake.   Their satellite locations did not learn well from home office........      Staff was very pleasant and attentive.  No issues with service - just not the Inner Harbor MD Philips that I was use to.     3 stars based on great service - but they could use a schooling from Home base in Baltimore."}
{"text":"None of us expect much from airport food. So it won't be shocking this is a two star dinner on a good day. Frozen seafood and \"vegetables,\" topped with poor service and an unattentive staff. But when you have to do it you gotta do it."}
{"text":"Hey, it's in the airport, but it was quite good with very friendly servers. Good sized portions and fast service make it a good stop at CLT."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips, the cod was amazing came with waffle fry's and Cole slaw. The restaurant was very hot made it hard to enjoy the food. Was seat your self with fast paced service just what you expect in the airport."}
{"text":"Located at the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace, this little express counter was actually one of the better choices.  Before deciding on this place, across the way, the cashier lady at Earl of Sandwich told me \"Someone put an order of 100 sandwiches, and are you willing to wait over 30 minutes for your order?\"  Um, \"NO\" I'll go to Phillips.    Now, as far as I know, Phillips is a well known favorite originating in the Baltimore area.  While residing in the Bay Area and being spoiled with San Francisco's seafood, this joint had better live up to the eastcoast hype.    The two cashiers at the counter were nice and gave us samples of the clam chowder and cream of crab.  We opted for the chowder, as the cream of crab was a bit like drinking seawater.  The chowder however seemed a bit better with pieces of clams, cube cuts of potatoes, and small pieces of bacon (small cup, $6.49).  Decent, but not up to SF standards.  I didn't order a drink, but asked about the fountain drinks and was told $4.95.  Eeek, what a waste!  I'll gamble at a table and tip a dollar.  No thank you.    We also ordered a Classic Lobster Roll ($14.99), because it's the most expensive thing on the menu board.  It's my first time, so I had to try what they're \"known for\".  Now, the cool part was seeing the meaty claw parts, and it wasn't overpowering with the mayo.  It was tasty it, but actually the kicker was the seasoned waffle fries.  I'm in agreement with all the other reviews that these were SFG, \"So Freakin' Good!\"    So in conclusion, was it a good representation for the eastcoast?  Probably so!  Would I come back here?  Probably, but only if I were at one of their real locations in Baltimore.  It's worth a try in my opinion, or you can opt to wait in the long line at Earl of freakin' 100 Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Came in dead tried waiting on my flt. My took my order right way. He asked how my Maryland crab soup was I advised it had the flavor but lacked the crab. HE FIXED THAT RIGHT WAY. I advised I wanted the mini crab cakes he advised me of the number of them and the size. FYI they are the size of mini meatballs however extremely  flavorful. Great experience  just didnt like to hear about a bad patron that was acting crazy earlier. The young ladies should take that to the back in the future. All in all I was extremely  satisfied. BTW I am not a nice person when I am tired so for me to give 5 stars in this condition is great. I will return when i come back to CLT."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Bloody Mary (spicy), and crab cake. Worth going out of your way. I landed in terminal B and had a connector in E!  Crab cake had generous chuncks of lump crab. Great price, too!!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes barely had any crab. It was all bread crumbs and stringy meat. Zero lumps of crab."}
{"text":"(03/05/2017)  Was in the way home to Bawlmore from a trip to Florida, felt a little homesick and found myself at Phillips.  I did have the crab cake before at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson after another homesick tour, but it wasn't like being in Charm City, so opted for the special of the day, the Lobster Roll.  Baltimore is not exactly known for lobster, and an airport may not be the most authentic place, but the split top roll was decent, and while the lobster meat wasn't exactly fresh cracked from a Maine tail, more like it was frozen \"langostino \"(galatheid crab) from Chile, but there was plenty of it with some shredded romaine and a fairly zippy lemon and spiced mayo.  The bar service was attentive and as always at an airport there's plenty of bar company to be had for the lone traveler.  This restaurant seems to close earlier than most in the concourse and they were eagerly awaiting the remaining customers to get the hell out before 10pm.  They were pretty familiar with each other, maybe it might be a good idea to keep the conversations related to getting the customers out to themselves, you know we can hear you :)  The food was pretty good as was the service, very serviceable for an airport restaurant, does the hometown proud."}
{"text":"Over priced and no seasoning  The service was horrible  We never got refills   The waitress was very nice but it just felt like we were forgotten  We tried the lobster bisque  Sampler Lobster roll Nothing to brag about and for the price not worth it"}
{"text":"Friendly service gets a 5.  Food a 3.  Average is a 4.  Better than other spots in terminal C in the Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"Airport location. East Coast chain. Decent seafood, airport pricing. Craft brew on tap. Always a plus. Crab cake and crab Cobb salad. Friendly efficient staff. Music was all oldies. Football on the flat screens. Nice break from the hustle of the terminal."}
{"text":"Not worth price of admission!  I ordered the fish and chips ($11.99, $10.99 with Harrah's Total Rewards card) and it definitely was a let down from the get-go.  The fish look like frozen VanDeKaamp stuff you buy in the grocery store and are a good size of you're planning on feeding a 5 yr old.  The only saving grace are the waffle fries which are good, but not $11-12 good.    If you're craving seafood, go for it.  If not, there are plenty of other places around."}
{"text":"I made the right choice by picking the sea food platter. It was an assortment of crab cake. Shrimp and calamari. An absolute delight if you are a sea food lover. Given there location they keep there services prompt. I would definitely have a quick bite here when I am in Charlotte airport again."}
{"text":"Really torn on this review as my server was an absolute pleasure and really seemed to care about her job.  She was really sweet and I can not fault her for a thing.  That said, upon completion of my fried seafood sampler, I found a small cockroach making his way across my table...it seemed to have emerged from underneath my plate.  The waitress immediately brought out her manager and they promptly comped my meal.  With all of the niceties aside, this was one of the most horrendous experiences I have ever had at a restaurant in my life...we are not in the Bronx here...were in a major airport.  All I can say is WOW.  Hopefully I don't throw up on this flight home.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"I told my husband to take me to the most expensive place!  So he takes me to the airport!!   De duh dum!  If you find yourself in the C concourse, check out Phillips Seafood.  They card everyone, good for the ego, til you see the big sign that reads: We I.D. All Guest!  Decent $10 bloody mary."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a three hour layover. Our food came out piping hot within 15 minutes. The waffle fries were seasoned very good, and they had a nice crispy crunch. The fish was also good, but very dense. I felt like maybe I should have ordered something lighter. The only thing that was off putting to me was when a pilot came in to order a quick takeout, the waitress gave him the nastiest attitude. He was being very nice, and the waitress kept huffing around and acting irritated. Very strange."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great lobster rolls at a very affordable price. The crab soup is also delish. I come here almost every time I'm at Caesars."}
{"text":"Don't waste your $ on less than par food.  I am eating the seafood sampler as I'm writing this and \"it sucks\" is a severe understatement.  The eggrolls are horrible tasting and have a weird texture. The crab cakes are bready with a small amount of crab pieces and have a strange taste.  The only thing edible are the shrimp which are your standard breaded shrimp you can get for $5 at your grocer's freezer.  If you're craving seafood don't bother getting it here.  You will leave hungry, angry and $15 poorer."}
{"text":"I have been to other locations but this is the first time. The rude waitress would not change my side of fries to a salad. Ended up paying for a salad separately and just had them scrap the fries. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight at the location in the Charlotte airport during a long layover.  I ordered the buffalo shrimp appetizer and I was very disappointed.  When it came it looked like a big bowl of hot sauce with the shrimp thrown it. The breading was so saturated it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Crab omelette I had here was wonderful and tasty. My waiter was a cool fella who was very kind and attentive, I'd stop here again on my next layover."}
{"text":"Wow. Staff work hard, but service slow. Ordered edamame and mini crab cakes. I've been ripped off in airports before but this takes it to a new level. Super small quantities of poor quality food. Would not return."}
{"text":"I had the crab and shrimp wrap tonight and it was so incredible!!! Great service and great food! I would suggest this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this less stars I would. I am from Baltimore/DC where Phillips is an institution. I asked the cashier if these were TRUE Phillips crabcakes because I would know if they werent. She assured me and i ordered the two crabcake basket with two orders of fries as my sides.   At $21 the price is kinda steep (and this was with no drink). These crabcakes were a mess. They were at least half filler w corn meal and peppers. We do not put peppers on our crabcakes in Baltimore/DC because we want to taste our beloved Blue Crab Anyway what i got was a greasy mess with only a couple bites of actual lump crab meat in both cakes. Thank God I got two because the amount of crab in theae small cakes both was barely equal to one in Baltimore. Its too expensive for what you get, its way too greasy and mushy (like defrosted frozen cakes) and the taste is just horrible (unless ur a big green and red pepper fan which I am not).    And finally, you get two sides, i wanted two sides of fries, im sure they only gave me one servings worth. The fries were the best part.   Avoid this deep fried, expensive unsatisfying mess."}
{"text":"Based on samples I'd eaten when Phillips Seafood had booths at the National Restaurant Show in Chicago, I was happy to see one of their restaurants today at CLT airport.  What a disappointment. Both the fried shrimp and the waffle fries I ordered were way below average. To add insult to a waste of time and calories, I was short-changed when I paid with cash.  I caught the error, and the change was corrected before I left.   There appear to be several better choices at CLT. I'd recommend trying something else."}
{"text":"Probably the worst airport food experience I've ever had... expensive yet unimpressive Bloody Mary, oysters that tasted like they were fished out of a portapoty (first time I've ever spit out an oyster), slow service, and an incorrect tab."}
{"text":"Just average, crab meat does not taste ocean fresh, could be from a can. Service is just average. Would not go back if there is another lay over in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I had never seen a food court version of this Maryland seafood stalwart, but I thought, why not give it a try? It is located in the food court in Caesar's Palace, and unlike most places in the casino, the prices did not seem out of line. Unfortunately, the recurring theme of feeling cheated in Vegas continues here.   Some choices weren't bad...the lobster roll, though the most expensive item at $15, was at least a reasonable version with plenty of large chunks of real (though bland and tough) lobster. It even came with waffle-cut fries. They did not have cream of crab any of the times I asked for it...the lobster bisque was just ok...no chunks of lobster. It kinda tasted like Costco's version. The New England Clam Chowder also tasted like it came straight from a can...inoffensive but edible.   The real outrage were the crab cakes and the fried scallop roll. These crab cakes were not even the mediocre ones usually served at Phillips restaurants on the east coast (though they were priced like them)...no, I am pretty sure these were straight out of the box Phillips-branded frozen \"crab cakes\" sold at Costco. As a native Marylander, I was offended. The topper was the realization that the \"bargain\" scallop roll at $9 was a manifestation of the devil's science lab...they figured out a way to use surimi to fake scallops! Come on man! Bay scallops are relatively cheap...but you just had to use fake bay scallops???  Coming to Vegas in the old days, you always had an idea that they were giving you the finger behind your back...now, they do it right up in your face. Sigh."}
{"text":"Tried the Lobster Roll and samples the crab bisque. Both were delicious. Went to the Food Court at Ceasar Palace around 2:00pm. No line and the wait was ~5-7mins. The food court is clean and it was easy to find seats.  I asked for light butter on thw bread thanks to a previous yelpers review. The butter on the bread came out just right. The lobster was delicious and fresh and in big clumps.  Waffle fries were cajuned seasoned.  Total cost was $14.99 + tax. Came out to be around $16.64 or something.  Will come back when I crave a lobster roll. I think it is slightly cheaper but the same size as the one served in Valley Fair Mall in San Jose.  The crab bisque was creamy. For ~$6 it is pricey (airport pricey)"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Food came out in under five minutes, hot and fresh. If you are in a hurry, they will definitely take care of you! They were moderately busy at the time too. Server and manager were great. Had a small issue, they took care of it immediately, and made sure I was happy. I'll be happy to come back next time I come through."}
{"text":"Waited an hour in line to be told they are out if caesar salad. One person running the front: register and serving. They don't even have the decency to announce (or put a sign up) that are out of an item so people don't waste their time waiting."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood crab soup. It had to be the dirtiest place i ever ate at. The soup taste like it was sitting in a pot the whole week. Nasty. Don't eat there."}
{"text":"Like some other reviewers, I thought that the food was okay, but Ryan, my strapping 240 linebacker of a guy serving me, made up for the deficiencies with quick delivery and a highly personable experience.  The Crab Cake was the best part of my meal, a lot of crab, but the cole slaw was drab and the withered lemon wedge and wilted lettuce told me this place doesn't have top-notch preparation.  Waffle fries were good.  Lipitor chaser optional. BThe crab soup was watery, not creamy, and the beer forgettable.  The lighting was harsh, too, but for $40 plus tip, I got a sembling passage of North Carolina cuisine, and great service.  Good luck, Ryan!  paulgarlington@mac.com"}
{"text":"Great value for lister rolls . Compare with lobster me at Venetia, where is is about $19 vs $15"}
{"text":"Was somewhat hesitant to try this place out but decided to give the soups a try. That day they had clam chowder and lobster bisque. Clam chowder was pretty typical and everywhere so I decided on the lobster bisque.   Overall the pricing was average; you get what you pay for. The flavor on the other hand was disappointing, the flavor really wasn't there and was near bland. There wasn't much lobster bits in the soup and had to add some salt and the crackers provided for some flavor.   The cashier was polite and courteous but doesn't help their soup flavor. Hesitant to try anything else they offer."}
{"text":"Really really good burger...surprisingly. Not much else to say as I didn't have anything else but Man! That was a tasty burger! Cottage fries were pretty darn good too. I like this place and it sure does beat Chili's and the like.  At least this time!"}
{"text":"Pricey, small portions. Fries are heavy on the salt. Sides, I.e. Coleslaw at $2.99 should have been at the most a buck."}
{"text":"In between flights at CLT, sat down, ordered crab cake sliders. All three slider buns had mold on them.  Lost my appetite for eating there. Sent the food back and walked out.  If they can't observe that  a bun has mold, it worries me about all other health issues they are ignoring. Go somewhere else to eat in the airport."}
{"text":"If you want fast fried food, sure. I orders the mini crab cakes and the lobster bisque. The crab cakes taste good but I didn't expect them to be deep fried and would not have ordered them if I knew so. The bisque tasted like salt with clumps of filler. If I was especially hungry it would be worth it.  However, they took my order fast and the food came out fast. Good service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Probably the worst lobster roll I've had in my life. And they gave me a total of 4 waffle fries."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Portions were not that great though and a little pricey. Might come back...maybe."}
{"text":"Never have tried this place before, but someone I was with had them another time and suggested we stop. Service was a little slow to get our food, but that's okay. We both got the cod sandwich and fries. Really great and filling! The sandwich was on the smaller side, fries made up for it. The hush puppies weren't that great. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had the Signature crab cake. The crab was good but very small and you only get one. It's about an 3 inch in diameter. You get more waffle fries than anything. For $19 I guess I thought you would get more crab cake."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the C terminal of the airport.  I was excited because I've never eaten at Phillips Seafood and always wanted to.    The menu wasn't extensive and it was pretty pricey.  Options included a handful of appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burger, and entrees.  I ordered the angus burger and the seafood sampler appetizer.  The burger was really greasy, but delicious.  The  bread got really soggy from all of the grease that was on the plate.  It came with a tiny handful of waffle fries and a sliced pickle.  The seafood sampler was my favorite.  Sampler came with 3 little crab balls, 5 fried shrimp, and 5oz of calamari.  Everything was fried perfectly and well seasoned. The crab weren't dry at all and was delicious.  There were also 3 dipping sauces that were provided: tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, and sweet thai chili sauce.   Service was great.  i guess I came at the right time as I read how slow it can get.  The waitress was kind and attentive and my food arrived about 10 mins after I ordered.  Tables had ketchup, salt/pepper/ and old bay seasoning just incase you wanted more."}
{"text":"Combine a captive audience with inept cuisine and what do you get? This place.   We figured that a place clearly proclaiming both seafood and salads might serve something besides deep fried garbage. Sure enough, they had the odd salad and grilled fish on the menu.  Perhaps some person at the restaurant picked up that two ravenous travelers leaving behind half eaten plates means the food is barely edible. But based on how the hostess seemed clueless to the massive bags in the aisles (hey, it is in an airport) as she led weary passengers zig-zagging through an airport version of American Ninja, I'm guessing paying attention isn't something they do well here.  By the way, making food also isn't something they do well here. My grilled fish, really a simple enough dish, was rank with fishiness probably from sitting out for too long or just not being very fresh. The salad had limp lettuce turning brown at the edges, probably from one of those bags of pre-cut greens being opened a while ago. The veggies were die-cut thawed frozen veggies with a pat of butter thrown on them.  Really gross."}
{"text":"Starbucks nearby had a line wrapped around the corner, so I decided to try this place. They had breakfast. My flight was quick, so I hoped I would get fast service.   Unfortunately, no service. And there were maybe 5 customers. I see why Starbucks had the long line.  I went next door and got a monster and hummus, then out of spite at the good at Phillips. Ahhh then the service was prompt!    Evidently when someone goes to get food, they are gone and no one else is capable of helping.   I look and the Starbucks line has to be 30 deep."}
{"text":"Service was almost non existent. The food was cold, boring and tasted store bought, especially the coleslaw.  I should have grabbed a sandwich at Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"What was that?  Should have read reviews first.  Ordered lobster roll and the waffle fries were better than the roll.  Not sure how that was lobster - tasted like fish not lobster and not that fresh fish taste either. Huge mistake and for $17 I expect lobster.  The mini bun it came on was good because it held less fish or lobster if that's what it was.  Service was efficient but no personality just like the foid.  Yuck"}
{"text":"Nkt bad. Just odered appetizer seafood sampler. Crab cake minis are the size of small hush puppies. Shrimp is basic frozen type..calamari is goooood. Ordered side salad which was fresh and big!."}
{"text":"I tried this place when I was doing a transfer at the Charlotte airport. I tried the Crab Omelette, which at $13, was very pricey. It was an interesting concept, but the quality of the food was very average. The service is quick, however, and the server is quite attentive."}
{"text":"Eat at your own risk.  I got food poisoning from the Ahi Tuna on Friday and spent the rest of the weekend in bed.  The fact that I was traveling made it that much worse.  Learn from my mistake.  Never eat seafood at an airport.  Well known brand or not, it's just not worth the risk..."}
{"text":"I saw they were serving my favorite soup lobster bisque.  Excitedly I waited until they opened at 11am. But to my huge disappointment the soup was beyond words terrible.... it tasted like cheese with a hint of seafood flavoring.  Lobster bisque usually has some lobster meat shreds or something...this was straight cheese liquid ... disgusting... I say save your money avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"They're located near gate C10, just where I was to board my flight so tho't I'd try them. Their Philips Amber Ale on tap was very flavorful. And their signature Philips Seafood Seasoned Waffle Fries were just out of the world! The Blackened Ahi Tuna was kinda ok! Not bad, but not the best I've had elsewhere. Overall a nice place.. Service may be slightly slower though so plan accordingly"}
{"text":"Unbelievably pricey! This place gets $15.50 for a small glass of del Vento pinot grisio. This wine retails for $10 A bottle! Unbelievable! I don't understand restaurants that rape travelers. I mean I understand higher rents in airports but REALLY?!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before a show at the Colosseum and decided to give Phillips a try.  There was a short line that moved quickly.  I ordered the classic lobster roll and a small new england clam chowder.  I gave her my total rewards card which takes a buck off each item.  After I paid I noticed I didn't get the TR pricing.  I went back to ask and she said I didn't give her my card.  We went back and forth for a minute and then she called a manager on a walkie talkie who eventually came and fixed it.  Both the cashier and the manager were nice but it was annoying and not worth the $2 saved.  The lobster roll was very good although I could do without the lettuce on it.  It was packed with big chunks of lobster and the roll was grilled perfectly.  I thought the price was great too ($14.99 or $13.99 with TR card) especially for being in a casino.  I've paid more for less many times.  The clam chowder was ok.  Better than average but not great.  Overall one of the better choices in the Caesars food court."}
{"text":"Ok!  If you are in Terminal C and you need a stiff drink-Phillips Seafood is where you want to be!  Remember this is an airport-so don't have regular expectations of more than casual dining.    The food is not the best-plus you are paying for the Phillip Seafood name--so expect higher prices than average!  I would recommend that you just sit back- enjoy a cocktail or two before your flight!  They pour heavy on the cocktails-so be prepared to feel good and groovy on your flight!"}
{"text":"Fast, economical, good.   Three things I look for in airside food and this place has it. I try to avoid transferring via clt but might go for it more often now knowing this place exists."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of money. I spent $50 here and the only thing I was satisfied with were the waffle fries. The lobster bisque was watery and bland and definitely lacking flavor. The lobster roll was a cold lobster salad kind. It was watery, bland, and tasteless. The scallop roll was all lettuce and bread with only a few pieces of fried scallop. The scallop was also overly fries so it was mostly hard batter. The shrimp and crab platter was okay. The shrimp was good but then again who can screw up shrimp? The crab cake was just alright and the waffle fries were just like any other waffle fries. Would I come back? Hell no."}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips, friendly staff, fast service good for families and easy walking distance from most terminals at Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"Good seafood considering you're in the middle of a casino food court. Great offerings that you wouldn't find in a fast food seafood portion of a menu. Food takes about 8 minutes and is a bit pricey but it was enjoyable. Food portions are nice and you can spare a few bites to allow someone to nibble. Loved the fries! Overall will be back."}
{"text":"Got here super early n had coffee n breakfast@ the bar .Ryan the bartender was super nice ,chatty n quick.cool place to have a meal n drink in between flights."}
{"text":"I ordered a seafood platter. It was ok. I enjoyed the crab cakes. Those were good. But the shrimp tasted aged and the calamari was just ok. I don't think I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Phillips in the airport but don't expect what you get in a local restaurant.  Decent crab sliders and I tried the Phillips amber ale - not bad.   Service can be erratic when very busy.  I'd rather eat here than in most of the other fast-food airport joints."}
{"text":"Concourse C at the airport. Good wine and beer selection and good staff at the bar. Ordered the appetizer sampler of shrimp, calamari, and mini crab cakes. Awful-I wouldn't order any other good except maybe burger/fries/salad. Bar-person was gracious and removed charge."}
{"text":"Passable fries. Burger was not good. Lobster roll ok. I apologized to everyone in my party for taking them in there."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the airport and used the new Kallpod button.  My flight was boarding in 15 but I needed more wine (hah) and my check.   I got both immediately and made pre-boarding by pushing one button on the Kallpod.  Also the chicken sandwich was banging!"}
{"text":"Phillips Seafood is part of the new food court that is now in the Caesars Palace Colosseum. The food court has a great mix of eateries for their patrons to choose from. There's Phillips, Smashburger, a Mexican joint, a ramen & sushi place and an ice cream shop.   I love the lobster roll here at Phillips Seafood. I have never seen an establishment put so much lobster meat into a roll. The lobster flesh was plentiful, fresh and absolutely delicious. The waffle fries were crispy and savory too. I will not hesitate to patronize this place again when I am back at Caesars."}
{"text":"Pretty much as expected.  Airport.  \"Lobster\".  Those two just don't seem to go together, and at Philips,  they definitely didn't.  I got an entree salad and decided to have the \"lobster\" put on top.  There WAS some lobster on the salad, which seemed to have been microwaved.  Also there was some other meat which tasted like crab.  Hmm.  I didn't eat too much of it.  The entree salad was generous and really good, however.  My server was nice , but she was just trying to up sell the hell outta me, which puts me Ill at ease.  Next time I will stick to the salad."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Phillip's Seafood while in the Charlotte airport recently, on my way to New York. I had stopped at several other places and nothing appealed to me for breakfast. For the same price I would have paid for a sandwich elsewhere, I got one of the best omelettes I've ever had in my life! It was very big, and filled with delicious crab meat and cheese; it was amazing. It also came with a generous side of potatoes and toast. Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time, so I had to ask the server/bartender to move everything from the plate to a to-go box, so there was no time to take a pic...but I will seek it out any time I am in the Charlotte airport again! I am surprised at all the negative reviews because the service I received was exceptional, and everyone else there seemed to be enjoying it, too. I highly recommend breakfast at Phillip's Seafood!"}
{"text":"I was nervous to eat here given the other reviews, but it was close to my gate and I was hungry.  My experience was great. Seating is a bit confusing (you walk in and seat yourself), but I didn't wait long for service. My server, Teresa, was very prompt and nice. I had a glass of Riesling (wine list is short and overpriced, but typical of a chain), cream of crab soup (yummy!!!) and fish and chips (really perfectly done). Prices are on the high side but, again, this is an airport. I don't know where the comments about paper/plastic plates came from. My meal was on regular glass plates with silverware. This hit the spot. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Not impressed.    My cream of crab soup was lukewarm.  And they're not kidding when they say cream--it's definitely more a bisque than any kind of chowder.  No real crab taste.    My shrimp salad with pecans, Gorgonzola and dried cranberries came with 11 pieces of deep dried shrimp coated in a sweet and spicy glaze (kind of Thai), not bad but too sweet for me.  To his credit the waiter made sure I liked spicy food when I ordered and it did have a kick.  It came on a bed of lettuce but nothing else--no pecans, Gorgonzola or dried cranberries.  I realized this after I ate half the salad and had to remind the waiter to go get some.  It left me wondering if he also left the soup on the counter and let it get cold before delivering to my table.   Unremarkable food and unremarkable service.  Convenient and sitdown--that's about it."}
{"text":"Beer: forgettable domestics. Atmosphere: lighting is perfect for hiding from pursuing bounty hunters. Food: had the chicken avocado BLT sandwich. The chicken had enough grease to stream down my hands, but was completely flavorless. The only taste from my sandwich was from the mustard that I added and the onions. Waffle fries were pretty good, especially after dumping a sandstorm of Old Bay seasoning on top first and gluing it down with Heinz."}
{"text":"So I stopped in here at the airport in Charolette for breakfast surprisingly, basically because it was the only thing opened.  It wasn't bad.  Bacon and Sausage omelet.  Pretty good, the eggs were dry.  Service was good.  TV's available and the restaurant did have a bar available as well."}
{"text":"So bad it hurts . Ordered \"Parmesan and Rosemary crusted chicken tenders\" Apparently that means take the cheapest commercial pre breaded chicken tenders you can find and throw supermarket parm on top that doesn't stick. No Rosemary in the dish. Just a joke - level of effort at even trying to provide edible food 2/10"}
{"text":"What a ripoff! I got a crab soup togo, it was maybe 8 oz, the cup was not even filled up for $7. And, it was not very tasty, not even close to what I expected. The deli 100 ft down the concourse is priced at $4,  I'll go there from now on."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Crab Cobb salad was nice.  Carb is dropped on the top of the salad.  Crab soup... ah skip it.  It's pretty basic and bland."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations but I was disappointed in the lobster bisque soup.  Way too salty and no lobster.   Dumped pepper into it to try to cut the saltiness.   The fried shrimp was good."}
{"text":"Crab cake sliders are the way to go if you have a layover in Charlotte. It can get busy so make sure you have a minimum of 45 minutes between flights."}
{"text":"I know it is the airport....I'm not expecting excellence. BUT a place known for seafood should at least have quality seafood.  I found the tuna to be a bit tough, almost steak like. The flavors weren't bad, but it just wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"What the hell? Cheap plastic silverware! At least have some that's doesn't bend with mashed potatoes never mind food with more consistency. Ordered the 6oz filet with lobster, It was not a filet! (I butcher my own meats I'm very familiar with different cuts of meats) everything was like warm. Can blame being busy the restaurant was only about 1/3 full. The lobster bisque was very good but again luke warm. I hadn't been through CLT in awhile hopefully this was a fluke? Not what I'm accustomed to from any of the Phillips Seafood restaurants"}
{"text":"If a Long John Silver's were a Chili's...  Solid choice as long as you choose something fried and get a beer."}
{"text":"If you have to be stuck in an airport- this is a great place to pass the time. I had mini crabcakes and waffle fries.  They were perfect. Brian was my server. He couldnt possibly have been any more polite, or more efficient.  He was a 5 star server.  I would definitely go straight there the next time I was at the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"I stoping by at ceacars food court just looking for quick food which is i didn't normally do . In not too many choice I chose phillip seafood . Not much choice on the menu so i made my decision quick i got Crab cake & crispy shrimp platter for 13$ and lobster bisque and i also order crab cake biscuits but it was out :(  for the platter it came with 5 crispy shrimp ,1 crab cake and side of asian slaw waffle fries. It was reasonable quality fast food . But lobster bisque was not that impressed"}
{"text":"Horrible! The salad veggies looked like they had been frozen and thawed. The ranch and tarter looked like it had a film overtop from sitting out. The crab cake was awful! This is the first time I recall ever spitting food in my napkin. My plastic fork broke off in my rock hard fried fish and the Cole slaw was warm. We couldn't even eat the meal and the waitress never once acknowledged it. Worst $90 I've ever spent!"}
{"text":"Located in the newly renovated food court at Caesars Palace. Their Caesar salad is better than the one at Earl of Sandwich (also in the food court). Present your Total Rewards card to save $1 off each menu item.  (01/02/2015)"}
{"text":"Great place to stop and have a little seafood and a quick beer between flights. Nice salads and very healthy portions. They were right next to where i had to wait for my next flight, so it was a no brainer and a nice treat. Some people took their food to go. Lots of angry faces when they took out their food.  Lol !"}
{"text":"I'm always hesistant when it comes to table service restaurants inside airports in fear that it'll take too long and I'll miss my flight. I stopped into Phillips seafood because it was right next to my gate and i LOVE CRAB CAKES. As soon as I sat down Jessica was at my table ready to take my drink order, and the restaurant was not empty. The service was friendly and attentive. The food was really good. I had the premium crab cake with a glass of wine. The meal at this restaurant made me one happy flier."}
{"text":"How bad was our meal ?  List could go on forever. Crab soup tasted like pure salt. 1/2 pound burger - maybe if Earth's gravity was a lot greater. Waffle fries only tasted like fish. Crab cake was mushy and burnt on the outside   Service slow to non existant. And expensive. Take a BIG pass if in Charlotte airport"}
{"text":"They do a good job getting you in and out.  I had lobster bisque, pretty decent and tasty.  Ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheeses.   Good stuff but I have had better, then again, it is airport food, my expectations were not really that high.  I really like their table tin of Phillips Seasoning.   I added to my shrimp."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious! The grilled chicken was moist in the ABCLT. The crab cake was also wonderful - lots of lump crab meat and not too much of the binding ingredients that would weigh it down. The side vegetables and the seasonings were spot on. Did not need to adjust any seasonings with the salt, pepper, or seafood spice. Being in an airport setting, it was a busy time at linh, but our waitress did a great job circling to all tables and checking in with our needs. Great experience and would go back again!"}
{"text":"Read the Yelp reviews and decided the overall 3-stars eating could be ok airport food.  At 9am they were only serving Breakfast items & soups.  The waitress said both their Creamy Crab soup & Crab bisque was cream based (I thought bisque was tomato paste based).  I got the Creamy Crab soup & was really unimpressed.  It's creamy but no crab flavors.  There were small amts of tiny pieces of celery and almost no crabmeat. Bad idea."}
{"text":"Don't consider this overpriced bland airport food! This is the BEST crab soup, ever!  Delicious lumps of crab meat in a cream based soup with just a touch of Phillip's Seafood Seasoning to awaken my taste buds! I was only halfway done with the soup and I already wanted seconds --- it was THAT good. Must try the crab cakes on my next visit!!!  Looks like this is a east coast based franchise with restaurant locations in Atlantic City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Rockville and Washington, D.C.

{"text":"We had breakfast here during a layover at the airport. Our sever was awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He was so nice and polite with his North Carolina accent and hospitality. The Bloody Marys were really good and one of the better ones that I have had in a long time. I ordered the omelet with crab for breakfast and thought it was very good if you like crab. I would definitely come back if I were on a layover. I think it is one of the better food places in the airport."}
{"text":"While playing the slots at Caesars, we stopped at the food court because it's convenient and lobster rolls was calling the Husband's name. He grabbed a roll with the waffle fries for $14.99. This was a treat. We live in an area that lobsters or any kind of seafood aren't readily available, except a Red Lobster that we would drive 45 minutes to, so already this was a win/win for us.   It wasn't the best that he EVER had but again, we were already there. They had sold lobster rolls else where on the trip for easily twice as much and we were unwilling to walk elsewhere. Not bad quality for the price that you pay. The claw meat seemed fresh. The roll was ok; could be better. It was filling and satisfying. Husband was extremely pleased.  Great thing there wasn't a line and he got the food in a timely manner. I took off a star because the cashier gave us a bit of attitude. She talked really fast like she had better things to do then take our order."}
{"text":"Flight delayed and starving so I stopped by this place for my seafood fix. Wow masculine bartender female, you're really a (insert word of your choice here).  Yes, there's nothing worse when you know someone is only nice to you so they can get your money. So when you order at the bar \"to-go\" and they completely ignore you and won't even get you the glass of water they offered you while waiting, it just confirms what I said before.   You can totally tell their fake customer service and their fake chit-chat small talk is a poor attempt to solicit tips.  I had the crab cakes & egg breakfast combo. It smelled weird and turned me of but for the price I forced myself to eat it on the plane, and the food itself, is okay...."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly.  You must try the lobster roll and the shrimp po boy. Good prices"}
{"text":"It's an  airport restaurant, so don't expect elegance. At the same time,  the Mahi-Mahi was delicious ( vegetables were bland / mashed potatoes were ok. ) And the waitress was attentive. No reason for me not to go back if I'm in this airport again. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"5 stars for the outstanding customer service!  I've found Phillips to be dependable for a solid airport breakfast here in Charlotte and in other airports as well.  But I've never had such amazing service in an airport.  Ever.  I had just gotten off a redeye from Denver and was bleary and foggy and in serious need of a black coffee injection.  I stopped into this Phillips since I've had decent experiences in other airports, and they are very accommodating of my substitution requests (no potatoes, bread, thank you very much).  The food was good, the coffee was black and always kept warm.  Here's the outstanding part:  I tried paying, and i had some issue with my card. It would absolutely not go through, and there was nothing I could do. I didn't have cash or another credit card. Yikes!!!!  The manager came over and just very kindly told me that he would take care of it.  And that I didn't need to pay.  WHAT??!! Amazing!  I got their address so I can send not only the tab, but I will be sending some flowers or gifts, and especially tip my waitress since I jipped her with my not-paying-ness.  I will be their regular whenever I'm in CLT.  Seriously.  At the airport!?  AWESOME."}
{"text":"The food was partially good but it took 10-20minutes just to come out and then the food wasn't even hot!! Plus the portions were ok!!! Food was greasy!! And cold!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just bad. Bad service and so slow. I ordered a water with lemon and received in 10 minutes later. The salad took at least 20 minutes to come out!  #itsjustasalad"}
{"text":"Food was pretty bad. I had the lobster roll and it was the worst. Tiny amount of what looked like chunk light tuna on a bed of shredded lettuce. My wife had crab soup that was just okay. Add one beer and one margarita and bill was $53. Service was good though."}
{"text":"I'll start this review by saying that I'm giving 4 stars because the crab Cake Sandwich was so damn good!   I haven't read any previous reviews, so forgive any redundancy.   I can only imagine that the rating on this place isn't higher because of service and time wasted waiting on food!?! I don't really have that complaint as my crab cake sandwich & fries didn't take too long.... though I certainly  put myself in front of the server twice to ensure that she'd remember me; to quickly take my order and deliver my check as quickly as possible!  I'll leave a \"tip\" to have your order in mind and ask for the check the moment your food is delivered.  Also, pay cash so that you can quickly get the heck outta there!!"}
{"text":"I stop by regularly...always great food, fast and superb service. I ordered the Phillips Seafood Sampler and the Lobster Bisque soup. The soup was a bit watery, but had a great flavor. Outstanding job by my server Colleen!!"}
{"text":"It was really early, like not even 6 am early and after a night without dinner or snacks, I wanted to sit down in a nicer restaurant. I love seafood, so I picked Phillips.  I should have known from the sign that said Pasterized Crab Meat. I'm a crab lover and being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I always have access to fresh crab. This was not the case.   With a limited menu, I ordered the Cream of Crab Soup and an Ice Tea. It came up fast and service was friendly, but the soup was wayyyy over seasoned and the crab tasted dehydrated. Biting into crab chunks that seemed to break apart like powder chunks. I stopped trying to eat it after about 5 spoonfuls.   I drank about 2 large ice teas and 2 large waters to get the overpowering salty seasoning taste from my mouth. The unsweetened ice tea is good, yet not worth stopping in when there is a lot offered in this airport.   The worse part is the aftermath of a stomachache and sick feeling that lasted for the next 10-12 hours. If I wasn't already feeling tired and hungry, add sick to that and it wasn't worth it at all.    Even if you like canned crab, I wouldn't recommend Phillips for anyone."}
{"text":"First off I respect this place for serving Bloody Marys' and mimosas so early in the morning everyday. I think they have an understanding that brunch isn't only reserved for Sundays.   They serve breakfast here until 10 am. So don't be fooled by the exterior signage. I had to actually glance at someone plate as I walked by and noticed eggs! I was delighted to see that they had breakfast!!  For my fellow vegetarians: there is a veggie omelet option comes with broccoli, peppers and I believe cheese.   If you order coffee... You can get refills! You know you need it if you got up at 4:30 a.m. To get in a flight at 5:45 a.m. Get your caffeine up ladies and gents!   The service here is friendly and the pricing is decent and by that I mean it's about $10 a plate."}
{"text":"Located in the newly remodeled food court at Caesars Palace. My friends and I stayed at Caesars and wanted to grab a quick bite before we went clubbing, I wasn't that hungry so I was gonna just split with whatever my friend wanted to order. She decided on the lobster roll and I was hesitant at first, but I'm really glad she got it. One of the best lobster rolls I've had.! Came with huge chunks and a really really generous portion of lobster!! The waffle fries were also good! Can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu! Oh and everything is about $1 off if you have a total rewards card!"}
{"text":"Nice sandwich selection with fresh ingredients. Side salad has lots of tomatoes, carrots onions...very nice, not your standard skimpy side salad. Staff was very friendly and patient. Great little airport sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster bisque...it wasn't pleasant. Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's OK, but a little pricey for crab and everything else. Have a $20.00 nil it better on you for just food. The service is probable the best part overall. The taste and flavor is ok, but needs more seasoning and flavor. The drafts are the best part."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, most of the time it is when I am playing poker and they are close to the Poker Room. Today made it a 3 star for me over a 4 star.   The lobster roll's are quite good, better than most, but not as good as Cousin's Maine but better than I have elsewhere in Vegas.   The shrimp, not so great frozen and pre breaded, cocktail sauce is pre-made sealed store bought.  The crab cakes and crab soup were also good, close to very good, but not quite there.   The fires are VERY good.   The lobster bisque is quite good, I have had it multiple times and have liked it each time, today they were out of the bisque so I had he soup and who I was with had the crab and shrimp platter.   The price isn't bad at all, especially considering it is in a top level strip casino. I have paid more for the same quality of food at mall more than once before."}
{"text":"Crab cake - ok. Fried Cod (fish & chips or as sandwich) - light, not greasy and unexpectedly awesome! Waitress could've been more friendly and listened (asked her 3x for water and she was off without really hearing us)"}
{"text":"Go ahead and get yourself a A.B.C.L.T. It was fantastic. The waffle fries are very crispy...yeah, they were good. Great spot if your down toward the end of concourse C. Leila was my server and her accent was awesome...Brazilian."}
{"text":"On a layover at the Charlotte Airport and weather in Boston had us delayed, so I stopped in here for lunch. Someone else said frozen and reheated and yep, that's how I would describe it too. I'm a big fan of crabcakes and when you put the word \"crab\" so big on the side of your restuarant, I expect goodness. Instead, I got weakness, though I will give points for a good crab soup (though I didn't eat too much, it was a little much). I was a little bummed to not be getting to take advantage of the brunch dishes, they had crab omelettes on the menu and I have had some good ones in the past that I would have loved to see if they measured up (doubt they woulda though)"}
{"text":"On The Strip and looking for a quick meal, I stumbled across Phillips Seafood. The food court had plenty of other options but a fresh lobster roll appealed the most to me.   Despite the steep price, I attributed to the location of the restaurant, I opted for a lobster roll and fries.   Ordering, the service was just okay, definitely nothing to give props about.   Upon receiving my order, I immediately noticed the crab Robbin ratio was off. The bun was extremely thick, the lettuce was sad and wilted. The crap mixture itself was fine. There were large pieces of lobster, which I appreciated.  Despite being on the strip, I do feel as though the prices are a bit exaggerated for the food they give you."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so you know what to expect -- even from this airport location.  But Phillips does make a decent (although a bit greasy) crabcake!  The mashed potatoes are good, too."}
{"text":"airport food has changed - good quick service - fresh made lunch dishes - nice atmosphere although in an airport - wide array of fresh seafood on the menu"}
{"text":"This location is in the airport and I can never figure out why a successful restaurant chain, any of them, can't figure out how to have a great location at the airport! I have been to the original Phillips crab house in Maryland many many times and it is phenomenal. Every thing , every time is great BUT this airport location was just ehh. The service was terrible and slow. Which again I can not understand. We are at the airport, EVERY PERSON is on a time crunch at the airport. Why can I not be greeted quickly and receive food quickly? The crab soup wasn't bad. Good flavor and lots of crab. But the crab sliders had no taste. Not what I expected from the name Phillips."}
{"text":"Food is ok....fried too hard...wouldn't go back. Service is good staff is friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Crab cake lived up to its billing. Sides were also quite good. Drinks weren't strong (Even Doubles). Mediocre service but what can you expect at Airports? Not a great airport bar ambiance, dimly light, TVs aren't great."}
{"text":"Thai Springs rolls were great, and just like I've enjoyed at actual Thai restaurants.  Service was great and fast, friendly staff and cold beer.  If you 30 min to spare in C concourse in Charlotte give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Dish was large for an airport restaurant. Crab cakes were good!"}
{"text":"Really good choice to grab a quick breakfast during a layover before next flight. The food was fast and hot, the food was nothing out of the norm. I had regular eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon and sausage. The service was clean and friendly. I left a generous tip for the customer service. I would recommend this place for a simple breakfast at the airport. The bar was open but I did not drink and it was not crowded and you were able to seat yourself."}
{"text":"Being from Baltimore and knowing what to expect, the cod sandwich was just ok, and pretty thin piece of cod. Had more bread than fish. Fries were great. But don't be fooled in thinking its authentic. But what do y expect in a food court."}
{"text":"While waiting for the buffet, the bf and I decided to grab a small snack to hold us over..  Well, this was anything but small...  The lobster roll is what you would pay at a food truck but what you get in return is a huge roll, lobster every bite. The bread was perfected buttered and toasted and the tartar sauce was the perfect dip. The roll also came with criss cut fries which are my favorite! I will definitely come back next time to get my own roll! But really even sharing it is a lot of food and I am very happy :)  Best lobster roll yet."}
{"text":"Phillips Seafood is one of Caesar's restaurants located in their food court.  I was hungry, got in line, and asked the cashier what she recommended.  She said that the lobster roll is really good and it's also their highest seller. That being said, I got their Mahi Mahi Sandwich with waffle fries. The sandwich looked good, but tasted like cardboard.  My meal had no taste at all with the exception of the waffle fries.  Take my advice, stay away from Mahi Mahi Sandwich. After my meal, I walked by Phillips Seafood and the cashier asked me if I enjoyed my sandwich.  I lied and told her it was okay.  Her response \"you should have gotten the lobster roll\".  Tip to Self: If there's a next time, listen to the cashier.  2016 Yelp Review #21"}
{"text":"Overpriced crap. I ordered the sampler and left half of it there. It was greasy. It was over cooked. The crab cakes were terrible. I would call them salt cakes but that would minimize how badly they otherwise tasted. On the bright side, when I walk past this place on my way to future flights I'll have a spring in my step.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a snack and the lobster roll was perfect! This place is located near the forum shops at Caesars Palace. It's a food court so you will have to order and bring your own food to the table and clean up afterwards like any other food court. I ordered the traditional lobster roll. Our cashier was super friendly. After you order, you will get a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready. My food came out promptly. It was very noisy since it is located in the casino. The restaurant was convenient for me since I stayed at Caesars Palace. The bread was soft and buttery and you a good amount of lobster. I would recommend others to try it. The lobster roll came with waffle fries which was alright."}
{"text":"My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.  You're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here."}
{"text":"Below average Lobster roll. I picked this place because I had a descent meal there before but was quite disappointed with my visit today. The staff and place are ok for an airport but the food wasn't good - I ordered the Roll and it came with waffle fries that tasted like oil and they were cold. The roll came with this tiny pieces of lobster and it didn't even taste good. I'll probably avoid next time and will pick one of the other several places in the airport."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! My breakfast (crab cakes and eggs) was Delish! And the service was friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Had the miniature crabcakes and the citrus peppercorn mahi ...loved them ...fantastic customer service too"}
{"text":"Cold Tuna, frozen vegetables, unremarkable service!  I travel constantly, so I notice the small stuff as well as the big stuff.  In my second trip to this Phillips I was hoping for a better experience tan my first.  Next time, I think I will save the dough and just go to CPK ASAP in terminal B."}
{"text":"Can't say anything on the food since I waited 10 minutes and no one acknowledged me. Waited by the front for a hostess; nothing so another patron suggested seating myself, no problem. Sat at table for ~10 minutes, was not acknowledged even as I noticed the lady who came in at least 5 minutes after me both place a drink and food order and was sitting one table over :/ At bad daddy's up the terminal and am having a much better experience, skip Phillips and head there instead"}
{"text":"Positives- friendly staff. The crab soup good.  Was better than rest of menu. Cons- fried shrimp and veggies from frozen package.  Crab cake average sitting on lettuce covered with oil. Maybe the burgers are better. Not worth the price ... soup / 1 beer / fried shrimp = $45 ouch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a couple hours between flights. Ordered the fish and chips platter with waffle fries and coleslaw. The cod was pretty good although for the price the portion was small. Overall it was pretty tasty. My waiter sucked. Never once came back to see if I needed anything else."}
{"text":"Over priced & bland. I ordered the mini crab cakes & a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was comparable to eating plain cabbage & mayo. The crab cakes were over cooked on the outside & cold, flavorless  mush in the center. Even with lemon, the house seasoning, & their chipotle ranch dipping sauce.... I was only able to get 1/3 down. I know that this is an airport restaurant, but in a pinch, it's still nice to have the option to get a decent meal (especially for $40) Luckily my server Malesa, was awesome & attentive & took the crab cakes off of my bill. Her service was the best part of my meal!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite and a drink.  Staff was very friendly, which is hard to find in an airport restaurant.  My company paid for the meal so I didn't care about the prices."}
{"text":"I would have called the restaurant directly, but Phillips offers no telephone numbers!!!  I contracted food poisoning from the calamari I ate 2 hours ago at the Charlotte airport location. I was forced to use a form on the Phillips website asking them to please contact the restaurant to tell them NOT TO SERVE IT TO ANYONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I am vomiting and have diarrhea. I am extremely unhappy and will never again dine at a Phillips.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"I typically dont visit food court places but we wanted something quick and casual so the nearby Caesars Palace food court was the most obvious answer.  Not in the mood of eating burgers or pizza which was the choice of everyone else in the group, I regrettably decided to give Phillips Seafood a chance. I ordered the crab soft pretzel that is described as a freshly baked pretzel with crab and cheeses.  It looked ok but it went downhill fast once I started eating it. First there is no discernible crab flavor.  At first I thought they left out the crab by mistake but then realized the crab was shredded up and mixed into this awful cheese sauce mixture that was about 20% undetectable crab, 80% nasty cheese sauce. Secondly, as mentioned this cheese sauce was nasty!  Even my wife who loves cheesy foods nearly gagged after having a taste. Thirdly the pretzel was a combination of under-cooked in the interior and the nasty cheese sauce made it soggy... an inedible combination.  This was the first time in recent memory that something was so awful that I had to throw it out after a couple of bites and it would have been even fewer bites if I wasn't trying to taste the crab."}
{"text":"The service was great. However Lobster bisque was unfortunately the worst I have ever eaten. The consistency was super thick, a mix of starch, whipped cream and at most a lobster stock, no pieces at all. On top, it was extremely over-salted. I feel sick. Sorry not to recommend at all."}
{"text":"My BF and I were stuck in Charlotte for the night and headed back to CLT for another round of airport food.  Phillips was in concourse C, where we were waiting for our flight.  I ordered a salad, which was decent and my BF ordered a appetizer sampler dish.  (See photo)  It consisted of 3 teeny tiny crab-cakes, 4 small egg rolls, and 4 breaded shrimps.  Pathetic!  The food tasted like it was frozen and reheated.  The seafood egg roll was the worse.  It tasted awful.  The tiny crab-cakes were good and I would have taken more of those over the egg rolls.  Our server was nice and cheerful."}
{"text":"Eh /shrug.  That about sums it up.   Their Phillips Amber Ale was pretty ok.  The service was what you'd expect from a airport restaurant. And the food was definitely better than any of the \"fast food\" options you are bound to be tempted to try at the airport.  I ordered the crabcake and had it tossed into a toasted bun.  The crake cake was cooked on the grill (not deepfried) which was definitely a plus.  The crab was light and flavorful and was definity worthy of ordering again.  Overall, not a bad spot to come grab a beer and a bite if you are between flights in Charlotte and have a hankering for some crab."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I've actually been to Phillips Seafood in the DC/Maryland area, so it was with great pleasure that I got to dine on their delicious crab cakes and crab soup while at the airport.  Of course, being in an airport, there's not much to say about ambiance.  It is loud and crowded, but that is to be expected.  Servers are consistently quick and pleasant.  The food is always great.  It is a bit on the high priced side, but you (or in my case, my company) are paying for quality seafood.  Can't wait for my next trip back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Meh Meh Meh. The first time I stopped by this joint the air conditioning wasn't working. There can be nothing worse than some place in an airport that makes you *less* comfortable.   The last time I tried it was fixed. So I sat down and had two shots of something potent. That, my friends, is how I should approach airport food from now on. Get me lit up first, then I can enjoy the unenjoyable. Beer goggles for food is what you need. But that would never work for the likes of Burger King - it does work for Phillips.   So I had some kind of fish sandwich with a decent mayo/tarter sauce and slaw. A sit down meal. But I would have liked an oyster poboy. Put it on the menu, dudes. And keep that A/C on."}
{"text":"I had a massive layover so I decided to look for a good meal. Seafood looked good and different than typical airport fare. I ordered the steamed shrimp as an appetizer, and it was good if you don't mind peel n eat. House wine is decent, a bit pricey but acceptable. For my main course I ordered the combo platter.....eeh it was ok. I'd probably stick to something closer to my gate next time"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place while waiting for my next flight. The waitress was nice and the food was good. This was my first time eating at a place like this and I felt as if I was at a normal restaurant. I didn't have the feeling of being in an airport. If there is a local location outside of the airport, it would be interesting to see if there is a difference in the service. I will definitely revisit this place during future my travels."}
{"text":"Situated next to the Forum shops in ceaser's newly rennovated food court, phillip's seafood is reasonable. $14 for a lobster roll.    i was expecting to see a crab roll, instead they offered a crab cake roll.  It can be noisey as it is a food court but overall, great place to get a quick fix of seafood on the go. \"Express\""}
{"text":"Ordered the salt and pepper calamari to tide me over and a glass of pinot grigio.  No hint of salt or pepper on what once upon a time might have been calamari.  Thank god for Oregon and its pinots.  Memo to self: dont change planes in Charlotte if you will be needing feeding."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Had 20 minutes to eat before next flight. Love the cream of crab soup. Crab and shrimp spring rolls were good too. They are more like egg rolls than what I would think a traditional spring roll to be."}
{"text":"Though the place was a buzz - I managed to find a nice table for two along the garage door windows and picked up on the Charlotte Airport FREE internet allowing me to get caught up on my \"Check Ins\".   Service was extremely fast and my drink and food were at my table before I could even log on to my lap top - even though it was busy  The place seemed clean and my waiter was fast, friendly and came through on all my special requests. The blackend Ahi Tuna was cooked perfectly, the waffle fries might have been a touch on the cold side, the cole slaw was a bit larger in size then I prefer, but the taste was great. The four little hushpuppies rounded out the meal bringing the meal to a solid 3 stars.  Putting it altogether - the speed of the food and the service brings this place to a 4 star!"}
{"text":"Phillips,Phillips,Phillips..  If you are not use to Seafood properly prepared  then this is the place for you! I ordered the Fried seafood trio;  Maryland Crab cakes, Calamari, Fried Shrimp, and subbed waffle fries for Hush Puppies (best decision of the night!!!) The Crab cakes were not awful  but they could have added a little Soul to the mix. (Genuine Maryland Crab) The Shrimp small and way to much breading (no flavor) The Calamari was seasoned well!!  But was also cooked to well.  (way over cooked and predominately tentacles) The Hush Puppies were my absolute Fave  good flavor compared to their counterparts but not good enough to order separate. All in All..Very repugnant  (You will feel sick by the time you are half way through)"}
{"text":"Well there goes my lobster bisque...I guess I should have checked the bag before taking off. Service is a bit slow but food is good (well, I wouldn't know what their bisque is like)"}
{"text":"This was the closest restaurant to my gate and I was starving. The bartender (who was very friendly)  unfortunately miss informed me on the portion sizes.  I ordered the lobster bisque and was told the bowl was pretty shallow so she recommends ordering an additional entre.I opted for the shrimp salad with the pineapple chipotle sauce.   The soup: delicious. The salad: weird.  I think the salad had way too much going on and was unappetizing. I loved all components separately but together they do not work well.  My main issue is the price. While I can get past a bad salad, I can't get past a salad that was almost $20. Ridiculous. It was a huge portion, but a huge portion of nasty."}
{"text":"The lobster roll had just come out of the freezer. I threw it out after a couple bites and went to Di Fara for pizza. The food was terrible and I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Phillips Seafood is just one of a few handfuls of regional restaurants located in Charlotte airport that make this airport such a pleasure to fly through, as the food options here are such a welcome departure from the standard McDonalds and Sbarro (indeed, with the varied food options, free wifi, restroom attendants, live piano music and comfy rocking chairs, CLT is the only airport to which I've given a solid 5 stars).  I stopped at this restaurant to grab a quick bite during a 1 1/2 hour layover.  I had a seat at the bar and was quickly attended to by Angela. She asked what I wanted, I requested a menu and she grabbed one from the next customer over and handed it to me. Lol.  I ordered a 9 oz pour of Chardonnay and an order of miniature crab cakes with chipotle ranch dressing.  She sat out a wine glass and proceeded to dump (I mean that literally) a full and generous 9 ounce pour into it. She was awesome all night and I loved her personality!    Chardonnay was $12/ glass and the crab cakes were $10.99 which was fair, especially for airport fare which can be pricey in some cities due to the ol' \"supply and demand\" rule.   The crab cakes were tasty, but the ranch was a bit overpowering and the bed of lettuce the crab cakes were served on was a little brown and wilted.  It should be noted that, while they had ceramic plates, patrons are given black plastic forks and knives to dine with.  This Phillips Seafood location has 1 TV on each end of the bar and a few hanging in other areas of the restaurant, but on this night they had the same programming on all of them and the channel selection wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Hungry after a flight back to the States from Aruba, we stopped here for a quick bite to eat before our next flights. I ordered the fish and chips. Fish were a few block shaped pieces, slaw was bland (I took one bite only), fries were decent. Tartar sauce was okay, I had to task for cocktail sauce. Service was fine. We used the plug outlets on the wall outside of the bar to charge our phones, no one ever bothered us about it. This place will do if your hungry while traveling."}
{"text":"The crab cakes here are definitely above average, and considering that this is a restaurant in an airport, a nice find indeed.  I would have given this restaurant another star based on the food, but unfortunately I had a poor service experience.  The sign said \"seat yourself\" so I did, and then two of the waitstaff not 10 feet away from me got into an argument with each other over whose table I was sitting at.  Unfortunately, I got the more aggressive one (the one who had no qualms about starting the argument right in front of the customer in the first place), who was quite pushy about trying to get me to order the most expensive items on the menu, appetizers, desserts, etc. (I was by myself at lunchtime) but took 15 minutes to bring me my drink order.  The prices are expensive.  The food merits that price level, but the service definitely does not."}
{"text":"Service is marginal at best. But it is an airport bar...but to be served old lettuce(it included the core such wad Brown) and a tomato that should have ripened 5 more days, not to mention the green snot like substance on which the lettuce was thrown on (avocado by the way) the first round of this salad was horrific! I sent it back. The second try was fresher...but why on earth would you destroy a perfectly good avocado like that?  My bad for ordering a salad. The guy next to me got the salmon. It's over cooked. Chef Ramsey...where are you?"}
{"text":"Dry fish and service is horrible, i was there on April 3 7:30pm and the tender girl never smiled and was doing me a favour when helping me. Bad experience!"}
{"text":"I live in New England so I get excited about seafood restaurants. This place is not much better than fast food. Phillips should not have their name on it or require better quality. I travel through here almost every week and wish we had a better seafood choice next to my regular gates."}
{"text":"I got the Lobster Roll... it was so good and for the price... I AM HAPPY! :) There's lots of places to eat at the strip... and sometime people over look the food court.  I want more!"}
{"text":"You're not going to get exceptional seafood at this restaurant, but your craving for crab cakes or clam chowder will definitely be satisfied. Everything is made pretty fresh to order and the food is good. I really enjoyed the clam chowder because it was thick and chunky and had a really good flavor. Their sea food variety was pretty impressive, especially when considering that they are located in a casino food court."}
{"text":"I'm a real foodie but have never had a lobster roll. While on a layover in Charlotte, I was excited to see this on the menu board outside of Phillips, so we dropped in for a few drinks and dinner. The service was friendly, but a little slow (overwhelmed I think). The lobster roll was okay, but the fries were better. They just needed a little more seasoning, which is available right there on the table, so no biggie. My only real complaint was the drink prices. Holy moly! Don't say yes to \" Wanna make that a double?\" They're only referring to the price, not the amount of alcohol in the drink."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and substituted fries for veggies. Food was good. But don't expect a fillet or 2 of fish. It was 3 nuggets. 3 nuggets.  I guess they figure you will depend on fries and cole slaw to make up for volume. But the 3 nuggets of fish were tasty and actually so were the veggies. And waiter was fast. Asked for check and had it before the food showed up."}
{"text":"Banish the notion that you're going to get a real lobster roll here.  That was a mistake!  I'd go elsewhere if I had the time. I did not so I kinda ate here mid-day on Monday. Located at gate C13.   Crab chowder/cream of crab soup was actually very good, tasting of crab and served hot without lumps of flour glopping it up. I'd recommend that soup even if it is pricey, but hey it's an airport.   Lobster roll was awful. Fortunately waitress took it off my bill -- and offered a cup of water to go(!). Unfortunately I didn't get to eat more than two bites. I lived in Maine and this is not a Maine lobster roll. It is ground up seafood saturated in fat on a proper toasted hot dog bun. It tastes horrid.  Next time I plan to high tail it over to Bojangles in concourse B."}
{"text":"As I wanted a nice meal before countless hours ahead of me seeing Calvin Harris (at OMNIA Nightclub), I figure a seafood place will get the job done. Located directly in the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace, this was the only restaurant that offered seafood. My lady and I weren't looking for a sit-down waiter type of place but something where I could go up, order, and get my food in less than 10 minutes.  This takes me to \"Phillips Seafood Express\". This is a place I have never heard of prior to coming here (even though they have a few locations in Atlantic City NJ, Baltimore MD, and Ocean City MD), I didn't really have high expectations about this place. Well this place is pretty much like a food court in a mall or airport; you go up in a very loud atmosphere, pay an inflated amount of dough, and wait until your order is ready.  Since my lady decided on ordering Mexican food at nearby \"La Gloria\",  I was the only one dining here. I ended up ordering their \"Classic Lobster Roll\" (for $17.99). This roll includes a basket of waffle fries. I also opt for just a soda (which is an insanely expensive $4.49) and total for this came out to about $24. Ouch! Service is forgettable as the cashiers remind me of kids working at the mall. I was given a pager and my meal (w/drink) arrives in about 10 minutes.  I must say, I was not satisfied with my lobster roll at all. There were only bits and pieces of the lobster while it was smothered in too much of the tarragon mayonnaise while there was too much damn lettuce. The roll itself was decent but when you're primarily eating bread, mayo, and lettuce, it doesn't add up to a quality meal. The only thing this place really had going for it was their waffle fries as these were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside.  I do have to say this you definitely do NOT get your money's worth on the lobster roll for nearly $20. I would save your money and take your $20 to a nearby slot machine to see if you have luck winning. I understand that this is a tourist trap area but c'mon guys, be generous with the lobster! And make it tasty so us out-of-towners leave happy! Anyhow, there are WAY better places to dine at this food court (and at Caesars Palace for that matter). My rating for \"Phillips Seafood Express\", a below average two-stars."}
{"text":"Pretty marginal. Our group of 3 had the fish and chips (3 small flavorless cubes of fish), a fish sandwich  (also described as without significant flavor), and deep fried shrimp (described as akin to what one would get in a high school cafeteria). Way overpriced for the quality. I would rather eat at Burger King than return to this place!"}
{"text":"I was glad to see this place serving lunch early. After much debate, I had the lobster roll. I received two fairly decent sized rolls. What I got surprised me but I rechecked the menu and found it to not be misleading. The \"roll\" was like a modified piece of Texas toast. What normally would be slaw was lettuce. Meh. It was good, but lettuce is pretty cheap to be serving against lobster. Ice tea was fresh and awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat in the airport if you have more than an hour layover. I had the blackened Mahi - I was pleasantly suprised! The fish was good, veggies were cooked but still crisp, and the potatoes must have been horrible for me because they tasted awesome. I'd definitely come back. Service was good as well. I was working on my laptop (a restaurant no-no, but I felt justified since I was in the airport)."}
{"text":"My husband and I needed just a quick bite to eat before we headed to dinner. You know the hungry but can't wait for 2 hours feeling? That was us!  We stumbled across Phillips in a very busy and loud food court area. Definitely not Vegas fine dining, but if you're looking for a quick bite to eat that is budget friendly this is the place to be.  The customer service was great and the overall appearance of the place was clean and organized.  My husband and I ordered the lobster rolls! We are huge lobster roll fans and this lobster roll hit the spot. It was delicious and they didn't cheat you out on the size or the amount of lobster! Well worth the price! The fries were also delicious seemed to be seasoned with some old bay which is also our favorite.  We enjoyed our quick bite to eat and will make this a Vegas go to tradition!"}
{"text":"Not sure what they are famous for except maybe bad food at high prices? Granted it is an airport so everything is pricey. I had a lobster bisque soup for $9 that tasted like watered down Campbell's canned soup. Actually Campbell's was better, I got a while two mini bits of lobster. Avoid"}
{"text":"Overpriced, salty, cold.  Server must be used to complaints because he never once asked how my food was.    Spent over $50 for a meal for myself that was bad.  Spent it for a meal served with a plastic fork and knife.   You have no idea what challenge means until you have tried to eat undercooked carrots with a fork whose times bend arourns the food you are trying to eat.  Finally started scooping them up with the side of the fork and knife.    Lobster was cold, salty, and served without drawn butter.  Steak was lukewarm, thin, and had some gristle.  Crab soup was salty to the point I added water, and not one tiny piece of crab in the bowl for $8.99.  Veggies were ok, but undercooked. Inly thing that was \"warm\" and somewhat flavorfull were the mashed potatoes.  Offered a becearge refill after.I finished the meal and my glass was empty for a good 15 minutes... And they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"Ordered the Crab and Shrimp platter. Line was a bit long, but it's Vegas. However, service was definitely a defining factor for this review.  Crab is not JUST crab: it's a crab cake. So don't come in thinking you're getting crab legs. The cake was alright, to be honest. There's big chunks of crab mixed with what tastes like hushpuppy. Their coleslaw, shrimp, and fries, however, are what made it for me.  With a platter, you get the option for 2 sides. I chose the waffle fries and coleslaw. Both were amazing: short and simple. I'd highly recommend it. The butterfly shrimp was very, very succulent. Served with tartar and cocktail sauce, the pairing is amazing.   What dropped this from a four was the service. The cashier was great. The cooks, however, forgot to add shrimp to my order. I paid about $18 for a hefty plate of food, and, upon receiving it, there was only a small crab cake and fries. I ended up having to wait a while for the cashier to yell at the cooks about messing up.   Quality good, service okay."}
{"text":"Came here to grab something to eat before a show, it's inside the food court at Caesar palace, get the lobster roll sandwich & crab cake & shrimp platter, come with waffle fries ...the lobster is pretty fresh and a good portion, a lot better than lobster me, and cheaper too, the crab cake & shrimp are delicious, lots of crab meat and the waffle fries is a killer...can't stop eating it, they use fresh potato...overall worth a try..."}
{"text":"The cod is bland and the rest of the platter was just very greasy. The crab cake was ok.  The food could be fresher for the price.  This is like the stuff you find in the freezer isle."}
{"text":"My first experience with Phillips was in Washington, DC on the waterfront, well over five years ago. I then dined in, again, at the Baltimore location in the BWI airport. My most Yelp-able experience has been in the airport in Charlotte, thus far. I know, it's for an airport restaurant; but, my stomach is most vulnerable when traveling.   Layover - schmayover!!! That's how I felt one day last year when trying to head to Atlanta to visit one of my best friends. I was indeed hungry, and all of the coffee chains and grease-boxes that did not appeal to my palate got to hear the echo of my luggage wheels, as I rolled right past them. It's mid-morning - do I really want a cheese-steak sub or pizza? Methinksnot.... so, I head over to Phillips and do a \"what the hay\" kind of shrug, while surveying all of the empty tables sprawled across the floor.   I was greeted with southern pleasantries, that immediately reminded me of my future destination - as a warm smile spread across my face. I ordered the crab-cake w/ scrambled eggs, fruit and a biscuit! Yum.... I was satisfied with something so simple, yet superb. I could now care less if I had to wait in that airport for the next three hours. The staff was ultra-friendly, and the food was fresh (not unusual for this chain), so I give it four stars. If I'm ever in town again, meaning in the airport, I know where to eat."}
{"text":"Phillips was located right across from my gate. I was early so I decided to grab a bite and have a view close enough to not get left. The service was quick. A server quickly asked me for my drink order and brought it out. After ordering the food it came shortly after. I had the Buffalo Shrimp and cole slaw. This is my first time ever having Buffalo Shrimp and I enjoyed them. The restaurant had lots of seating. A bar, high top tables and regular tables. Several people came in after I sat down so the area got crowded really fast. After the crowd gathered my server may have forgotten about me. I had to go find her because my flight was boarding. It's a nice place to grab a bite if you are hungry and don't want to stray far from your gate."}
{"text":"Water is $6!! WTH? Portions are really petty small compared to price.   I ordered the crab cake and lobster bisque. It came with waffle fries..  Taste was ok but portion was the problem"}
{"text":"Fast, clean, inoffensive, forgettable. The fish and chips were non-toxic; the iced tea was wet."}
{"text":"I liked the Lobster Roll with waffle fries. Delicious. Share it with the wife, she said there might be too much butter on the bread to overpower the lobster. Will get less butter or no butter next time when we order.    Still like the Lobster Roll.   Wife got the Crab Cake Sandwich and she liked it with the waffle fries too.  Came out to $27 even with tax.  Yes, sorta pricey, but so delicious.  Will come here again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Seafood restaurant in the airport at the end of Terminal C!   The service is pretty quick, the place is very clean and doesn't smell fishy, and the food is pretty good!   I really enjoyed the Clam Chowder and my waitress was fantastic!  Stop and have a beer! 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Worst lobster bisque ever. Was presented to me with the soup broken. And was recommended"}
{"text":"the food was fast-food quality. the service was initially prompt but very cold and when i actually needed the waitress to show up (like when i had to get to my flight and needed the bill), i had to physically go track her down. the only thing this place had going for it was 9 oz wine pours. And the fact that every place nearby is probably as bad or worse."}
{"text":"If a place other than a restaurant in the airport served the Fish & Chips I just had for $15.99 they would go out of business in less than a month.  $15.99 for Fish & Chips and got 3 small nuggets of battered fish each the size of a chicken nugget, wait one of them was actually smaller.  Only reason gave two stars was the bartender was pleasant.  They should be charged with larceny!"}
{"text":"The crab cakes where really good.  The service was good when we first sat down, but as they go busier, there was not enough staff to make sure everything was going smoothly.  There were several people that sat next to us that had to wait for someone to take their order.  So, if they're busy and your in a hurry, you might not want to stop."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Phillips Seafood at CLT for breakfast while I was waiting for my flight back to ATL. This is a chain that I have seen in various airports but was never able to try. Well, I am glad that I had the chance today. The restaurant was right next to my gate so that was super convenient.  The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly, welcoming me as I entered. My server, Alison, was friendly and efficient. In a word, great! I ordered hot water with lemon to drink and I was pleased when I received substantial sized lemon slices. I hate receiving super thin lemon slices that you can barely get any juice from. For my meal, I ordered the crab meat omelet which came with potatoes, and wheat toast (Texas toast is also an option). Yum!!! The potatoes were crispy and flavorful, simply amazing. The omelet comes with what they call crabby sauce which I requested to have on the side since honestly the name didn't quite sit well with me. However, the sauce was actually pretty tasty and I ended up pouring over the omelet which was stuffed with backfin crab and Swiss cheese. Delish!  Food is is hot and flavorful. Prices are reasonable (my omelet was less than $11). If you are traveling through Charlotte or any other location that has a Phillips Seafood, I recommend you drop in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas on a business trip and wanted some fast dinner. This place exceeded my expectations. I had the lobster roll with the waffle fries. Both were very good, the lobster roll has plenty of lobster in it. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The service was fast and that is what you want at the airport.  This is a branch from the main location and it just isn't the same.  The seafood wasn't the freshest and the flavor wasn't the best. For the location, it was ok."}
{"text":"I was not going to get fast food or any other option for food that I could get back at home. I never heard of Phillips, so with 30 minutes till boarding time, I hesitantly stopped in since I hadn't eaten all day.  I explained my situation to my server-  THANK YOU, DEREK for lightning fast service from taking my order to serving my food, getting my bill, and even having time to check in on me, all in less than 20 minutes! 5***** star service!!!!!!  It's not bad for airport food. If you think of it with any other mentality, it'll be like average diner food. I ordered the miniature crabcakes since crabcakes seem to be a signature dish. They were a bit dry, and crumbled apart too easily. It was flavorful though and definitely didn't need the tartar sauce. The seafood bisque hit the spot. It tasted like good comfort homemade soup that was made with hours of care over a stove. The hint of Phillips seafood rub in it added a slight kick."}
{"text":"Why do I keep subjecting myself to horrendous airport fare? I was in CLT for a layover and was famished. The only option near by gate was a frozen yogurt shop  and Starbucks. I then spied Phillips so walked it. The place was packed to the gills. Service was slow but considerate and very polite. I ordered a Cobb Salad with no bacon. 25 minutes later, the salad came with two sad looking pieces of bacon. It was taken away and 35 minutes later, the saddest looking salad reappeared. I tasted mostly minced eggs. I barely touched it. I read the reviews for the crab cakes so ordered an app. It was grease balls, not at all resembling a crab cake. 40.00 with tip and a soda water."}
{"text":"Only could comment on the one thing I got for take out. It was the crab soup. Had decent flavour but couldn't find any crab. Service was good for the couple of minutes wait but for the price I would rather just go to the Burger place across and get a burger.  Maybe sit down service and other items on the menu are better."}
{"text":"They had some good beer.  Coleslaw tasted like it was dipped in sewer water.  Average at best.  Blahhhhh.."}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant in between flights for a quick bite. I was recently food poisoned at The Tilted Kilt back Home so I decided to play it safe with a burger, especially while traveling. The burger was decent, cooked the way I like it, juicy but lacked seasoning. The waffle fries were really good. I'd try another location, just not the airport location."}
{"text":"Got the lobster roll and waffle fries. Walgreens fries were good after season with old bay. Lobster rolls.... no please no.... just regrettable. Honestly couldn't really tell it was lobster aside from the looks and the flavor wasn't there and overpowered by the lettuce which I asked them not to include. Sounds like a good idea, actually maybe not...but please don't bother with the lobster roll. Save that experience for the north west, find yourself a Luke's lobster at least."}
{"text":"This is in the food court at Caesars.  I got the fried fish sandwich with fries and a drink. It was about $14.   The fish sandwich was just ok.  Not realy great and the portions were pretty small.  The waffle cut fries were good though."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while  waiting for our flight. BIG. MISTAKE! The lobster bisque. Soup took 20 minutes to arrive and came out cold. They happily nuked it for me. It had a thick scum on top as if its been in that bowl for a year!!!  . My friend had a horrible burger. Poor quality meat and bun. Stale lettuce and tomatoes. He said.\"Burger King\" is better.   So it's 8:10pm and they close at 9pm. A girl stood in their entrance. And turned 6 people away.saying...\"we are closing soon and we can't serve anymore food\"( say what?)  We drank ice tea without meals but soon learned No MORE REFILLS! They were out of tea.  We wondered if the owner knows how much business they lose buy closing one hour earlier. We won't ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect to grab a bite when you don't want a big meal and are looking for something quick, somewhat healthy at a reasonably price.   Their soups are delicious.   Have been here a few times and will be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place at the airport. The price did not matter much. I thought Wow! A nice lobster roll, so I ordered. Worst lobster roll I ever had. Dried out and not sure it was lobster. I should have gone to Burger King like i originally thought. Maybe their other menu items are better? Service was prompt. DONT get the I think it was LOBSTER ROLL!"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, very reasonably priced, good selections, and fast polite service. Can get crowded though. Very diverse menu of apps, seafood, and American cuisine if you don't like seafood."}
{"text":"After going to Forum Shops, we walked towards self-parking and passed by the food court. Conveniently, I was hungry so, we decided to look around and find a quick bite to hold me over. Sometimes curiosity leads me to bad times.   I love lobster rolls and $20 is a good price for some of the best lobster rolls I've had. The lobster rolls here are $15 and comes with waffle fries - what a deal, right? But a bottled water is $6! WTH???  So, we got some lobster rolls. The taste of sadness in a bun. There were a few chunks of lobster and a side of about 7 waffle fries. The taste was forgettable. And, no, the $6 water was not extra refreshing. I didn't know it was possible to get HANGRY after eating."}
{"text":"In keeping with my go to spot at the airport I stopped at this location during my short layover. They pour very stiff cocktails here and the service is fast.  I didn't try any food this time but I have at other airports and was always pleased with what I got."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food. I had the tuna which was ok. People next to me had calamari that looked good and they said it was awesome."}
{"text":"Two bartenders and 1 food waitress who was terribly inexperienced and NOT friendly in the least.  Who ever owns this place needs to take Food Service 101.  Your losing money by the bucket full-but perhaps you don't care.  I never got my food (a salad ( after 30 minutes) and no sweetener for my Tea.  Don't bother stopping here folks."}
{"text":"I use to stop here often but after tonight no thanks. The place is not busy on a Friday evening at 8:15 , serve is terribly slow, food cold n stench to shrimp.  Watching my server walk by me 4 times look at me n keeps going well all want is the check.  Weak service and awful frozen seafood that is obviously out of date."}
{"text":"Good crab meat omelette! And the service was amazing! I popped in originally just for coffee since the nearby Starbucks was packed. When I told the waitress that I did want to try their breakfast but only had 15 minutes until my boarding time, she said she could have the kitchen whip out crab meat omelette in 2 minutes.. And she delivered! The food was well-cooked  and nicely presented.. it did not look rushed food at all. Before I left she even offered coffee to go. Got into my flight on time, with a happy tummy and fresh brewed coffee."}
{"text":"Traveling from Charlotte to Detroit and decided to stop into Phillips Seafood for lunch.  It was seat yourself, as the sign at the front of the restaurant read, so I grabbed an out of the way tabletop and sat down.  I was greeted a few minutes later by my server, who obviously had too many tables, which is NOT uncommon at airport restaurants.  My drink came out quickly but my food was another issue.  Since I was pressed for time, I decided to take my food to go and eat it on the plane.  I should have checked my order before I left because it was missing the crab.  I ordered a Crab Cobb and it was definitely missing the crab. Average salad missing the main ingredient and slow service is the reason for the 2 rating."}
{"text":"Nice servers. Amee helped me find a place with no glare, even though it was not one of her tables. Malessa was my server and she was also very nice!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get, which isn't much, but the quality if the jumbo lump crab cake is mouth watering good! Their bloody Mary's are pretty tasty but they should be at $14 a pop! I hope the double shots of vodka hold up for my flight! All in all, I'd love it if they had 2 crab cakes instead of only 1 in the crab cake dinner.  You definitely go away feeling hungry if you don't indulge in the sides."}
{"text":"I ordered the calamari basket with fries for $11.  I think this was  fair price for what I ordered.  1/3 of the basket was fried calamri (kind of dark brown instead of the usual fried brown) and the other 2/3 was full of fries.  Would I go here again?  Maybe since there aren't too many options inside of Caesars that's okay priced."}
{"text":"Didn't come in for the food, just a drink whilst waiting for a connecting flight. They close at 11:00, the beers on tap tasted old, flat and were served very warm. The bartender didn't seem to care either, and charged $17 for two beers? Really? Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Phillips is my go-to airport restaurant for CLT.  Located midway down Concourse C, Phillips had fast, friendly service, a full bar, and a convivial atmosphere.  This time through I started with a warming bowl of their Maryland crab soup which was creamy and smooth, but I wished it had more chunks of crab meat.  I always go for their crab cake dinner (I usually plump for the 2-cake option, but I'm trying to lose some of my own personal plump these days) and it was very good as usual.  Big pieces of lump meat, not much breading, the way a crab cake should be.  The accompanying cole slaw was mild and unassuming; and the waffle-cut fries were nice and crispy, flavored with Phillips Seafood seasoning.  A decent stop-off for lunch or dinner if you have enough time between connections."}
{"text":"3.99 for slaw. See photo. Pathetic. The whole idea of the food court is for folks to avoid getting ripped off. Two little pieces of cod and some waffle fries for $13 is inappropriate for a food court. And the basket didn't even come with slaw. You pay extra for that privilege. Hopefully the other establishments in the Caesars food court can bring better value."}
{"text":"Ok for a food court, fries and hush puppies were pretty good. Got the baked crab pretzel thought this could have been better, pretzel and crab should be a great combo not so much here. Kind of a pricy joint for a food court but you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"There aren't many great choices in the Charlotte airport - we thought we'd try the crabcakes (which they claim to be great), the coconut shrimp, and the calamari.  60 Minutes later, we wished we had forgone airport restaurant food and gotten our McDonald's fix.  The food quality was not great - calamari rubbery, coconut shrimp not very coconutty, crabcakes were sorta oily, and very expensive for what you get.  On a positive note, our server was speedy, it was crowded but our table was cozy."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the crab cake sliders. Too small for the bun and mushy. The waffle fries are good though"}
{"text":"For a quick snack this would be a good place to enjoy as you're waiting for your flight in the Charlotte airport. However I do not recommend the lobster bisque it is very watery yet tasteful very very little lobster. The buffalo shrimp was very heavily breaded and will set your mouth on fire."}
{"text":"Located most of the way down the C Concourse at CLT, Phillips has been here for a while and I've just never had a hankering for seafood until today. A queue was waiting at the hostess stand, but there were seats open at the bar, so I headed there. Same food, same drinks. Why not?  I just had a soda water (which he apologized after accidentally refilling with plain water) and a bowl of their excellent she crap soup. The soup was great and for airport food, reasonable at $9. A soda water (basically, Coke without the syrup), a bit expensive at $2.50.  Seafood tends to be expensive no matter where you are, and Phillips at CLT is no exception. But the service was good and it was nice to be in a proper sit down restaurant at an airport."}
{"text":"Large restaurant and bar- you won't get cramped in this one! Pictures all over the walls of crabs and crabbing back in the day when Phillips first opened in Ocean City, Maryland. Very cool. Located in C terminal (by C13), but easy to get to regardless of where you are going. I love the design of the Charlotte airport for that reason (and more). Bartender brought me fruit with my crabs'n'eggs, since I couldn't have the toast. Very thoughtful. Phillips makes their own version of Old Bay spice. It is similar, but i still like Old Bay better."}
{"text":"A welcome sight when I am stuck in Charlotte Airport (which is often... thanks US Air)!  The crab soup is disappointing (lack of flavor) but the crabcake sandwich and salad are excellent.  The prices are relatively high so it keeps the crowds away... a nice and delicious respite from the normal garbage served in airports.  There is a full bar and table service.  I also was put off by the plastic utensils but you take the good with the bad and the food is good."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write. Initially, I had my mind set on 2 stars. I had high expectations for the advertised lobster roll (Maine lobster, shaved lettuce, brown butter aioli, grilled roll). Well, when the dish arrived it looked kind of messy, as if they just threw the 2 rolls and fries on the plate in a hurry. The was obviously no QC on this dish as it exited the kitchen. It was not bad, it was just Ok and the pickle was missing  from the plate. However, the waffle seasoned fries were really good. And the thing that made me give this place 3 stars was my server. He was prompt and attentive and to make it even more difficult he offered and prepared to-go drinks to his customers so we did not have to spend a fortune at airport prices while we waited for our connection."}
{"text":"For a fast food place it took a little bit of time... not a lot of time, but enough that I looked at my watch both while waiting in line and while waiting for my food.  I decided to try the lobster roll with fries.  The lobster roll was quite good with big chunks of lobster that was quite flavorful and I would recommend it.  The waffle fries were okay, but kind of salty.  You probably want to have a drink handy.  I took it to go and while they put it in a bag there were no napkins (of course I didn't notice this till I went to eat it in a place no where near napkins).  I'd consider going back and I felt I got a decent meal for my money, more of a 3.5 but not a 4."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not fresh either. Lobster roll was ok but a bit too rubbery. Steamed vegetables to me, are usually soft, why can't anyone steam broccoli correctly?! Decent wasn't great but service was very good. I guess it's pretty typical for airports, overpriced and meh.."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but the Bloody Mary was definitively a disappointment to say the least..."}
{"text":"I had a mixed experience at this new eatery.  While Cream Crab Soup was hot, pureed, and excellent; and waffle-style Cajun-spiced chips were good, the fish in a Cod & Chips order consisted of only two small cod fillets that were a little mushy.  The Forum Food Court in which this food stand is situated is a slightly upscale food court with correspondingly upscale prices and a sleek, modern look; an orange, brown, and white decor; and comfortable upholstered banquettes and chairs.  Its men's restroom, however, when I was there was a complete mess, with paper towels strewn on the floor, on the edge of being out of soap and towels, and way overcrowded with a line of men but just one urinal.  The old Food Court at Caesars may have lacked a contemporary vibe, but I found it to have more charm and better, more appropriately priced cuisine."}
{"text":"Service is terrible at the table on the right side of the bar. Should have sat at the bar, people there are finished eating before we even got our food. Waitstaff gathers around computer terminal and talks while everyone's waiting for service. Have to say that that tables on the other side of the bar are receiving much better service. Food was OK."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic lobster roll and first was thrown back by the expensive price since its in a food court area but bought it anyways. The lobster roll comes with waffle fries and together it's a very filling meal. The food court is loud but it's to be expected in a food court location. The cashiers were nice and friendly and the food was good! Try the lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Just came to grab a bite to eat right before a show.   Ordered a crab cake sandwich and a lobster roll  Pros- The only spot in the food court with no line on a Friday. Crab cake was pretty good and waffle fries wee great  Cons - $30 price tag, lobster roll wasn't good at all, $30 sticker price. And last but not least....... The fact that I had to pay $30 for a meal that was just ok at best.   Conclusion - now I know why there was no line.   Tip- don't ask them for napkins. They will look at you funny and tell you they don't have none."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo expensive for the bite size portions that you receive! I've had dinner and breakfast at this restaurant before. I love the crab soup. I even buy it in Harris Teeter in the frozen section from time to time. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. For half an arm, you get the smallest, thinnest crab cake, 5 fries & fruit. While the crab cake was very good, not a lot of filler. I doubt i'd pay for it, or anything in this restaurant, without the backing of a company reimbursement again."}
{"text":"I did the dougie followed by the hustle when I saw that there was a Phillips Seafood at Caesars.  After all, I had really good experiences in Baltimore, Maryland (at the Inner Harbor) and at the Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania.  Needless to say, I was delighted.  It's not a full version of the restaurant, it's an Express, but still worthy.  A nice little food court, new since I've been here last.  Phillips is surrounded in good company: Starbucks, Smashburger, Earl of Sandwich, Di Fara Pizza, Graeter's Ice Cream (from Ohio), Tiger Wok & Ramen, and La Gloria Street Foods of Mexico.  Try them all and you'll have quite the bellyful.  When my eyes became focused on the menu overhead, like a dart, it went to the Lobster Roll.  A short wait of 10 mins seemed like a lifetime, and, there it was.  A bounty of lobster atop a buttered roll with a side of waffle chips.  The lobster roll was a good 7\" long with lots of glorious meat.  The roll could have been better, but all in all, it was great for $14.99.  While dining the food court could be anywhere in anytown USA, it's a good option for a bite without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I was in the Charlotte airport, which has really good WiFi for an airport, but I digress, and had some time so I thought I'd stop in, which I did, hence the review.  I ordered the fish and chips, stay way.  It is Tilapia and breaded to the gills (get it).  It was one piece of fish and the fries were fair.  They say the crab cakes are really good, but I have not had crabs since high school.  I will not return if I am in the airport again."}
{"text":"Plate had a hair on it, the waitress simply suggested to change out the plate. Beer had a bug in it. Nothing was done. Was very much looking to the lobster roll, especially coming off a 4.5 hour flight. Took forever to get check."}
{"text":"The Cream of Crab soup is actually quite good and keeps the rating at 3 stars but just barely.   Also got a Caesar salad that was in no way, shape or form a Caesar. OK it had some slightly limp Romaine as well as boxed croutons and some shreds of Parm but, the dressing...  First, since when does Caesar dressing come on the side?  Second, since when does it look and taste like bottled Kraft Italian!?!?  I also ordered a side of 4 fried shrimp. The menu described them as lightly hand dusted, etc but, these looked and tasted suspiciously like something the Gorton's fisherman hauled in and sold to Sea Pak.   Service was fast, friendly and efficient and also helps keep an A-OK rating intact. Overall, much too pricey for what you get quality-wise."}
