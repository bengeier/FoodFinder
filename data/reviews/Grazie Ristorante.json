{"text":"Went here for dinner before a show at Absolute Comedy. The service was excellent, the food amazing, great prices. Four of us came in when it was absolutely packed, but managed to get the last table. Put in a rushed order since we didn't have much time before the show, and it took about 30mins for our main courses (pasta) to come out. The pizza people next to us were eating looked amazing too. It came out to about $80 for 2 of us after tip - bottle of wine included. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is casual Italian cuisine. Try their beet and goat cheese salad. They also have a pastry with goat cheese that is great. They have pizza and pasta both are pretty good."}
{"text":"I was in the area last night for dinner and yelped this restaurant. When arriving there around 7:45pm the place was jammed packed. We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table of two. We ended up sharing the nato pizza and some rose pasta dish. Both dishes were good, but nothing special nor spectacular. It is extremely loud in there if you have issues with noise. Service was good. I would come back, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving Italian."}
{"text":"Grazie is a very popular and a staple of Yonge & Eglinton's diet! I often come here when I don't have anything planned for dinner, the cupboards are empty and I'm out of time. It's not the absolute best meal you will ever have but it's definitely A-OK.  It's affordable and there's something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"This place fails to disapoint in my mind. Ive been going here since i moved to Yonge and Eglington with my family when i was 7. It always feels fresh, with a very lively atmosphere (reservations required) fantastic service, and food that genuinely fails to disappoint. While the food might not match that Pizaz of other Italian restaurants and bistros in this city it still provides a wonderous adventure for these young taste buds. I have never had a sour time at Grazies, and cannot wait to take the girl here to show off the calibre of dining in my old neighborhood. From price to tip top service this is the real deal. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I quite like this place for its food. The vegetarian variety is pretty decent. Not that impressed with the wine list, though. Some good servers. And absolutely hated that they were playing Latin music in an Italian place."}
{"text":"Grazie is a great example that a good restaurant need not be expensive. Highly recommended.   Pastas are cooked perfectly al dente and the sauces are packed with flavor. Every once in a while, it's nice to go back to Grazie and have a sub-$20 entr√©e and be blown away. My favourite pasta by far is \"Penza\" which I find has a perfect balance of saltiness and spice. The wait staff are also very knowledgeable about how the pastas, so be sure to ask them for information or if they have any recommendations.  They do not take reservations, but I've gone are usually a little before or after busy times so I haven't had an issue with waiting in line.   Forget about bruschetta, pizza or the desserts (they're actually not that impressive), just go for the pastas here at Grazie."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Entre prices average $15-$20. Suitable for mostly small group like 2-4 people."}
{"text":"Oh Grazie, how I love thee! I have been going to this restaurant 2-3 times a year for 15 years now and it has never left me disappointed! The staff are friendly and engaging (especially Jack!) and the Goat-cheese appetizer is a MUST FOR EVERYONE!  I finish it off with the delicious Tiramisu Dessert and Cappuccino and my night is perfect.  Great location, great food, pricing is a steal for the quality you get. I can't say enough good things.  GRAZIE!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place. The food and service are both always superb!! A must try. We've only had one negative experience- the female server at the back of the restaurant has an attitude problem."}
{"text":"With all the hype, I expected better.  Service was great and the prices were not to bad, but the food was bland.  I expected some more POP in my garlic pasta.  I would go back if I had to, but I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Food: A Service: A- Food presentation: A Atmosphere: A Prices: B+ Recommended?:  Yes  I've been going to Grazie for the past five years or so whenever I'm craving some good pasta. As expected from any Italian restaurant, the pastas are right on the money at Grazie (of course my Italian friend disagrees). I have tried many of the pasta dishes but Odessa (smoked salmon and vodka!) and Francesca (pine nuts, raisins and basil) are by far my favourites and I highly recommend them. I also love the Bruschetta Pizza as an appetizer. The only complaint I have about Grazie is that sometimes you'll have to wait more than 20 min to get service and that might kill the initial enthusiasm, if your impatient like me. But hey, thanks to great food, the business is always booming at Grazie and even on a Tuesday afternoon this place is packed. Bottom line, if you're not italian (because you can always make better pasta at home), and craving some good pasta and have a bit of patience, then I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We found the food to be just ok. We had a pizza and a risotto. Frankly, I have had far better italian food. They seem to be charging for the ambience. I am a big fan of pizza and their pizza was mediocre. A few other italian places down the road in davisville are far better.   I dont recommend this place for a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. Everything is delicious...especially the pastas !! Watch out for long line ups because they don't do reservations...but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it's always delicious. My favourite dish is the Penza. Their pasta and the toppings are very fresh. They also have a great dessert selection. The atmosphere is nice for a date or night out with friends and the servers are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 10 years old - initially as a reward for tolerating my orthodontic treatment in which ever since my first visit has now made Grazie my go to place for good, hearty Italian food in midtown Toronto.  The decor and atmosphere reminds me of a traditional Italian restaurant you would see - simple with the intentions to make you feel at home .   We ordered:  Mussels in White wine Sauce - this was good but i guess not what Grazie is really known for so in the future I would pass on this appetizer.   Napoletana -(linguini with shrimps and clam) - this was an outstanding plate of pasta.  The linguini is fresh - you can tell from the egginess of the pasta and how the pasta at certain points vary in thickness giving you a nice chew and texture.     Assisi (Fettucini with mushroom and sundried tomatoes) - another home run. Again the pasta was fresh and excellent and the sauce dangerously addictive.  We ended up ordering an extra round of bread to mop up all the flavourful tomato sauce for both dishes in the end!   Creme Brulee Cheesecake  - I think their cakes are supplied from La Rocca and generously portioned - a good way to end the meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Yonge and Eglinton location for several years, always a treat with good service. We lived 7 minutes away and it took great will power not to go there every weekend. They have the most authentic Italian food that we could find in the city. The following are the dishes we had and are awesome:  Baked Goat Cheese Salad Caesar Salad Varese Minestrone Romana Pizza Giovan Pizza Gnocchi Odessa Capri Catrina  and the dessert you have to try: Frutti di Bosco...."}
{"text":"REALLY disappointing mushroom tart phyllo dough appetizer,only 3 slices of mushrooms for $15."}
{"text":"I disagree with most of the other reviews.  I came here for lunch.  I did not like the food at all.  The pasta was terrible.  I ordered a spaghetti dish with chicken, olive oil, and garlic for lunch.  The pasta itself was mushy and disgusting. It tasted like macerated noodles instead of boiled pasta.  Barely saw any olive oil in the pasta.  The chicken was not fresh.  It tasted like what happens when you leave leftover roasted chicken in the fridge for two days.  Similarly, the garlic itself was stale.  When one eats an entire crushed clove of garlic, one should get more than just a light garlicky flavour.  I'll grant that service was on-point and decor is good.  But the foundation of a restaurant is in its cooking.  Without a foundation in food quality, everything else doesn't count.  This place is a miss.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Grazie countless times, and they never disappointed me, not a single time, never. If you are looking for a fancy Italian gourmet dinner, this restaurant is not a place for you. But Grazie reminds you of your grandma's kitchen you'd go every once in a while when you were a kid; little, homey, and warm toned vibe.   I haven't tried menus other than their pastas, because most of pastas on their menu are amazing. My favourite pasta in the house is Assisi (Fettucine with variety of mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes), and mushrooms in the pasta are fresh every time I visit. Moreover, the waiting staffs are really honest with the choices of menu. They recommend you what they personally enjoy, even if the pasta they recommend is cheaper than the one you choose to order.   I was never dissatisfied with the service. The waiting staffs are prompt upon your request, and kindly serve you with smiles on their faces.  If you are craving for homey pasta from your grandma's kitchen, this is the right place."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Their food is great, the prices are fantastic, their staff is amazing, what more do you want?! I've been to Grazie a few times now, the most recent time was by far the best experience to date. We decided to have dinner on a Saturday night for my girlfriends birthday with a party of 12. I know they don't take reservations on Saturdays but it's my girlfriends favourite restaurant so I decided we can wait for a table on her special day. We were seated within 20-25 minutes... seriously?! For a place with not much dining space compared to other restaurants in the area, plus the fact that there's always a line up of people waiting to be seated; that just made my night. The atmosphere was nice, the food was perfect, and the wine bottles were well priced. I was raving about how great the dinner was to all my friends and co-workers. Shout out to Angelo, Jordan, and the rest of the staff at Grazie for taking such good care of us. You've made yet another life time customer, we'll be seeing you more often."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant esp. the waiter guy with a huge ass.  It makes your appetite go up the roof.  Seriously any thing you eat at this place is excellent.  Excellent  service excellent food."}
{"text":"What can I say? Worst service ever. Waited over an hr and a half for service, the guy in the front was very rude when we asked for an update , and then food took another hour, food tasted good but the overall evening left a sour taste in my mouth. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I've been coming here for years, mainly because of how convenient it is to where I live. We almost always start with the mussels and I usually have either the Tasca or Penza as my main. The food tastes good and the portions are large, but the ambiance in the restaurant isn't amazing. The tables are crammed really close together and the chairs aren't the most comfortable. Plus, there is almost always a lineup and they don't take reservations. The service is generally quite friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. The portions are quite big and most pastas I've tried were very good. The goat cheese salad is just awesome and so is the Varese salad. Very similar to the good food you can find in local restaurants of Florence.  They don't take reservations so go ahead of time. For lunch, you can usually find space. From what I remember, there was no private parking so I parked across the street but I may be wrong on this."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening. We had been in Italy in February and have to say that the food at Grazie was as good as and perhaps better than anything we had there. I had the Pesaro, rigatoni with blue cheese sauce, light blue cheese and not overpowering, with bits of asparagus. Wonderful flavor and presentation. My wife had the Tasca, filled wit spinach and Brie cheese in a tomato porcini sauce. Super dinner, great service and highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's good. With all the places you can get pasta in this neighbourhood it's my fave. I usually order the Terino. It's not over priced and the pasta is good. The pizza is good too, there are also a lot of pizza places in the neighbourhood and the pizza here is in the same league as the rest of them."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday Nite . The tables are so close together,they never used to be so close.All the staff were squessing between our table which was very annoying . The food tasted great although we were both sick the next day . We had different meals ,so go figure .The seats are uncomfortable . If u want a romantic setting ,forget it .Not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud .An honest review"}
{"text":"Celebrated a friend's birthday at Grazie, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.     Heads up: this restaurant does not do dinner reservations over the phone, you have to walk in and place your name on the list. We were told our wait time would be 20 - 25 minutes but we ended up waiting about 45 minutes. (BTW we were there on a Saturday, not sure if it's the same during weeknights)"}
{"text":"5 stars doesn't mean it's the best italian food in Toronto, nor is Grazie priced that way. My four stars are for really great food at a great price served by great people. Sit at the bar and meet the neighbourhood. The menu is solid as a rock (it's changed ever so slightly over 25 years). Penza is the favourite of most but I love the Giovanni Pizza and the Udine (with tomato sauce instead of the cream) - let the tomato sauce combine with the goats cheese for a perfect light sauce.  Where Grazie earns it's fifth star is the daily specials. look into its kitchen and if you see the ever present bandana of one of the most under-rated chefs in the city, order the special! Chantel is crushing dish after dish these days. See the Grazie Facebook site for pictures.   Ciao!"}
{"text":"Food is great as always but my whole family told them 3 times we are here to celebrate a birthday and it got ignored. A Happy Birthday would have been nice as you only get to choose 1 place for your birthday! we even opened presents as they cleared the table and....nothing!  So go there for the food but don't do any celebrations at this locations. Go to their Toronto location, much better service!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Italian food. I ordered their seafood pasta special and it was enormous. It's not jump up and down good, but can definitely satisfy a pasta craving. I also consider myself somewhat of a tiramisu expert I give their tiramisu two thumbs up. I copied them and started serving my tiramisu in little balls. Very creamy and yummy! Service is not the fastest but I am generally in no hurry so it's fine by me."}
{"text":"Pasta is very fresh and flavorful. They generally don't allow substitutions so cant rate it a 5.  Generally packed so be prepared for a wait on a Saturday's. Kids love the Caesar salad as a starter and a number of the different pasta dishes. Portions are reasonable to a bit on the large size.   Bathroom downstairs smells musty but generally clean and staff tend to be pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Grazies is very inconsistent. Sometimes you can go there, have amazing service, food and drinks and other times the staff seem like they could care less.  I can't complain about the food. The Penza with Chicken is go to Pasta dish but the Milano is not far behind. More consistent staff would get this place a 4.  Also long line ups for dinner, but wait times are short.  Lunch shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"Grazie was very good. The atmosphere is a bit loud and crowded, but the food is worth it. My friends had the Giovanni pizza (pepperoni, sausage, onion and hot pepper) and Pesaro pasta (rigatoni with asparagus and blue cheese pesto). Both really enjoyed their dishes. I had the Nonna Franca (spaghetti with broccoli, anchovy paste, pine nuts and raisins). All I can say is \"Yum!\"  The combination sounds weird, but the taste of the dish is superb. Flavourful, fresh, salty and rich. I'd definitely get it again.  The service was okay. A bit scattered at times, but friendly and unpretentious. Nothing much to complain about.  With a main and two alcoholic drinks, my bill came to about $35 without tax and tip. Not bad at all!   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. All items our small company took were perfect. However the service was mediocre: we had to wait for 20 minutes for every interaction with the waiter at the end we had to get up to ask for a check. Note that the place was less than half full, and the staff was just chatting among themselves. One more thing : it was extremely noisy, since they packed all customers into the same smaller room and did not let anyone to use the second , bigger one."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good, but the pasta dishes were salty."}
{"text":"Went last night to Grazie, for my girlfriend's birthday. We have visited many times. The restaurant is busy! It took about 40 minutes to get a table. Unfortunately they do not take reservations. The wait staff were fun, and helpful. I had the mussels in white wine sauce and the penza for my meal. The mussels are always rich and delicious. I enjoyed the penza quite a bit too. The food was hot when it came to the table. The penza was cooked perfectly al dente. It is with vodka rose sauce, pancetta, and green onions.   The meals are always fantastic and reasonably priced. The menu is full of options. I've never had their pizza because I can't go without their pasta, maybe one day I'll try it. We'll keep returning there in the future.    Please note they do not accept debit. Only cash or credit card."}
{"text":"We were looking for real Italian food and Grazie did not disappoint.  We went three times and every time it was full, we only waited a few minutes before being seated and it was well-worth it.   The atmosphere was great, staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the food...  The food was absolutely wonderful. We tried pasta, salads and dessert, each was equally delicious.  The prices were very reasonable, cheap in comparison to what we would pay for a meal of equal size in Alberta."}
{"text":"I had a Tasca, my first vegetarian like pasta. Pretty sweet, not blown away, but if I ever pass by this place, I'll try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and the food has been consistently good! nice ambiance and service was always good as well."}
{"text":"Great food nnd wine and the service and staff are amazing.   I have to travel from the West GTA to get there which can be difficult with traffice.   The chicken is my favourite, worth waiting for after Calamari on a Wednesday.   Love it."}
{"text":"The Agnolotti is to die for.  Whenever I'm at Yonge & Eglinton I'll try to stop in!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the restaurant is usually busy during the weekends.  Went there on a Friday evening and had to wait 20mins for my table. We order the following  -Basta Pasta, it's a cream sauce base with shrimp and green onions along with their homemade fettuccine is my all time favourite pasta ! I order it every time I'm there.  I can't stress enough how good their pasta is ! ( except the ravioli I had last time...Mmm..tasted frozen to me, therefore I prefer to order their fresh pasta instead from that moment on )  -Giovanni Pizza, Love how thin their pizza is and it's so crispy !!  -Had special of the day calamari, it was fresh ! nicely battered where the calamari was just nicely covered and fried, you can still taste how fresh the seafood is !  ** Their bread that they serve is always a downside for me, because it tastes bland and not fresh**  Overall i would like coming here if I want a nice plate of pasta, but if you are a person who likes big portions beware this place doesn't serve big portions of pasta."}
{"text":"Grazie is one of my favourite Italian restaurants. It's good quality, fresh ingredients and reasonbly priced. They have a ton of different pastas on the menu - i've tried about 5 diff ones now and liked them all - I'm never disappointed when I eat there. My favs include the branca salad, penza and tasca pasta.  I hear the location at Yonge & Eg always has a line-up - the Vaughan location is the same menu and i have never had to wait!"}
{"text":"First time going after hearing great reviews from friends.  Excellent pastas.  Don't expect classic italian dishes but the two dishes that I tried were wonderfully executed.  The hearty meat sauce was gloriously garlicy.  I need to go back to try other dishes.  Be prepared for linups."}
{"text":"Loved the Chianti, Catarina pasta and the Atlantic salmon!! The service was great, not sure about the name of the guy, but he had a great sense of humor. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Grazie for over 20 years - yummy eats at reasonable prices, great dessert selection and great service! I actually moved away from Toronto 12 years ago, but every year I come home to visit I make a visit to Grazie :) I love their pear salad and my fave pasta dish is the Napoletana!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and lively Italian restaurant in the Yonge and Eglinton area. The Pizzas are excellent, my personal favorite is the Margarita with Buffalo cheese.  The staff is super friendly, and to get the full experience sit at the bar, and get to know the many regular this place claims. They can tell you more about secret dishes.. hint ask about the cheese and meat peasant platter, the pears filled with blue cheese make me weak in the knees. Dessert at Grazie is also amazing, tough call between the quality tiramisu and the light chocolate cake with a shot of espresso on top.. hmm I think I have to go to Grazie again to further investigate these two"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty dishes.  Only draw back is traffic in and outbid the area it is in.   Worth it however.   Good selection of wines as well. Martin"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Grazie since it first opened years ago. The food is tasty, well-priced, simple Italian fare. The staff make you feel at home, and the restaurant always fills up with a friendly, vibrant crowd. Sit at the bar, and the bartenders will chat you up and may top up your wine just because. Great place to catch up with friends - or make new ones - over pasta and wine."}
{"text":"Great services. love their goats cheese salad and tiramisu. MUST try."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, food was amazing. Looking forward to bringing friends here next week."}
{"text":"Mediocre all around  Mediocre food and subpar service  We were a party of 20 coming in for a birthday, from the get go we were treated as though we were in convenicing them because we happened to be waiting in their narrow bar area waiting for a table to be ready  Finally when the tables freed up we were seated and told they couldnt do separate tabs but would do it by table... hmmm ok even Moxies and Jack Astors can manage separate tabs but sure lets go with it  We order a Caesar salad to start and the trapani and teramo pasta dishes.  The server brought out 2 baskets of crusty bread with one tiny saucer of oil/vinegar for a table setting 12 people. Basically one side of the table got to use the oil/vinegar and the other side went without and had to try and track the server down in order to request some for the others, which in of itself took 20 mins. The bread with rock hard, everyone was commenting how it was so crusty that it felt like it was cutting your gums and the roof of your mouth  After the server initially brought us water, it never occurred to him or the other assistants they had to replenish the water or offer refills... even though they walked by and constantly glanced at our tables10 to 15 times.  When the mains came out, again one side the the table was offered parm and black pepper and the other side was forgotten until one of us managed to flag someone down  The food itself was ok. It wasn't bad and it wasn't something to come home about. To be perfectly honest, its not anything you couldn't make at home.  When it came down to the bill I guess the server had a change of heart and decided all of a sudden he could split the tabs, except since he decided he would do this at the end he managed to have everyones tabs differently. When I asked him if he could correct the bill his words are he couldn't handle the corrections and he couldn't handle splitting it it according to what it needed to be split. No offense buddy, but when you're automatically making 18% gratuity I don't think clicking on a screen here and there is too much work. Nor do I think making sure we have water, bread, oil, vinegar should be considered too much to handle. He had about 5 other servers helping him and he or Grazie in general was acting like they were hosting a wedding reception because they were managing 2 tables.  You would think knowing getting 18% would ensure good, courteous and prompt service. But the service at Grazie was geared towards small tables were I guess for them hoping for 15% is their target. Doesn't make any sense to me and based on that and theyre mediocre food none of us will be coming back. Ciao Grazie Arrivederci!"}
{"text":"A very popular place for first time dates or couples. Their pizza is alright , they sure can do a better job with the dough and sauce and of course ingredients. Pastas taste delicious but infused with loads of butter to make it that way. Overall, a good place to come out with a parter , date etc . At times the tables are so close together and cramped up that it becomes difficult to keep a mellow conversation flowing, not the best choice if you want to get to know your guest."}
{"text":"Honestly, after I read many of the reviews, I wondered if there were two Grazie Ristorantes on Yonge Street, near Elginton and I was in the wrong one. .  I am usually pretty easy to please, so my experience was very disappointing.   The food portion was very small.  (this comment was made by my host)  But, I'm thinking this was a blessing in disguise, because the food was really sub-standard.  For $15.00, I expected more.       I  was not able to finish the meal (linguini with spinach, grilled chicken, bacon) as it was just not enjoyable.  Never in my whole life have I seen smaller pieces of chicken, cut in such short/thin pieces)  The server never asked me if the meal was satisfactory, not even when he saw most of the food left on my plate.  He either knew the answer or didn't care, likely both.      It did not live up to their rep.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, I just wasn't sure whether to rate this place 4 or 5 stars. Finally decided on 4, the reason being the attitude of the waiters. Grazie is our go-to restaurant for pizza and pasta, we come here at least once a month. Their pizzas are really good, though I am trying to limit myself with pizzas :-)  I love their steamed mussels and Pesaro pasta (this is the one with asparagus and blue cheese pesto) and I honestly think they mix the best Batisto in TO. Re sweets, I must mention a creme brulee cheesecake. This one is impossible to resist :-) Again, I would gladly give the place 5 stars (the food deserves it), but I cannot stand their waiters, you get bad attitude all the times. Last Fri when my son spilled his soup all over the table, the waiter told us \"you should watch your kids here, it's not a zoo\". My husband was so pissed off that it will take a long time before I'll be able to convince him to come there again..."}
{"text":"The decor is dated but the food was phenomenal. Pizza serving was generous for one person. Crust was amazing. Toppings were fresh.  Pasta portions were generous and tomato  sauce was flavourful. I had the Bologna pasta with a meat sauce which tastes homemade. Prices were very good for the quality and quantity of food provided.   Service was quick. Servers were polite and always ensured glasses were always filled with water.   I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure everyone who lives in the Yonge and Eglinton area has tried Grazie at least once. It's hard to miss it, sitting prominently along Yonge Street in a heavily trafficked and well-lit area. I read somewhere that it was Mats Sundin's favourite restaurant in the city.  I can't count the number of business lunches and date nights I've had at this place. It's usually the first thing that comes to mind when I'm reluctant to experiment with a new establishment in the neighbourhood. When I'm hungry and looking to be satisfied, I usually go to Grazie because I know what to expect.   The restaurant is consistent in terms of food quality. Don't get me wrong, I've had some bad experiences with my selections in the past (mainly with appetizers). Also, on most occasions their bread seems like it's been out for awhile and you need a razor sharp knife to cut through it. Their pastas and pizzas are a decent portion. I ordered from their 'Secondi Piatti' menu a few times; I tried the Veal Striploin. It was not outstanding, especially not for the price. I would stick to the pastas. My favourite is the Penza (Rigatoni with vodka, pancetta (cured bacon), green onions & a touch of chili pepper) for $15.  The service is hit or miss. The last time I was there, they put us in a cramped area where you had to squeeze your butt against someone's back to get to your table. The waitress was very polite and courteous, but seemed to forget about us as soon as the evening rush came in. That wasn't the first time it's happened. The first time was a lot worse, where the waiter didn't even come back to our table to ask us about our food, didn't refill our glasses, and had to be hunted down to get the bill. The busboys are cool.  If you're looking for a solid place that won't absolutely break the bank, go to Grazie."}
{"text":"A friend and I dropped by since we were in the Yonge-Eglinton area. My friend really wanted to try this place because she heard good reviews.   I ordered the Udine while my friend ordered the Amalia. My dish was very good. I enjoyed the combination of the creamy sauce with the bell peppers and mushrooms. As per my friend's pasta dish, she recommends to hold off on the parmasean cheese that is sprinkled on by the waiter. She thought it was too cheesy.  Waiter was very attentive to our needs. I'm very impressed.  Overall, great pasta. The atmosphere was welcoming but it was loud. I kept saying, \"WHAT?\" \"Say again?\". And I don't have hearing problems..."}
{"text":"We have been to the other Grazie location in Vaughan as well, but prefer the Yonge St location best. The pizzas and pastas are excellent, however I would not say they compare to authentic Italian restaurants. Salads are mediocre. The atmosphere is nice, there seems to be long line-ups on weekends for dinner. This is our restaurant of choice, but only if we are in the area. We had the Nico pasta a couple of nights ago and this has to be the best pasta dish we have had here."}
{"text":"Staff and service were wonderful. They accommodated our large group. Food was excellent and portions were large. My son said it was the best Ceasar salad he ever had. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it was a little noisy."}
{"text":"I always walk by Grazie and blatantly look into the huge glass walls and get jealous of the people eating there. I remember my first time there - it was like going on a first date with a ok-looking guy who had such a great personality i walked away smiling and giggling to myself.   Grazie definitely wowed me. The atmosphere is great, pasta is fresh, prices are very reasonable, and the waiters are helpful. I had the special of the day which was a seafood linguine, and OMG, i got SO MUCH SEAFOOD: mussels around the plate,  one whole (yes, the whole) calamari, a bunch of shrimps, salmon and scallops. the pasta was so fresh and the dish was so hot - i literally gobbled down the whole thing just to realize afterwards that i ate way too much.   one downside: they serve wine in short crappy glasses that are normally used to serve well drinks like vodka tonic. that is my biggest  pet-peeve. but that aside, everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"So I thought I would give this place another chance given all the other great reviews from others.  I have to say, the pasta here is nothing special -akin to what you might get at a Pickle Barrel.  Our waiter was annoying, and kept trying to impress us with his fake Italian pronunciation of the entrees.  I really don't understand why people keep raving about this place.  There is way better Italian food elsewhere in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Too expensive. Sip wine bar next door has same quality of food for half the price. For a third of the price you can go to Mars Diner for filling comfort food. This restaurant takes itself too seriously for the food quality."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Italian place to eat. Great for a Friday night out with the family! They are known for their thin crust pizzas and deliciously made pastas. Atmosphere is always lively and the complimentary sourdough bread is amazing! Been going here with the family for 3 years now!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Italian restaurant!! Love the food, the atmosphere and location!! I have dined here couple of times and each time the food has been consistent and delicious!! Everything on their menu..from appetizers to entree to their mouthwatering dessert menu is just great!! They offer great wines that compliments their food very well! The wait staff is very warm and provide great service!! Only thing is they get super busy around dinner time especially during weekends, so be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is always packed! Another trap in the Yonge and Eglinton area.  It is definitely overrated!  If you have any cooking ability, you could probably make something better at home."}
{"text":"The food at this place is absolutely superb! The food is reasonably priced but the chefs pick of the day is a little expensive but it's really good!!"}
{"text":"Love the burrata cheese salad. Pizza's are excellent. Always enjoy the atmosphere, food and service. Have been 5+ times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! This place knows Italian! The food is great and the servers are very accommodating if you need to make a change. The place is usually packed and they don't take reservations but if you don't mind waiting 10-15 minutes they will get you seated as soon as they can. If you are looking for an authentic Italian experience go eat here!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious...but this is the 2nd time I've gotten food poisoning at this restaurant.  I had a cream based pasta and I'm sure it was the cream.  I was extremely sick...  When I got sick last time, I can't remember what I had.  I will NOT go to this restaurant again, regardless of how the food tasted.  Sad.  Epic fail on their part."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Italian this place is amazing. They are usually jam packed around dinner hours so I'd call in a reservation to be sure to get a table. The quality of the pasta is amazing, they have interesting dishes and the salads are different than the typical italian place. Their soups are also amazing and very filling. The service is so friendly and they are really attentive which is great so you never have to flag them down!"}
{"text":"Have passed by Grazie a million times, and was never interested in going inside.  My neighbour recommended that I give it a try, so I did.  The lovely interior does not match the exterior, and I am glad that I gave it a try.  We ordered a lovely Malbec to share, while we enjoyed the complimentary bread which was delicious! To dip they provided both the oil & vinegar as well as a spicy oil mixed with Parmesan cheese.   I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered the soup of the day which was kale with Italian sausage.  It was just the right amount of spice.  For dessert we shared the Tiramisu which is definitely a share plate as it is quite a lot.  It was nice and light and was a nice end to a delicious dinner.  I plan to go back to try the pizza and some pasta."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile now!  i went on a Tuesday around 5ish pm, thank goodness i did! Because when i was done my meal the restaurant was starting to get packed  Decor is very nice, this is one of the only places that had a nice basement washroom.  Server was amazing! He recommended the good stuff and surprised us, the bartender mixed up a drink for me. Delish  The server would go outside and refill customer's dog water.  NOW ONTO THE FOOD!  I ordered the Basta, that was alright. It was good but i have yet to find a cream sauce that has blown my mind.  My boyfriend got the \"Paesana-Fettucini with Italian sausage & fresh peppers\"  It was amazing, next time i go i will probably get a tomato sauce or rose sauce based pasta!  Their brushetta was somewhat a disappointment and it came after we were done our pasta (it was the appetizer) The bread was rock hard.  The bread at the table isn't fresh, just regular bread.  Overall food 4.5/5 Service 4/5 Price 4/5  I will definitely come again and try the Vaughan location as well! Apparently this location is the original."}
{"text":"definitely make reservations  food was 4 stars service 3  overally 3.5/5! Not bad, not amazing, I prefer the originally Grazie in uptown toronto, it just tastes more fresh and much more attentive service. Here they just have a bunch of teenage boys"}
{"text":"Delicious pasta! Their cream tomato sauce is ridiculously good! I could eat the Torino pasta every day. However, I definitely prefer ordering out from here since it is very very busy inside and quite loud. Especially during weekend dinner time. Although I would say that this is a great Italian restaurant at Yonge & Eglinton, it is certainly is not the only. There are quite a few quieter places that have excellent food too!"}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest. We came in starving and had to wait 30 minutes for our food. We ordered two different pasta dishes and I was thrown off by the texture of mine. I forgot what it was called but it was like one giant ravioli stuffed with mush. It felt heavy and greasy. However we did enjoy our wine and ultimately left on a good note. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here. We come quite often and sit at the bar for dinner.  The food is consistently good and always comes out hot.  Great service and friendly atmosphere.  It's our go to Italian spot in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Food consistently good for last 13 years since coming here. Seafood pasta is so yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been going here with my family for years.  The food is consistent and delicious.  I'm always a little surprised by the long line-up for a table, because it is good, but is it *that* good?  But yes, I guess it really is!   I've almost always had their pasta, and I've tried many different variations (Torino, Paesana, Tortelini, Bianca, etc.) and loved them all.   On our most recent visit, we all indulged in dessert (we don't always), and the creme brulee cheesecake was the biggest hit around the table.    The atmosphere is very casual and comfortable.  The service is great (although they will likely move you through fairly quickly if the line-up is still long).  Grazie is sort of like a staple and a tradition in the city, and I will continue to be a loyal patron!"}
{"text":"I rarely trek out of my Downtown comfort circle for food experiences so Grazie must be a worthwhile restaurant for me to have made more than one trip. My friend raved and raved about this place for months before I set foot in it the first time that I think by then, I was already conditioned to drool at the thought of Grazie like Pavlov's dog.  The few times I've been, I did not have to wait long because it was always a party of 2 or 3 and my friend would be there before me waiting at the bar. I think I've always gone for earlier dinners though, which might be helpful. The store seats a lot of guests and is nicely lit and clean. The menu is extensive and well-organized: pasta by sauce. Service is attentive and kitchen is fast - the \"How to\" of an excellent restaurant business.  I have not tried their other entrees so I can only comment on their pastas, which I dearly approve of. The pasta is always cooked to perfection, sauce is always different. I am usually a fan for cream sauce but have also tried their tomato sauce items... I'm a fan of the Basta and for those that really like hearty comforting meals, the Bologna is distinct. I have to go back and try more and become the Grazie master!!  Atmosphere - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"One of the best places to have pasta in Toronto. Very filling portions, not greasy, excellent quality of ingredients and good wine at reasonable prices. Service is exceptional. However, we didn't really enjoy the desserts. They aren't as necessary due to the big portions of the main dishes and appetizers/salads."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I had very little expectations when I went to Grazie Ristorante. Italian restaurant located near Yonge & Eglinton? Not quite an ideal scenario, I thought. I was practically dragged by a friend but I am happy he insisted.   The menu was pretty large and usually that does not equal to good food but as I was already there, I would as well adventure myself and try it out.   They could not sit us before the entire party's arrival but I went to their bar and had a glass of wine. Rules are rules and I have to give that they were busy especially for a Monday evening. I have to say that the host was somewhat obnoxious and our waiter was very, very casual.   My dish on the other hand was very good. I had Tasca. A pasta dish filled with spinach and ricotta, mushroom, and brie cheese. Very light and tasty! My friends were very happy with their dishes. They had the Basta (spinach linguini with shrimp), and Nico (pappardelle with veal in a creamy sauce).   I am not dreaming about my next visit to Grazie but if I am in the neighborhood, I would not mind coming back."}
{"text":"Will never go to this location after talking to the owner on the phone. Was asking for a reservation for a large group for dinner. I knew they didn't take reservations on the weekend but wanted to see if they would make an exception since we were a large group and it was a milestone birthday (knew the chances were slim). Instead what I was told was how large groups aren't of value to them as they don't make as much money and that they are in the business of flipping tables and doing volume so don't care about groups and don't even want groups! This was said to a customer!!?!! Any owner that basically says to their customer that they aren't as valuable as they  are only focused on making as much money as possible makes me seriously question how they run the rest of their business. Perhaps the owner forgot that the key to have the large group as repeat business is to give fantastic customer service. So if you don't want to support a business that treats their customers like they are just numbers, then join me in boycotting this establishment. Luckily their competition right in the same plaza was happy to take our business and equally appalled at how we were treated:)"}
{"text":"This is a new low, my boyfriend just held my hair back so I can lick the take-out plate...... I love Grazie, the only problem is they are always busy, so you wait for 40 minutes for either a table or delivery."}
{"text":"My roommate highly recommended Grazie and brought me and my bf to this place. The food was not bad, but it was not amazing either (even my roommate agreed this time).  It was not expensive but still  I expected something better than what we had. I think perhaps what we ordered wasn't their specialty dishes? Not sure. I would give this place another try though."}
{"text":"Good food,  good location and good prices. Very nice place to sit . Very food service and staff. The chef here are very good and food was prepared very well. Would recommended to friends and wil eat hear again in the future."}
{"text":"I ate here on Monday for lunch with a couple of people from work. After staring at the menu for far too long, there are a lot of options, I eventually decided to go with what my colleagues had recommended so I asked for the gnocchi with ricotta. My colleagues order a myriad of other delectable which looked equally as good as mine. I cannot remember what everyone had but I know the pizza that was ordered looked quite good, while the portions were just right for lunch. The staff were attentive but not overly so and we were able to complete our meals, enjoy conversation and listen to the light piano music without very much interruption at all. My colleagues assured me that they had been to the restaurant a lot and had not had one bad experience. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Know italian food like the back of my hand. Liked the food here but its certainly over priced and over hyped. We got a pizza and gnocchi dish. Portion sizes are barely enough and the gnocchi was swimming in sauce which i did not appreciate. They would not make substitutions on the pizza even though hubby told them he didn't like goat cheese. Didn't care for the customer service at all. Especially coz the waiter behaved like he was a superior being for some reason. The place is always full, likely because of the hype, but i've had better italian food without the pretentious snobbery. Overall a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"can't say I'm the biggest fan of Grazie's decor but the ambience is warm and inviting, and the pasta is pretty incredible"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on Sunday night.  They had 6 tables open. So we got sat right away! We waited 15 minutes before our server came by. She seemed flustered, I understand she was weeded. She mumbled the feature so quickly I wasn't sure if she was speaking English. We ordered 2 pops. She came back 5 minutes later saying the bar was backed up, so she brought us half a glass of water. Weird... Food was great as always."}
{"text":"Food was great! Pasta's are super fresh. However we waited for an hour. But I guess that's a compliment to them that they are so busy.   I just have no patience and don't like waiting.  I also don't think they take reservations. That's what one of our friends told us.   Great place to have in Vaughan and you feel like your in Italy. I really like the authentic glasses we had our wine in.   I do recommend if you go mid week rather than weekend."}
{"text":"Taste and look of the Pizza- 3/10 Restaurant Environment-  10/10 Wait Staff - 5/10 Host Service- 10/0  Would I go back again?  NO    I wanted to go somewhere to have a nice Italian pizza, and not only being Italian I love my pizza. seeing as Grazie is an Italian restaurant which serves pizza I thought I hit the jackpot.   I walked into Grazie which was packed and full of life, I thought I had made a right decision here. I ordered my pizza \"the Giovanni\" and a glass of red.   My pizza comes and at first sight I was disappointed, it looked like it came out of a McCains pizza box, it WAS NOT thin crust nor did it taste any special. It was just an average pizza AT BEST. I wouldn't go there for pizza again."}
{"text":"Big Win.  Brought my kids, the pizza was great. Pasta, 3 different styles, all tasted fresh and vibrant. Service was above par. Great atmosphere. Loved it, will be back."}
{"text":"This place was BEYOND disappointing.  Brought family from Rome there (only because closely and superior Marcello's had an obscene line up) thought it would be good. Guy greeting us told us a table would be ready and asked us to move to the back of the restaurant while we wait. It was only after about 10 mins when I walked up to the front to see what was happening with the table we were told 'I'm waiting for people to finish their dessert and then you'll have your table'  A quick look around and I noticed NO ONE was eating dessert.  We decided to leave and all six of us walked by him and he didn't say a word.  Really professional.  Now I know why I only go to Marcello's.  Loud music and lousy service? no thank you."}
{"text":"It should be a 4 star if not the very very salty pasta.  The Capri comes with scallop  and shrimp which mixed with the linguini tastes good but with the sodium  that is overly applied makes the dish very salty.  I tried to finish it but at the end has to add some water to the dish to dilute the salt concentration.  The Giuseppe pizza is exceptionally good.  Though it doesn't  have any wood stove flavour, the pizza toppings and the soft crust make my day.  The restaurant  is pretty noisy.   The waiters are very nice."}
{"text":"Just awesome! Food was amazing and the service was great! I've had the varese salad,bruschetta,bologna and the quattro stagioni and they were all awesome!!! Can't wait to go again and try something else..."}
{"text":"Food and service and prices were all great. They don't take reservations though, so we had to wait about 45 mins for a table... But it was worth it."}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago.  Had the Tasca pasta.  Excellent!  5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"FOOD: top notch. I like that they are creative with their pasta dishes and offer a choice of four sauces accompanying different types of pasta.    I like tomato sauce so I ordered the Nonna Franca - spaghetti with sauteed broccoli, anchovy paste, pine nuts & raisins covered with bread crumbs & sesame seeds. It was delicious and very different.  Never thought of adding raisins to my pasta, but the sweetness and texture blended surprisingly well with the sourness of the sauce and the pasta.  My bf ordered the Catrina - spinach linguini with grilled chicken, pancetta, onions and black peppercorns in extra virgin oil and garlic sauce.  Also very good, with a subtle taste.   The portions were on a smaller scale, which is great for us, as we got to finish the entire plate. For those who are used to N.A. sized portions, you may want to get an appetizer as well.  SERVICE: really liked the hosts, bartender and the ones who brought water and cleared our dishes.  Funny thing is, our waiter was probably the least helpful. He  took our order and we never saw him again until he brought us the bill.  I wish that our tip went to the others (incl. kitchen staff) instead of him. But, that is just one person from the number of people that serviced us, so overall, we were still content with the level of service.  AMBIANCE: casual, lively atmosphere. There's constant background noise of people in nearby tables chatting. Seemed like everyone by the bar was having a great time. I like that it's bright in the restaurant, enabling me to see my food.  VALUE: I was surprised by the prices.  I always thought Grazie's was an expensive restaurant, since it was so popular and located at Yonge & Eglinton, but it's actually very reasonably priced, most dishes are around $15 and was tastier than some of the high end restaurants.  I definitely want to come back and try all their pastas.  I wish they take reservations so that I don't have to wait 30-60mins for a table!"}
{"text":"My far my favorite Italian restaurant! I ALWAYS get the Baked Goat Cheese Salad & Penza, my girlfriends always order the Torino. I've been to so many Italian restaurants yet it never compares to Grazie. The environment is cozy-casual, service at this location is much better than at the Woodbridge location. Two thumbs-up with no hesitations :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious meal here and great service. It is a little pricier but it is authentic Italian food and definitely makes the meal worth its price. I really recommend their mushroom and arugula pizza and their oil pastas. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype! The service was mediocre, at best; we had to ask for pepper and water refills! The food was disgusting- calamari special was too salty. We sent it back and it was still salty! My partner ordered a pasta dish in a tomato sauce and it wS so oily, and salty. Food was so gross! Would never go there again! :("}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant at yonge and eglinton strip must try. Grazie mammie mia."}
{"text":"If you love your pasta dishes this is THE place. The Penza is amazing. The only problem is selecting one pasta when there are so many amazing dishes!! The quality of the ingredients in the apps is top notch."}
{"text":"We live in the area, and there is always a huge line (and no reservations on weekends).  We tried it recently, I had the seafood pasta special, and my husband had the paella special.  Great server.  My meal was very good, a huge portion of seafood, and his was \"okay\".  It was certainly enjoyable, but I don't understand the huge waits. If you live in the area, it is worth trying, but I wouldn't travel across the city for it, it is a pretty standard Italian restaurant for Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been to grazie a few times and it is always great. The portions and prices are great value . It is well managed and the servers are very friendly. Keep up the great work grazie!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food is meh. They make a decent Caesar salad, dressing is homemade which is a plus, you can taste the anchovy and garlic, how a real Caesar should taste. The pasta was very boring and lacked flavor (I had the Penza.) When you can make better sauce at home then you know this place isn't worth going back to."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite italian eatery in the GTA  Obviously when you're here you must try their pasta - I always get the Catrina. You really can't go wrong with grilled chicken on spinach linguine and topped woth spicy pancetta and black peppercorns.  Dessert is a must as well, but you'll be hardpressed to choose between the torte and tiramisu (get both!)."}
{"text":"This place suffers from \"omg u have 2 go here its sooo good\" syndrome by people who've only eaten italian from East Side Mario's.  Homemade pasta? sounds great! Did it taste great? No, it didn't. Whatever.  Big pile of MEH."}
{"text":"Love the pasta here, especially the gnocchi. Lively environment, although a little crowded at times depending on where your sitting."}
{"text":"Many special styles of pasta.  Very good texture.  Noisy, long waiting time and the tables are too close together.  Doesn't seem very attractive from outside. But very worth going."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Italian restaurant for over 10 years. It is a classic restaurant in Toronto, known for its excellant quality italian food, good selection of wines, and dessert.   My usuals are the Penza Pasta, a fabulous caesar salad and a nice glass of wine. On some occasions, the service has been less then stellar, but on a whole a consistant and good experience"}
{"text":"The salads are fresh and crisp. The pasta is ok. The pizza's are very, very good. The service is not at all good. I asked for a house red and was told they don't do house wines. I noticed after I made my order that they had feature wines on a notice board, but I wasn't told about any. Several other tables were served before ours and the service was cool and indifferent. The food is good but I won't bring anyone I'm trying to impress to this location. It just didn't feel special."}
{"text":"i love this place the staff are great and friendly I orderd the ravioli in cremy tomato sauce and it was sooo good  the price was resnable all togeter good experience  will visit again for sure Nitza"}
{"text":"They have lots of selection. Good value.  Not the best Italian... But decent given the price and selection"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Food is cheap and delicious. Best Penza ever!!!! Wish they did reservation cause it sucks waiting 1 hr for a table. There bread with the dipping olive oil and the spices they add is soooo yummy. Keep up the good food but plz consider reservations. It's hard to wait for 1 hrs with a 13 month old"}
{"text":"I've come to Grazie 3x and my experience has always been amazing. You are greeted and welcomed as soon as you walk in the door. I brought my mom here for early dinner. Serving was very big - I got the meat sauce pasta...so DELICIOUS! Staff are very friendly and would highly recommend this place! Pizza is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Although I have lived in the neighborhood for two months now, tonight was the first night I actually ventured into Grazie. I have to say, it was a very nice experience. We had pasta and both dishes were delicious. It was very reasonably priced and I'll come back again. Just a little loud and busy to give it a better rating"}
{"text":"Really good food. Good bread. Good pizza. We ordered nico and prenzana. Amazing.especially the prenzana."}
{"text":"I hate waiting for a table but I make an exception for this restaurant.  The staff are so welcoming and extremely attentive.  Example: We requested our bread warmed up and were shocked to see them remember this when we got a second basket for the table. Amazing dinner once again and thankful for the great service! Highly highly recommended.  No wonder people line up!! Love this place :)"}
{"text":"Bianca pasta is amazing! Really good! Food service was really great,      this review is very annoying and is saying it has to be longer.... How annoying"}
{"text":"I thought I didn't need to make a reservation on a thursday night, and I was wrong, this place is packed! Our group of five were seated in around 15 minutes. The hostess was very attentive but didn't give us a table until our fifth person arrived.  Our waitress was very brief but not in a rude way. I understand they're very busy so dismissed what I otherwise would deem rude. I ordered the pasta of the day, seafood linguini. I just had to order after seeing it brought out of the kitchen for the table next to us. It looked amazing! So, three out of five of us ended up ordering just that.   The food arrived and I must say the pasta tasted as good as it looked. I was not disappointed! There was so much seafood piled on the plate and the pasta was cooked just to the nice chewy texture I love. My friend who ordered the same thing complained that her fish wasn't cooked in the middle, and advised out waitress. She got a bit defensive and said it was how white fish looked like when cooked. My friend said its not suppose to taste stringy in the middle, so the waitress told her to put the fish on the side plate and took it back to be cooked for a longer period of time. I deducted a star for the waitress' attitude.   The restaurant was very noisy. I had to practically yell across the table to be heard , and mind you, it was not a very big table. All the tables here were small. I would definitely return for their phenomenal pasta though! I'd give them 5/5 for food!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is almost identical to the one at Yonge/Eglinton except that the service here isn't as warm as I remembered.   We ordered the Parma Foccacia as the starter, and heed my warning - don't overstuff yourself with the rock-hard complimentary bread they give you, save room for the foccacia, it's super fluffy and I would probably eat one whole as an entree..   I always order the Seafood Linguine special ($28) - it's one of the most priciest pastas on their menu but so worth it. The portions are so enormous (more so at Yonge/Eglinton) I have to pack half up for lunch the next day. This dish is loaded with mussels, decent sized shrimp, fish and cuttlefish. You certainly get the bang for the buck!   This Vaughan location isn't as packed as the midtown location, and it has plenty of parking available! I'm not too picky about the poor service here because of this convenience factor - at least the food is just as good!"}
{"text":"I am not a prolific reviewer, in fact, I rarely do so. However, the SECOND of two bad experiences really motivated me to do so due to the sheer arrogance of nonetheless - the owner! Yes - the owner!!  First Negative Experience: Went on a Sunday with my wife and two children, ordered some calamari apps, so-so, oil was heavy and evidently overdue for changing. Salmon steak for the wife, grilled, potato dumpling pasta (gnocchi) for the kids with and roasted chicken with rapini.  EXPLICITLY stated what was for the kids and the adults, ordered non spicy iterations.  Kids pasta came, was to be plain tomato sauce, was very spicy, kids clamored for their drinks, wife and I tasted, way too spicy for a \"NON\" spicy request. Now the rapini... needless to say, the kids were peeing for quite some time that afternoon! Hot as he_ _!  Lets move  to the Salmon, she was so looking forward to it, nice olive caper tomato salsa. First fork in, not bad! Second fork in toward center RAW!!!! OMG! Throw down that fork! The server was an older gentleman, very customer focused, experienced for sure,  great with kids and adult patrons alike, saw the displeasure, and in fact at first look, without a word saw exactly what the problem was. We're NOT the type to make a scene, would have been content to slink out of there to the KEG across the street, take care of the bill and go. But the server insisted he call the owner over (the shorter haired, shorter stature, Breitling wearing, non justified aire about him one). I was very empathetic (being a business owner myself) and explained the issues with the kids  pasta and veggies for the children were way too spicy for their delicate palates (ours too I might add - we're Italian and EAT SPICY), and the salmon was raw at the center - and was evident as agreed the server. No so say he! We cook it  \"medium\".  My wife and I look at each other in disbelief. Now folks, I EAT MEDIUM, wife does not but I DO, I EAT SUSHI, I am no food critic, but I know what is Medium and know what rare and blue are, this was RAW. Pasta? Well, he said he tried it in the back and it was just fine! Ugh! WHAAAAT? Fine? The kids may have gotten a \"fleck\" of pepper says he. Honestly, we felt like we were on Candid Camera, Twilight zone or something akin to that. Simply aghast at the arrogance. Oooookayyyyy! Fine he took the salmon off the bill, offered dessert for the kids, we refused out of fear of something, not sure what, but something!  Went today, a business meeting for lunch, not sure why, but in the area, what the hey, lets give it another try?  I seee him.... that frown on his face, roving the corridors, there he is, that squint, that, that , that breitling and air! Ok, ok, I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine. I order food, I am happy, I pay. Hey, I am not happy, I pay anyway (not a bad deal eh).  I have a few of my own breitlings! Don't need free food, can buy your place too if you need a hand!  I digress... ok, ok lets try this again, just give me a plain garden salad with dressing on the side and the, dare I say it, Grilled Salmon! Oh my God, I said it!  Lets unfurl the napking containing the cutlery. Awww man?! Food encrusted, baked on, last lady's food on them?! Fffff, are we playing this game again?! Did they see me coming?! I just want lunch, clean, good, I eat, I pay I leave, no events!  Ok, yournger server, scruffy beard, unkempt looking jean wearing dude, seems nice enoug, takes after the head honcho it seems, gives me a new roll! Ok, lets open pandoras \"roll\". Hooray, clean, clean I say!  Here's the salad. Mix green with frisee, pour a little dressing, a few pieces browner and oxidized than they should be, what the hey, roughage is good. Bringing this frisee up to the hatch, and SSSSTOP!! Stem is black, stem is dirty, come on, they didn't wash it?!  Check the other, same condition. Awww man?! Ok, throw that fork down. Done with Salad.  Another server comes, picks plate and says: \" Why you no finish?\" I say, a little dirty, no problem. He asks if I wanted him to say anything, I say no, no, I'm fine, no problem, need to focus on this meeting here.  Salmon comes, hey it is cooked! Actually it was just ok, not great, but if I were to measure it based upon previous experiences, ya sure, great for Grazie. Salsa needs work, arugula, well,  lets just leave the ton of dirty arugula alone. It was ok,  it gave me protein to make it home alive for a home cooked real meal. I'll take fine.  OMG! There he is. Clint \"grazie\" Eastwood comes my way. Sh --t, I told that guy I don't want to make a fuss. Leans on the table, the slat eyed look and says: \"I hear you had an issue with the salad. I said indeed I did, it was DIRTY, I would call that an issue.  Folks, I cant make this shit up! Believe me, there is no agenda, this guy tells me it was the dressing, and it was clean! I PUT THE DRESSING, 20% of what they gave! If any of the brothers read this, HOUSTON you have a PROBLEM! THIS IS NOT HIS CALLING!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whenever my parents visit me to Toronto, this is where they ask to go.  The fresh pasta and pizza are hard to beat, and the service is friendly.  The bruschetta pizza as an appetizer is definitely worth a try.  It's also one of the few restaurants where I enjoy the rose sauce as it is not too heavy and is just delectable."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  Always super fresh and made to order.  Very tasty, and the menu has variety.  Knocked off a star because it's overpriced for a casual dining place. And because our waiter gives us looks when we don't order wine :)  I'd eat here every week if they knocked a few dollars off the menu items."}
{"text":"I've been to the Yonge and Eg location as well as this one.  Love both, prefer this one simply cause I can actually get a table upon walking in without waiting.  The food is excellent.  Always super fresh and made to order.  Very tasty, and the menu has variety.  Knocked off a star because it's overpriced for a casual dining place. And because our waiter gives us looks when we don't order wine :) They balk at menu changes but if you smile, they'll do it for you.  I'd eat here every week if they knocked a few dollars off the menu items."}
{"text":"Was looking for a homely pasta place and I think I found my go to place with Grazie.  All the dishes I've tried are made with love. I also really enjoyed the experience. The warm exuberant waiters make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Toronto's best restaurant for date night, family dinner night or alone in the bar and dine. They have the friendliest and amazing staff. You will not be disappointed. Try everything in the menu."}
{"text":"Been here more than a dozen times, its one if our go-to places for occasions. I've never had a less than excellent experience here. Prices are fair, food is great, servers are sincere and helpful."}
{"text":"They don't take reservation. We were there waiting for an hour to be seated, but really, the food is worthy to wait this long. The seating space is a bit crowded that my chair was attached with another table's chair, so i wasn't feel comfortable. They have a wide range of pasta on their menu, but I only have one stomach, I will definitely return to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"The salad is delicious (pear and proscuitto), and the pasta is filling. I liked it and the service is excellent.  I wouldn't say it's THE BEST Italian food in the world, but it's certainly better than what you can get in most generic Italian restaurants.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times over the years and can easily say Grazie is a great go-to pasta spot in mid-town Toronto.  There's something for everyone, the food is always consistently fresh and flavourful.  The pasta comes in such a wide range of sauces, meats, veggies, etc.  Everything I have tried has been enjoyed to the very last bite.    I will say, on a side note- that the bread could be fresher and butter comes in the little plastic containers (which cheapen the experience in my opinion) other than that though I would say it is a staple in the Yonge & Eg area."}
{"text":"I came to Grazie for lunch on Monday, the staff was friendly, the food was good, the place looks like need some fix. We sat next to a wall and at least 3 bugs walked on the wall while we were getting lunch, one of them actually ended up on the table and I am pretty sure the waitress realized it, I just stopped eating. This is disgusting."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant because I had heard great things about the pizza, and they certainly did not disappoint. There is an atmosphere that makes it inviting for family and friends.   HOWEVER, the reason I can only give this place a maximum two stars is because I had an uncomfortable encounter with a girl who gave me my food at this establishment. I don't know her name but she was of a short height and a pretty butch looking girl. She had red tinted hair. Her demeanour was what shocked me; she was SO impolite and aggressive to her fellow staff. I witnessed her yelling crude insensitive comments to her coworkers, which made me feel incredibly sorry for them. I couldn't believe the way she treated them and this made me want to get up and leave. When I had asked friends of mine who'd been here before, they also said they remembered a rude female employee with the same type of description   My advice is, Grazie Ristorante has great food and a cool atmosphere. However this specific employee  should be immediately terminated before she makes more customers feel uncomfortable through hearing her rude remarks to her own staff..."}
{"text":"I got the penza.   I went on a weekday during the middle of the day. The servers were unusually nice and made conversation with me, which I enjoy doing with others as I worked in the drive thru of a fast food restaurant during high school and university.  Food was delicious, I really liked the dip they had for the bread in the beginning and their Penza was as good as the way my other favourite places make it.  A good place for families and dates, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had the white wine mussels for appetizers and it was really well done. Cooked to perfection and enough flavour. I had the stuffed pasta the inside was a bit bland but the sauce was very delicious. We had a chocolate banana cake for dessert and that was very unique and delicious. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Have come here a few times. This is a neighbourhood resto. Wouldn't travel for this one. They don't screw up easily. Everything is decent. Never understood the lineups here esp when there are tons of other options, but I guess the consistency, family-friendly environment and the price point are pull factors.  Service, food, ambience: 3/5 Value: 3.5/5 Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Second trip to Grazie. Got the Penza (again!), baked goat cheese phyllo pastry and the Milano.  The Penza is hands down delicious! Creamy vodka and tomato sauce, Smokey pancetta, green onions, pasta al dente just ties it all together. It doesn't feel heavy for a creamy dish. Love it!  The phyllo baked goat cheese salad was a beauty! It was baked inside a phy?lo pastry dough - flaky, with warm goat cheese, mushrooms and pepper. It comes with side salad of urugula, tomatoes, olives and pesto that helps to cut the dense cheese.   Milano..was ok.   Service is friendly, fast and attentive. 4.5 overall rating!"}
{"text":"Grazie has mass appeal. The flavours are simple, predictable, and fresh. It's huge inside, child friendly and just bustling with activity.   I came here with a group of girls last night and despite the fact it was a Wednesday, starting around 6:15 there was a 15-30 minute wait for a table (always a good sign).   The complimentary bread they offer to start was okay, but not particularly fresh. It is served with individual packets of butter rather than butter fresh from the kitchen.  We ordered a simple salad to start. All the leaves were fresh and crisp and the balsamic and oil dressing was just fine.   The pasta dish I ordered had a tomato cream sauce that was okay, though lacked any real flavour, a picky eaters heaven.  A friend ordered the pizza, which is easily big enough to split. It's not quite thin crusted pizza but it certainly isn't thick either. Again, keep those picky eaters happy.  Although Grazie wasn't anything special in terms of food or atmosphere, I get it, this place has chain restaurant potential written all over it, just perfect for the families and picky eaters of the world.  As for the rest of you, try La Vecchia. It's a much better Italian joint just down the street. Grazie is overrated. Big time."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch, the pasta was pretty good."}
{"text":"Sila salad - this seafood salad is soooo sour (too much lemon and vinagrette) and has too much black pepper.  You really can't taste much else.  The celery is quite strong so the menu description \"over a bed of lettuce\" doesn't line up with what's served.  Margherita pizza - It looked like a Domino's cheese (burnt shredded mozzarella) pizza instead of the soft, white mozzarella you'd expect."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times since I live in the area and there is almost always a line up after 6pm. The atmosphere and cuisine are very authentic Italian and my favorite thing on the menu is their homemade tiramisu, which some may not find aesthetically pleasing but daaaaaaayuuum it is pleasing to my taste buds. :)  There is always a line outside around 6-7pm so I would recommend coming early or late."}
{"text":"Grazie receives a lot of praise, and I'm not ENTIRELY sure it's deserved.  We showed up at 6pm on a Saturday, practically for the early bird special, and we still had to wait for more than 30min. The host was very friendly, and the bar tender was great (he offered us drinks or water while we stood and waited for our table), and I was really hoping for some spectacular food to make it worth my while. And well, not so much.  It was sort of your average/SLIGHTLY better than average Italian food. I (of course) ordered the gnocchi that came in a tomato sauce with a dollop of ricotta. I've definitely had better (cough cough see Dimmi review), and my friend had a strange mix of pasta with mushrooms, brie, spinach, and ricotta. The mushroom flavour was a little overwhelming, and my tomato sauce was really subpar. Our dishes were both $14.50-$16 price range, which I found a little steep. The portions aren't huge either.  They had all the usuals, pizza, good salads, decent dessert menu. But even the wine by glass menu didn't wow me - a pinot for $, meh.   I was stumped for a drink, so the server (who was lovely, I have to give credit where credit is due - great staff), brought me a 'killer kool-aid'. Subpar, definitely not killer.   Kent P. nailed it... \"a big pile of MEH\"  ps. I like to be WOWED by the complementary bread. That's not even hard to do! And yet...they came up short. Meh meh mehhhh"}
{"text":"I had their \"special\" of Seafood Linguine, which I've been told happens to always be their special every single day.  They may as well just put it on the menu if this is the case.  The plate itself is actually quite a large size, the linguine is place upon of a big plate of mussels, mixed with a few shrimp and fish pieces.  The overall dish is just ok, I would opt for something else though as it's nothing special.  Although there are a lot of mussels, the meat inside is rather tiny.    Tip - We arrived just before 6pm on a Saturday and didn't not have to wait, as the place was only less than half full.  By 7pm, almost all the tables have been seated yet, so I would advise to come earlier than later."}
{"text":"Great menu, great quality food and usually fairly decent service. For what you're getting here (very authentic Italian cuisine) it is all quite well priced. We were ignored by our waiter periodically but it's a busy spot. An excellent meal and the best tiramisu you can find (probably) makes up for those shortcomings though."}
{"text":"Hello. I'd like to start this review off by saying that it's very late at night and I've had a long day. But I just wanted to get this review off my chest as it has been brewing in my mind for several days now. About 2 days ago, my partner and I (along with my parents) went to this restaurant on a whim for lunch. Being fans of the Italian language, we thought the name was fitting to our needs.  It was pretty empty and we were seated promptly. After a brief dispute over the pronunciation of the word Grazie, we got settled and took a look at the menus. Pizza? Pasta? We were in heaven, so we thought... There are many options on this menu, almost too many if you are a chronically indecisive individual like myself! Haha!   Our server (Jordan) came to say hello and to take our orders. He was fairly nice but quite awkward, and made me feel a little uncomfortable when he called the daily soup \"My Soup\" as if it belonged to him... Was he the owner? Did he create this soup? Is it a secret family recipe? I don't think it's your soup, Jordan...  Anyhow, my dad ended up ordering Jordan's soup and said it was absolutely delicious. It was a lentil soup which he described as \"homemade\"! Tasty!  We got some free bread at the beginning which is always a nice touch. It seemed rustic but I don't think it was. My mother ordered the bruschetta to start and, I must say, it did not disappoint! The tomatoes come on the side so you can even put them on top of the (ostensibly) rustic bread instead, if you so wish.   On to the entrees... I ordered the baked goat cheese salad which was actually really wonderful. I was having a mediocre experience so I wasn't expecting it to be so great. I was pleasantly surprised!   My dad (a nice man) ordered a seafood dish. He wanted some cheese sprinkled on it, because everyone else was having cheese and he wanted to be included in this cheese club. But the waiter said he doesn't recommend such a mixture (of cheese and seafood) and dad said he trusted that man. I still think it maybe wouldn't have been so bad and he wouldn't have had to feel so left out... Sorry dad... Although I don't think my dad should be eating too much cheese after his health scare 2 years ago. I do know how much he enjoys his cheese though so if it were up to me I would have allowed him to indulge in some cheese with this lunch. Such a shame that this had to happen...  My partner ordered pasta. It had spinach and chicken and pesto ricotta. My partner said it was passable but wasn't sure how to feel about Jordan claiming the daily soup as his own.   Sometime during our meal a young fellow at the table next to our stepped outside to take a call. We thought that very respectful of him as nobody likes a loud phone conversation intruding on their restaurant visit! I'm glad this establishment hosts such considerate patrons.  Grazie proved to be the Italian dining experience that we had all hoped for, minus the beautiful views! haha. With some hope we will come back here and order four entirely new meals. But one thing is for certain, we will be ordering bruschetta again.   To close, I want to add that Jordan really redeemed himself in my eyes when he brought us an extra red candy after noticing my partner and I getting into a heated argument about who should have the red candy (there was only one red on left with our bill and we both like red the best). He discreetly dropped the candy on to the table and didn't make any mention of it as not to embarrass us. Thanks Jordan! You really helped us avoid a horrible fight that day!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Italian in Toronto. The food is always so good. The service is fast and so friendly. I love the cheese and condiments they give on the side (you have to ask for this one). My favourite pasta is a tie between udine and Basta. Both cream based and sooo good. You can substitute the sauces however you like but I recommend sticking to the menu. I had a family friend visiting from Italy and she absolutely loved the gnocchi - said it reminded her of her grandma's homemade gnocchi she used to have when she was little. That's quiet a compliment to the chef!"}
{"text":"The only factors that would lower my rating would be the noise factor, and the not so warm service. We came there for a early lunch on a Wednesday, and were seated near the front, near others. The other tables were so loud, and yet the rest of the restaurant was quite empty. The redeeming factor was the food. Our waiter wasn't terribly friendly, but the food was good. We had the baked goat cheese salad ,  and the bruschetta pizza. The dough on the pizza was an excellent indicator as to their quality. Even though it was extremely loud and the service was luke warm, I'd be willing to give it another try for their pizzas. Ps. parking was difficult."}
{"text":"Cuts corners on quality. They add a bunch of fat into their sauces to hide the lack of taste and authenticity. Would not be surprised if they use boxed pasta and canned tomato sauce. As an Italian, I am shocked and a tad offended by the quality reviews for this place. They serve mainstream Italian food a step above Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is less of an authentic, quality Italian restaurant and more of a trendy hangout for mangiacakes who are oblivious to what they are eating. It's pretentious and serves average tasting pasta.  And with such an extensive menu, it's usually an indication one is incapable of making any one thing good. Also servers are obnoxious & discriminatory, especially if you look like you're not from the neighbourhood. I wouldn't put it past them to delay your order further for asking why it's taking so long. The price is moderately high and is not consistent with serving size and taste level. No self respecting Italian would pay what they are charging to eat here."}
{"text":"Went here on a date and was pleasantly surprised. It's bit hard to find parking, however the food was excellent quality. Definitely a popular spot, not a lot of space since it's so popular, however I would definitely recommend if you want quality Italian cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"I can't go often enough. They have a huge, delicious pasta menu, and great service. We used to live in the neighborhood, and would go weekly.  We left Toronto years ago, but whenever we're in town, we always go back."}
{"text":"Has been one of my fave Toronto restaurants for over 20 years. Was the first cool restaurant to enter the Yonge and Eglinton area. Has remained consistent, and always a stylish casual great crowd. No doubt one one the best north of St. Clair. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambiance and reasonable price. This place is great for family or for a date night. The thin crust pizza is amazing and the assisi was delicious! Nice waiters too!"}
{"text":"If you have any allergies please pass on this place. My guy is a celiac sufferer and got wheat poisoning from their corn pasta. They may be cooking it in the same water as the wheat pasta. Plus they over crowd the place."}
{"text":"Grazie is proof that you don't need an award winning, critically acclaimed chef to have a successful restaurant. It's a savvy business that understands its patrons. A lively place that serves delicious, rustic Italian food. I have recommended this place as a \"first date\" venue, but personally, I would never be caught dead here with anyone but my core: dear friends, family, committed lovers, etc.  While the company I eat with changes, my order does not.  The only time I ever try something new is if I steal a bite of a friend's dish.  What could possibly be so good that I order it every time? The answer: Tasca, fresh pasta stuffed with brie, porcini mushrooms and spinach in a creamy tomato sauce. I don't think I've ever had a more perfect plate of pasta.  My usual Grazie-eating partner also happens to be one of my favourite buddies, he ordered Elena - his favourite. But on our recent outing, he opted to try something new and had Stefania - pizza with a creamy porcini sauce, prosciutto, parmigiano and arugula.  It was nice - nutty and salty.  But I still wouldn't give up my Tasca for anything.  Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful...  Delizioso!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family. Classic Italian restaurant feel with a nice ambience. A little noisy at time but usually a fairly happening spot with lots of patrons coming and going. Food is tasty classic Italian, I wouldn't say it's anything special above and beyond but definitely nothing wrong with it either. A good meal every time I've visited. Good service and friendly staff, a nice menu with lots of options."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and everything is so cheap. Lovely atmosphere and great service. I live at king and bathurst and happily travel here because its so worth it. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place. Service is always good despite the restaurant always being busy. I really like the pasta here. The Gnoochi is my favourite. Nice sauces on the various pasta dishes. The apps are generally good as well. Prices are reasonable given the high quality of the dishes."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Friday night around 7pm and only had to wait about 10-15 mins before our table was ready.  They have a decent wine list along with a few select beers.   I opted for Nico (Pappardelle with saut√©ed veal strips, sundried tomatoes & mushrooms in a veal jus with a touch of cream) which was surprisingly light and very flavourful at the same time.  My boyfriend opted for the Catrina (Spinach linguine with grilled chicken, spicy pancetta (cured bacon), diced onions & black peppercorns) which was unique but not as well executed compared to the Nico.  Both pastas were executed to al dente so there was a nice texture to the pastas in every bite :)  Our server was very nice and attentive to us during our dinner. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"If I had been Yelpin' for the past 5 years I'd have some crazy badges for dining here. I love Grazie. Its casual, its simple, its pasta its Italian and its delicious!   Basta Basta Basta! Best pasta ever. I've tried almost everything on their menu in the pasta section but keep coming to that. The service is usually pretty good. If you're in North York or Vaughan, do pay Grazie a visit.  Im a Tiramisu destroyer - and the Tiramisu here is in my books the best! I hate it when restaurants serve tiramisu as a cake - its not a cake damnit! Grazie serves them in three scoops - which is perfect for sharing. Its light fluffy not too sweet not too strong and just melts in your mouth. Mmmmm I want me some more"}
{"text":"We had 12 in our group and service was slow.  The food is fresh and delicious, my linguini marinara was very good. Lots of mussels, cod, cuttle fish and shrimp and fresh handmade linguini. The atmosphere was the typical Italian restaurant around the Vaughan Mills area, sterile and not much character."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner.  We shared a Caesar salad. Just the right amount of garlic.  We had two different pizzas.  Topping combination was great. Perfectly cooked, tasty crust. Shared the Chocolate chip banana cake for dessert. Service by Giacomo was attentive and cheerful."}
{"text":"Great place if you're craving Italian food. The pasta is especially great here. And the service here is outstanding and they are always super friendly. Great place to go on a date!"}
{"text":"I'm mixed about this place. On the one hand it's good Italian food, if not best in this 'hood. It's a short walk north of eglinton subway so convenient to try. On the other hand, if your wanting Italian food, is say little Italy is your best bet for authentic Italian cuisine. Gracie is a very large location and lively atmosphere which makes it a great outing. One very special thing about this restaurant is how all ingredients are fresh for there dishes and you can taste that for sure. Friendly service each time. If uptown and in the mood for Italian food this is the best option w/o a doubt;"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is a regular at the place so I decided to try it out.  We went on saturday night and it was busy, but waited for no longer than 10 minutes to be seated (we were told it would be 20 at the beginning). Our server came quickly and service was good overall. I ordered Eligio pizza and it was good but not great for an authentic italian restaurant. On the other side, my girlfriend ordered Nico pasta (which I wish I've ordered) and it was delicious, the pasta itself had great texture and flavour, the veal and sauce were tasty."}
{"text":"Maybe I've had too many Chef Boyardee's in my lifetime that it's ruined what Italian food should taste like, but Grazie is not as great as the reviews are out to make it. I've been to this restaurant on 3 separate occasions and each time my meal has been alright - not bad, not great, just alright. Grazie is simply an OK restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times - always so happy to dine here with my family!  They don't take reservations so go early or prepared to stand in line.  Food is heavenly and the selection is wide.  I don't usually order desserts but the Tiramisu is delicious.  Mom in law loves the Nicco, husband loves the pizza and I love everything else.  Love the energy in the restaurant.  This is how it should be everywhere!!"}
{"text":"They've been around for 24 years so they know what they are doing. Grazie is pretty big and with many tables, when we went there was a line up but and told it would take 20 mins. The line went pretty quickly and had our table in less than 20 mins.  We had a nice table for 2 on one side, looks like all tables are pretty good seating. Service was on point and pretty swipe and our waitress hit all the right points, kind of mechanical but overall it was speedy.  Since it was famous for the pasta's we decided to try 2 of the sauces, Napoletena (Linguini with shrimps &clams) in Tomato Sauce and the Odessa (Fettucini with smoked salmon & vodka).   I think with such a big restaurant and so many tables it's hard to make each dish perfect, it's tasted like a good pasta from chain restaurant. My Odessa was too oily and salty, the 'smoked salmon' wasn't the typical smoked salmon one would expect, it was like regular baked/cook.  The Napoletena was much better with an balanced taste. Good flavour and the noodle was stringy and tasty. Sauce was good as well. Will go for the Tomato Sauce next time.  Overall it was a good experience and good place to bring a date. Good location as well. But don't expect authentic blow out of your mind food. Good place to bring a date, safe choice.  Dishes: Odessa (Fettucini with smoked salmon & vodka) 2.7/5 Napoletena (Linguini with shrimps & clams) 3.5/5   Food 3./5 Service 4/5 Ambiance 3.7/5 Value 4/5  ========= Overall 3.3"}
{"text":"Solid 4 for sure, some food items are a definite 5 but the ambiance and decor is nothing special and it can get pretty loud when there are large parties.   The Basta is an absolute must order. The pasta is so fresh and delicious and the cream sauce and shrimp perfectly complete the dish. The baked goat cheese salad is another epic menu item. The goat cheese is baked in filo so this is a richer salad - you can share to take away 50% of the guilt but you probably want it all for yourself.   We also had the chocolate brownie cheesecake which was a solid 4 and the Tasca pasta which was good but paled in comparison to the Basta."}
{"text":"Dropped in here on a Sunday night around 9pm and was seated immediately.  It's the first time I've tried Grazie but I've been told it's a reliable spot and been in the neighbourhood for years.  I have a soft spot for wood oven pizza and ordered the Roberto.  The pizza had plenty of toppings on it which was nice.  The outter crust was crispy, but the middle was still quite soggy (but not raw).  The toppings may have soaked through a bit, but overall it was still good.  My date had the Varese salad, which was nice and light with plenty of sliced pears, prosciutto and cheese.  Our service was OK.  Pretty much straight and to the point.  We had asked for some paper napkins but it was forgotten - not a big deal.  I would say the main attraction to this place is the fairly inexpensive price point and the better than average food."}
{"text":"Went with my friend as he said he wanted pasta, and we were in the area. Upon entering, I really enjoyed the decor and ambiance. With a rustic, Tuscan villa look, it gave a wonderful, Italian feel!  One of the best parts of Italian restaurants are the bread they give you. The crust was crispy and the insides were soft, but the bread itself was a bit cold. Always better to get your bread freshly out of the oven, but a good pairing with the olive oil and vinegar.  The pasta options were very diverse, but one the slightly pricier side. With $15.00 being the lowest ticketed pasta, it was pretty good. I got the Avellino and my friend got the Penza. Quite the contrast between the two, but both had their own delights. The Avellino was light and flavourful without being too oily, since it was with an extra virgin olive oil and garlic sauce. With beautiful prosciutto and spinach, it paired well with the al dente fettucini. The Penza was nicely creamy without being heavy. The pancetta created a nice contrast in texture to the rigatoni that was cooked perfectly.   Service was quite good overall, as we got a second round of bread for our table and constant topping of water without having to ask. Could have given us more olive oil and vinegar for the bread, but our pastas had come so it wasn't a big deal.   Overall a nice experience. Would love to sit on the patio if I ever come again, but with pastas slightly pricier than I usually have, I probably won't plan a visit back here. May just stumble in like this visit!"}
{"text":"This is our local. They treat us like family and the food can't be beat.  Make sure to ask for the parma misto, get Jack as your server and Adriano as your bartender. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Probably the most popular spot at YnEg, and for good reason! The place is always packed, but it's well worth the wait. The baked brie appetizer is delish. And they have a pasta for everyone! Sometimes, when I'm craving Grazie pasta, I call in an order for pick-up. So good!"}
{"text":"This place is a good option if you are craving for some pasta or pizza.  The restaurant is close to Vaughn Mills mall and parking is plentiful.  I believe they have another location in the Yonge/Eglinton area.  The Vaughn location is newer.    The food is decent here. I got the capri pasta which is linguine with shrimps and clams in a garlic and olive oil sauce.  They make their own pasta which is very nice.  The dish was very tasty but I feel for the price they could have been a little more generous with the portion size.  I also got a margherita pizza to share with my table mates.  The pizza was good but nothing to write home about.  I don't think I will be back as there are so many other italian places in York region that are just as good and better value."}
{"text":"I don't really know why people line up for this restaurant, obviously they haven't been to other better Italian places. I find the pasta mediocre, and similar to some quick meals I can fix at home.   Worst part of our meal was the fact that our friend found a fly in his pasta! And it was not a tiny fly but a huge fly, not that it makes a big difference but just visually revolting. And all he got was a free drink. I definitely thought his meal should have been free. And a higher end restaurant would have given us the whole meal free. Giant flies are not acceptable in any dish at any restaurants.   I definitely will not come back because I question the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hi and Good morning to the staff at Grazi, and a special thank you for the welcome, and, my waiter Des (short for Desmond thanks to the two cute ladies whom were might I add very polite, and the one who showed her appreciation in not only her manners, but also with affection-a thank you to you-you are very kind, and, a treat to see).  I am very impressed with the management, and I commented to one that \" I see they still hire the best\", and, I enjoyed a pizza which was the best I had in years, thanks to Des and, the management of this upscale and, classy place.  J.P.  I have something small for Des-thanks for your amazing service. July10th, 2017.I went by on July 9th late at night."}
{"text":"I am really not sure what all the hype about this place is ? I was told by many people it's the best place to eat.   I went in with high hopes thinking this would be finally something I can call my favourite. Although this wasn't the case after ordering our dishes.   There is a plethora of choices on their menu, it's rather disorganized and hard to choose. The restaurant doesn't really have a focus on specific dishes or what they offer.   My boyfriend ended up getting a stroganoff type lasagna. And I ordered the seafood fettuccine.   Upon receiving the food, mine had one of those gigantic octopus tentacles in the dish which was under cooked and cold. Most the seafood seemed to have a sour taste and not very fresh. Especially the muscles . The dishes were also extremely salty. I couldn't finish even a few bites without feeling like I'd turned into a canned anchovy.   I recommend leaving the neighbourhood and trying some Italian places downtown. As Yonge and eglinton at this point in time still lacks in the food area !"}
{"text":"Request a seat at the front, or eat at the bar if they are super packed. The pizza is great and the salmon is always moist and rich with flavor. I actually enjoy sitting at the bar and chatting with the locals. I am a sucker for great wood fired pizza, so I give it a 4. Plus, I heart Yonge Street...Last time we were there, our bar \"neighbor\" told us that there was another Italian restaurant started by the previous co-owner of Grazie, but we had too much vino to remember its name...."}
{"text":"We went for Lunch after my son's hockey game at a nearby arena.    I can strongly recommend the following pasta dishes: Bologna - Rigatoni in a hearty meat sauce Gnocchi - Gnocchi in a tomato sauce topped with ricotta Prato - Fettuccine with grilled chicken & green onions Amalia - Spinach filled ravioli with prosciutto (cured ham), green onions & asparagus  The whole experience was a treat."}
{"text":"My friend promised a \"Cheap and Cheerful\" meal and that's exactly what Grazie is.  This restaurant is Always busy, with people spilling out of the restaurant, even in Winter.  Fortunately, we ventured in early on Saturday and managed to grab a table right by the window.   The restaurant is huge with seating stretching to the back.  It's energetic and busy but i wouldn't say it is loud. It looks exactly like a big, friendly Italian eatery.   Food: Bruschetta: I don't know what they brush the bruschetta with prior to grilling but it was delish; not your usual olive oil. The tomato was tasty too.   I had the Capri- Linguine with shrimps and clams tossed in olive oil. The flavor had depth and was tasty; nothing i've tasted at an Italian restaurant. The shrimps and clams were pretty tiny, but i overlooked that because the entire dish was just tasty.   My friend had the Bosco and i had  taste of it; rich, creamy and topped with mushroom- yum  The only thing that kinda annoyed us was our server. She initially asked if we wanted anything to drink but we'd just sat down :30 ago so we said just water and lemon. When she came back to take our orders, she hurriedly sped through the process, grabbed our menus w/o asking us again if we wanted something else to drink, before speeding off. We would have ordered wine but didn't bother asking her since she was in such a hurry. Additionally, when she came to check in with us, she didn't bother to wait for our reply, didn't look at us...pretty much just sped through us. She could have slowed down a little and made more money...we didn't bother ordering drinks or dessert.   Other than that, highly recommend for an efficient, tasty meal in Y&E"}
{"text":"This is a very popular pasta place in town. I love that fact that they have a large menu selection. You will definitely find your favourite paste there.   Since this place is very popular, they don't take reservation. Thus make sure you go early during weekends, otherwise you need to wait at the door.   Food: Their pasta is always great. I love their deep fried calamari and steamed mussels as well. However, i am not a big fan for their dessert.  Price: Similar to all other restaurants. Not too pricey.   I always ordered the same thing from their menu. Maybe i will try something different next time."}
{"text":"I've been to grazie 3 times in one week haha. just legit the greatestttt pasta!  Their pasta gives this place 4 stars, but I have to say that their pizza is seriouslyyyyy lacking.  I've tried 3 of their pizzas now and it's just not that good.  Do NOT order any of them.  Also, their desserts suck.  Tried the apple tart and it seemed kind of stale and I didn't even finish it.  Also had some chocolate chip banana cake and the cream in between the layers of cake was gross.  Basically picked it all out and just ate the cake which wasn't even moist.  Stick to the pastas only and you will leave happy :)"}
{"text":"Oh Grazie!  Always packed and always good. Super friendly staff, great service and my personal favourite pasta spot. The price is also excellent. Really friendly atmosphere and a must for anyone in the local area."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place! Their pastas are all amazinggg. I had the Trapini (Spaghetti with grilled eggplant, fresh peppers & zucchini).  Super fresh, yummy tomato sauce, good portion, just GREAT.  But the highlight for me is the pasta my friend had. Tasca (pasta filled with ricotta, spinach, mushrooms & brie baked in a creamy tomato porcini sauce).  my.goddddd.  I had a bite and legit wanted to steal her entire plate.  The mix of everything together is perfect! Fair warning though if you don't like mushrooms you will prob hate this dish because the mushroom flavour is overwhelmingly good.  I have been thinking about it non stop and I'm going back this week to eat it again :)  They give you free bread to start, but its pretty hard and nothing exciting.  We also got the appetizer special that day which was octopus.  Pretty fresh and it came with some  cold veggies with feta and mash on the bottom.  The mash was a little sour which I didn't really like but that's not the highlight of the dish anyways.    I want to come back n eat all the pastas haha. This place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the eligio pizza. The pizza had a good amount of prosciuttino, mushrooms, and asiago cheese. The freshness of the pizza was reflected in the sauce and the crispness of the crust.  The service was decent and the wait time was about 15-20mins. Overall a great lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Very nice place, well decorated and comfortable. Among my favorites is ravioli and tiramisu. Tried other dishes and they were tasty, fresh and well served. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best restaraunts located at Yonge & Eglinton.  Best Italian restaraunt in the neighbourhood.  Grazie has a great atmosphere, pleasant staff, great bar for not just alcohol but espresso drinks.  This restaraunt is almost always filled, if they're open, they're busy so reservations are highly recommended.  Reasonably priced for the quality & service. Almost every appitizer on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"This is far and above my favourite Italian eatery. I know that I will always have amazing food and amazing service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had been years ago and always remembered how much fun it was and how delicious it was, and had always wanted to go back. Last year I found myself living at Yonge and Eglinton, and for the 8 short months I stayed in the area, I was a happy regular here. The staff are incredibly outgoing, the first time I stopped by on my way home from a bike ride just to read the menu in the window. The host literally came outside and told me how much better it is inside, and that I should just come in and enjoy a nice meal! They are obviously very welcoming, and I find that quality is consistent among all the staff.  I LOVE that you can add, change and make substitutions with no hassle. The cost is fair and the portions are generous. My favourite choice for modifications is the Teramo, I always add chicken and sub spelt pasta. It's extra $, but well worth it, and I (usually) have leftovers for lunch the next day.  My favourite with no changes is Nico. I hate to love it because of the veal, but it's SO GOOD!  Best appetizer, in my opinion is the baked goat's cheese salad. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  And the Tiramisu is to die for. Just saying.  I find the wine list reasonable, and the coffee and espresso is quite good.  The service is pretty consistent, and everyone is very thoughtful. Once after a minor issue with my meal, which was not a big deal (I ate it and enjoyed it) I saw that our coffees had been comped. Very nice surprise. And another time, after spending almost 4 hours eating and drinking and talking too loudly whilst on a double date, we had complimentary Grappa shots delivered to the table. Again, quite a nice surprise considering most places would have wanted us gone at that point!  So, if you're looking for down to earth, delicious and welcoming, where you can wear jeans and a tshirt or dress up for date night, this is your place."}
{"text":"A very popular restaurant in Yonge-Eglington area.  Be prepared to wait for your table (don't take reservations).   The food is always fresh and quality consistent. Nothing stands out as \"wow\" or totally unique / innovative, but nothing is terrible either -- the kind of place you feel safe to bring a group to, everyone can find something that's edible.   Well laid out menu, pastas are grouped by the sauce type: red, creamy red, white, and oil. Save room for dessert, Tiramisu is quite good.   Reasonable prices, good value."}
{"text":"Came here recently for a gathering and since I was craving prosciutto, I tried their Stefania pizza. The pricing was a bit steep but nonetheless, the pizza was great. There was a generous amount of prosciutto and arugula across the entire pizza and the crust wasn't overwhelmed with sauce - it was just the right amount.   Judging by how packed the restaurant became as the night went on, one could easily tell that this was not only an authentic Italian and family-friendly restaurant, but also a community favourite. The staff were all incredibly nice (but also incredibly busy) and I had an overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is a laid-back pleasant Italian eatery that I always rely on.  I love their creative and extensive range of pastas.  It's very helpful that they break their menu down by sauces.   This is by reliable choice to meet up with people, if we're coming from Uptown and Downtown."}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner, but usually very busy. Staff is professional,  food is good and not too pricey."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and the food has never disappointed me. It's great for large groups and corporate functions (they have a space in the back which is pretty secluded). The prices are reasonable.  Try the Udine Pasta (Linguini with goat cheese, roasted peppers & mushrooms), it's to die for."}
{"text":"I really have to thank my co-worker for introducing me to Grazie. Their Tasca pasta is my go-to main. It's basically a giant pasta dumpling stuffed with spinach, different cheeses and mushrooms, topped with ros√© sauce. It sounds quite simple, but it is to die for!!  I have also had their mussels and calamari, and I only have good things to say about those appetizers! With all desserts at a set price of $8, how can one say no?! I found their chocolate cake to be decadent and soft. Their tiramisu balls were creamy and all the flavours melded well with each other, nothing was too overpowering.  As a heads up, they tend to have a line during prime hours and don't take reservations on the weekend, which is a bummer, especially when you have large parties. There is parking around the corner and I do believe they validate parking.  Regardless of the distance from my house and the wait times, I love Grazie and will come back for their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Okay this is my first time writing my review, but I just had a really good time that i had to review it. The service was really great and the pasta was really tasty!!(Not to forget, their bread too) I went there past 6 on friday just by myself but they let me sit at the table and have a nice relaxing dinner. It can be a bit loud when its get full but it also gives that nice lively atmosphere. Would love to come back again for different dish."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on Saturday (yesterday)  There was an older man serving us  I had gotten home from work at 5 am the night before and therefore i was very tired, no makeup and had a sweater on ...  Once he took our order , I asked if i could add pancetta on my pasta-    This man had the audacity to say to me 'did you bring money with you?'  With an attitude , and chuckled ..........  I dont think I need to say much more.   Pasta was pretty crap as an addition, very watery rather than creamy, lacked flavour.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good italian tastes,in a cozy athmosphere... Diving pasta section according to the sauces is a very practical idea.. great choice for casual italian!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  Grazie is definitely a longstanding Yonge & Eg staple. That being said I don't think I've ever had anything there of note. The menu is large, all the food is reasonably good but nothing stands out.  THE FOOD- Pretty typical Italian fare. The last time I was there my friends and I shared a starter, pasta, pizza and dessert. We had a burata as a starter which was very good, the pizza was good, but in a city full of amazing pizza didn't stand out and the pasta was saltier than it needed to be. The banana chocolate cake we had for dessert was very nice.  THE SPACE- It's a big restaurant which means I've never had to wait for a table. But it also means it's always fairly noisy.  THE SERVICE- I've never had any issues with the service here, it's prompt and polite."}
{"text":"First timer here and I loooveddd it. They have a wide selection of Pastas, and you get a generous portion of meat/seafood in it. Service was on point - credit to the waiters here that memorize the specials in detail. The portions you get for the price is worth, and the quality is fantastic. It's quite loud here (at least on a Saturday) so might not be a good place for a serious conversation, but this is now the best pasta place on my list!"}
{"text":"This is definitely at the top of my list when I want a regular Italian meal without all the fancy decor and overpriced food. I've had a lot of experiences of going to \"upscale\" Western restaurants (usually Italian), paying a premium for the fancy decor while getting mediocre food. Grazie offers many pasta and pizza options at fair prices. And most importantly the taste is awesome!  There's something for everyone. They have a very good selection of pastas and pizzas. Cream sauce, tomato sauce, pesto sauce, you name it! If you want wine, they have too. The ingredients they use are very wholesome. Service is nice too. And their menu is easy to navigate.  It's no mystery why this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Whenever I choose to go to go an Italian restaurant, I really fight the urge to order everything in a terrible accent. That said, I enjoyed myself at GRATT-SIEEE! Sorry, had to get it out of my system.  Interior is nothing special. You`re not going to feel like you`ve been transported to Italy. If you`re really into things like ambiance, this probably isn`t the place for you.  Server was friendly, accessible, and not overbearing. I appreciate that. A server who becomes over friendly or hovers makes me uncomfortable. He seemed to be there whenever we needed anything and not when we didn`t. I hope that doesn`t come off as too rude.  The important thing: food. I had the giardina pizza. The pizza was cooked well and the portion was good. It didn't wow me, but it was far from disappointing.  My girlfriend had the Udine pasta. This was better than the pizza. The sauce was really creamy and the pasta itself was perfect. Decent sized portion as well.  We ended having a beer and a glass of wine each and ended up paying $80 together including tax and 18% gratuity (we had a group of 8).   Overall, positive dining experience. Would recommend if you're in the area and in the mood for some Italian."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for 5 times over the past few years.   Food quality is consistently good, however, price has been raising (both wine and food).  However, if you enjoy fresh made pasta, this is still a good place to go."}
{"text":"haven't been here in a long time so thought we'd try it out again...I remembered good food without exorbitant prices.  Won't be going back!  We waited in the line to be seated for 20 minutes ..the host was very nice and came outside to tell us our table was ready but it went downhill from there.  we ordered bruchetta pasta and the veal. A couple was seated beside us 5 mins later and got bread... We never got bread.  This couple got their food 15 mins before we did. My pasta had a runny soup-like sauce.  I hardly could stomach it. My boyfriend said his veal was ok.  I think he had one beer and me 2 glasses of wine and our bill was outrageous!  I have no idea why it's still lined up on weekends. The quality and service has gone down. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Whenever I walk past this restaurant, it is always packed. I finally decided to try this place with a friend and it was not bad at all.  The bartender was quite flirty, but not creepy. The server joked a bit with us and provided some recommendations. The food was mediocre and the prices were reasonable. I had the penza, which was rigatoni with vodka sauce and pancetta. It was just fine, nothing special. I also had the tiramisu, which is house made, but it was not tasty at all; too dry and not sweet enough.   The restaurant was quite crowded and loud. I wish that they had spaced the tables out better. I wouldn't go back, as there are far better Italian restaurants to visit in the city and they seem to be doing just fine with my business."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both were for family functions.  The food is decent at best but I'm not really a fan of their pizza.  I don't know how they make it but the crust seems far too thick and tough (overdone?) to be anywhere near authentic Neapolitan.    Their pasta is just OK as well.  The flavor and presentation are ok but the serving size was sort of small and it wasn't anything that blew me away.  They did have some other good items like the baked goat cheese inside of a phyllo pastry with red peppers and eggplant and an arugula salad.    We had a couple antipasto platters to start and they had a nice mix of some items like pear with Gorgonzola, parmigiana cheese, olives, soppressata, and prosciutto.  Also they were overly generous with the bread that seemed to keep coming which is good to soak up the sauces but they also offered us olive oil as a dipper too.  My wife and I had a pizza each.  Hers was called a Romana \"Potatoes, fresh rosemary, pancetta (cured bacon), diced tomatoes, mozzarella & parmigiano cheese\".  I had a quattro formaggi \"Gorgonzola, ricotta, crotonese and fior di latte\".  To me the pizza seemed dry and overcooked perhaps.  The crust seemed harder than my liking or what I'm more used to which is wood oven type crust which is chewier and softer.  For my main I had the breaded veal which was in a red wine sauce with rapini and roasted potatoes.  The veal was good and the portion size was actually large.  Between the pizza, bread, antipasto, and pasta I was pretty full but we ended up taking home the leftovers.  While I thought the service was very good, the food here is just OK.  The dining area is nice but as far as Italian food goes this is by no means the best there out there but it's not bad.  The prices ok, the service is very good and the ambiance is nice.  We had 2 tables of ten for our large party so they are equipped to handle large parties."}
{"text":"This is a place where you can sit back after a meal and you just think \"f*** yes\". Fantastic service. Every time our server came to check on us and asked if everything was ok (which was often) I wanted to take him by the hand with tears in my eyes and make him feel the intensity of how amazing I felt. I came with the girlfriend and shared the Roberto pizza to start, let me say that I strongly oppose the use of unnecessary utensils, but this pizza was so beautiful I even used a napkin. As a main, I got the paesana pasta. Most places in Toronto taste like they get their pastas from the same bag of \"general pasta\" but here you could really taste the ingredients. They weren't shy with the meat and the portion was good. Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The desert menu was overwhelming with choices that all sounded great. You could go back several times and get a new dessert each time. Strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend and got seated right away. As some others have said they gave us cold bread. And this blows my mind everytime I go to an Italian bread and get cold bread! What is with that?! We tried two pasta dishes, one if them with cream sauce. Their names escape me but they were good! They were tasty and portions were enough. The staff were nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I've Dined in before and had a great experience. Food was delicious as well as a friendly atmosphere. Due to this, I decided to order delivery.   I ordered 3 pasta dishes and a Margherita Pizza and a Caesar Salad. The delivery came on time so i was happy to see the caliber of service was still reflected on take out/ delivery customers.   After checking the order, the Margherita Pizza i ordered came with no Basil. Now, most people know the basic Margherita Pizza consists of Cheese, Basil and Tomato Sauce. The Pizza that was delivered was a plain cheese Pizza... I called Grazie to let them know that they have got my order wrong and was expecting some level of service, but all i got were excuses such as:  1. Basil is normally extra 2. \"Come on man, its only missing basil\" 3. It normally does not come with Basil.... (um you sure? your whole menu states basil)  Now, in the end, it is just basil but my complaint is more about how the person on the phone conducted himself and tried to argue with the fact that i should just take the pizza as is because its only 3 dollars... keep in mind 3 dollars with take plus your delivery charge plus tip works out to $5.   In conclusion in a reluctant voice they reimbursed me for the pizza but i was more so unimpressed with whomever that was on the phone.   The food itself still tasted great."}
{"text":"the waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had anywhere and because of him the food was cold i also ordered a bottle of water that he never brought but as he was bringing the bill said \"oh do you want me to bring you your bottle of water now\" and it was on the bill I will never go back espically with Marcellos Pizzeria a few doors down"}
{"text":"After a winterlicious fail (wasn't aware that it wasn't offered at lunch time), my bf and I came to visit grazie instead and it was the best decision ever. I had heard so many good things about grazie and today was a good opportunity to try it out. We were greeted by whom I think was the owner and was seated right next to the window..so nice. I didn't know what to order but knew for sure I wanted to try the pasta (the pizza can wait). I eventually decided to try the Torino in a creamy tomato sauce. Man that sauce is delicious and if no one was there I would've wiped that plate clean. Lol my bf ordered the Bianca, a cream sauce pasta and he said it was delicious. We also had the bruschetta as an app and thought that was alright. The bread they gave us in the beginning was quite dry.  Anyway, service was okay our server was friendly but wished he smiled more. I'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place with amazing Pasta. I had the Milano pasta it looked so good i didnt have time to take a picture. I will definitely be back to try the Penza pasta."}
{"text":"Great if u like pasta. Grilled salmon was very good. All the food was well prepared. Good service."}
{"text":"I would even go as far as 4 1/2.  I went once years ago before they moved spots and wasn't pleased, but tried it again recently.  Wow, big improvement.  I will no longer wait 45 minutes for Marcellos, this place is as good or better without any wait time.  I love the mussels appetizer and the penne a la vodka is great, bursting with flavor."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is amazing. The mussels are fresh, cooked in a tomato wine sauce ! I'm not a pizza person, but the pizza is done tastefully. Pasta is always hot, and full of flavour. Portions are large, definitely a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant in the neighbourhood. EVERY single item we have ever ordered here has been absolutely delicious. The service is great and staff always friendly.  The Amalia pasta dish is my favourite - have ordered it many times and it has never disappointed my picky taste buds :) Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great Italian food and who doesn't mind cozy seating and great local buzz."}
{"text":"One of the best family-style Italian restaurant in town. Whenever I crave for savory pasta but do not want to lash out, Grazie is my go to place.   The ambience and deco are more to the cozy side, and might get a little loud for first date during the weekend dinner. However, it would be a perfect spot for friend gathering and intense but relax occasions. Servers are very friendly.  There is a large selection of both traditional and unique pasta on the menu. My personal all time favorite is Catrina - the spinach linguini with grilled Chicken, and Nico - Pappardelle with saut√©ed veal strips. Never had the chance to try appetizers, but their pizza, cocktail and dessert are all satisfactory, and the portion size is HUGE."}
{"text":"I was always curious as to why I would see hoards of people making reservations or trying to get into this local Italian stop. Now I know the answer.  My male pal took me out here (thanks luis) and recommended me the bologna. Although it was noisy at times, the general atmosphere was chill and homy. My only complaint would be that it seems that the staff take on more than they are capable of. Not that the service was bad, the service was wonderful, it just seemed so busy and hectic to the point of being somewhat sloppy. Typical bread starter, which is always a nice palette cleanser. Meal arrived pretty quickly, and the food itself had this very authentic home made vibe to it (being Italian myself it's always nice to see that present in a restaurant close by and not all the way in little italy). Pasta was perfectly cooked (not always easy to do) and was very fresh. Delicious meal, just wish I could've enjoyed it more without feeling like I might embarrass myself if I was messy.   Could do for an expansion, don't know how, just wish it was a bigger layout so it wouldn't seem like such a clustered and crowded environment. Other than that, nice food, good location, I didn't pay so I wouldn't be sure of the price ranges, and my buddy walked me all the way home after.   Nice evening, next time, I'll get one of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"It's a popular restaurant. Glad I went there early and avoided the wait. We ordered Baked Goat Cheese Salad, Penza, and Amalia. Loved Baked Goat Cheese Salad. It comes with a pastry bread with goat cheese and grilled eggplant stuffed inside. Never had this kinda salad before. Penza was good, creamy tomato sauce and a little bit spicy. Amalia was okay. Would like to try some of their other pastas next time."}
{"text":"Passed several times and finally get to try it. The Nico pasta is amzaing!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive and fast service. We ordered a Branca salad, Giuseppe pizza, Napoletana pasta ( w shrimps & clams) to share. The server was thoughtfully enough to separate the pasta dish into two portions which should deserve a good tip! Ordered their famous and scrumptious Tiramisu. Yummy! Bread served at the beginning was a little cold, would be perfect if it's freshly baked. Overall Highly recommend this rest !! Got there at 6:15 pm on Friday night and there was table available for 2, but big tables were already gone. the place also got a lot busier when we left around 8pm. No reservation for dinner."}
{"text":"To me, you can never go wrong with Grazies, I don't think it's amazing Italian food, and it doesn't have much other than pizza and pasta, but it's a place you can trust to have a good meal at. Prices are reasonable and it's perpetually packed. I usually opt for a seat at the bar to avoid the long wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get together with friends and enjoy a very good meal. Ive been to the Eglinton location many times, but this location is way bigger. Went there after some good tennis at Veneto in Woodbridge. Had to wait about 45 mins for a table (arrived at about 8pm peak - long waiting list) but we had a great time waiting at the bar, so it was ok, and worth the wait.  Food - excellent (we ordered 4 mains and shared - all of them were excellent - no complains at all - pastas were made to perfection aldente!! Ambience - very nice - nicer compared to the Eglinton location, had a very long and big bar for waiting - nice music from salsa to slow euro house - dress code is from casual to smart casual / dressy Service - was very good, some waiters were from the Eglinton location! Price point - reasonable - good for the quality and portion  Definitely will go back there - probably again after a tennis game."}
{"text":"Came here at 1pm, no line up.  I DID NOT try their pizza just chicken pasta.  dont see any amazing service.  At the end Don't see any special in this, nothing good or bad meet the standard of the given price. the bread i had try better. had to Agreed with Brad M about the pasta.food is hot enough / great / not too creamy .. but not so great that i can smell it / or make you flick your tail like a dog lol. if they only make pizza and pasta... i do expect more...from the pasta..so this rate in in the edge of like 2.8 star."}
{"text":"I admit to being difficult to please and was put off by the servers refusal to give me a larger glass of ice water insisting he'd keep my glass full. To my shock this server magically succeeded at his promise and delivered superbly throughout this wonderful meal. The simple olive oil on the table for the bread is so rich and wonderful that I've searched far and wide to find something similar for my own kitchen. The rest of the meal from appetizer, to main course, to desert was absolutely incredible. This restaurant deserves all the praise it gives and those who refuse to give it a 4 star or greater must simply be bitter, confused about the restaurant they were eating in, or there on the night the chef's mother died. One thing for sure plan for a wait in this simple looking Italian restaurant--the number of patrons says it all about the success of consistently good food and service at Grazie Ristorante."}
{"text":"The best Italian Restaurant in the uptown Toronto area! Can't w8 to go there! Their Ravioli is homemade & delicious!!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian joint on Yonge! I came her multiple times so you can tell it's great! I came here recently with a friend to celebrate a birthday. They don't take reservations so it's best if you arrive early with your party.  It's often very busy on weekends and Friday nights. I had the muscles (cozze portofino) steamed mussels in a light tomato sauce. You can choose white wine sauce as well. The flavour was great super savoury. For my main I had the Amalia (spinach filled ravioli with prosciutto, green onion and asparagus). My all time fave pasta at Grazie.  I generally don't like ravioli but this dish has changed my mind. At dinner time the portion is huge, I could barely finish. The pasta was super flavourful, rich and creamy. I always go back there and order the same thing over and over again. Not to mention the staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience with the host of the restaurant (the larger curly haired gentleman). I had arranged to have dinner with 6 friends at Grazie - the food was good, the host was not. He was very abrasive and rude once we had already paid and were leaving the restaurant. He has no idea how to serve paying customers that are supporters of their restaurant. I have been going to this Grazie location for years and have introduced it to many friends, after this experience I will definitely NOT be recommending this restaurant. In fact, I will be making sure to take my business to a restaurant that knows how to hire/train proper host and wait staff."}
{"text":"I've been to many Italian restaurants and this is one of the worst ones I've been to.  First off, make sure to book a reservation on weekends since it can get very busy. We waited for 45 minutes before we were seated in the crowded dining area. I ordered pasta with shrimp and it was not good. The sauce was very liquidy and the pasta was overcooked. It didn't have much flavour either. I wouldn't return here. Much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place was basically perfect in every way. Amazing food. Best Italian we've had in Toronto so far. Casual clean and warm ambiance. Impeccable service. Our server was perfect in every way. It is not usual for me to write such a perfect review but seriously we were impressed by the service at this place and the professionalism of our waiter. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place  Been here too many times to count  Food is great   Service is great  Got even the cookbook for the restaurant and a few pastas from it  Bruschetta pizza is on point there  Their take on the penne a la vodka dish is super yummy.....believe it's called Penza  The spinach pasta dishes are super yummy  Catrina has pancetta and peppercorn  Amalia is the spinach ravioli  Had also a fixing of Bosco when I was feeling like a mushroomy type pasta  Toronto location is still the best as it's the original  Will keep going back for my Italian fix"}
{"text":"It's my birthday and I can't think of a finer present to give myself than Amalia at Grazie, with a Moretti to begin and perhaps a Sauvignon Blanc to compliment the asparagus, and of course the procutto."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! We went on a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed. We were greeted immediately by the bartender and he seated us right away.   All the restaurant staff was so attentive despite it being so busy. The food here is always amazing. They've got the best bruschetta and the bianca pasta is to die for!   The food came out quickly considering how busy it was.   This is our go to italian restaurant and with so many vegetarian options it's one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"My gf introduced this place to me as its her fav Italian restaurant and she loves the pasta. I on the other hand didn't enjoy it as much as my gf. The server was extremely nice, recommended a lot of dishes and you can tell he actually tried it or knows about the dishes and also recommended wine to pair with the dishes. We ordered 3 different pastas (not sure the names are but you can see in my pictures) and a pizza. The noodles are freshly made everyday so it does taste fresh but I wasn't too crazy about the dishes. They were just mediocre for me but I love how all ingredients are freshly made!!   For desserts, all of them aren't in house made except for the flourless dark chocolate cake. And it was my fav!! It's bitter and sweet at the same time. Yum   This wouldn't be my choice of my Italian restaurant but if my friends wanted to go I wouldn't mind going with them."}
{"text":"(As a preface: my friend suggested a 3.5-star rating here, but since that is not possible, I had to go up to 4-stars since the food was definitely better than average.)  After some Ikea shopping last week on Superbowl Sunday, my friend suggested Grazie Ristorante for dinner; she had been there once before with someone else. It was not yet 5pm, so it was not very busy when we arrived, but more people arrived as time went on. We sat in a front corner, but it seemed to be a fairly large restaurant, divided into (at least) 2 rooms, with a well-stocked bar in the middle, and a nice display of cakes at the end of the bar. The background music was not too loud, and at one point they were playing The Beatles for every other song. The service was fine, with our water glasses being re-filled constantly.  We immediately were given a basket of bread, which was fine except that the bottom was rather stiff, so this made it difficult to cut apart. The bread was also re-filled a few times, and was much better once the entrees came as we could dip it into the sauces, which made it softer and quite tasty. The menu is mainly different pastas in a variety of sauces and a selection of pizzas. We both chose to have pasta dishes. I had the Tasca, which was pasta filled with cheese and spinach and mushrooms in a creamy tomato sauce. My friend had the Nico, which was broad noodles with saut√©ed veal and mushrooms and sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce. Both were very good; the pasta was well-cooked, the sauces very tasty, and the portions were large. Only afterwards did I remember about the cakes in the display, but I don't recall the server asking about dessert so I think it slipped my mind at the time.  Overall, not a bad dinner; $39 for two people with no alcoholic drinks. I wouldn't mind returning to try their pizza, and maybe a piece of cake for dessert."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about the food here. Everything I have tried has been stellar. Not just good, but great! Everything from the appetizers, to the mains, to the desserts (note: I loved the espresso). The food is sure to impress almost anyone.  This location is located in a plaza across Vaughan Mills shopping mall, and in an area where there are a ton of other restaurants and places to eat at. For this reason it took a couple years for me to get into Grazie, but let me tell you, I'm so glad that I did! I'm not Italian, but comparing to all the other Italian restaurants I've dined at, this ones seemed extra authentic. The little details seem to have made a big difference in my experience.  We had a large group, approximately 15-18 people. Though we made reservations we still ended up waiting close to 30 mins to be seated. However I noticed that people were really enjoying their meals, and also their dinner experiences. Everyone was so jovial and clearly enjoying their evening. I think that this is the reason why our reservations were delayed (you can't kick people out, can you? lol) -- which is a perfectly acceptable situation in my mind. People having a great time and staying longer may be bad for maximizing the number of patrons served, but makes a huge impact in the experience and memories patrons take away with them. Great experiences let people come back over and over again. FYI: we stayed longer than average as well, and I'm sure majority of us will be coming back.  Overall, the service was superb, the food was delicious, the ingredients extremely fresh and evidently of high quality, ambiance is nice though a bit loud, and it seems to always be packed - so people definitely love coming here.  This resto is a must try if you like pasta, pizza, Italian, or even just food in general! Grazie, Grazie... I leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"TakinG one star away bc we never love the service or the lack of parking here, but the food is always consistently great.   The Varese salad, and Catrina and Torino pastas will never disappoint, but the crazy wait? times can be a turn off.  Thankful they have 2 locations (2nd on near Vaughan Mills) and they even sell a recipe book for their most popular dishes... Although I have yet to be able to recreate them. Lol."}
{"text":"While Grazie usually gets a 5 from us, this last visit was a bit disappointing.    We ordered all our usual favourites. The Varese salad was perfect (arugula with prosciutto, pear, and parmesan). The Catrina (spinach long pasta with pancetta, onions and chicken), and the Torino (stuffed pasta with ricotta and spinach in rose sauce), and Margarita pizza for the kids.   The Catrina is supposed to be seasoned with peppercorn, which usually is very balanced, but today it totally masked the dish and I could barely get it down. We mentioned t to the server who although very nice, spoke to us like we've never had the dish before. We couldn't taste anything but pepper! The Torino was too el dente (again more then usual) and the bottom of the pizza was burnt, and the kids didn't finish it bc of the aftertaste.   The banana chocolate chip cake was ok, and the coffees were smooth.   This visit was far from perfect. Hoping it was just an off day. Will likely come back again in hopes they will redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Grazie is always packed! Food is great, service is excellent with a nice atmosphere!  I tried the special seafood pasta! Really good and enjoyed it! For desert we had the tiramisu! It's a bite from heaven so light and amazingly tasty!  I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a lively atmosphere. I personally very much enjoy the pizza!  Also, the staff and owner our incredibly friendly. Today, someone was being environmentally conscious and picking up garbage a few doors down from the restaurant, when the owner realized what was happening he immediately offered the woman complimentary food for being a good citizen! You have to love people who actually care enough to notice good deeds and reward them!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with co-workers here. It's a very nice looking Italian restaurant with pretty good food.  The pasta I got however was a bit too oily and not as al dente but overall still very tasty.  The tiramisu dessert was moist and delicious as well.  Food: 3/5, the peppercorn in my pasta was strong but the pancetta mix with spinach pasta was good.  The bruschetta was very garlic-y but good.  Service: 3/5, the waiter was funny and service overall was good  Ambience: 3/5, nice sized Italian restaurant with rustic feel. The chairs could be a little nicer. (Not great for tall people like me)  Price: 3/5, reasonable at around $20-$25/person"}
{"text":"I must admit I had higher expectations when we decided to have dinner here.  I'm not saying that it wasn't good because all in all we did enjoy dinner but it was just ok, the food was good (it's really difficult to scree up a pasta), the bruscheta pizza was excellent and the service was very good. One thing that was an issue for us was the noise, the restaurant is big and there are lots of people and it is pretty noisy, not a place you want to carry a deep meaningful conversation. Bottom line, not a bad restaurant but I don't think I'll go there again..."}
{"text":"the pizza here is pretty awesome!  so for two people, share an app and a pizza was more than enough. great food! the location was kinda annoying cuz finding a parking spot was just impossible. take the public transit."}
{"text":"Best pasta ever!!! We ordered a Milano and a shrimp and clamp pasta. The sauce taste so good and we just finish everything in less than 10 minutes. The only thing is they don't have a lot of seafood in the shrimp and clam pasta... Still 5* for the food- sauce is so good!!"}
{"text":"First time eating her in at least 20 years. I dimly remember eating here once before, but can't recall when & definitely don't recall my experience.  Went on a Thursday evening with my wife. A last-minute decision to eat out & we both felt like pasta, so decided to finally give this long-time Yonge & Eg eatery a try with no reservations. Arrived just after 6PM, & were seated immediately.   The interior of this place is old & tired. Definitely needs to be refreshed.   Service was friendly & efficient. No issues at all. We each had a starter, pasta dish & glass of wine & we were out by 7:15PM- just the way we like it for a casual mid-week dinner out.  Caesar salad- we both ordered & were somewhat disappointed. For myself, the dressing was correct, including the definite hint of anchovy in there. But the romaine was torn into huge pieces, making it difficult to eat. I donlt like using my knife when eating a green salad.  My wife had the fettucine Alfredo (they call it something else- why?) Pasta with cream, butter & parmesean cheese. She was disappointed- finding it too heavy & did not finish her plate.   I had the Bosco- cream sauce with mushrooms & rosemary. I found it just fine. Excatly what I expected- no more, no less.  We had two glasses of Italian red wine- 9oz size. The wine was a bit expensive in my opinion.  In summary, Grazie needs to renovate or refresh their space. The pasta was a-ok & the service was correct. If I lived in the immediate neighbourhood, I MIGHT go back once in a while for a pasta dish, but I would not go regularly. The food prices were relatively-speaking reasonable, but the wine was expensive."}
{"text":"No no no no no NO. I've heard great things about grazie and about the amazing 'authentic italian food', and excitedly brought my friends here.. well actually, I got in their car and made them bring me.. BIG MISTAKE!  We got seated immediately and it was a nice environment. No other asian spotting in the restaurant though. It was all white families enjoying their meals- a good sign, I thought. The waiter comes and gets our order and we proceed to wait half a century for our meals... ok, you make each order as you receive it, but it shouldn't be 40 minutes before anything comes. Oh wait, I lied.. the bread appetizer came.. but it was literally like chewing on rocks. So hard and it could've broken off my tooth. We also didn't get olive oil to dip it, like all the other tables did? Is it because we don't belong? Anyway, after I've aged to 80, the food finally came and it was delicious. Great texture of fettucine and nice sauce. The waiter was never to be seen again, not even when our waters were empty and we were dying of thirst. Then he came back with our seperate bills and as my first friend paid with her credit card, I handed him a $20 for a $16 bill. He snatched it rudely and fast out of my hand with two fingers (my friend is a eye witness of this ridiculousness) and then he slammed it on the table as my other friend proceeded to pay his bill with his card... No 'thank you' or 'do you want change for this'.. he finishes the transactions and rushes away with a 'have a good night' ... does that mean I don't get change? Dude, I was going to barely tip you the 10-15% but apparently you decided to keep 20% for yourself without asking..?!?! I'm pretty sure many restaurants train you to ask if the customer wants change even if they gave you barely over the price they have to pay... WTF? Ridiculous. So, thank you STEVEN, who works on sunday night for your awesome behaviour! I will NEVER return to this location again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always busy! We came on a random week night and still had to wait a bit (20 min) for a table!   I had a better experience with my food this time around though I feel our waiter was kind of new. He forgot my husband's wine and our waters a couple of times and seemed a bit frazzled at how busy it was.   Whole reason why I bothered to write an update? The tiramisu! Sooo good. They're like 3 heavenly mounds of deliciousness! I want to go back for more ;P"}
{"text":"WOW, I came here at 8:30 and it was still a packed house with people waiting as well. We were greeted within a reasonable time, I say reasonable as it was a packed house and everyone was running around getting things done. We were informed that it would be a 5 minute wait, we were standing in front of the bar and the bartender asked if we wanted anything to drink and when we said \"no\" he then asked if we wanted some water while we waited. Perfect. This is the way it should be. I should not have to wait until I'm sitting down to get a water.   The instant I walked into this establishment, I noticed that it was very warm and friendly. There seems to be a lot of regulars that come in and the staff know them and act like they're family. It's a great feeling to be in an environment like that. Our server was great and friendly and just a big jolly kind of guy.   Service wasn't spectacular but it wasn't terrible. It was extremely busy and there were a couple of large parties there. Our server was friendly and was knowledgeable and didn't do the disappearing act, but I suppose he didn't check in often enough for my liking but seriously, I didn't really notice.   Now the good stuff, the food! It was amazing! I had the torino which is agnolotti pasta stuffed with ricotta and spinach in a creamy tomato sauce. But what the menu doesn't say is that the creamy tomato sauce has onions, tomatoes and pancetta in it! It enhances the taste so much! My s.o. had the eligio pizza and when it came to the table it looked as though the crust on the pizza was too thick but it turned out to be the perfect thickness.   Before our meal came, they gave us some bread. It turned out to be sourdough bread and it was perfect, it wasn't piping hot but it was the perfect temperature. The crust was crispy enough without being crunchy and the middle was soft and fluffy. I can't say how good my pasta dish was. It was exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted. It was the perfect portion and tasted so good.   I didn't get a chance to have dessert but honestly I definitely think I'll be back again and will eventually be able to try it. The service might have been a little less than what I expect but the food more than made up for that fact. There is a closer location to where I live and will probably frequent that one more regularly but this place definitely has my business from now on."}
{"text":"Despite its somewhat shabby appearance, Grazie's has a great selection of pastas, pizzas and drinks. I especially enjoyed the Milano - very creamy and filling! The linguine was cooked perfectly al dente. For dessert, we had tiramisu. Tiramisu was a bit lacklustre compared to others but still really good. If you're a big fan of Italian cuisine and want variety, come to Grazie's! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely the most overrated Italian restaurant in town! A basic past joint with very mediocre food, long lines, and high prices. If you craving Italian in this area head a dew doors north to one of the smaller places. You'll get way better food in a nicer atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we had the worst experience ever. This has nothing to do with the service-- our server  was great!! Fantastic service from our server and the other staff who made sure my water glass was never empty and timed our food to come out at just the right time.  We had three items from the menu-- baked brie in phyllo pastry (tasty but not enough greens in our opinion, since it is listed as a salad), the Nico pasta dish and the Bosco.   Our troubles all started with the Bosco dish. My friend is health conscious, so he asked for \"No extra salt please\". Brie starter came and went, fine, then came the mains. I had the Nico and was quite happy with it. It was exactly what I wanted-- the perfect blend of beefiness, mushrooms and sauce. I was very pleased with it. My friend, on the other hand, was unhappy with the Bosco but wasn't going to say anything. We both agreed it tasted like nothing more than butter on noodles with some mushrooms thrown in. I personally think that if I like a restaurant, then I owe it to them to tell them when something isn't quite right, rather than go home, sulk about it, then never go back (which most people do). I flagged down the waiter and told him that we both didn't like my friend's dish. BIG MISTAKE. I wish we'd just paid and left and never gone back.  The server was very accommodating and kind. He asked us what he could do to fix it. We asked for the menu back to choose something different, and he took away the offending Bosco. While we were deliberating, a man that we can only assume is the owner or manager came over and tried to forcefully talk to us into realizing that it is our own fault for not liking the dish, since surely it was because my friend had asked for no extra salt. \"No, I'm not blaming you, it's just that I have to justify my kitchen\" (in other words, he was absolutely blaming us for not liking the dish). Even though we felt the salt level was appropriate, somehow it was supposedly our fault that we didn't like the Bosco dish. He explained that there is no reason the sauce should taste like butter, since they use 35% cream in the sauce (in other words, whipping cream. The same cream used to make butter).   For the record, let me point out that once, I had 35% cream in my own fridge, which I left there half empty and forgot about. After a week or two-- it turned very buttery looking. I'm wondering if this is just a case of the cream being left out for too long, hence the buttery taste.  Coincidentally, my friend later reported that he was very nauseous and vomited through the night. I am wondering if there is a connection.  We found the interaction with the manager/owner very upsetting. If you ever find yourself there and don't like the food-- just fake a previous sporting injury flare up and LEAVE STAT (then eat somewhere else instead-- don't look back)."}
{"text":"Good food but has nothing on Terroni."}
{"text":"I went to Grazie because my friend had highly recommended it to me. I have no complains regarding the food. I order a pasta, Amalia and it was amazing. The food, menu and atmosphere was great. However, I do have a complain regarding the server. Me and my friends went to the restaurant yesterday June 26 to celebrate our graduation. And some of us arrived early while the others were running late. We decided to wait for them to order so that we could all eat together and celebrate. But our friends were later than they informed us and we were starving by that point because we haven't had any food for the whole day. So we decided to order before our friends arrive. The server was very rude and threatened to move us to a smaller table. The restaurant wasn't even busy at that time and there were many tables for big or small groups available. Instead of listening to us he just decided that if we wanted to order we would have to move to a smaller table and that's it. He started to take away our menus and was ready to kick us out of our table.His tone was also very unpleasant. Me and my friend were very surprised and didn't know what to do so we said we would wait for our friends.  Later he tried to be nice to us but what he did was so rude that it really ruined the experience for me. I know people have bad days but I think no matter what happened to you, you shouldn't take it out on people.  We were there to celebrate and have a great time and he really ruined it for us. We had no fault or control that our friends were running late. He didn't mentioned that we had to wait for our friends so that we could all order. If so what appetizers even exist for? And we were hungry and excited to try the food!!!! I won't mention his name but he knows it's him. Just know that you really ruined my experience and I hope you get better at your job and treat people better next time. I know the food tasted good but it really didn't matter after the way I was treated. I just felt terrible and upset the whole time. Never going back. Too bad because the food and atmosphere is great. But I rather go to another Italian restaurant in the area because coming back here will only remind me of how bad it was the first time I was here."}
{"text":"Yum, friendly service, delicious food, immense wine selection and reasonably priced.  I usually vary which dish I get, but I've never been disappointed.  Appetizer is usually the baked goat cheese salad (wrapped in phyllo dough) or a pizza.  Must get the carrot cake for dessert!  Bummer that they do not take reservations but the fresh pasta is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great servers, breads are yummy, cocktails are tasty and filling. Pear prosciutto salad had rock hard flavorless pear, minestrone, although good, was not tomato based, but rather almost a chicken broth. Focaccia was tasty but almost pizza like, not a bread style. Good food, just a little different."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fast service. Decent price and good atmosphere. The only reason I give 4 stars is that the service was not overly friendly. Maybe they had a long day? I'll return when I get in the area"}
{"text":"Been to this place for my birthday dinner few months ago and wanted to write a review but completely forgot about it. Luckily, I still remember everything about that night. Had heard really good reviews about this place and thought to try it out on a special day. Unfortunately it was a big fat bummer for us. We had a reserved table for two by the window. It looked like their busy night and server took little longer than expected to get us water. He gave enough time to decide what we wanted and was considering our need to custom make vegetarian pasta for us. They don't have anything special to offer if you let them know your birthday/anniversary.   Anyway Everything was fine until \"The Food\"arrived which was the sole purpose of our visit. It consisted of the wine suggested by the server(too strong for me) free bread (very chewy and hard like a rubber) the Alfredo pasta was so uncooked without flavour. Then came the dessert time and was hoping atleast that will make it up for my birthday dinner. But they were all Sold out.!!!  The staff was well aware of our disappointment and were Sorry about that!! We so wanted to like this place. Will never go back there again after they ruined my birthday dinner. SOB!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 on a busy Saturday. After paying for our drinks from the bar before being seated @ our table, the wait staff appeared a bit rushed to take our order. In fact, while our friends were just digging into their Caesar salads, the staff brought out the mains. The food was quite good and we did manage to monopolize the table regardless of the impatient staff. We ordered a piece of chocolate to go. PS the Cosmo costs $12.00! A bit much for a few sips!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend.    I sat at the bar.  The service was friendly and quick.  The complimentary olive oil and bread was tasty.  I got a pasta dish - the Alessandra - it was very good.  But I was sitting by the kitchen and everything I saw coming out looked delicious.    I was traveling to Toronto for work, but if I was in the area again I would love to come back to Grazie!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Italian food you can get in the GTA. I had the Tasca and it was perfect - my favourite sauce is their creamy tomato, my friend also had the Penza and I'd go back just to have that for myself. Was less of a fan of the Catrina but it'd be good for someone who likes a \"meaty\" pasta."}
{"text":"I have been to Grazie many times,and I have always enjoyed my meal. I really like the \"torino\" pasta. It is so simple,just a tomato cream sauce with spinach and ricotta stuffed ravioli. It is sooo good! The pasta is homemade,and I have also enjoyed the goat cheese salad,and the chicken. Great food. My only feedback would be go at lunch cause its just way too busy at dinner. The tables are tiny and they are packed in tight. They have very generous portion sizes. Don't forget to finish with a cappacino cause they make em right!!!!"}
{"text":"Good vibe and atmosphere. Waiter was attentive and nice. The food was above average. Would have liked more options on the entrees, if you aren't in the mood for pasta, tough place to eat, limited on other things."}
{"text":"Grazie is a popular restaurant in the Yonge & Eglinton area that doesn't need to make reservations in order to bring a crowd of people....as it's always jam packed on evenings.  Bruschetta pizza was a 4! Perfect shareable size for our party of 5. Lots of tomatina and perfectly baked!  Catrina was a solid 4/5: linguini with a mix of onions, grilled chicken and pancetta. Presentation was perfect and the portions are by far decent!  Chocolate brownie cheesecake mmm pure blissful 5. Rich on all scale of flavors.  The prices are very reasonable as is the quality and its no surprise people keep coming back.  Grazie's overall service was acceptable, and its nice to see the manager being very personable with their clientele whether they're newcomers or regulars."}
{"text":"one of two location locations in the GTA!  Grazie is located by a group of restaurants surrounding Vaughan Mills.  Their original location is situated at Yonge and Eglinton.  Though north of the city this second location is just as busy.  Coming here to meet up with family friends, the restaurant's interior is lovely with its dim and rustic interior its definitely cozy and bustling during peak dinner hours.  Like the other location, Grazie does NOT take reservations, so wait times can vary, fortunately for us it was only a 15-20 time wait.     My meal started off with their house made Caesar salad which was quite good.  For mains, accompanying our glass of red, I ordered their Penza cooked in a creamy tomato sauce tossed with some greens and pancetta (Italian bacon)  I ended off my meal with an espresso  Overall the place is okay...."}
{"text":"I have tried so many italian restaurants but honestly, their pastas are soooooooo delicious. I love the yonge and Eglinton location. Just dont take anyone on ur first date, sits are too close together. Hahahaah."}
{"text":"We arrived one cold December evening for a gathering of friends for our annual Christmas dinner.  We had made prior reservations for party of 14 and were told that we need half of the party there by our reserved time to claim our table.  We all arrived on time to a restaurant that was barely full than half.  I guess reservations were not totally necessary after all?   I am by no means an expert on Italian food.  My knowledge of Italian food doesn't go beyond spaghetti and pizza!   I've been to Grazie's Yonge & Eglinton location previously and I enjoyed the freshly made pasta I had that evening. I was expecting the same here.  Our waiter was very friendly and inviting, he promptly took our drink orders and was able to answer all the questions we had about the specials that evening.    I actually ended up ordering one of the specials, a seafood pasta made with spicy tomato sauce.   When it arrived, I noticed there were a lot of mussels, squid rings, shrimp and clams swimming in tomato sauce.  It looked delish.  Taste though, was not what I expected. The sauce was great, seasoned perfectly with a balance between hot and sweet.  However, not all of the ingredients were fresh. The squid, mussels and shrimps tasted dry. Like it was re-heated from the day before. The squid rings reminded me of the ones you get that are frozen from the market.  The pasta was a bit overcooked.  The sauce was the only redeeming quality.    Then it struck me, specials are often left over ingredients that the restaurant couldn't clear for whatever reason.  It would explain why despite having a positive experience with the food at their Yonge & Eglinton location, that I am having an average plate of seafood pasta right now at this location.    Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.    However, I would advise future diners to stay away from their specials, and hopefully, their main food offerings would be better cooked.  I would revisit Grazie, just not at this location for now."}
{"text":"I feel so sick!!! I had a pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella, and it was suppose to be pepperoni, but it was gross pepperoni that I think has now made me sick.  I hope to feel better soon. But it's already been 2 hours since I ate and it's just getting worse. I don't know it is was the canned flavoured non-Italian sauce or the weird pepperoni?"}
{"text":"I had been to Grazie twice before with my boyfriend and it had become my favourite Italian restaurant. So we went for my birthday last week and once again it did not disappoint. The food was of course amazing - I ordered the Basta (shrimp linguine in cream sauce) for the first time and it is now my new favourite. However the experience was heightened by a singular person who went out of his way to make all of us feel special and comfortable. His name is Carlos. Not Tyler (what my future mother in law accidentally though his name was), Carlos! Though every one who works here is professional and friendly, Carlos the beautiful Brazilian is a real gem. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and have been here a few times.  Food - tasteful and presented well on each of my visits.  I love it!  Decor - simple and tasteful but it is always packed.  Service - quality service on each visit.  Price - in line with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for few times already and the food never disappoint.  My suggestion is, try to make reservation to avoid the waiting time! Few days ago I went here with my cousin and had 3 dishes: - steamed mussels on white wine sauce - penza (rigatoni in creamy tomato sauce) - catrina (spinach linguini in garlic sauce)  The service was good, food was amazing (I would say the best pasta in Toronto!). Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"Well. My family used to go here quite a bit when it first opened. It is supposed to be a good Italian restaurant but for some reason, I've never really took to a liking of this place. I mean, the food is decent but not spectacular. We would usually get a couple appetizers to share (calamari most of the time) and a couple of pizza's to split between everyone who was there. The pizza's are not bad at all and are probably the best thing there that I like. However, the pasta's are nothing special. They are kind of like Olive Garden Pasta. Where you know what you're getting. The deserts are also good but they aren't spectacular. I've had better tiramisu and more places than Grazie's.   The wait staff is very friendly but the layout of the restaurant is really bad and needs to be improved. You walk in and there is not a lot of standing room. There are 2 dining areas to your right and left and a small bar with 2 walls in the middle. So if the restaurant is packed (which is usually is on a weekend night) then you'll end up having to wait outside. Doing this in the winter sucks. You can stand at the bar but they have at most 10 seats there and there is a wall less than a meter from the bar stools so there isn't much room to stand around if you want to grab a drink while you wait. Plus, the wait staff has to walk through this area to get to the other side of the restaurant.  The prices of the food aren't too bad. If you're gonna get some wine with the food, then you'll be paying more of course. On a quality vs price basis, I'd say it's pretty close to even with price maybe coming out a bit more but that's my own personal opinion. My family doesn't really like to go here anymore as we know better places to hit up in the city.  The type of atmosphere that they have at Grazie's is the kind of place you'd take a girl on a first date to to impress her. However, I know many more places in Toronto that are better. Overall, I try and avoid Grazie's but there is always someone who likes it and wants to go back there so I end up going there and coming out a little disappointed each time."}
{"text":"My gf and I went for a early dinner. She is not a big fan of pasta or pizza or dessert. Red wine, of course.  Jack(bear) suggested the pizza with salad/olives/tuna on it. I of course had Penza pasta.  Not only did she love the pizza, she loved my Penza. Shock!  We ordered the creme bru cheese cake which was awesome.  Perfect meal (as always), great service (Jack) and great price!  No question, best Italian restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been to this red before - but it was many years ago.  It was great then and it's still great now!  Went to dinner a few weeks ago and had the seafood pasta special, my friend had the steak special that day.  The seafood pasta was light and creamy and quite good.  The steak was delicious- it came with a spicy mango chutney which was a fabulous kick to the steak.  This is quite a large restaurant but it does get busy so I would definitely make reservations on the weekend.  The servers are all friendly and gracious.  I've yet to have a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Decent, convenient, hearty, oily ... nothing special, but nothing wrong either."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and the staff are nice. This place has a great atmosphere. The food is consistently good. They use fresh pasta for all the primi piatti. They make their own veal demi-glace, which is a real treat. It is a very popular place and sometimes it is hard to get a table or space at the bar.  I had one bad experience of diarrhea from the \"Bosco\" field mushroom pasta, so you might want to avoid that one. Probably a one-off. It won't stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"My family's go-to restaurant for special occasions. We love this restaurant. The food and drinks are great. Service is amazing. We always look forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"Grazie was good food; I think slightly overpriced.  Very very noisy.  Otherwise I'm not a big enough fan of Italian that this place would convince me I want to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, beautiful decor, wide variety of delicious food, good prices. How can you go wrong... great place for a friends/family night out or for a date... will definitely be returning to try the other dinner items.  :)"}
{"text":"Great spot to come for a nice Italian meal.  Very very reasonable price wise and great value to boot.   Make sure you get here early or you will be stuck waiting as this yonge and eg joint gets bustling.    The goat cheese salad is unique and delicious.   All the food is fresh and delicious.  I would recommend the pastas.    Desserts are a specialty and the tiramisu is one of the best I have had the chance to enjoy.    Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If i came to grazie before having a taste of tappo and paganelli's, it couldve been one of the best pasta ive ever had. pasta is not plain or boring or bland here. but still, i know better now and it is not the best nor authentic ive ever had. Grazie is now my middleground of italian food. anywhere better than Grazie is amazing. anything less than Grazie.. well, i'd skip it.   be prepared to wait to be seated ! we had to wait for about a little over half an hr for dinner on a weekday evening.   i shared a calamari as an app with my DC and penza as my main. i forget what my DC had but it doesnt matter, i was too busy trying to decide if i really like my dish or not that i forgot to try a bite of his.   like any other italian place, they brought bread & olive oil & balsamic vinegar . bread was kind of chewy, but not bad chewy, good chewy, if that makes any sense. i really liked the balsamic vinegar they had here. not too vinegary.   calamari app was one of the specials of the day and it was HUGE. it came with a dipping sauce and a little side salad. salad did NOT look too fresh. :( dipping sauce was just meh. calamari itself was pretty good, not too greasy, not too much batter, not too chewy.. BUT it had some fishy smell to it. not too much, but just enough to be noticeable.  my main penza... pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. the creamy tomato sauce and bacon went really well together, however, the taste of bacon overwhelmed the sauce. i guess thats not necessarily a bad thing.. who doesnt like bacon, right?"}
{"text":"My parents were in town and I wanted to take them out for dinner somewhere they'd enjoy but wouldn't break the bank. We took them to Grazi, and I was happy we did. We've always gone there when we felt like a nice Italian meal, but the service was even better than I remembered. The food was great, and the waiter gave us very good recommendations when asked. The service was pleasant and quick. We told the waiter we were trying to make a movie, and he made sure we got everything as soon as we could. Best value for money in the city."}
{"text":"One of the best pasta place in Toronto! I went here for lunch with my family and I felt extremely satisfied with their service and food. When I first walked in I saw another family where one person was in a wheelchair. I was super impressed with how the server paid attention to that person and made sure to check in with everyone else (very heartwarming) :)   I had the Capri pasta (linguine with shrimp and clams) and it was a good sized portion for the price. Best of all, the atmosphere was casual. From a restaurant like this where you would assume it to be business casual wear, it was actually very casual. Food came promptly and is a place I would definitely recommend. It truely lives up to its hype!"}
{"text":"This place has won me over and it may be because it is deeply rooted in my childhood memories. As a young lad playing baseball my team was sponsored by Grazie Ristorante and my third base coach was the owner. But either way it's still a great place to eat and has some of the best pizzas in town.  This place is absolutely hopping! I came here at a time that should be way beyond the dinner rush and I still waited 20mins, it felt almost as if I was waiting to eat in New York. So my suggestion is to try and snag a reservation if you wanna eat a little earlier. Luckily for me I wasn't pressed for time and had the luxury of sitting back and taking in the sights and sounds.  Service is amazing as the servers are very attentive and charming in that Italian, no need to be so formal, kind of way. They are also ninjas as they were always around without knowing. As soon as I was about to perk up my head to look and ask for something the server was already there asking me what I needed. I think if I dropped a napkin, they would catch it and lay it across my lap before it touched the floor.  The pizza is crispy, slightly chewy, thin, and has a perfect balance of sauce to cheese. The only thing holding this pizza back is the lack of a flavorful crust. For some odd reason the crust just seems dull. That being said this place holds a solid spot in the top 5 places to have a pie. Deelicious! The pastas here are also very good and the sauce to pasta balance is great, not too much, not too little.  Overall, I say it is definitely worth the trek to Grazie as the prices are not bad and the food is great. Definitely more bang for your buck at this joint. If it is more than two of you definitely ring for a reservation before showing up or you may look forward to waiting quite a while. Also the atmosphere is fairly loud with all the people and conversing, so if you're looking for that nice quiet dinner venue you're gonna have to seek refuge elsewhere."}
{"text":"You know when you've been to that one restaurant over and over over 10 years and you \"forget\" to add a review because you almost don't want people to remember how good it is and make it tough for you to get a spot?  It's been 4 years since my last visit and like an old friendship or comfiest couch at your parent's place, it's just as warm, welcoming and worth visiting. This is a place where the classic pizza and pasta dishes are rich, comforting and completely filling, it's a place to order the specials because they truly are that. It's also the place where you get a decent wine list but get to gripe about their sad selection of Single Malt or Bourbon (better keep your promise to rectify that for next visit )  The entire neighbourhood changed around you in the last decade, but I'm so glad you guys are still serving up some great Italian food!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, well-priced, simple Italian fare. The restaurant always fills up with a friendly, vibrant crowd. I love the crust of  the pizza and I really can say it's one of the best that I ever tried, awesome, the salad and pastas are fab."}
{"text":"Very good location. Food was above average. Italian family style. Some of the servers were inexperienced, but the overall service was well presented."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were told it would be a twenty minute wait. After an hour and seeing many other groups of the same size getting in ahead of us, who came after us, we decided it was unreasonable that they told us that it was going to be a twenty minute wait and left. in addition to the ridiculous wait, they squished everyone in who was waiting like they were herding cattle, which was 100% a fire hazard. they were dismissive when dealing with our inquiries regarding the wait time and overall the experience wasn't worth the overpriced wine we had while waiting. do yourself a favour and walk down the street to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food service and atmosphere. Always busy but the food is always perfect.  Great great place for lunch or dinner at Yonge and Eg.."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! We were there last night (sunday night) quick friendly service, good recommendation and info on their menu items. Please see the pics so you know what to expect.  We had :  - Branca Salad , really good! - Backed Goat cheese salad, this is sooo delicious ! - Bologna Pasta : my favorit , v.good portion, well done! - Penza pasta: highly recommended! And the crown goes to the Dolce: Flourless Chocolate torte, this is top of the top! You really would like to kiss the cook after this!  I highly recommend this place for birthdays, family dinner, a date, or a biz lunch! Thanks to the wonderful waiters, with patience, memory, thoughtfulness,  and funny friendly smile."}
{"text":"I've been going to Grazie for over 10 years!  My favorite dish throughout this entire time has been the Bruchetta (not to be confused with Bruchetta Pizza) and Assisi (Fettucine with a variety of mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.)  Seriously, 9 out of 10 times I go, I'd order these 2 items.  I hate the fact that its always so busy so I avoid going on the weekends and tend to go on a Tuesday or Wednesday night.  They also have really good pizzas that I order when I am not in the mood for pasta."}
{"text":"In town last weekend to visit family and wanted to go to Absolute Comedy and found this just up the street. Jessica, our server and the food runners were wonderful. They made our dinner experience much better. The Capri and the pizza (forgot what it is called) with sausages and pepperoni were wonderful. I finished my pasta in no time which does not happen too often. I don't like tomato sauce or cream sauce, so this white wine sauce on the pasta was just perfect. Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"When I go to an Italian restaurant, my biggest issue is ordering between Pizza and Pasta. My pasta dish was really good, but everything else was meh.   We walked in and were seated by the door, odd. There was no one else in the restaurant. The server brought over bread and butter (the bread was rock hard). We ordered our drinks, and decided to go for the Caesar salad and the Nato Pizza (pepperoni, peppers, and mushrooms. The salad was basic with huge leaves of lettuce (annoying) and home-made croutons - no bacon :(   The pizza was ok, the dough was good but the toppings were not cooked and overall was a very average tasting pizza. We had all ordered pasta as our mains. I thought mine was the best. The Penza was Rigatoni with vodka, spicy pancetta (cured bacon), green onions & a touch of chili pepper. It was all cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.   I thought the Creamy tomato sauce was good (it could have used more salt). Usually creamy sauce gets very heavy and tomato sauce can get kind of boring but this was great. The pasta was a bit undercooked which was annoying. The spicy pancetta was great, added a good texture to the dish.   Overall I would go back if I was in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"First time I've tried this place was when we had a corporate dinner near Christmas time.  The second time I went here was dinner with a group of friends during the summer.  The third time was with a friend just before winter.  All three occasion, the service was good and the meal was enjoyable.    I wouldn't know the authenticity of the place, but I give it 5 stars because of it's consistency to satisfy me and everyone I go to dinner with, regardless of when and how many there are in the party.  The service and the taste of food is always on point.  It doesn't matter what type of pasta or pizza, everyone is always happy at the end of the meal.  Just the fact that there was something I can agree on with the people I work with, that says a lot, don't you think?  On a more serious note, this place will not fail you."}
{"text":"Food is so good!! customer service is even better. Defiantly will be back when I'm in the mood for good Italian and a nice bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, atmosphere, prices.  This place is just awesome.  Moved down the street over 2 years ago.  Go there fairly often.  Never had a bad experience!  Wait could be long on hot summer nights, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighbourhood Italian restaurant! We started with the bruschetta pizza, which was very fresh but admittedly I wouldn't order this again because it was a bit too doughy. The bf had the Nico, which was amaze-balls, and I had the Catrina, which was equally delectable. Can't wait to go back for another Italian indulgence!"}
{"text":"3.5*** great pasta selection. The place is always busy until very late and the atmosphere is lively. The pastas are generally delicious but are not huge and do not come with salad or any side dish despite being ~$15 a plate. The salads are way overpriced not to mention they charge $6-7 more for adding chicken....and it's still tiny. Still it's a nice place to go for pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick but cute Valentine's Day dinner (I say quick because I wanted to catch the all-star game.. so I wanted to eat, get back into sweats, and watch the game!!!   Waited for 20 mins to get a table no problem grabbed a drink by the bar and we chatted with the friendly bartender.   When we sat down, our waiter came over and offered to read the specials of the night. we both ordered the special soup- potato,brie and bacon soup and it was sooo good.   I ordered the Penza pasta added chicken and it was flavourful and creamy. My bf had the pizza and it looked really good, he said the crust was perfect and the toppings were very flavourful.   knocking off 1 point because of the music.... it was a little loud and too euro.. it would have been nice to listen to some smooth jazz or something a little soft."}
{"text":"Pasta dish was really good.   We waited in line for 15 mins then eventually got a seat.   Overall it was a good experience, would go back again."}
{"text":"Best pasta I've had in a while! I loved their pasta menu (separated by creaminess of sauce) and opted for a creamy tomato sauce Odessa pasta. It was a good sized portion for the price, and definitely left me satisfied.  I was also super impressed by the service here. All the waiters were beaming as if working for Grazie was the best job in the world. The table next to us had a birthday celebration going on, and a group of servers hopped in to sing a gleeful happy birthday. They helped brighten the atmosphere and make our meal more enjoyable.   We came for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and it was quite busy, though we got a table within five minutes. The decor is lovely with colourful paintings covering the walls. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yesterday, was the second time I visited Grazie in the last four years. The first time, I had such a positive experience that I was looking for a reason to return. Therefore, it came to mind when a few family friends and I were looking for a place to dine.  One of them eluded to how noise is positively correlated to how well the business does and this place fits into that category. The combination of hard floors and a menu that aims to meet the tastes of every age group causes the volume to rise as the place gets busier. You see everything from young families to octogenarian couples all looking for a fancy but casual Italian meal.  Aside from the noise, the atmosphere is very inviting and encourages patrons to enjoy themselves. Staff are attentive (if almost to a fault) and know their menu well. Price point is very reasonable for the amount of food you receive and considering that everything is made 'al minute'.  I think the low point of the meal for me was the bread that they brought out at the start of the meal. It was cold and not cut all the way through. However, this was a minor point in what was otherwise a fantastic meal.  I had one of their oil and garlic dressed pasta dishes (with spinach, grilled chicken, and a ricotta pesto), it was delicious! The meat was tender and juicy and the ingredients created a sauce of their own. My dinner companions both ordered pizza and were both very happy with their selection. I must admit, I did try a piece of the pizza and the crust tasted like a freshly baked loaf of bread that had just come out of the oven. I can see why this place does well!  I decided to splurge for dessert and was ordered their berry pastry. It was not overly sweet and was covered in all types of berries. It was certainly gentle on the palatte, making one savour every bite.  Overall, this place is a solid four stars. This is not the place to go if you are hoping to have a quiet conversation with your friends, it is loud. But otherwise, the experience was positive and it remains on my list of decent, reasonably priced Italian restaurants in the Yonge/Eglinton area."}
{"text":"We were here tonight for dinner with a bunch of work colleagues, we're pleasantly surprised at the menu and all of the different choices.    We each ordered a different kind of pasta that all came out quickly and perfectly cooked. The noodles taste as though they were homemade.    The servers were all quick and courteous, and the host sar us immediately when we walked in the door.    The restaurants decor reminds me of Italy, has a lot of authentic pieces and paintings.  Lots of room to seat large parties as well as an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Italian food, I always go to Grazie Ristorante because not only are they nearby, they have so many different kinds of fresh pastas and pizzas to choose from. I like this location because there's always space and I never have to wait for a seat.  Once seated, they start you off with a basket of bread (pretty hard so be careful) and a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The only pizza I've tried from their menu is 'Giovanni' which contains tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, spicy sausage, red onion and hot peppers ($16). The pizza comes out very fresh and I really like the thinness of their crust. One pizza can be shared among 2-3 people if you're also getting a pasta.   For their pastas, I highly recommend 'Penza', rigatoni with vodka, spicy pancetta, green onions & chili pepper ($16.50); 'Catrina', spinach linguine with grilled chicken, spicy pancetta, diced onions & black peppercorn ($16.50); and 'Capri', linguine with shrimp, clams & diced tomatoes ($17). All the pastas I've tried are very delicious but the only thing I would adjust is the amount of salt they put in the sauce, especially for the dishes that contain pancetta since that itself is salty. But aside from the saltiness, I do recommend Grazie because their dishes are fairly priced and you will definitely fulfill your pasta cravings."}
{"text":"Stopped into my favourite Italian restaurant today. I ordered a beautifully constructed pizza with creamy mushroom sauce topped with arugula and prosciutto.   The service was excellent despite it being busy.   Had a really enjoyable meal and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"i always get anything from their agleo e olio section, my husband loves the capri. plain, simple, beautiful stuff! the creamy BASTA is super delicious as well"}
{"text":"I love how their menu separate pasta with cheese and without cheese. For people like me don't like cheese, I just need go straight to the tomato sauces part and to pick.   I really like their pasta, because everything just taste exactly like what I imaged. No surprise, safe taste! Love it!"}
{"text":"I never quite took to Italian food ...enough to rave about a place........but this place is different. Been a few times and I like it very much. I had their rich tomato sauce ravioli and it was really good. Nice ambience too."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars, and service was 3 stars so 3.5 stars overall.  Food: We had the Nico and the Putanesca. The Nico is pappardelle with saut√©ed veal, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes in a stock reduction finished w/ cream. Sounds good? It is good. Not over salted and the only quibble is the pasta wasn't al dente. It wasn't mushy or over cooked, but could've used a minute less cooking.  The Putanesca was full of strong flavors, but not as hot as versions we've had at other places. This is an approachable version that could easy be more salty than it is considering the ingredients. Tart, tangy and bold.  We finished w/ some cappuccinos and split a tiramisu. The cappuccinos were well made, but the tiramisu was about average.  Service: this place is busy and we were told to expect a 25 min. wait for a table. We snagged a couple stools at the bar and sat about 10 mins, watching the hockey game and waiting to be noticed by the bartender before giving up on that strategy and waving him over. Once we told him we'd be dining at the bar, he gave us menus, took our orders, served us and bused our plates. He's the bartender so service was friendly, but not as attentive as table service probably would've been.  tl;dr - we'll be back when we're in the neighborhood. The food's solid and it's a good neighborhood place."}
{"text":"It has been years since we have been to this location, but glad to see the quality of food is still great! They have a large selection of pizzas and pastas. We went with a large group on a Friday night and our table was available on time and we had great service. Food came put promptly and delicious. We shared some mussels and salad to start and for the mains we got the Capri (linguine with shrimps and clams) and Penza (rigatoni with spicy panchetta in a creamy tomato sauce). Enjoyed everything especially the Penza!"}
{"text":"O M G! Boy my meal was delicious! I came with an empty stomach and I left in joy and very full. They gave bread with the option of butter or Olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette, a classic combo to start off this great meal. I ordered the Basta dish, a creamy pasta sauce with spinach noodles and shrimp. I loved it, i'm definitely coming back to have this dish again. The only reason they are getting 4 stars is because I had to ask for water and they didn't ask if I enjoyed my meal. But I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a good ol' dish of new-world pasta in a non-pretentious setting. Grazie is (almost) that place.  I'd agreed to meet my husband and uncle at Grazie at 7:00 on a Wednesday. We were all coming from different parts of town, and I arrived first, about 25 minutes before 7. I figured I'd get a table, order a glass of wine and read for a bit while I waited. When I walked in and asked for a table of 3, I was asked where the rest of my part was. When I explained the situation, I was told rather rudely by the gentleman that he'd be more than happy to put my name on a waiting list for a table...as soon as the rest of my party arrived. There was no way I was getting a table without everyone being present. This was off-putting, and frankly unreasonable to expect everyone to arrive at exactly the same time. The restaurant was busy, yes, but there were tables free and no line from what I can see. So I walked out and sat in Starbucks to read my book while I waited for the others. At 7, I joined my uncle and we asked for a table. Again, we were asked where the third was, and I explained he was stuck in traffic and we would order without him and only then were we given a table (but rather reluctantly).   The food is good. We shared a Romana pizza, which was a delicious mix of thin-sliced potatoes, rosemary and perfectly cooked pancetta. The crust was perfectly crispy. I had the Penza pasta which was ok - the sauce was delicious, but the pancetta got lost in its soupiness. My husband had the Catrina, which he found strange (again, somewhat soupy), and my uncle had the Odessa, which he really enjoyed.   Honestly, I get this restauarant is busy. The food is good, yes, but it's really not the hottest spot in town, and bad attitudes will always overshadow good food."}
{"text":"Great pasta and amazing service. They have a long menu and everything I've tried has been great. There can be long lines for dinner even late at night."}
{"text":"I've been living in the Yonge and Eglinton area for several months now and I've been meaning to try Grazie since it's been around for over 20 years.  We started with their Bruschetta, which arrived with several pieces of crusty bread and the tomato topping presented on the side. It was fairly tasty, though nothing special. The complimentary bread was actually much better; fresh and warm, it was quite delicious.  I was tempted to try one of their many pastas, but I was in a pizza mood so I chose to go with the Giovanni (tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian sausage, red onion, and hot peppers). The pizza was hot and fresh when it arrived, and the toppings all complemented each other perfectly. The crust was perhaps not the best I've ever had, but that's a minor quibble.  I finished with the Cr√®me Brulee Cheesecake. The cr√®me bruelee part was hard to notice - it wasn't crispy in the slightest - but the cheesecake was good.  All in all, I would describe Grazie as a safe, run-of-the-mill Italian restaurant that doesn't quite knock it out of the park but is dependable and tasty.  (I should note, finally, that it took a really long time to get the bill. We kept looking around for our waitress but she was nowhere in sight for a long while. Smoke break, perhaps?)"}
{"text":"I'm a bit struggled to write this review. There is really not much to share.   We ordered Napoletana & Brunello.   The pasta from both dishes are over cooked. Tasted like Chinese stir fry noodle. (I guess due to the high reviews, we were expecting more of \"Italian\" al dente pasta..)  The service, sigh.. the restaurant was 40% empty when we arrived, (with most customers seated by the window so it appeared to be packed from outside view). Several servers saw us and walked pass by, with no words or eye contact. We waited for 10 min or so, self served to the barstools by the door, until someone ask \"would you like a window seat. Of course we said \"no, bar is fine\"  Overall experience is .. bad.. not worst, just bad.   On the side note, their bruschetta is worth a try. The only good experience we had."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I've been coming here for years. I always have a good meal.  I usually always have the same dishes too.  We share a Giovanni pizza to start,  really nice light crust and very tasty.  The sausage and onions etc really go well together.   Afterwards I have a Penza pasta.  It's delicious.  It is very similar to a amatriciana that you might elsewhere.  To wrap it up have a nice piece of chocolate cake,  they have an excellent example.  The servers are all really very good.  So give this place a try.   I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I love to eat here. Pizza here is so fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. Service is fast and feels unhurried."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in the city! Food is to die for... their pastas are so flavourful, it makes me want to cry! Generous portions at reasonable prices. Service is always the best, they're very accommodating, friendly and professional. Atmosphere is cozy, yet buzzing. Always worth the small wait for a table! A must try!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would....  The food was good... The customer service was HORRIBLE!!!!! The manager is such an asshole. I am a vegetarian and I ordered a pasta without chicken and he refused to adjust my bill. When he came to my table... He had the balls to tell me that if he customized it and did everything separate it would cost more. How does a pasta without chicken cost more?? This is the first time ever that a manager has not adjusted my bill. And it says right at the bottom of their menu that they accommodate. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Went to Grazie last night to finally try them out for the first time. I used to live near the Yonge and Eglinton location but everytime I tried to go it was always super busy and had a long wait to get in.  The ambiance is just ok... feel they could have done a better job here. Also serving the butter packets with the bread kinda cheapened the experience but they also gave this dip (balsamic, spicy oil & parmesan cheese) which was very tasty for the bread!  The wine list was very reasonable with some great options at reasonable prices.  I ordered the Baked Goat Cheese salad ($12) to start which was super tasty and something I would definitely reccomend. Basically it is goat cheese wrapped in phylo pastry served on a bed of greens w/ tomatoes on the side. A good sized portion! For my main I had the Nonna Franca pasta ($14.50) which at first I felt was just okay, but as I kept eating it and getting more of the flavour in there it was quite delicious! I really liked the sweet/savoury combo in this pasta.  All in all my meal came to $80 after tax, tip, a 1/2 litre of wine and a caffe latte and I think it was worth it.    All in all I would say it is probably a 3.5/5 for the category it is in and definitely worth trying. I just wish they had a caprese salad on the menu, though the goat cheese was quite awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here...the food is tasteless. I ordered a Cesar salad only to send it back...Kraft has a better salad dressing. Also I was served water that had a oily film on the top. My mom asked for extra garlic for her pasta and that wasn't provided either. Will not be back...worst food I've ever had"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 5 years ago. I had a bad experience in general. Food taste real bad. And service sucked. But I decided to try one more time b/c I thought it's been 5 years so... I went to this please yesterday with my gf. We waited 30mins to get seated b/c there were so many people. We got sorted after 30mins. I asked for water with no ice b/c the weather was extremely cold. We ordered salad and pizza b/c they were Italian restaurant so..... Food came. My gf liked salad but the pizza was bad. The moment I lifted l all the toppings dropped. Even the girl next table saw it and kinda smile/laughed. I tried anyway.... Tasted so bad. We could've finished the whole pizza. (I thought Costco pizza tasted way better) I mean I just don't understand why so many people come to that place..... I guess it's location location location. ( I can't believe I just wrote all this....) don't take ur family or gf there.. I highly don't recommend."}
{"text":"Came as a group recently and ordered the Nico. Had good portions of meat (slightly overcooked and tough) with mushroom juice over a thick pasta. In my opinion I found this dish to be very similar to standard Chinese food as silly as it sounds. The Nico was under the white sauce category but it what came out was something alot more on the brown - soy sauce salty base. I'd try something else on the menu next time. But the price is steep 25 dollars after tax and tips.   The portions are fair and the service was decent. But I would be more inclined to try a different pasta place"}
{"text":"I've been to Grazie a couple of times now. Most recently on a Saturday night. At the end of the meal, the server commented that it was the quietest he's ever seen it on a Saturday and it was still relatively busy at that time. When we first arrived (at around 6 pm), we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. It was very crowded around the entrance, but it ended up being a much shorter wait.   I would probably make a reservation in future to avoid any wait time, but they only do reservations at non-peak hours. The restaurant is family friendly and can get kind of noisy.  I ordered the Bologna pasta, which was very good. It seemed a relatively small size compared to everyone else's huge pizzas, but it was filling. Our server was very animated and friendly. All of the staff there have been very courteous in my experience.   The location is convenient for the Yonge and Eg crowd, with good food, and pleasant service. A solid 4 stars, but not my favourite Italian in the city."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  We want to Grazie for our company Christmas lunch after a recommendation from one of my colleagues. I'm not too familiar with Italian food, but I do love me pizza and pasta!  I won't comment on what my coworkers ordered as they all seemed to enjoy their food regardless. For me, I ordered the Napoletena, which was linguine with tomato sauce, shrimp, and clams.  The linguine was cooked perfectly and I found the shrimp to be very good. The clams, however, had minor sand in them. The tomato sauce was also quite well done, although it felt a little watery at the bottom. The parmesan cheese added to the food was a wonderful attention; gotta love cheese in general!  Service was excellent. We had to wait a good 30 minutes for the full party to show up, but the server was very appreciative and told us to take as long as we need. The restaurant in general was also very accommodating of the fact we had a wheelchair coworker with us.  I was told after there were a lot of great Italian restaurants around the Vaughan Mills area...should come back here more often!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!  Went to the original location at Yonge and Eglinton for years before the vaughan one opened up.   Always had either the Basta or the Milano which are both delicious.  Just recently I tried the Udine and now I go to bed thinking about it.  It was that good.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for the first time. Great family style Italian restaurant with awesome prices and portions. I visited on a Sunday night and the restaurant was quite busy but there wasn't a wait. The restaurant itself is very family style with bright lighting and simple seating.   The pasta and pizza selection is white massive. We ordered two pastas (the Nico and Penza) which were both very tasty, came with generous portions, at a great price.   I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"We were done shopping at Vaughan Mills and Pickle Barrel had an hour wait for a table so we came to Grazie. The service was friendly and pleasant. They started us off with one basket of bread for the table that wasn't even enough for one piece each, but they happily replenished each time we were out. Some of our waters were dirty so that was questionable. I ordered the Brunello and it was very watery instead of being oily... it was pretty bland, thankfully they came around with parmesan and fresh ground pepper. Not sure I would return again just because it wasn't personally worth it for me."}
{"text":"We just loved this place. My husband and I went here to celebrate our friends graduation. The steak was tender and delicious. My husband still talks about it till today. I had the shrimp pasta. It was a wonderfully light dish but the flavours were very powerful. The service was friendly and quick and the space just has a great atmosphere. We are excited to try their pizzas next time we go."}
{"text":"Probably the best food you can get around the neighbour for the price. However since it is so popular the service can get a little slow and food quality is sometimes a miss.  Food is 5/5 service can be worked on."}
{"text":"Come here for a friends birthday and we waited about 30mins for our table which wasn't too bad....it was packed on a Saturday night I ordered the tasca which looked like a giant dumpling filled with meat, spinach and cheese....it was a bit too sour for my liking...my other friends ordered seafood pasta and such and most of then said the food was a bit too salty Oh yea I forgot if u don't want to pay $7 for a ceaser or house salad tell the waiter no to salad because most of my frds and I got conned in getting the salad when we thought it was free when the waiter asked us ceaser or house salad....he didnt even mention it being extra Overall this restaurant didnt really impress me....would I come back again? Maybe but not for a while as there r many other pastas on the menu"}
{"text":"Grazie is a neighbourhood staple at Yonge and Eglinton. I didn't expect to like it - seemed like a big restaurant that just churned out the dishes - but honestly it's pretty good! No reservations, there's almost always a line but it moves extremely quickly. I've never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.   The food is great and very dependable. It's my favourite pizza in the area (and there's a lot of options) - the crust is thin but perfectly chewy, and toppings are good. I went this past Saturday night and the service we got wasn't great (the server didn't come by very often and we had to ask multiple times for our waters to be refilled) but the meal itself was good. Overall a good option in the neighbourhood, will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The food is just OK.  Nothing very special about this place. Friendly staffs and fine service.  Do I come back again? I don't think so..."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Fresh and authentic Italian food. Service is great and their wine list is good too. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place has good Italian food and the bonus is that trey deliver. I ordered a pizza with bocconcini and ham and it was good other than the fact the pizza arrived cold. It was good after I warmed it up. Will order again but will ensure the don't take too long for delivery!"}
{"text":"Pasta lovers rejoice, you will have a lot to choose from here! I've always heard good things about Grazie and was thrilled to finally make my visit. We came on a Friday night and I was pleasantly surprised that we got seated quite quickly. The service was good with water and bread on the house served right away. There is a large menu of pizza and pastas to choose from so everyone can find something they like. I appreciated the fact they seperate out the various types of pasta sauces (tomato, cream, etc). I went with the Nico (parpadelle) and my boyfriend with the Amalia (ravioli). Both pasta dishes were delicious, cooked to the right consistency and had generous portion size. I can't wait to come back to try some more pastas and the very interesting looking tiramisu! 5/5 (:"}
{"text":"Simply overpriced and the wait was long!   If you want better food and more seafood for less price, I recommend going to \"Ferro Bar\" n Cafe near St.Clair W or \"Balsamico\" just down the street between Yonge and Eglinton and Yonge and Davisville!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Italian restaurant. The service is always great and food is delicious! One thing to consider though is that they don't accept reservations so don't go there starving! There's usually a crowd outside and at peak hours the restaurant is packed while guests are waiting outside to be seated.  For this particular visit my husband and I wanted to have something vegetarian. We ordered Giardina pizza and Tasca pasta. The pasta was basically like a lasagna containing ricotta, mushrooms, brie and spinach baked in tomato sauce. It tasted delicious! The portion size was big and I even had enough leftovers for next day's lunch. The pizza was also very good, the ricotta gave a nice flavor and complemented the other toppings. We also drizzled chili oil on the pizza for a little extra flavour and heat. The food is consistently well cooked, prices are great and service is always awesome! Hands down this place is a clear 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decent Italian place if you like pasta. Very lively environment, but it leads to crowding a little bit. Service was okay. Where the restaurant fell short of my expectations was the pasta--you would think an Italian restaurant would have really good pasta but I found it okay. I would not mind coming back to give it a second try, but definitely not raving about it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a family welcoming Italian food restaurant then this is it. The food is not the best, but if you're craving a bottle of wine with some pasta and not wanting to spend so much then check this place out. Note that there are long lines at peak hours outside so come early :)"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and the place was busy!  The atmosphere is very laid-back, casual, bright... very much a classic Italian family restaurant.   We ordered the fried calamari to start and it was a very large portion, as the price reflects it. The calamari was really crispy and delicious. We were also given some bread and oil/vinegar to start. I didn't like how the oil/vinegar is poured for you.. I had to ask for a bowl of just vinegar (just my preference..). Would have been nice if there were bottles at every table.  I ordered the Penza pasta and it was delicious. The sauce was very flavourful and rich.. there was also a lot of pancetta."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty busy on the weekends, rightfully so. The food is fabulous, the staff is efficient, knowledgeable, and very friendly. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming, and a bit loud.  If you are looking for delicious Italian food, then this is where you need to be. And I know what I'm talking about, I have a Nona-in-law :p"}
{"text":"Loved Grazie!   I don't like how they don't take ressos during the week days but I quickly got past that. I visited this restaurant on a Thursday night with some work friends. Combined, we ordered a bottle of Malbec, two salads, two pasta dishes and bruschetta. I can't recall one complaint being said about the meal or the service. Not one!   Our server was really friendly and gave us some distance at the end of our meal for chatting while we finished our bottle of vino. She didn't over crowd us or give the hairy eyeball to leave when it started to busy-up. I really liked that.   The food was incredible. I ordered the baked goat cheese salad and the Penza pasta. Mmm. Simply Mmm. The goat cheese salad was wrapped with phyllo and had grilled eggplant and peppers inside. It was delightful! The Penza was loaded with pancetta pieces and the green onions really enhanced the flavours. I didn't find my meal too heavy at all which is rare for a creamy pasta dish.  My friend ordered the Tasca pasta dish and thoroughly enjoyed it, too. It came as a surprise when it arrived in a package. Literally arrived in a small, cute, bundled up pasta package. Visually appealing. Another girlfriend has a prosciutto salad with added chicken which looked tasty.   I honestly can't wait to return to Grazie."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant few times and I find every time I am there I feel rushed by the wait staff or one of the managers. Food is okay, I have had better."}
{"text":"After a girls day of shopping at Vaughn Mills, we decided to pop in for dinner at Grazie. Take in mind this place doesn't take reservations so if you don't get in for dinner before 6pm you're going to be waiting for a table.  Usually the wait time is 30min. Luckily we slipped in around 5:50 and we got a table right away.  The staff are really friendly and we had the most entertaining waiter.  He was flirtatious, but he made our stay very fun.  Jokingly insulting us because we wanted separate bills and making comments about us in general.  Good way to gain tips because he was very likable.   2 of my girls ended up with pizza which was a generous size and they book took home a doggie bag.   I ended up with the Tasca pasta -  spinach, mushrooms and brie baked in a surrounding noodle and then smothered in their creamy tomato sauce.  SOOOO good.  Highly recommend!  Prices are reasonable - roughtly $14-16 for your main meal. To end off the night we shared a Tiramasu.  Creamy and very rich.  Just hit the right spot. I left the restaurant full and satisfyed.   Random note - they have a basket of boxed matches for you to take beside the main door. Who gives out matches anymore?...  I stole about 6 boxes.. don't tell anyone :P"}
{"text":"Gracie is a very popular Italian restaurant. The wait for this restaurant is always minimum 30 minutes unless you have supper at 5:30pm. The service is good, staff is friendly and their food is superb. I had the mussels in white wine and it was delicious. I highly recommend their pastas as they are all very good! If you don't like to wait for a spot, this restaurant is not for you because it is ALWAYS busy."}
{"text":"Love this place, I work a few minutes away so I thought I'd try it with some colleagues on lunch - great choice! So fresh, the staff is great and friendly! Will definitely be coming to Grazie regularly! The pizza with soppresata is great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took my 91 year old mother, sister, and brother in law for our farewell dinner before our we returned home to San Francisco. We had a delightful time drinking delicious wine and enjoying salads and pasta and gnocchi and breaded veal cutlet. The ambience is warm and comfortable. The food is good. It was a perfect place to say goodbye to our family."}
{"text":"One of the better traditional Italian foods I've had in my recent memories! Perhaps it was because I was so Asian-out (dim sum, Japanese, Korean non stop for the past week). My husband, brother in law, and I decided to check out Grazie's for weekend lunch. We each ordered a pasta of our choice - bolognese, Torino, and Tazca.   Bolognese - smokey, flavorful meat sauce over perfectly cooked pasta. Traditional dish done well!   Torino - giant al dente agnolotti filled with spinach and ricotta smothered in delectable Vodka cream sauce - out of the world!   Tazca - spinach, mushroom, ricotta, Brie folded within pasta noodle also smothered in vodka sauce - pretty much a yummier version of lasagna! Ate every bits and drops! So so good!   Overall - generous portion, delicious pastas. Will definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Penza is nice! Btw, people working here are nice too, cause they always told my daughter that she is adorable!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre Italian fare. Stay away from the chef specials. I have no idea why people are raving so much about this place. I've lived and worked in the neighbourhood for over 4 years and went there a few times for company gatherings and random dinners. Pasta is OK... Pizza is just OK... To be honest, Spacco just up the street is way better for the flat dough goodness as the venue comes with a few pool tables and a patio"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many time, but never made my way through the front doors until a few nights ago.  I realize that I should have walked through them earlier.  I went on a Monday, and one would think that the place would be dead, but it was packed when I arrived at 7:30pm.  They don't take reservations for dinner, because they obviously don't need to.  When you walk through the door you feel like you've been transported to a local restaurant in Italy.  The staff are very warm, and the manager is your typical flirtatious older Italian man.  Very sweet and it made me feel welcomed and all warm inside ;)  I was on a date, and decided to grab a table before he got there, as it was filling up pretty quickly.  When I mentioned to the person who seated me that it was a first date, they made sure to put us near the back so we could chat and it was more intimate.    Our waiter, much like the manager greeted me with a \"Can I get a beautiful lady something to drink while she waits for her dinner partner\", very sweet and endearing.  Once my date arrived, we decided to order a bottle of wine to split.  Our waiter went through the whole opening and tasting process with us, and we were served in tumbler and not wine glasses just like in Italy.  He was very kind and VERY informed of all of the dishes and specials.  He also suggested what would go well with our wine.  Once our meal arrived, the food was very hot, and very tasty.  We enjoyed the rest of the bottle of wine and our waiter left us alone until the meal was done.  I have to say that this was very refreshing, I hate being bothered to often.  We decided to split a desert of tartufo very yummy and a great way to end the meal.  For the bottle of wine, main and desert it was under $80.00, not bad I think.  The only thing I can complain about - it was HOT in there...."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Great food, their pasta and pizza is fresh, different and good variety."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Italian food - I not a fan of pizza and I don't like pasta at all. Grazie was nearby with decent ratings. After looking at their menu online, which had a ton of options, I decided to check this place out. There has to be SOMETHING that I like.  Everyone who worked here seemed so happy, and our server was super fun. I got the Giovanni pizza - something that you honestly can't go wrong, with pepperoni and spicy sausage. Food came and the portion was massive. I could barely finish half of it. It came with the oily looking hot sauce, which is honestly addicting. I swear I was drenching my pizza in it. The pizza itself was exceptional. The crust, the dough, and the toppings were on point. It tasted what pizza would taste like if i get to call the shots.   I've been to many mid-high end Italian restaurants and nowhere has delicious pizza like Grazi does. Best thing is, it's a lot cheaper too."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant was fantastic! From the drinks to the food to the service, amazing! I ordered a margarita which they made from scratch. I also ordered a caprese style salad which was super fresh and the serving size was much larger than expected. For my main course, I ordered the Tasca pasta. It was incredible. Our server was very prompt and friendly. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great. The workers are always on point professional and the service is great.  Very clean and classy spot to have the best pasta & pizza. I love going here for dates. A family friendly environment. Hands down the nicest place to go for fancy italian food."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day of my life if i worked closer to here and made enough money to cover it.    I went here with my fiancee for our anniversary one year and I can't wait to find a reason to go back.   We went without a reservation made so we had to wait, but while we were in line we were given complimentary slices of pizza and were well taken care of until we were seated.   I got the Torino pasta and would HIGHLY recommend it. We also shared the Bruscetta which was fresh and delicious.  Service was slow but they were packed at the time so it didn't bother me as much.  I'd go there anytime given the chance."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Whiting fish which is known as the fish of the poor......... You gotta try their Merluzzo salad. It's incredibe! Their pasta is made to order therefore it comes to your table piping hot and fresh! They have an excellent staff, great wine selections, and decadent desserts."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often with colleagues and have business dinners for clients as well. The food is good, however note the waiting time for both the food and your table (if you haven't booked in advance) will be long.  This place is always full."}
{"text":"Craving some pasta so we visited this restaurant since it has great reviews online.  They have a huge variety of pasta. They separate their pasta into different categories based on sauce. Most pasta dishes are simple and do not contain that much meat or seafood. But you can add sausage, chicken or prosciutto for an extra charge. If you don't like pasta they also have a few other dishes like salads and pizza  The pasta menu is set pretty much as is. You cannot customize your dishes that much. They will only do some minor adjustments.   The restaurant serves complementary bread but they were extreme cold. Not fresh at all. The crust is not crispy and very difficult to rip apart. The inside of the bread is soft but taste a bit sour.   Stefania ($16.50) - cream sauce pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto. The pizza was kinda difficult to eat because all the veggies and prosciutto is just places on top. Not sure if it's supposed to be like that. It was not secure so kinda difficult to bite because stuff was falling off. Felt like the pizza was not saucy enough, I could barely taste the creaminess. The crust was also a little to thick. I prefer thin crusted pizzas better.    Avellino ($15.75)- olive oil and garlic pasta topped with prosciutto. I think that the portion was average compared to most places. The fettuccine was a little hard. Would be better if it was softer. Flavour is decent.   Service is not that great. It was very difficult to get a hold of the waiter.   Overall, the place is okay but I'm not a fan of it.   They validate parking if you park at 2401 Yonge street only after 6pm or on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pasta, but they do it really well. And their stuffed chicken or veal isn't too bad either.  my favourite thing on their menu is silo insalata, kinda like a seafood ceviche on a fresh salad.   Good service  and busy place.   Worth a visit, but not one of a kind."}
{"text":"Grazie is Grazie at the end of the day. It's reliable to a flaw.   The food is good (but not excellent - so there's always a better option for Italian out there).   It's branding really and a fun place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Besides a few glitches (I'll get back to those later) let's say that the food is of high quality and very good standards. The staff has been very accommodating to satisfy some special needs in terms of modifying a dish to the guest's tastes. The portions are way past realonavle and fill the hunger with ease and mouth pleasure. At the end of the meal, the chocolate desert has been a flamboyant tasting experience and the short espresso did put a strong period to end the dinner. The drawbacks are a too noisy environment, where the modern music is really not needed, especially because the room infrastructure makes the conversation totalling into a high permanent buzz.  Other than that, a good experience from the palate perspective."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I shared 3 entrees: Nico, Catrina and Eligio. The Nico and Eligio were amazing, cooke to perfection! The atmosphere is fun and authentic but it is very busy and the tables are slightly cramped together. I didn't get to try their desserts but they looked so delicious. I definitely plan on going back here as soon as I can. The service was OK but the food, wine and environment were great! 4 stars! Oh, and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Good Neighbourhood Ristorante. The menu is great and you can also  get delivery, which is great when you don't want to go out. Not a place for a quiet meal but fun when you need to be around lots of energy and good food. Try it!"}
{"text":"Grazie is one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto. There are some who argue it's not authentic. I traveled all over Italy and it's really difficult to find something authentic even in Italy.  Food here is great, service is good, always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place... their pasta's are amazingly delicious that I have never had a chance to try anything other than Udine... Perhaps I have been here more than 10 times but Udine + added chicken IZ my choice... you will not get this Pasta anywhere else... even in other amazing Italian restaurants"}
{"text":"I  like this place more for the atmosphere and service than for the food. As a semi decent cook (tooting my own horn here....toot toot!) I find I can usually crank out some pretty decent pasta dishes on par with most mid-range Italian restaurants. I would say that what I cook is on par with this place. The food is decent and well priced. What I like about this place: A lot of vegetarian options!   Really great service!  Tons of seating that can accommodate almost any group size!  I would definitely go for dinner/drinks here with friends."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It's nearby and it's a real Italian food. The waiters are super friendly and very polite. You never have to ask for a glass of water and the price is reasonable. So many choices of pasta, pizza and dessert! I just wish I tip more! 15% is not enough for the great service, I was just too busy chatting with my friends lol. I will def. come back again with my husband :-)"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 Stars   VIBE  It's one of those busy, bustling Italian neighbourhood restaurants. Rightly so. It's been in the Yonge/Eg nabe for YEARS. Kind of like \"Cheers\" but for Italian food lovers. I can't guarantee they're going to yell \"Gianni!\" like they would \"Norm!\" though.  Service here is GREAT. On time. On the ball. With a smile. Boom! Note: I was here at lunch. Have visited for dinner eons ago so am unsure if service is different but know that the line ups still do exist.   WE ATE  I had the Milano - linguini with snow peas, chicken and sundried tomatoes, smothered in a cream sauce. The ratio of sauce to pasta was great but I felt like the dish lacked flavour.   I do like that they have categories of sauces on the menu: creamy tomato sauce, creamy sauce, regular tomato sauce. This makes ordering based on cravings so much easier. Nailed it.   Dining Companion had the quattro fromagi pizza. He enjoyed it. I had a slice of the gorgonzola. A little strong for my taste but still, good!   The bread here is pretty delicious as well but make sure to ask for some olive oil in advance.   Bonus points: coke in the bottle.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Don't come here if you're on the Atkins Diet. Duh!"}
{"text":"Grazie's is one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Toronto, and definitely the best in terms of quality in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Last night, we tried the Stefania pizza (cream sauce, mushrooms, arugula and prosciutto), Basta pasta (spinach linguini with shrimp cream sauce), and Teramo pasta (veggies and goat cheese in garlic olive oil). I try to order something new each time, and would recommend the Tasca (basically a huge ravioli stuffed with cheese). Each dish mentioned above is about $16-20 before tax and tip. Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar are also great for dipping bread! Service is very friendly, despite how busy they are."}
{"text":"To start off, I've been to the Woodbridge location before and I was not blown away by the gnocchi that I had ordered. So, when my friend recommended we go to the Eglinton location, I was a bit hesitant. The reason I decided to go was because I remembered how delicious their tiramisu was.  After scanning the menu and looking through some yelpers' pictures, I decided I wanted to have the Basta pasta dish with creamy sauce. Someone had posted a picture of it with what seemed to be no sauce and another with ros√© sauce. I asked the server about the ros√© one and he said that isn't how they normally serve it and he didn't recommend the switch either. In any case, I was really hungry and was craving shrimp, so I ordered it as is on the menu!   Verdict? It was probably the best pasta I've ever had in my entire life. It tasted soooo good that I ended up using the side of bread they brought us to wipe the plate clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. I've never had green spinach pasta, but it tasted delicious. I also tried my friend's pasta with pesto sauce and chicken and it was really good as well.   Finally, the reason I came for...the tiramisu. They serve it like 3 scoops like ice cream on a plate, which is completely different from the Vaughan location. But oh my..it was still so creamy and just delicious.   Overall, I had a great time! We were seated very quickly even though the restaurant was packed on a Monday evening at 7:30. The server wasn't in our faces and I really appreciated that. He was helpful when needed. The food was incredible and I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I had been craving pasta for a good little while and somewhat knew where I wanted to go already too. It has been a while since I've been to Grazie, but I remember the food tasting great and oh my goodness the tiramisu. Finally found someone who was willing to go with me, so I went out with my sister for some Italian food!  I called ahead of time to see whether they were fully packed. Last time I tried going, there was over an hour wait...so we decided to go elsewhere. I wanted to be prepared this time. The gentleman over the phone said they were busy, but it shouldn't be too long of a wait for two people. Okay, great!  We came down and were informed that a table should open up in about 25minutes. So we actually ended up waiting about 10 and had decided what we would order while waiting.   My sister got the Capri (Linguine with shrimps, clams & diced tomatoes) and I went for my beloved Basta (Spinach linguine with shrimps, green onions & parsley). We didn't wait too long, but had received their complimentary bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic in the meantime. The bread was unfortunately cold and didn't taste like it was freshly taken out of the oven, but the restaurant was full so it was to be expected.   The food was delicious! I loved my pasta and even though I was just about ready to burst, I still forced myself to finish every last bit of it. My sister tried my dish and loved it too. I tasted some of hers and thought it was pretty good too. It had hints of anise that surprised me. She didn't particularly enjoy that bit about the Capri, but she ate it all!   Then, how could we finish our meal without Tiramisu. Honestly, it is so delicious. They serve it like three scoops of ice cream and it has all the perfect flavours in it.   Overall, the atmosphere was great. I feel bad that I cannot remember our waitress' name, but she was so nice. Even the girl that was cleaning the tables made such a wonderful impression on us. I am most definitely coming back here! My sister and I decided that we would try to be less conservative with our choices and try something new like a pizza next time! So stay tuned.."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was delighted to see the variety of options and the flexibility they provided me, with my preferences in mind. Very friendly and accommodative staff. Beautiful interiors and comfortable seating. This place is a must visit if you are on the lookout for very good Italian restaurants in the Yonge & Eglinton area. Truly love everything about this place.   Tip: Don't forget to ask them for a chilli oil drizzle for some extra flavour!   Recommended:  Antipasti - Bruschetta (Toasted bread with fresh tomato, garlic & fine herbs)  Focaccia - Funghi (B√©chamel, variety of mushrooms, truffle oil, parmigiano & fresh thyme)  Pasta - Tasca (Fresh pasta filled with ricotta, spinach, mushrooms & brie baked in a creamy tomato porcini sauce) - *LOVE THIS ONE*  - Bosco (Fettuccine with a variety of mushrooms & fresh rosemary)   Dessert  - Tiramisu (Homemade with marscapone cheese and fresh cream layers in between ladyfingers dipped in espresso and liqueurs)"}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the pasta in a rose sauce. Also ordered the mussels with tomatoes and was surprisingly disappointed. Wine was good. We went on a Saturday evening and it was a 40 minute wait. Standing room only. Busy restaurant. I would go again, just not on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great casual place to enjoy some good food and meet some very nice folks. We were in town for a few days and Grazie was recommended to us by a friend who used to live in Toronto. We're glad we were able to make it over and enjoyed some really good pizzas and salads. Our waiter, Nathaniel, was great with answering the questions we had about the menu...and It was almost as if he had a 6th sense for when you needed something. For those of you familiar with La Villa in Park Slope, Brooklyn this place is similar but, to me, a notch better. Next time we're up in Toronto we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous casual dinning in the city! SUPER PACKED on a saturday night, and they don't take reservations so go expecting to wait for a table.  we sat at the bar for full service dinner so we only waited about 10 mins. and it's such a hustlin and bustlin type of place that the bar was really fun (w/great service from the cute bartender!!)  bread could've been amazing if it was warm when we got it. wine list was awesome AMAZING pasta -- i will come back to edit this when i figure out the name of the dish that we ordered, since i highly recommend it. tiramisu was FAB -- and i usually don't like tiramisu. ;)  approx $80 for two ppl (w/ tip) for wine, two entrees, and a dessert i would definitely try this place again on a more chill night :)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid food.  The waiter could have been better informed.  The special was like 2x the price of any other entree, which was unpleasantly surprising.    Few notes: - Server offered up that he was italian, and had some very strong opinions on things. - Server didn't understand when I asked him for an affogato.   - When asking for a beer like an IPA, waiter had no idea what I was saying.  He suggested that they have some light beers.  I know it's not a beer place, but I lost all confidence that the server knew anything.  That said, the food is pretty solid.  This place could easily be a 4 star, but I have to go by my experience."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Great service and great food.  Loved our server. Forget his name but he was an older gentlemen and so enthusiastic.  Really liked him. And the food is always consistent and great.  Restaurant is clean, plenty of options for food and drinks.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Back when I lived at Yonge and Eglinton, this was one of my favourite restaurants to go to. The service was always incredible and the food was so good that I would crave it days later.   Maybe my expectations were just too high, but I was definitely disappointed with my experience this time around.   To put it bluntly, our server seemed extremely disorganized. Maybe they were just understaffed that night (Wednesday, November 23) but she was all over the place. Literally. I noticed as the night got busier, her service got slower as well.   After our table polished off a bottle of wine, we decided to order another one. We asked a few questions about wines similar to the one we just had, but we could tell our server knew nothing about these wines. I'd expect that at a place like Boston Pizza, but not at Grazie. She was also clearly unaware of how many people at the table were having wine (all four of us) and didn't bother to ask. When she brought the first wine, she only gave us three glasses. We had to ask for the fourth. When we ordered wine the second time, she only gave us two glasses. We asked for two more, and she brought us one. So we asked again for the fourth.   Although my dinner was good, the lack of attention to detail on the part of our server really threw me off. One of my favourite things about Grazie was how amazing all the servers were. I was extremely disappointed with this visit; if I still lived in Toronto, I'd give it another shot. As I'm only in the city once a year now, I won't be back on any future visits."}
{"text":"I've only had takeout from Grazie so this review is based on those experiences.   The food is so good. So far I've tried the Penza which is the popular rigatoni in ros√© sauce, the Torino, which is a agnolotti, also in ros√© sauce and then I've had the Amalia pasta which is ravioli in a cream sauce. The portion sizes are super fair for the price and quality. I've had smaller portion, lower quality pasta for higher prices in lots of Italian restaurants in the city, this is not one of them. Value for your money is quite good. I've also tried the goat cheese salad which is a bit pricier but still really good portion size for the money.   I think that ros√© sauce is the real winner, it's rich without being too heavy and has a nice balance between the tart tomatoes and richness from the cream. Once I've finished my pasta, I can eat the leftover sauce with a spoon, it's so delicious. The portion sizes are probably good for anyone. I've managed to finish my meals most of the time but that's more of a self control issue!!   This isn't a cheap restaurant by any means. A pasta or pizza will run you $15-20 and then main courses are $20+. Not super expensive but also not cheap eats. If you're dining in and having a couple of drinks and dessert, you can probably rack up a hefty bill.   I don't have any comments about the service but we've always gotten nice, generous portions, cutlery, bread and butter with our takeout orders which is nice! I would only assume their dine-in is even better!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I like the food here but the service we got last night was really awful and the food just doesn't make up for it.  We came here for my mom's retirement party and were a party of around 15 people. We were seated at a large table at the back of one of the rooms and the waiter was already somehow annoyed when he arrived to the table to ask if we wanted drinks.   I ordered the Torino pasta and the food came out out fairly quickly and without any issues. I've had this dish from the other location and found the portion size to be considerably smaller. I was a bit under the weather so I wasn't feeling super hungry but I still managed to finish my meal. A few others commented on the portion sizes but it wasn't a big deal. The prices are pretty reasonable for the food and quality. There was a seafood pasta that was disproportionately massive, if you have a big appetite and enjoy seafood, I'd go for that one, it had some shellfish and squid in it. Looked good but I didn't try it. I think the person who ordered that was the only one to take home any leftovers. Overall food is good, I prefer the other location however for portion sizes.  Now for service, the reason for the mediocre rating, our server was really awful and it really soured our experience there. I would assume this large restaurant is accustomed to hosting parties, this server was flustered throughout, was getting mad if someone would get up and go to talk to other people at the other side of the party and snapped at us when we wanted to split the bills a certain way. He basically told us we weren't allowed to move around, which I understand for the purpose of serving and the bills, but for a long table, I think it's appropriate to stand up once in a while to talk to people on the other end, but it just made him even more flustered. He even accused my dad of moving seats which he didn't even do. This guy was increasingly frustrated throughout the night and everyone really noticed. It's unfortunate because it's a nice large restaurant and it would be perfect to host a large party otherwise.   I've been to lots of parties at restaurants with similar numbers of people and I've seen it executed so much better than it was here. There seemed to have been a lack of courtesy and training for this guy and a whole lot of attitude and frustration. I'm really disappointed as this should have been a special night for my mom.   I will likely not return to this location because of the service we received. Management might want to look into better training for their waitstaff for larger parties or keep this guy away from them altogether."}
{"text":"My favorite spot when I lived in the area! Don't miss out the tiramisu for dessert! seafood pasta is to die for!"}
{"text":"Grazie what is going on?? I have been visiting you guys 3 times a year for the past 6 years and this is my first complaint about your food..  Not sure when you guys changed your bread.. I liked it more when it was sliced bread, now they are individual bread rolls and so hard you can't cut, break or bite into.   My friends and I came to eat here on family day and I was so embarrassed, because I told them it was my go to place and when the bread came, no one could break bread because it was so hard and appeared to have been nuked in the microwave. Dry and stale inside as well. We looked over at the other tables and it appeared the other guests were having the same issue. 2 girls sat there and looked like they were having a workout ripping the bread and chewing on the bread, another couple literally took it and couldn't even stick their knife into so tried stabbing it on their plate.  I usually order pasta, but I've had the pizza and this was disappointed too.. it lacked any kind of flavour and needed salt.. (coming from someone who doesn't eat much salt) there were plenty of ingredients that should have brought out the flavour, but it really lacked salt and any type of aromatic fragrance a pizza should have.   Disappointed.."}
{"text":"Grazie is a popular dining spot midtown. I have seen people lining up at their entrance. Luckily, we were seated right away when we went for dinner. I ordered Milano. The linguini was fresh, and strips of sun-dried tomatoes, snow peas and chicken in the pasta tasted great, but I didn't like their cream sauce as much. I saw their cakes on display and they looked really good. It was busy so our waitress seemed overwhelmed. She asked us, \"how are you doing?\" then before either of us could answer moved onto the next table.   This place is small and a little cramped. It has lots of small tables perfect for seating a couple of people on a date night. They take reservations for lunch but not for dinner. Overall, the food was decent and I liked the atmosphere but I don't think this place is worth lining up."}
{"text":"Had their Capri pasta and a glass of Pinot Noir wine.  I may be prejudiced because I was starving but the Capri pasta was really good. It was served hot. Shrimps, clams and tomatoes in it tasted delicious! They provide a complimentary basket of bread with butter and balsamic vinegar.  Their menu is extensive; they have so many pastas to choose from. The service was good but not outstanding. At the end of our meal, the waiter gave us our bills; took them away; then printed us new ones. I am not sure why he had to print them again as my first one and the second one were two exactly same bills, lol. The atmosphere here in the Vaughan location is actually nicer than the midtown location. There are lots of tables, more space in general, and a nice patio outside whereas the midtown location is cramped and doesn't have a patio."}
{"text":"Still loving Grazie. Still great service & food. I've noticed most of the bad reviews were from years ago (2009,2013) so hopefully they keep up this level of service which has no complaints from me. Hubby & I still love this place. There's a reason why it's usually busy at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was very good in general which is the most important thing for me in Italian Restaurant and thats why its a 4 stars.  If you like soft crust in pizza you should request 'not well done' because their default is a well done crunchy crust. The drinks had too much ice in them but where pretty good in general.  The service was solid except the fact you had to ask for water refills instead of them paying attention."}
{"text":"Was in Vaughan visiting a friend of mind and she suggested we go to her favourite Italian restaurant. We started with salads she got her favourite Sea food salad and myself I got the Verse salad which was arugula with pear and prosciutto, I quiet enjoyed the salad it had a really nice balance of savoury and sweet.   For our mains I had a gnocchi with chicken and snap peas in a cream sauce. The gnocchi's were prefect soft and fluffy. The chicken and snap peas were a nice addition to the gnocchi that is usually served on its own. The portion was quiet large so be prepared to take the leftovers home.   My friend had a spinach pasta with mushrooms and Italian sausages. She had asked them to substitute the sauce for a red sauce and there was no issue. She quiet enjoyed it and again portion size was quiet hearty.   We finished the meal with the famous homemade. Tiramisu and it was very delicious, and such a nice light and airy dessert to finish the meal was perfect.   My only minuses about the experience was our waitress was very sly about the split of a bottle of wine. When we chose  the bottle she said oh get the bottle it will be 25 and we thought oh yeah 13 bucks each is good! But the fine print when the bottle arrived was 25 each cause it was a 50 dollar bottle which was Quiet steep! Quiet over priced I am sure.   But overall the experience was wonderful and I would return, I guess i will just pay a little closer attention to the fine print. LOL"}
{"text":"The food was good enough and the prices were fair with pastas at around $16 and meat dishes at $25. However our server was unscrupulous by not announcing the prices of the daily specials. We assumes that they were similar to the regular menu prices but were not. The veal special was $38 and two other specials were $30-$35.We ordered 2 Chardonnays and the server suggested that we should  order 1/2 litre instead which turned it to be $32.We had two deserts and 3 coffees and the total tab came to $229 for 4.Buyers beware!"}
{"text":"My bf and I have been going to Grazie's for 2 years now. We go on special occasions. The service is always great and we always have a great time coming to this location. It can get really busy and packed tho so I just coming in early to get a table. Food is great as always! We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a nice plate of pasta. Huge selection, reasonably priced. Nothing to go out of your way for, but reliable, consistent and great for nights you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I came into Grazie on a Wednesday for lunch and damn was it packed.  However, thank god there were still a few tables left and I got seated very quickly.  The menu is actually quite extensive and lots of options for everybody to choose from.  I got the Sila Salad and Capri pasta. The Sila Salad was very average and actually quite easily home-made; although I have to say there were a lot of shrimp and calamari, they definitely did not skimp out!  The Capri pasta was sooo amazing.  I was actually quite full by the time my pasta arrived (stuffed myself full with the salad, the bread, and my friend's delicious Bruschetta).  Linguine with shrimp and calamari yum.  The extra virgin oil with garlic was actually really light and exactly what I was hoping for.  Again, there were a lot of calamari and shrimp - and thankfully not like some of the el cheapo restaurants (you know there are restaurants where they hope you get full on the noodles and give you like 2 pieces of shrimp).  The prices were fair and not horrendously heartbreaking.  Service was okay; there were 2 servers to each area but seems like only 1 bartender ): my drink took a little.  I'll definitely be back ASAP after I've tried the surrounding Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"My best friend wanted to go here and I was very skeptical because I never go to Italian restaurants. I am super glad she brought me here. We came around dinner time and the place was super crowded and packed. Both of us were already starving so we chose to sit at the bar. Next time, we'll wait for a table.  While we were sitting at the bar, other customers that were waiting for their tables kept leaning on us, if you like your privacy and some space, wait for a table.   Our bartender/waiter was very enthusiastic and awesome. He chatted us up while we were waiting for our food and was very attentive.   The food menu, since it was my first time, I did not know what to order. I was pretty clueless because there was too many things to try from the yelp reviews. I went with a seafood dish, and wished I got the mushroom pasta that everyone was raving about.  I would definitely love to bring my bf to try this place out but maybe we will just go to the one located across vaughan mills."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I wanted to like this place but it's just not consistent. And I really hate that about a restaurant. They lure your ass in the first time with the perfect service and food. Then the next time you go back, things fall short someway or another. And so you decide to give them another chance, and finally you realize the relationship is over.   1st -  I came here, I had the Bosco pasta which is a fettuccine cream pasta with a variety of mushrooms. As well, I had the baked goat cheese salad. I enjoyed both these dishes immensely. The pasta was super creamy and the earthiness of the mushrooms and hint of rosemary really complimented so well together. It was so simple, yet delicious.  As for the baked goat cheese salad, it was something new and somethin I've never seen. It was a phyllo pastry wrapped with eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese with arugula and tomatoes. A wonderful dish.  2nd - Brought my friends here and almost all of us were disappointed. I don't blame them though, I do not remember what we got, but I remember walking out disappointed 'cause it just wasn't good..  3rd - TODAY. I got bosco and the goat cheese salad once again (i know, i know) and the pasta was watered down so hard. I was SO disappointed. And somehow, someway, the goat cheese salad was just not as good. The inside was kinda cold and it didn't spark that excitement I had the first time. Anyway, that was that.  Overall: You blew it and I'm sorry to say.... but it's over."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable Margherita pizza. Make sure you choose the \"fior di latte\" option. That cheese melts in your mouth. Try their desserts too, they're really  good. In case you're wondering where they get their bread, which I can never get enough of, it's delivered daily to them from Tre Mari Bakery (1311 Saint Clair Ave West). If this is your first time in the neighbourhood, you should definitely check out this place. There are other pizza places in the neighbourhood, but if you want an unpretentious atmosphere with quality and affordable food, you can't go wrong with Grazie."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with 3 girlfriends.   I had a pizza and the other ladies had pasta. I think the pastas here are probably a better option. The pizza was OK too though.  Service was excellent. Food was slightly slow to come out but not too bad. Food quality is just okay - it's nothing special but everyone seemed satisfied with their meals.  Adequate wine list with bottles starting as low as $24 (very nice). Most mains are around $15.   This place is super busy, make reservations. Even on a Sunday at 8:00pm with a reservation, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff,  nice decor.  Arrived at 7, luckily the t seated very fast.  Everything good but gets very very loud that it was gets hard to hear each other."}
{"text":"My gf is a regular here, so I come with her about once a month. The atmosphere is always fun and there are always tons of ppl here. The bar is great too if your in the area stop by for a drink!  The only thing I wish for is that they had a bigger selection of salads. I always get the goat cheese salad which is great but heavy for a salad and wish there was one with my greens! Def would go back"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a couple of friends, who also joined me - have been craving some authentic Italian all holiday season.   ATMOSPHERE:  The way the tables were structured made the place feel a bit cramped, but it also allowed more seating for what is clearly a pretty popular place. We were lucky to get a table in the corner, and the servers were able enough to get to us when they needed to. The dining area had a nice buzz going on, but still quiet enough to have some dinner conversation.   SERVICE:  Our food was fairly quick, and our waiter came to us when we needed. It seems as though most of the server's here are actually Italian - our waiter was at least, as he clearly demonstrated when \"showing me up\" with the proper pronunciation of \"Bruschetta\" lol.  FOOD:  Started out with the Bruschetta, which was fair. The bread could have been a bit crustier, though there was a decent amount of seasoned tomatoes on top.   Although this place had a decent selection of pizzas, I went with the \"Penza,\" which is a Rigatoni with vodka, pancetta, green onions and chili pepper. The ingredients were fresh, the pasta was cooked well, and the pancetta really brought out the flavour of the dish. The creamy tomato sauce was among the best I've had.  VERDICT:  I'll be back to try some of the other pastas. Place has a decent drink selection as well."}
{"text":"Surprising how busy this unassuming place was ... but we did go in normal ppl's primetime of 6pm on a Saturday. I had the Giovanni pizza - spicy sausage and peppers on a thin crust.  Good pizza, not off the charts, but worthy. My friends had the gnocci and seafood linguini w spinnich.  I tried the gnocci and it was very good. The dessert won the best prize from our table.  The creme brule cheesecake was superb, but tiramisu was a bit creamier than expected. The only thing I found strange was serving wine in a rock glass?  wtf?  I asked and the waiter had an ample answer that the southern italians and especially at home drink it that way - so they serve it that way ... good enough!"}
{"text":"I came here three times and ordered a same menu, but flavour was different everytime. one was too salty, another one was blander, the other one was good. The service quality of staff is soso. They didn't look genuinely kind. Each table is placed very closely.To be honest, I don't understand why people like this place. Three chances for them were enough, I'm not gonna come back. Byebye."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in a great spot with really awesome food. Best of all it is not too heavy on the wallet for the quality of food."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty decent other than their complimentary bread service -the bread was rock hard, not warm, and just hard to digest.   The service was pretty bad here. Our water cups were always empty and we always had to ask for them to get refilled. We never saw our server but rather he was at other tables that weren't even in his section chatting them up.   And personally, I don't like it when they hand you the bill before they even ask if we are ready for it, or before we even ask for it as it comes off as if you're rushing us out of your restaurant especially when it's not even busy.   Definitely not going back to this location. The one on Yonge and Eglinton is better in terms of service and food quality."}
{"text":"This was probably my third visit to Grazie. This restaurant is more than just food. There are all sorts of ages amongst diners. There are grandparents, children and young couples and single fellows. On a Sunday night you can expect a full house with loud music and a group of servers singing Happy Birthday songs every 15 minutes. I personally love these environments where you feel so alive.  You can sample any wine, but my favourite is their Rose. For dinner I recommend the Milano. It's linguini with chicken and a creamy white sauce."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Servers tend to serve European ethnic people rather than a group of Asians. I sat there and waited 20m until they came and asked if we're ready to order. (?!) The food is good tho. I ordered the Penza. It's just really good and I think it is the best dish there. The creamy tomato sauce is not as creamy as I expected. I don't like creamy dishes but I enjoyed it.  I will come back again for the food but no comment on service."}
{"text":"I don't like Italian food, but this place was pretty good  So far, I only went twice but during both visits I had the same exact thing: Goat cheese salad thing and Amalia pasta. BOTH WERE SO GOOD! And the servings were huge, I couldn't even finish it half way.  The servers were also really friendly, it was a nice little homey environment, it was quite pleasant. My boyfriend really loved it too, so will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"***2.5 stars***  This place certainly does not live up to it its local hype! When I worked in the area customers would frequently gush about their amazing meal at Grazie, so after three months of hearing how good everything was I decided to give it a try.  The ambiance was odd... it felt like an upscale restaurant trying too hard to be casual. Waiters were super stiff (but attentive) and wore dress shirts with denim. My first impression was how crowded this place felt and how close together and small the tables were. I felt a bit claustrophobic during the meal and asked to have my bf and I placed at a four seater.  My bf and I both ordered the wine and garlic mussels along with a pasta dish each. All three dishes were good, but not amazing. For the price I expected something a bit more wow! Speaking of prices... the wine here is absurd! $11 for a 4 oz glass? It wasn't even served in a wine glass, they used wine stubbies :-( Based on my fellow Yelpers I would advise ordering a bottle of wine instead.  I would likely come here again if someone insisted and possibly paid but I wouldn't come here of my own free will."}
{"text":"We tried Grazie last night and if it weren't for the fact that there were 4 of us, I would not have stayed due to the bright lights and no candles on the tables- a perplexing miss and a disappointment. The menu is 98% pizza/pasta so if you are on a low carb diet, which many are these days, this isn't the place for you. There were only 3 non pizza/pasta entrees offered, pricey ones at that. A salmon , chicken and veal-not very imaginative or interesting. Two of us ordered the salmon, and was very disappointed. While it was cooked perfectly, the portion was shockingly small- for $25.00, we expected larger as well as a more interesting presentation- there was no sauce, rub or grill marks; just a simple boiled piece of salmon and a large pile of arugula ; we didn't want the potatoes.  The music was not right for the setting and very loud-not conducive to two couples wanting to enjoy a conversation. Would not go back."}
{"text":"OMG! What an amazing experience! The food was extraordinarily delicious and the service was spectacular!  It was a busy Saturday night, we didn't have a reservation but the 1 hour wait was absolutely worth it. Our waiter Frank made our experience even better. He was putting so much love and care into his job that all 10 of us was inspired by him. He paid so much care and attention to my kids that they keep asking me when are we going back? Needless to say that the general ambience of the restaurant was so warm and friendly. I totally recommend this place to all Italian food lovers!"}
{"text":"Grazie has been a favourite spot for my family for years, and I will never pass up an opportunity to go.  It's a Yonge and Eglinton staple. It's crowded, loud and the tables are tight, but it's a wonderfully lively overall ambience.  The staff (you can't miss them, they're in a shirt and tie with jeans) are extremely friendly, and will remember you. Jack and Rohan are the absolute best of a great bunch, and we have had the pleasure of having them serve us for years.  The best thing about Grazie is the pasta. There aren't enough superlatives to to describe it. Always cooked to a perfect consistency, and topped with incredibly flavourful sauces, I have never had a less than sensational one yet. The tomato sauce is full of garlic, rich, and full bodied. Starting with bread with chili-infuses olive oil, vinegar and parmesean is definitely recommended.  Grazie definitely lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at gratzie briefly for a late drink with a friend.  I really like the atmosphere here. It's casual dining but with food slightly above that cut. The waiter we got was hilarious (his water jug had a sign that read Gluten Free Water- I nearly keeled over in laughter).   But this was a slow night so we were seated quickly and out in no time. My friend had a mixed green salad (it was too basic to even be a menu item in my opinion but he enjoyed it.   I RECOMMEND-  I only had vino and can you really go wrong with italian wine?).  EXTRA TIP- When Gratzie is busy, it's not worth the wait or hassle, but if it's on your way, pop in for insalata or dessert."}
{"text":"DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION  We are regulars at Grazie. Last night I took my wife and mother there for the 2nd time in a week. My mother has a hearing disability and I made this clear when we entered the restaurant. I kindly asked if we could be seated next to a corner section or in the back to make it easier for her hearing. We could see there were still people eating in the back and right sections of the restaurant that appeared quiet. Angelo the front of house or manager took no concern of this placing us in the middle of the left part of the restaurant where there was the most noise. It was disheartening, but for the quality of the food we decided to sit until the noise became too much for my mothers hearing.  I had also asked a waitress for a wine menu and I was met with the reply \"you need to ask your Maitre d!\" I did not understand what the problem was with bringing one wine menu over!  We waited 5 minutes until Stephan our Maitre d came to our table who was very polite and courteous. By this time our experience was already ruined. My mum with her hearing disability was having extreme problems and had to turn her hearing aids off completely, at this point we decided to leave. As my family left the restaurant I took the time to explain to Stephan fully the reasons why we were leaving and was very apologetic and tried his best to make things right. However my family was already outside and the experience was very upsetting to all parties involved. I thanked Stephan for trying his best to help rectify the horrible incident. Stephan also pleaded with me kindly to express my concerns to Agelo the manager, who was sat at the bar using his cell phone.  Upon leaving to return to my family waiting in the cold outside, he saw me and approached me. I said to him the restaurant was too loud for my mother where he seated us in the middle of the restaurant with her hearing disability and his immediate response in front of Stephan and the other members of staff sickened me, \"it is always like this, it is always loud!\". I was genuinely in disbelief and laughingly repeating his exact words while looking at Stephan who could do nothing and had tried so hard to make things right for us. I then walked out of the restaurant.  This is completely unacceptable behaviour from anyone, especially someone who is supposed to be in a managerial position, and regardless of being regular clients or first time customers."}
{"text":"I love to go to Grazie Ristorante at their Yonge and Eglinton location for dinner. We usually goes there for dinner on the weekend since they always have the seafood linguine special that my hubby loves.   So when this location just North of Vaughan Mills opened, we decided to stop by after shopping at Vaughan Mills.   When you walked in, the decoration is identical to the other location with the same colour theme, same furniture and same lighting. The only thing that is lacking is the atmosphere... The Yonge Street location is always busy with so much energy..here it is more subtle. The patrons are little more mature.   There was no wait for the tables when we got there around 7 PM on Sunday..and with tons of empty tables.  The menu is the same. So we ordered our usual pasta and the Seafood special they have. The food were as delicious as we remembered. Their tiramsu was great as usual!   The nice thing about coming here are plenty of free parking!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Grazie never disappoints.   At night they're usually busy. But the wait is never more than 25 mins.  Service is always good - from host, to bartenders to waiters.  My favorite dish is called Nico. (My mother tried to cook this at home now since I got all of my family completely addicted to it lol) Their special is usually a great choice as well!  I personally think the price is reasonable and the variety on the menu is excellent.  I recommend this place to everyone who enjoys pasta and pizza"}
{"text":"I've been going her for years and there's so many reasons why people still line up every night.:)  amazing food, consistent and great service. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"I came here to take my boyfriend on a date and was very disappointed with the food. We sat down.. They brought us hard, cold bread and oil for dipping. COLD!? And HARD!? Like my gums were hurting after eating this bread. He ordered the steak and it was 25$ and looked like it was only 5oz and it came with cold uncooked potatoes.. and no veg. I got 11$ pasta which was really good but A small serving.. What is up with the food here?! I've been to the location on Yonge and Eglington and it was amazing so I expected way more .. Not coming here again. The best part of our date was when we were at Dairy Queen getting sundaes !"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now. My girlfriend got the Milano pasta and I got the Tasca pasta dish. The Milano, which I luckily got to sample, was pretty good. The sundried tomatoes just worked really well with the chicken, which they give you a generous amount of. The linguini was perfectly cooked. The Tasca on the other hand started off as \"okay\" because it was a bit bland, but as I kept eating, it started making me nauseous because of the texture combined with the lack of flavour. Would not order that again. The waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables that she had to cover but she was friendly. This place does get busy so arrive early!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise. To be honest, we were not expecting much out in big box store territory - thought that all would be very plain. Grazie's was tasty with nicely blended & fresh ingredients. Good menu range, not just the standards. Service also very good. Linguine marinate v good, as one other reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"Being TWICE upsold by our waiter wasn't fun, but the top notch service and food made up for it. Try the bruschetta pizza for an excellent appetizer to share. Most of our group tried seafood: I enjoyed a delicious fettuccine with salmon and another got an enormous bowl full of mussels. Everyone left satisfied.  Obligatory Title Pun: You've GRAZIE be kidding me.  Menu Readability: Well laid out. Describes Antipasti, Zuppa, and Pizzas as the Italians are wont to do.  Need to mention: We got in early and were seated comfortably. But by the time we were done, there was a line up out the door. And they don't take reservations.  What this place teaches me about myself: \"Zuppa\" is fun to say. Try it!"}
{"text":"Had out of town company and decided to show them some decent Woodbridge restaurants. Service was fantastic...our male waiter was stellar...friendly, humorous, attentive and knowledgeable regarding the menu. As our out of town guest was overwhelmed by their menu, we decided to get 3 different dishes and share them..with each of us selecting one dish. I chose their potato pizza. Still the best out there..it was delish. Person 2 chose their gnocchi in a tomato sauce. IMHO...it was the weakest of the dishes we ordered.....probably because I prefer my gnocchi in anything other than a tomato sauce. However, it was still very good. Person 3 ordered a pasta dish with chicken, rapini and an herb garlic sauce. It was, IMHO..the hit of the night. I'll go back to order this dish myself. If I could have licked the bowl, I would have, but I had to settle on sopping up the sauce with bread. We then opted for 2 desserts.....their tiramisu and their meringue cake. Both were excellent and were consumed fairly quickly. All in all, a great experience. Our out of towner loved it !"}
{"text":"Passed by this place on the way to somewhere else and decided to try it since there was a big line.  Good choice!  Wait was very short surprisingly 20 minute wait was actually about 10.  Service, excellent.  We had a very nice lady serving us.  Very patient and courteous.    Food.  I tried the Nico? The parpadelle it was very good.  I have nothing to compare it to but one of the best pastas I've had  Dessert.  Cheesecake was very   Overall amazing mains, specials go quickly, if u want it go early.  Lady was a very nice waitress.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place when I was exploring this part of TO for the first time.   It was amazing, the mussels were fresh and very affordable. The pasta selection was quite large and the dish that I had was nice (one with olive oil, garlic, grilled chicken and ricotta pesto) as was the house salad that we ordered with our dish.   The service here was superb. The food was really only 4 stars, but the service was excellent which is what gives this place a little more than a standard 4 stars for good food. My boyfriend and I shared a salad, mussels, and a pasta dish and everything was served split up to accommodate us, and we didn't even ask them to do this. The water glasses were usually refilled and bread was given generously. Not much else you could ask for from an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the termini with mussels and the milano. Both dishes tasted great. However, the service was horrible. We kept being told by the host that it would only be a few minutes, which turned into an hour or so. The wait staff was also very slow and don't refill water at all. It took a very long time to get our bill. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"no impressed with the service. its over packed, and you wont me put on the wait list until the last member of your party shows up. twice i tried to go and twice i had to go somewhere else. not a place to just randomly go with friends. and when talking with the staff all you get is \"we been around for 20 years so we know what where doing\" good for them, but i like a place where im not packed in like sardines"}
{"text":"They have the best pasta in town! And very affordable price. The only thing is we need to line up to get a table, sometimes we have to line up during weekday evenings."}
{"text":"I've never really had to wait for a table at this location. I personally come for the baked goat cheese salad... Sometimes I only come for two orders of it. The pasta and pizza are great. But really, if you've never tried the baked goat cheese salad, I urge you to try it at least once. If you don't like it, send it my way :)"}
{"text":"If you're craving fine Italian cuisine, Grazie is the place to go!   Came here with the bf for date night ;) we wanted to try their freshly made pasta and pizza. We ordered a seafood pasta the Nico pasta, margarita pizza and tiramisu for dessert!  The food was amazing! I don't think I can do fast food Italian after eating here. The service was meh. The waiter was preoccupied most of the time just chatting away with a family and ignored all the tables. Others in the dining room where this waiter was serving was visibly irritated. Seemed like no one could get his attention.  I'd suggest coming at a time when it isn't so busy, otherwise it'll be hard to get anyone's attention to order your food. I'd still come back for the food.   Service: 2/5 Food:5/5 Ambiance:3/5 Cleanliness: 3/5"}
{"text":"Every time I've passed by, I saw that the restaurant is full, and there's a line at the entrance, so when my dad came to town on December, I knew that we have to go there. Especially because we LOVE Italian food. We went on a Thursday afternoon, around 3:30, so it wasnt crowded, and there was a nice atmosphere. The waiter was supe nice and professional, recommended on a good wine and laughed with us the whole time. The variety of the meals is amazing, we both took a bit longer to choose, and it came out perfect when I ordered the peperdele with veal, and my dad had the salmon, and we voth loved it!! I'm lookinh for the next opportunity to visit Grazie again."}
{"text":"I go there at least once a month. Amazing selection on wine, the services is always good and very friendly, the pastas that I have ordered were delicious. I haven't tried them all yet, I always get there Torino pasta and there amazing baked goat cheese salad. The only thing I can say they should improve on is there mussels, they were not very fresh the last couple times i tried it. Other then that i love this place, weather  you want to go in a date or bring your family. And the price is pretty good for what your getting :)"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Grazie for 15 years now and never ever have had a bad experience. The food and service is always fantastic. I have probably eaten there over 100 times.  I bring my mother, wife, friends, and clients without hesitation. Grazie, hands down, is the most consistent Resturant in the city and one of the best.  Anyone that says otherwise had a rare bad experience ( getting hit by lightning  is a greater possibility) or has no idea what a  top notch Resturant looks like."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  This place is always busy!  Had the pizza with prosscuitto, arugula, parmesan sauce?  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for myself. The food was great. The issue was my server who was hardly present during my lunch. I came here on a weekend and the restaurant was half full at most. We were promptly seated and then waited 8 minutes before we got water and bread. When we were ready to order, our server was hardly anywhere to be found. My friend and I finished our water and waited for another 15 minutes before anyone came to refill our water and take our order. Mind you, we sat next to the computer system where the servers punch in, so we saw servers quite frequently, but never OUR server. Our food arrived and it was great, but not once did our server come by to ask if everything was okay or refill our drinks. It was insulting because we saw him asking other guests how everything went and also laughing with them. Every refill after had to come from us asking other waiters as they walked by to refill water.  I wish I remembered his name so I could give a proper complaint. I remember he had a beard and an average/bit muscular build. I wish there would have been a way to redirect our entire tip to the servers who were actually present during our stay."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and the atmosphere.  Sometimes, it can be a bit crowded and noisy, but the food and wonderful service more than makes up for it.  A great place for a first date or when in the area and looking for a nice Italian meal."}
{"text":"The food was delicious however the service was sub par. It was really busy and waiters were simply overwhelmed at that time. My suggestion is to go there before it gets busy."}
{"text":"Come early in the week & after 7 pm if you want less crowd & better ambience  Delicious tiramisu , Zuppa was just about ok"}
