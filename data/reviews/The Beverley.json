{"text":"Very hip spot with a delicious brunch menu. I had eggs with Brussel spout, bacon & sweet potato hash. Loved it. Was a rainy day so sat inside and dined solo but chatted with the friendly wait staff who gave me recommendations on the menu and suggested I tried the Pear Ginger Mimosa - another winner!  Was not busy and I felt very well taken care of. Would certainly come back to try the lunch and dinner menus, I would expect it can be very busy later in the day."}
{"text":"Owned by Michael Homewood and Mike Strong, The Beverley's main floor of the hotel is occupied by the restaurant and bar, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors house the 18 hotel rooms, and a small 360 degree patio spans the roof.  Looking to have a meal and then perhaps take a peak upstairs, we were sat near the back of the restaurant next to a gaggle of girls at a Sweet 16 party all on their iphones. Thankfully, we find this sort of stuff quite amusing. The dining room décor is sophisticated, simple and masculine. The sleek wood bar is supported by brushed stainless steel legs, with industrial looking barstools to match. There are dimpled brown leather bankettes, simple wood tables, and black lightly cushioned chairs. The conversation pieces however are all in the walls- one of which is lined with a cream textured brick, and the other, an old black and white photograph that covers the entire wall.  Speaking of conversation, the volume level in the room is actually quite pleasant- certainly buzzing on a friday night but subdued enough for me to hear my dining companion without having to raise my voice. Upstairs, the small patio is airy, white and chic. The walls and floors are done in a light stained wood, there are plushy white couches and pillows for lounging, and an ample amount of greenery to give that Miami oasis feel. Back downstairs, the service was friendly, albeit a bit absent minded. A tea I ordered never surfaced (which thankfully, was fine by me), and we didn't get water until we asked for it. Having said that, the rest of the meal moved quite smoothly and with care.  Our cutlery and side plates were replenished, the kitchen moved at an efficient and comfortable pace (1  1/2 hours total), and (once we got water glasses), they were consistently refilled. Speaking of refreshments, the drink menu at the Beverly is simple, yet refined- there are a few playful drinks like the Beverley's Hillbilly, as well the old school favourites like their Negroni and French Kiss 75. Their International wine list is also concisely written with wines selected for sipping (aka. ranging in price from $35-65 for a bottle, and available in 6 or 9 oz pours), and those to designed to savour (available only by bottle and ranging from $55 -330 each).  My only criticism here would be that most of the wines available by the glass (aka. the sippers), were largely Ontario based- and if you're not a fan of Ontario wine like my partner, then it's not going to be an easy choice. Having said that, they also have a solid list of local and international beer by the bottle ($6-8) and on tap ($7), so there are likely at least a few drinks in the house to please everyone. Personally, I pretty much wined myself out in France (at least temporarily), so while my partner did settle on an Italian red with his mains, the focus for us was on cocktails. Hey Beautiful!  ($13) Beverley's Hillbilly  ($13) Sparkling Sangria ($12) Of the three cocktails, the Hey Beautiful was by far the most interesting. It was nicely balanced with the strawberry's sweetness, the acidity of the orange, the smokiness of the mole bitters and the tingling heat of the black pepper. I didn't love the sangria, as I found it tasted a bit like watered down sparkling (there wasn't any of the aforementioned fruit puree and just a few lone blueberries), but I could see this going over well in the summer on the patio. The Hillbilly, in contrast, was a lot stronger on the booze, while still managing to go down remarkably smooth. Eric Wood's menu has a clear seasonal Canadian tone, but like Canada, derives influence from around the globe. In the main dining room where we ate, the menu is divided into Share Plates, Starters, Something More (Mains), Sides and Dessert, with a fairly generous selection in each category. We knew it was going to be tough to choose, so we took Chef Wood's recommendations and he brought us this: 4PLAY - A Teaser of the Fall Menu ($29) Oyster Rockefeller Chalupas Finally, an oyster dish you get to eat in it's entirety! It's funny though, because even though I knew the chip was edible, my instincts with eating oysters made me hesitate before putting it in my mouth. The flavours here were spot on and I loved that the chalupa stayed crispy with the cooking. Fried Chicken Sandwich Super juicy well-seasoned chicken and a deliciously fluffy bun- my only criticism was that said bun and said juices (well, plus the juices from the fruit relish in there) had made the bottom bun a little wet. Still, a very delicious two-bites. Ahi Tuna Poke with Roasted Pineapple and Ancho Chillis and Taro Chips ........"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday to try out their brunch menu. I must say, utterly disappointed with the service and the food. Waited 40+ mins for food to arrive. Wasn't even offered water or asked about drinks. Food wise, both the lobster banh mi and the omelet were way too salty... waiters were way more interested in chatting with their buddies at the bar than paying remotely any attention to their customers... will not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having brunch here. The staff were super friendly and really helpful.  The menu was a little misleading - the mushroom benedict didn't have egg listed although the other benedict did - makes it difficult to order with allergies. However, once I mentioned the allergy to the waitstaff they were pleased to tailor a meal to my needs. The big breakfast I had (without egg) was awesome. Proper bacon, none of this overly cooked stuff you usually get in North America, and potatoes to die for! Just awesome!  The atmosphere was awesome, although it seemed very tailored for a girls' brunch. Not complaining though!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH REVIEW  I went to The Beverley for brunch on a Saturday with a group of about 10 people for a friend's birthday. It started out great. Everyone was ordering mimosas, caesars and coffee. I loved the decor too. We all had high expectations. Four of us ordered different varities of eggs benedict. ALL of them came out hard poached. That is NOT the standard eggs benedict. Eggs benedict should be soft poached unless specified otherwise. We brought this up to one of the servers and rather than taking our plates away (not that I wanted to be wasteful), he offered to bring us 4 bowls of soft poached eggs. That is just plain TACKY. It also took a good 20-30 minutes for these soft poached eggs to come out, so everyone's hollandaise sauce got cold and that filmy skin formed on top. While we were waiting, one of my friends noticed that one of her eggs had half an egg shell in it! That was the only plate that got fully replaced.  The other thing that really bothered me was that none of the servers apologized for any of these mishaps. I realize they weren't necessarily the ones at fault but they did not do a very good job at keeping their guests happy. It was very busy and we were a large group but that shouldn't be an excuse for poor service. I shouldn't feel like I'm being a terrible person when I'm unhappy with my meal.  In the end, the only meal that was comped was the one with the egg shell in it. I won't be going back there after that experience."}
{"text":"The one thing that I want to stress about this place is AMAZING service. I haven't felt so welcome at a bar/restaurant in a long time. Perhaps this was because we had a large reservation for the night. Regardless, the genuine and cheerful service we received will make me want to come back and recommend it for other events.  We were up on the heated patio, in the smaller front part of the rooftop (overlooking Queen West). For our party, it was ideal - privacy with an amazing view and a cool atmosphere.   Drinks were pricey, but pretty typical for a trendy bar downtown. I stuck with on-tap beers which were reasonably priced. The cocktails looked tasty, but again not cheap. The menu had some interesting options. I didn't order food myself, but the appetizers my friends got really could have been better. The \"frites\" tasted like semi-cooked potato. Not sure if this was intentional.   Food aside, the whole experience was excellent. Having such fantastic service was a HUGE plus for me. Our server was very friendly and made our night a great experience.   As a trendy hotel bar, this place hits the spot. I probably wouldn't go back for a meal given the not-too-great appetizers we had. But for a scenic heated patio with friendly staff and a great atmosphere, this place is a solid 4/5."}
{"text":"This is a very late review and my boyfriend and I went around the time the restaurant just opened. We were walking down Queen Street and their hostesses were actually standing on the street and we were intrigued so we went in for dinner.   The menu was very simple and the staff were very attentive. We ordered the edamame to start, and From the Sea and the steak (I can't remember what it was called) for entrees and we had a warm almond cake for dessert. Everything was very good, definitely recommend From the Sea. It's basically seafood in a cheesy/cream sauce but sooooo good. The almond cake was nice and warm and not too sweet. Even my boyfriend who usually doesn't like sweets couldn't stop eating it!   Our waiter came and checked on us just the right amount of times. Service was fast and attentive. Hopefully it wasn't because it was a new restaurant. I have yet to return since the summer but will definitely try again and update my review if things have changed."}
{"text":"Had a team dinner for 20 folks here on May 28th. Eric and his team put together a menu and wine pairings that were simply outstanding.   Service was excellent and serving a group our size is not an easy thing. They accomodated every request with a smile and I will definately be back again.  If you go you have to have the scallops... OMG. Best I've had in many years and I travel/eat out 100+ nights a year. Salmon was amazing and the wine pairings were perfect.   Really great rooftop bar to boot."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, friendly staff.  I enjoyed everything we ordered.  I'll be here again."}
{"text":"After writing this review I received what I thought to be a heartfelt and very nice response from the general manager, Clayton. He apologized for our experience and offered to have us back for any meal and foot the bill. I replied as soon as I received the message and said my group and I would love to take him up on the offer and give the Beverley another shot... This was almost a week ago and I have yet to hear back from him. I will NOT be returning to the Beverly, even if it is for a free meal."}
{"text":"Beverly Hotel lunch:  I stopped in here for lunch and was initially impressed with the relaxed vibe.  The staff were friendly, they have a good selection of craft beer of draught and the avocado club sandwich was worth coming back for.  Clayton made sure we were well taken care of, I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks so I can't say too much about the food. Drinks were on the pricey side but nothing too outrageous for a nice bar in downtown Toronto. The cocktails here were stronger tasting that most other bars I'd been to - a lot of them were made with whisky and there were only one or two options if you're looking for the typical fruity girly cocktails. I personally like whisky so I'm not complaining. We also ordered peking duck tacos to share. It's quite decent tasting. Service here was really really good! Will come back."}
{"text":"Completely basing my review on the steak entree. Possibly one of the best steak meals I've ever had. The frites were great and the house made ketchup was very complementing. Service was decent. Small place but good for intimate gatherings."}
{"text":"We saw this place listed as a new opening on BlogTO and decided to try it out. Reservations were easy to book and we were seated right away. The service was great, they were eager to hear our feedback about everything from the food to the music selection.  To drink, we ordered a bottle of Sangiovese which went well with everything we ordered. We started with the 4Play (I hated ordering that item out loud, but hey, whatever I guess). It consisted of four different tapas-style dishes that were all great. They change on a daily basis, but our favourites were the beef cheek crostini and the scallops with apricot salsa. Yummmmm. Next, we had the fried buttermilk quail. The seasoning was so good, it was a little sweet and the deep-fried-ness wasn't overbearing as it sometimes can be. We moved onto the ricotta cheese which was fresh and creamy.  We finished with the foie gras, which deserves its own paragraph. It was dubbed \"torch-on\" which meant it was somewhere between what you usually get when you order the dish and a creme brulee (yeah, I know, amazing). It was served on a Waldorf salad, which was a nice break from the creamy-richness of the foie.  We paid our bill and headed up to the rooftop cocktail bar / lounge upstairs. We sampled a few different cocktails. Our two favourites were the Villains and Bosses and the Pimm's Cup. That said, the standout drink of the night was the on-tap Stiegl Radler Grapefruit. It was so refreshing and delicious, and I'd never seen it on tap before.  The chef came by to talk to us a total of four times throughout the meal and post-meal drinks. All in all, it was one of our best nights out in Toronto in quite awhile. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the worst brunch here in my life. I ordered the salmon benedict and the English muffin tasted stale, felt like I was eating cardboard.  My eggs were over cooked so I had no egg yolk (aka not a Benedict anymore) on top of that, there was NO HOLLANDAISE sauce. The most dry and unappetizing Benny I ever had in my life. The Worst."}
{"text":"This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had. Read on.  Last weekend, my partner-in-crime and I were starving, wandering Queen St W and looking for an interesting place to eat.  We stopped at The Beverly and looked over their menu. The food sounded excellent. We went in.  It was close to 3pm and the place was dead. One guy on the bar, and another one who appeared to be a waiter? We were seated...but it took a rather long time before anyone even came over to ask if we wanted something to drink. This didn't bode well.  We each ordered the same thing, beef brisket eggs benedict. Hollandaise sauce FTW! My lady friend asked if they could remove the beef and make it vegetarian. Our waiter said he'd see what the kitchen could do, maybe add something to make it more substantial, he said.  A while later, our food came out. Remember this was supposed to be beef brisket on eggs bene?  This was more like...  ...grey, dried out, bland, thin, sad #$%@-ing looking \"brisket\". It looked closer to beef JERKY, and even that is a stretch. Jerky is at least dark in colour and is highly flavourful.   I sat there dumbfounded and pissed. But I was so famished, I thought I'll take off this pathetic excuse for brisket and slowly eat what's left. The hollandaise sauce looked more like they broke the yoke on the eggs. It was a teeny, tiny glob of hollandaise. Not generous in the least.   About 10 - 15 minutes went by...and our waiter came to check in on us.  \"How is everything?\"  I took a deep breath, containing my disgust as best as I could:  Me: \"This is the saddest beef brisket I've ever seen in my life.\"  Him: \"OMG. REALLY?\"  Me, in my head: Dude, seriously? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT BRISKET IS?  Me, outloud: \"Brisket is moist and tender, slathered in bbq sauce. This is BEEF JERKY.\"  Him: \"Do you want something else?\"  Me: \"No. I'm starving.\"  He said something about talking to the chef, when his other coworker who'd been at the bar this whole time came over.  Him: \"You don't like the brisket? Let me talk to our chef.\"  WHY DO TWO PEOPLE HAVE TO TALK TO THE CHEF?  When he came out a minute later, he walked right past our table, flicked his hands up in the air, and as he passed, cattily said \"Sorry about that...sorry\"...not even giving me the time of day to look at me like a human being and apologize to my face. Like *I* was the one with the problem. You work in the HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. Is that how you treat your customers? Are you @#$%-ing kidding me?! DID THIS JUST ACTUALLY HAPPEN?  He and our waiter stood together by the bar mumbling to each other. I ate the rest of what was on my plate, now doubly pissed because of the disgusting \"apology\" I received. They took off my meal from our bill. We paid, used their washroom, and left.   I don't know if the chef was truly having an off day, or simply doesn't have a clue in Hell what beef brisket is. But I also know most people's standards for food are pretty low, especially in Toronto. They'd eat shit if they knew it was organic, gluten-free and vegan.  I cannot believe the vomitous actions of the bartender and his excuse of an apology. Oh, I'm so sorry I complained about your craptastic food. Our waiter on the other hand, was gracious and very apologetic. I believe his name was Josh.  Thank you Josh, for doing your best as a waiter and human being in a lousy situation. Your coworker needs a crash course in Human Decency 101 through to 400, How Not to be a Diva 101, 102 and 103, and Empathy 101, 102, 103 through to 400. It's going to be a while, sweety-pie."}
{"text":"I am an eternal optimist and every time I've gone into the Beverley hotel bar or rooftop, I hope things will be better than the last time....And they never are.  The location is amazing, but the service is always such a bummer. From not checking on the table to long wait times for food and drink to not filling water glasses at your table, the service is consistently NOT good. It's as if the staff have something way more interesting to do that see how you are doing.   High notes......  Food: Portions used to be pretty small. They are getting much better and the food I had there the other night was lovely. I don't know if they got a new chef,  but there seems to be a shift.   Drinks: I always love the drinks they make and the approach to cocktails.   That's it from me. Beverly, I would love to go there more....."}
{"text":"This review is based on the rooftop patio alone.    U can easily walk by this place along Queen West because the frontage is quite narrow.  Good thing they set out a few tropical planters and have a greeter with a menu in hand.    We climbed up a few flights of stairs but I'm sure they have an elevator too.  It's a hotel and guests must have luggage...  Anyways, the small rooftop patio has these comfy banquettes for 2 or 3 (if you can snag one) and there is some bar seating as well.  There were a couple of larger seating formations in the back for larger groups.  I can't believe the capacity is for 70 people.  They have a good selection of cocktails and Radler on tap.  That was a welcome surprise.  There's also a grill in the back but the skewers were a bit more charred than I would have preferred so we didn't order any snacks.  Although there were many servers, we had to ask for the bill twice.  The first  person we asked seemed lost and confused.  Since this place was still on their soft opening, I can only expect things will be much more efficient the next time around.    Thanks to Holly for making her drinks with precision and care.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  Now to work our way through the drinks menu...  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at the Beverly was great! The coffee was good - oh so necessary! - and I greatly enjoyed the Banana Bread French Toast (with a side of bacon done well) My partner had an interesting melange of sweet potato, bacon bits, brussel sprouts (eww!), and scrambled egg. TWO eggs would've better suited, but now we know. A nice little spot tucked under the boutique Beverley Hotel."}
{"text":"Our company expects professional, accommodating service from the top-of-the-line hotels such as the Beverly.  The food is definitely on par with similar restaurants- maybe even surpasses it - but our issue was not with the food.  The main issue we had was with professionalism. The waitresses are dressed inappropriately for such an establishment. It's indescribably awkward to house any type of work-related dinner where the waitresses are so scantily clad. In addition, the waitresses seemed to have some gossiping issues- which we unfortunately got to overhear several times during our meal. It is especially shocking to hear bits and pieces of the love affairs between the staff and the supervisors as I can assure you this is incredibly inappropriate in any establishment and can lead to very serious accusations when persons in a management position have acted without discretion and thus taken advantage of the compromising position their employees are in.   It's unfortunate that a restaurant with such promising location  would have this type of corruption at such an early stage. It is a complete red flag for any partnering business possibilities as it present a giant Human Rights issue simply cannot be overlooked.   Looking beyond business prospects- it is completely unappetizing dinner conversation and sickening to even hear bits and pieces of what is actually going on in this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here because I'm on Queen West often and I noticed a new restaurant. I walk in and see that it's very upscale for the area, doesn't really fit. A friend and I sat anyway. We were seated near the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen. The service was okay, although I hated the uniform...a skin tight short black dress (but that's besides the point). I ordered the quail and my friend ordered the burger. The food was also okay, my quail was a little soggy and too chewy for my liking but my friend really enjoyed the burger. My problem wasn't the service, the dress or the food, my problem was that I could hear the chef, presumably, yelling in the kitchen during my meal. It made us feel really uncomfortable to say the least.  At one point I heard screaming coming from the kitchen...I don't know if anyone else could hear at the front of the restaurant but we could definitely hear it in the back. It is definitely a hostile working environment for the kitchen workers if that's what they deal with everyday. I could even see a couple servers making weird looks at each other. The manager should really do something about this."}
{"text":"We are regulars at their weekend brunches. The service is always excellent. It's definitely not formal but rather a very relax atmosphere which is what we need for a brunch. Also love the background music they play there. $11 for Bacon, eggs, fruit and fries at a nice hotel on Queen St W with friendly staff can't be beat. You may also want to try their Cowboy breakfast. It's huge."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food and service are always great.  My only complaint is that I've seen what appears to be a manager who likes to treat his servers like garbage.  I don't know why a company would tolerate a manager who belittles the employees.  I won't eat here again for sure. It ruins the experience for me and the people I bring to dinner.  I've never seen a manager talk to their staff like that and I won't support such an establishment."}
{"text":"Sunny Rooftop in the heart of Queen West perfect for an afterwork drink or lunch. Charming design and really good food like the famous Beverly Club, MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"The Beverley Hotel is one of the newer restaurant/hotel combos that has opened up in the Toronto area. After reading about their 4 Play combo, I decided to gather a group of fellow foodies to check it out!  Nice, sleek, modern décor. Friendly staff.  My 4 Play consisted of the following:  Brisket - served a bit cold. Brisket was spicy. Nothing too special. Lobster Crostini - quite yummy, I wanted to devour more! Smoked Sturgeon - delicious flavours, smoked perfectly. Pear & Pork Belly - good; nothing outstanding about the dish.  I had a Sangria and it was tough to get through. The fruit was mushy and was like a giant mush of pulp getting stuck in my straw. I would NOT order this again. They had previously made the Sangria available in pitchers, but when we came, they were in the midst of changing the cocktail menu so luckily that saved us from getting a pitcher full of pulp.  Desserts were hit & miss. I highly recommend their version of a smore, it is a bit spicy but it works really well with the dish and was one of the highlights of my experience there. The torched marshmallow rocks. Yum.  The donuts were bland and I wouldn't waste putting those calories in my mouth again.  We took a peep at the rooftop patio and it was quite small and cramped; I wouldn't go there for drinks anytime when it is busy.  2.5/5. Overall, I think the Bev Hotel definitely has some room to grow, but has potential! I would give it a second chance in the future."}
{"text":"The location is not easy to find but the view from the roof is just gorgeous! A good place to drink late in night"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little hidden, unintentionally, between stores on Queen St. W, blink and you will miss it, make sure to look for it. The food is delicious and the service is great. We were a large group so we tasted several dishes, and they were all delicious! I ordered the gnocchi. The gnocchi pieces are made like big circles, instead of the traditional small dumplings. Delicious. We liked it so much that we decided to return for brunch. Brunch was just as good. However, the coffee was weak, I recommend ordering tea instead. Definitely order the pork belly bites!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant on the first floor of this hotel was all it was cracked up to be. Great service with super friendly, knowledgeable staff. The food was spot on, not one thing I would change (except maybe more of it!). The seafood entree was to die (so creative and fresh). I would definitely suggest this to a friend. No problem with a larger party, everyone ate together and enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"The Beverly is one of my favourite brunch spots simply because it's affordable, delicious & the staff is super laid back.  This restaurant is located in the boutique hotel The Beverly (at Queen & Beverly). It's in close proximity to the Art Gallery of Ontario & the \"trendy\" Queen Street west neighbourhood. We especially love coming here before heading out for a day of shopping or at the gallery.  The menu has the usual breakfast & brunch fare.  My favourite dish is the smoked salmon Benny ($15), which comes with home fries, perfectly poached eggs & delicious smoked salmon on a buttermilk biscuit. The generous serving also comes with a side of fruit. They also have a peameal version which is equally pleasing. If that is too much food, they also have the Beverly breakfast ($8) which is a steal.   Definitely check this place out if you're in the area & are looking for a great brunch spot."}
{"text":"Brunch review - food and overall experience was not particularly good.  Very disappointed by the biscuit served with the Eggs Benedict, which was more like stale flavourless bread. The onions were not caramelized as described on the menu, which I could overlook had everything else been acceptable.  My orange juice was watered down (it's sad that the OJ at A&W is better!) and my DC's coffee never got topped off, despite 3 staff members with coffee carafes in hand, racing by to serve other tables.  I did not try the French Toast, as it did not look appealing at all (and my DC said it was not good.) Wish the food was better, as the area could use a good brunch place."}
{"text":"Very very very small rooms, even smaller bathroom which doesn't have a sink in it, half of the bathroom is in the room at the foot of your bed. Very small beds. The AC DOES NOT WORK. If your looking to cool off go to the roof that's the only air you'll get. After spending hundreds of dollars for this very small room that I wasn't even able to bring a beer to the rooftop with me to have a smoke. Also the TV is in the ceiling which the motor on the arm was broken so unless you want to see a chiropractor don't plan on watching TV. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS HOTEL, if your looking for just a very small room and smaller bed this place is for you!! I am not exaggerating at all."}
{"text":"Everyday should be like Sunday with a bubbly and beautiful brunch here. Breakfast is religious to some of us, it's not unusual for the hubs and I to be front window fixtures here enjoying their biscuit benny's and people watching or enjoying a summer scorcher on their rooftop patio. It's like home away from steps from home thanks to their charming owner Jamie taking the very best care of every guest, who doesn't love being greeted with prosecco?"}
{"text":"Best patio in the city! Order the Diablo! It's not on the menu"}
{"text":"Had brunch here for my birthday two weeks ago. It's a very nice relaxed space for Sunday brunch. We were greeted right away asked for our choice of seating. Decided to sit by the window so we can people watch till the food arrived.   We both ended up ordering the chorizo omelette. I got mine with a salad and hubsie got it with home fries. The omelette was so delicious! Salad was nicely dressed. Their coffee was excellent.   Overall it was a delicious brunch with excellent service in a beautiful space. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome meal and cocktails there. Salmon was cooked perfectly. The chocolate desert was decadent. Really good cocktails. Love the vibe in this place too. The staff is terrific and very friendly!! Will definitely come back next trip!!"}
{"text":"I went here specifically to try out their High Tea Wednesdays to Fridays from 4-7 pm and was pleasantly surprised by their food.  On the High Tea menu I ordered the COLORADO HOT TUB, a warm concoction of apple cider, tea and bourbon. It was perfect under the freezing temperatures in Toronto these days. I ordered two. Also ordered the Mystery Punch to get some variety. MEH. Just your standard spiked fruit punch. The drinks come in fancy tea cups so that was cute. All drinks on this menu are $5.  My waitress made a great recommendation on the MUSSELS + BRUSSELS: mussels in garlic sauce accompanied by crispy brussel sprouts. Not a big veggie eater but I have to say I was really impressed with how delicious the brussel sprouts were! They were crispy with a hint of sweet and spicy and the appetizer is a decent size for one if you get drinks and sides as well.  I had some of my friend's SURF + TURF POUTINE and man, was this ever good. The portion of surf and turf topped on the fries was fair. Combined with the hollandaise sauce and crispy fries and this makes for a pretty great poutine with a twist.  I find The Beverley Hotel really easy to miss on Queen Street. It looks small but inside is much bigger than expected. Vibe is cool-casual. I would be interested in coming back to check out their brunch and lunch menus, plus their well-known 4Play dish."}
{"text":"I dropped in for lunch, and sadly I wasn't super-impressed.  If I were rating the Beverley solely on the food, this would probably be a 2-star review.  That might be a little harsh, passing judgment like that after just one lunch played solo, but I can only go off what I've had, and since I probably won't be back I don't see much reason to hold off in hopes of sampling more of the menu.  This is a 3-star review because the service was excellent.  The front of house was pleasantly casual and welcoming, while my server was perfectly attentive and wonderfully friendly, without hovering over me to the point of being uncomfortable.  The service was great.  When I walked into the Beverley at 1 PM on a weekday, there were only a handful of diners and we'd all come for the same thing - the 4Play.  It was the only thing anyone was eating.  The idea of a light, four-course tasting lunch at sixteen bucks is a winning concept, and it's clearly getting people in the door.  The presentation - four clean white plates on a large matching platter, allowing the plates to be shuffled around to give you access to whichever dishes you want to go at first - is lovely.  But the food itself was weak, and elements of the concept need to be tweaked.    Unfortunately I caught my server off-guard by placing my order immediately, so I actually received no explanation of what I was eating when it arrived.  When I inquired a couple minutes later, the server wasn't properly equipped to describe all four dishes, so bear with me if I'm a bit vague.  This was the only flaw in the service - when you plunk four mystery dishes in front of a guest, please be able to tell me what I'm eating.  My 4Play consisted of:  -Nappa Cabbage Slaw In Vinaigrette - This was delightful.  I was craving something light for lunch, and the slaw was crispy, fresh, and flavorful with flecks of red bell pepper, green onion, and a sprinkling of nuts.  I'm a sucker for a good salad and I really enjoyed this.  -Mushrooms and Sweet Potato - Served over a splash of unfortunate tomato sauce, the mushrooms were flavorful and the sweet potatoes were a standout, grilled to a pleasant black crisp.  This was a weird little dish because none of it worked together, though none of it was outrightly unpleasant.  I could definitely come to love those sweet potatoes in a different dish entirely.  -Duck Confit Taco - Topped with a bit of nappa cabbage, cucumber, and red bell pepper, the duck was flavorless and the unnecessary wad of sour cream melted through the tortilla like thermite.  This was mucky, cold, and not very good.  -Pear and Caramel Cake Thing - A small piece of cake accompanied by a couple pieces of poached pear and a whole whack of caramel sauce, this was nothing special, but doused in so much caramel it was passable.  Throw enough caramel on anything and it can pass.  This isn't something I'd want to eat again, but that's due in part to the fact that I ate it with the same cutlery that had just passed through tomato sauce and vinaigrette slaw.  This was my main quibble with the 4Play execution - you really need a dessert fork here, guys.  In addition to the 4Play I just had to try the duck fat kettle corn, which was sadly super-underwhelming.  There wasn't alot of flavor going on with a definite lack of coating to each piece of popcorn, and while the portion was huge, the brown-paper-bag presentation was kind of difficult to approach gracefully once I'd gotten about halfway through it.  Was I supposed to tear the upper half of the bag away, Chipotle-style?  It seemed uncouth.  I opted to tip the bag over and reach in sideways instead of plunging myself in to the elbow from the top.  Hysterically, there was so much kettle corn that it outlasted the rest of my lunch, so by the time the elegantly presented 4Play was removed, I was left snacking out of a greasy paper bag wondering not if, but precisely to what degree, I looked like a homeless person.  Restaurants of Toronto, please stop plying ironic low-class presentation for whimsy.  It's been done to death and now it's officially just awkward.  I want to love this place.  The service is wonderful, and the space is nice.  But the food needs to improve drastically, or they're going to have some problems moving forward."}

{"text":"This past Saturday after having dinner with a group of friends we decided to go to the Beverley Hotel Rooftop Bar. I was disappointed that they didn't have any heaters or heat lamps. It was also pretty tiny, and extremely over crowed. They only had 2 co-ed washrooms and the line ups were ridiculous.  What I liked about this bar was the fact that their was a little section to the right of the elevators that we were able to locate, and fit our group of 15 people in it comfortably. We sort of felt like we had our own private spot which was nice. I also liked how it was free cover to enter the bar but didn't like the flight of stairs I had to climb in heals.   All in all I would go back if i was asked to but not if by choice."}
{"text":"LUNCH  The Beverly Hotel (@beverleyhotelTO) which is a 18-room boutique hotel that finally open after more than 2 years in the making. But of course I was there for the food and was excited to finally try Chef Eric Wood (@chefericwood) creations since he left Hawthorne by the time I went.  The entire first floor was the hotel while the 2nd and 3rd floor house the hotel rooms with a rooftop bar/patio which you can take the tiny elevator up.   We went for lunch on a sunny Saturday but was disappointed that they only served a few grilled skewers on the rooftop patio and I wanted to try items from their menu instead.... so we skip the sunny patio and opted to stay in and we were the only one there.  Free re-fills of coffee and Ben probably end up drinking 3-4 cups which means it's pretty goof coffee.   Charred Edamame $6 ~ red chili, walnut, Cape Breton salt, herbs  ~ This was very tasty and we can't help but keep devouring it. Unlike the boring steam plus salt version, this had a very nice pan-kiss to them with a very sticky thick sweet sauce to it with the perfect added crunch from the crushed walnut. ~  I will definitely try replication this at home real soon.   Buttermilk Fried Quail $12 ~ sumac + savory, fireweed honey, onion sprout ~ I just had to order this since I loved it back when I tried it at Hawthrone (post here) and loved it. ~ But unfortunately somehow, this was less crispy and even a bit soggy although the flavors are still there   4 play @ Lunch $16 ~ A quartet of samplings chosen by the chef daily and that day there was a refreshing light slaw + sauteed veggies & mushroom + Caborana pasta w/ bacon + grilled peach for dessert. ~ I was just in craving for pasta that day but would have otherwise miss the meat/protein here.  ~ I initially expected really small portion but it was rather large portion, so so that I have to have Ben finished it...  guess I couldn't have asked for a more perfect lunch at such a great price.   Beverly Burger $17 ~ Guernsey cheese, bordelaise, pickle, watermelon, Kennebec Fries ~ Thought the meat was a bit overcook and dry but otherwise the combination of flavors were great. Love the refreshing burst of texture and flavor from the watermelon together with the strong Guernsey Cheese.  ~ I have to say I love the fries here, it was incredibly well flavor with salt, pepper and herbs... you can basically munch on it even without ketchup.  Verdict : ~ Would definitely love to go back for dinner and try more dishes ~ But have to say service was a bit slow given that we were the only table."}
{"text":"I had a lovely stay here while on a work trip. The staff are incredibly friendly and happy to allow you to use the restaurant on the first floor like a hotel lobby.  Rooms are quite small but clean, modern, and large enough for one person on a short visit. Two people would be quite a squeeze, but doable if you like each other enough I suppose. They remind me of the Ikea floor models of how-you-could-live-in-500-sq.ft.  The restaurant downstairs I thought was mostly okay, although you do get a discount eating there as a guest. I had breakfast there one morning and was underwhelmed with my food. The main door is also quite drafty so the restaurant is freezing most of the time. That made it a big bummer. Great cappuccinos and tea though.   I'd stay here again but probably not eat."}
