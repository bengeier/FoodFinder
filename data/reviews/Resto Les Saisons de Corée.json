{"text":"The best stir-fried chicken (dak galbi) I had in montreal.  The stir-fried rice we got after was also on point. Such a satisfying experience. I would come here again and would gladly recommend this place to my friends. The lady who served us (me and my friend) was so lovely and really helped brighten the atmosphere of the place. I really enjoyed everything about the place. If you visit, make sure to try their stir-fried chicken. Decent price for the portion and especially for its exceptional taste."}
{"text":"We were hungry and excited coming here after reading all the good reviews. The restaurant was surprisingly small when we got here, but that's okay. Things, though, really started going south when we started to order. We ordered the galbi for $23.99, the udon with veggies, and the $12.99 which was described as can be spicy or mild. When we asked for spicy, we were told it does not come spicy. When we pointed to the \"spicy\" description, the waitress says she'll go ask about it. She came back and said it will be available spicy for $2 more. That was not in the description. The food came out, including the galbi. The galbi was bland and came out accompanied by nothing. We had to order rice separately. The udon was accompanied by kimchi and super sweet radish sides. The udon was a little undercooked but was a less disappointing order than the other items. If you are in the mood for Korean food, I'd recommend you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service is ok. But the portion is too small. In another words, it's very expensive. And  it is too slow....we waited for more than 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"The food is so tasty and authentic. I loved the pork belly stir-fry on a sizzling pan and the fried chicken in sweet and sour sauce. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Dislike this Korean restaurant,the food portion is too small for an adult.I won't recommend to anyone ."}
{"text":"It's very simple and clean Korean restaurant that I have been there four times. I was satisfied by eating the spicy cheese chicken that is tender?juicy and flavourful. This is the best appetizer I tried. After I tasted this food, I find how delicious the Korean food is?I got the same thing form other Korean restaurant, but there are totally different. I also tried the pork hotpot that is yummy?The bibimbap is great as well, but it's quite small. The seafood stew is average.  Hovever, I was disspointed by the fried chicken that is tough?tasteless and gross?I don't really recommend the seafood pancake, cos there are few seafood inside.   Although it's fairly small place, there are lots of food to choose?I will go there to try others, cos I think it's a potential place to try different style Korean food?"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat BBQ! Also open til 3am Friday and Saturday! Great for late night dining:)"}
{"text":"A good place to eat korean food near Concordia University. We had deep fried chicken with sweet sauce on top. The chicken was juicy and tender. It doesn't come with rice. We also had the rice cakes. Soft and spicy. I just love rice cakes. They have 2 big screen TVs. Mostly Korean mvs. I've been there few times already and will come back again."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant for their very authentic korean food. I ordered the cold noodles while my friend got the black bean noodles and we were both pleased with our dishes and impressed by its huge portion size. We also got a spicy chicken topped with cheese to share and that was by far our favourite, the chicken was super soft and juicy and the cheese just perfectly melted, making strings as you took a piece of chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean restaurant. Some dishes are overpriced but I would recommend the jeyuk bokkum (and the lunch menu dishes, which are all at a good price). The owner is also very friendly!  Dakkalbi is pricy and not completely authentic but it's the best one I have tried in Montreal. Would definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"SEAFOOD PANCAKE IS AMAZING. Not too many people here on a Monday night. Service is quick and friendly! Tak galbi is also delicious! Very spicy though.  I think I just ordered the wrong food last time."}
{"text":"We went to this new restaurant 2 times and i can tell that owner are really cooking korean style food. Almost taste like if u are in korea. Little to much salty for me but not expansive and great choices"}
{"text":"Very disappoint Korean restaurant.  To start off, their service was bad, not a single smile throughout our meal. When she came by our table to give us utensils and dishes, she just left after placing a pile of bowls and plates on the table and didn't help us give each person their respective bowl/plate/utensils. This was very surprising.  Their pork bone soup was flavourless and hard to chew. It was not cooked properly.  Their rice cake with cheese was super soggy.   This place is so bad that I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"\"This is one of the better experiences in Indonesian food I've had in years!\" is how this review should have started, if Gabo Gabo one block over was ACTUALLY OPEN DESPITE THEIR ONLINE RESERVATIONS SYSTEM NOT MENTIONING THEY WERE CLOSED FOR PATRIOT'S DAY/VICTORIA DAY.  Thanks, Gabo Gabo.   I'll be That Guy here.  I'm from northern New Jersey.  I have been in and out of the heavily-Korean parts of Jersey and K-town in NYC plenty of times.  I've had my share of Korean food.  I am not afraid of big, bright red spicy bowls.  I know my way around the menus.  This, to me, is not new stuff that they serve at Les Saisons.  But what they do serve is good stuff.   My wife went for bulgogi ramen, I went for whatever dish it was that had the three red leaves, the spiciest thing on the menu that wasn't meant to be shared.  It was a seafood broth noodle soup, Chinese-Korean style, with lots of thin sliced pork belly, mussels (not in the shells), tiny shrimp, thinly sliced pounded mochi-style rice cake slices, scallions, cabbage, and tons of other veggies.    Not gonna lie.  This was GOOD STUFF.  The lady waiting the tables asked me if I was OK with spicy food, and I told her to bring it on.  Seriously, I am not afraid of spicy.  To me, it was around 3 or 4, tops, on a scale of 1-10, 1 being a modest spicy tingle and 10 being phaal curry from Brick Lane.    The one reason this is a four-star joint is two minor things combined: -The tea pot was far too small for two people -The banchan (a bunch of small bites of different Korean vegetables and stuff in different styles) was only three small dishes, compared to anywhere between 6-10 or even more that have been served at other Korean restaurants I've been to  Other than that, no complaints.  The ramen in my wife's ramen was clearly freeze-dried, but oh well, can't win 'em all.  My noodles were at least decently fresh.  The broths were very definitely homemade, mine from seafood and my wife's from beef bones.  Plus the bulgogi flavors seeped into her broth over time to give it a nice sweet-soy flavor under current.    There were a few interesting soju cocktails and other things but we weren't drinking, and to my jaded mind, seemed very reasonably priced.    I could see this being an awesome place to kick back after midterms or finals if you're a Concordia student, or just looking for interesting tasty food."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant so much! Their individual potions may not be huge, so if you're in a large group definitely get the plates to share. I love their seollongtang (beef bone soup) and their kimchi jjigae. Their seafood pancake is also very good! (But not their tonkatsu- avoid that one). They often have a variety of Korean alcohols to try and Kpop is always playing in the back. This is a family-run restaurant and you can taste the home cooked essence in the dishes. I hope they will stay open for a long long time!!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 5 people. We shared several dishes. The seafood pancake tasted OK but it was burnt black and not looking good. The fried chicken is amazing.The egg roll is lovely. The octopus ball is just so-so. The stone bowl rice was delicious. Tried the cold noodle, it was dry without soup but interesting.  The music was too loud for a dinner. The service was good. The price was OK. 23 each person, tips and tax included. They even have 5 dollars main dish. Ramin noodle it is. Over all, I will come back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Korean food, and have try a lot of Korean restaurants in Montreal. I have to said this place is legit.   + First of all, it was highly recommended by my Korean friend. She claim that the food is tasted like real Korean food. Plus, there are a lot of Korean families (older generation) come in, during the night. So the food much be legit. + Second, their stew is off the chart. It is flavourful ( Kim chi Stew, Bulgogi, or even Ramen,etc). It have a strong powerful sense of Kim Chi but some how not too overwhelming. However, If you aren't used to strong taste of Kim Chi. Avoid the Kim Chi stew and try something else. + Another pros for this restaurant is the late hours. You can stay till 1 am. It also serve alcohol ( Soju and Korean Rice Wine). Try their \" Fish egg bibimbap\" ( I don't remember much the name), it have a special taste for it, fish eggs and strong taste of dried squid. It kinda pricy ( 12$ for a small bowl), but full with fish eggs. The eggs will pop in your mouth when you chew.  -  HOWEVER, their fried chicken and tteokbokki (rice cake) aren't good. The sauce is lake of flavour and kinda watery. The rice cake is too soft cuz over cook. Fried chicken is also normal, nothing special. You can compare it with KFC.   There are many Korean restaurants in Montreal now, and this place is a unique for their Stew, Hot Pot and Ramen. If you love other stuffs ( aka Fried chicken, tteokbokki, Bibimbap), should go for other spot.   Beware of Friday night, the restaurant could be packed."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a small and simple restaurant. As usual, there's a TV in the corner that displays K-Pop.  FOOD: The food was ok. We had the kimchi pancake (very oily), the Dak Gal Bi (very delicious and spicy) and the beef and glass noodle soup (portion was tiny but tasty) with rice. Overall, the food wasn't the best Korean food I've ever had but it was still good. The only REALLY good thing was the Dak Gal Bi: it was packed full of flavor and the chicken was very tender.  PRICE: Prices are a bit more expensive here especially when you're comparing it to other Korean restaurants. The individual portions are too small in my opinion but the shared dishes aren't that bad. I wouldn't make this my go-to spot.  SERVICE: Service was good. The waitress was quite friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The waitresses were nice and the food was delicious. They told me to tip 15% and told me that it was mandatory lol I was going to anyway but it was weird they wanted exact 15% so I had to break my $100 to tip accurately."}
