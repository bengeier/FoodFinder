{"text":"I was quite impressed with the friendliness patience of both sales assistants that I interacted / both went the extra mile to help me."}
{"text":"The mall is undergoing extensive renovations.  From what I've seen and what is finished it's lovely, bright and airy.  The revamped food court is a sight to be seen and the staff do a bang up job of keeping everything clean and tidy.  

There are numerous stores that have moved so refer to the many mall directories for new locations.  There are also stores that have closed down due to increased rents laid out by mall management.  That is a shame and I will miss, for one, Lords and Ladies hair salon.  Despite this, the mall seems to be flourishing with new renters and new offerings.  It seems this place is popular with parking at a premium on the weekends.  

All in all nice urban mall and worth the trip to Mississsuga."}
{"text":"Square One is a huge mall located in Mississauga. They carry some really nice brands such as AX and Hugo Boss and are currently renovating to open a new flagship Holt Renfrew which will include some really high end designers. Rolex is also opening besides the Apple store and after these renovations are done, will really make Square One an upscale shopping experience. I do like the open atmosphere however, it is sometimes really difficult to find parking on the weekends. They're are a TON of food choices and lots of neat little bars for drinks and traditional food. Overall, they are slowly making the mall a much better place to visit and I most definitely recommend it as it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been going to square one for just over 6 years now. I have seen it grow from a mall that was filled with regular stores and almost always dead and very old interior. And i got a chance to work in one of the stores in the mall and saw it grow better. The interior is absolutely amazing! I love how all the stores are renovating and they all look fresh and brand-new. The new addition of the stores (a lot of them are the pricey ones though) and the expansion of the food court was the best idea! It was always so difficult to find tables in the food court(it still kinda is) but now with the new tables we have more options (more options with the food too ranging from everywhere!) They also have dine in restaurants and a few dessert places (please add more dessert restaurants!) Love the new upgrade in their washroom as well lol. They are still building more changes and adding more big box stores like Holt Renfrew and a few other expensive big box stores (i think after 2016)"}
{"text":"Now that the Forever 21 has opened, this mall is nearly complete. Its location is very convenient--easy to get to and from different places using Miway. I can't really think of something the mall is missing--perhaps a Hollister store?"}
{"text":"Lots of selections on brands......connected with the Bay, Holt Renfrew, Walmart, Simons, Whole Foods. Convenient public transportation terminal nearby.
Basically this area has choices from $ to $$$$, and lesser people than downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"It is the best mall in Mississauga and the 3rd biggest mall in Canada and I live 15 mins away it is so convenient every thing I love to do in the mall it is all there it is a must visit"}
{"text":"Zara needs to be shut down ... They have the worst customer service ever. The employees are rude and the managers are even worse. I will never spend another dollar in there."}
{"text":"I love the mall, been going here for a very long amount of time. My go-to mall...but don't let pictures deceive you :)"}
{"text":"This mall is huge with a big selection of stores, ranging from bigger-name chain stores to small kitschy stores that you wonder why they're even there because no one goes in..there are at least 2 tiny stores selling angel figurines and fussy Victorian old-lady style stuff. But that's part of its charm, I guess. The one thing I really dislike is the upper floor of the mall is sooo hard to navigate..there's no clear layout, and finding your way around without a map is pretty impossible."}
{"text":"Square One is one of the most convenient malls which is close to where I am and let's say I enjoy going to other malls more other than Square One.  Having been here so many times and is one of the biggest malls in Mississauga, I would only have to give it three stars. 

There is a great selection of stores to choose from such as, Zara, Express, H&M, Target, etc and is constantly expanding as it is renovating some part of the mall right now, as Forever 21 and other new stores are going to be opening in Summer 2014. 

However, lets say most of the time you would not be able to find a parking space on a weekend and holidays as it is jampacked!  In addition, with the vast selection of stores, their prices are still on the pricey-er side.  I have seen better prices at different malls with the same stores for a cheaper value at Yorkdale and Eaton Centre.  So shopping here can be a hit or miss for me.  

While for the food court itself, I am not overly crazy over their new food court as some new food stands have been opened.  I always preferred going out to eat rather than eating in the food court.  Once again, it is pretty hard to find a spot in the food court if you do plan on eating there on weekend/holiday."}
{"text":"I used to live in Mississauga until I was 18, then I moved out to NYC.  I miss shopping malls, especially Square One.  NYC doesn't have any of the convenience of just staying in a giant mall, shopping around for hours.  I love Square One, not only because of the shopping, but because of the movie theatre, food court and ability for me and my friends to hang out.  Square One is the main attraction for Mississauga, even Toronto and can't be beat.  I can't wait to go back to visit!!"}
{"text":"Huge mall, best in mississauga area. Every store imaginable. Parking is ok. North side is best. Lots of restaurants surround the mall. Takes a few visits to figure out where you are. Usually big stores have decent sales."}
{"text":"This is a huge mall, that is slowly, getting better. In the past few years, H&M, BCBG, Bebe (not a fan), Sephora, Coach, Hugo Boss and French Connection have arrived. They have also been doing a lot of renovating as well. This is standard mall fare, as the other reviewer mentions, you will most likely only find standard items here. This seems to be a mall favored more by high school kids and surrounding suburbs like Brampton  (and other areas West and North) because their malls are worse. :P It seems like me and most of my friends think we are too cool for this place. 

There is a good sized food court on the lower level for anyone that is wondering. Restaurants in the mall include Lemongrass, Johnny Rockets, Moxies and Earl's. There is also a Richtree Market. The movie theatre is pretty good, sometimes we do get the smaller releases that they get in downtown theaters. 

Overall, I think Square One is a good mall, but it needs to get trendier stores. A suggestion for the people who own Square One, get rid of the Zellers and put in a Holt Renfrew. (one can always dream!)"}
{"text":"Great shopping centre!  Has most stores that anyone could possibly be looking for, with a ton of parking, and a butt load of restaurants near by. 
I may be biased since this is the biggest and closest mall in my area, but it's a good one!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh Square One! My heavenly heaven!!! I just am devoted to this mall, I come here so often and it's a great, convenient, wonderful life.  The reason for a one star missing is probably due to the reason that the parking is always packed... but I take the bus now anyways... All the stores are reasonably near overly priced and the food court is spacious with a variety of foods to pick from (PAD THAII!!!) Definitely my go-to mall! :)"}
{"text":"It's like always open.  Holidays, whatever, for my purposes, it always seems open.  

Lots of good stores, and Holt Renfrew due to arrive late 2014.  It even has Zara which 
Sherway has not (surprising right?!).  I do wish they had a Williams Sonoma and a Pottery Barn Kids.  Maybe in the future!

Also on the wish list:  More sit down restaurant options.  I think there's only Earl's, and Moxie's...but the renovated food court is nice and has a lot of options for diners.  Chipotle is a current fave.  

Parking can be a pain in the butt, avoid the Walmart area and you'll be pretty good.  And sometimes, there's a few open spots in the parking lot by Home Outfitters."}
{"text":"Sunglass Hut in this location is in need of an amendement ASAP. Carla is the most impolite and unprofessional manager maybe I've ever seen. She's not smart enough for her position. As I went to return a pair of sunglass which I had purchaised a day before, she wanted to return me 10 $ less as she said \" the systèm is saying to do so\". The cashier and I were SO surprised and trying to return me back the same amount which I paid for but the manager insist to do what the Dumb systèm showing to return me back 10$ less. As this Time Carla tried not to have any eye contact with me nor replying to me. She just talked to her cashier. TOO much attitude."}
{"text":"Everything you need under one roof!!! Pretty  crowded at all times. You'll need couple of days to look around the mall. Once you know the mall it's easy to find stores, but you have maps and help desk at your service. I enjoy shopping at all times here."}
{"text":"I always have this question - why don't big malls have all the stores of the same kind in the same section? I mean if you are going to  buy a particular item, wouldn't it be nice to have all the related stores within the least walking distance?
but sigh .. that is not what our mall owners/organizers think.
So I love Square One but I hate that I have to walk sooo much just to understand what my options are. It's nice and great otherwise. 
Their food court is good too and now with renovations going on, I believe they are expanding the food court and getting some new caterers .. that's gonna be awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were both home today and had a few things we needed to pick up so we decided to head over to Square One rather than hitting our usual shopping malls (Sherway Gardens, Eaton's Centre). 

It has been a couple of years since I last visited Square One, and as some of you may know it has changed quite a bit. They expanded the second floor and added a few restaurants and a new movie theatre. It looks great.

The mall has all the standard stores that most of us like to shop at. The one common trend I noticed in all the stores was that most of the clothes were fairly common items. The stores were missing the cool articles of clothing that get you excited to go shopping or make you remember a store/designer. 

I think that I might be used to living/working/shopping downtown where you can find the latest and greatest each store has to offer (hmmm, that line sounds kind of snobbish but I it's the truth).

TIP: Square One is OK for picking up the standard items, but if you want the good stuff go downtown."}
{"text":"I have been living in Mississauga over 20+ years and I have seen Square One evolved from being an ok mall to the chic urban suburb mall it is now. It is almost like seeing a whee little caterpillar blossom into a beautiful butterfly. 

The past few years there has been a big push for better brands in the mall. Opening soon is Zara, they got Sephora a few years back and there is a Lululemon. 

Toe-to-toe, Square One is becoming to be at the same level as Eaton Centre and Yorkdale for the suburbs. 

Food wise you can get the standard food court fare. There are quite a few restaurants such as Earls and Moxies in the located in the mall. 

The parking lot is massive, still hard to find a close parking spot on weekends. 

Make Square One you pit stop for your shopping needs if you are ever in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Square One is the exception that proves the rule.

For review #100, I thought I'd talk about a place that has a lot of personal significance to me. I've been visiting Square One since I was a child back in the 90's, and I've seen how much it's built itself up as a shopping mecca akin to Yorkdale Mall. After a recent visit, I thought about how far it's come over the years.

Square One is absolutely massive now. With a luxury wing that makes you feel equal parts inadequate and impressed (with a car showroom, no less), a revamped food court and a ton of new businesses, this is a much different beast than the mall I remember. I used to come here as a kid with my grandfather and try the carousel that used to be located where the Apple Store is. Now it's shop-until-you-drop with just about every type of store you can think of.

This is the type of place where you can hang with your friends getting a drink and lounging on some of the leather chairs they have throughout the mall or drop several thousand on designer clothing. It's a mall that has something for everyone, regardless of their purpose or budget.

While there are certain inherent problems with the mall (lack of parking despite the expanded lots, volume), it's not a deal-breaker. Square One is a place I've been visiting for many years, and will continue to visit for many more to come."}
{"text":"This place is massive and great! There are a lot and variety of stores you can choose from and it attract all ages. To top it all the mall incorporates four major departmental stores Sears, Bay, Target and Walmart.  The mall has Empire theatre attached to it and Cineplex is walking distance from it.

It is very convenient as there is   plenty of parking spots and its practically linked to the main bus terminal as well as Go Bus terminal.  You also have playdium and whole foods in the vicinity. 

The food court has been upgraded and provides a variety of different options. 

The only drawback of being a mall as big is a lot of sale items run out quick and you have to get there at the right time.

TIP for starbucks lover there is one more shop inside target!"}
{"text":"My go-to mall always! You can find everything you need in here. Parking is good even though sometimes is very busy. 

But I think they need to put adjust the temperature better and have more washrooms (sometimes the washrooms are far from each other)"}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE mall in Ontario.

It really has everything including Deciem! I'm not sure if other malls have Deciem, but I was beyond stoked to find out Square One does. The mall is pretty darn huge, but it's quite easy to find your way around (information desks and maps are conveniently located). Like any mall it does get busy during the weekends, but it doesn't feel stuffy because the mall is so big. 

Parking is relatively easy to find, whether you're shopping at the mall or heading to Wal-Mart to grab something. There's also a Whole Foods  in the next plaza, which I absolutely love! Another plus with Square One is that they are right next to Playdium as well. 

Their food court has a great selection that includes Basil Box, another of my favourites. 

Even though Square One is quite the drive away from me, I really love it too much to mind."}
{"text":"Went there for laser treatments. Reasonable and good clean place. However, the laser is more or less ineffective. Had 6 regular treatments and still bad result. Then they gave me excuses of skin type. Why was this not explained to me in the first instance. When signing up, they had told me my skin type showed best results. My husband got some laser done too, but instead of decrease in hair growth, it increased. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"The mall is perfect now it has all the high end stores as well as some good old ones to go to. I just wouldn't go there on a Saturday"}
{"text":"I used to live across from this mall. It's always well kept and I love how it has WalMart because then I can buy groceries as well! It is also semi-attached to the main bus terminal which makes it more accessible."}
{"text":"Great shops. Good resturants. Would have given 5 starts if parking was lot easier."}
{"text":"From my first visit when this mall was a total disaster to my numerous visits over the holidays season Square One is, in my opinion, the energizer bunny of shopping malls... it keeps growing and growing and growing...... GET IT?

If not, well lemme break it down for ya homeslice. SQ1 was considered the largest mall in Canada when it was first built in 1973, and it held that honour until those people out west erected that theme-park-mall hybrid known as West Edmonton in 1981 (who needs a roller coaster and a submarine and a pirate ship in a mall anyway..... ok those all sound pretty sweet). That said, it still remains the largest Mall in Ontario sitting at a whopping 1,621,000 sq ft, this makes it the third largest in all of Canada!

Thank goodness for it's size because Mississauga needed this mall, this place is BZ. The ironic thing is that parking somehow is still possible despite the crowds the fill this place to the brim each weekend and during holidays. 

This mall has been rapidly expanding regularly, adding more and more stores and attracting bigger and swankier anchors and name brands. It definitely isn't a boutique style mall like that of Yorkdale, but who needs $2000 Louis Vutton/Prada anything.... (ok well that might be coming).

Which leads me to my next point, the newest expansion, which can be seen from the highway is even larger. The North side expansion just opened in December before the holidays and THAT'S NOT ALL The South side expansion is planning to open in the Spring of 2016 (just over a year from now).

Square One is definitely reclaiming it's spot as a top mall in the country, if you haven't been yet, I'd highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Best mall in MISSISSAUGA. Everything you need is in this place and every year it is getting better."}
{"text":"It is hard to rate Shopping malls but in my world it gets a 5 and this is why.

-It actually has a Buffalo David Bitton store (one of the few left)
-The Bay has top quality Buffalo and all other brands
-It has a Guess and an Express
-It seems to have all major stores
-It is close to Port Credit and the Ruth Chris Steakhouse"}
{"text":"I've lived in close vicinity of this mall for over 17 years.  It has always been my fave.  You can never get bored here.  Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I hate malls, but I do love square one. This mall is always hopping, and has great stores with a wide range of monetary scales. (For instance, there is a walmart and a hudsons bay). I would have given it five stars, however, it seems to ALWAYS have construction going on... whether it be on the outside or inside... it's sort of annoying. The place is always clean though, so can't complain!"}
{"text":"A great mall that has pretty much anything and everything (except clowns, but I see that as a bonus). The mall has a ton of parking (though it could use with more covered parking spots), plenty of spacious entrances, pretty much all the stores you could need or want, and fabulously clean bathrooms. The food court selection is amazing and fancy, and the best part is the accessibility. Ramps everywhere, plenty of elevators and escalators, and information maps all over the place. They've got it figured out here!

It's now become a pretty regular place for me to go visit, although it certainly hurts the wallet.

Bonus: there's a bus hub right in there, so it's transit friendly, and there's plenty within walking distance outside of the mall to visit as well (the central library, the Y, Sheridan just opened up a Mississauga campus there, and there's a skating rink close by in the winter (which is an open area in the summer for festivals and the like)."}
{"text":"This is a gigantic mall!  Honestly they have many parking lots around and they STILL get packed, like what gives?  Anyways, that just shows you how many people shop at this place.  It really has grown a lot in the last decade, and it is probably the best mall in Mississauga.  It houses one of the newly opened \"Simon's\", I'm telling you that store is the bomb dot com lol.

The mall can be accessed by car or transit (local buses and go bus), so it is a great meetup location for those around the area.  Even though I don't live in Mississauga, I do come to this mall every now and then (like 2-3x per year lol).  Muji as you know is also in downtown Toronto, but at Square One you are not surrounded by pen-hungry University students - THEY ARE ACTUALLY IN STOCK HERE lols.  Anyhow, great mall, not much complaints.  I can only say that getting out of the mall can be bothersome because there are so many exits, I always get lost =p"}
{"text":"This is THE mall in Mississauga. Located right next to city hall and right in the heart of all the new condo developments in the city as Mississauga tries to become more pedestrian friendly (ha!). The main transit terminal is located on the edge near Sears and the newly opening Target. There's a major GO bus station just north near the Starbucks/Chapters plaza. I've been coming here since I was a teen and watched it evolve from a large but manageable mall to its maze like current state. The whole square one area is sprawling now and walking from one end to another is a major undertaking, especially with bags in tow. 

They have also begun to re-develop the outlying parking lots into more retail space, adding a whole foods, crate and barrel, spence diamonds and a few others in an attempt to attract more upscale clientele. 

The variety of things to buy are staggering, from food to fashion to musical instruments, collectibles, you name it it's probably here. The food court is located in the Center and has typical fare. Working here as a teen I'd usually stick with the Subway for a quick bite during my shift.

Parking can be a bit of a bear especially on high traffic days like holidays so come early and bring your smallest car. I tend to stick with the underground or garage parking near home outfitters and the movie theatre. There's hybrid and mommy parking near Wal mart which might net you a closer spot if you're so lucky."}
{"text":"I can't believe my friend talked me into going all the way to Mississauga to go to a mall! And on boxing day, no less... But I didn't have to drive, so I guess I can't complain too much. 

As my first visit to the actual mall itself, I found it quite nice. The mall has an overall funny layout, as most of the stores are on the upper level and an odd Y shape. Found ourselves going around and visiting the same areas a few times before turning around. 

Enjoyed that lots of stores had a larger store space and some stores that other malls don't have like Urban Outfitters, Muji, and White House, Black Market. The stores here gave off more of a higher end vibe, similar to Yorkdale. 

Parking wasn't all that bad, as there are parking lots and structures all around the entire mall, with many entrances and exits. Makes entering the mall area and leaving it simpler. 

My friends seemed to like this mall, as there are stores here that you don't typically see elsewhere. It may be a little far, but I wouldn't mind coming back again, as long as I'm not the driver!"}
{"text":"Lots of stores, so much walking. A lot of upgrades happening, which will likely make it much nicer, less 90s. Expensive stores, cheap stores, everything in between. Lots of parking, all free. Open a lot later on weekends than most malls."}
{"text":"A huge and beautiful mall with plenty of stores for everyone and a great food court with so many choices."}
{"text":"Fantastic mall with a bunch of stores to choose from! And while you're hungry when shopping, go to the food work which is always updating their designs to fit in with the times.

I love this mall, I've been shopping here with my family probably since before I was born. I just love it here, and it really goes out of it's way to attract people.

One little negative thing though: the parking! Be sure to stop by early before you spend about an hour finding a parking space.

Overall, a wonderful mall for you and your family/friends/etc. to have fun at while shopping!"}
{"text":"Oh boy has this mall really changed since I was here last...change in a good way!

Went here with my daughter and I must say...it's quite classy when you walk in and they've really upped there game with the stores they have now.  

Great selection of stores to shop from the very nice sized Forever 21, Michael Kors, Sephora, etc.  Truthfully, with all the changes I didn't even know where I was going anymore in the mall.  But good thing they have the maps everywhere to help you out when looking for where you need to go.

Even the food court looks amazing with its modern touches.  I'm not sure if it's really good plastic or glassware, but when you order your food to dine-in, they get served on glass plates/bowls.  Very nice classy touch!  Oh and who would have thought that I would be eating raw oysters in a mall food court?!?  I sure didn't! It probably wasn't the best shucked oysters I've had but come on!! Oysters in the friggin mall lol 

Anyway, I've underestimated this mall and I will be coming here to shop again.  Can't wait to see the stores that will be up and ready.  This mall will be great when all the renovations are complete."}
{"text":"...longest mall hours, one of the best collection of stores, and definitely one of the largest in all surrounding cities.  

be ready to spend some good walking time and money :)"}
{"text":"its been a while since i was here last but things have changed, lots of renovation and the progress is good.  I think this is going to be one of the best malls in the country when they are done"}
{"text":"I love this mall. It has the best restaurants and shops.  Everything you need is in this mall from clothing to groceries.  There are many unique restaurants there.  You can spend the whole day there!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Mississauga and always frequented this mall when commuting to school or work. Square One is continually improving their appearance through gradual renovations and a lot of higher end stores being added. The food court looks similar to the one at Eaton Centre giving you more of a modern feel and an increase in seating space.

I love this mall because it has all the stores I need in all in one place. It never gets super crowded unlike some other malls. There tons of parking and restaurants surrounding the mall. It is accessible exiting off hwy 403 Hurontario and also has many bus routes that take you directly here. 

It is known to be the biggest mall in Ontario and will continue to expand with their success."}
{"text":"Oh man.  The first time I came here, I was a teenager and on the run from the cops (hey, don't judge me - there's a story behind this).  My Mississauga buddies were at school and asked me to hang out for a few hours in Square One.  I did.  However, I was pretty poor, and most of Square One's stores were and still are pretty pricey.  I basically just walked circles around it until it was time for me to meet with my friends.  It was excruciatingly boring, because I couldn't afford anything.  Not that I didn't have any money - I had $23 burning a hole in my pocket.  $23 will get you a pretzel and maybe a movie ticket in Square One, but not enough change for the bus fare home.  However, if you can afford it and like buying random useless crap, then you will enjoy this mall.

It is gigantic.  It's the biggest mall in Ontario and at times it is tedious as hell to walk back to a store you were at if you forgot to buy something there.  They have the most random and obscure stores in the world that can be awesome if you've got tons of cash to spend; for example, Build-A-Bear is a pretty cool concept if you're into emptying your wallet on a custom-made teddy bear for a loved one (or a loathed one).

In my opinion the only really practical and great thing about Square One is the bus depot.  Most major bus routes in Mississauga run through Square One, thus making it the true heart of the city if you don't have a car.  It is a great place to meet up with people who are also as poor as you and/or don't have cars, even just to say hi or grabbing a coffee before taking a bus home or something.  No sweat on anyone's back.  I know it probably sounds weird, but it is the most endearing part of Square One for me.  The rest is just like any mall - you are bombarded with useless ads for shit you don't need or want, security follows you around thinking you want to shoplift everything the whole store, and everything you do buy will invariably cost more than it should.  Square One is a Square Scam.  Or a Scam One.  I haven't figured out which of those two shitty puns to use yet so you'll have to bear with me.  Anyway, it ain't that great.

Apart from the fact that the place is nearly ALWAYS packed and that you will smell like many other people's body odour by the end of your shopping excursion, you can only bring a date here so many times as an adult man.  Trust me."}
{"text":"This is still an awesome mall and you can get really lost here since it's still growing with new retailers (while your wallet is shrinking).

You can get everything you need here, feed yourself and even check in at a hotel across the street so you can continue your shopping the next day.

It does get really busy during weekends and holidays! Parking is insane and may drive you away from this place.

Try to shop during the week and off season. Parking is free."}
{"text":"For once, I decided to walk around Square One instead of just getting my things and then leaving.  Their new food court is quite good as it has a lot of the same shops that Yorkdale and Eaton Centre now have (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, Shanghai 360 and Su & Shi).  

Also, it looks like they are trying to stand out as well as they have put in electronic information directories and their is a concierge next to them so you can also ask them as opposed to finding the information booth and then asking questions.  Not sure how long this will last as it is expensive, but if they keep doing it, they will definitely stand out service wise.

PS - I still hate this place because it's a mall. I hate all malls. lol."}
{"text":"I love this mall! Super awkward way to describe it, but it's designed like a farm land where it's almost cut into sections and has multiple routes to enter at any intersection.

Square One is easy to spot on the highway because of the iconic spinning towers at the back of the mall. Coming out of the highway, make sure you keep right to enter the mall. There's an ample amount of parking spaces, unless you hit a big shopping day like Black Friday or something. The parking tower is where I commonly go to get spots, and there's multiple levels to try to ensure that you get at least a spot, even if it is a little further away.

The stores in Square One are popular and fun to shop in. They're not super old stores, well maybe except the design in Walmart, but it's definitely practical. I wouldn't say Square One is one of the newly renovated malls anymore, it sure had a time where it was."}
{"text":"The foot locker in this location has the worst and most rude customer service. All employees have an attitude even though what I went in for was their mistake."}
{"text":"What makes a good mall?   Clean washrooms!   Great updated, clean facilities.  Pretty good store selection too."}
{"text":"Can someone explain how I ended up in Mississauga?

For personal reasons, I should rate this mall a 2

For terms of stores n stuff, I should rate this mall a 4

So let's compromise, and call it a 3?

Here's the pro's about Square 1:

1. Great location, right off the highway.
2. Super convenient bus terminals (yea, 2 terminals, one for Mississauga Transit and one for the Go!)
3. Great stores, you have all your staples + a few specialty stores
4. TARGET!

Here's the con's:

1. Waayyyyyyyyyyyyy too many high school kids. Even more than any in a mall in Toronto. Just sitting around and being obnoxious. Not that I hate kids, I just hate missisauga kids for some reason. Maybe I'm missisauga-ist. 

2. There's a lot of older people who kinda just lounge around the mall...and stare you down. Super creepy. Momma ain't in to dat yo.

3. The food court is really meh. 

That's it really. Best mall in 'sauga, but malls are kinda eww."}
{"text":"I think this place takes the cake for the best mall in the GTA. Who would've thought? I was skeptical about this place because I heard it used to be ratchet back in the day, but it's really stepped up it's game! Who needs to go downtown when you have most of the stores in one mall? I can definitely see the parking being hell on earth during holidays though.

Why I was blown away by this mall:
1. Food central is HUGE. It's a larger version of yorkdale, with all the pretty seats and black/white themes. It has chipotle (always a plus), basil box (blesssss), a philly steak place and lots of choices and cuisines to choose from. For once it's not all just unhealthy fast food. 
2. MUJI.. in a mall? No way! I'm obsessed with the low cost of muji for minimalist home, body and stationary stuffs. To find it in a mall.. well, I was just speechless.
3. NYX Cosmetics Store!!!! One of the best and affordable makeup brands ever! I thought the only NYX store was in Toronto (nyx in the 6ix). I can spend all DAY in here oh my goooodnesssssss.
4. Urban Outfitters! YASSSS GIRL! Again, one of the reasons why I head DT so often- for UO. This UO is often empty and has most of the stuff I see in Toronto stores. 
5. Biggest urban planet ever, wtf. & For once, I was greeted by employees in this store, which has never happened at other UP stores. (I've always made the joke \"I wish I worked at Urban Planet so I can be paid to look mad at the world\") 
6. This Sport Chek is on another level. They have so much stock of every single brand and amazing deals as well. The aesthetic of it all is also very appealing. 
7. All employees that work at this mall are SOOOO nice. I've never been in so many stores where everyone was so smiley and willing to help out. In fairview, yorkdale, etc.. all the employees barely mutter a single 'hi' and it makes retail work seem like an absolute draaaag. Mississauga must have a higher happiness level and better standard of living, because the staff make shopping so much better. 
8. This sephora is larger than life. With an actual beauty bar that resembles a Hollywood movie's backstage.. damn!! SO large and clean. I love it.

I love square one. It's just so much walking though, because the mall is huge."}
{"text":"For that one stop shop this is the mall to visit. It has everything from high end retail outlets to mainstream smaller retail locations. The parking can be a bit busy (especially on weekends). But the parking is free so be patient and you'll find a spot. The mall has a large newly renovated food area with lots of seating. The mall has escalators and elevators for those who want to shop on both levels. The bus depot area is close by with both Mississauga transit as well as go transit.  The section that used to have a movie house is very empty but it gives you access to covered parking for those who do not like their cars in the sun/snow. Located both in the parking lot as well as across the street are large chain restaurants and a movie house. There is also a playdium for the kids and adults who want to be kids. Square one is a great place to shop and have fun"}
{"text":"This mall is everything.   All the stores you need and want plus Walmart!  Its pretty and clean and very well laid out.  However its still cheaper to shop in the USA of you are an American with the exchange rate.  Outstanding food court!"}
{"text":"I love Square One, much more than Bramalea.
It's so big.
It has a Sephora and Lululemon which I love.
I love malls. I love shopping.
It has a Wal-Mart and tonnes of restaurants nearby.
I know it's a square but I still get lost in it.
I don't care, just more time to shop.
I also like the Freshly Squeezed here, and the Starbucks, and the Second Cup."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of squere one food. Other then eddies philly cheese steaks and yhe japaness udon from the Japanese vendor."}
{"text":"Nice clean mall. Most of the employees at the stores here are friendly. I just wish there weren't as many criss-crossing of walkways of shops. It's like 'have we been here before?'. Sometimes it's almost like you've gone in circles."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this mall as I'm not usually in this neck of the woods. This is an impressively big mall and all I can say is: thank god for the app!

Regretfully, I didn't even get a quarter of this mall covered before I was accosted by a gentleman offering money for my opinion. \"Thirty minutes is all it will take\", he promised... thirty minutes my @$$. Trust me, the ten quid I received at the end of it all was not worth the time it took to do this survey!!!

I was all up for a chat on a mall bench but when it turned into being led to a back office and placed in front of a computer, I quickly had that sinking feeling of regret.

It's completely my fault for agreeing to do the survey in the first place, I know, but please heed my warning - steer clear of these people!

Anywho... This mall is clean, bright and well laid out and once I downloaded the app, I was able to easily navigate my way to the stores I wanted to visit. I hope I'm out this way again soon to explore even more of this magnificent mall but next time... I'll remember to keep my opinions to myself!"}
{"text":"Everything about this mall makes me want to pull out my hair and scream. That said, for folks that like malls it offers lots of options to shoppers."}
{"text":"Square one Holt Renfrew underground climate control parking garage in the winter is supposed to have the heat on. But the heating system is never turned on, it just doesn't make  any sense. Why bother to call it a climate control parking garage if it doesn't function. Better off parking elsewhere like the Hudson's Bay, walmart, city side & the bridge underground parking garage or outdoor parking."}
{"text":"It's always important to look at these reviews at a single point in time. At this point in time, Square 1 is going through a bit of a transformation. Although I've seen many of these transformations in the past, I'd say they are at least better at hiding it.

I got there and this section I usually park in is closed off, I think they are building a whole new structure there, I see signage for a Holts coming in 2016. So I drive into one of the newer parking lots which I find a bit confusing with it's levels, but I still like it because it's bright and has those sensors to tell you approximately where there are spaces.

Here is why it's a 3stars right now. It's not that noticeable, but many stores inside right now are under construction. So I look it up on the directory and I'm like, did I miss it? I check again, walk back and see the store front is boarded up. This happened multiple times.

Aside from that, they have several new stores. The cinemas inside is Empire Theatres and it has several Bollywood movies.

One other thing I don't like is how the directory includes stores on the outside of the mall. I am not going to walk outside to this building, especially if it's a cold/wet day.

One thing I like is the directories have the name of the store in the box. Instead of looking them up on an index, figuring out their letter-number combo, then looking it up on the map.

There is still a lot of love for this mall. Hope the shops open!"}
{"text":"Great mall with over 365 stores from what we saw. Where I live, I don't have the luxury of visiting the variety of store Square One has to offer. It's a treat to see every time my children and wife come visit the area. We get our shopping done in a couple hours and off we go."}
{"text":"I like this mall because it is big. You can find everything from Walmart to Holt Renfrew under one roof. It is well connected to Mississauga transit and has decent parking (although I assume it is insufficient during holidays). I definitely recommend it as a one-stop shop for everything you need. 
The only thing I don't like is the fact that this mall is always so busy. People walking everywhere, stepping on your feet. Maybe it is not as crowded as Eaton Center but it feels like it is just too busy."}
{"text":"Wow they sure have improved this mall ...they put some badass stores in here .pretty impressed to be honest .and I'm a huge fan of collecting shoes and they put a house of hoops in here beside footlocker .omg.....I pretty much jazzed in my pants . I don't have to go to the states anymore just to find the stuff I like ..
Also a Steve Madden store and coach for the ladies way to go there goes my wallet ."}
{"text":"We went to square one today and we spent 20 minutes looking for parking. It was a total nightmare and the worst part was they had one of the parking lots completely closed. It wasn't until we left that they finally came to open up the closed parking lots. But it is the holiday season there are lots of people going to the mall security and mall officials need to think it through before they decide to lock up parking spaces to sit empty if they want happy customers before they are even able to enter the mall."}
{"text":"Square One is an interesting study in the development of what Washington Post journalist Joel Garreau termed an \"edge city\": a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a downtown core in a sub-urban area, usually serviced by a major highway. Square One fits the edge city concept to a tee. You've got your mega mall, city hall, massive condos, branch offices for major corporations, government offices, two mega movie theaters, and sit down restaurant chains that typically only locate in \"destination malls\".

Square One proper roughly has it all: an Old Navy, a Dollar Store, a Hugo Boss store, a Bulk Foods for your Lucky Elephant pink popcorn needs, and Sears/the Bay/Zellers/WalMart. I know you're scratching your eyes at this point so let me repeat it: Zellers and WalMart in one mall. I defy you to name another mall that has that. AWOL is the Grey Legion branch that was there oh so long ago. Women, or men, might be excited to learn an actual Victoria Secrets is locating in the mall. See photos. 

The food court at Square One even has a Manchu Wok. The food court is quiet spacious, clean, modern, and inviting. I've never been thrilled with the restaurants in the Square One food court, however. There is a Burger King right across the way so you do have options. There's also a mini food court on the second floor with a Subway.

The Starbucks is within the food court. For my part, I prefer to dine and then take my coffee in another location within a mall. Variety is key to the experience. Luckily there's a Second Cup on the second floor and a Timohty's near the recent expansion.

Square One is trying to Sherway it up a bit by carpeting some areas and putting plush comfy chairs for husbands to sink themselves into with their netbooks while their wives enjoy their shopping adventures.

Parking is okay but there appears to be no way to enter this mall from the 403 or the 401 without having to take a left hand turn into the mall. I hate making lefts. And that's not a euphemism, so Ron Paul fans please don't message me again."}
{"text":"doubt anyone is here to read my review on square one..

great mall.  gigantic mall.  huge mall.

lots of people.  lots of cars.  lots of waiting everywhere you go..

parking situation usually sucks so I just head straight for the parkade now"}
{"text":"I rarely make it out to Square One - but when I do I make sure that I make it an all day event! I don't find it the most easy mall to navigate, but maybe I just need to visit more often and get the lay of the land (small town girl here). But really - this mall is MASSIVE! I get more steps than ever before in spending the day here. 

I have always been able to find a parking spot when I visit - maybe I am the only one? :)

I really enjoy a large group of stores here - I like that high end is mixed with some regular style stores. I also LOVE that they have a Simons! My favourite store. I like how it's not all little expensive boutique style stores - because I sure can't afford to always shop there! The food court is also quite robust here - basically something for everyone. 

I always suggest taking a day trip out to Square One, there are so many options for spending the day shopping around. There is really a store for everyone!"}
{"text":"Best mall ever. Hands down. There's literally everything in here, from low end to high end, from Walmart to Harry Rosen, from Baskin Robins to (that fro-yo place that I forgot its name because I don't go there), from McDonald's to Earl's and Moxie's. A little something for everyone. Best place to shop, AND it's right next to Jack Astor's, Scaddabush, and Cineplex. What else could you ask for in a mall?"}
{"text":"This mall has a huge variety of shops to choose from and it will make any shopaholic go crazy! Stores include Banana Republic, Champ and Coach. The food court has a wide variety to chose from. It includes Manchu-Wok, DQ and Burger King, etc. I recommend this to everyone who wants to go shopping."}
{"text":"Second largest mall in Canada. There's a ton of variety in the stores and food. You can easily spend a whole day and a couple paychecks here. The retail space also isn't crowded like other malls."}
{"text":"My clients used to be across the street so I would pop in here every once-in-a-while to grab something from the food court. Other than that I've never actually done any shopping here. SO speaking specifically about the food court, the options here are good. There is a range of choices but nothing you wouldn't find at any other mall."}
{"text":"Best Mall , they have everything and it's always busy so you need to come and shop here and they have a great food court and they are open new stores and upgrade the mall and it's bigger !!"}
{"text":"Love square one my favourite mall so far. 
Great food court great food. Variety of stores with a lot of discount ( check well though for greater deal)

Only inconvenience toooooooooo crowded 
A lot of human bumping if you don't pay attention lol."}
{"text":"My go to mall! Well... also because I live close by! 
This mall has gone from 0 to 100 in the past 10 years! 

They've renovated this place to cater the middle class and the upper class. But to be honest the fancy part of the mall is not as fancy as Yorkdale! 

But that's what I like about this mall it's opening lots of new stores and more restaurants! Finally! This is what Mississauga is missing... more new and exciting restaurants!

You'll find everything from Walmart to Nordstrom and a bunch of outside restaurant readily available! 

Parking can be a pain during peak hours and holidays but they've built more spaces!"}
{"text":"Update: Since inquiry minds want to know, here is the reason (which I found out after several emails to the completely apathetic Mayor) why I got the ticket (drumroll please) because I left the property to go somewhere else. So, If you are a mom strolling the mall with a baby but buy nothing, you are welcome. If you are a mall-walker just doing your daily exercises, but buy nothing, you are welcome too! But if you are trying to hit two birds with one stone and think you can park at the mall and do a few other errands while you're there, beware! Mississauga's hospitality knows no bounds! It made me feel so wanted, all warm and fuzzy inside, they really know how to treat their visitors. They had plenty of empty parking spots, I guess they just need some extra money for their renovations.

I invite everyone to visit Unionville or Mainstreet Markham where the parking is always free and plentiful! You will be treated as a paying guest should be treated, not like a criminal."}
{"text":"It's like people in Mississauga really don't have much to do. Go on a weekend and you'll feel like you're trying to find parking for a Justin Bieber concert!

Anyway, what's really cool about this mall is, even though it lacks a forever 21, it's attracted some really good stores over the past few years - Coach, Michael Kors, Lacoste, Zara, Express, Hot Topic and a well-needed H&M. You'll never find good sale prices at any of these stores though as their businesses are obviously thriving in Mississauga. Zara Man doesn't even have a discount section. I find that stores at malls like Eaton Centre and Yorkdale have better sale prices. 

Disappointments: The new Target is not all that it is made out to be, the pet store lost the dogs and cats, and Club Monaco closed down.

Excitements: The food court is being renovated, The Walmart (lol) and the Bulkbarn, whoop dee doo!"}
{"text":"Nice Mall in Heart of Downtown Mississauga !! It's a Pricier Mall so not much of Sale Prices.

Brands wise, it holds a lot of Brands, the regular as well the luxury ones. Recently opened up Simons as well. One good thing about it is the presence of Walmart. So it makes the trip to the Mall worth it as well. 

Appearance wise the Mall is great, it oversees a big area, and a lot to cover, hence you can have a good stroll (that's what we actually go for!)

Food Court- there could've been more options and varieties, the ones here are limited, seating space is good enough. 

Parking - Ample parking available, however you may have to walk a little depending on Entrance as well. 

Shopping Wise it's just ok, nothing much great about it !!"}
{"text":"I lika this mall.  Easy to get to, parking is not crazy usually.  Good selection of stores, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is a great mall at the heart of Mississauga. It has been recently renovated and the new look is trendy and appealing to many shoppers.

The stores in this mall appeals to many, kids, techies, male, female, seniors and the trendies. Most well known is Walmart, Hudson Bay, Apple and Gap stores. Lots of choices to which have their own store sales and great deals.

The food court has been upgraded since the older days. It has everything one can wish for, traditional fast food to Chinese to Japanese, American, Mediterranean and Mexican. Lots of choices and seating for everyone. Also, coffee and tea stores are everywhere and no shortage of.

All in all, great mall and still in the process of upgrading. Will always be my first choice of mall. Choices and the cleanliness is great."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Always crowded. Clean neat and the food court is always clean. The best timings to go would be office hours and obviously you want to avoid it when schools closed !"}
{"text":"I liked this mall because that offerings are quite varied not only in price level but in category.  Not many malls offer a musical instrument store, for example.

My main quibble is not with the mall itself but the choice of an indoor mall to anchor the newly created downtown of this rather pieced together city.  I think it would have been much better planning had they created a more pedestrian friendly outdoor space.   While many of the surrounding office building and condos are nice architecturally, I can't help but feel the area looks a bit sterile."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a mall person and try to stay away from them but when I have to go I go to SQ1. There are a couple of malls near me in Brampton but I find it's worth driving down to SQ1 for many reasons. When I do come down I like to take McLaughlin as it changes to Confederation Parkway and turn in from there.

Yes this mall is super busy but for this reason the chains tend to keep more product/options on hand here more so than the other stores. The mall is also clean, well kept, and they have coffee options throughout with a Second Cup near one of the main entrances and a Starbucks near the food court on the bottom floor."}
{"text":"Pretty standard mall I think. Not your high end mall, but it is large. I believe the third largest in the GTA and fifth largest in Canada."}
{"text":"definitely a huge mall.  I went there because they have a Roots store.  I did not find a food court but they have a few restaurants."}
{"text":"Been coming here ever since I was born, ever since I was born in this beautiful city of Mississauga. 

I know this mall inside and out, and every year they keep expanding this mall with better stores. They going to open up an Armani Exchange in the fall, last year they brought us Victoria's Secret. Can't wait what will come next year! 

PLUS Thai express in the food court and a bubble tease! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Go-to mall for me. I'm here all the time.. now they're opening UNIQLO soon and the Rec Room which is even better. Simon's is probably the best store to open their and the luxury expansion is nice and all, but not really affordable for most shoppers (even during sales). Miniso recently opened as well, however it is way too small and crowded. I go to this mall a lot and I never get bored."}
{"text":"This is the biggest mall in Mississauga!  It's in the heart of what has become downtown Mississauga.  The pro's it has a Target and Walmart for all your cheap essentials. The con's a lot of decent shops but not lots of the upscale.  A lot of your regular run of the mill shops you can find at any mall in Canada.  It does have an Apple Store and a large food court (under reno).  Also cell phone kiosks all over!  For me it was just mehhhhh!"}
{"text":"Gee, who knew \"Downtown Mississauga\" is actually a large shopping mall? That being said, this review is coming from someone who rides transit to get there.

I'm a little picky when it comes to malls for the fact I rather have the food court as close to the bus terminal as possible. This one definitely didn't meet that requirement as the food court is on the other side of the mall away from the bus terminal.

That being said, the atmosphere of the mall is one of the better ones, at least, it doesn't feel all sketched up like many of the smaller/older malls in sketchy neighbourhoods. There's also some neat uniqueness of this mall, particularly the Cityside expansion back in the early 2000s.

I give it a 3-star (3.5 really) mainly because the fact Downtown Mississauga is a shopping mall is somewhat backwards urban planning. Then again, this is suburbia after all. Also, the walk from the bus terminal to the mall is sort of unsafe, as the crosswalk outside the terminal presents a lot of jaywalkers, construction, and occasional cars that run red lights even if you have priority.

Funny how there's a police station before you walk into the mall from the bus terminal as well."}
{"text":"Ah, Square One.  I used to live in Mississauga, but then I decided that moving out to the burbs (from Mississauga, but still not quite rural) would be better, so S1 (which we called it back in the day.  Okay, no, no one calls it that.  But it's less typing) stopped being a regular destination.  

So, recently a coworker told me \"HMV has this huge bargain available!\" without telling me that the product in question has been out of stock for the past several years.  Good call, redflagdeals.ca.  

So the wife & I went down to S1 and asked the nice people at HMV if they had this super bargain. They did not, and neither did anyone else in the GTA.   I really wanted the Pip Boy Bobblehead.

So we wandered the mall.  Nice Apple store, nice HMV, nice Sony Store (we even tried the 3D tv.  I will die without one, and no sadder because of it).  

The food court, which is conveniently located and easy to find, is still good.  The tables have been cleaned and replaced, and they have a Thai place in lieu of a Tim's, and the wife enjoyed it quite a bit.  

Planet Hobby is still there, and stll a horrible, horrible comic shop. Crate Design, with their stalwartly produced lumber furniture has moved, with a Teopia in its former location.

Plus, they have a Hot Topic.  I know this will enthuse many of you. 

It is a mall.  It is not horrible."}

Huge mall. Most of the variety I need when I wanna shop til you drop!

Cons: they need more elevators!!! I can't be waiting forever with idiots who have 2 WORKING legs that are too lazy to take the stairs that are right in front of them!! I've got a stroller!! Priority people!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in this area and used to go to Square One a lot. Maybe I'm just older now and have different taste but I find a lot of the women's clothing stores, especially in the older part, to be kind of cheap clothing.  OR its tons of American stores like AE and Victoria's Secret. Its still big and has a huge variety hence the 3 stars. I prefer the malls/shopping in the Toronto, Markham area for the more sophisticated stuff and Heartland if I want a bargain."}
{"text":"Square One is by far my favourite shopping mall to shop at. It's close to home and has everything that I am looking for. The mall is going through construction so parking is more limited. That just means the mall will be even more better when construction is over! However, I am definitely getting my Christmas shopping done ahead of time to avoid the parking chaos.

The old section by Target has now been renovated and officially open. It's very spacious and nice. Forever 21 will be opening up in the new wing so there's no need to drive all the way to Sherway. I have to say the mall is looking and getting more high end than several years before. The food court has definitely improved and resembles the Eaton Centre. There are plenty of options to choose from and they all use actual dishware for their food items.

Now that more stores are opening up in Square One I won't have to drive to other further malls."}
{"text":"I only discovered after my visit that Square One is the second largest shopping center in Canada.I am completely unsurprised at this, because this place is really easy to get lost in!

I was in town for the holidays, and that one day where I had some time to myself, it of course had to be -25 in the daytime. Outdoor entertainments were out of the question for me, so I decided to wander around here for most of the day.

There's a lot of parking, in large lots as well as a nice parking structure that has some bridges over to the center, which is nice for a day like I had. 

I wish I'd known about the coat check earlier, that's a very nice touch to keep you from getting too hot. There's also a package concierge if you are buying a LOT of stuff and don't want to wander around with a giant pile of bags.

So there's basically every shop you could think of, and plenty you haven't. There are stores and brands from the US, plenty from Canada, and several I've never seen before. It's a lot of fun to wander around, and a good place to spend the day, particularly when it's freezing outside."}
{"text":"Great Mall with everything you need. Yes indeed it's crowded but based on the fact that it has all the shops you need and it's one stop shop for all your purchase. Hell lot of stores and the construction is still going on. Loved the Ambience and Shopping experience.. You got all major stores including Apple and Microsoft. Wall mart is huge here as well. you have Dollarama No frills etc..more over if you are planning to take public transport its the easiest way to reach here and go back. Ambient space for parking, food entertainment altogether in one compound. Really a great place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Huge mall. Lots of choices. Visited the first Target opened in Canada last weekend in Square One."}
{"text":"Let's be honest...this is one of the best malls you could ask for. It's not grungy and it's not pretentious. Always good food options, always expanding, clean washrooms, fair prices. Missing a few types of stores that they used to have and other malls still do....wish they'd get them back. Needs a comic/hobby store, spencers, mindgames, toys r us or lego...u know...the fun stuff. It used to have these."}
{"text":"Aside from the parking, lack of good eateries/higher-end stores, I can't really complain about this mall.  It provides me with my much needed \"Asian Exercise\", a.k.a. (window) shopping, during the colder months when I don't want to be outdoors!

Parking - You just hafta know where/when are the peak times.  I certainly avoid this place like a plague during the weekends!  Where?  There's a small, underground, \"hidden\" lot 'round back of the movie theatres.  Shh...please don't tell too many people!!! 

Eating -  YES, I certainly feel a bit trapped with the lack of affordable options here.  So it's either I load up on a caffeinated drink to tie me over, grab a pastry from Michel's, a $5 sub from Subway (if I'm really desperate!), or head on over to eat at the salad bar from Whole Foods OR across the street, behind the Sussex Centre at Seoul House!  Restaurant options IN the mall can certainly be improved.

Tip:  Due to their tourist designation, this mall also has extended hours, so don't be shy to head there 'til 9pm on Saturday nights or 'til 7pm on Sundays!"}
{"text":"This mall is okay for select stores. I do not prefer this mall over sherway. My problem with this mall is that there are too many little kids running around as well as ghetto looking sketchy characters. Almost all the stores can be found in a differnt mall."}
{"text":"Wow...talk about confusing. We just roamed around aimlessly and finally realized the mall was one big square (duh! We should have looked at the director/map earlier). I'm used to walking down straight corridors or wings, but the whole idea of quadrants really throws you off. Nonetheless seemed like a rather cool place to do some shopping or hang out.

Everyone in the world knows Canadians are friendly, but is it just me or do people here not seem friendly? When say Hi or Thank You to people, they just give you a blank stare like in one case, an angry stare. They must have known I was from out of town or something. ha ha ha. j/k

My cousin didn't seem to think this mall was all that, but I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Square one is absolutely massive now. I can't remember it back when it was actually a square, but I can certainly remember it before it expanded into this massive mall! It is working hard to compete with Yorkdale as we see more and more speciality and high end stores. We have Louis Vuitton now and will be getting a Holts soon. I think that people might just stop trekking all the way to Yorkdale, but who knows. 

The mall itself is under construction right now so it's a bit of a mess in places, but is still clean and safe. The bathrooms there are amazing - weird side note, but true. There are couches to wait for people! 

The food court doesn't have many options in my opinion. They could really do better than the standard asian fare with a new york fries thrown in for good measure. 

Great stores in terms of variety and conveniently has a good life gym inside as well that is very large (2 floors). The parking however, is a bloody nightmare (as it is at ALL malls) but omgosh. People are crazy. I'd advise parking a short distance away and making the walk because honestly, people will stalk the aisles and all pounce on a spot at the same time. 

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with what Square one offers, and despite the amount of people inside of it, it's big enough that you never really feel like there are quite so many people. 

Smart tip? Get a target red card and you can use it at the starbucks inside of target and save 5% on your drink. If you're like me, it adds up quick!"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but the parking is horrible hard to find a parking spot besides that this mall is excellent it has any store and every price rang you are looking for from Armani to Walmart.

Beautiful Decor the food court needs some more restaurants but  i go here for shopping and not to eat"}
{"text":"Though Sq1 isn't the fanciest or the best luxury mall in the GTA, it's large and will have one of the first Targets! They are constantly building and upgrading so even if its an 'old' mall, it never feels like it.

The hallways are bright, stores are all big and modern, and the selection is vast. You'll find everything from Club Monaco, Banana Republic, The Bay, Whole Foods, Apple Store, MAC, and the usual mall food  like NY Fries, Arby's, and Cinnabon.

I used to rank Square One as being a high 2 rating but with the new addition of Zara, Michael Kors, Target and Whole Foods, it squarely (ha!) fits into a high 3 rating.  It's pretty easy to get in and out of the parking lot plus there is plenty of parking.  It's a bit of a nutcase place during the holiday shopping season but that can be said of any mall.  The other good thing about this mall is Fiorio Salon.  I love coming here to get my hair cut at Fiorio.  It's modern, spacious, top notch service, and free espresso drinks to boot. It's been my place for years!  

The only think lacking about Square One is food and luxury stores... sure it has a decent food court but all the restaurants here are really awful.  Earls, Springrolls, Moxie, and the new AYCE are worse than most restaurants outside of the mall.  This mall is also missing high end stores like William Sonoma, Holt Renfrew, J.Crew, and Ann Taylor.  Though I'm pretty sure this mall is not trying to be the next Yorkdale or Sherway... so that's 'a-ok'!"}
{"text":"Lots of shops to choose from and in a convenient location. Close to lots of public transit, and there's lots of parking if you drive there instead. The food court is okay, but there are lots of restaurants nearby that are easily walking distance. Better hours than most malls since it's \"touristy\". Can get super busy on weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I ate this ramen in food court of this mall. 
I remember the store is called I love sushi. 
The name of this plate is house ramen, u can choose spicy or not. But for japanese food, it never spicy for me. 
The soup was incredible, very tasty! The pork cooked very well. 
My cousin ate amai noodle, looks like pad thai and she felt disappointed of it. 
I also tried sushi, salad here, mango salad here not too sour, seaweed kind of expensive, the snail very great, try it."}
{"text":"I am a resident of Brampton and have been living there for over 20 years. I have seen Mississauga and Brampton grow from small towns to great cities. Along with the vast housing that sprung up, I have seen the upgrades to shopping centers. One such shopping center that I saw evolve and upgraded was Square One Shopping Centre. This is one of my favorite shopping centres to go to whenever I want to walk around and waste time or actually buy something for myself or someone else. This place has it all. I remember coming to Square One from Brampton during my lunches in highschool. My friends and I would make a trip down for the amazing selection of the food court in this shopping centre. To waste time even more, we would walk around the mall and window-shop. 

Upscale stores have opened up in this mall including America's own Express. This is one of the few locations where Express has opened up. I am a guy and find it very hard to see variety for men's clothing. But this mall has given me much variety from great stores as Express, A/X, Guess, Zara, and many more. The two floors of shopping are so huge that you are bound to find something for anyone. I think that Square One is now evolving to be one of the top malls like Yorkdale and Eaton Centre. The hours have been changed as well which allow it to be open later than other malls. 

My favorite place to shop! My favorite place to spend the hard-earned money I work for."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Place!!! Went there several times and still haven't been to all the stores!!!
The selection is AMAZING!!! Great Trendy Stores, good Prices, good Restaurants. Sometimes parking can be a challenge though on the weekends."}
{"text":"Square one is a beautiful huge mall in a great area! The mall carries nice and famous brands! They have 
always evolved with the times never been boring like other malls. I love square one it's fun, convenient and good place to spend time with friends or family."}
{"text":"I usually only visit Square One once a year over the last 10 years or more. 

Every time I visit, they are building something new or improving on the existing infrastructure. 

Love how bright and spacious the interior is now compared to years ago. And the nicer stores that have been moving in too!

I never have a problem finding parking even on a busy Sunday afternoon.

I still will be coming to Square One for my yearly visit and excited to see the new stores and business that would be opening in the future!"}
{"text":"Square One keeps getting better while Yorkdale gets worse. Interesting. This place has a great selection of shops and places to eat. What more can you say, really? It's my favourite mall in Toronto."}
{"text":"I hate this mall.   So many stores,  and yet nothing to buy!  The only good thing about it is the Cinabon! 

It's such a nightmare to find parking, except for the spots that are a few miles away! 

Avoid!   There are much better malls in Mississauga and Oakville!"}
{"text":"It just keeps getting bigger and better and it is one of the best regional shopping centers.  

I wish they would bring back the fountains and waterfalls and trees inside the mall.  

Everyone copies and does the same thing... follow the leader, zombie affect.  

So, if you want ideas on how to improve OMERS, Cadillac Fairview, RioCan, 20VIC, Morguard Investments, etc  I will make sure your Shopping Centre IS reaping all the success it could and should get.  

Stop with the copy and paste and sit and wait and follow the rest.  Innovate and be a leader, not a follower"}
{"text":"If you were to take all the malls in Toronto or the \"GTA\" as we Torontonians call it, and make one big mall. This would be it! 
My jaw dropped when I realized how insanely large this mall was and it's under renovation for more expansion! :0
Simon's, urban outfitters, Saje and Lush! Like could this get any better?!.. yes it did!!
This is the place to go for holiday shopping and to get your daily exercise in. 
I was blown away!
From luxury high end boutiques to the low end bargain shoppers! This malls got it all!
Even an enormous food court!"}
{"text":"In my previous life of coordinating medium-sized construction projects (it wasn't always Yelpsticks and FUCing for this guy), I got to know Square One intimately. I would visit the mall often and got to access its strange nooks and crannies, hidden hallways, shipping bays, storage bins full of lost 'tweens, the foodcourt, etc., on a regular basis. 

What I learned is that Square One is a huge freaking place. It's almost planetary in its scope, and the thought of crossing from one end to another was sigh-inducing: like you are about to set of on a family road-trip, and you're not driving, and you're 17 years old, and you have no control over the radio.

So it's big. Here's really what you need to know about Square One:

- It's got a Walmart, Sears, The Bay and Zellers
- You can rent strollers or borrow a wheelchair for the day
- This mall is owned by Oxford, not Cadillac Fairview; your Eaton Centre gift card won't work here
- There is a movie theatre here with 10 screens
- There is NOWHERE worth eating on the mall premises (and that includes Arby's)
- A GO bus to the mall takes about 30 minutes from downtown Toronto
- There is a bulk barn here and that is a plus
- There is a lot of parking but you might have to circle a bit to find a spot
- The Playdium arcade is very close by as well as the Colosseum movie theatre

Nestled in a part of Mississauga that is the most pedestrian unfriendly spot in Ontario (except maybe the centre of lake Scugog), I try to avoid this mall whenever possible. If you have a car however, or are looking for a shopping diversion for your out-of-town friends, you could do worse.

Obligatory Title Pun: May I never go back to SQUARE ONE.

Menu Readability: Bah!

Need to mention: Probably the most VARIETY of retail store types in a single shopping complex. You can get a piano, stamps, tuxedos, a porcelain bust, almost anything. It goes on and on.

What this place teaches me about myself: $5 beef and cheddars? I'm over it. Also, I still have no clue where the washrooms are."}
{"text":"\"Love that place. For the whole family\" 
That was my old review...
My new review is that it's sad that the mall policy doesn't allow taking pictures. I was taking pictures of some flowers by the mall gate. Just outside the mall, when two security guards came to me and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures. As it's a private property and as per the mall policy I'm not allowed to take pictures unless I go to the management to take permission from the Mall Marketing Manager ???
I mean it's just some pics for flowers. Why would I waste my time get permission to take few pics of flowers ? I respect Malls' policies. But when it's that strict it interferes with people freedom
I was holding a normal Canon 70D DSLR! Not a gun!
I'm really disappointed"}
{"text":"Love my shopping and this mall now is undergoing a second upgrade/transformation.  

There are a great selection of shops and a lot of ones that I used to shop at.  The stores are all good sizes and with that said typically there is a bit more availability of products.  

Great food court with like design of the eaton centre, but very very crowded.  The seating and spacing of the tables are very close.  

The new section is getting refurbed and there has been an expansion where the target use to be.  Target is still unknown of what it will be.  My guess is Nordstrom.  

One thing I really like about this mall is there is always a quick spot you can grab a snack or a bite.  There are at least two Richtree locations, second cup, Tim Hortons at the food court and other end of the mall, Ms Fields, bubble tea and more.

The parking is sufficient with several lots and also underground and upground available.  Typically very easy to find a spot.

The theatre has closed, some more prime real estate for maybe a Holts ;p

Basically, the mall lacks more of the higher end brands and maybe a direct train ride for downtowners.

Love this mall!"}
{"text":"LOCATION : Heart of downtown Mississauga.
Beside Celebration Square, City Hall and the public library. 
PARKING : ample parking in open space and indoor building.
AMBIANCE : Good, clean
CROWD : Working families, students
FOOD COURT : Huge selection of fast food. It's crowded and always full at meal times
STORES : Some closed and the theatre closed too but more stores are opening. New wing opening soon!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is my favorite mall in Ontario, maybe even, anywhere, this mall is a bit confusing for someone who has just visited it for the first time, but this mall is just amazing. Wal-Mart, the food court, HMV, this mall truly has everything. there is something always going on here on both the inside and the outside. very clean on the inside, and literally has something for everyone. a true \"ton\" of parking both level ground and multi leveled(south end). this mall also has a transit hub for Brampton transit, \"miway\" and go transit. 
its absolutely worth coming to the largest mall in Ontario"}
{"text":"Square One has always been near and dear to my heart. I've been going here since I was a wee little girl. Does anyone remember the little fantasy fair they had?? The best. It was bittersweet when they took it away.

This mall has pretty much a good selection of both high end stores and cheaper stores e.g. Sirens, Urban Planet, etc. They changed the food court to reflect how it is at Eaton Centre and I do not mind at all! It looks nice and fresh, there are a lot more food choices now. Parking isn't entirely bad as they have multiple level parking by Walmart and The Bay.

Honestly I still enjoy this mall. If you only had a day to do all of your Christmas Shopping, Square One is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Lots of stores, good food options, always clean. Food court is kept very clean. Parking actually isn't too bad. Info desks are always helpful. Better signs would make it easier to get around inside."}
