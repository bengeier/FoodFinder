{"text":"This is an adorable little cafe that's located pretty far west on Dundas. We sort of stumbled up on this spot by accident, but were pleasantly surprised by the super friendly owners.  

They have all organic, fair trade coffee; all-day breakfast (including Gryfe's bagels); homemade baked muffins (butter tart flavour on the day we visited); two types of pie; and a full menu of sandwiches, about six different soups; and other homestyle foods. I was also impressed by their list of vegetarian options - veggie chili; veggie sloppy joes; borscht; lentil soups; etc. 

The breakfast plate is quite healthy - two eggs; multigrain toast; fresh fruit; including pineapple!); and tomatoes and cucumber slices - no greasy meat/potatoes. I also like that they give you a little bown of vegetable crisps on the side - completely random, but a nice touch. My Americano was very rich and flavour and not at all bitter. 

There aren't very many tables near the front, but there's a back room and patio too. They also  host live music; open-mic nights; and art shows. They currently have an exhibit up of African photography but it rotates all the time. If you're looking for somewhere to watch the Royal Wedding, they'll be opening up at 6 for a tea and scone party - how cute is that? (\"pajamas optional\")."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the warm welcome and LOVE put into the food preparation here. it is one of those hidden GEM's off the main drag of Runnymede so it might be overlooked. In the back there is a Projector and screen for movies or booking for events like weddings or gallery shows. Also in the very back there is an outdoor Patio. I made a video of it"}
{"text":"I'm sure some fans of this place will immediately see the two star rating I've given it and gasp (and I was considering one star), however I'm basing this rating on the one thing that I walked in for, that being espresso.

I had ten minutes to kill at work, so after consulting Yelp for the closest cafe, I walked down the street to Reba's to get a shot. It looked promising online, boasting organic fair trade beans. Upon walking in, my eyes scanned the bar and my immediate reaction was to retrace my steps out the door when I saw the home (as in not professional) espresso machine. I didn't have time to go back to work and search out another cafe in this unfamiliar neighbourhood, so I decided to bear it, but not without suggesting first to the \"barista\" that the shop really needed to upgrade their machine as they weren't doing their lovely selection of beans any justice. His response was \"you'd be surprised\". I asked for a double shot. He loaded it up, ran a shot and was about to run a second blast of water through the same head with the same used grinds (ummm) when I quickly stopped him and said \"no, no, that will be fine\".

As any other espresso aficionado may have guessed, I was NOT surprised. As not to be insulting (I could have pulled a Badalamenti, Mulholland drive performance http://movieclips.com/y5A6-mulholland-dr-movie-bad-coffee/ ) I drank my glorified drip coffee and paid up with another \"cafe\" crossed off in my mental notebook. If you're looking for a good shot, look elsewhere.

It's a shame that this place has to do so poorly in this area because everything else seemed great about it. The food looked good, the wholesale beans looked good, the rooms looked good (the reasons I gave two stars instead of one). The bottom line is that If you're going to have the word \"cafe\" in your name (a European term, and in Europe coffee=espresso) then I think you should have your espresso game honed. At least buy a professional machine and have some concept of what a good shot looks like."}
{"text":"Reba's Cafe offers a truly excellent scone!  I watched the royal wedding here and it was a great experience.  It's a clean, bright, homey place with good food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"What a cute and friendly place. It's run by a couple, named after a dog, and serves healthy food. Felt like I was eating at someone's home. Had a breakfast without meat - which normally would make me pull a wtf - but was lovely. Felt great after that. Non greasy egg, fruit and veg, some coleslaw. They make treats there, too. The richest one I had was the butter-tart muffin. It was a muffin that tasted like a butter-tart. 

This is one of those places you go to and hope other people appreciate the charm and bring their business there. Was empty when I dropped in - but it's been open for a few years so let's assume it's got dedicated customers. I still think you should probably go for a nice long stroll in the Junction and check it out."}
{"text":"Owners Paul and Arlene swear they just work at Reba's Cafe. The real boss is their dog (Reba, of course) who's ready to greet customers at the door. 

A dog owner is suitable really because this little cafe has a lazy dog sort of attitude that's easy to fall in love with.

They serve all sorts of sweet treats (including these FANTASTIC squares that are clustery-gooey-nutty and delicious), coffee, tea and sandwiches.

Actually, while I was there (drinking my chamomile tea out of a big mason jar mug) three regular customers stopped in for bagel sandwiches that looked super tasty. The casual atmosphere, rather than the coldness of a Starbucks, allowed for easy conversation. 

The cafe also has a back room which has housed book launches, readings, and music shows, with many more plans in the works. The cafe also exhibits art work from local artists. Oh, and free WiFi. 

All in all, this is a great place to meet some friendly people, eat some simple but great food and pet a super sweet dog."}
