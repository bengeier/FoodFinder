{"text":"Love this place (even though it is a Nebraska bar -- Go Hawks!) The outside looks like a total dive bar but it's really nice for a south Scottsdale bar!  Lots of TVs, lots of seating & parking, food and food specials are pretty good.  Met up with friends there a few times now to watch football and always have a good time!  Bonus for me...I can walk to it!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I gave this place one star because they have so many beers on tap. Great selection too.  Now, the food was a grade above dog food and the service was awful. We stopped in here to watch the finals and our first server told us she did not want to repeat the beer list cause \"there were so many\". Last I checked, if you work at a bar and your customer asks what kind of beer you serve, you answer cause thats your job. Would it make it easier on you if we just got up ourselves and checked? I mean come on. This server wanted to close out, so we had another chick come over, one who was more concerned with telling us how it was almost her last shift and she was moving back home than providing good service. She was not the sharpest tool in the box either.  Either way, I spend my money at places I enjoy, food and service are important. I can go anywhere in this town to get beers on tap. Needless to say, I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my visit. I love dive bars and believe in supporting them however I can't support crappy service. I've tried this bar on four different occasions and not one had been enjoyable."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when I walked in the door. My friend and I were driving around looking for a bar to get some food and beer. By chance we passed by and decided to stop in. I was very surprised at the number of TVs going on in the joint.. The place had a decent number of tables and a good selection of bar games. As I passed the bar I did notice that they had a large selection of draft beers on tap and in bottles. This place is getting better by the moment. Now for the food. The prices were pretty good and we ordered the wings (naturally). We wanted to try four different flavors so we ordered 48 pieces for $24.99 and got nuclear, hot, lemon pepper and sweet chili. They we all good, but not spectacular. Overall I would come back to try more of their food and to hang out to watch a game. I would have given them a 4 star but the service was on the slow side. I will stop in again to see if it was just a bump in the road."}
{"text":"Always have good service even when busy Nebraska cornhusker games are being shown. good atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"The burgers are okay and the mac and cheese is below average. Worth going tho to watch a game because it won't be as crowded as other options."}
{"text":"Came here for the Nebraska game.  Great environment for that but the food and drinks were not good. I got the special buffalo burger with fries and a beer.  Took an hour to get. I understand it's game day and busy. We always go out for game day and understand what to expect. This was our first time going out for a Nebraska game in Arizona. My gf got the chicken burger. My beer was warm and flat.  Nothing like a warm coors light. The chicken sandwich was suppose to have avocado. Didn't have any.  Bacon burnt to the crisp.  And chicken dry as can be. They did take it off but no one apologized or anything. The waitress said \"okay\" and walked away after I said my gf sandwich isn't good. Took another 40 min to get a vodka and cranberry. And then we orders 3 shots took another 30 min.  People around us said yeah we eat before we come cause the food has never been good.  And 2 others complained they didn't get their blue moon and when they did it was also warm as can be.."}
{"text":"Uh...yeah. There's potential here, but it appears the owners are either too broke, too cheap or don't care enough to make some needed changes.  I've been going to Max's for several years now and here are my conclusions -   First, the positives: TV's! It's obvious the majority of their money goes to offering just about any sports event possible on dozens of tv's throughout the bar. The wide open layout makes it even better to simultaneously watch multiple games. Great advantage on game days.  Also, free poker tournaments twice a week for those who like to gamble without losing your shirt. Usually a fun (and diverse) group of people. They improved the patio for hanging outside (and smokers).  The negatives: Food is typical low end bar food. Lots of frozen and fried choices. I've tried a majority of the menu over time and nothing has ever stuck out. Wait staff, though friendly, seems inexperienced and often (not their fault) overwhelmed. Based on several experiences of both friends and my own, ownership (or management) is not big on customer service based on the following: Wait staff is very fearful to comp anything if there are problems. Spilled drinks...you're on your own. Don't like the food? Oh well.  I once went to restroom and server took my 1/2 full beer away. OK, fine. But to get a replacement drink, I was made to feel like it was a special circumstance and I was lucky to get it. Wow...really? Also, summertime patio. Great new mister and fan system put up outside but took about a month to fix when it broke. (server told us it was broke). Air-conditioning in part of bar is broke and has been for months. Uh...owners? It's Phoenix hot out there! Also, mixed drinks are weaker than most other Scottsdale bars. Let's see...OMG, the bathrooms. Nasty. The women's room has a perpetual stench of a sewer line that never goes away. They (bathrooms) just always seem dirty.  Overall bar itself smells like a dive bar should, I guess.  I enjoy going to Max's for the people I go with and sports on TV...but not for the bar itself."}
{"text":"This place is the equilvalent of a grown-up Chuck E. Cheese.... It is loud & there are huge TV's everywhere. The food is reasonably priced and pretty good. I would eat it again. Just not often. We went there for a birthday party and it was really hard to hear anything people were saying, even the people sitting right next to you. I'd have given it 4 stars for the food and prices except that it was just too loud and chaotic there for me. There were about 10 games going on at once on the TV's. Plus, there were pool tables, pingpong, and trivia. With all the of people talking and the music and the games, it was just too much! I wouldnt hang out their all the time but fun once in a while. Oh, The lunch specials are an excellent deal and even come with a beer! How cool is that!?! A free beer with lunch? Awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour on a Monday and the place was dead, which was ideal for us as we walked over to use the ping pong table and grab a couple cheap pints! This place is pleasantly clean and the bartender was very nice and served our pints in frosty glass. There is a decent happy hour daily, including deals on the weekend. We  ordered the boneless wings and fries from the happy hour menu for under $5. The fries were delicious! We were very satisfied in sipping our beers and playing round after round of ping pong without any problems."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT sports bar. The people are friendly and the owners and staff are awesome , kinda like Cheers. They have the best selection of Hi DEF LCD TVs in Arizona. They also have Sound Dawgs (personal speakers) that you can take to your table side just in case your game isn't on the loud speakers. The beer is ice cold( that frosty mug sensation), I love cold beer on tap!!!. I live around the corner so I know allot of the locals, really nice people and very laid back. Friday and Saturdays nights are pretty cool to hang out drink beer, listen to music, and bullshit with people. Now that they don't have karaoke on the weekends the place has gotten allot better (Some of those people couldn't sing worth a F#%$, they sounded like they were in the first week in a season of America Idol)!!! I like to start my night off at Max's get something to drink and catch a good buzz then take a cab to a club then end up back at the MAX to polish off the night. They have a couple of pool tables and ping pong (come play beer pong). This is the kinda of place that you can come in with a crowd of people or walk in by yourself and still have a good time. I LOVE THIS BAR!!    Yours truly,   A very loyal beer drinking customer."}
{"text":"Usually we love this bar. It's close to our house, never really busy and good priced. We came for the big fight the past weekend and paid $25 to get in. Not a huge deal,  that's honestly cheaper than other bars were charging. What bothered us was that we paid $25 to have the worst service ever! This bartender was soo rude to everyone she came in contact with. She clearly hates her job and took it out in all of the customers that ordered a drink from her. From what I heard from others around us is that she is the owners daughter..not sure if this is true but if so,  he is doing his bar no good by having her work there. We will definitely be back,  but if we walk in and see that face, we won't stay."}
{"text":"This bar has so many TVs and lots of seating! I went to watch the Ravens game here on Sunday and when we walked in, we were literally the only people there. I think this was because the PF Chang's Marathon was just finishing up and they had the road blocked off still.  Anyways, the waitstaff was nice and attentive (although it may have been because we were the only ones in there). I got a bloody mary and the veggie omelet. The bloody mary was really good and during games, they are only $2.50! The veggie omelet was decent, pretty typical bar brunch food.  They have good \"during game\" specials, and with so many large flat screen TVs, you could watch any game. I also noticed that it is a Nebraska bar for any Husker fans."}
{"text":"I invented the red roller tonight while I was at Max's.  It is a red beer made with Rolling Rock and their delicious Bloody Mary Mix.  Fantastic start to the night with the awesome day time bartender while sitting at the bar with a few coworkers.  However once the crowd arrived after 6 pm our large group of 10+ moved from the bar to an open table.  Our service rapidly deteriorated from that point.  The blonder server in the purple top whose name I did not get started off a bit slow but then gradually decreased her level of service to the point that we had to go to the bar to get new drinks.  I waited over 30 minutes to get my tab before I had to google the phone number of the bar and call and ask the bartender for my tab.  She said she would immediately send the waitress over which took another 10 minutes.  The kicker was that my coworker who wasn't leaving was still ignored during this process and did not receive another drink.  I come in here regularly with my coworkers during their great lunch and receive great service from the day time waitress so tonight was definitely unexpected.  Fortunately he daytime waitress was there and apologized profusely to us as she she saw the abhorrent service we were receiving.  She even bought our table a round of jello shots which she did not have to do.  Although this gesture doesn't make up for the horrendous service this morning evening, I will continue to be a regular lunch customer however any after work engagements with large groups will more than likely occur at the plethora of other establishments in Scottsdale who cater to large groups."}
{"text":"There was a very bad odor entering bar. It smelled like mold or something to that effect and that was the first problem. They also claim to have a new menu, but what they really need to do is get a new cook. They have one person back there trying to handle orders for the whole bar which wasn't that crowded for Monday football. It is the same cook that has always been there and he just doesn't know how to cook. This is an asian owned sports bar, but they only have one asian dish - why not add a few more and see what works. The beer prices are very low still ($2.25) for a bottle or draft, so that is the saving grace and the TV's are large and plentiful, but they need to freshen up that smell before I will return."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or UFC fight. Food's ok, service takes awhile."}
{"text":"Average sports bar. The food is decent and they have a lot of TV's for the every sports fan."}
{"text":"Many tv's in this sports bar, but ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND OFFENSIVELY OVERPRICED FOOD.  The chicken sandwich was just terrible! the bun was the cheap \"great value\" brand that you would find at wal-mart. The chicken was processed low quality chicken. The french fries were discusting, To top it all off, I paid 10$ FOR THIS PIECE OF SHIT CHICKEN SANDWICH. Also, for UFC event's there is a 5$ cover. So many other places to go nearby where there is no cover.  There are plenty of other sports bar's in scottsdale that are much better than this bar. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go watch a game. It gets really packed for important games like tonight. We had to wait a while just to find a place for us to sit. The food is typical bar food. Nothing terribly exciting but it soaks up the liquor. The drinks seemed to be overpriced, in my opinion. The service was alright. One of the bartenders was cute but some of the rest of the girls aren't. They have a ton of different beers on tap to choose from. Like I said, I'd go back here to watch a game but not for much else."}
{"text":"Been in a few times, because it's close to my house. Service is spotty. Food is mediocre, and probably designed to be more enjoyable the drunker you are. My friend and I won the trivia game thing one night (the trivial girl totally came up and interrupted our conversation to tell us about it - we weren't ostensibly there for that). So, t-girl comes up and hands us the big $25 gift card for the brainiac winners, and I say, \"Looks like we're the smartest guys in the joint,\" like...not-so-serious, but in a playful way, to which she gives the most condescending look, and replies, \"I don't know about that,\" all straight-faced, turning away robotically. Wow. Creepy. Yeah, you don't know me, or the art of conversation, girlfriend. I could clean up on Jeopardy, but since you interrupted...okay, I'll play your little game. And get comped food and drinks for me and my friend in the process. Boo-yah!  Anyway, my buddy gets the beef tacos and swears by them. I guess they have a couple of okay appetizers not designed for Epicurean appreciation, but for wolfing down while you're watching the Suns game.  There's your Max Sports Grille trivia in a nutshell!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! One of the best sports bars in Old Town Scottsdale. Lots of TV's. Ask about their FAMOUS jello shots!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for recovery because it's dark and close to home. FYI major Cornhusker bar. Max is great for watching football because the bar setup pretty much doesn't leave room for any bad seats. The amount of TV in here is enough to make you think someone went on a Best Buy heist. I do like that everyone is a true sports fan meaning no jerks being pro their team. We just love football. Drinks are cheap during football specials like $3 Bloodys. Food was meh and it seems the you-call-it-price is $10. Everything is in that price range! Service is pretty quick given the craziness during football season. With that said, don't drink from anything glass...water, beer. OMG. It smells like cat piss and someone used the same dirty dish rag. NOT A FAN!"}
{"text":"We used to go here when it was Famous Sams  and it was tolerable.  Then we made the BIG mistake of going here when it became Max.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I will not be going back here.  Famous Sam's was like that uncle you could tolerate because you could always rely on him to make you laugh with a joke full of words you probably shouldn't  be hearing.  Max is like the uncle in the corner that smelled kinda like he crapped his pants and never remembered to put his teeth in.  Just look away and pretend it doesn't exist!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and play pool or ping pong.  It wasn't crowded on a Friday night at 8pm so that is a huge plus.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice.  I like that they have an outdoor patio too."}
{"text":"\"They've got PBR on tap!!!\" Damn, I had no idea it was that easy to please my Scottsdale friend who apparently likes going low class as much as a bulimic Portland hipster.  \"We've gotta hang out more often if thats all it takes for you to have a good time,\" I told him. \"What's it called?\"  \"Something with Max. Max's Revenge. The maxx. Total Max. MAX POWER.\"  \"MAX POWER.\"  \"Yeah, MAX POWER. Let's do it. They've got PBR on tap!!!\"  As well as pretty much everything that goes with PBR. 4 dollar lunch specials with a beer, poker tournaments, internet poker dealies, casino style seating, and of course MULLETS! It was such a mullet fest I couldn't stop laughing in spite of all the assanine Patriots fans making sports observations that make Dan Dierdorf look like a Rhodes Scholar. And the tuck rule?!? We really gotta bring up the tuck rule? It was the sixth anniversary of those divisional playoffs and all, but please spare me the pain while I'm trying to enjoy the post-season despite another 4-12 Raiders finish.  I'm off track. Back to the mullets. I first noticed it when a couple, dressed in what is likely their Saturday night best leather, took over one of the pool tables. As the female partner flashed her curly, blond locks during shots, I commented at how I guess the good part of having a girlfriend with a mullet is you can take her to a sports bar on a Saturday night for some free pool and poker and she will think that they are royalty.  But surely mullets and PBR don't equal four stars Mike, is what you are likely saying. It doesn't. It's the huge fleet of HD flat screens that really make this place. They really do multiple-game viewing right at this place with all large flat screen TVs lining the walls and plenty of comfortable seats in the center to watch them from.   They also have a huge selection of draft beers the runs almost the entire length of their bar. Domestic 25 oz beers ran around 4 dollars. \"They've got PBR!!!\" Alright Jason, I get it, but I'll have a Stella. Those ran 7 dollars for the 25 oz variety.  Top it off with all the free pool and ping pong you can co-ordiante yourself through after 25 oz beers and some mixed NFL playoffs/Phoenix Suns action.   \"We really should've played ping pong before all that booze,\" I said breaking out in a sweat chasing after about my 30th errand ball.  \"Agreed.\""}
{"text":"The sewer smell when you walk in used to be pretty bad but since I've quit smoking, it's almost unbearable. Have you guys ever poured water down your floor drains in the bathrooms? Like 2-3 gallons. It should clear up the stench."}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good, lots of beers on tap and there were tons of TV's!  Came here once for football and once for UFC.  Enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This used to be our hangout of choice for UFC fights but the owner would lay down a table next to the restroom entrance if he could manage it. The service is atrocious. The food is decent. Avoid this place if you have other places to watch UFC"}
{"text":"Good service, excellent set-up for TV viewing... Food is mediocre, but all-in-all there are few places in the Old Town vicinity that are better in terms of mass sports consumption."}
{"text":"Obviously the waitress/ bartender hates her job and life JOY (nickname) last night was rude as hell. This was our first time we were looking to really drink and enjoy ourselves but she killed the mood. And she told us she hated the music we chose on TouchTunes there was literally 1 person in there when we arrived. Her attitude alone will kill this place. Never again will come to this place. Especially with someone like her working there. She didn't even greet us when we walked in no hi nothing what a sham this place could a gold mine for the owners lots of tvs and pool tables."}
{"text":"I live close and always watch Pay per view fights here. I like the food and everyone that works there, except one blonde waitress that refuses to ask if we want anything. Weather its full or empty she is to busy to help. I don't even care, I just go to the bar while I'm using the restroom(small bladder). I just find it strange. You would think she would want to make money since she is walking around anyway. Oh well..."}
{"text":"GO BIG RED ! ! ! !  We watch every Huskers game here.   Lots of TV, great beer selection and good food."}
{"text":"TONS of tvs  ,individual speakers  with headphone. Food fair , weekend breakfast awful. Nebraska football bar. Good beer selection. It was dead and we wanted outrgame on big tv waitress refused even though no else was watching the big TV."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar/restaurant with your standard fare of philly cheesesteaks, fried appetizers, burgers etc.   Friendly service and TV's covering every inch of the walls. Don't expect anything fancy, but its a great place to spend a few hours and watch the game with friends."}
{"text":"Fairly unimpressive but we have fun at Thursday night trivia. They definitely have some tasty appetizers but for the most part just good ole bar food. Lots of TVs and it's nice that it's so close to our place."}
{"text":"Great clean large sports bar great for game day-with all the TV's to choose from you'll never miss a game especially Huskers and Packers!!   No matter where you sit you're surrounded by TVs.  Great bar food plus they have cheese curds .  Great friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Been here for work get togethers the past few weeks. There was more than enough room for our group of 50+ people. We played pool and table tennis and enjoyed the patio. The drinks are cheap and the food is average. Spacious and good lighting."}
{"text":"We went to Max  last night to watch the Ravens playoff game.  They had a $5 cover charge due to a UFC fight.  Not interested and thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"Bright, huge, friendly, cheap! I have to admit I have a bias because any bar with a ping-pong table in it would have to work hard not to get 5 stars from me but it's easily 4 stars without the table. The food I've had is good and it's a very bright and cheery place. $2.75 for that pint of PBR, and I'd say at least 25 60\"+ plasma screens. Also they do UFC parties and Texas Hold 'Em on Sat. nights. Loved it and will keep goin back..."}
{"text":"SO MANY TVs. They also usually have good beer specials.   The food is so-so. The app sampler is AWFUL. Seriously don't get it. The reubens are not bad.  The atmosphere and friendly staff make up for the food."}
{"text":"Horrible service! food was cold! Beer was warm and took forever! Do not come to this bar!"}
{"text":"it's a sports bar,  they really should work on improving the food, but, HEY it's a sports bar -  50 TVs, and not a bad seat in the house.  really friendly people hang out here, mostly south Scottsdale locals; and the bar staff and waitrons are very friendly and good at their jobs, and attentive and unobtrusive if you are totally engaged in some football or basketball game, but as soon as you need another, they are right there. You can also borrow a radio to listen to the game while you watch, in case the audio for the game you're watching isn't being played on the speakers. Lynn is a Jewel - a really special person that should make a lot of money in tips because she is really really a great person.  I'm pretty sure her name is Lynn.  -------------------------- UPDATE - went there for the Bama-Clemson BCS championship game on Monday and had some excellent eggrolls; fresh made in their kitchen, not frozen crap from Sysco; didn't care for the sweet/hot pink dipping sauce and the waitron cheerfully brought me a cup of excellent teriyaki sauce. So I stayed and also had a good burger - actually cooked medium rare as I requested - and they have Stella Artois on tap.  Good times, fun crowd, except those thugs from Bama won the game"}
{"text":"Great patio for watching UFC fights. Slow service during UFC fights.    Food - run of the mill but it does its job during a UFC fight.  Thumbs down for changing the channel on one of the TVs  to a college basketball game that NO ONE appeared to be watching.  We were then told that the same TV was being viewed inside, and someone had requested it inside.  DOH.  But still, not cool to change it like that while others are totally into watching the fight outside, right?"}
{"text":"Discovered this dark sports den about 2 weeks ago, as they have a PING PONG TABLE! I just learned to actually play the game semi-respectably and after buying new paddle at Big 5, I was dying to show off my new moves.  The table is in fair to good condition but the green net needs a \"lift\" as it was pretty droopy, but that only helped my amateur status. My man and I volleyed for a good hour to hour and a half and ordered HH apps which were surprisingly tasty! We ordered the egg rolls, wings, and Mac-N-Cheese. All were winner-winners and we consumed every last crumb. Believe they were priced at $5/per app during HH hours.  Service was attentive and friendly. Ventilation was sub-par and I highly suspect the temp by ping-pong table was flirting with 80 degrees. But then again, I take my new sport very seriously and was moving quite a bit..."}
{"text":"Don't ever get the wings unless you like fried burnt dried boneless wings sprinkled with jarred garlic. Not only was the food terrible but the waitress was extremely rude. I will never be returning"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I will be here again. Why? It's that \"where should we go get a beer with the best chance of specials?\" bar. I have never been there when there wasn't some sort of special. Sometimes even a giveaway!  Wings are okay. I will leave it at that. Burgers also okay. Standard bar fare to soak up all the beer you will drink while watching one of 50 games on all their TVs.  They have a nice patio that is often full of smoking football fans. Also have cute and attentive bartenders. Usually very loud and rude married dudes hitting on them the whole time, which can be more fun than the games..."}
{"text":"Man I wish I still lived in Scottsdale right about now!  Max's is the best place in S. Scottsdale to watch NFL!  I'm sure it's probably just as good for NCAA, just getting into College football. They have the lil sound dog things, so that if your game isn't on the loud speaker, you can at least hear your game.  This was the first place I've been to with them, but the Native New Yorker in Laveen has them too, what a terrific little piece of technology.  This used to be a Famous Sams, and was bought out by a guy from California.  He came in, refinished the bar, added all the flat screens, a patio and I'm sure he got new bar stools!  Looks a million times better than the old Famous Sams!  BUT, they pretty much kept the famous sams food, so they lose stars on that!  BUT they have great NFL Sunday Specials, at least they did last season.  I always sat belly up, so I can't say much about service, but the bartenders are usually on their game!"}
{"text":"The actual bar is great! They have a TON of flat screen TVS, shuffle board and lots of seating. The service was... eh- ok. We got pizza and thought it was great!   Hopefully they hire some intelligent waitresses who are \"yes\"men instead of the answer no to every question. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Max Sports Grille is the perfect spot to catch a game and have a drink with some friends.  Just make sure you eat before arriving here.  Ordering food brings down the fun experience.  The bar itself is pretty cool and laid back.  The place is huge and flat screens virtually cover all the walls giving you a good view of whatever game you're there to see.  There's a lot of room inside and the patio looks like a good spot as well.  We came with a pretty big group and there were no problems accommodating us.  The tap selection is awesome and prices are pretty good.  Thursday night trivia is also a lot of fun if you are a person filled with worthless knowledge (such as myself).  As I already expressed, the sour note is the food.  While I rarely expect culinary excellence from a sports dive, not a single person in our group that ordered something to eat truly enjoyed our food.  It's okay for average bar food, but mostly plain and underwhelming.  If you're looking to eat more than drink, you may want to skip Max Sports Grille."}
{"text":"Bad service.... horrible service... I will never come back! Our waitress tried to charge us for things we didn't order. When I called her out on it, she flipped and threw our receipt at my wife. She came back with another receipt with two items taken off but still wrong... I ended up paying for it to avoid an issue. I have a broken leg and the way we were treated was the worst I've ever been treated anywhere. I will spread my experience all over social media and my pages. We have a food page with thousands of fans that will be reading about our horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Smell was bad. Walked in and was hit by a bleach/sewer smell. Bar was full with locals and sat at a makeshift center bartop facing 2 tv's. The waitress (blonde) was very nice. Bartendar was not. Had a couple drinks but couldnt get past the smell. I went back a second time the next day as I was staying at the Courtyard nearby. The second night it was a Friday and they were very busy. The same waitress was here and sat in her section. Drinks were good but the place was just average, and not really clean or appealing. i went to the restroom and decided enough was enough."}
{"text":"Wait! This is a bar???  That was my initial reaction after being taken here one night after I already had my buzz on.  I drive passed it everyday on my way to work and had always stupidly assumed, based on the sign, that this was a skate shop or something.  I do know that it seemed quite big inside, and it wasn't very busy.  I did like the fact that they have like 45 beers on tap (I\"m just guessing at that number.  Remember, I was buzzed).  But they do give you the option to have a beer flight, three 7 oz beers for a super cheap price that yes, I don't remember.  Either way, they were good and they had my favorite Leinenkugels (how do you spell that?) so my flight consisted of 2 of those.    The bartender was a really nice chick, and even gave us 2 lemons to take home, because we decided we needed those for some reason.    I think maybe I need to go again so I can fully immerse myself in the Max."}
{"text":"This place is fun for college football games. Big time Nebraska bar so lookout if you aren't a cornhusker. Good drinks and great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the ability to watch any game you want. It's also nice that they have great breakfast/lunch football specials."}
{"text":"This is seriously a great sports bar. It's a Nebraska Huskers bar on Saturdays and it's amazing. They play the fight song after every score and Duke, the owner, gets on the microphone and leads the cheers. Heck, even Bill Glassford, the 100 year old former Huskers coach (1949-1955) came in for the game!!  Great sound system  Brilliant TV layout except need one more TV so the short side of the bar right inside the front door can see a TV clearly.  Food was good...wish they had actual  hash browns instead of the chunks of potatoes.  Bloody Mary's should be served in a tall glass but are cheap ($3).  Gotta support mom and pop places. The owners are onsite and working hard."}
{"text":"Best place to watch a NE husker game in AZ!  they play the fight song after every TD, have tons of TVs so there is not a bad seat in the house. will definitely be making this my new husker football viewing locale!"}
{"text":"Amazing sports bar (tv are amazing) but the bartender has the personality of a rock. Granted it's only one bartender but this was my first impression. She sucked! Okay....I just had the chicken tacos. Don't come here! Bartender is an A-hole and the food is very low quality and tasteless."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar. The owners and staff are all terrific! They even make Thanksgiving Dinner for their customers every year. Awesome!!  Scott C. Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. If you're just going to watch a game and have some drinks, Max's is definitely a 4 star (maybe 5 star) place. There are over 50 TVs, and some of the booths even have their own TVs. You can also borrow a radio to listen to the game while you watch, in case the audio for the game you're watching isn't being played on the speakers. I didn't drink on my visit, but they seemed to have some pretty cheap drinks, especially considering it was football Sunday. It would also be a good place to go with a group, as there were quiet a few large groups there. Plus, they had a few pool tables, darts, and shuffleboard.  There was also fans from a variety of teams, so you don't have to worry about intruding on enemy territory if you're coming to watch NFL games.  If you're coming to have food, Max's is probably closer to 2-3 stars. I had the sliders, and although it was a pretty good sized serving, they were pretty dry and bland.The fries were okay, but not good enough to make up for the sliders. My dad and my boyfriend had the boneless wings. They looked like (and according to my boyfriend tasted like) they could have used more sauce.  At least our waitress was super attentive. Even when we finished our food and were just hanging out, she kept coming by to see how we were doing on drinks. She did give us the wrong check at the end, and I didn't realize it until after she swiped my card. Fortunately, it didn't make the bill too much more expensive, so I didn't bother complaining. You might want to double check your bill here before you present your card.  Overall, if you are looking to watch a game in the South Scottsdale area, and want to avoid the douchebagery of OldTown, Max's is probably your place."}
{"text":"This place has a great setup for watching sports and the food was great... but the service here is very slow.  Like if you want to order food, plan on waiting 30 - 45 minutes to see a server.  If you actually want to eat your food, plan on another 30 minutes... forget about them coming and asking how the food is or even taking your plate away.  I give them some credit that I went on one for the the busiest sports night; but you can tell they (Max's) were not prepared to manage this large capacity.   Overall, I only paid $16 for to large beers and two entrees... I'm sure all be back."}
{"text":"Max Sport Grille offers a great lunch menu where you can get a sandwich/burger with fries and a drink for $5-$7.  With tip, I can enjoy a full meal at a sit-down restaurant for under $10.  I like that they have trivia you can play, and there's usually some good sports to watch on the many televisions that surround you.  The food is decent.  The fries are really good.  They're the big, crispy seasoned kind.  Yum."}
{"text":"Great tv set up. Comfortable food. When the new owners took over and remodeled the inside, not sure why they didn't Change the kitchen, the food is a 2/10 at best. Great for all sports, food strongly not recommended."}
{"text":"I went here to watch football last Sunday.  I had the nachos and they weren't that good, but the TV setup was awesome, the seats were comfortable, the service was decent and there was hardly anyone in there! I will be back and try something else to eat."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time, maybe the last. The chicken fingers (really hard to do wrong) were horrible. They didnt really seem like chicken...sort of like a major fast food place's \"nuggets\". The green pork chile taco was better, but I am not sure we will be back. The bar itself seemed ok, but the food was not good."}
{"text":"My man Duke runs this establishment and I'll tell you what it's just straight up wild.    Imagine it's your first day at college in the mid-west.  You've got your backpack slung over one shoulder, your hair is slicked to the side and you're wearing your best outfit for all the ladies to see (Burberry recommended).    During your 1st day you meet a nice girl named Gizelle from the most \"interesting\" town ever.  You both start talking and everything she says is about how she's a writer, singer, dancer, free-spirit, \"student athlete\" who's majoring in politics of blah blah blah and whatever she can make up, just for the guy to go...\"whoa, me too.\"   Now at some point Gizelle decides to invite you to this get together she heard about because it's where all the students go to celebrate the big game.  You of course say, \"Yes!  I'll meet you there!\" (insert disbelief fist pump).   Now it's you're moment.  You head over there in your 2006 Mazda Hatchback that's the color White, because we all know that's a ride any girl wants to hop into, and you open the doors to a sea of red as fans are chanting Husker!...Power!   You begin to panic, \"Oh man am I at a cult?  Where a Gizelle?  Why did I bring my backpack with me?  What is this place?!\"  This my friends is called home.   They've got pitchers of the most fratboy like stuff, not that craft brew crap everyone seems to adore after college (eyeroll).  The wings are an assortment which vary from hot, spiced chili, bbq or my personal favorite; Radioactive.    Finally, if you don't know what a Shotski is then pull out your big boy pants, go hit on some babes (babes not always included, but it's pretty consistently included), go grab em out of their seats and enjoy the ritual we call Shotski.  You'll need 3 people (yourself included) for this ski that fits 3 shots from the left, middle & right.  Best part about this place is everyone is polite but when the Husker game is on, watch out!  So there you have it.  This review is for you Duke.  You're the man.    #HuskerPower"}
{"text":"The owner is awesome. His staff not so much. They obviously hate their jobs. So rude. And not just to me. To everyone. Insane."}
{"text":"What a nice looking bar tucked away in the suburbs of Phoenix. We went to play ping pong primarily and were very disappointed in their ball quality. They were those shitty soft plastic balls that barely bounce and get blown every where by the slightest breeze.  After our bad luck with the ping pong balls we turned to dart where we were once again let down when the server told us we had to provide our own balls because it was a professional quality dart board.   We gave up after that and settled for the T.V.s. There were plenty of those around and many games to choose from which is nice for watching sports. The food was amazing as well which must be the biggest draw from this place. Service was pretty retched as well. She had an attitude and didn't really put much effort into making us happy.   I'd say go here for watching sports and eating, but pass on the games."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game.  Good but not great food.  We held alumni events there, and they were always very generous with prizes and donations that supported our scholarship fund."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think from looking at it from the outside, but Max's is a sports fan wet dream on the inside.  TV's on top of TV's.Tons of beers on tap, they are always changing them out so you get to try new delicious beers.  I frequent here for lunch as they have an excellent lunch special.  5 bucks for an entree, fries/salad and a drink. . . . Can't beat it with a stick.   Shuffleboard table is hidden in the back with pool and ping pong, and I love me some Shuffleboard.    The owner is a big Nebraska fan, so they have huge viewing parties on Saturdays when they play.  It's a must stop for any sports fan."}
{"text":"This sports bar is the king of the lunch special. Good choices and good prices. My only complaint is that the service is slow. If you go for lunch expect your whole lunch hour to be sapped. But, the food is tasty, the drinks are cold, and the price is right."}
