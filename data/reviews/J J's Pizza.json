{"text":"Quick delivery. Tasty Pizza and wings. Budget price. We will call again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, solid price. The topping were great and fresh, the crust was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place!! The Stromboli with banana peppers is my fave. My sons like the chicken with white garlic sauce.  Great family run business!! Hardworking people with a delicious family recipe. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I live in Cleveland but this store is close to Cleveland so they deliver in my area. Good pizza, a wide variety on the menu and the price point is spot on. The pizza crust is fresh and the ingredients are fresh as well. I have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. It is fresh chicken and has a great flavor. One time the wrapper was on the dry side though. So next time I order I will mention that . I have had the chicken tenders and they were good as well. They offer a variety of sandwiches hot and cold, chicken wings, pasta dinners, desserts and of course pizza. The shrimp alfredo dinner was very good and had a nice flavor. The sauce was not on the thick side.  I had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. I have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth.  The deliveries are very quick. I went to the actual store and it was clean and I watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. They are always friendly and polite. The store is located off Lorain Road closer to the Fairview Bridge and Kamn's Corner area.  There is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want."}
{"text":"Our office orders pizza from this place all the time. We love the pizza, salads and subs. Great prices, diverse menu. Their sauce is delicious. And the owners are very friendly. Couldn't ask for better or more from your neighborhood pizza joint!! Keep up the Good work JJ's!!!"}
{"text":"That's a solid pizza!  It was my first time here and the dough tasted home made and the sauce was very \"tomato-y\". It tastes also home made to me. Not over-seasoned like pizza sauces sometimes do.  I love it when the sauce has a very intense tomato flavor. I really liked it! The dough is somewhere between a thin crust and a little bit \"doughier\". So it's not a very crispy crust but as I said - it tastes home made to me. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Our go to place for sheet pizzas and take out.  Friendly and accommodationing.  Quality each time, rare to find a non chain pizza place that nails it each time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best family owned pizza shop in the area. It's a bit more expensive then chains, but that's because it's family owned and you get quality. If you get a deluxe pizza, usually the dough is all soggy and greasy. Not at all here. They have more than just pizza. Their wings are great, salads as well as garlic bread. You know how most pizzas never have enough cheese? Not here. They're not shy with toppings. I love eating cold pizza and you can eat this cold as well. They also have soda and chips and subs.  They deliver and you can pick up. There is no eating place inside here. When you call and order, ask for specials. There is always a special."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a bit of a pizza aficionado but I'm probably just a fat boy who loves pizza. Simply put, I eat pizza. A lot of pizza. I stumbled upon JJ's while picking up some booze from the liquor store next door (beer, liquor, pizza...one stop shopping). I already had dinner but I like pizza so I had to give them a shot. I had one little pocket of room left in my belly so I ordered a small pep + cheese. Man, oh man, so good! I can't imagine if I went there on an empty stomach. It would have full-on smorgasbord. As far as the pizza goes, excellent balance of dough, sauce and cheese. And all the ingredients were high quality (and offered at a very reasonable price). The sauce was slightly sweet but robust. The cheese was melted to perfection and delicious. The dough was in the bullseye of being just enough crispy and just enough chewy. In addition to the quality product, the fine folks at JJ's were incredibly friendly and attentive to their customer and product. I highly recommend JJ's and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time trying it. We ordered a variety of things to try. Hawaiian, supreme  pizza and Stromboli were delicious but we weren't too fond of the garlic parmesan wings.  Ordered extra crispy, but they were not done enough for our liking."}
