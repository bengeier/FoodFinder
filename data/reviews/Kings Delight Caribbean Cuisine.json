{"text":"I actually love this place, they have awesome fry chicken and great deals. The place is always busy, I love their coleslaw. My problem is that when my boyfriend buys the 5 dollar chicken he gets 3 large good pieces of chicken and a juice.... When I do I get 2 pieces OR 2 legs and a chicken back! AND I have to ask for my juice! Not cool! You should encourage other ethnicities to visit your restaurant and stop the ignorance."}
{"text":"This is place is the best. Me and my family always go here whenever nobody wants to cook. The price for the combo is more then affordable and for the portion of food you get you can't go wrong. Some places give you big portions of alright food but this place gives you a top quality home made Caribbean dish. The service is good and quick. You'll always hit a line up but don't expect to wait longer then 10 minutes. Foods always fresh. I recommended the BBQ chicken combo or jerk chicken combo (5 bucks)"}
{"text":"Kings Delight deserves to win the Nobel Prize in Jerk Chicken. I'm a local. I eat here often. But to every true Yelpers (yes, I'm calling you out) should take time out of their day and try Kings Delight.   KD is tiny. They do take out and offers seating for 10. But don't expect to sit because the line up is right to the exit. The food here is always fresh and it is jammed packed with flavour. They're chicken is very tender and moist, and you'll never have chicken this tender.  They offer chicken in variations, but jerk, fried, bbq, stewed, curry chicken is offered daily. Ox tail is a must try. Reoccurring specials also include chicken foot soup, fish and more. My favourite dish would be jerk chicken, rice and peas, ox tail gravy, coleslaw (also to die for).  Don't be alarmed when your bill comes out to be $3, tax included. No, it wasn't a typo. A small portion cost $3 and can feed the small sized adult. What is mind blowing is that quality is not sacrificed in this low priced joint.  Bow to the King."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch special today. $3 for a small portion of chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw. $5 for a medium. Excellent value, very tasty chicken and a nice authentic char."}
{"text":"Tried their jerk chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw; all tasted great! The lunch portion box was only $5 and you get a bottle of juice with it. They also don't charge tax here! Amazing deals. The only downside to this place is that the employees need to smile! Everyone seems so serious here, which can create an unfriendly environment. Though, main reason people come here is for the food anyways!"}
{"text":"Stopped by around noon to try their jerk chicken. Upon entering, there were about 4 people in line ahead of me, most of them opting for the amazing $5 deal (BBQ, fried or jerk with tice and peas, coleslaw). The service is a bit slow but it's because they know that their customers are willing to wait. I got the jerk chicken with oxtail gravy and the lady serving me was super nice. What surprised me the most was when I turned to leave, the line up was right to the door - with more customers on their way in!  As for the chicken, it was succulent, fall off the bone and well seasoned with just the right amount of kick. I just wish the coleslaw had more time to sit, but with that amount of customers, I can't really blame them. Well worth it for $5."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food I've ever had. Chicken is a fall off bone, well seasoned. Yes the line up is long, but it is worth it. The parking lot is hard to park in (small)."}
{"text":"I had the Saturday special, stew chicken with rice and peas ( or maybe you say beans) and coleslaw, for $5. The portions are generous and the food is tasty! Service is well organized, and once you've placed your order, you don't have to wait long to get it!"}
