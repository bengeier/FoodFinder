{"text":"I don't quite understand the reason for the not-so-great reviews. I really enjoyed my lunch there right now. An order of Tacos Al Pastor and an Agua de Jamaica... both very good. I liked the consistency of the soft tacos a lot and found the grilled pork on the tacos very flavourful and tender. The tacos were topped with grilled (?) pineapple, which worked really well with the medium salsa and the  bottled Valentina hot sauce. Really enjoy my meal.  The restaurant now has a portable AC, which works alright. I imagine it may be a bit on the warm side on a rally hot day."}
{"text":"I walk past this place all the time and it always seems fairly busy so I added it to my list of neighbourhood places to try. The service was friendly enough, and I liked that our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. She answered all of our questions with ease. We ordered the guacamole, four al pastor tacos, and a chicken burrito. Unfortunately I have to agree with the other reviewers who commented that the food was bland. The guacamole was so tasteless, I can only describe it as boring. The chicken burrito was okay once we added more salt, hot sauce and salsa to it.  The tacos were the best thing we ate. I liked the addition of pineapple to it.  I love tacos and burritos, so I will give this spot another try in hopes that the second time around is better."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and beef tacos first time out. Beef was fine, however the chicken was, to repeat a word found in a few reviews here: bland.  Always one to give second chances, I went back for the tacos Al Pastor and...they were just ok.  I ordered four of them, went to the park and 20 or 30 minutes later, I just felt hungry again.  If I'm going to shell out $10 on a meal it has to at least one of two requirements: taste like heaven (total miss here) or kill my appetite dead (I bought a sandwich an hour later). I can forgive one but not both.  Growing pains?"}
{"text":"UPDATE: since my last visit in december 2016 they have improved the amount of staff and are open on sundays now. Also, you can now get a table as they have more and also lots of stools in the bar area. They have added more tacos to the menu which I think was a great decision considering they are very yummy!!! Best tacos of it's type I have had in Toronto,  very very close to the real deal, forget about the kensington gringo tacos that torontonian's have been convinced to believe it is how it should taste like, give this place a try and you won't regret it !!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed quick bite.  So delighted to find a tacqueria.  Ordered an al pastor burrito and margarita during lunch time because why not.  The magarita was not weak do quite good and the burrito was bursting with flavor.  The poblano and onions were charred to perfection.   Glad i stumbled here"}
{"text":"Really great and very authentic. Squash flower quesadillas were much the same as the ones we had in Oaxaca, and the al pastor tacos also delicious. Super nice and fast service, no liquor licence but tasty drinks - the jamacia one was great."}
{"text":"I went there Saturday and the food could've been better. I hate the fact when you're eating they go around to see if you're done. Only thing positive was the customer service from the asian girl who was taking my order she was very informative and smiles a lot. I wish your food wasn't so average. Wont be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was very excited about this place since the neighbourhood doesn't have much fast food besides Subway and Cut the Cheese.  Decor is great, service is friendly, but the tacos were only so-so.  Most of the flavour came from the veggies and the salsa. The meat itself was barely noticeable.  The beef brisket tacos had some kind of sausage chunks mixed in.  Price-wise, way too much.  I spent $18 on 2 chicken, 2 beef tacos, and a drink. That's restaurant prices in a takeout place.  If you buy the Al Pastor tacos, it's 4 for $10 or one for $3.50.  All the other tacos are $3.50, but there's no combo deal for them.  That's just plain illogical.  Going to Cantina across the street would've been only a few bucks more.  But the staff was great and the management seemed nice.  I really do hope they turn it around.  I'll give it another try in 6 months."}
{"text":"Very average. I tried all four tacos and they were bland and flavorless. My wife had the veggie burrito, they forgot to put the guacamole in it. It was also quite bland. Hopefully it's just growing pains, but I won't be going back any time soon.   As others have mentioned, the portions are tiny for the price."}
{"text":"Had the Volcano Tacos today. Taco-licious. Lots of toppings, all hot and fresh. Homemade hot sauce had just the right bite. Limonada had a great balance. Staff was super nice. Excellent value as well. Would like to go back and try some more items off the menu."}
{"text":"If you want rice in your overflowing so-called burrito, go somewhere else. If you want authentic Mexican tacos and burritos, come to this place. I had the tacos al pastor and tacos de tinga; both were delicious. The totopos (chips) were authentic, not that pre-made baked crap that they serve in some other places. Good selection of drinks (the agua de jamaica was refreshing and not too sweet). Our son devoured his choriqueso. Good place to get your Mexican fix."}
{"text":"omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok so like I went to the junction fest last summer and decided to go to al pastor. I had never had like REAL Mexican food just like chipotle and all. I ordered a burrito thinking it would be the tex mex rap i was used to. turns out it is a big plate of food ( mushrooms, beef, pineapple)  and a pile of 8 or so small tortillas to eat it with.  all in all: yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple here folks. I paid Al Pastor in the Junction a visit during one of the Junction street festivals this summer. For the weekend the business obtained a temporary liquor license so we were fortunate to have the full experience while others may have not.  We ordered the guac and chips (obviously) and I had an excessive amount of Sangria (two of their largest) served in a large mason jar. Once it was time to eat I decided to forego the tacos and ordered their special burrito.   The burrito appeared to be small-ish but it was actually jam packed with filling and stuffed to its full capacity. And it was delicious!  Looking forward to coming back and I think if you read some of the earlier nay-sayers reviews, it's time to pay them a visit and make a decision for yourself. I think they're worth the visit!  Earcrest Out"}
{"text":"Its veryvery so so so...the wait is sooo long and i know it doesnt take that much to make tacos, the place wasnt packed. I think tacos were just dry and so little meat! The burrito was good but i didnt see any meat in it. Will never come back."}
{"text":"THE WORST...ON EVERY LEVEL. Waited forever (25 minutes for a drink), out of many items including tortilla chips (AT A MEXICAN RESTAURANT??). They can give you guac though...I guess you eat it with a spoon??? Cocktails were subpar at best, but the tacos might have been the worst food experience Ive ever had. I love food and especially eating food - I took a bite of one of the tacos, while suffering extreme hanger, and threw it back down...I DON'T TREAT FOOD THAT WAY!!! THE WORST"}
{"text":"Ok. I really shouldn't be writing a review based only on the one thing I got off the menu... Chips & Guac, but I JUST HAVE TO!  Man, this place gives you such a HUGE portion of guacamole, it's insane! Although a bit on the pricey side ($8), they really give you a bigger portion than most restaurants give you, so in a sense, you really are getting your moneys worth. It's delicious, it's creamy, it's light; it's everything, with just the perfect touch of acidity.   Love it. Love it. Love it."}
{"text":"The portions are small and the food is bland. On the bright side, the service is really friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Excellent Taco Shop renovated new beautiful clean kitchen you can see your food being cooked which is awesome quality Mexican food just like the stuff Df. m√©xico"}
{"text":"This was a real find. After rudely being told by the Mexican down the road that you could never get in on a Saturday night without a reservation, we continued our stroll and discovered this place. The staff was very welcoming, the drinks menu was unique and the tacos.. We couldn't decide what to eat as it all sounded good. They are small but delicious. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I waited to leave a review on this place after my 2nd trip as I really wanted it to be part of my portfolio of go to Mexican food joints in my vicinity.  Unfortunately, my 2nd trip was consistent with the 1st.  On my 1st try, i ordered the 'Al Pastor' Tacos.  When they came out, i was pretty shocked how little content each shell had.  It was finger food.  But, it doesn't matter if the food tastes great.  And in this case, it didn't.  The meat was so tasteless and bland.  The key to a good taco is the flavour of the meat to offset the texture centric shell and the fresh veggies.  The shell was a typical shell.  And the veggies seemed fresh.  But again, the meat lacked any seasoning (even salt and pepper) never mind any kind of braising or marinating.  I was also disappointed in the salsa sides.  They scored well in freshness, but also lacked taste (probably seasoning).   The 2nd time I went, i ordered the steak burrito.  And NO, I DO NOT like rice in my burritos or most places that offer such products.  I think the burrito was worse then the tacos.  Firstly, the steak was bland yet again.  No seasoning.  The heat and water from the pepper and onions, melted the cheese into oblivion and made the burrito soggy like eating a tasteless soup.  Having a soggy, tasteless burrito is probably the worst type of burrito you could have.  It was again, quite small for $10.   I'm really disappointed in this place as it's in my hood.  And also, the decor is very inviting.  I like the decor and seating.  Service is fine.  I can forgive the portion size, but man, the lack of flavour will stop me from coming there a third time."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience here, I tried to call when they gave me the incorrect order and they did not answer. After returning the order they made by mistake they remade it and made another mistake. I could not be bothered to return it a second time. Instead, I emailed the contact email about my poor experience and was ignored."}
{"text":"Service was great. Breaded fish taco was okay, especially for five dollars. The cactus one was almost tasteless. Not licensed yet. Cucumber lime juice tasted exactly like that so looking forward to when they get beer."}
{"text":"We just showed up for lunch. Their website says they open at 12 which is when we showed up. The owner/manager said they weren't opening until 12:30 that day... (Would have been nice to know given our group of 9) when he saw the size of the group he told us they can get it going and to wait 10 minutes. They didn't seat us - they left us on the sidewalk...we awkwardly made our way in. In short, they didn't even take our order until 1.5 hours later. A quick taco turned into a 2 hour affair. Tacos were dry, tortillas were dry, the bills took forever, the bills were printed out wrong and on top of that they dinged us a mandatory 18% for gratituity...they probably do this because otherwise they'd get nothing. Awful experience. They weren't even sympathetic."}
{"text":"I don't know why the rating for this place is so low.  The tacos Al Pastor are amazing and I get them every time I come.  They're definitely not as big as I'd like them to be, but the amount of flavour makes up for lack in size!"}
{"text":"The guacamole looks and tastes like it came out of a bag from the grocery store. Very bland and not nearly enough chips to go with it.   Service was OK but really slow and it took too long to flag down our waitress because they seem short-staffed. The food is greasy and flavourless and portions are small. The atmosphere is threadbare and dark.   The watermelon mint drink was nice but warm which meant it wasn't as refreshing as it could be. Very unsatisfying. I managed to spend $50 here and regret it.   You're much better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch after the High Park Spring run off. I was hungry but not starving having had my post-race banana and power bar an hour or so before. I will simply say this-  the best shrimp tacos I've ever had! 100 times better than the deep fried shrimp atop some kind of coleslaw that is typical.  This was a perfect little creation: 3 grilled shrimp adorned with fresh pieces of avocado and a spicy dollop of red sauce/salsa. I will have 4 of those when I come back here for dinner. At $5 a piece it would be a bargain! I also had the veggie taco which was good but not as good as the shrimp.  We had nacho chips and guac as well. Guac was excellent, chips ok. We didn't have drinks except water but I noted they had some nice mocktails and even fresh carrot juice.  Service was really friendly and we were offered the choice of tables even though we were two people. We took advantage and sat at a sprawling picnic style tabl with lots of room and a great view out the large windows onto Dundas/Junction."}
{"text":"Went here with my 2 friends, we ended up ordering 10 tacos between all us. Only ended up getting 5/10 and ended up sitting there waiting for the rest. Not knowing that the server had not punched in the proper order. We sat there for 40 min for 5 tacos. And it wasn't even busy.  Very un organized"}
{"text":"I had a large ($10) alambre burrito which comes with pork, poblano peppers, green peppers and onions - they were out of guacamole which was unfortunate as I'm sure that would have added to the taste and texture immensely. They added a few more small plastic dabs of salsa to make up for it, but it didn't seem to. It was tasty (the pork was cooked nicely as were the peppers and onions) and I didn't feel like a giant slug after like I usually do when scarfing a large burrito of a similar price point. The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and they have glass bottled sodas which is always a nice treat. Still, it was a bit pricey and I'm not dying to go back immediately. I would to sample the tacos though, and as long as there's guac still available."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star rating due to the authenticity with their delicious Mexican cuisine and the excellent service. I definitely recommend the Al Pastor tacos! The pork is juicy, tender and the pineapple adds the perfect touch. They also have a wide array of hot sauces that give that extra kick if you're a fan of spicy food! I will definitely be back again for one of the city's best taco spots!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, terrible.  Wanted to try this new local business and throw it some love, so I ordered for takeout.  I received the wrong meat in my tacos, not what I ordered.  Not a huge deal, I figured it'd be a good lunch anyway but dear god.  These tacos are SO DRY. Good lord.  No amount of taco sauce could fix this.  So much chewing.  It was so dry, I went out and bought a tub of sour cream to try to add a bit of moisture.  Even loading on the sauce and sour cream, the tacos were dry as hell.  Tastes/looks like this meat is pre-cooked and sliced and then left out all day, then microwaved when you order.  So gross and pretty much inedible.  Do yourself a favour and go to one of the other local Mexican restaurants, which have WAY better quality for a comparable price."}
{"text":"Geez. Recently I decided to check out Al Pastor- the Junction's latest eatery.  The place looks quite tempting from the street. With its cool tile floors and rather simple high stools, you get a sense that this place is both fun and inexpensive. Two things that work well on a hot summer Saturday.  For starters, Al Pastor has no air conditioning and a working kitchen in a small space. On a warm day it is easily 5-10 degrees hotter inside than out.  I ordered tacos al pastor, a 10$ order of 4 tacos with pork, pineapple and onions. This had all the makings of cheap deliciousness- only it wasn't. The wait was a bit long. Not terrible, yet in that heat it was not fun. The tacos themselves each had two small soft tortillas. They were very small tacos with almost nothing in each of them. To make matters worse, the pork that was there was bland and dry.  I do not typically have a huge appetite. I was still hungry after eating the tacos al pastor.  Perhaps this place will improve. In the meantime, there are much better places for Mexican."}
{"text":"My first time here. Great service, lots of room with large tables. Not too noisy. The tacos were great! Very reasonably priced at 4 for $12. I had steak, braised beef, veggie (mushroom, poblano peppers, onions), chicken. My favourite new spot in The Junction!"}
{"text":"Ordered the guac and chips - onions are suppose to compliment the guac and not over power the taste of the avocado.   Tried the ceviche - avocados were not ripe.   We came on a weekend so they had a temporary liquor license. White sangria was tasty.   Fish tacos - avocados were again, not ripe enough. You can barely eat them. The fish itself was rather tasty tho!   Decor is nice.   Wish they would work on tasting their food before they take it out to the customers."}
{"text":"Yuck. Ordered the Al Pastore, it was chewy! how can it be Chewey? Ordered the brisket, it tasted like it was doused in barbeque sauce! Ordered the Tinga, it looked so gross we didn't even take a bite. I think the tacos were doused in butter possibly, they were soggy and falling apart. Basically we took a few bites of everything and found it to be disgusting and threw it out.  I don't know what the problem was with the food. We spent $24 on food that should've cost less than $12, and I can't understand the great reviews it got in now magazine, but I'm assuming somebody paid off the reviewer. La cantina down the street is better even if it's a little pricey. Finding authentic Mexican food at a decent price in the city has been an ongoing issue for a few years now. But this was crap."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat at in The Junction. Trust me, I live in the area and this is the only place I've ever gone to eat at more than once.    Great Mexican food at fair prices."}
{"text":"Awful, literally eat anywhere else.  Pork (al pastor) was beyond dry, like chewing on dried out shoe leather.  Fish, they fried pieces of frozen fish, tasted terrible, $7 per is the biggest rip-off in Toronto  Shrimp, completely inedible.  Only tolerable thing was the guac, which was decent (or maybe when next to all of the other crap it shone brighter than it would have otherwise).  I would have rather chewed on a used sock...."}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious and authentic. Perhaps the most authentic I've had in Canada (and this is saying a lot considering I've spent several years living in California). My favorite is the chicken taco followed by the steak and the mushroom.   I also really love their aqua frescas. The pineapple coconut water or the hibiscus drink are delicious. I'm not a big horchata fan but their version with almond milk is pretty tasty.   The only reason this place is not getting five stars are the burritos. Burritos are not a traditional Mexican food, so there isn't really an \"authentic\" version of it other than the American Tex Mex, Cali-Mex version of it. So that being said, not adding beans or rice to the burritos makes them soggy and drippy. We tried the mushroom burrito and while the filling is the same as the taco mushroom filling, it just doesn't work as a burrito filling on it's own.   I really enjoyed the food here and would make a special trip just to have the tacos."}
{"text":"I loved Al Pastor. Loved the atmosphere, loved the tacos and i've never had a better mezcal margarita. The tacos are authentic and flavorful. I want them right now!!"}
{"text":"Walking into Al Pastor, you immediately feel the sense of a wandering traveler stumbling into a taqueria of a local town in Mexico. No detail is overlooked in the vibrant colours and quaint and picturesque decor. The staff is very welcoming and attentive without being overly intrusive to the table conversation.  Now for the most important part - the FOOD! The musts here are definitely the spicy ceviche (nice kick of flavor), fish tacos (which are lightly crisped and not overwhelming), and the Al Pastor tacos (tender pork that melts in your mouth). If, like me, you're a dessert fan, DEFINITELY try the frutas con crema which is a healthy and delicious taste to end off on. It's fresh mixed berries lightly layered and topped with homemade cream and garnished with orange zest. A burst of flavor in every bite and perfect for a hot summer day!   Overall, I will definitely come back and plan to stop by every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Tried the burrito, very bland. Burrito only has meat, onion, cheese and green peppers. It didn't have much taste, no rice or beans inside which i believe makes the burrito seem as if it's lacking.   The atmosphere was great. I bit hot but they have a portable a/c which is fine. I loved the tables and the design of the place.  The cashier was nice and so was the girl that brought us our food. Only down side is the food, compared to La Cantina there's a big difference."}
{"text":"Great food!  It's easy to tell that the food is made with care and I appreciate the effort to make my experience a great one."}
{"text":"Really great taco spot. Love the texture and density on their tacos here. The pork (with pineapple) taco is especially good too. Nice value for money. Easy to make it a consistent favourite."}
{"text":"It started out great but it's now one of many Mexican taco joints that try to be authentic. The set up is kind of wired... not very inviting, tortillas were not double on each taco which is typical in Mexico, and they give you a tiny bit of salsa. We saw at least 4 costumers that entered the place and immediately left."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm not a fan.  Their prices are a bit too high and you can get better tasting tacos very close by.  Their Horchata had no flavor.  Very sad that this wasn't a win for us."}
{"text":"Had some of the best mezcal margaritas here. The tacos were on point, delivering on authentic taste and feel. Can't wait to go back!"}
