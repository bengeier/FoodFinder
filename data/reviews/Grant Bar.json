{"text":"I ate here on Saturday with my family and was very impressed. It is an old fashioned setting but the prices are reasonable, the service was excellent and the food was very good as well. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I had in ages. We waited over an hour to get our food while other diners came and went. We finally took it to go. The waitress said it was because we ordered an appetizer. No apology and a total lie.  When I got home I sadly discovered the fresh crab cake was actually fake crab! $16 for fake crab? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not bad,  not great. Nice atmosphere with kind and professional staff. Food? Typical bar food, nothing spectacular at all. Great place for older folks."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Grant Bar last night.  We have been there before and always enjoyed it.   After reading reviews here it seems everyone likes the shrimp and few like their \"signature\" marinated steak.  Living dangerously I ordered their surf & turf to try both.   Portions were small with 3 shrimp and a small steak.  The shrimp were excellent and the steak was medium as ordered and also very good.  It was neither over tenderized nor tough.  I did have to use my knife to cut it but it had a juicy pink center and was not chewy.  My wife had the cod almondine and she thought it was different than the last time she had it but she enjoyed it.  The mushroom soup was excellent containing lots of fresh mushrooms. They had no happy hour specials so we first stopped at the Grist House 3 blocks away.  I highly recommend that or Draai Laag for beer but both have limited hours."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about three times now, and it's always been good.  The staff are pretty friendly, even telling us the history of the bar and it's past as a hotel.  They make a mean burger and their Saturday Prime Rib is pretty darn good given the price.  The marinated steak however is more like dried out chuck roast.  I won't be getting that again. Overall though, it's a place I will enjoy going to again.  It's earned it's atmosphere, and after 87 years, it's earned it's spot as a landmark. P.S.  One more thing, we found out that if you want the Prime Rib on Saturdays, you'd better get there early, or call ahead and reserve your cut."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a Friday night bowl of turtle soup!  The staff are all welcoming and also efficient. The pies are great for desert."}
{"text":"I have only been here for the pub and have not tried the food.  But the atmosphere is great.  The bar staff is always nice and attentive.  There are okay options for beer.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured on a Rick Sebek PBS show about pie. The gentleman who makes the pies has been there for 60 years! Had to make the drive.  I made a reservation and was glad that I did. The place was packed by 6. I ordered the combo - 4oz marinated steak and stuffed shrimp. I seriously didn't need my knife to cut the steak; tender and flavorful. The stuffed shrimp was tasty.  My dining partner had the rainbow trout which I also tasted - probably the best I've ever had.   I took a piece of the banana cream and the coconut cream home - goodness they were both wonderful - nice homemade crust and the topping was not overly sweet. YUMMO   Please try this gem - I love off the beaten path - mom and pop - homemade food - getting away from the chain restaurants- don't think you'll be disappointed.  Nancy was our waitress. She and the staff will take good care of you."}
{"text":"The best place to have a delicious meal every time!!  I've been going to the Grant Bar for over 40 years, the menu hasn't changed much and doesn't need to change because the food is consistently delicious.  The wait staff has been there for years too~~ BJ & Nancy are the best along with the other women they treat you like family.  My favorite is the Surf & Turf~~Marinated Beef Steak and Jumbo Butterflied Fried Shrimp with a baked potato and salad with ranch dressing.  Love the Banana Cream Pie too!!"}
{"text":"Tried the fried shrimp (very good), fresh green beans, onion rings are great.  Just a bit pricey for the food/atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my Mother for a quick lunch, I had the cheeseburger. The burger was absolutely phenomenal. On par with a Tessaro burger."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food is always extremely well made, the staff is prompt, polite, and helpful. The fact that the bar is separate from the restaurant is nice too. It gets pretty busy, which obviously means it's popular and for good reason. I've recommended the grant to many people."}
{"text":"Bartenders are great. Drinks are averagely priced. Food is American home style comfort food in my opinion, but good, with lots of choices. Not a ton of super healthy choices... but there are a few. I love the grilled portobello sandwich, add Swiss cheese and make it amazing. Their beets are yummy, as well as the cottage cheese! My friends are big fans of the chicken parm and the clam chowder. The ham when on special is also yum!THE APPLE-PIE IS AMAzing. It's almost like apple crisp. Thinly sliced apples and taste my crust/toppings. Not overly sweet. I love it."}
{"text":"Intrigued by the range of ratings, I decided to try it when going through Millvale recently. If you are looking for a young, hip crowd, eating fusion cuisine....this ain't it.  If you want solid food in a working class neighborhood....this is it.  I even had the little old blue-haired ladies around me to prove it.  The walls are decorated with fake logs and guessing from some of the menu items, it might have been a German restaurant sometime in it's long past. The waitstaff was excellent. If you are looking for a server who is doing this while trying to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life....this ain't it.  If you want someone who knows the menu, and is quick and efficient....this is it. My philosophy when trying a place for the first time, is to try what they are known for.  In this case it is the fried shrimp and pie. Done deal.  So I was a bit under-whelmed by the shrimp.  The batter was underdone and pretty bland.  The cocktail sauce helped a lot, but some tartar sauce would have been better.  My advice is to try the 3-piece version first.  It won't fill you up, but you won't regret it later, because you will have room for the pie.  It comes with 2 sides, so I asked for a Caesar salad  They have Caesar salad on the menu, so they should know how to make it. The waitress said they could put some romaine on a plate and add some croutons.  Thinking maybe they didn't want to do a whole Caesar, I asked for the Caesar salad as both my sides. But I got exactly what the waitress said. A big plate of thinly shredded romaine, a few croutons and a cup with some obviously bottled dressing.  If someone else wants to figure out if they can make a decent Caesar salad, go ahead, it ain't gonna be me! The good news is the pie was excellent.  A large piece of thick and creamy coconut cream with a nice flaky crust.  If you decide to risk the 5 piece shrimp, you can always make the pie to go. Would I go back? Nope.  Would I go back if someone else was buying me lunch? Yup.  Would I go back for pie and coffee? Yup."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Great food and service. Known for shrimp and other seafood. Chicken, Burgers, soups and salads. Desserts.  Eat at bar or dining room."}
{"text":"I can echo a lot of other reviews when I say that this is not your edgy, trendy, hipster restaurant. You won't find any cutting edge items on the menu, but you will always find reliably good food. It's a charming place that's been around for years and years, known for their turtle soup and HUGE slices of pie. I've been there more times than I can remember but for some reason I've never tried the turtle soup, so I can't attest to its greatness. I have tried a number of things from burgers to shrimp to fish, and everything has left me feeling satisfied. And the pies. They live up to the hype, but be prepared to be in a sugar coma for the next few days. One thing to note is that they do not have much in the way of healthy or vegetarian options. This is probably obvious to most but I wanted to highlight it just in case. You will be able to find something on the menu, but the Grant isn't known for its salads.  What I think really sets the Grant apart is its wonderful staff. The service has always been excellent - the staff is welcoming, friendly, and kind. The servers know the menu inside and out and are happy to help with any questions or offer recommendations.  Come in here on a Friday night (especially during lent) and you may find yourself having to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. The Grant is packed with regulars, which I myself may officially be now? Anyway, if you do stop in, be sure to appreciate the Grant for what it is - a charming family-owned operation that's stood the test of time."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Grant Bar.  It's wonderfully old school and authentic, visiting there is like stepping back 50 years in time.  I highly recommend their pork chops. Their Coconut Cream Pie is a specialty that will be featured in the upcoming national Pie show by the very talented Rick Sebak of WQED.  It is light as a feather, flavorful, and everything a great Coconut Cream Pie should be.    This place is authentic Pittsburgh, nothing fancy, but reasonably priced and a real slice of restaurant history.  The bar part is in the front, but the dining rooms are in the back and the atmosphere is like hunting lodge."}
{"text":"Pretty standard old time Pittsburgh place. The food is about what you'd expect, but a little expensive for what you get. I liked their fries and homemade ranch dressing. I did not like the fact that they use miracle whip on their club sandwich; miracle whip probably should never be used instead of mayonnaise at a restaurant, it kind of crosses a boundary if you ask me. Also the decor is weird... they use fake bricks and trees for the walls. I will say that they make one hell of a pie."}
{"text":"Love it here. Home made food.  Not real fast service  but worth it. Home made pies.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love the Grant Bar! I've been coming to this place with my family since I can remember eating out at restaurants. This is definitely not your fancy Friday Night dinner, but it's a great place to grab a quick meal before hitting the breweries up in Millvale. The staff couldn't be friendlier.   I have yet to taste a better burger in Pittsburgh.It's grilled to perfection. Make sure you leave room for the delicious pie!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but nothing to rave about.  The food is overpriced - $11 for a turkey club sandwich!?!  Service was the worst. I really started to think our waitress left for the evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night after reading the article in the Pittsburgh quarterly magazine. At 6pm we had about a 30 minute wait. We had a couple drinks and waited at the bar. (We were the only people actually drinking at the bar. Everyone else was eating). We shared a fish sandwich (which was plenty big to share) and had room for pie. The sandwich was good but the pie is were it's at! Reminded me of my grandma's cream pies. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Place was slow, maybe 5 other customers.  Ordered a beer at the bar, never got it, bartender didn't care, in fact, couldn't have given any amount  of fucks for the customers. Left and drank elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife for dinner.  We had both driven past the Grant Bar many times before and it was only after getting it recommended by a friend and hearing how amazing the Coconut Creme Pie was that ultimately got us there.  The outside of the building leaves a little to be desired as it is clearly pretty old.  Thankfully once you are inside it looks pretty nice.  There are three separate rooms inside with one being a large bar area, a second being an area that sells merchandise and the third area where we sat being a dining room.  The dining room was seat yourself and we found an open table and plopped down.  One thing to note about the dining room is that it is very open and so can be extremely loud.  I only mention that because our waitress had to tell me the soup du jour three times because I couldn't hear her.  For dinner on this evening I decided to go with the Parmesan cod and chose sides of pea soup and a salad with a balsamic dressing.  My soup came out first and since I was hungry I quickly dove into it.  It had a thickish consistency with large pieces of ham in it.  I thought that it tasted alright, especially whenever I got some ham in a bite, but it certainly wasn't anything special.  The salad was the same way as it was your run of the mill restaurant salad with a few toppings of onion, tomato and croutons over a bed of mostly iceberg lettuce.  Thankfully my Parmesan cod ending up having a lot more flavor than the soup and salad.  Even though its name for some reason reminded me of chicken Parmesan which would have just been weird, I still ordered it.  It came covered in \"old world bread crumbs\" with some Parmesan on top of a butter sauce.  The fish itself was somewhat flavorless and so I enjoyed the butter sauce and Parmesan which gave it a nice flavor while the bread crumbs added some much needed texture to the dish.  After my wife and I had both finished our dinners we each ordered our slice of coconut creme pie ($3 a slice on special!). Now this is where the Grant Bar really shines for me as the pie was absolutely delicious.  The crust was nice and buttery while the pie itself was decadent having a great creme with the perfect amount of coconut taste.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While some of the food left something to be desired I did end up enjoying my fish and the coconut creme pie alone might be worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Came by here with my wife on a Thursday night.  An oddly interesting restaurant, having a German style and menu that my grandparents would thoroughly enjoy. During our visit I think we were the youngest people there by 20 years.   Food: 3.5 stars.  The food was definitely above average. My wife ordered the ham with broccoli and chicken noodle soup. The soup was ok, broccoli was steamed and had a nice buttery flavor, and the ham was very tastey having been cooked with brown sugar. I had the cod with vegetable soup and home fries. The home fries and soup were alright and the cod with its butter and breading hit the spot.   The reason this is a 4 star is the nice staff and the cool atmosphere. A very quaint restaurant in millvale that your parents are sure to appreciate. This isn't a place I would frequent often, but definitely try it at least once for the experience. I enjoyed my dinner here!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! It's been in Millvale nearly 85 years. Best baked potatoes I've ever had, and their prime rib special on Saturdays is amazing. Especially the special for two. I've never eaten anything less than super yummy here, and I love it!"}
{"text":"After a bike ride last night our usual stop had a 45 minute wait so we went to Grant Bar instead.  Great choice...old timey woodland decor, a leisurely pace and super friendly staff.  Among the 6 of us we had shrimp, rainbow trout and chicken ranchero sliders which I will try replicating at home.  So much variety on the menu and dishes you won't see many places.  Everything was delicious!  Do not forget to leave room for pie...not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Has some old school menu items you'd see in the 70's or 80's, but everything I've had has been good.  Good service, awesome turtle soup!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great old fashioned bar!!!!  Awesome place!!!!  Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"Our path to pie was paved with really delicious food and drink! While trying to decide to eat one day, we finally caved to try somewhere new that has been on our list for-ev-er. We went on a Friday at lunch, and instantly there was this vibe inside you were going back in time where everyone knows everyone! You can tell a lot of thought went into the architecture ad items on the walls inside, as well as a deep care about the food.   It's very american, homey, nicely cooked food. I thought the price we paid was very fair for the quality and quantity of food. I had the chicken parmigiana with a house salad (chose honey mustard dressing), rolls, and fries. My husband had the breaded chicken sandwich with onion rings. Both pieces of chicken were perfectly cooked without being greasy and the breading did a nice job of staying on the chicken. The fries and onion rings were perfectly cooked, and the onion rings with their simple breading were really good. (No onions sliding out of the breading!) With our meal we enjoyed a Troeg's Sunshine Pils from the bar.  When you visit Grant Bar, you HAVE to have the pie, you just HAVE to. (There's always room for dessert!!!!) Our server listed off the pies for the day and we chose the coconut cream pie and the egg custard pie. The egg custard pie was a very unique, and delicious pie. It tasted almost like egg nog, but with the texture of a fabulous key lime pie. If the pie is available when you go, this reviewer insists you try! The coconut cream was very delicious as well, but I'd say the egg custard was the winner in this round! Want to know something cool? I noticed, and then researched that yes the crust is pricked, and then brushed with egg white to keep the crusts from getting soggy! More extra deliciousness that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"Recently, I finally got around to trying the hallowed fried shrimp. Neither underbattered or overbattered to donut consistencies, the quintet of butterflied shrimp was cooked to an ideal stage. Also coated in batter were the above par french fries. However, aside from the chipper service, the rest of my pre-concert (Enslaved, Ancient VVisdom, Royal Thunder, and Pallbearer at Mr. Smalls!) dinner at Grant Bar was a downhill ride on a bad road.   My side of cole slaw, and the apple pie (with rock-hard ice cream yet) I had for dessert were both almost completely flavorless. The cup of Turtle Soup, something I had been dying to sample for most of my life, tasted like a Campbell's can of tomato-based fraud with microscopic cubes of mystery meat playing the role of the tortoise. For years my father has told me that area bars catch turtles and make soup from them. What I had last night came off as storebought and warmed over. Urban myth? Considering the harmless neoteny of these shelled critters, I am ambivalent.   Regardless, consider my experience to be a half-horsed one.   P.S. That shrimp was very good, though, easily beating out the faux (?) crabcakes I had during my last visit."}
{"text":"We took out 2 pieces of the pie to feed four adults.  It got 4 thumbs-up.  Delicious and creamy with toasted coconut  on top, it was the best cocanut custard pie I have ever had."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Turtle soup!  Used to go here with my Dad, we always had a good meal.  I'd get a double burger that was stacked so high with fixings, they held it together with toothpicks.  My Dad would get braunschweiger with onion along with a beer to wash it down with.  Some of my favorite memories are going there with him, and they will remain with me."}
{"text":"Millvale is on the fast track to becoming the next Lawrenceville and with that said one place that should remain the same is the Grant Bar. Not only is it a piece of history but there's much more. I like going in and being treated like an old friend. Have only been a handful of times but the staff test you like they've known you a lifetime. The food, oh my, the food. We've had all of these burger place popping up the last few years and one of the best places to get one is right under our noses; without the price gouging. Burgers are so fresh and juicy and I'm dying to know what goes into them.  And the desserts...oh jeez the pies! My boyfriend and I are big fans of splitting meals. Let me tell you that a slice of pie is more than enough for two people. Seriously a small family could split a piece. Whenever I have people visit I like taking them to Pittsburgh area establishments that are off the beaten path of tourism. Grant Bar is in the top ten for that! Ok now after writing this review I'm starving."}
{"text":"When Rick Sebak says it's a good place to go, you go! So I went, and while the food may not have blown me away, the pies are totally worth the drive here!  You can totally tell this is a spot that sees repeat costumers day in and out. We had an early dinner at 5pm and it was packed with families and couples. The decor reminds you of a ski chalet, it's quite cozy. All you needed is a roaring fireplace!  We read the reviews about the battered shrimp, so we started off with that as an app. They were very good, and I believe that breadcrumb family recipe is legit. Plus, the cocktail sauce was surprisingly good. But the main dishes we split, between the rainbow trout, almondine cod and seafood platter were a little bland.   The real treat is the pies, as I stated earlier. Most are cream pies, offering their famous coconut cream pie, but also banana cream, chocolate cream and an apple pie, among other choices... I kinda zoned out after my excitement set in for the coconut pie.   It was light and fluffy and delicious, just like you'd expect it to be. Toasted coconut flakes just topped it off. I hear the owner bakes a bunch of pies in the morning and you get what you get by the end of the day, so I was glad to enjoy the coconut one!   While I probably wouldn't be back for dinner, I'd definitely be back for a slice of pie... or the whole pie!"}
{"text":"If anything, come here just for the pie. But if you want to make a whole meal of it do it! This is a staple in Millvale and it attracts locals who have been coming for 30+ years. I was pleasantly surprised that this place was as good as it was. Everything is made in house including their onion rings and pies. As a vegetarian they have several options, but the place is especially known for their fried shrimp. At our table, the club sandwich was a hit as well. Definitely make room for the pie!"}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will ever set foot in this place.  If you don't read this entire review I would like you to take away these adjectives used to describe this failure of a restaurant; disgusting, dated, bland, nauseating, repulsive, and low quality.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. My girlfriend drove into town late and we wanted a place nearby to eat so we went to Grant Bar and Lounge.  We walked in and were seated quickly.  Our waitress was fairly busy and working a handful of tables but was quick to give us menus and take our drink order.  I should have known by the quality and cleanliness of the menu that we should leave immediately.  My menu was stained with unknown foods or fluids and crumpled like someone used it to practice their origami homework. We shared the Fried Jumbo Shrimp ($13) plate as an appetizer although it is not listed as an appetizer.  She ordered a glass of lambrusco red and I ordered a Yuengling.  The drinks arrived fairly quickly and the shrimp were a few minutes after that.  5 battered and deep-fried shrimp on a plate with cocktail sauce.  They were tail on, 12 count, de-veined and butterflied, then dipped into I believe house made batter and deep-fried. We then placed our main course orders.  She got the Broiled Seafood Platter ($23) - Comes with 8-10 36 count tail on shrimp, 2-3oz salmon, 4 scallops and a crab cake.  Turtle soup and baked potato were the sides for her.  I ordered the Marinated Top Sirloin Angus Steak ($20) - Supposedly this is a ~10oz marinated piece of angus top sirloin...sides were turtle soup and fries.  We also pre-ordered two pieces of apple pie to go for friends. The turtle soup arrives shortly thereafter with a breadbasket and crackers.  The dinner rolls were the cheap kind that you can buy in a tray (think Sam's club) and bake a sheet of like 48 of them at once, then pull them apart.  These are the type of white bread flavorless rolls that you would get at a fire hall chicken dinner or an all you can eat gun bash.  I had a roll, regretting it shortly thereafter.  I then tried the Turtle Soup.  It tasted like Campbell's Vegetable Beef soup and I question whether there was actually any turtle meat in it. I ordered my steak medium rare.  The steak was rare on one end and medium at the other.  However, that is not my main complaint.  This piece of beef, or whatever it was, must have been pounded for ten minutes to tenderize it.  The muscle fibers were smashed and flattened like a Swiss steak from a high school cafeteria.  The meat was somehow folded over itself with sinew and tendons holding pieces together.  I literally think that after hitting this thing for 10 minutes with a tenderizer, the cook took it outside and backed his car onto the meat and did a burnout on it and shot it onto the grill.  Hands down, this was the WORST steak (if that's what you call it) that I have ever eaten.  I did not finish it because it was DISGUSTING. About the time I found out that my meal was going to be horrible, I look over at my girlfriend and see utter disgust and thought she might throw up.  She tried the \"crab cake\".  I put that in quotes because whatever this oil soaked, filler laden patty of failure was, it was not a true crab cake.  She picked it apart and we find IMITATION CRAB all through it.  I could not find an actual piece of lump crabmeat anywhere in that heap of nastiness.  I was so embarrassed that I brought her to this butt crack of a restaurant.  I tried it just to see if she was correct and let me tell you that this was honestly the worst thing I have tasted...since my steak 30 seconds prior.  But now I was embarrassed for this restaurant and the people in charge of it.  The management and owners should be embarrassed and ashamed that they serve swill like this to humans...and charge them for it. She did not eat any more of that FAILURE CAKE or the salmon because it was swimming in a pool of butter.  She ate the shrimp, scallops, and her baked potato.  I ate my fries and we were out of that horrendous dining experience.  When the waitress came back she asked 'Was everything OK?\" because she noticed that neither of us finished our food.  I responded with something to the effect of 'Not really...is that crab cake...made out of...imitation crab?\"  The waitress responded with 'It's a blend\". The bill was $83.  Food this deplorable should be around $30.  I will never go back to this restaurant and will adamantly tell anyone that asks about it to run and hide.  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT/OWNER: You need to immediately investigate what is happening with the food served to your customers.  If you cannot figure out how to make a crab cake without FAKE CRAB, filler, doused in OIL then you should remove it from the menu.  Also, I have eaten angus meat for years and your claim of top sirloin angus is laughable.  You may be able to pass this filth off as steak in Millvale however I'm not buying it."}
