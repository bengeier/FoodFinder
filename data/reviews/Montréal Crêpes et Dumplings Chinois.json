{"text":"I tried the beer batter fried chicken crepe, and was impressed.  I came here from Toronto and this place was highly recommended.   The crepe was fabulous and definitely worth returning!!!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up but food has never made me this happy in my life!!!! Its super affordable and everything is made on the spot!  And the service was really good:D"}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese snack bar serving delicious Chinese crÃªpes and dumplings at the most unexpected place on Westminster. The crepes are thin and delicate, stuffed with your choice of meat or veggies and folded to eat like a sandwich. The beef jerky one was tasty and a bit spicy, while the pork one was delicious and less spicy. The dumplings are delicate and very good. The place is very clean but seating is limited to 2 counters against the wall. Perfect for a quick fix. I would definitively recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! My girlfriend and I go whenever we have a chance to my girlfriend is from China and she says it tastes exactly like the food she had in her hometown. Every dish on the menu is great I can choose blindly and will still be satisfied! Highly recommend to try its very affordable I mean that's why high school students rush the place every lunch hour but if you love asian food like I do then give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very small family run restaurant in the heart of Westminster. There are a lot of different options, I had the spinach & carrot dumplings with spring rolls. The food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and efficient.   Prices are reasonable and there are meat & veggie options. Will definitely be going back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I already left a 5 star review for the dumplings but had to write another review after trying their crepe. IT WAS SCRUMPTIOUS. In the future, I will have a hard time deciding between the two."}
{"text":"Yes, it is cheap, yest it is the only place in the whole neighborhood with Asian cuisine but no, it is NOT worth it.  The spicy is just salty with some crushed chilies in in. We had to add Sriracha sauce to make it taste good! In fact, we had to add sauce to make it taste like anything.  If you really want dumplings and not spend too much money, go to Chinatown and buy some frozen and eat them at home.  Or any other place with a high concentration of Asian people. I had such high hopes for Montreal Chinese Crepes & Dumplings based on their rave reviews but clearly, none of these have tried Qing Hua in their lives. Save yourself the long line of angry old ladies screaming at each other and hobbling over the steps for some 'sweet and spicy' dumplings. they are neither sweet,not spicy,not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food has been amazing everytime. Ignore the salthy review, food is bursting with flavours. Staff and owners really friendly. Not expensive, and always get your money worth"}
{"text":"Great food, incredible service and hospitality. If you don't know what you're looking for you might miss it and you'd be missing out. Great little spot!"}
