{"text":"Wow! I had no idea how much I needed Detroit style pizza in my life! Iron Born pizza was amazing! We ordered the Caesar salad and the heirloom pizza and both we're phenomenal! One pizza and a salad is enough food to split between 2 people. I highly recommend this place for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The crust is so hard to explain. It's crispy, light, and chewy at the same time. The almost-burnt cheese around the crust is a very nice touch. I have had the Heirloom and the White, and they both have a slightly lemony taste to them. The cheese is very decadent. I know they make at least the cheese on the Heirloom in-house. I really hope Iron Born opens its own location after its time at Smallman Galley is up. It will thrive!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Meat pie, add an egg and bam your brunch is set.  Come to the smallman galley it's an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the most unique pizza I have ever had. The crust is oily and will remind you of the excitement of Pizza Hut as a kid. The sauce rivals the best Italian restaurant I've been too. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Amazing Detroit style pizza. A little congested in the Galley but DEF worth the wait. We drove 100 miles to try this place out based on a recommendation. Totally craving it as I write this post. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is legit. The crust is super light and full of flavor. They add just the right amount of sauce and toppings. Even though it looks like one thick pie, it's deceiving. I easily ate my whole pizza and didn't feel like I had a pizza baby and was going to die. The ingredients are super fresh. A must try for any Pittsburgh Pizzaboy or girl."}
{"text":"I really dig this pizza and I'm glad someone other than Jets is introducing Detroit-style pizza to Pittsburgh! So the pizza is baked in a rectangular pan so the crust is on the thicker side and it has these incredible crispy edges. Iron Born's sauce is garlicky and delicious, and the toppings are so fresh. It's kind of hard to describe how incredible the pizza is, so you just gotta go try it for yourself. 

You'll be looking to spend about $20 for a pie that will probably only feed one person. The price might be a bit steep but the overall experience of this pizza is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I have never really had pizza like this before, it is almost like Sicilian, but much more oil/fried bottom to it. There is a nice contrast between the charred edges/cheese and the supper fluffy/soft inside dough. We got the red pizza no pepperoni for me, which I think was my mistake. The plain pizza was a little--plain. It really needs something to get it to what I would call 5 stars, but my husband really liked the half with pepperoni. If I went back, I would get something with other toppings. 

The extra slices microwaved really well. I was surprised."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza in a cool location. In Smallman Galley which is food court style type dining but much more quaint. We went on Mother's Day at lunchtime and got our order placed and food was brought out quickly. Staff was friendly and helpful. We tried the Red Pie and Buffalo pie both were really good. Thick style crust and 8 Square slices in each pizza. I consider myself a picky Pizza person and this pizza was delicious. Sauce not spicy or sweet, perfect amount of cheese, and crust was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back to try something else next time! Would recommend for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  All the ingredients taste fresh and good.  Would be nice to be able to call and order.  I wanted my pie to go and had to wait a while for it after ordering.  Probably even better eating fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"Went to Smallman Galley yesterday for this pizza because we have been reading so many good reviews online about it. It did not disappoint. We got a salad, a white pie, and the fungi pie. The fungi pie was AMAZING. Would definitely get that again. The white pie was good with the pieces that had carmelized onion on it but not all the slices did. Crust was thick and different.  Loved it!!! Would give it 5 stars if they were cheaper in price."}
{"text":"There is so much hype about this place that I had to check it out for myself, and I'm so glad I did! I couldn't decide between the red or white pie, so naturally, I chose the two sauce pie. I still can't decide which sauce I liked better because they were both incredible! And the fennel sausage on top-omg, to die for. This pizza is super crispy on the outside, but soft and almost doughy on the inside. It really did live up to the hype, and I'll be back again to try more pizzas! Mind-blowingly good pizza!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find this location, it's in a very unique shared space with other restaurants with shared eating area and shared bar area. Absolutely worth the effort though! Very unique selection, great scenery, and delicious food! We had mimosa's and the brunch pizza. Very good! Mimosas were $7 each, pizza was $19. Check them out if you want some amazing food!"}
{"text":"I wish I had visited this place sooner. This is the pizza of my dreams.  I had the white pizza and ate until I was stuffed because it was so delicious. The crust was so thick and fluffy and wonderful and I just wish I could eat this pizza every day and not gain 200 pounds. 

However, the bussers hovered and made my boyfriend and me feel awkward for taking some time to sit and enjoy our food (it wasn't crowded and there was plenty of room). I know they were trying to be polite, but back off a bit please. The pizza was so good that this really didn't take away from the experience."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! Its worth getting but you might want to share it with someone."}
{"text":"This place redefines pizza for the city of pittsburgh. Just savory fluffy crust topped w top of the line sauce and ingredients. Then it's baked within a iron pan w cheddar cheese that caramelizes the outside of the crust to give it yet another breath taking level of flavor.  I ate the Spicy pie and spicy it was!!! Just right amount of heat with a sweetness piercing through the middle."}
{"text":"Solid good pizza. And I didn't even have to pay the iron price.

One pizza is definitely enough for two people. I had the red top pizza. Too much crusty cheese on the outside, and they could definitely up the rosemary which you basically can't taste. Good red sauce."}
{"text":"Still excellent. I've been back several times since my first review. I continue to LOVE this pizza. 

I've not been able to progress past the Red Pie. It's that good, in my opinion. 

The Caesar salad is nice, too."}
{"text":"I was wanted to try this for a while. They did not disappoint. The pizza was very unique and extremely delicious. Never heard of Detroit pizza before until I looked it up. Definitely the best thick pizza in town and I would skip the lack luster Pittsburgh pizza scene and go here."}
{"text":"I LOVE Detroit-style pizza (ok, two weeks ago I didn't even know what it was).  I had the white pizza. Great flavor, perfect crust, with just enough toppings. Too many places try to add too many greens. This was perfect. 

I ordered through GrubHub, I don't recommend that. The pizza was cold and I only live a really short drive away. However, definitely still go for the pie!! Such good pizza."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried this place out this weekend. All I got to say boom!  Over the top pizza with flavor I will go here again and again"}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely delicious. The first time I visited, it was for a yelp event, and we tried the red pizza with pepperoni. Most recently, I came on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the red cheese pizza ($13). Yes, it's a little pricey, considering you only get 6 slices, however it is a very filling pizza, and is absolutely delicious. Thicker bread, lots of cheese, delicious red sauce, fresh basil and parm- omg...I'm drooling thinking about it. As others have mentioned, this is \"Detroit style pizza\" and I've never had the opportunity to try anything like it in Pittsburgh before. It's a must-try and I really hope Iron Born finds a permanent home after their time at Smallman Galley is up! Dreaming of the next time I will be visiting..."}
{"text":"Really, go here and get pizza. In 2016, I had the best pizza in my life in Rome. I did not think I would find one comparable with 200+ year old sourdough crust, but I did. This deep dish crust pizza is full of flavor, the cheese on the edges crisps up to add a little something extra. The Make a Wish pizza is fun and creative, but we had the mushroom and the garden pizza, which had fresh ingredients and packed full of flavor, texture and smells, that makes this pizza an all sense on board experience. 

Though don't forget the garden salad. The marinated garbanzo beans and fresh vegetables should not be skipped.

*Note not about the restaurant: When we were there (June2018) was construction on one side and made navigating a challenge, but it is worth it. There is a parking garage about two blocks up, reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I came to Smallman Gallery, which is similar to a food court but gives off a much more modern and hipster vibe. Even though it was post-lunchtime, around 2 PM, this place was still absolutely packed. It was really hard to find a seat after ordering food, so keep that in mind! 

I chose to eat at Iron Born Pizza since it was one of the first options I saw, and I definitely don't regret picking it. For $17, I got this massive, cheesy pizza topped with plenty of mushrooms that easily became two meals for me. I also swapped out the Gouda cheese for Mozzarella cheese since I'm not really a fan of Gouda. 

I'm definitely a fan of Iron Born Pizza - super solid pizza place with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I dream about this pizza every night.  This is the best pizza I've ever eaten.  I think that they lace it with heroin and crack cocaine."}
{"text":"Iron Born Pizza is a must try. Chef Pete has created a fan for life with fresh ingredients and consistency.  The deep Detroit style crust is unlike anything I've ever tasted. The crust is crispy on the edge to perfection and light and airy in the middle.  The pie choices will make everyone happy.  

My personal favorite is the White Pizza. With fresh greens, blistered tomatoes and fresh Ricotta it's my favorite go-to pizza.  

For being a deep dish pizza, the pizza isn't heavy in your stomach.  We each usually get our own pizzas but share and have enough for a late night snack. 

The Smallman Galley offers a full bar to compliment the drinks. My favorite place to sit at Smallman is along the row of restaurants."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. Seriously go eat it you won't regret it. 

The pizza is thick but not greasy. Great toppings. Awesome selection."}
{"text":"Iron Born Pizza is definitely good I've been twice.. First time gf got white pizza and I got cheese both tasty... The cheese is only like 13$... Another neat thing is you can eat the pizza at the bar or anywhere in the seating area.. The bar has good drinks as well"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down. The staff is friendly, the pizzas have awesome ingredients. Never a pie that I disnt like. PLEASE OPEN ON MONDAYS!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to some of the best pizza spots in Pittsburgh, and around the country, and Iron Born definitely sticks out as one of the best. The difference between a typical Chicago deep dish is that i leave feeling satisfied, and not wanting to crawl in a bed without moving for 2 days. Lou Malnati's in Chicago will always be my favorite deep dish, but Detroit may be on to something with the thick, crispy and oily crust. 

It's a MUST try at Smallman Galley. The Red Pie and Spicy Pie are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"As a Michigan transplant, I was excited and skeptical to try some Detroit Sicilian from Iron Born. The venue; Smallman Galley, is a great place to try new foods in a cafeteria/food court style setting. There are workers who come around and give you water and clean up the tables. As far as Detroit Sicilian, Iron Born hit the nail on the head and beyond. This pizza could go toe to toe with any of my favorite Detroit spots. The pizza is a 5/5 for sauce, cheese and airy crispy texture. This pizza is amazing. I tried the white pie and the meat pie. The flavors and presentation were all on point. The price was a little higher than I expected though as I paid almost 40.00 for two six cut pizzas. This is quite a bit more than you would normally pay in Metro Detroit at a place like Buddy's or Papa Romanos. I don't know if that is due to the fact that this could be considered gourmet pizza or the fact that they have to spend a lot of money to rent a spot and pay for things and staff at this venue. I will definitely come back the next time I am missing home and would recommend this to anyone looking to try something different. This is some of the best pizza you are going to find in the Burgh. I give this a 4.5-5.0."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is filled with a lot of pizza spots and a majority of those spots offer wood fired / thin crust pizzas. Iron born stands out because the crust reminds me of a Chicago style deep dish pizza and there are not many of those around. 

I ordered the Red pie ($15) which came with pepperoni and cheese. All of their pies are 6 square slices. I would highly recommend Iron Born if you are a thick crust fan! The only down fall would be the set up. Iron Born sits inside Smallman Galley with 3 other restaurants. The line situation gets confusing, it's in the strip so plan on parking far (unless you get lucky) and seating isn't monitored by a hostess or anything. It reminds me of a food court, when you see a spot you better snag it quick because this place gets busy! It's like real life hunger games, but I promise it will be worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Really nice Sicilian or Detroit style pizza- a must try in The Strip area. Hard to find so look for the \"Smallman Galley\" door to the food court across the street from the church and wander around to find it.

The pizza was delicious. Six slices per rectangular pie. The toppings are varied, fresh and delicious. The white pie came with fresh arugula, Ricotta and sweet caramelized onions make a nice combination/contrast. 

The meat pie (we added an egg on top) was flavorful and just a little bit of spice. The crust has a nice combination of crunchy putter crust and soft inside with a neutral taste to set up the wonderful toppings.

I would love to see the chef get a little more creative from his experience at Alinea but, that is a quibble. I would have given it a 4.5 just shy of a 5 rating as I expected a bit more creativity."}
{"text":"This pizza place is located in the smallman group of eateries 
You order at their counter get a number find a seat they will bring out your pie to you 
Cold water and napkins on every table which you bus yourself when done
I heard good things about their pizza it was time to give it a try
I don't eat meat 
They were happy to adjust a recipe
You can pick toppings
Either it was my fail on choices 
Greens shredded cheese that wasn't fully melted 
But the pizza was just ok 
The crust is thick not NY Sicilian thick more like Chicago pan pizza thick 
It was too chewy and oily not my style 
17.00 6 slices square pie can easily feed two people 
For grabbing a bite this pie is too much they don't sell slices
The concept of this eatery is good 
The price not so much 
I'm willing to give it another try with another square pie"}
{"text":"A must.  The pizza is thick and made in a pan but don't let the thickness fool you- its not super heavy. The dough is perfectly dense but light. This pizza will not leave you feeling like you have a dough baby.
The cheese and sauce are near perfection.  I've tried the one with the red sauce and the mushroom with black truffle oil. Each are amazing in their own right. 
This pizza is simple but out of this world."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Never heard of Detroit style pizza until seeing this place. It is absolutely amazing and worth the visit. The pizza shop is within a food hall of sorts and it's hidden inside. There are plenty of seats and it's quite a cool place in the strip district."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely delicious pie here!

We ordered the white pizza. It has: Garlic Cream - Caramelized Onions - Marinated Cherry Tomatoes - Arugula - Ricotta. This isn't something we would normally order, but I'm so glad we did. There was an overall light taste to this heavy ZA. The best part? THE CRUST. Thick, crunchy, chewy, oniony. Yum. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Although I've had pizza all my life, I've somehow made it this far without trying Detroit-style pizza... until now. As a huge fan of thin-crusted coal oven baked pizzas, I really wasn't sure how I'd feel about these rectangular thick crusts, especially since I've had badly made pizza with thick crusts before. However, this crust was light, pillowy, and moist, with a crunchy bottom (as if fried) and edges fused with cheese. The sauce is layered on top of a cheese layer which sits on the crust - also different from typical pizza. The combination was surprisingly good!

It was definitely tough to walk by without ordering a pie. It was entrancing to see staff bring out trays after trays of pillowy crusts and add various toppings before cutting them swiftly into 6 square slices using a rocking pizza blade. There are 8 options to choose from. We went with the Spicy Pie, which comes with hot sopressata, pepperoni, banana peppers, and spicy honey. It was a bit on the salty side, but had a quite flavorful kick to it. The quality was great given the price and portion. Each of these pizzas could probably feed 2-3 people - not bad for $16!

Not sure if this is a relatively new concept or I've just been living under a rock, but it is delicious and I'm glad I got to try it! It is currently located in Smallman Galley, in Pittsburgh's awesome Strip District - I definitely see a future trip back on the horizon."}
{"text":"Exceeded my high expections. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"3.5 review. 

I ordered the red top pie for ~$15, which would definitely feed 2. The pizza was really good. It wasn't the best Detroit style pizza I've had but it was solid. The cheddar-fried crust was a nice twist. I give the pizza a 4. A side salad option would be great to cut the heaviness of the pizza. Their website says that they do have a salad, so either they didn't have it when I went, or I missed it.

They told me that it would take approx. 30 minutes to get the pizza, which was pretty long to begin with, but I was happy to wait since I had been looking forward to trying the restaurant for a while. But, the pizza didn't come out for 50 minutes and there was no apology when the pizza did finally come. At a place like Smallman Galley, where people can order from different restaurants, the wait was especially annoying because my group, who had already finished their meals, had to wait for me."}
{"text":"STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING.  This is the BEST pizza in town. Go here now. If they arent open wait.  

Im typically an  NY pizza typa girl. But this place has changed my whole view on pizza. Ingredients are fresh, crust is perfect and the tiny pepperonis are the best kind!

Seriously do your tummy a favor and go check it out. They also deliver through yelp!"}
{"text":"I had never had a pizza with such a thick crust, but it was light and airy and crunchy and tasty, so to sum it up, I liked it.  The restaurant is located in a communal space with a few other places, but we found a table easily enough and the pizza was ready and delivered to our table in no time.   If I lived in the area I would definitely go back to try some of their other pizza offerings."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sicilian style pizza.  The pan crust was phenomenal with cheese that melted all around the outside crispy edges!  We had them meat pie and the sausage, pepperoni and ham blended perfectly with the chunky red sauce. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got a Philly cheesesteak pie which was $22 and my pie had less than 4 pieces of steak. 2 of the 6 slices had some steak in it. Deeply disappointed in what is currently Pittsburgh's best pizza trend."}
{"text":"Totally incredible. Not really much to say here.... everyone has beaten me to it. Get cuts, come hungry, plan on eating way too much and not feeling guilty about it in the least. Wear stretchy pants...."}
{"text":"Sicilian-Chicago-Unique greatness!  The pizza is a bit of all of those styles but it is truly different.  It is amazing and the crust is to die for.  Big servings!!The place is located inside Smallman Galley, a cool place onto itself.  Make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Iron Born Pizza is a game changer, and I am so happy that this restaurant concept has been made a reality through Smallman Galley. After taking my first couple bites of this pie, I hopped on my phone to research who the creator of such a concept was. His name is Pete Tolman, a Pittsburgh native who spent a short period of time at Alinea in Chicago, which is arguably the best restaurant in the United States (and where I've been dying to go for a couple years).

The inspiration comes from Detroit style pizza. Apparently, Detroit is known for extra-thick, super-crispy, deep dish pizza, and Iron Born delivers exactly that. Traditional Detroit pizza has the sauce on the very top while Tolman's pizza has the sauce towards the top but not necessarily the last ingredient. We tried both the Red Top and the White Pie. The Red Top is covered with pepperoni, a chunky tomato sauce, and parmigiana, while the White Pie is covered with garlic cream, onions, ricotta, and arugula. Traditionally, I like white pizzas, but as the garlic cream was a little too runny for my taste on the White Pie, I actually liked the Red Top better. However, you really cannot go wrong with either choice. Plus, let's not forget that each pie's edges are crispy with cheese. 

Based on my stalking of the restaurant's Instagram account, they also seem to offer a number of seasonal and even brunch options. I cannot wait to return to try some of these out."}
{"text":"Just had a incredibly burnt Philly cheesesteak pizza. I went up to show the staff how disgusting it was and they didn't seem that concerned and didn't offer me any compensation for my $18 purchase. That will be my first and last trip to this place."}
{"text":"How on earth could I possibly give this pizza anything short of 5 stars? The crust on this thing is super thick and there are lil burnt pieces of cheesy goodness on the sides from being cooked in a cast iron! The sauce is ample and delicious! The meats!!! Oh goodness...the meats!  The perfect amount of cheese ties it all together. I. Am. In. Love. That is all."}
{"text":"Yes this pizza is good. It was my first time trying Detroit-style pizza and I was not prepared for how thick and really, how different it was from normal pizza. Anyway, from what I remember you order than pick your own seat and you get water and napkins and sit at these cool wooden tables (ours had a hole in it and I had fun looking at my shoes through it). Eating is easy at this place.

We got two, the Red Pie and the other I don't remember but I think it had arugula on it. Both were good, though I preferred the mystery vegetable one, the taste being much different from anything I've tried. Crust has amazing crunch and flavour. Toppings and sauce taste-wise the mystery was a 5 and the red was a 3 (but very tomato-ey and I'm not the biggest tomato fan). I am interested in trying the other options.

They are very filling. VERY. And all you will want to do is sit and eat the whole thing. I know I did. I would say this is a must-try place for any pizza-lover."}
{"text":"Spicy Pie (pan-style pizza cooked in cast iron with a crisp crust but light interior) and some Dancing Gnome beers (Infinite Highway and Stained Glass Ceiling) 10/10 would eat and drink again. I shared this with my bf. Banana peppers on the side pls. This was $16 tho?????? Hot Sopressata, Pepperoni, House Banana Pepper, and Mike's Hot Honey. This was the perfect spice level. Service was p fast considering it was happy hour timeeeeee. Sit by the window for A+ lighting."}
{"text":"Iron Born is one of four restaurants located in the Smallman Galley. You walk up to any of the vendors, place your order, find a seat in the open seating area and they bring you your order. The concept of having 4 restaurants in one location is genius! We ordered something from every vendor and this pizza was by far my favorite. We had the white pizza with ricotta cheese, lemon, and arugula. The crust is deep dish and is crunchy without being dry. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"I dream about this Pizza! I must get back to the Burgh to have the red pie!!! Amazing Detroit Style Pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza had a pretty good taste. Its a little different from your normal pizza joint. I think I like it best when it fresh. I had leftovers and it was kind of dry after reheating it since they just put the sauce on top."}
{"text":"Although I have never been to Detroit, I have had Detroit pizza down in Austin, Texas (different owner and check it out if you are ever there, it's called via 313) the pizza is out of this world. The ingredients at iron born bistro are top notch on the quality scale. The dough is thick but light and airy. I highly recommend the white pie, the flavor is a party in your mouth!!! I hope they start accepting online or takeout orders soon."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 or 6 times and I am never disappointed. Chef Pete and crew come up with some unique and tasty combinations for pies. The staples always taste just as awesome as the last time. I'm so glad someone brought the Detroit Style of pizza to the area. Dreamy, crispy, cheesy crust, thick body, but somehow light and airy. Always quality ingredients. I hope when their time is up at the Galley, they are able to get a brick and mortar place and keep their awesomeness going."}
{"text":"Move over literally every pizza joint in Pittsburgh because there's a new king in town. The pizza Gods must have personally blessed Chef Pete Tolman because these pizzas are otherworldly.

There's no one in the burgh making pies quite like this. It's a Detroit style pizza, which boasts an extra thick crust that is somehow perfectly spongey and crispy in all the right places. It's baked in a cast iron square pan. But here's the kicker: cheese is spread over the edges of the dough and as that cheese bakes, it caramelizes and gives the crust an extra kick of flavor and texture. 

My favorite so far is the basic (but who am I kidding, it's anything but basic) red pie. This may be a weird thing to say, but you can really tell that every single ingredient is high quality. The sauce, the pepperoni, the cheese, everything tastes amazing and all together it's basically perfection. 

My next fave has to be the Fungi pie. I could live on mushrooms and cheese and bread so this is pretty much my dream pizza. 

The white pie is a fan favorite: Garlic Cream, Caramelized Onions, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula and Ricotta. The flavor combo here is striking. I'm not a huge fan of caramelized onions (I find them to be too sweet and over-powering) but I just scrape the onions off and voila! Deliciousness!

In case you can't tell, I'm a little obsessed with this place. I make my husband get take out from here on his way home from work at least every other week. I wish Chef Pete the best of luck and I hope to see him blessing the burgh with his pies for years to come."}
{"text":"My partner came to visit me, and we craved pizza. Being New Yorkers, we are skeptical when people tell us about a can't miss pizza, especially one so bread-heavy. But ohhhh they were right. We entered the zoo of Smallman Galley on a Saturday evening, placed the order, climbed over a herd of people and a mountain to grab a table in the bar area, and waited. Soon, our individual trays of pizza, thick and steaming, came to us. Each slice tears well, indicating a good yeast dough, and not too much sauce, so it's not wet. It's closest to focaccia with fresh, delicious toppings. We told ourselves we'd take home the leftovers. We demolished those pizzas and there were no leftovers. I was happily in pain for the sake of that pizza, and when I have the gastronomic fortitude, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The two sauce pizza is so good.  The red side is your traditional pizza, but the white side is an amazing creamy garlic white sauce.  The entire pizza is covered with melty delicious cheese and fennel sausage.  This is definitely a to share pizza!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, Batman! As far as pizza goes in this city, I have two favorites; Beto's and IRONBORN. This place knows how to make a delicious pie that you'll be thinking about for DAYS. I constantly go back for the spicy pie because holy crap is it good. It's a little pricey, HOWEVER, when you consider the price spent on a regular pizza and how much of that you will eat, this equals out to being relatively close. Get here soon and get this za in your belly."}
{"text":"This is not your run of the mill Pittsburgh pizza. This place offers a distinctive pizza style unlike any others in town. Detroit-style-esque with a super fluffy and softy middle and nice and crusty/crunchy/toasty crust. I can only speak to the red pizza as that's what I've gotten both times, but it's phenomenal! Big enough that you can easily split between two people--and since it's Smallman, you can get a side from any of the 3 other vendors if you chose! My husband and I like to get a red pizza from Iron Born and a Brunoise burger from Brunoise and split both! 
This place is definitely worth the trip of you're craving pizza that you can get at any other pizza joint in the city!"}
{"text":"I'm ridiculously fond of Detroit style pizza, so it's been great seeing it popularize and spread. When I heard about Iron Born being in the Smallman Galley, and saw the pictures, I had to get in. 

Based on photos, my expectations were high and I was not disappointed. 

The crust is a bit thicker than the classic \"Buddy's\" in Detroit, but it maintains that fluffy texture inside a caramelized layer of pan-kissed greatness. 

The red pie was classic and incredible. I added sausage as I measure all pies against each other with pepperoni and sausage, and it was perfect. My girlfriend had a spicy pie which is balanced really nicely with a honey drizzle. I heated up the remaining slices for a late night snack and it held up great. 

I've had some great pizza this year in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit, and this was up there near the top. I'll be heading back next time I'm near the strip. My first trip was damn near perfect."}
{"text":"Could not wait to try this pizza and it was definitely worth an evening trip to The Strip.

First, its a bit of a cafeteria setting - you'll find Iron Born amidst several other very enticing food vendors.  Hold your ground, it all looks good, but this pizza ala kiosk is amaZING!

I got the Spicy Pie and it has a teensy bit of honey, making it a sweet heat.  The crust is Detroit Thick and the personal size is perfect to sink your teeth into - You get six pieces and though starved, I could only enjoy four of them - with a perfect breakfast next morning.  Better than any cinnamon roll, for sure.  Remember:  Detroit Thick does not get yucky like regular or thick crust gets overnight.

Friend also fully enjoyed her selection.

It's really good, really casual, and you'll really love it."}
{"text":"Truly unique style of pizza for Pittsburgh! Iron Born Pizza may have a Yinzer name, but it's a Detroit style pizza. It is set on a fluffy, thick crust baked in a cast iron square pan which creates a truly delicious crispy caramelized crust and bottom. The cheese running over the edges creates crusty caramelized cheese!  This past Saturday for lunch I split the White Pie of : Garlic Cream - Caramelized Onions - Marinated Cherry Tomatoes - Arugula - Ricotta - and I added sausage. The combination was great! The garlic sauce isn't overpowering and the caramelized onions were delicious and sweet!  I would love to return to try another pie - the Carbonara Pie sounds delicious : )"}
{"text":"Going for brunch? Just get the Brunch Pie, just do it. Your dining partners will be in shock and awe when this arrives at the table. Sharing is a must or get a box to take some home for second breakfast. The brunch pie is cooked in a cast iron and topped with sausage, cheddar cheese, shaved fingerling potato, and a perfectly cooked over easy egg on top. This pie is almost...almost a bit too too sweet with the maple drizzle, but it does lend a nice flavor. Take a break after a few cuts. Together, all the flavors work very well together, but take it slow and enjoy the flavors.

I love how perfectly crisp the crust and cheddar cheese were around the outside edges. No burnt pies here!"}
{"text":"Best darn pizza I've had in years. Can't wait wait for the local restaurant(S)!

However it's not just the Pizza. The people working there are pretty personable and the unique style of pizza makes me feel like I'm eating actual \"restaurant quality\" food instead being at a \"glorified pizza shop\". It's like a more hip and diverse version of Uno's!
.... Much better though!"}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to say I ate the entire Brunch Pie myself and have been dreaming of it ever since. Yes, it's that good. It's basically a deep dish breakfast pizza with sausage gravy, cheddar cheese, shaved fingerling potato, and two over easy eggs on top and the best \"surprise\"... the maple drizzle. It's brunch perfection and I'd eat one everyday if I could.

I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Oh Iron Born how you stole my heart.

If you're a fan of pan pizza taken to awesome new levels of crispiness then get to Iron Born and try some beers from Smallman.  I love the pies here and the people slanging them are all top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Detroit-style pizza. My review of Smallman Galley pretty much covers my feelings, but I'd be remiss if I didn't add my opinion to Iron Born's own page. 

Iron Born's pizzas come with six square slices. I recommend trying two different styles of pie and swapping - that will provide more than enough for a meal and late night snack (or future meal)! The crust has just the right amount of crispiness without coming off too heavy (looking at you, Chicago-style - still love ya, though). 

On our visit over the summer we also ordered a salad to share, which I'd recommend skipping. Get your veggies elsewhere. Get your pizza here!"}
{"text":"Located in Smallman Galley, Iron Born Pizza offers an amazing take on pan pizza in a great foodie location within the Strip District of Pittsburgh. Chose the prosciutto pizza which came with fresh, thin sliced prosciutto, dressed arugula, shaved parmesan cheese and pistachios. The deep pan style pizza provides some of the best crust you will find and the fresh ingredients make this pizza absolutely amazing! When back the following morning for a coffee, scoped out the breakfast pizza which equally impressed visually and came with a sausage gravy, fingerling potatoes, carmellized onions and more.

The service for the pizza was quite fast particularly in light of the high demand at the Iron Born Pizza counter. Honestly, each and every pizza on the menu looked to be interesting and full of solid ingredients and you probably could not find a bad one on the menu."}
{"text":"Good Detroit style thick bread type crust with fresh toppings.  My Spicy Pie with hot Soppressata - Pepperoni - House Banana Peppers - Mike's Hot Honey - Red Pepper Flakes was very tasty and a nice combination of flavors.  The Full Chicken wings with dry rub were good and had more chicken meat then most wings that was very moist."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.

Iron Born Pizza, aside from having a very cool name, delivers really good tasting pizza.  Its the pizza of my childhood but much better.  It's the pan pizza that I think most restaurants wish they could be but can never get there.  I'm a bit partial to Neapolitan style pizza but I would be very happy eating Iron Born pizza any time.  What makes it so good?  For starters, the crust is just so flavourful, light, and yet has a great hearty crust that shatters a bit when you bite into it.  They call it Detroit style... I'll just call it very good.

Spicy Pizza - The ingredients were very plentiful and bold ... it made me quite happy eating it.  The spicy pizza had hot soppresata, pepperoni, banana peppers and the interesting addition of spicy honey.  It wouldnt be my first thought but I loved it after the first bite... you get the wonderful pork flavour, hit of the spice, and then this really nice sweetness at the end. 4.5/5

I loved the fact that you had a wonderful hot pizza literally in minutes and it was so affordable.  So if I had to come back to Smallman Galley, Iron Born would definitely be an order.  Perhaps the white pie next!"}
{"text":"I had gone here for a Yelp event and loved the pizza so I decided to come back as I was in the area anyway.
I had a thick crust pepperoni pizza with sauce on the top.
The pizza is amazing there and totally delicious.
Being from New York I am a bit spoiled as there are a ton of really good pizza places.
I would say Iron Born Pizza is among the best pizza i have ever had.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the area.
And I will definitely be going back again.
Only thing I can say is get there when there is no crowds as otherwise you could wait a while as the Spellman Gallery is very popular and gets crowded really fast."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza that I've had during my life.  It is Sicillian style and absolutely mind-blowingly crunchy.  Must try!"}
{"text":"If Detroit Pizza is your thing, go here. If Detroit Pizza isn't your thing, go here and it will become so. Absolutely delicious. 1 Pizza was enough for 2 people. Do yourself a favor and wash it down with some beer from the attached bar."}
{"text":"As the current class of Smallman Galley prepares to graduate I wanted to make one final visit there and experience a chef I hadn't eaten from. In this case it was Iron Born.

Chef Pete Tolman does an amazing job of creating pizzas with 6 cuts that can be shared with 2 or 3 people. My husband and I had \"garden\" style pizza. It is Detroit styled with a very thick crust but not overfilling.

Presentation was spot on and we both enjoyed sharing it. The sauce was flavorful and it was probably one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. You do have the option to \"create your own\" when giving your order.

A brunch pie is served on Sundays. The ordering concept is the same. You are given a number after you place your order and they will bring it to your table.

It is my hope that when Iron Born moves on they will remain in our city as a freestanding restaurant so that more people can enjoy an outstanding chef's concept on a simple dish such as a pizza.

The current class will complete their tenure at the end of May. Be sure to stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Iron born is dee-wishis. I started this review in September and...whoops, time got away from me, so I've now been here twice since then. Very pleased that the Detroit-style concept has now hit the streets in Pittsburgh. It's better than Chicago-style and..uh oh, here's where we possibly get sacrilege to all that is Pizza-fied in da burgh'...better than, dare I say.. Fiori's! :D

Michigan and Trumbull, at the new Federal Galley, is also just as good. Docking a star for price. No pizza that is 6 slices should be $18."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the best pizza's I've ever had! Full disclosure, I love thick crust pizza and prefer it over thin crust. So I'm happy to find a spot in the Burgh with thick crust pizza, considering most offer just thin crust. 

This is actually Detroit style pizza. I think one of the things that makes it special is they bake cheese into the crust that makes it crisp and delicious. Seriously, it's a genious attribute

I've had a variety of pizza, but my fave is probably the white pizza. The ricotta, arugula, caramelized onions, with a slight taste of lemon, really did it for me. I also enjoyed the spicy red pizza, although it wasn't killer spicy, so you won't be left chugging a gallon of water.

I had the red pizza as well, which is good, but if I'm gonna go all in, I want something special rather than just the basics. Friendly staff as well. Can't wait to see what they do once they're out of Smallman Galley. I feel like big things are in store!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza. I've had two different types of pizza.  First, I got the red pie.  Second time, I got the buffalo chicken, which was my favorite. I love how large the pieces are, and I also love the crunchy crust.  It's very obvious that the pizzas are crafted with the highest quality ingredients.  This chicken wasn't your average chicken that you see on faster paced pizza shops. It tasted like the chicken you would have on a rotisserie.  I look forward to trying something new next time.  I highly recommend!"}
