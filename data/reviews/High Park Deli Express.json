{"text":"Great local deli with awesome lunch/dinner options!  They do fresh sandwiches using bakery buns and slice to order deli meat! They also have a great hot table selection offering dishes like cabbage rolls, sausage roll and more!!!   Good prices and always delish!  Check it out if you're looking for a good bite by the park!"}
{"text":"Yummy authentic food.     Shy but very kind staff that truly were happy to show off their cooking"}
{"text":"I had one cabbage wrap, my daughter had a blind and some salad. We both liked the food. What a great little find by the High Park, especially for those who origin in Eastern Europe."}
{"text":"Great local deli.. Super tiny so there isn't much for seating but they do have a minj( and I mean tiny!) patio at front facing bloor.. The have a variety of meat sandwhich was for fair pricing and fresh meat! If go for a grab and go since seating  is limited. The woman who runs the shop is lovely and very friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh made sandwiches are always somthing i enjoy.  We had a roast beef sandwich which was piled high with delicious fresh cut beef and topped off with mustard and lettuce and cheese, and also a chicken breast sandwich topped with tomato, and mayo and lettuce & cheese.  They were really good and tasty.  On the side we had cabage rolls and roast potatoes, which were awesome.  This is some excellent eastern european deli going on here.  I'll be back because this is my kind of thing.  This stuff is like what my grandmother used to make.  Its the good stuff."}
{"text":"The pork schnitzel with the cheese blend on top is divine.  I have had this countless times and it is one of the tastiest things ever.  Also, great Deli."}
{"text":"Came in and saw a favorite of mine \"slodka chwyla\" instant polish warm jello. I love this stuff but when I checked the expiry date. 2014!!!!???!! So I guess all the pastries and luncheats must be from that year too.. beware of what you buy people. Go to Roncesvalles to benna's bakery instead if you want fresh unexpired food/sweets/desserts.."}
