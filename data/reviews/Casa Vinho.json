{"text":"This place is the kind of relaxed, quality neighborhood restaurant for which Montreal is renowned. We were on a visit to the city, and staying nearby, so we walked in on a weekend night to check it out. The menu is varied with a good selection of dishes, Portuguese wines and beers from Quebec microbreweries. That night the restaurant was full but not overcrowded, and my family and I enjoyed a very reasonably priced and tasty table d'hote (starter, main course and dessert) in a convivial atmosphere.   There's a kids' menu - smaller portions of the main dishes for $6 - that our daughter fully enjoyed.  On a language note, while the waitress spoke very little English, she did her best to explain the specials and the table d'hote while I translated for the rest of our party who did not speak French. So the language barrier was not a problem - good food and service is universal! The chef was also friendly and came over to chat with us on his rounds near closing, making us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"A cosy restaurant if you're in the mood to try a Portuguese restaurant that offers lot more than roasted chicken! Here you can find good fish and good meat! Ah! The desserts are veryyyy good: you can try the pastel de Nata ou natas do céu! Also... Good choice of Portuguese wines! Finally one thing that I love: kitchen is open to the dining room: you can see it all! Nothing to Hyde. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Recently tried out this cozy authentic Portuguese resto on Masson and really enjoyed their food. The resto is itself is small and can accommodate a group of 10. The resto walls are nicely decorated with portuguese scenery paintings which adds a nice touch to the decor. Perfect resto for friends or family gathering, birthday party or dinner for two. Service was friendly. I really enjoyed their portiguese grilled chicken and ribs combo. Chicken was perfectly grilled and was so moist and tasty!  Also had their grilled calmari...delicious!  Be sure to leave room for their delicious pastel des natas!  Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in town!!  Didn't expect much when we walked in to an empty restaurant on a Thursday night, but I walked out with a very satisfied stomach and great vibes!!  Alain is super friendly and attentive!  He's very patient and thoughtful. He explained the French menu to us English speaking customers.  Johnny (the owner and he's the only chef too!) is really skilled and his dishes are incredibly on point!  Love their fried calamari: super fresh and thinly battered; escargo appetizer: large portion of escargo meat in a brown creamy onion sauce--delicious!  Got the seafood trio with octopus, fish, and squid for myself and it was really good and flavorful!  We also had the dinner special with lamb chop and pork ribs--super tender and juicy!  Stir fried veggies were great and every thing else we ordered was awesome!! Will definitely come back next time when we're in town."}
{"text":"In our quest to find interesting ideas for a caterer for our wedding, my fiancé and I found ourselves somewhere pretty foreign to me: Masson street in Rosemont. I have been before - but mostly when I was a young kid visiting my great grandmother in the area. Otherwise, quite a dark zone in my city knowledge. We found ourselves there to visit Casa Vinho, a Portuguese restaurant working with wood charcoal - supplied by my future father-in-law - hence why we visited to see what maybe they could do for us from a catering point of view.   Casa Vinho is a family run restaurant that specializes in grilling on charcoal. The space is classic Portuguese restaurant decor - bright colors, lots of seaside paintings and other trinkets around Portuguese culture. Personally, I found the music a little too loud to have real conversation but otherwise no complaints.  Starting off, of course, I needed to go with the cod cakes. I can't imagine going to a Portuguese restaurant and not ordering these. Nice crunch on these and good flavours but not the texture I love. The cod had a very smooth, pureed texture. I like more of the filament-like texture of the cod to come through.  Our other entrée was some grilled calamari - served with a pepper salsa on top. The calamari was excellent - nice and fresh. Beautifully firm but tender texture. Grilled nicely as well. The salsa brought a hint of acidity and sweetness to the dish. Hit the spot nicely.  Our first main was grilled squid served with roasted vegetables, rice and the pepper salsa again. The squid was exquisite. Great fresh flavour, nice sear on the outside and nice tenderness in general. The salsa once again worked well with the dish and the sides were plentiful. This is the kind of squid I hope to get when I order some. Wonderful.  And then, of course, we have the Portuguese chicken. First thing - the portion is huge. Very generous for the price. As for the chicken itself, it is wonderful. The chicken is moist and juicy. The skin is nicely crisp and charred from being grilled over wood charcoal. As I am a weakling, I went with the less spicy sauce. Nice heat still but with a subtle finish. The classic sides of salad and fries were great as well. Exactly what you want from this dish. Excellent dish all around.  To finish, I needed to get my Pasteis de Mata. Classic and wonderful as always. Great hint of vanilla within the custard. Nice flaky crust. A perfect classic finish to a solid meal.  Casa Vinho was a solid experience from beginning to end. Classic Portuguese is always delicious when done well and they definitely strike the right notes. While we didn't go with them in the end for logistic reasons, I can definitely recommend them if you are looking for a nice meal in Vieux Rosemont.  Cheers!"}
