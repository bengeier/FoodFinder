{"text":"The service was horrible, the waiter was good the value of food for the money was totally unacceptable and manager refused to discount a refund. No meat other than fish and we have fish allergy so we paid forty dollars for carbs. I highly do NOT reckoned this place. If possible I would have rated zero stars."}
{"text":"Food was good they have some unique items on their menu fried potatoes and onions, mashed potatoes with bacon and onion and several kids of desserts in the regular buffet and dessert bar. One of our favorites"}

We had steak lobster and shrimp and ALL was under cooked . asked to send shrimp back or get a refund. Offered a 5 dollar gift card instead but never got it. Won't be going back there that's for sure."}

We asked about 4 times and right before closing they finally came to say that the cooks wouldn't remake the food because they had already taken it out and was given to the wrong table. I was offered my money back. Never coming here again."}
