{"text":"A vegetarian walks into a gourmet burger bar......and finds a fantastic portobello mushroom burger!  Delicious!  I was worried I was going to have to suck up an appetizer and fries.  Yay!  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Burgers were juicy and thick! Simple menu but everything is wonderful. Nice beer selection. Good Happy hour!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here for various reasons. The food is seriously good , the service is always amazing, and the prices are decent. Always a great place to go , but I like getting it to go so I can enjoy the great food at my house."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our waitress was extremely attentive! The food was phenomenal! I know in theory it's hard to go wrong with a burger but they don't always pack a punch and need the bacon and cheese to do the talking and here that was simply not the case. I got the N' Awlliwns(sp?) Burger and every bite was full of flavor! Let's not forget those awesome fresh cut fries either. It's a little pricy, which is my only complaint but it was worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Went last night fir first time. No draft beet which i found odd for a gourmet burger and beer place.
Had a ceasar salad which was very good - homemade dressing. The burger - 5 star burger on a 1 star bun. How hard is it to at least grill a kaiser bun for your awesome burgers?
The fry mix was very good but came lukewarm on my basket, like they make a big batch and they sit there for a while before plating,
Would have given a 4.5 rating but cant because of the cheapo bun and lukewarm limp fries. Details Bubba! And easy to fix"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a burger the other day and one of our friends suggested we give this place a try.  Although it is close to home we had not heard of it.  Well, we are very glad that we stopped in.  If you are looking for a delicious burger, this is the place.  The meat (which is a combination of brisket, prime rib and short rib) tasted fresh, flavorful and was cooked exactly as we ordered.  The fries were ok, but not great.  They were a combination of white and sweet potato but tasted a bit burnt.  As others have noted, for the quality of the burger, one would expect outstanding fries.  Nonetheless, the burger was great.  One of us had the fish sandwich, which given its size was more like a whale sandwich.  It was flaky, and tasted as fresh and delicious as the burger.  The place is just one open space with tables as well as a bar and a lot of TVs. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You can tell the owner put a lot of thought into every detail of the place and it shows.  I consider myself somewhat of a burger connoisseur, and this place is definitely tops for me.  The food brings me in, and the excellent service keeps me around!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more I guess based on reviews. Sat at the bar that was slightly stick and seemed cheaply constructed. I also notice their tap system consisted of two min fridges with taps. 

I got the buffalo chicken burger. I was expecting the fried chicken would add a crunch but was more soggy halfway through. 

The hot sauce was good. Different but good. It was more on the pepper spicy side than butter/buffalo tang.  

The burger itself was really good and cooked as ordered. 

I got the mixed fries (regular/sweet). I think I might have gotten only one type and half slightly over cooked. 

I would like to try again because of what I had read but might be a while."}
{"text":"Good service, *excellent burgers* and decent beer section. Decor leaves a lot to be desired, but what else can you say about a strip mall eatery?"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. And such a great selection. Had the one with a fried egg on it. Very pleasant people that wanted to make it more than just a \"stop in and grab a burger\" stop."}
{"text":"Today was oir first visit to Bubba's.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with honey BBQ which was outstanding.

The side of fries was lack luster but huge. It's a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. Unforunately, they were cold. Left-overs from the lunch rush? 

My guy had a cheese burger and loved, loved, loved it.

The fried pickles were tasty as well.

The waitress was friendlybut at times, service was a bit slow for the lack of crowd."}
{"text":"Great burgers, delicious zucchini! All fresh! Reasonable price, casual atmosphere. Takes much longer with a large group."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it \"gourmet\" and not worth the $10.99 charge. The bun for the burger was not good. It took too long for the burger to come out. The grilled zucchini appetizer was decent, but overpriced at $6.99. It's only grilled zucchini. Now I know to make it at home instead. The kids burger was average size for $5.99 and included a drink which was good. I wanted my kids to share the burger since they weren't that hungry. I asked the waitress to cut it and put it on two plates. The waitress said Bubba doesn't allow the staff to cut burgers in the back so I had to cut it myself and split it between the kids. I thought that was odd that they wouldn't just cut it in half for me. I didnt' order a beer, but their Craft beer selection was pretty impressive. The atmosphere was lacking much character. You can tell they didn't put much money in decorating or nice tables and chairs. For the prices they charge, the atmosphere should be nicer. I'd go to Burgatory next time over this place. Same prices, better atmosphere and better menu."}
{"text":"It was hard to decide one star or two. The food tasted good....the waitresses lack of knowledge & lack of social skills is why I won't come back. I was excited to eat here. I have Celiac, so it's hard to eat out! I asked our waitress about what I could have....she admitted she didn't know much about GF, but they had gluten free buns. And any of the burgers could be made gluten free. So I kinda thought she would ask if any apps. or something else was gluten free, but she didn't care enough to ask. So I went with a burger & zuchinni fries. The food tasted good. But when I got a closer look at my bun, it was charred black. Now the waitress said ahead of time....it will be toasted. So when I politely said \"uh it's not a big deal, but this is really burnt bad. For $2 extra for the bun that's not right.\" So she got pissed off & said \"I told you it would be toasted\" then walked away. I didn't want to cause a scene, I had my kid with me.....but I know what toasted is & this was closer to hockey puck. Her attitude was worse than the bun. If they are an allergy friendly place, then she should also be more informed or what people can or can't have. I did get my $2 back.....she said something pissy to me I didn't quite catch & tossed the check towards me. Like an idiot I left a decent tip. My mistake!"}
{"text":"Good variety of burghers. The beef they use here is very good and cooked to order. Good bruschetta for an appetizer along with fried pickles are two of my favorite apps here. Lots of TVs and a nice beer menu round out a better than average place to watch a game."}
{"text":"The new location at the highlands is wv is simply a nightmare. Poor service, poor food, poor experience. Im not alone. Check Facebook"}
{"text":"Great meal. I had the bubba burger and it was delicious. Cheese out the wazoo. Kids also enjoyed their meal. Terrific service and I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich on Fridays is awesome but be prepared to take some of that home. Burgers are very good but a little messy. They offer some great appetizers like grilled zucchini and a good variety of salads"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Pittsburgh area and drove up to see three rivers and the City of Pittsburgh for the first time today. My husband and I became hungry on our way home and was told about Bubba's so we stopped in to have a wee nosh for lunch. It was still quite early as they had just opened so it was pretty quiet which was fine by us. There were four TVs in front of us that had the Olympics on. We ordered our burgers. (I had the New Orleans) and our sodas. The meat was cooked perfectly.
 I asked for medium-rare and received medium rare. I also had the sweet potato fries of which were limp and on the cold side but they still tasted fantastic.
 Our server was Abby  she was on top of things. She answered all our questions in a perfect manner. 
We rarely go out for hamburgers and there is a chain that promotes Gourmet Burgers I won't name them yummm.
But they profess to be experts but they don't even come close to Bubba's. I wish this restaurant was a little bit closer but it's worth the drive believe me. So go and see Abby and tip her well"}
{"text":"The Bubba bugger was great!!! Great service very fast. Will come again. The portions were big you will come home with leftovers"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and excellent service from Chelsea.  Highly recommend the boneless wings and Bubba's Burgher.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered a couple of burgers & salads. Not impressed.  What's up with the buns?!  Soggy and burger fell apart before I could take the first bite.  Meat flavor ok, but fries bland.  Honey mustard chicken salad flavorful. but really skimpy on lettuce and overpriced.  Sadly service was uninspired. Never asked how the food was and didn't seem to care.  You would have thought they would have tried a little since the restaurant was just featured today in a South Hills paper.  Much better burger/value/experience elsewhere - ie Cafe Io in Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it! The bartender was really nice and helpful. The drinks okay, boyfriend got a margarita and it was way to sour. The food was great, I got the traditional burger but added mushrooms and they were the fresh good ones and they put them under the cheese which was great! Boyfriend got the burger with the artichoke aioli and it was great too. We want to try the zucchini next time as the bartender recommend it! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"If you like burgers and fries, this is the place for you. If you're really hungry, probably not the place for you. 

The food is delicious, but the kitchen cannot keep up. Pretzel and beer cheese appetizer arrived with the meal. The food was very good, but as an appetizer I had hoped this simple appetizer would arrive much earlier than 35 minutes. Since our server, who was great, warned us of the possibility, I don't think this is an isolated case.  I would go again, but no pretzels."}
{"text":"Our visit started by walking in the door to no greeting or service for at least 20 minutes. Once seated, the waitress was nice, but that was the extent of anything good from this. She had to of forgotten to put our order in because an hour later, still no meals. If a 5 year old is crying because it's been SO long and she's SO hungry, that's bad. Once the food came, the \"medium\" cooked steak was very well done, all our fries were all still freezing cold, the little ones grilled cheese was delayed yet AGAIN because it was burnt...and the one they brought was black too. You would think they would try to make good with this horrid situation by refunding at least one meal, NOPE!! Even as we were waiting for a check a party of 6 came in, waited so long to even be acknowledged, never happened and they stomped out. This place is way over rated..maaaany other places on Washington Pike to go, try them instead!"}
{"text":"Literally the best burg(h)er I've ever had. Delish! A total must if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got written up in our Mt. Lebanon community magazine (which is the only reason we'd make the trek to a different part of town for a staple like hamburgers). Good beer selection, but the food was mediocre.  Buns fell apart as everyone has commented.  Buffalo wings were watery.  Odd.   We returned two items, and the waitress was accommodating."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try Bubba's after driving past it for several years.  Nothing much to look at inside, but that's ok.  Decent beer selection and good menu choices.  I had the N'walins burger and wife had boneless chicken wings with chipotle dry rub. Burger was very good.  Nice and juicy and cooked nicely.  Chicken was a tad overcooked, but still good.  We also had the fried pickles.  They were pretty greasy but after draining they were really tasty.  Lots of them, also.  My fries were not greasy."}
{"text":"Bob D

EXCELLENT!!  Best burger we have had in a very, very long time!  Cooked to perfection ( mine-medium rare and wife-very well done!!)!!  We will be going back, definitely!"}
{"text":"The fries were good. It's a mix of sweet potato and russet potato. I don't eat meat and they offered me a portabella burger. It was okay, a little too greasy for my taste. But, it is a burger place that specializes in... Burgers"}
{"text":"I had the Bacon Ranch Burgher and it was really delicious; so were the fries! My only complaint was that, although they had a ton of beer choices, they didn't have as good of a LOCAL beer selection as I'd hoped for. Service was great even though they were fairly busy."}
{"text":"I may have just had a bad experience but the only time I was there the burger was horribly over cooked. The only reason I even give them two stars is because the fries were pretty good. Over all I think it could be improved."}
{"text":"Really good and unique burgers for the area.  Surprisingly to me the buffalo chicken bites were awesome as well.  Beer selection is solid and priced appropriately."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burger places in Pittsburgh.  Way better than Sauce which is right down the road.  The service was exceptional.  The chilli was amazing.  My wife had the New Orleans burger, and I had the Western.  Both were perfect.  Fries were good.  Server was great.  Not a single complaint.  Btw this was the second time I've been here."}
{"text":"I liked this place but wasn't wild and raving about it. I ordered their classic burger with pepper jack cheese and done medium. I took a bite and noticed how greasy it was. The fries were a little bit tougher than I thought. I got a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries, but really couldn't tell the difference. 

Their beer selection was par. Only wished there would have been more local brews. 

The service was fair, at best. It really bothered me that after we were done eating, she brought over the check without asking if we wanted anything else. There was no desert menu that I saw, but what if I wanted to order another side or have another beer?"}
{"text":"Used to be our go-to place for a burger in the south hills, not any more. Was there last Saturday evening at about 6:00 (was busy, but not packed) and the service was terrible. I can't say the the wait staff was bad, just overwhelmed with no direction. I would have had more than two beers if I could have gotten ahold of the waitress. There is no management here at all and it's obvious. The place is also cold and dirty.  

The grilled zucchini was good, but took forever to get. The burgers not good, overcooked and dry. They also changed the buns for the worst not to mention they were cold like they just pulled them in the back door from the cold January night it was. 

Sad to say we won't be back. There are just too many other burger places around with better food, atmosphere and attentiveness for the same price.

Adios Muchachos!"}
{"text":"Open dining area with the bar on one side. Flat-screen tv's adorn the walls. The atmosphere isn't great, but they make do with what they have. Our waitress was prompt and friendly. Decent, but not great beer selection, although seeing Moosehead and Magic Hat was nice. 

I ordered the N'awlins Burgher, which the menu described as cajun-seasoned with chipotle mayonnaise, bleu cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The seasonings were barely noticeable, the bleu cheese had little flavor, and the buns were almost but not quite as good as week-old Town Talk sandwich bread. The burger wasn't bad, but for a supposed gourmet burger restaurant, I wanted it to be a lot better than it was.

The fresh-cut fries, however, were bad. They were colder than room temperature and relatively tasteless. Drowning them in Frank's Red Hot did little to improve them. I ate about 1/4 of them. 

Overall, Bubba's was disappointing. Again, it isn't bad, and the prices are reasonable. The problem, though, is that there are many, many other places with better burgers and significantly better fries. I don't regret eating here, but I don't need to ever go back."}
{"text":"The best burgers in Pittsburgh. You name it they make it. We met Bubba the other night and he was great."}
{"text":"Best burger in the Burgh!  Worst French fries I've ever had! All 5 of us agreed on that.  With such high quality burgers the fries were absoulutly disgusting."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious , fresh burgers and great selection to choose from. The grilled zucchini is amazing. Thumbs up:)"}
{"text":"The food is good, they only had two severs working when I had lunch. Abby was hustling but the server was not. If they would have had more help they would have received a 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!! My husband and I recently moved into the area and happily stumbled upon this gem. Great food, good beer selection, friendly staff. Now a regular spot for us! Get there!"}
{"text":"Very good food and very nice staff, the owner was there and was very nice, I suggest that you get the mix fires which is sweet potatoes and regular fires"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was more of a bar until I got there and saw all the TVs and the general setup of the place. I honestly don't care about a restaurant's decor generally but one thing that does irritate me about a place is when, no matter what direction you are sitting, you're facing a tv. That paired with the very loud volume made it a little difficult for discussion but that's my only complaint.

We ordered the grilled zucchini as an appetizer and although it took longer than expected, was definitely worth the wait. The balsamic glaze was all I could have hoped for and more, and it paired perfectly with the slightly charred taste of the zucchini. Can I also please say it's SO nice to see an appetizer that's not deep fried!

For my meal I had the Nekkid Burgher which is basically a burger on a bed of field greens with slices of mozzarella and tomato and my beloved balsamic glaze. It was a little more of a salad than a burger, but that's not a complaint from me. I was pretty pleased although there was a little but too much glaze added for my taste even though it was delicious.

My date got a more traditional looking burger with a bunch of toppings and sauces that he said he fully enjoyed. He liked everything except the, as he worded, \"nothing special\" bun but he didn't even care he just ate it without the bun and was happy about it. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  I love that the meat is ground in house daily.  The zucchini is also amazing.  Excellent service and very child friendly.  My only suggestion is that I wish I didn't need to practically beg for a rare cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tasting burgher meat I've ever had.  The steakhouse burgher is my favorite but try them all!  You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Love this place. The best burger I have ever had and GREAT service too. It is a place we bring all our out of town visitors."}
{"text":"I got the bacon & ranch burger. Delicious. Bacon was cooked just right, and they substituted bleu cheese per my request for no additional charge. Burger was cooked just the way I like it. Their French fries are different from most places. Regular fries are mixed with sweet potato fries. It sounds iffy, but it's super good. I asked for ranch as a dipping sauce for the fries, and was charged an additional 75 cents. That's the only reason they don't get five stars from me."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, but hot damn is everything greasy! We ordered the fish sandwich, a regular cheeseburger, onion rings, and fried pickles. I ended up with a tiny (I'm talking TINY) crumb of batter from the onion rings on my shirt and didn't notice it right away. I did notice the grease stain that was about 3x the size of the crumb that was left after I brushed it away. We ended up boxing up the leftover onion rings and pickles, and the box was a giant greasy mess by the time we got home. 

The fish was really good, though. And the burger was just okay. I ordered it medium-well and it was dry as a bone. 

The four items we ordered came to $44 after a 15% tip. A bit pricey for lunch, but no big deal. The absolutely worst part has to be trying to get out of their parking lot, though. Traffic is outrageous in this part of Bridgeville.

It's obscenely loud, even for a sports bar. We could barely hear each other talk from across the table. Also, a tip for the restaurant, if you're going to have 6+ televisions on mute, you should really consider putting the closed captioning on. 

I'd still recommend it, though, just because I grew up listening to John Dave Bubba Shelly every morning on B94 before school. Bubba is always there, but I've yet to see him interact with any customers. He's usually on his phone. The servers are really great, though."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu of burgers. I had the Bubba Burgher with Mushrooms. They cook extra cheese so that it overflows over the burger and plate. Only issue I had was that I ordered Medium and got Well. It was still juicy and flavorful.  My wife got the BBQ burger and both our burgers came with a French Fries and Sweet Potato Fries. We shared a Buffalo Chicken dip App with fried Pita chips. Good stuff though."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer,the burgers are fresh,frys our just ok,price. 's our not to bad .the crowd is not bad..we have tried most of the burgers.N'awlins burger is the best"}
{"text":"Love the burghers! Quick service, good food. What more to ask!
Been here couple of times for lunch with coworkers and everyone loves it. If only it was closer, i would turn into a regular. It looks like a good place to drink and watch the games."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.I have a soft spot for strip mall restaurants because a lot of times, they're diamonds in the rough. However, Bubba's was not that. 

I'll start off with the pros. Bubba's has a decent space and there is a nice selection of beer, making it a great place for watching sports. The menu is also creatively written and for the most part, well executed in terms of ingredients and how they go together. 

By the looks of it, Bubba's seemed like a promising burger joint. Until I took one bite of my burger and then another. Every single bite I took had at least one chunk of bone, which really ruined my appetite after finding about 10 chunks of bone. I'm willing to forgive one or two pieces of bone but it's really off putting when there is bone in every single bite. I could not finish my burger for the fear of chipping a tooth. My husband's burger was equally filled with bits of bone and neither could he finish his burger. Perhaps this is was an isolated incident. However, I don't think I'll return either way, in the event this is the norm."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!!! I haven't tried them all but I will. The fries are so delicious. The service is fantastic. The atmosphere is great. The restaurant is clean as well as the bathrooms. And Bubba, the owner, is very approachable . Try this place, you'll love it too."}
{"text":"As always my meal was the best. My burger was fantastic as well as the zucchini app. I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last week. Had an Octoberfest draft and a buffalo chicken burger special! It was great. Service was fast. I'm not 100% crazy for the sweet pot fries but the French fries are great and the server said to try the chili next time for sure. As Bubba on 100.7 Star says, Love u."}
{"text":"It was OK. Not sure I would recommend it not sure I would ban it, it is pricey 3 burgers, 3 soft drinks and 2 beers with tip $80.00"}
{"text":"Had a party of 10 for lunch. Group ordered a variety of burgers, beers and apps. Everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because the owner was featured in the local paper. I thought what an asset to the community and the Pittsburgh area he is. I want to patronize the business of a man like that. The service was great and friendly, our waitress was very nice. She recommended a coconut mojito which was excellent.  Also, when I got the bill I was pleasantly surprised by the price, around  $5. I'm accustomed to paying twice that. My wife and I both ordered burgers and liked them. Mine was a bit overcooked for my taste, but I should have ordered it medium instead of medium well. I'll take the blame for that. They took some time to come out. Not sure if it just took that long to cook or they sat for a while as the fries were not really hot. Overall it was an enjoyable meal, even though I gave it three stars. I would return as I am a member of the community and really liked the mojito!"}
{"text":"today was my first visit to Bubbas .....Where should I start

Place is a lot smaller than I thought it would be but not cramped. waitress greeted us in a timely manner and got our drink order. Menu isn't huge but still has a lot of option I got a bowl of Chili as an app and the pulled pork and fries ...wife got a burger and fries. The chili took FOREVER to come out and when it finally came it wasn't hot but barely even warm ...the cheese ddint even melt on it. My pulled pork wasn't bad but DRENCHED in sauce which ...I mean the sauce was decent but becomes a little much when the pork is swimming in it. For the double order of fries that came with it ...wasn't that many fries which was a bummer. My wife said her burger was good and so were her fries BUT she wanted a side of ranch which the waitress brought......Then we were charged 0.75 for it on the bill.....and there was NEVER a mention of it when we asked for it or anything ...WTF?????????????? If you choose to go be prepard for a typical burger place nothing mind blowing"}
{"text":"Great, unique burgers. Frequented by local South Fayetters. I had the \"Bob the fun guy\" burger."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the buzz is about. Tried it for lunch with a coworker and found it to be loud, cramped and hard to find a parking space. Burger was ok, but everything was very greasy. I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on 10/31. Small but very nice, good beer selection and the \"Bubba burger \" straight up awesome!!!! If you like excessive amounts of cheddar cheese this is the burger for you!! Onion rings were fantastic as well. Must stop!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in South Fayette.  Highly recommend any dish that uses their amazing ground beef including the nachos.  Love the made to order buffalo chicken dip.  Have been eating here since they opened and will go back for years to come."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED the mix of sweet potato and regular fries for a side! Nachos were my favorite part of my whole meal! Basically, the menu is great; looks and sounds fantastic! So many interesting ideas; however i was a little disappointed with my burger. It was good, but my burger (N'Awlins burger) was a little dry and because i wanted it well done, it was a little to crisp to me. Anyhow, it was a great bar restaurant. It's an extremely small place, so the wait was a little horrendous, but it could have been worse!"}
{"text":"Hello,

In the last few months we've seen the drastic turnover in your employees. We've also witnessed the downgrade in your product and service. 

Last night we ordered 3 burgers and 1 came out 5 minutes before mine and my wifes. My wifes burger was burnt and my sons had onions on it instead of straws. 


My fries were soggy and cold and not the sweet potatoe fries I ordered. My burger had a tinge of burn on it. 


There were no more wings which I understand but there was also no aioli sauce, no horseradish, beer cheese and like 2 or 3 other items.


Quite frankly Kings is now making a better burger than you with their improved burger options."}
{"text":"I find Bubbas to be way overrated and just not really worth it. I got a some burger, not really memorable that's why I can't remember the name. It was greasy,  but cooked to my specifications. The fries where not cooked right. It was like they where added to the grease when the grease wasn't hot enough yet, a case of soggy fries.

I stopped in again, but just to have a beer because traffic was so bad. I won't eat here unless some else would pay for it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I think the burgers are pretty good. Tonight The Bubba Burgher was fantastic. Ordered medium and cooked perfectly. 
Let's talk about the fries... Not the greatest. They were a little limp and could've used another minute or two in the fryer. Also, they add what I believe is a smoked salt. Sometimes a little goes a long way. Too much. 
Jackie was a fantastic and friendly bartender. I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!! Great new addition to the menu potato salad. It was fantastic. We even got to meet Bubba!! He was very gracious and welcomed us!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Some of the best burgers in town, a great selection of beers, and wonderful staff.  I've eaten there several times now and not once have I been disappointed.  MUCH better than a couple other local places that I won't mention by name, and certainly better than any chain."}
{"text":"Good quality meat.  Crap décor.  I enjoyed my burger.  Again, awesome meat.  I like mine very rare, the burger came out very rare.  If you like good hamburger, with a very very very casual décor, then you've a great place.  I do prefer Sauce if you're going  for a burger in Bridgeville.  I like the Sauce atmosphere better and I prefer their mac and cheese options..  otherwise, Bubba's is a solid quality burger place to get in, eat and then leave.  The atmosphere is hard to describe without offending people."}
{"text":"Very bar/restaurant. More restaurant. Much family oriented. Such clean. Staff was wow. Very helpful. Burger was wow. Not as wow as competition (such Burgatory, much BRGR) but the wow service fills void."}
{"text":"Super delish, great staff, my husband and I had the slider sampler and all 3 rocked.... Messity is most definitely a necessity.... (Suggested and coining that term :-p. -TM(?) ). Unlike most pittsburghians, We came from over the river and thru the woods, Definitely worth the trip..."}
{"text":"On a fun-filled Saturday during my own personal burger weekend, my friend and I decided  that we had time to check out Bubba's for possible takeout after drooling over the menu (even though we had already hit up two other burger hot spots earlier in the day).  

The location in a strip mall is odd.  Which kind of goes with the decor.  The bar makes sense, but there is no buffer between the bar and the tables in the dining area.  It seems a bit awkward and random.  

Since we decided on takeout, we sat at the bar to enjoy a beer while we waited.  Our bartender was very attentive and was eager to explain the menu.  They really hype the freshness here and pride themselves on not having a freezer.  I decided on the Bubba Burgher with fries, my friend on the Fresh Burgher with grilled zucchini.  

I agree with many reviewers about the buns.  Bubba's is serving up some gourmet meat on some cheap buns that just aren't up to the task of containing these delicious burgers.  It seems a shame.  I ended up discarding most of the bun and just eating my Bubba Burgher with a knife and fork.  I did enjoy my mix of fries but that grilled zucchini my friend got was amazing.  Both of these items seem to be of some debate with other reviewers, but ours, even eaten later as takeout, were still good.

I'm currently giving Bubba's a solid 3 stars.  It was a tough decision on what to order the first time which only means I'll have to go back to try something else.  I'm hoping I'll be able to improve my rating with a return visit."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting more, but... the burger was dry and the fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting for a while. My daughter had the pasta with butter and the pasta came out cold and there were little, hard balls in the pasta. But our server was very attentive and nice!"}
{"text":"Burgers were tasty and fresh!! Not bad! Fries a lil salty. Sweet potato fries were tasty. The cheese on the bubba burger was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good both times we ate here. The burgers are excellent , I had the one with blu cheese and bacon and I can't stop thinking about how good it tasted. They offer sweet potato fries, regular fries or both. I got the combination of the two and actually loved the sweet potato fries more."}
{"text":"Good onion rings, nice beer selection, terrific burgers. I had the Fun Guy Burger which was very good but I also agree maybe an upgrade on the bun would be advised. Make sure you read the description of the items on the menu before you order. My daughter was very surprised to find that her Buffalo Chicken Burger was really Bison with fried chicken skin and buffalo sauce on top. Very unique burger which she liked!
   Also nice to see radio personality Bubba there overseeing the lunch crowd service!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Bubbas Burghers, food was fantastic, my husband wanted to swim in the beer cheese, so awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, seating sucked. Chairs are as hard as a rock. Nice atmosphere, music and 6 flat screens. Only complaint is the seating, need more comfortable chairs. We will definitely eat here again. Our waitress Shannon was super nice, but she was definitely understaffed. She did an awesome job for not having alot of help."}
{"text":"The food is always good!! We go there pretty often. Because we know we will get a good meal!! I always get the chicken salad with honey mustard dressing."}
{"text":"First Time at Bubba's. It was delicious and the waitress made great recommendations. Thanks for everything."}
{"text":"Must preface this with I tried to send this via \"contact\" on their website several times with no indication it went through.  So here goes...

Bubba... Don't know where to start but I feel you need the feedback so here goes.  This is the second Friday in a row we have visited your Southpointe location.  The first week our intentions were purely to grab a few drinks prior to a game we were attending next door.  After a lengthy wait along the \"wall\" overlooking the ice, we were approached by a waitress who took our order with the understanding we were in a bit of a hurry.  Interesting enough, we received our bill before we received our drinks that arrived 15 minutes later.  While you were \"busy\" I would not have said you were overwhelmed.  We made it to our game a bit late.  It took us thirty minutes in all to get a drink once we were on the wall. 

Tonight, we arrived well before our 9 o'clock start with hopes that our dining experience would better.  I am sad to tell you it was actually worse.  After being seated, it took us nearly 25 minutes to get a drink, including the waters we ordered.  From there, our food order was delayed significantly causing us to be late once again for our intended game next door.  We were made aware of a large party only after we waited for about 45 minutes longer and watched meal after meal being delivered.  We ordered chicken nachos for God's sake... And they arrived like fajitas.  There were three large chunks of chicken breast on top of the nachos that I had to dice into bite size pieces to make them edible.  The quality of the food was good.  The service from start to finish was bad, two weeks in a row.  There are competing businesses just a short drive up the hill that we intend to patronize given our past two experiences.  While every \"new\" place has its growing pains, I would have expected a seasoned business to be more prepared for a cliental that you would hope to win over.  You were there running food... quicker than you servants I must admit.  But as the face of the business, perhaps you should be spending more time preparing the raw employees you have in customer service. Truly hope you view this feedback as a gift... did not want to put it out on Yelp as we have had many dinners at your Bridgeville location and have been fond of the food quality."}
{"text":"There is not one possible complaint I could have about this place.  When looking for somewhere different to go for a birthday lunch, Bubba's was the first to come to mind.  

Everything from the food to the employees had surpassed my expectations.  We started out lunch with the Fried Pickles, which were excellent!  I then accidentally spilled two glasses of water all of the table and floor.  The staff were so kind and helpful to have everything cleaned up.  I felt awful but they continued to reassure me that this was not an issue, nor the first or last time that this would probably happen.  

I ordered the N'Awlins burger, after changing my mind about 5-6 times prior to ordering.  I was very pleased wit my choice.  The chipotle mayo mixed with the bleu cheese was perfection!  

I will definitely be making another trip out to this location and will definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try something new!

Thanks for everything!!!"}
{"text":"Ok.. burgers.. simple menu. Good service. Pricey for Bridgeville area local. Friendly staff.."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 4 times in the last 3 months.  The burgers are quality and there is a variety of selections.  I enjoy the fries.

Still have a problem with the layout of the serving area as you are literally eating in a large storefront.

For the prices charged, I would prefer a divided eating area."}
{"text":"So first of all let me say, the bartenders are the best!!
And the burgers are great
But the night I stopped, it was slow and they ran out of everything, cheese, honey, a few beers...
It seems like they just kind of let this place go
I remember when it opened it was always busy and the food was really good
It's falling fast
I gave it three stars because even the bartenders knew it was a mess and apologized several times
It was also the funny at one point after sometime tried to order several different things on the menu and she just kept saying \"sorry\" were out of that too...
The Cajun burger I had was really good tho but they need some management help asap"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had there yet. The burger is huge, juicy, with a nice charred crust on the outside. Fries are so-so, but who cares; I am there for the Bubbaburger, and I left Bubba's stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"I am not a pretentious burger guy but I found my burger to be amazing.   First - The story on the back of the menu says a lot.   Bubba grew up as a meat guy.  Anyone who knows a great burger understands that a burger is not all ground beef.   There are certain amounts of pork in a burger.

My burger - The Bonino, Bonino, Bonino Burger

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RBtw01TZfo

Is a special aptly named after our Hockey Star :)  It is a blend of burger, sausage, grilled onions, and provolone cheese.   It is served with fresh cut sweet potato and traditional fries.

I have a new burger place :)   

Btw they have a pretty good beer selection."}
{"text":"Bubbas burgers are very good. I had a classic burger with cheddar cheese cooked medium. It was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. When I bit into the burger however, it crumbled everywhere and was a bit of a mess. The bread tasted a little bit stale.

The meal comes with a side of fries. You can get sweet potato fries, regular or mixed. My husband tried the regular and I tried their sweet potato fries and we can confidently say they are both equally disgusting. For the two reasons that would make anyone cringe.. They were soggy AND cold...

The server was pretty stoic and uninterested. The atmosphere is lack luster. There are lots of flat screen tvs to draw your attention away from the horrible paint job. I never understood why restaurants don't give walls an extra coat of paint."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and fries.  The bun was just okay.  Atmosphere also ok.  Very loud.  The burgers with fries are $11.  But the burger was worth it."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best burgers in the Pittsburgh area. You get to build your burger and select from the ingredients on the menu for one price.. Everything is fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Terrible! There was SOOO much oil on the zucchini. The \"onion strings\" (the reason I ordered the burger I did) were really chopped up onion rings (not even close to the same thing - even Red Robin can get that one right), they were out of something for the burger my boyfriend wanted, the fries had NO seasoning on them (though it's much hyped in the menu) - correction, my boyfriend found 4 in his entire plate that had a LITTLE seasoning. I didn't eat mine, but kept looking for even a speck of seasoning and found none. The service was also horrible. There are tons of better places and most bars have better food. Save yourself the trouble.

I think the people who rated this highly have never had a burger at a steak place or a really good burger place. I've been to a lot of them. The worst burger place in Vegas is better. Goto Fuddrucker's if there's one around and it's better. Perhaps those who reviewed this positively were drinking enough that they didn't really care and thought anything was amazing. I'm baffled by the high ratings."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Bubba's and it was a great experience! The food was very good and our server Denise was wonderful."}
{"text":"While I love Burgatory, Tessaro's, and Wingharts, the best burger in the Pittsburgh area in my opinion is here.  I get the steakhouse burger every time and have never been disappointed.  It is always cooked exactly to order and the flavors are perfectly balanced.  My wife and I also got the buffalo chicken dip which is very good as well.  

The atmosphere is laid back and fun.  Service is always fast as well.  Our server, Carly was extremely friendly and great at her job."}
{"text":"Started off with the grilled zucchini which wasn't bad but the experience is lessened when everything is served on Styrofoam plates.  You can't really say you are gourmet anything when you don't use regular plates and mostly disposable products.  

Service was OK but Bubba, where I have an issue is when you order a burger medium and it's is served with no pink inside, that's well done.  Especially when the burger is dry.  The tomatoes in the burgher salad had no flavor either.  Looked good but they ruined the taste of the dish.

Bubba, I love your morning show, but your burger joint needs a bit more tlc to get it back up to par. Competition in the city restaurants is getting tougher and your product needs to step up a few notches.  Sorry, have to be honest.

Perhaps think about having some secret shoppers come in periodically to report back to you."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers are becoming a Pittsburgh staple. And i LOVE them. 
This place has excellent burgers & fries. really good beer selection .......but the NOISE is overwhelming at times. I kinda felt like I was on display in the front room. and some of the reviewers were right about the parking and traffic here ., but overall , I'm a fan , and I'll be back .....Soon !"}
{"text":"In the area for work and decided I could use a burger and a beer. The burger was amazing and cooked just like I ordered. Better than the food was the service from the bartender Carley, she was polite and so helpful in explaining options and making recommendations. Will definitely return when back this way. Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and both times it was great! The burgers are amazing and pretty good fries too! So far the steakhouse burger is my favorite.  I'm happy we decided to try this place out and will be returning whenever we are in the mood for a good burger!"}
{"text":"Had heard about this place from friends & figured we'd try it out. Glad we did.

The wife had the N'Awlens Burgher & loved it. I had the KCCO Burgher. The KCCO has 3 different kinds of cheese, sauteed portabellos, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, & a large deep fried onion ring. As if this isn't enough, they then add some of the best pulled pork I've ever had to it. Enough fell out when I picked it up to feed somebody. DELICIOUS!!!

You have a choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or a mix of the two. Get the mix because both are great.

Music is a little loud, but I have no issue with that.

I'll be back & hopefully soon."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you're looking for a home made, good quality, greasy burger- then I highly suggest Bubba's!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had a n'awlins burger and a Sam Adams Octoberfest. The burger was cooked perfect at medium and was very high quality. The toppings were a bit messy but very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best burger and fries in a casual setting not to mention the wings and the ribs this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great burghers! Small spot but that's ok. I like the fact that they don't have a freezer and all the meat is brought in fresh daily. I had the buffalo chicken burger and it was good. The chicken skin was interesting haha. The wife had the fresh burgher and my daughter had the hangover. All original ideas for burgers.

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food amazing. Waitress recommended the New Orleans burger and it was full of flavor. Was thrilled that sweet potatoes fries were the default side since I normally pay extra for them. Dipped in their chipotle mayo, the complete meal was 5 Star."}
{"text":"So been hearing about this place for quite awhile now. Finally got a chance to try it this past Saturday. Had a guys weekend planned with my buddy & my son and I told them we got to go to Bubba's!  We drive 40 minutes from the North Hills, to this place in the Bridgeville area, and it was well worth the drive!

When we arrived it's was packed, and there was a good size waiting list going, but were happy to wait to try their food. After about five minutes three spots at the bar opened up, where you can order food just as easily as at the table, so we took advantage of it and sat down and ordered our meal and some cold beers.

They had a great choice of appetizers and other things to eat, but we were there for those great burgers I had heard so much about.  My buddy got the N' Awlins Burger, which he devoured in seconds and commented that that was the best burger he'd had in a long, long time, and worth the extra cost of paying for a gourmet burger.

My son had the Bacon Ranch Burger along with Idaho fresh cut, thin fries with ranch powder, and loved every tasty bite of his meal.

I enjoyed the amazing Bubba's Steakburger which was tender, juicy and full of flavor!  It had caramelized Portabella mushrooms & onions, lettuce & tomato, and a great special sauce. It came with a combination of fries which included both Idaho & Sweet Potato.  They were fresh, and very good.

Bubba's has a great selection of craft & brand beers, as well as a couple of nice draft beers on tap.  I enjoyed a nice Oktoberfest draft beer with my meal.

Our bartender/server, Tina, was friendly and helpful with a very pleasant smile.  She loves working there, and is a great complement to the establishment.

It was nice to see Bubba working the kitchen window and delivering our orders. You can tell he loves what he does, and his big smile & personality shows it!!  
Got a chance to talk to Bubba for a couple minutes and shared with him my idea for a great burger for this time of year, the \"Zombie Burger\"!  Bubba said he loved the concept, and would put it on the menu soon. Told me to bring my wife & son down soon for a couple Zombie Burgers on the house, as his way of saying thanks for sharing.

Bubba's creativity, enthusiasm & energy is what makes me know this place will continue to be successful for a long, long time to come. We begged him to open a second Bubba's in the North Hills of Pittsburgh, and told him he would kill it there too!  Till that day comes.... we will be back here to this location to enjoy more delicious, gourmet burgers & fries, and look forward to trying some of the other items on their menu including both the chili, and wings, which I hear are fantastic too!

Thanks Bubba's for a great visit and meal."}
{"text":"We visited Bubbas while on a trip east with my daughter's school. After a very long day, we were all tired, hungry, and looking for something other than what we couldn't find at home. We were all incredibly impressed with the quality of the food and the creative ideas on the menu. The kids all found specialty burgers that they loved, and the staff handled our large party with poise and grace. Most restaurants balk at a large group of teenagers, but not your staff. Thank you, Bubba's, for feeding our kiddos and giving us all great memories of a fun dinner out!"}
{"text":"Beast burgers in Pittsburgh. Made from top quality cuts of beef cooked to order. And don't forget to order the zucchini!"}
{"text":"Okay. So Pittsburgh has like ten places that you go for burgers. There's your household names with their milkshakes, and your bread and butter places scattered throughout the area that are kind of like little secrets that some people know about, but they don't want to share. 

Bubba's is that. 

But I'm gonna share. 

J and I walk in on what we would assume would be a slow Tuesday night. They were busy! But not too busy to not get our food out super fast! Shannon was right on it with making sure our burghers were perfect. 

Josh got the Hangover. What on earth is that!? Where does someone come up with the idea to put a cheeseburger on french toast!? It was like a party. In your mouth. I can't really describe it's awesome. 

My burgher was the Bacon Ranch. Wowza, that was good too! I asked for it medium, and it was just that! 

I'm sure we'll be back to eat the rest of the menu. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"...stopped in with my son over the weekend. I give them 2 stars for effort. Though they only have two beers on tap they have a good bottle selection. Do not get the nachos! They are of the homemade variety that loose the crunch the second the Philly cheese sauce hits it."}
{"text":"I have had my share of burgers in my 53 years but, this may be the best I've ever had. I don't say that lightly. The hamburger itself had way more flavor than most. I had the steakhouse as well as tasting the arti cap. Both had a unique combination but the burger was still the star. I'm not from here local and have seen reviews for other local or Pittsburg burger joints , I can not compare this to those as I've not been to the others. I will say if you want a top quality burger you will be happy here."}
{"text":"This place has excellent burgers. They are made fresh and you can taste the quality. Had the N'awlins burger last time I was in and it was perfect, just the right amount of spice and a wonderful mix of flavors. Bubbas is, hands down, the best place to get a burger in this area.  The French fry/sweet potato mix is good and it's nice that you have the option of getting one or the other. I have also had their grilled zucchini appetizer before and recommend it highly, as it's delicious. This place does get very crowded at times, so you're best option is to hit it during off hours or place a takeout order."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Burger meat is some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. 6 pepper burger is my personal favorite. The chili is awesome, with more meat and less beans which I'm all for. Come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. I am not a burger girl, so I never let my husband suggest here. Wow, I've been missing out. You can get a chicken breast on any sandwich rather than a burger patty. DELICIOUS. They also have Buffalo chicken dip & fresh cut fries, mmm. 

Lots of good beers on tap, especially if you like IPA.

Our server, Carley, was extraordinary! Friendly and personable. She is fantastic at her job."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  Burgers were great,  all cooked perfectly to order.  The grilled Zucchini app was DA Bomb.  Mix of sweet potato and Reg potato fries were yummy. Would have been 5 stars but the chili was way too spicy for my taste buds and I like my fries crispier"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here!!!!! Starting off with O-rings for an appetizer,  they're the size of donuts!!! We had the Bubba burger and the Kccco burger,  both delicious with a side of regular and sweet potato fries!!! Great burger joint in Bridgeville!!"}
{"text":"The beer was cold and unfortunately so were our burgers! I still feel they deserve 5 stars though...the flavor...the juiciness  and the freshest of toppings put these perfectly cooked burgers over the top. The fresh cut Idaho fries were amazing!  I found my new favorite burger place in the Burgh. The fact that it was busy, even in the late afternoon tells me something and probably attributed to the luke warm burgers...but the wait staff was good and did their best to get orders out quickly...Hey everyone has a bad day..but their finished product is pure perfection in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been  here a few times and I have had nothing but pleasant experiences."}
{"text":"We tried Bubba's after church for lunch. They are a restaurant but also have a full bar. I tried the Classic burger because if you can't do a basic burger well the toppings are there just to hide that fact. I ordered my burger Medium and it came out cooked perfectly. It's nice that you have options on your side. You can get all regular French fries, all sweet potato fries, a mixture of both, or fried pickles. I went for the pickles and it was a good choice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Off night: fries cold..then when brought back half the size...my moms burger was ordered med well and was bloody..never this bad before..zucchini was VERY salty"}
{"text":"We were in Bridgeville and hungry for a burger for lunch, and after reading reviews we decided to try Bubba's. We both ordered the classic burger and the potato/sweet potato mix french fries.  I ordered mine medium well and it was perfect. It was flavorful with just enough chargrilled texture and taste. The size of the burger and bun seemed appropriate.  We did not feel like we over ate.  I also liked that the bun was not buttered.  Based just on the burger, we will return. 

The fries were also very good. I really liked the mix offering.  I probably would have been happier with half the amount. They were so good I couldn't help but eat them all!

Oddly, the classic is not on the menu so you have to ask for it. Thankfully, another yelper mentioned the classic or I would have been struggling because I just wanted a basic burger."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. A PA burger connoisseur's paradise. Everything is made fresh on site. No freezer and no microwave. I had the Sriracha Burger medium rare. The fries are PA fries and cooked to go on the burger. (Why? Stop putting fries on everything) The kitchen knows what they are doing. Ask for Erica. Enough said."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night to watch the UFC ppv. Fast friendly service at the bar. Only food I ordered were the fries which were pretty tasty. I asked for a side of their cheese sauce to dip them in which made them even better! Next time ill try a burger as it appeared they had a nice selection."}
{"text":"Was passing through and saw this little gem. I waivered between the N Awlins or the Wild Wild West. I went with N Awlins and wasn't disappointed. I also got the fries which are sweet potato and Russet mix with the cayenne seasoning. Burger was done just right and was very juicy. You will need a napkin, maybe 5. Next time I'm in the area, I will try the Wild Wild West."}
{"text":"Great establishment with kick-ass burgers.  Service is always awesome and when Bubba is around he always greets with a smile!!!!"}
{"text":"You know I love me some burgers and this has almost made the top of my list (Steer and Wheel will forever probably definitely hold that distinction).  I love that Bubba's uses fresh ingredients (they don't even have a freezer) and they take pride in what they're serving to you.

Last time I was here, I got the Fresh Burgher.  It's mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic glaze sauce.  It was almost perfect; a little more basil and it would indeed be fresh.  I've also tried their daily special, a Pittsburgher with (duh) coleslaw on it.  The burgers come with a side of mixed fries, so naturally, you have to put them on the burger.

My only \"complaint\" is that the fries have to be eaten while they're hot.  When they cool down, they're almost popcorn-like: crunchy exterior with an airy potato left on the inside, kinda like that hull-less popcorn, you know what I'm sayin'?  It really isn't a valid complaint - you have to eat your fries when they're hot...oh the horror!

The servers are friendly, the beer selection while small is a nice collection of craft beers, and they have $3 Wine and $.50 Wings on Wednesdays starting at 4pm - so naturally I have to go on a Wednesday ASAP."}
{"text":"I made it to Bubba's for the first time this past Friday for lunch. I took my mom out for lunch and she was hungry for a burger so we decided to give Bubba's a try. The menu isn't huge which I feel is a plus! We were a little ahead of the lunch rush and the service was quick and very friendly. We couldn't decide between the classic burger (you just can't beat a good old fashioned burger in my book) and the Bubba burger which was smothered with fried cheddar and delicious  bacon. We decided to order both and split them. The fries are fresh cut and fried to a beautiful golden brown and both burgers were cooked exactly to order and were super juicy.  The classic was an absolute home run as far as burgers go, the bun was good but compared to the rest of the burger was sort of ordinary. The Bubba burger was not just smothered in fried cheddar it was surrounded, the cheese stuck out 2-2-1/2\" all the way around and was just awesome to eat. The meal was so good that for our Sunday date night I took my wife back to Bubba's, this time we were there for dinner. There was no wait as were probably a little late for the dinner rush, we walked right in and were able to grab a table. The server was new, she was friendly and when she didn't know something she made sure to go find out. We ordered the KCCO burger and the Hangover burger (I swapped the french toast for a regular bun) The hangover burger comes with a fried egg and bacon, covered in cheese. This burger was even juicier than the burgers from Friday the downside was the fries were just warm, with fresh cut fries all they need to be is hot and fresh. My wife's burger was excellent as well, her only complaints were that the mushrooms were flavorless and the pulled pork was lackluster. 5 stars is reserved for knockout meals that are perfect. Bubba's came close but didn't quite make it. Overall this place is awesome, the only place I've had a better burger was in Vegas at The Burger Bar."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to come to happy hour with your co-workers if you work in the Southpointe area. The atmosphere is also unique since you can watch the skaters on the ice rink below. We have come here with large groups plenty of times and they are always accommodating. Also, in the summer you can play volleyball and horseshoe which is a plus. I do have one complaint though and that is that they place a hold on your card when you run a tab. They place a 50 dollar hold on your card on top of your final bill that does not come off for a few days. It is very inconvenient and alarming for someone who isn't aware so just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Service is just poor.  One good server, one bad.  Burgers are it, as in the name.  The food is good.  The quality of meat is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday night.  Surprised to be able to get a table right away.  Our waitress was great.  Answered questions, first drinks came fast, refills when needed, waited for us to make our decisions on the burgher we would order.  Really enjoy the burghers, a nice combo of meat.  My classic burger was cooked perfectly and the grilled cheddar cheese pancake really added some great flavor.  Just the right place when you want a big juicy burgher."}
{"text":"BRGR and Burgatory have nothing on Bubba's.  The burgers are the best I've ever had and the wait staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Very slow service. An above average burger. Fries were fresh but missing something.
With a little work, could easily move up to being a 4 star place."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin.  I'm not even sure this visit is worthy of 2 stars.  It was just a disaster from beginning to end.

I walk in to someone at the bar yelling - sit wherever you want.  I stated I had a party of 5 - they told me to go ahead and move tables.  What if I would have gotten hurt?  Anyways - I moved the tables as the waitress stood tapping her foot with our menus waiting for me to finish.

The rest of the party arrives - we get a long introduction by one waitress telling us another girl is training and will be waiting on us.  The girl in training comes over - and we ask for a couple minutes before we place our order

A couple minutes turn into 20 minutes.  20 minutes of us sitting with our menus closed - waiting.  The 3 waitresses on duty were too busy drinking their monster drinks, gossiping at the bar to wait on us.  The tables around us - who came in after us (after the entire group was there) - had their food before we could even place an order.  If they were actually working instead of gossiping - it may have gone smoother.

I wish i could say it got better once our food came.  But it continued to go down hill.  Between the 4 times they had to check our coupon from Yelp for checking in...to the multiple times we were told our drinks would be refilled and never were.  

It took almost 2 hours from the time the whole party arrived to the time we left for a meal that should have taken an hour - at most.  They weren't busy - so that is definitely not an excuse.  

The restaurant has promise - but has SO many things they need to improve before that can happen.  By the looks of other reviews - this isn't the first complaint about the staff.  

Will I be back?  Not a chance."}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we walk in which was nice and welcoming! 
We sat at the bar this Tuesday early evening and Hannah took care of us. She was very polite and made ordering very easy. Her and the server who were working were keeping busy cleaning and making sure everything was neat and clean. They both were sociable and had nice, appropriate conversation with us and the other two guests at the bar. 
We had buffalo chicken dip as an app, was very tasty! But the pita chips seemed over cooked and/or too greasy. But the dip itself was one of the best around! No gross canned chicken!!!
I had the buffalo chicken salad in a wrap and even had it blackened, YUM! It was so perfect I was so full but I just had to finish it. The quality of the chicken really shined through and made it even better -- I couldn't have left any happier! 
My fiancé had Wild, Wild West burger with fries. The fries  were fried perfectly. He was not overly crazy about the burger, he said the bottom bun was soggy from the grease and BBQ sauce. 
Overall, I enjoyed it all and would recommend and/or go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Once again the disappointment and lack of respect and consideration of customers time becomes a major issue.
I have not been to this establishment in 3 years.  The first time we went food and service outstanding.  The owner Bubba was there.  The next two times it was awful.  Like the last time, only 3 years later, service an attitude of server was awful.  She was too busy to greet me.  I sat at bar unwanted on for 5 minutes.  She looked up at me and said I will be with you in a minute as she was adding up some old checks.  Finally came over and took my order and got me a beer.  A half hour later I asked where my food was and she said it's coming soon.  I told her to forget it and I will pay for my beer.   She overcharged me for my beer and I complained about wasting over a half hour of my life as I retrieved my change.  I told her she should be ashamed of herself for letting a customer sit so long unattended and that I will never be back.  Her answer?  Told me to go F myself!  I never  cussed at her just told her how I felt in clean words.   Funny, the other waitress told me as I was leaving she didn't blame me.  Never again!   Never ever!"}
{"text":"Four of went for beers and burgers and all walked away wanting to return another day.

The service was great and took our strange order with humor and it came out right = rare fries.

All 4 burgers were cooked to the temp ordered and the beers were cold.

Good stuff.  Fried pickles were good, too.

There's not many tables here so be patient and have a beer at the bar until a table is ready."}
{"text":"Yummmmy!   Americana at its best.  
SUPER busy, I wasn't impressed with the waitstaff. That can always be a bad moment or day... Five stars it is!"}
{"text":"I eat here once week. The food is good and the staff is super friendly. It's just burgers and bar food, but it is good.  That place is not super big so they can get crowded.  The staff does a good job of keeping things moving so the wait is not too bad.  Its also nice to support a local business."}
{"text":"Five of us went to eat, and all five of us left completely satisfied and stuffed. We each tried a different burger and each was cooked to our desired temps, and made with fresh ingredients. I highly recommend the A-Z burger. 

Our server was excellent. She patiently answered all of our questions and had excellent beer recommendations. 

The place was crowded but our food came out in a reasonable time. Everything was clean. 

Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I have to say, I will NEVER come back to this restaurant. 

After being sat we waited 20m for a waitress to even come to our table. And when I asked another waitress who was serving our table I received a response of, \"Megan\" shouted at me as she walked away. 

Then, when the waitress finally did come by she told ya if we were there to eat it would take 40m and we should probably go elsewhere. 

I just moved to the area and I'm so disappointed in this place. I will never be giving them my business."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this place because she has heard about it on the radio. 
The fries are very good. The place itself is smaller than it looks from the outside, so I would bet it gets packed fairly quickly. 
We ordered two \"gourmet\" burgers, kids boneless wings, kids cheeseburger and kids hotdog. All three burgers were over cooked (well well done)after being ordered medium, minus the kids burger which was ordered at medium well. The hotdog was scorched, which we did return and get taken off the bill. 
I think the grill was just too hot or the beef was 90/10 instead of 80/20. The service was ok, pretty average. 
This place has potential to be very good because the bacon ranch sauce on my burger was awesome. The cook might need a refresher on cook temps and doneness. Max and Ermas and Burgatory are a consistent choice, maybe we'll try bubbas again. sometime."}
{"text":"Ordered the PBC burger. Asked for it to be medium rare and my burger was cooked perfectly. Wasn't that thrilled with the beer cheese. Wish that they would toast the buns so it wouldn't fall apart as I ate my burger. They do use fresh potatoes when they make their fries. If your looking for crispy fries this isn't the place to get them. They come out soft. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I usually listen to 100.7 in the mornings, so I've been hearing about Bubba's Burghers and wanted to give it a try. We also discovered that Wednesdays are $3 wine night, so we were looking forward to it.

We chose a table in the corner near the restrooms, and right off the bat, my friend says, \"I smell urine.\" We hesitated, but I didn't smell anything and she said it had passed, so we decided to stay.

I'd heard that the place was more bar than restaurant, so I didn't really know what to expect. I thought it was a pretty good combination of the two. The bar and dining area are in the same room, but it isn't dark and smoky like a bar. I was a little nervous about the noise level, because a lot of reviews said that it was really noisy. There's nothing I hate more than having to shout in order to have a conversation. But this wasn't my experience at all. Even after the tables started filling up, the noise level remained low to average.

We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip and loved it. The dip is super buffalo-y and my mouth was just a tad on fire. The pitas that came with it were fried and delicious.

I had the Bacon Ranch Burger with the mixture of regular and sweet potato fries. I rather enjoyed the burger. I agreed with my friend that it was a little too well done on the outside, but I still thought it was really good. I suppose the buns are kind of lacking, but my burger didn't fall apart or anything, so I thought it was fine. And if I'm honest, I love any kind of bread. The ranch on the burger was no Denny's ranch, but was still pretty good. The regular fries were delicious, fresh cut, and similar to the Patato Patch's fries. The sweet potato fries tasted ok but weren't crispy, which is a deal breaker for me. 

Friend had a plain burger, and even with ketchup, the outsided was charred too much for her liking. She only had a couple of bites, but did enjoy the fries (only regular fries for her). We had 2 or 3 glasses of wine and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

I ordered the hummus and pita to go to drop off for my mom. These pitas weren't fried but were good (again, any kind of bread). My mom said the hummus was delicious. I had a small taste, but I'm not a fan of hummus, so I can't really say whether it was good or not (I didn't vomit, if that helps).

Our server was attentive, although not super friendly. I guess that's ok since our orders were more or less correct and we didn't have to wait very long. Drinks were refilled within a reasonable time frame.

I'm going to say 4 stars overall, depsite the urine smell (hopefully the restroom just needed a good cleaning). I'd be interested in going back if I'm in the area again.

P.S. Bubba didn't seem to be there. I'm guessing it was too late in the day to catch a glimpse of Bubba. He didn't seem to be around"}
{"text":"The first thing I need to say is that this was the best service we've received in a long while! The server struck just the right balance between informative and personal, not overbearing or cocky. 

The menu contains several burger concoctions that are everything from a classic patty, cheese, and lettuce to the Fun Guy with portabellas. They're not crazy, but they're good!

We split was was closest to the BBQ bacon cheeseburger from Benjamin's so that we could compare. Unfortunately, there was really no comparison. Bubba's is good quality meat, but with very little seasoning. I'm also realizing as of late that putting fried onions on a burger, while tasty, is just a way to add more salt and mask the true flavors of the sandwich. I did like the combination of fried onions with fresh onions, though. The sauce was where the line was drawn between the two burgers. Bubba's is a simple sauce, tasting a good bit like Sweet Baby Rays. Lastly, although the burger was cooked to preference, the bun didn't hold up against the juices. Had to go to fork halfway through. 

So, my simple palette was very pleased, but this burger took second place (really, third place because Fat Heads remains #1). 

The French fry mix of Idaho and sweet potato was yummy, but the texture of the fries was more chewy than crispy. Not a bad thing, if you're into that. They use (I think) the salt/sugar seasoning that more places are getting into.

They have an eclectic bottle selection, and I would encourage them to increase their draft selection to more than two taps. 

The happy hour specials look really fun, especially Wednesday ladies night!

We may return, but only for a special."}
