{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican place.  Very good food and good service!"}
{"text":"Good value and consistent, tasty, well-prepared dishes. Service is variable--servers are very friendly but can sometimes  be hard to find. Attractive environment, much larger than you'd think from the outside, with side rooms that would work well for groups. Recommended."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy.  I'm there probably once a week either w/ co-workers for lunch or with my wife on the weekends.  Salsa is great, but try adding some Tapatio hot sauce to it to make it better.  Lunch #5 is the staple, but the carnitas dinner is great as well, albeit a little hit or miss.  Service is speedy and accomodating."}
{"text":"It's a 3.5.  I have been here twice now, and it is A-ok.  The extra .5 star is for the carnitas.  I am a sucker for good carnitas.  They were a little tougher than the best I've had, but plenty moisture and tasty.  Chips and salsa also served.  At the table one of the condiments is chipotle sauce.  I don't find that to be a table condiment too often.   Usually have to ask for it.  The tortillas, beans, and rice are on par.
The decor is typical and surprisingly large on the inside for being tucked into the corner of a strip mall.  

Pros: nice fast service, decent price, large beers

Cons: The salsa is watered down a bit; the chips are warm but almost stale.

This place is good for hour lunchers."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what happened to this place.  It used to be AMAZING, but the service has gone so down hill lately.  It took us over an hour to get our food the other night, and there were only four other tables in the place with people eating.  The food is delicious, and the portions are fantastic, but the service really needs some work!"}
{"text":"I live in California now, so I've got all sorts of options for Mexican food.  But when I'm back home I always end up at Mariachi's.  The food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is always engaging and personable.  They have a large room that works really well for parties, too."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican cuisine with lots of options for kids.  Always have gotten take out so can't speak to the dining in experience.  I look forward to eating here at least once a week.  You really can't go wrong with most dishes on the menu, but the steak with chorizo dish is off the hook."}
