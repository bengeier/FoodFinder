{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here once a week, and always order the same thing, the bento box dinner special. It comes with a soup, salad, dumplings, rice, salmon teriyaki, shrimp and veggie tempura and one sushi roll! so much food and all delicious. Salmon is always cooked perfectly, and the tempura is the best I have had! Super crispy and tender inside! I will continue to come back weekly!"}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced. The jalapeno popper appetizer is the best I've ever had.
Its got slot of choices for rolls but  many of them are tempura.
The ambiance is mellow and the service was good. Its worth checking out."}
{"text":"We were seated and served very quickly. Service was great, and the food was great too. My only complaint was the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy at all. The salmon nigiri was great and so was our other shrimp tempura roll."}
{"text":"We went for lunch Sunday. The fish they used was really good. They had a wide variety of rolls and the portions for each roll were large. Great place for good inexpensive sushi!"}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant! The staff is very friendly and never far away if you need anything. I haven't eaten anything here that I didn't love. Nice, relaxed atmosphere with quiet music in the background. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cozy, quiet, comfortable and consistent sushi restaurant, Midori is the place. My boyfriend and I visit regularly, up to once a week for a year now. Once the employees see us coming, they already have our drinks ready and let us sit at our normal table and remain attentive. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. At times the chef will recommend stuff that's not on the menu to my boyfriend and he hasn't been disappointed yet. This is the sushi experience we were looking for since moving to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has some great online coupons and their happy hour sushi prices are awesome. Creative rolls, good service. I've now been twice (once for lunch, once for dinner) and it was good both times. I've had some bad sushi experiences in las vegas, but this place I will come back to."}
{"text":"Visited Midori for dinner.  Fish was excellent! Salmon was melt in your mouth fresh.  They have a very interesting selection of rolls that sets them apart from other sushi restaurants.  There were rolls for sushi lovers, tempura lovers, and baked lovers.  They don't seem to want  to get creative or off menu though.  Staff was extremely friendly.  The place was small but very clean with a nice decor.  There were couples and a family dining as well.  I was a little surprised by the price; it was a bit more than we expected.  We will be back !"}
{"text":"After having to \"forgive\" our usual sushi joint one too many times, I took to Yelp to find an alternative and found great reviews for Midori. My first experience was with my mom and it was sooooo good that we came back with my fiancé about a week later!

My mom - the spicy tuna with crispy rice and then kind of created her own roll (she can be picky and our server didn't bat an eye to accommodate her). 
Fiancé - the ugly roll and the Japanese lasagna. He was pretty much silent once the food came save the moans of sweet satisfaction. 
Me - the jalapeño popper roll (this guy is HUGE and delicious!) and tiger roll

There wasn't even a piece of pickled ginger left on the plates when we were done! The service is spot-on (never had an empty water glass or empty sake bottle), the food is wonderful, and the prices are very reasonable. We'll be back again...probably next week!"}
{"text":"10 stars if i could! The BEST in Las Vegas/Henderson by far!

My husband and i love Midori. The fish is so fresh and all of their food is flavorful. You can taste the quality and see why Midori ranks top for sushi once your plates hit the table. 

We lived 10 mins from Midori for 4 yrs and looked forward to our date nights which we religiously went Midori every Thursday night. Sometimes we'd go twice a week. 

We have recently moved to NLV and are unable to go as often but still drive 40 mins just to have Midori when we crave sushi. Its worth it!

Try the Salmon & Lemon roll - our #1 fav! 

Everytime we go, the service is excellent. They know what we want to drink and bring it to our table without asking and they know our order and ask if we'd like 'the usual' :)

Midori, we miss you!"}
{"text":"Midori is a gem of a Japanese restaurant, with high quality food and even higher quality service. Best of all,  it's quiet and relaxing, which makes the experience all that more pleasant.  You can order by picture, because the bento boxes look exactly as pictured....The chicken was soft and the Kobe beef bent was tender and luscious. I really enjoy tempura when it it's cooked in clean, hit oil. At Midori, you only taste the food, not the fryer.  I would like to keep this place a secret, but everyone has to know how great Midori is...I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place deserves more reviews. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and to my surprise food and service were great. Good Happy Hour! I love spicy food and very much enjoyed the pink panther roll and the jalapeño popper roll. Good Eats!"}
{"text":"The food was great but we had four baby cockroaches run across our table. We told the server and asked to be moved. He said we could move to the table next to us. I ask to be moved to another location which he allowed.  He never apologized.  We left our regular tip and a suggestion to call their bug man.  These things happen. I understand but an apology would of been nice. I didn't start screaming. There were other patrons. I think I handled it well. I think i was beyond polite. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Yeeesss yes and yum. Beautiful presentation and taste. Very calm atmosphere inside and clean looking. Server was kind and professional(even though i got food to go) lol food was great try this if you're looking for good sushi/sashimi in henderson."}
{"text":"When I moved to town last July, I was lamenting having to lose my favorite sushi spot. Having been overseas to Japan, I knew what I wanted. While looking for housing one afternoon, I stopped in Midori to \"see how this place measures up.\" Needless to say, they instantly became my new home for sushi. All the folks are great, the food is great. Matter of fact, I have made myself hungry just sitting here typing about it.....you know what that means.....it's going to be SUSHI NIGHT!!!!!

C'mon, isn't it being Wednesday reason enough for you to go get sushi?????"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many years.  I take my parents here, or some times my relatives.     Before it has a different name, Wonder Sushi, I think.  Then they renovated it, and changed the name.  But the same people. Food is great and people/staff are friendly.   Clean and spacious. Plenty of parking.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Conveniently located next door to my work. I come here during my lunch break from time to time. Service is quick and efficient. Sushi is good. Lots of lunch specials to choose from. Nice calm ambience inside."}
{"text":"Great little spot! We have been coming here for a couple of years now. I can say that we have never been disappointed with a single visit. Everything on the menu has been very consistent. The grilled mackerel box is awesome and the grilled salmon box is always cooked perfectly! We also enjoy the sushi and rolls. Service is prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Very good rolls... Great service!!!! Have yet to be disappointed!!! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Just found this jewel. This is a great place to eat. The service is great, friendly staff. Food is really good, and I've been eating Japanese food in Hawaii all my life. My husband and I had the sushi dinner and sukiyaki. Everything was perfect. Very affordable. A nice neighborhood place with ambience, great food and wonderful service. And finally a place that got the music right, soft background dinner music playing from a good sound system. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"My co-workers love this place.  I'm a little more \"mehhh\" about it.

Disclaimer:  the only thing I've ever ordered here is the Sashimi Silver lunch special ($13.95).  It comes with several slices of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon sashimi.  You also get a little salad, soup and rice.

It's OKAY.  But, a little smelly.  And not a \"wow, super fresh\" smell.  Kinda disappointing.

My co-workers always get the bento box lunch specials.  At $9.95, you can get better sushi lunch specials elsewhere.  
  
Positives include attractive decor, convenient parking, and friendly service.  Overall, okay for a work lunch, at most."}
{"text":"I usually partake in an all you can eat sushi places, but this one deserves to be praised.  The mussel appetizers were delicious, as well as the cucumber salad, and the sushi roll. I was full and satisfied.  Everything was really good."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have ever had hands down! Everything is fresh & made with love. I can't say enough great things about this place.Everything from the appetizers to the desserts to the ice tea is amazing. The calamari is to die for. It is served with the sweet vinegar that gives it just the right pop!  
I try to eat here at least once a week ,I am dying to try everything on the menu!  And whether it's a party of two or a party of six I have had nothing but top notch service!"}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi lover but this place was definitely not one of my favorites. Customer service was great, I'll give them that. But the sushi rolls were not appetizing what so ever. I prefer the ones you can get at a local grocery store than to come back."}
{"text":"I'm half Japanese so I admit I'm a bit of a Japanese food snob.  Love this place!  We've been going to Midori for years, great food, greater service.  At one time we had a bit of a hiatus for several months, and when we went back I had forgotten to tell the waiter that I didn't want sesame seeds on the outside of the sushi roll, or sprinkled on anything else.  He remembered without me even mentioning it!  After I ordered, he said \"no sesame, right?\"   Just Wow.  Kudos for his memory retention.
The tempura is perfection.  And thank you for serving it with actual tempura dipping sauce with grated daikon in it; not watered down teriyaki sauce that so many other \"Japanese\" restaurants seem to be serving up these days.  
Prices are excellent for the portions they serve up.  Did I mention the cucumber salad?  Give it a try."}
{"text":"My doctor told me about this restaurant because I wanted Sushi but my new eating plan is no carb.  They have 8-10 rolls that are low carb, so it was a place I could go with friends and didn't have to worry.  Today we went for lunch and we tried 4 of the low carb rolls.  They were fabulous!!  It was so great to be able to enjoy sushi and not have to worry about anything.  The staff was so friendly and we will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this sushi joint! the fish is always fresh and the staff is always so nice.I recently moved away from Henderson, but I do not mind making the 30 minute trip from Summerlin to eat here. I would definitely recommend the Tiger Roll, it is the best one in town!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We had the bento box, it was pretty basic. A friend had the sushi platter, looked okay. Fish was fresh but nothing to write home about. Menu was uninspiring, mostly fusion style rolls. I can take it or leave it. Service was great though."}
{"text":"For a quick, simple lunch spot I'd say this place was not bad. I took my mom here because it was super close to my place and she was craving some yummy sushi. As always, My fellow Yelpers helped us out and led us here for lunch. 

+ Service was excellent. If we asked a question they didn't know, they made sure to find out instead of saying, \"I don't know\" like I've experienced at other places in the past.
+ They offered brown rice, which is always a plus for me
+ Lunch prices are super affordable 
+ Food came out super quick but we were the only ones in the restaurant lol

- They didn't have sake bombs? (yes, my mom wanted one at 1 in the afternoon )
- They were out of another type of fish my mom requested, sorry I can't remember the name (will update when I figure it out)

Overall, it's a cute little place to grab a bite to eat; however, I don't think I'd specifically pick this place to go to for a nice dinner. My first choices would be either I Love Sushi or Spicy Tuna in Henderson. 

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Omg!! I have been to a good amount of sushi places and their quality is getting worse and worse. This place has the best quality I have had hands down! They say the locals don't really like it here, but I am a local and say I would drive from the other side of town every week to eat here. Good portions great authenticity of their food, and great knowledge from the chef. Come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Quality of fish is excellent. Nice ambiance. The only thing that would've made the experience better is traditional Japanese rather than easy listening piano. Service is spot on."}
{"text":"I felt bad for this place - my husband and I went on a Tuesday and we were one of three tables in the place. Must be the location? Hopefully it's busier for them on the weekends. No complaints, the sushi was good and fast. Not much waitress interaction.

I don't remember leaving thinking, \"That was incredible!\" but I have no complaints. Could be a nice best-kept-secret place for you and your friends."}
{"text":"A dozen of us went there last night to celebrate a friends birthday. When we asked for seperate checks the \"server\" rolled her eyes, got an attitude and told us we could do it but it would take longer to get our food. 
I've been in the food and beverage industry most of my life and have nor would NEVER tell a guest this. She is there to do a job and that's to serve those who dine in that establishment. 
We all grouped up to make it easier for her...ugh. And we tipped her, reluctantly. 
I will go back there because the food was delicious but I WILL NOT have her as a server. We
 didn't get her name because her attitude made us all pretty angry. But we still had a great time as we always do....no matter what the obstacle."}
{"text":"The smooth jazz/top 40 mix at a sushi place is weird, rolls were so so but you have to get the \"roll in the sand\" roll.

Pricing very high/unfriendly service"}
{"text":"Always quick & quality sushi for my girlfriend's lunch hour at the sushi bar.  We love the handrolls, baked green mussels & Butter Roll.  The chefs have a good sense of humor, the servers are always helpful, & the Pinot Grigio & Sake are better than the Chardonnay.  Also the menu has a nice variety of salads, low carb rolls, sashimi plates, handrolls & rolls!  The Alaskan, Mexican, Spicy Tuna & the Philadelphia hand rolls, are my favorite.  You pick three for $11 & it's full of thick pieces of fish.  

The Butter is my favorite Roll so I highly recommend it.  I could never do an AYCE here cause of how large the rolls are, cause of that I am not even sure if they offer it.  We split one Butter Roll & I was already full!  Flower got the three handrolls, ate two of the three & I helped her w/ one... Super good every time I come."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here it was really slow service.  Sushi quality varies wildly. Not worth the time investment"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. An awesome spot for a relaxed meal in an elegant looking restaurant. They have the best spicy garlic edamame you will have in your life. Their fish is so fresh and delicious. This is not AYCE, but still totally worth it. I usually get the Death of Dragon roll which is spicy crab, eel, avocado, deep fried in tempura, and topped with a spicy mayo and eel sauce. Also, the tempura ice cream is to die for. Tempura on the outside with a chocolate outer filling between the tempura and ice cream."}
{"text":"This a fantastic restaurant. We eat sushi everywhere and Midori seems to have a touch more sophistication than other good sushi restaurants. The food is wonderful and the service is attentive, but not overbearing. The atmosphere is pleasant and is the type of place that you will want to linger over your tea. Highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tuna Poki! Hawaiian Roll drenched with the best Ponzu ever! 10/10 Agadashi Tofu! The batter is amazing."}
{"text":"Forget about those loud, crowded Japanese sushi restaurants that boast of their sushi and/or famous chefs.  This has to be one of the finer, true Japanese restaurants in the area.  It's what a true Japanese restaurant should be:  calm, soothing, good service and excellent food.  And, for the price it's like a hidden gem.  I've become addicted to their \"Agedashi Tofu\" appetizer (fried tofu in a nice sauce)... and have ordered it with each visit so far."}
{"text":"The prices here are great. It's super cheap for what you get! 

The sushi is sooooooo good. I went here because I saw everyone's reviews about the great sushi-- they're right! 

The restaurant itself is kind of small, but the time I went it wasn't busy, so it was nice for a quick stop for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"I love their miso soup and their sushi. They are generous with the fish and the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Here it is in a nutshell - this place is great. You can skip I Love Sushi and just come here. The fish is so fresh and while the have rolls, they all actually taste different! Not like some of the other sushi restaurants with roll after roll that all taste the same. And the sashimi... WOW! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Usually the word \"fusion\" does not elicit a positive response from me, but I came here for lunch just to try it and not only was the food awesome and well priced (I had the tonkatsu bento box), but the waiter took my order fast, got my food fast, and refilled my water six times.  I will definitely be coming back here.  Excellent service Midori Sushi!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend on Friday night.  The service was beyond extremely slow and the food was mediocre at best. We each ordered 3 rolls and it took 3 1/2 hours for us to get all of our food and half of it was made incorrectly.  There were only 5 tables occupied the entire night.  Save yourself the headache and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered take out my first time here.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I've eaten here three times now and I always get great service and great food.  The lunch and dinner specials are filling and economical.  The only thing I didn't care for was their water.  It wasn't that great do I ordered an iced tea."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is a bit tucked in, so you could easily miss it. We tried it for dinner and overall, I enjoyed it here.

We're not big on AYCE sushi. This place has a variety of rolls, sashimi, and decent selections for my 4 year old son. We've come here a couple of times, each time there weren't many customers, maybe one table or a couple patrons up at the sushi bar. 

The service was just OK. They didn't try to attempt to be very attentive and more focused on cleaning. Price was very decent and reasonable.

The food was great quality. My boyfriend ordered a small dish which included some Kobe beef, which was phenomenal. I think I ate more of his food than I was welcomed to. LOL

I'd probably be back. Maybe to get take-out."}
{"text":"Serene ambiance found at Midori. 

I joined a few friends here for lunch.  The dining area is large and clean with seating around a sushi counter.  The decor combined with their music is very calming. Service here is great.  They are very polite and so attentive.  Our drinks were refilled often with quick preparation of our meals.  

Since it was lunchtime, they offer 9 great bento box specials.  They are all served with miso soup, salad and steamed rice.  The box specials also include your choice of sushi roll.  I had the shrimp tempura (bento D).  This comes with chicken gyoza and my sushi election of shrimp tempura roll.  Delicious! The tempura was light and airy but didn't take anything away from the shrimp.  

With a fantastic lunch deal, wonderful food and service, I would recommend stopping in to see why I enjoyed it so much."}
{"text":"I decided to come to Midori because it's really close to my house and it definitely lives up the all the good reviews. Be careful though - usually when I go to a sushi place I know typically about how many rolls and how much nigiri I can handle so I order it all at once, but Midori has big portions for a sushi place! This isn't a complaint, just a heads up."}
{"text":"My go-to place for both traditional sushi/sashimi as well as fusion-style. Flavor and prep is excellent and there rolls are made with just the right amount of rice. Occasionally we visit other sushi restaraunts and izakaya's but are always disappointed. They also feature a nice selection of non-sushi menu items like teriyaki, udon, salads and more."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling, my wife took me here for dinner. The service was amazing and the food was Ok. The mixed veggie roll was amazing and was my favorite. The veggie tempura was just OK and didn't have much flavor. The green bean tempura was my favorite. They also made garlic edamame for us, which was quite spicy! I loved it, it was too hot for my wife. 

My wife had teriyaki salmon with rice and the veggie tempura. She loved the fish, but said the teriyaki sauce didn't taste that great. 

We also had the green apple saki, this was very sweet! We shared one glass as it was that sweet. It's a perfect way to end a meal! It really reminded me of sour apple martini. If I am in the area I would stop here again for a veggie roll. It's a nice change from my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"I hate to break the news but this is what happened. We decided to have sushi last night and because I had been to Midori a handful of times and it is conveniently located to my residence decided to go there with 2 other people. We were going to get it as take out, but once in, decided to sit at a table and eat there. We had only been there about 5 minutes and going over the menu. As soon as we decided on our order, my friend across the other side of the table noticed something crawling on his wifes arm across from him. Didn't really know what it was and she just hit it off of her arm. Then another min later it was on her again and she again brushed it off of her arm. I personally would have jumped and possibly shrilled. Then there it was on the table... A SMALL COCKROACH!!!!! I then immediately tried to cup it to show the waiter. Whoa what a gross experience!! We made sure the waiter saw it and told him that this was unacceptable and then proceeded to leave. We then went to another restaurant. The whole time she was itching and scratching her arms from the trauma. She then told me the next day that after we arrived home that she took a bath to erase the experience and it didn't help. She itched and scratched the whole night. This is sad to have to report but if a roach had actually made it to the top of a table, then we all agreed to what must be lurking in the back room with all of the food. The restaurant has been reported to the health dept. and hopefully there will be a follow up!!"}
{"text":"We had been regulars but my wife and son went and the waitress brought my son who is 9, green tea instead of red bean ice cream.My wife said he cant have green tea because of the caffeine so instead of just getting a red bean she hassled my son that that's not what he said and we have to charge you.My son doesn't like green tea and would not have ordered it. My wife told them that she would not be coming back, too bad,good food but to lose customer over ice cream that's poor service!"}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years! So excellent. They have changed the menu in recent years and it is still great. Such a nice little place. Clean, great service, and sushi is fresh. I love their sashimi and they have a great selection of rolls. Oh and great green tea! So good I stop sometimes just to grab it after yoga nearby. Perfectly fair price too. It's not one of those all you can eat places that just tries to get you in and out. They take care of you. I do not suggest going in super late- I highly doubt they, or any restaurant for that matter, wants to take you close to close. But lunch and dinner there are both great! Think the hawaiian rolls is one of my favorites.... Consistently great!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was good both times.  We returned because my partner loves the spicy tuna bowel.  During our trips we had multiple rolls, sea weed salad, miso soup, sashimi, fried ice cream and of course the incredible spicy tuna bowel.  

On our second trip in we were informed by the sushi chef that you can NOT order the spicy tuna bowel for dinner.  It must be ordered prior to 3pm.  He came off as rude but this could just be misunderstood communication.  

The customer is NOT always right but be gentle in letting them down. 

This place does have good food and maybe we just caught the chef on a bad day.  We might return, but we are going to try out a few different places prior to giving this restaurant a third try."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed many sushi places in Henderson and Las Vegas over the years, but every place pales in comparison to Midori. The quality and selection is excellent. We highly recommend the Deja Vu and the jalapeño sashimi. The Midori Oises is wonderful, too!"}
{"text":"We take our friends and out of town guests there atleast once a month. The portions are huge and out of this world.  The servers are all very nice, and we have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Update: I thought I had seen on the news this restaurant was closed due to health code violations because of cockroaches and cockroach feces. When I looked up on the health department website, they were open with an A grade. 

I was confused. I did see that news video... Did they make a mistake? No. They didn't.

I hit \"previous inspections\" and sure enough they were closed down by the health department, but they asked that a reinspection be done after they cleaned up all the cockroaches. So now they have an A grade. Sadly everyone at the office agreed that we won't be back. 

Previously written months prior: This is our go-to lunch place at work. The bento boxes are just perfect. You get a sushi roll, salad, dumplings, miso soup and a main course like shrimp tempura for about $10. Total deal and it's always fresh. The staff are always courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Its a DAMN shame on a saturday night, and this place is flat out empty.  On the other hand, with a group of 12, and half of the group are kids... it was the best dining experience i had in awhile.

Food is SOLID.  Fresh fish and sushi...entrees are very generous... Service was very good....

Really hope they make it...cuz we are going back next year if still around...."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place last year. It's close to the house and has decent sushi. We are a little spoiled because we came from So Cal and had awesome sushi there. We have no complaints about the food but it is slightly overpriced. When we have dined in, we have had decent service and love the atmosphere. We are / on dine in or take out. Of course, when we want sake, it is dine in and they have a lovely selection of nigiri and flavored sake by the bottle or glass. The staff is always on point and polite with suggestions if we ask. I do recommend trying here. It is one of the better sushi places off the Strip."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my co workers. I ordered the specialty sashimi and the the baked sushi roll.

The sashimi were just okay, nothing to be excited about. However, the baked sushi was amazing ! It was really heavy but flavourful. It was legit an explosion in my mouth, which might be a bit too much for people. I'd really like to go again and try more of their baked sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi and sushi rolls weren't bad. Pretty good flavor. Not overloaded with rice. Lots of fish. 

Service was terrible. They also staffed one sushi chef for the entire restaurant on Sunday. Let's just say it took them 2.5 hours to serve us three rolls, and we ordered eight. We ended up canceling the rest. 

Place could have been a decent spot. Won't be back"}
{"text":"We come to this place at least three times a month. 
The food is awesome and the prices decent. 
The service is very personal, we even have our own table.
They don't only serve traditional sushi like nigiri and sashimi, they have fusion dishes and even low carb options without rice. The menu is extensive, so it would take you a while to try everything they offer. 
It's our favorite sushi restaurant in Henderson for a reason!"}
{"text":"We tried the vanilla tempura ice cream it was really good.
We also really liked the dejavu roll and the ugly roll."}
{"text":"Midori really is as good as it gets.  You'll find no better source of fresh and beautifully prepared sushi...all at a great value.  Every time I try another sushi restaurant I end up thinking that I wish I'd gone to Midori.  Truly great service too.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Midori is my favorite sushi place by far! Everything is so fresh and delicious. And... it is just around the corner!"}
{"text":"Just came home from Midori- OMG!!!!! AWESOME!!! quiet, relaxed, no owner handing out the check and rushing me out the door. The lo carb menu, and sashimi was magnificent. The waitress was wonderful. Kept our drinks full continuously, very friendly. Loved this place and now need to spread the word so if you are into a class act place this is it!"}
{"text":"Another WOW evening at our favorite Sushi/Japanese restaurant in Green Valley. An unassuming shopping center location with fresh, tasty treats. Excellent sake selection with the option for reasonably priced flights. From the fried tofu to baked green mussels, yum, yum!!! Everything priced well."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Definitely going back again.  Loved the service and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Over the years I found some great restaurants from Yelp reviews. The reviews for Midori Japanese Fusion Sushi are misleading to say the least. The food was mediocre at best. My fiancée ordered the Poke Salad. The salad was a big stack of micro greens with 4 pieces of seared tuna and pickled cucumber. He asked the server to confirm the order because the dish looked nothing like the photo on their menu-- looked more like Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. The server read the order back and claimed the dish was the Poke Salad. Needless to say, the salad was bland. I ordered one of their Special Sushi Rolls. I cannot remember name because the roll was not memorable-- included spicy tuna and some crunch. Maybe I have become spoiled by the amazing sushi restaurants in the valley, but Midori Japanese Fusion Sushi was a big let down. Our dining experience differed dramatically from the reviews. Plus my fiancée and I got sick that night!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Midori for the first time today with my 3 year old son for lunch. I've tried so many japanese restaurant that I'm 100% positive this is the best one yet. We ordered the lunch special Chicken katsu with spicy crab roll and my son literally ate the whole bowl of rice and chicken and I ate the roll, chicken gyoza and green salad that came with it. It was a perfect size for the 2 of us. If my son can finish a whole meal, it says something about the taste because he usually doesn't eat that much. Our servers were very nice and friendly. And the ambiance is very zen. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years now and we love it! We go every friday night for our date night. I always get the same thing. We go so often that the staff brings over tea and asked if want the usual. The food is great and you can't beat the prices. My only recommendation would to be to eat here when your not in a rush. It's very laid back and they want you to take your time while dinning!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. Always good sushi, and a nice place to eat! Like that it's close to home. Always happy, and full, when I leave here. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to explain the sushi. I love the sushi! I would totally recommend this place if you're trying the sushi. I would recommend \"My Name Is Bond\" and the California Roll. If you have children, do the bentos with the California Roll. I would totally come back. It's very quiet and I like that in restaurants. It takes a while to get your sushi but it's homemade so I would expect that."}
{"text":"While I was out and about on Green Valley PKWY I stumbled upon Midori. Everyone knows I love Sushi and this place was OUTSTANDING! The décor, the atmosphere, the music it was all calming and relaxing. Not hectic and noisy like most places. Service was awesome. My knew Favorite Sushi place. I order a salad and eel and avocado roll.. YUM! If your in the neighborhood and craving sushi,I suggest you stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"My family likes their sushi, and had no complaints. The only standout was the mackerel. My mom said it was the best she's had. I got the Hawaiian rule, which was tasty, but kind of chewy. I also got the the jalapeno poppers appetizer, which I enjoyed, but not as much as the one at Kobo across town. Overall, would go back."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place! My boyfriend and I have become regulars. The service is great and the sushi is amazing!"}
{"text":"For lunch or for dinner, I found my alternative to I love Sushi with a really friendly and nice staff, and not as expensive and loud as I love sushi. 
 I can finally go and  enjoy my sushi without feeling uncomfortable watching the manager yelling at clients and employees.
I really like their Bento Box, it is a really good deal and the portions and quality are amazing for the price. I've tried the bento box for lunch with Tempura veggies and Chicken Breast Katsu. They bring you Miso soup, rice, a small sushi roll, salad and a small appetizer depending on the bento box you choose.
My husband have tried the Pork and Shrimp Bento. So far no complaints. If you get the Bento Box for dinner, the price is not that high and you get a bigger portion. So far we've been happy with Bento Box for Lunch and dinner.
For sushi rolls we've tried the \"One is enough\" roll and Spicy Crab. We also love The Tuna Poke Tower. We haven't tried more rolls or things on the menu because we already know we won't be able to finish it. 
I have to add that \"One is Enough roll\" has become my new favorite roll."}
{"text":"What an awesome lunch! 
My mom took me here to try some fusion sushi. Having been to various places on the strip, i was happy to get away to attempt something new.
The chef and wait staff were absolutely friendly and super attentive.
We had a ton of food (omakase-style) and each dish was just phenomenal. 
The chef even made some house signature dishes as well as some new fusion dishes i have never had. 
Overall, 5 stars!! Will definately visit again when i'm back in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique specialty rolls. Quality of fish is always top grade. Staff is very friendly and efficient. I recommend the Deja Vu roll and some Fuji apple sake."}
{"text":"Soda was flat, rolls were ok, don't order the mussels because they have zero flavor. Salmon sushi I'd give like 4 stars. Miso soup was good because they chopped up the tofu. No veggies are in chicken teriyaki. Screaming orgasm was soupy with spicy, but no real flavor.
Service was ok. I wouldn't ever come back here."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years. Great little hidden gem. Atmosphere is soothing & squeaky-clean. Quiet, comfortable & relaxing. Service is polite & efficient. The most complete & carefully prepared bentos you'll find anywhere, especially at this price point - a real bargain. Sushi as good as any in this price range. If you are looking for a nice, quiet, comfortable place with good food & service at a reasonable price in the heart of Green Valley, this is it."}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi place close to home. Good selection, really good sushi and great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go- I'll give it another shot another time, but it was no good. Tuna is ground, seems to have fillers? It doesn't taste like a tuna roll. Also, left an oil/grease stain in the to go box- how does a spicy tuna sushi roll do that? Overall very disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite 
Quiet , nice location. 

... until my wife found a large piece of plastic in her sushi hand roll 
It was a large piece of semi rigid plastic from their imitation crab packaging. A health hazard and a choking hazard  
AND they admitted this is the second time it happened. 
They were TRYING to fix this problem knowing it happened before ( easy fix, be careful when opening packages .. Check the product ) 

 ( and they still charged me for the entire meal minus the one item ) 

I used to go here often , especially for business lunches. 

Not any  more.  

So, BAD QUALITY CONTROL  

STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"The chicken lunch special is $9 and you get enough food for two people. I had the chicken teriyaki and it came with Miso soup, a salad, white rice, 2 dumplings and a full spicy tuna sushi roll. The sushi was fantastic. The chicken tasted a little old, but it was ok. The salad, rice and dumplings were excellent, but I didn't care for the soup at all. It sort of reminded me of the bacterial growth medium from biology class back in 10th grade. Even if I didn't have the soup, I had SO MUCH FOOD! For the price of a roll alone I got a bunch of extras. I would say overall I'm pleased."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and very attentive and kind. Food was fresh and amazing. Had the grilled yellowtail collar, and nigiri style sushi in salmon, uni and ikura...all fresh, yellowtail was cooked JUST right and flavorful. Atmosphere is calm during the day, had a later lunch here. Place is super clean. All is good, I'll for sure be coming back here:)"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had!

I eat sushi at least once a week, and this has to be some of the freshest and tastiest sushi I've ever eaten. 

Don't go here to be dazzled by amazing service or awesome atmosphere bc you'll only be disappointed. However, if you want some of the tastiest food in town then make sure to to find this (well) hidden gem."}
{"text":"Secret tip: Ask for the off menu rolls - chef will accommodate requests if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Have now eaten here 3 times.  The first two times were Ok but the third was not very good.  The fish was fishy.  Never a good sign when it comes to seafood.

The miso soup is different.  A little too thick for my taste.

Overall the service all three times was fine."}
{"text":"Great spot to sneak away for lunch. Very calm and relaxing atmosphere. And good food!"}
{"text":"meh, this place was okay.... nothing special about it at all . no atmosphere the service is not over welcoming. would think twice before going back.  not bad but nothing to make me want to go back either"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this dinner after all the great reviews, especially since it's closer to my house than my other favorite sushi place over on eastern. The wife and I came here on a Sunday night and there were only 6 other people here for dinner. We ordered a couple of rolls and two bento box dinners. I wasn't impressed at all with the food and sent half of it back including the white rice. Service and the prices were good but we will not return."}
{"text":"My son and I both got an upset stomach from the sushi here. It's either the imitation crab they used on the sushi, or the eel that was on top of it. The only thing we both ate together was that. Unless all their sushi was just bad, period. Only good thing I saw was the size of the nigiri. Good amount of fish and rice ration. Now I don't know if that's a good thing in my case coz we got sick from it. 

Never again..  we'll pass on peeing out of our butt. Not fun. Serves me right on eating sushi at a place I've never eaten at before. Sticking with places we trust."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience, great prizes. One of my favorites now the food is amazing recommended if you like noodles and sushi. The bentos boxed are good amount of food at a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"I will go out on a limb and say that this is probably the only true Japanese style sushi restaurant in town that actually follows the Japanese tradition of sushi preparation.
The decor when you first walk in is very soothing and relaxing. Sure there are a few TVs hung up in case you need to watch a football game or something, but they are just there are a sideline and not the main attraction here. They play some sleepy music, but I must admit that is what should be played in a restaurant like this, it doesn't always have to be loud and jumpy music like many other sushi joints. First off the rolls here are presented in a true artsy fashion that not only taste good, but is pleasing to the eye. 99% of the sushi places in town just cut up the rolls and drizzle some salty   brown sauce all over in some kind of preschool pattern. Here they rolls are colorful, perfectly made and elegantly presented. No chipped plates or junky bento boxes. The bento boxes for lunch and dinner are perfection every time! The bento boxes are easy to order, choose the entree of your choice such as teriyaki beef, chicken, tempura, pork or chicken katsu, salmon....then a sushi roll from a good selection (the spicy tuna is what we usually have). You also get miso soup, salad, 2 chicken goyza and a bowl of the most impressive white rice to ever hit your palate. We've dined here numerous times and they have never ever let us down. Also nearly every plate and bento box comes with a generous portion of fresh wasabi and ginger. The wasabi is very fresh and they provide plenty of it, not like some other places that act like it's gold and isn't all that great anyways.
 Super attentive service, excellent presentation and the prices for a lunch bento box is around $10. Try them out for lunch, weekdays they open at 11:30 and sunday is at 12 I think.
5 stars for food, 5 stars for presentation, 5 stars for service and 5 stars for bento lunch prices. We love it here and I bet you will too! Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"After wanting sushi for a couple months now I finally was able to satisfy my craving for it. We choose Midori because it's right down the road from us. Went around 6PM on a Sunday and we basically had the whole place to ourselves which was nice. Started off with the Miso soup and edamame. I loved that the tofu is chopped up into tiny pieces because my son ate it without noticing. We ordered California roll, Philadelphia roll and Baked Lasagna. All very delicious! Bill came was about $35. Overall we had a great visit with a very sweet waitress! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. You can't really beat the price and the quality of service. I'm always shocked at how quick my server is to pick up a piece of trash, or refill our waters or how fast they run to our tables when we ask for additional sides. My favorite appetizer is the Gyoza. I always ask for extra Gyoza sauce because it's the perfect blend of spices and so far no other sushi place can recreate the quality and taste. Such an amazing place! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was the best sushi we have had in quite awhile. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. They combined some different flavors and sauces. The Hawaiian roll was our favorite!! The Italian was also a must have! And even our kids said the jalapeño poppers were the best they've ever had. Some of the sushi places in town have mediocre service at best, but not midori. They were wonderful!! Also, the ambience is very relaxing. You completely forget that you are in a shopping center."}
{"text":"A successful football coach, Bill Parsells, once said that if a team has a mediocre record, it is probably because they are \"mediocre.\"  Yelp is the tally of collective impressions, and is usually \"spot-on.\"  I had never been to Midori, but saw the \"record\" and read some of the prior reviews.  True enough, everything we ordered was artistic, good quality and very tasty!  There were four of us feasting on many different varieties sushi, both hot and cold, and a few specialty entrees as well.  We ate until we were totally satiated.  We ordered three large imported Japanese beers plus a fountain drink and the total check came to $100, including tax!  Service was exceptional, the decor was comfortable and welcoming.  I am pleased to add my voice to \"the collective\" in giving Midori the highest possible rating."}
{"text":"First time I was here the service was super fast and nice! My friend and I met here for dinner before a movie and the atmosphere is so nice that we skipped the movie and stayed to chat."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout but have eaten here once before a while back, I ordered sashimi sliver for my daughter and sashimi gold for myself I also added uni nigiri and a spicy tuna cut roll. The sashimi came with rice, salad and miso soup I ordered off the lunch menu. Ok once I got my food I looked at it and it looks so good I couldn't help but dig in right in the car while my husband drives to pick up my daughter from school lol I was also excited to show her what I got her for lunch, well the first thing I took a bite of was the uni and omg it was so yummy I know sometimes you get a bad one and a good one but this one was so damn good I can't stop thinking about it lol, next I took a piece of spicy tuna and it was also good for something so simple they do it well but idk why the rice was brown looking I'm wondering if it's brown rice or is just season with something but it didn't matter how it look it tasted good to me. The sashimi gold had Tuna, salmon, yellowtail and super white tuna everything was so good but I think I definitely over ate from being hungry and excited lol. When I picked up my daughter I showed her what I got her and she was excited also the sashimi sliver included tuna salmon and yellowtail she loves salmon so I know she's going to say that's good already but she never tried yellowtail so I was happy she gave it a try and she actually mention she loved it and that when she gets sushi again she would order yellowtail lol but the tuna was ok to her she didn't enjoy that much but I didn't mind it so I ate it for her lol I was super full but it was so good I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is across the street from my office building. I really had high hopes for this place since the reviews seem favorable. Sadly, that wasn't my experience.

The best part about this place is its convenience and its service. I felt the staff was very attentive and speedy. The place wasn't packed, so I was able to get served immediately.  If it wasn't for this, the rating would be a star lower.

The food looks way better than it tastes. I ordered a bento box with teriyaki salmon with a spicy crab/shrimp tempura roll. Almost everything I ate seemed a bit off. The small salad was nice and fresh tasting. However, the miso soup tasted like it came from an instant soup packet and was saltier than what I prefer. The gyoza was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. You can get the same gyoza everywhere else.

As for the seafood, this did not taste fresh at all. I only took a few bites of the salmon before deciding that it wasn't worth it. I finished my sushi roll, but out of sheer hunger. This stuff tasted old.

If anything, the food here inspired me to cook my own salmon tonight. I came into this place with an actual salmon craving. It looks like if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing! Moved from Orlando and have found my sushi spot 5 minutes from home. Thank you Midori! Gyoza was amazing and the Sauce was great on the sushi rolls as well. Green tea was fresh! Affordable prices too. Great job and will be back"}
{"text":"We went upon getting a rave review from a friend. Midori is wonderful - sushi and sashimi are outstanding! We actually went twice last week. It was that good!"}
{"text":"We wanted to get away from the night life and see what's beyond the strip, and found this remarkable gem located about 5 miles in the outskirts of Vegas.

SERVICE.  We were immediately greeted from both the waitress and the sushi chefs.  They asked where we wanted to sit, and of course, we requested the sushi bar.  Throughout the night, they were very attentive to our needs despite how busy they were. Our water and green tea were always full, and they asked us if wanted another order of sake right when we were done. LOVE IT!

Now for the important stuff-- FOOD!
This place is known for their exotic Japanese fusion rolls so we asked Chef Alex what he recommended.  He seemed real busy at the time and we thought he ignored us but right when we started looking at the menu, he immediately handed us a long plate and said, \"chef's special roll of the day\".  A salmon roll wrapped in vegies with a bit caviar on top.  We couldn't figure out what his special sauce was but it was super flavorful and tasty!  Other crazy rolls he made were, Tuna Wasabi Aoli, Yellow Tail Jalapeno, Fish and Fruit Roll, and Volcano Roll.  All super exotic and weird but something about them made us want more!

We also got the deep fried SOFT SHELL CRAB, and OMG the soft shell crab was AMAZING! This was one of my favorite dish because it was fried to a light crisp that you can eat the entire crab.  Not over battered and not over fried. 

We had to splurge and couldn't leave without getting the Tonkatsu pork cutlet.  Another great dish that was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  They even flavored their rice.  Yummm...

VENUE.  The decorative Japanese accents, wall art and lighting were not at all stuffy like most Japanese restaurants in Vegas so it was really nice to feel relaxed and comfortable.  The place was big and super clean.  

LOCATION.  You can miss it.  The only cute black and green sign that catches your eye when you drive in. Plenty of parking.

This is the perfect place for people who are into exotic specialty rolls.  They have an extensive menu but if you can't decide on what to get, ask Chef Alex and he'll be glad to make one of his own special creation just for you!  And the best part -- big portions and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for fresh innovative sushi. They have new ownership but same great Sushi. There is a new sashimi menu and I highly recommend the salmon sashimi's. They are all amazing."}
{"text":"The fish is really of good quality. The portions are good. The fish are nice and plump, especially the ebi. Most places have flat ebi, Flat ebi with a slice of lemon. What is happening? Are you hiding fishy smell???? Is your ebi not fresh? Midori's is wonderful. You will not find that here.
Quiet, off the Strip and a great respite. The only knock I give it is the background music. No clue what they use, but the music sounds like my grandparents era of Lawrence Welk while walking through Nordstroms. WTH???????"}
{"text":"Very horrible service. We came on a weeknight with less than 10 customers and 4 people working the sushi bar. We waited over 30-40 minutes for our order and it was only 3 simple rolls.  The waitress did not come by once (aside from bringing our drinks) to even acknowledge that we had been waiting so long. When we got up to check on our food, the guy at the sushi bar seemed annoyed and very abrupt. He basically snapped that our food was coming and once again did not acknowledge that we had been waiting so long. Once we did get the food it was truly sub par. Not worth the time or the price! Do not go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and fast. The service is efficient and friendly. They have both lunch and dinner specials, and also sushi lunch/dinner specials too yay. I had the sushi combo A and it came with 5 pieces of sushi, my choice of spicy tuna rolls, a miso soup and a salad. The spicy tuna rolls are actually the real spicy ones and not some tuna with hot sauce on it lolz. The nigiri were fresh and good too. It's a good deal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food & friendly staffs ! Hands down the best sushi restaurant in town !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good...It's clean, spacious and the staff were helpful.
We liked our box lunches, the salad had a different type of dressing-Good!! They use chicken breast- white meat , woohoo...Gyoza was very tasty (BF loved the gyoza) and you get to pick from a few rolls to be in your bento box which is nice to not have to get \"Mr. Usual California Roll\"...
They have a sushi roll made especially for the summer that has tempura shrimp, crab, avacado, cucumber and mango...I love mango so for mango to be in my sushi = I knew it had to be good and it sure was...
We watched the sushi chef make a few interesting rolls for a couple and in one roll he used a crepe as a substitute for rice and the lady kept raving about it..
We didn't spend alot of money-our lunch was $8.95 each and the summer roll was $8.95 as well.
All in all we liked our experience here and we will return"}
{"text":"A sweet and gentle place to eat sushi. Midori is tucked into the pebble market plaza toward the back and you could almost miss it if you move to fast thru the parking lot. And what a miss!  Their sushi is sublime. Lunches are nicely priced and delicious. Service is just right too!

Great place to meet privately for lunch or have a bigger open lunch with colleagues.  You can't go wrong. 

Very nice!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to! Everything on the menu is excellent, from the great selection of bento boxes, to the extremely high quality selection of sushi rolls and sashimi. I travel all over the US and Europe and have never found a better sushi spot. Relaxed and calming atmosphere with friendly service. Easy to get to if you are staying at Green Valley Ranch Casino. Absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"First time here ! Great food , great service ! We're pretty new to the Henderson area and this is the first sushi place we've tried ! They did not disappoint.. started wit miso soup and then DEATH OF DRAGON ROLL"}
{"text":"I love this place, and the sushi I have to say \"it's the best!!! Midori is really good."}
{"text":"Super good, in an intimate, this is \"your\" sushi bar kind of way. Great rolls, reasonable prices.  The lunch bento boxes are fab. Go :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great staff. Delicious food. Close to home. $9 chicken bento, comes with bottomless tea, soup, sushi roll & salad."}
{"text":"Service is ungodly slow. They messed up my sushi order. Kitchen order came towards the end of the meal. Appetizer order came at the very end of the meal. This place is dead on a Friday night, should have no excuse. I have no idea why the reviews are so good. If you're in no hurry and want mediocre \"sushi\" at best with some flavorless calamari for dessert, this is the place for you. My 2nd star is for refilling my water and bringing the bill out faster than everything else."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas and was in search of a Japanese restaurant close to where I live and found this place.  I mainly come here for the dinner specials which is basically a bento box, a Japanese style lunch box consisting of gyoza(potsticker), salad, tempura, sushi, and main entree.  It also comes with miso soup and rice.  The pricing is reasonable starting from $9+.  You can't go wrong with any of the bento box choices, I've tried them all and they were all terrific.  The only thing that I would probably not order again is their chirashi bowl which is an assortment of raw fish on top of sushi rice.  First off, the fish was not fresh.  Kind of disappointing.  But lesson learned.  

Although I had a small setback with the chirashi bowl, I will continue to visit this restaurant as the food is pretty decent and pricing is great!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are from out of town and staying at the Green Valley Ranch. We wanted to check out Midori from all the positive reviews it was getting on line. Good service, good portions and decent prices is what we got on our visit there on 7/11. No complaints. It is truly is a hidden gem in Henderson. We'll be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Overall this is a solid option for Japanese food and sushi in the Green Valley area.

We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. The inside is nicely decorated and very clean. We were quickly greeted and seated. 

They have a large menu and I was happy to see that even on weekends that they offer the bento box lunch specials. Most of the boxes are less than $10. Each box comes with soup, salad, and white rice. They even offer a vegetarian bento box option. The entire menu has pictures of what dishes look like and everything came out as pictured. 

The service was a definite highlight. Our waiter was one of the most attentive waiters I've ever had and he was the only waiter that afternoon. As soon as my husband's drink was getting low our waiter would appear and grab it to refill. He checked on us several times and cleared plates frequently, but only after making sure we wanted them cleared. He also packaged my leftovers for me when it was time.

My husband and I both ordered the bento boxes. His with Kobe Beef and a Spicy Crab Roll, mine with Teriyaki Chicken and Shrimp Tempura Roll. We also ordered Edamame, Kani Nachos, and a Jalapeno Popper Roll.  My husband loved the Kani Nachos and I enjoyed them as well. The Edmame, Jalapeno Popper Roll, Miso Soup, Salad, Gyoza, and White Rice were great. Neither my husband or I loved the beef and chicken with our Bento Boxes. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The rolls were okay, but not the best I've ever had. 

I loved the great service, great prices, and most of the food was good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved the name and design of their logo so we thought we would try it. We ordered 4 different rolls and they were unimpressive and the tuna did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Good sushi, good prices! So good the first time we came back less than a week later. Sushi was fresh and the curry had a nice spice. Service was great and quick."}
{"text":"this is our favorite sushi place now! Service is great and staff is very knowledgeable about the menu.  Husband found this place using Google and ever since then we  make sure to come here once a week. Love their sushi (better than Yummy Sushi). My only gripe is their restroom- i expected it to be better since the dining area is spotless."}
{"text":"Literally, hands down, the best place for sushi in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. Seriously this is better than the fancy pants overpriced sushi restaurants on the strip. I've never had anything here that wasn't extremely fresh and flavorful. The best time to go is at lunch. The lunch specials are large and very reasonably priced. Also, service is fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"The BEST. 

It's the perfect little spot for delicious fresh sushi. My favorite dishes are the...
-Spicy garlic edamame 
-Hawaiian roll
-Philadelphia roll add jalapeño 

My absolute favorite place in Henderson."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fresh sushi, low carb sushi if you desire, however there is no all you can eat here...Why? Probably because the food they serve here is high quality and good.

I would recommend this place and if you like good tasting, good quality, go visit this place.  Most of the time you can get filled up on two rolls."}
{"text":"I have only gotten to-go from here - chirashi for dinner.  It is nice enough but nothing outrageously amazing.  The sushi chef is from China.

The one time Eric R. and I came in for dinner, there was no one in the restaurant.  It was still open for 30 minutes, but the server who came to see who walked in indicated they would rather not take on new guests.  I am not sure why the open sign was on then...I have seen places close early when there are no partrons, but the sign was on so we definitely felt awkward and left...for a horrible styrofoam journey at China Tango.

I don't ever think of this place but if you are craving basic chirashi and are in the neighborhood, take it to go."}
{"text":"I love sushi and they are across the street from my job. I love coming here for lunch because they give such quick service. And they remember my additional request when I come in. The atmosphere is nice and calm and relaxing with dim lighting throughout"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in town, hands down! Ingredients are always fresh.. Their specials are so creative and everything I've had here is always mind blowing good! I'm not exaggerating, its really EVERYTHING!  The menu is perfect for all taste and diet. I'm so glad I live less than 2 miles away. This place is our happy place.

The service is always exceptional. Thanks to the sushi chef for being so awesome, and the rest of the staff for being amazing! Love this place, please continue doing what you guys do!"}
{"text":"Midori is the BEST kept secret sushi restaurant I have been to. 

I can not remember how many times I have ordered sushi from here. 
The place is very relaxing if you want to get away from work or stress. 
The ambiance is great and the customer service is the best!

They're never pushy and they're always so helpful and friendly. 
Although they do not have AYCE, their sushi is at a reasonable price. 

Their Sleepless in Seattle roll is great (Especially if your'e a philadelphia roll fan). 
I'm eel/avocado person so one of my favorites is the Kamikaze roll. 
The initial-D roll is another favorite of mine (It has mango in it so there's a sweet flavor to it). 

If you're looking for a place to chill and relax and eat a roll or two, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I agree with Aurora's review.  Place is clean and the food is good.  No one here except us.  Waiter is nice.  Can't complain.  Needed to find a place to eat near where we were at.  Feel bad that it was so empty."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Henderson! It's in a strip mall with plenty of parking. The outside looks very simple, but inside it was upscale casual and very welcoming. We were seated right away and ordered soft shell crab and calamari for starters. Both were really good and I liked the sweet vinegar dipping sauce a lot. They have dinner specials and I ordered the Bento box D, which included shrimp tempura, a choice of a sushi roll ( I picked the spicy tuna roll ), 2 pot stickers, and small green salad. It was a lot of food surprisingly and it was all very good. The lady who was our server was so sweet and attentive. She checked on our table to see how we were doing and answered my questions about some of the sauces I didn't know. The whole staff was just warm and friendly. It was a kinda empty when we went, but there was a few people having dinner and all seem to be having a good time. I was so full that I had to take some food home and it was enough for second servings for sure. Too bad I was too full for dessert, but I will definitely be back to try some. Also, with the dinner specials, the prices are very reasonable. I was also impressed with the attention to presentation. Overall, the food is fresh, the place is clean and the service is absolutely outstanding. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh food amazing flavor. A must for anyone who appreciates sushi. Wide variety of sushi options and some new fun items to try."}
{"text":"a hidden gem! haven't ordered anything on the menu that i didnt like.  very friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's just ok.. I don't have anything really awful to say. I did order the spiciest item on the menu the \"Green fossil\" and it was sweet to me but they assured me spicy to others... 
Well alrighty then... decent food....nothing spectacular.. Of course it was my first visit close to closing time
So I am eager to try them out again! I'd like to add good service!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It's right down the street from work and my boyfriend and I always go here to get our sushi fix. We're fans of cut rolls and we have never been disappointed with any of the rolls at Midori. Unlike most other sushi restaurants, they have a great rice to fish ratio. They also have an awesome happy hour! I can't really say much about their other menu items, but with ingredients as fresh and delicious as those I've had, something tells me that you can't go wrong eating here.

With food this delicious and a very attentive staff, Midori keeps us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place a unreal. The atmosphere was glorious. It was so quiet and serene. The service was perfect, they were so attentive.

I recommend the Ugly Roll. If seriously tastes like breakfast in your mouth, like bacon and pancakes!!!! I had the Sashimi which was amazing. I would totally return!!! Their menu is great. I wanted a no carb sushi option with no rice and they have if in the menu. Definitely returning!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda impressed overall.

1.  Parking - Strip Mall, no issue.

2.  Hours - 12:00 pm to 9:00 pm, so if for lunch, don't go before noon,

3.  Decor - Very nice. Plenty of tables and can seat I would think up to seventy people.  Also has nice sushi bar.

4.  Service - Went during the week at 12:30 and there were probably 7 or so different parties. Not too bad, although my wife ordered a cooked bento meal and I order the Chirashi which is raw sliced fish and it took about 10 minutes after she got her meal that I received mine.

5.  Food - I will have to come back for the sushi, however, this is not an AYCE place, it is more specific to ordering per person something.  They have great lunch specials, something like 10 or so different bento lunches.  

Bento Box - I found the to be fine, but with the basics in them and not all the fun authentic nice tasting little things you would find in a true bento  box. However, for the American Japanese taste, I believe you will find all of it appealing, nicely presented and tasty. 

Chirashi - You can tell the quality of the place by the raw fish. Here, this is a lunch special and it is chef's choice on which raw sliced fish to give you. I found the selection from Mirugai, to Ika, Maguro and Ebi to name a few quite nice overall.  However, if I am going to have Ebi, I always expect to have the head and stuff deep fried and served and they did not do that here.

6.  Summary - I found the place quite nice overall and would go back. It did not remind me as \"authentic\" as I have had at other places or even in key Japanese places, however, still pretty darn good overall.

Check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh sushi! Price points are right one for the nice cut quality of fish. Not AYCE but that's ok. Did the sake sampler which was awesome - thanks to our server for help in picking our sake choices. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally, a delicious, HEALTHY sushi place in the Las Vegas area. My husband and I have tried closed to 20 sushi restaurants in town and this is our new favorite. Their sushi is good but their low carb cucumber-wrapped sushi and sashimi is the reason we keep coming back. The best low carb options are the oisis, 3 musketeers, and lazyboy. We really enjoyed the tuna sashimi tower. Service is excellent and the inside is beautiful. This place is a must for any sushi lover :]"}
{"text":"It's odd to say that originally I give this place an OK rating, however, I always seem to find myself coming back because of the convenience.  I just had to change my perspective of this place and actually give them a better rating than before. 

The other day, I took my employee out for lunch here.  We didn't have time for a full service sushi lunch, so we decided to get the sushi combination A for about $10.  It's actually a good deal!  You start with some miso soup brought to you.  I enjoy the taste of it and they put a lot of tofu in it, so you're having a great soup overall!  On the plate is 5 different nigiri sushi like shrimp, ahi, hamachi, salmon and more.  You also can choose spicy tuna sushi roll as well.  The overall dish is light and perfect for a light lunch.  

The place is small, but very intimate and offers a surprisingly cool vibe.  I enjoy the sushi bar, ample seating and the fake bamboo tree wall, breaking up the monotony of the entire room.  Their bathrooms are clean and the staff is actually very nice.  

Overall, it's not the most \"authentic\" of sushi restaurants, however it still does the trick for me.  I'd probably say that this place is pretty darn good and practical if you're looking for a sushi joint in the Green Valley Area!"}
{"text":"I come here every time Im in Vegas. Their sushi is exceptionally fresh. 

Their lunch special is a deal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far my favorite restaurant. I always always always order a bento box. I have never left this place unsatisfied. Their fried calamari is amazing as well but just a tad small for the price your paying for it..
Although the bento box is the way to go, they have everything to fill you up with just $10-$15 dollars. This has amazing customer service and I plan on coming here more and more! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Called in & picked up a few rolls to go with a friend who lives in the area. Fresh & delicious! We didn't eat in but the atmosphere was really pretty & the staff was friendly. My friend goes there regularly & says it's her fave in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to try this place out. Atmosphere very chill and relaxing and the service was great. The menu is well organized and had so many options! Loved the bento box combos, very well  priced. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. It lost a star because the chicken was a bit dry, but the salmon was perfectly cooked: I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  We started with yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. The mouth feel was ok, but it was not he freshest. Next was the salmon sashimi. This was good, but the cut was a bit thick and too much for one bite. Finally, I got the Icy spicy. The fish was mutilated ruining the texture, and it didn't taste fresh at all. 

I am only giving 3 stars because the service was great and the chef was kind."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for mother's day with my family and we overall had a great experience! The staff were attentive and friendly. Excellent customer service and had no problems at all. I'd definitely come here again when I'm in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"I went there with my family on a whim tonight for the first time.  I was craving some sushi and literally went to the first place I found on my Yelp phone app.  Im glad I did as I found a place I see myself going to many more times.  

I was shocked a bit by the lack of clientele for a Saturday night but I did not let that stop us and you shouldn't either.

The menu has a good assortment of offerings.  Lots of variety which my daughter liked and combination dinners which I thought were great.  They also have non sushi items which my wife, who hates sushi, enjoyed.

The service was excellent, The food was well presented and tasted good, and I got out of a sushi restaurant with my wallet intact, which is a surprise.  

Over all a good experience, I would recommend Midori to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is truly a must go to for people in Green Valley area that are a fan of sushi, or eastern cuisine in general. It's hidden in the corner of a large shopping plaza on the far left, and sadly, when my husband and I went there weren't many people there. The interior is very nice. It is serene and extremely relaxed. The music that they play there is also pleasant. I take not of that, because most Chinese and Japanese places you go to play not so Chinese and Japanese music (aka top 40's or Disney songs turned into piano..yes, the last one has happened once.) 

If the place is empty, you are allowed to sit anywhere you like and the server comes to you quickly. They are nice, polite, and ALWAYS on top of your water, but do not hover around you to the point of awkwardness. The prices are pretty standard when it comes to sushi, and the menu is HUUUGGGGEEE. At least 6 pages, I think. They have all sorts of rolls available, and even low carb ones. I opted for the Dinner B which included teriyaki chicken, rice, tempura, miso soup, 6 rolls (you get to choose from 4-5 kinds) and a salad.

Onward to the food. Delicious. Nuff said. Anywho, as said in my tip, I'm in love with their spicy tuna rolls. I've been to quite a few sushi joints where they claim to have spice tuna, but that is, indeed, a myth. This place brings the right amount of heat with their roll and oohh, it's so good! The presentation of the food is top notch. It looks so pretty that you kind of feel bad eating it. This can be said with their sushi as well. (My husband ordered the Sushi dinner.) Their teriyaki sauce was sweet and lacked the salty taste that you get at a lot of other placed. I liked that. This has been dubbed my new sushi joint in Henderson, and if you are ever in the Green Valley area, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We had dinner there the other night.  It's a cozy little restaurant.  The sushi was good , not the best I've ever had, but it was nice presentation.  I did notice that the bathroom was not well maintained and could use some updating.  I think poorly maintained restrooms tells a lot about a restaurant, because if they don't keep that clean, then they likely don't keep their kitchen which the consumers don't see clean.  With that said, I will probably go back because the service was good and I did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and good sushi. A lot of options to choose from.
Its kind of a romantic restaurant, really calm. Our waitress was really nice. We spend 30 bucks for 2 people and we are leaving happy"}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi all over Las Vegas / Henderson NV sense 1990 the food at Midori is excellent in quality and portions and very affordable.  I give this place 5 stars hands down bar none this place is one of the best in the region."}
{"text":"A great Sushi and Japanese restaurant. They have excellent sushi with great prices. Their bento specials are the best deal, large portions delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"This place looks fancy from outside and you maybe scared by your assumption of the pricing. But what you find is a very well and beautifully designed restaurant with more then affordable prices. No funny smells like you have in some sushi restaurants. Very nice tables ... Great room layout and decoration . . very friendly staff ... And fantastic food ... The price is just amazing ... I couldn't believe how cheap it was for such a classy place. Unbelievable ... I will be a regular there. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"For my last dinner of 2016, we closed the place down! I enjoyed my sushi choice of a Smoky Bourbon roll with bacon & tuna. Pretty sure this was the first time I've had a bacon sushi roll, and it shall not be the last. Not a bad way to spend NYE!

I enjoyed the intimate setting in this place, and diners all cleared out shortly after we got there.  We came in for the \"last seating\" on NYE, which was around 8:30. The decor is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, and it has a sushi bar and dining room seating. Service was good and we never felt ignored. 

The menu choices are vast and prices are reasonable. We had a small bottle of sake to share and they presented it like it was a $100 bottle of champagne, on ice! Impressive. It was a memorable meal and a great first time visit here as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Wonderful food. And nice atmosphere. Really enjoyed the piano music in the background.

{"text":"I was reading my review while having dinner here the other night and couldn't believe it was almost 4 years old. Midori truly is a hidden gem and still one of my favorite restaurants in Henderson. 

You can't beat the ambience or amount of food you get for the money here. It is always quiet and peaceful inside and the service is consistently personable. The bento box dinner is around $12 and includes soup, gyoza, tempura, rice, a sushi roll, salad and your protein! I usually opt for the teriyaki salmon but they have chicken, beef and tonkatsu as well. 

The sushi here has always been fresh and delicious and they have a nice selection of japanese beers and sake. If you find yourself wanting a peaceful inexpensive dinner Midori can't be beat."}
{"text":"We love Midori! All the rolls are super delicious and worth every penny! The plus is that you are able to substitute white rice with brown rice for a fee which isn't offered in a lot of sushi houses. They also have the \"Midori\" rolls which are wrapped in cucumber  instead of rice. Another favorite is the \"One is Enough\" roll. It comes with crunchy goodness and shrimp tempura. They have a spider roll and a black widow which are great as well that has soft shell crab. Bento boxes are great for lunch too! Very good pricing."}
{"text":"I believe I have eaten here about three times I definitely love the location the service is very good here decent to corner and I think that the sushi is acceptable it's got a weird atmosphere though I think that's the only thing that ever felt a little weird to me"}
{"text":"this is an excellent sushi restaurant. We come here regularly for lunch. It has a good ambience and great service. I highly recommend the low carb sushi rolls. The rolls are rice-less and extremely delicious!!  one of our favorite places to eat!!"}
{"text":"I had a very nice lunch in this comfortable and attractive restaurant. I was attended to promptly and often. I would easily recommend this place to family and friends."}
