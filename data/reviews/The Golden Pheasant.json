{"text":"A previous reviewer mentioned that the schnitzel is the size of a new born baby and I disagree--it's much bigger. :) The portions are HUGE. The schnitzel was tender and came with a lemon wedge. We ordered potato salad as the side and it was nice and creamy. This is hearty food. I've never had Slovak potato dumplings before but I think I've found my new comfort food. If you're a fan of creamy, melted cheese, bacon and potato pasta you must try this. Must.  The restaurant is a bit like a sports bar but the table and chairs remind me of a banquet hall. The server was nice and attentive and the cook even came out to chat. I'll be back to try more items on the menu even though I have to google most of them to understand what they are."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my most favourite European restaurant in Mississauga. Their foods are delicious. Every bite is worth a penny. They  offer reasonable prices (around $15) and have gigantic servings.My fiance and mother-in-law are Europeans and they loved the foods as well. I ordered potato pancake with pork and mushroom inside it. It was yummy! Because they have big servings, we needed to take the half of our foods  home. This is a must-see place in Lakeshore and in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! Truly authentic european cuisine. Started with the chicken noodle soup which was rich and flavorful. The schnitzel afterwards did not disappoint ... it was huge ... but authentic. Delicious flaky crust and tender meat. All of the sides were tasty as well ... potatoes with a little caramelized onions and a wonderful homemade cabbage salad / sauerkraut. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I came with a friend and ordered 1 schnitzel to share. When we got our food, we didn't get the \"how's your food\" question compared to the other guests. Maybe cause we were younger looking compared to the others? When we got the bill, $18.99 for the schnitzel with the potato salad plus a $1.50 charge for splitting the portion with my friend. OUTRAGEOUS. I felt like outcasts in this restaurant. Is not like they were busy. There were just 1 other couple in the restaurant at the time. Server didn't check up on us until our food was done. Suggest you skip this place if you're not white. 3 is a generous rating."}
{"text":"Massive schnitzel portion fit for two or three to eat. Very crispy and tasty. We got this with the potato salad which was spot on tart and not too creamy. Inside is a pub like environment with the occasional sprinkle of Chezch decor. Good service and inviting atmosphere. Will be back to try the goulash!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, fresh and huge portions!  They accommodate special requests.  Must order in advance but one of us ordered duck and it was cooked to perfection.  Another if us ordered chicken schnitzel which was also special order.  Super food!  Go for the food, perhaps not the greatest service (slow and forgetful) but the food is a must if you like this type of fare."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the GTA, I hope to come here many times with my fictitious future wife who also has an appreciation for heavy, hearty Eastern European food and accents. Ambience isn't much, but that's part of the charm. Quite authentic (the menu is not in english last time I checked)."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews (and looking at the photos), there was no doubt I needed to try this restaurant.  I came with my mother and brother, and initially my mother was not impressed with the simplicity of the restaurant interior.  It is only a single room, half of which is filled with restaurant tables, the other half with a pool table, dart board, several wall-mounted TVs, a small performance stage and a bar at the back.  At 5pm on a Sunday we were also the only ones there for the duration of our meal (our server even turned the lights on just for us).  Despite this, we were comfortable at our table, and our server was soft-spoken and courteous.  Now, the food.  Their menu does not offer a large number of choices, but if everything they do they do well, I am satisfied with that.  I ordered the beef goulash and my mother ordered the roast pork and sauerkraut.  Both came with bread dumplings to soak up the sauces.  From the moment our plates hit the table, I knew this was going to be worth it.  The goulash was tender and flavorful though not strongly spiced.  The roast pork was tender to the point that it fell apart as you picked it up with a fork.  The bread dumplings were soft and chewy.  Even my mother, on tasting the sauerkraut, said that it was just like her mother used to make.  That's high praise from her for food from any restaurant.  I'm not sure what the place is like later in the evening, with the pool table and the stage with large speakers so close to the dining tables, but at an early dinner hour it was family friendly, perhaps if only because it was deserted.  I guess either not enough people in Mississauga know this place exists, or not enough have an appreciation for east European food.  I might have given four stars, taking one off for the ambiance of the restaurant, but I just can't give anything less than five based on the food."}
{"text":"Best food I have had in years!!  Large portions, great prices, share a meal.  I have traveled Europe and the food here beats most of them.  Everything in this restaurant is original.  I am glad I live too far away to come every day!"}
{"text":"Finally a place where you can really get your money valued for \"your schnitzel\". LOL  ...and I'm not just talking about the value for your moolah. I'm talking about the quality of the food.  The Golden Pheasant is a restaurant that will satisfy all appetites.  They are friendly and they'll do whatever to make you at home while dining out. You have many delicious entrees to choose from: WeinerSchnitzel, Chicken Paprikash, Goulash, Stroganoff, Dobos.  Good luck trying to finish it!"}
{"text":"Holy schnit-bottoms!!   Out of words for how amazing the food was. A MUST try if you are ever in town. The holy mother of schnitzels, they are frikken massive, and cooked to perfection. Topped over one of theeee best potato salads I have ever lived to try.  Halusky tasted equally amazing, so amazing my kids killed their plates in less than 5 minutes..unheard of. $14.99 is the perfect price if you consider sharing your meal. The place is really outdated and you will get a few strange stares if you're Asian like me, but everyone was so sweet including all the customers who wished us a Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"SUPER tasty food and fair prices. The schnitzel is literally the size of a small child so be prepared to eat a LOT!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a Sunday night and we waited for about 30-45mins. There was only 1 server at that time. Most items in the menu does not have English description so you will have to guess what it is or google if you dont understand their language.  They're popular for their humongous Schnitzel which is perfect with either rice or fries. I'm not a fan of fried foods so I ordered roasted pork with bread dumpling and sauerkraut and it was SO good. The meat was so soft which is similar to Philippines' pork lechon and the sauerkraut compliments the taste of the pork.   Overall, everything was good except for the wait time. I hope they get another helper."}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a very old friend who highly recommended it and said that I'd like the food.  He knows me you see because although I may only see him a couple times a year, we've known each other going on 4 decades.  This place is located just a block east of Cawthra on the north side of Lakeshore right on the corner of West Avenue.  This is convenient in a sense that you can say that you're just going down the corner if you chose to walk here if you lived nearby.  The reason I used \"place\" to describe this establishment is that I really don't know what to call it.  It's like a hangout that just happens to have food and drink.  It would be or could be the epitome of a local hang out because it doesn't really feel like a bar or a restaurant but more like a legion.  I'm not saying the décor is not inviting but upon stepping into the place I felt immediately out of place and at home at the same time.  Yes, I know that doesn't really make sense but the out of place feeling was that we were standing around waiting to be seated when the place is so casual  that there's no need to stand around - just sit and relax.  There are the kind of tables and chairs I'd expect to find at an old fish and chips place.  It's like that old 70's-80's type seating and no-nonsense table tops.  This place is so casual that there's no need to feel out of place I suppose.  I went with my wife and our friend for dinner on a Friday evening.  We sat a table adjacent to the pool table.  It would be possible that if some people wanted to play pool that they'd have to be careful as to not poke us with the cues.  The place isn't that tight but I'm just trying to emphasize how laid back this place seems to be.  The bar almost looks like the type of bar my dad built in our basement before when I was a kid.  It looks homemade and it goes with the place.  The patrons seemed to be an older crowd but local.  I could imagine many people walking here from just up the street because we had to park in front of a house half a block up.  While there's some parking it's not as if there were that many cars surrounding the place.  The Golden Pheasant really has a home feel to it and it is what I'd consider old school.  Whether it's the food, the community or the social factor, this place has their niche in the area.  Oh and they just happen to serve some crazy sized servings of good food as well.  The menu is short and I suppose they can simply impress with the short list they have.  I had to go with the schnitzel because that's what my friend recommended I get.  He assured me that I'd be satisfied with the portion size.  He knows me and knows I like Zet's and other places that give abnormally large portions of food.  With all the patrons inside I was curious to see plates but I wasn't nosy enough to intrude.  We ordered and I figured I'd just wait.  When the plates arrived my reaction verbatim was, \"What the hell?\".  Yes, I sort of embarrassingly blurted that out loud.  It was a shock to see a platter of food placed in front of me.  The thing is I was warned that it would be a lot and still, it never really clicked in until I had a firsthand visual.  The wheels start turning in my head in how I'm going to approach this already mentally conceding that I most likely won't eat all of this.  My wife had some sort of pancake thing with meat and I wasn't concerned with hers knowing we'd be taking hers home for sure.    I was stunned.  I guess I was just caught off guard.  I've seen big plates and this was one of them.  Sure it's a crazy size but how was it?  The schnitzel was covering an entire bed of fries underneath.  There was a small side of veggies as well but this schnitzel was intimidating.  Still, I had to cut in and take the first bite.  Nice and hot, crispy coating just like how freshly fried things should be.  Traditional fare?  I suppose and I noticed places that serve schnitzel there's no offering of any kind of sauce or whatever.  This is how it's served and lacking any side flavoring, it's straight up great.  The fries as well, hot, crispy and fresh.  This plate is a good tasting heap of fried food and it's barely 20 bucks.  It's enough to feed two normal adults but besides the generous serving for the price it's really good as well.  There's a closer schnitzel place to where I live but this place is not that far out of the way either.  I must say the hype is real.  Every once in a while, I like me a good schnitzel and this place surpasses expectations for their bang for the buck and quality of their serving.  While the menu had a few more options I'm sort of a creature of habit.  I have my favorite thing to have at each place and I rarely deviate from it.  I'll see if my wife can have something different next time so I can try something new and I'll end up sharing whatever she wants from my plate as well.    The Golden Pheasant is one of those places where ambiance is a second thought because their food is that good."}
{"text":"Soooo good.  We ordered schnitzel, chicken parikash and some huge chunk of meat with stuff. Portion is out of the world and the quality is just top notch.   Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"This must be a hidden gem because I drive by it often and I never knew it was there! Looking for schnitzel heaven? This is where you will find it.   I was forewarned by the other yelpers to expect my portion to be huge. I suggested to my partner we should share. I was still caught off guard when our meal arrived! It was larger than I expected and it was so crispy and delicious. Add the potato salad, because it is so worth it! Next time I'm going to double up on the potato salad because it was that tasty."}
{"text":"No word of a lie, this schnitzel is like the size of a newborn baby. See attached picture with the schnitzel beside a cell phone, to really gage its enormity - if you put two faces together, this schnitzel would still be bigger!   Overall, what a fantastic spot. Massive portions, sweet and friendly service, decent prices, and a random but charming bar-you-can-find-in-a-small-village-in-Europe vibe. Not the most upscale spot - but its rustic, homely simplicity was endearing to me.   We took the advice of other Yelpers and ordered just one plate to share of the 'Wiener schnitzel with boiled potatoes' ($15.99), and last minute added a side of french fries ($4.50) to our order, because we worried one dish wouldn't be enough to satiate our hunger - big mistake. Two days later, I'm still eating those leftover fries.  The schnitzel is super crispy, crunchy, but cooked perfectly - and the potato salad bed under the schnitzel was the best potato salad I've ever had.  Wonderful creaminess and tang. It's a super comforting meal, and I'll definitely come back for this again and again.  For two people, with tax and tip, we paid $27. Note that if the small parking lot is full, you can park on the side street just east of the restaurant on West Avenue."}
{"text":"Best Slovak food I've had in Canada, and probably much better than some restaurants I've been to in Slovakia. the Svietkova, Segedin Gula and the Halusky are amazing. Love the new look and that they have a pool table."}
{"text":"Whoa.  So you know those square takeout containers? Yes, those ones.. Well, the schnitzel I ordered today was too big for it to close so Eva just had to leave it open slightly, which was great, because I could smell it all the way home..   Then I started eating.. yum.. Yes, it was a little deep-fried-tasting, but it's deep-fried! What do I expect?! It was really amazing though -- the quarter of it that I got through before having to put it in the fridge for a snack later..  Oh! And the potato salad! Amazing.. Creamy, potatoes were soft as they should be, pretty great..  The ambience of the restaurant itself seemed to me like it would be a hall where people would hold wedding receptions or something, more than a 'bar' ambience, but it did have a nice-looking pool table that I will most-likely use next time..."}
{"text":"This is a Czech place and the food is staple Central-European.  The Vienese Schnitzel is humongous! You will have two meals there!  It also tastes quite good, though I was not over-excited about the roughly chopped cabbage on which it was served.. The chicken paprikash was also good, but I've had better.  Large portion again.  It might look pricey for an eastern-european eatery, but the portion sizes make up for that.  Service is friendly, in an eastern european manner.  Don't expect the server buzzing over you every 5 mins. The pints of Czechvar went very good with the food."}
{"text":"The Golden Pheasant (TGP) is 1,277 miles (2,055 km for you Canucks) away from my home. I know because I looked it up. Because that's what I do when I'm missing a restaurant. I obsess over it. And I obsess over TGP frequently. I mean, it's hard not to because they really know their schnitzel.  Words can't begin to describe how much I love TGP. Everything about this place is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious. Yes, the schnitzel is on point, but mother of pearl, that potato salad (you can't really see it in the pictures; it's under the schnitzel) is the stuff of dreams.   You may be thinking, \"It's potato salad, guy... Calm yourself.\" To which I respond, \"No, shut your stupid face, you don't even know.\" And there's enough food that you can share one serving. Not that you would want to, but it's an option.  I'm coming back in December, TGP. You're my third stop, right after I grab a double-double, and some Chilli Chicken House. ::insert excited squealing Jonah Hill pose here::"}
{"text":"Schnitzel comes as two ginormous portions, more than enough for a very large meal or can be split into two meals. A bit tight for room, but I am there for the food, which was awesome.  Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I have to say I will go back next time I'm in town. Food was amazing, really amazing. Nothing fancy - it's like food that you would get in Slovak restaurant. I had bryndzove halusky - again very good - can't believe I eat them all - it was a big plate . Would definitely recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews and new to area. Although it's not the nicest looking spot (don't take your date here on a Friday night!), the food is amazing! Very large portions, great taste, fast service. Definitely coming here often when I need a last minute meal (or two) =)"}
{"text":"The chef is an unbelievably modest and nice man! Probably my favorite chef in the GTA. And the food is amazing! The schnitzel and potato salad is to die for."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/service are NOT the reasons to check out The Golden Pheasant!  As it lacks on both fronts.  Location:  Technically, I think this place is in Lakeview, west of Port Credit.  It's close to the infamous Dairy Cream.  Atmosphere:  As per the other reviews, it's like a mix between hall / neighbourhood dive bar / legion.  When I arrived tonight, my group sat away from the door, near the bar, and it was FREEZING.  I had to put my coat on my lap 'cause there was a draught!  The only thing I can think of is that the heat was not on.   There was still daylight out, but interior light seemed to be from 3 torchieres and the bar area.  Fluorescent lights were not on.  There were a coupla drunk-ish, but harmless men just drinking at the bar.  Service:  Could've been friendlier.  The younger female server had an apathetic attitude.  Me & my party agreed that it looked like she hated her job!  Food:  Weiner Schnitzel was pretty good, not super thin, and definitely not greasy.  Definitely HUGE portion as per all the reviews/photos.  I think a normal sized female could eat about 1/4 - 1/2 of the entire piece of meat.   Potato Salad, which is supposed to be \"amazing\" tasted very, very similar to the Red Potato Salad available at Costco.  So although it was good, I was not blown away.    Price:  It was $20 for half a portion of schnitzel + a Czech beer.  If you don't drink, it's like $11-12.  So definitely a decent portion:value.  Waitress gave herself 10% tip automatically on the bill.  It did make me not hafta do math, but not sure how I felt about this.  It's a shame that the atmosphere/service was not more welcoming 'cause I'm pretty sure that it would be more popular!!!"}
{"text":"This was a very good European restaurant. It was a casual kinda homey atmosphere. The service was good. The beer on tap was very good. The menu had a nice selection to choose from and all 4 of us had no complaints. We all enjoyed are meal. We shall return."}
{"text":"This place has been on my to try list for a while. Pulling in front you are unimpressed and when you walk in the decor is straight out of the 70's. Tables and chairs are very simple. As for the service and food, well that is a different story. Nice server who knew some English but my wife speaks Cezch so no problems. The food is absolutely bloody amazing with ginormous portions. We would absolutely go back in a second. The one star off is purely for the decor. I highly recommend a try!"}
{"text":"I have been a LOYAL patron here for MANY years, but after tonight I will never come here again.   I just called to make an order for pickup, and the owner / chef tells me, \"NO, no way man we are so busy it's like an hour wait for in restaurant.\" I was a little stunned at first and asked him if he was joking, and then he said, \" No try in a few hours maybe. \"  Absolutely ridiculous, who talks like that? I'm from Eastern Europe so I'm use to people with the people skills of wood, but this was bad even for me.   I suggest the owner hire someone else to start fielding phone calls and PLEASE hire a REAL kitchen staff. Your food is great, but you posses the organizational skills of a 3 year old. Teach a real kitchen staff so you can stop turning orders away because you're too proud to not cook it yourself.   Garbage owner, jebi svoju Mamu!!!"}
{"text":"The schnitzel is AMAZING. The potato salad is literally the best I have ever had in my life. The portions are HUGE. It's a very casual family restaurant with great food. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"With the schnitzel being the size of two heads, this place does not disappoint.   Walking in, the place has a real homely vibe / family restaurant feel to it. The patrons all seem to be regulars and despite them chatting with the staff, they still manage to make sure you get attended to as well.   The waitress brought us water right away and told us that the special was roasted duck..... but I was here for the schnitzel and potato salad right!? There was no going back, no menu needed I was full speed ahead on the schnitzel train! Toot toot!!!!   Here's some of the secret information that you best be warned about; if you like me and have to share your order because you can't smash right through a map of the world sized schnitzel, they charge you $1.50 more to share. Do the sides of boiled potatoes, rice or fries not appeal to you because you heard about the potato salad? Yes .....get the potato salad. Yeah, you pay another $1.50 for it - get it, it's the best $1.50 you're going to spend.   So lemme get back to this schnitzel which was modelled on the ears of an elephant. It was sooo sooo delicious. Crispy, flavourful breading with that tender schnitzel covered in gooey potato salad and zinged with a touch of pickled veggies. That's delicious!   $21 bill paid, 2 people stuffed full with some left overs to take home. Not bad at all pheasant folk..... not bad at all!"}
{"text":"My first review on yelp! yay. At the The Golden Pheasant, I ordered a Chicken Schnitzel platter which came with fries and two salads. I'm always on a quest to find the best schnitzel around and I can say that the one here is the best I have ever tasted in Canada. It was season perfectly, crispy, fresh and hot as it should be. Their schnitzel on the menu is done with pork; however, you can request to have it done in chicken.  The other thing that is great also, is they offer the option to share the portion; therefore you can order a platter or meal and share with something. My girlfriend and I were able to share the chicken schnitzel platter. I have been here four times already and cannot be happier. The service is great and the best time to go is when it opens, which is 5 o clock. The food takes a bit but not too long, but you will not be disappointed since it is hot and fresh! If you are a fan of central/eastern European food, please give this restaurant a try. You may have to park on the street if the parking lot is full."}
{"text":"Ordered the Schnitzel and will order it again. Was quite MASSIVE in size. Got it with rice,  potato salad and reg salad. All was very yummy! Ordered the Schnitzel and went to pick up. I would only take food to go from here. Place has pool tables and a very east european interior with sports jerseys and just a rustic vibe, which is not BAD AT ALL! Just NOT my cup of tea. Food again was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the neighbourhood for quite some time and this was the first time trying The Golden Pheasant.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Upon coming into the restaurant, it's a little out dated, but despite that the food was delicious!! Our server was a lovely young lady, who was very nice and attentive.  My husband had the Wiener Schnitzel, with the potato salad. It was huge.  He couldn't stop raving about it and I snuck a piece and had say it was delicious. I had the pork tenderloin with mushroom gravy.. it was melt in your mouth delicious!! Also, the prices are very reasonable!! We will definitely be going back! Absolute hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"If you are in search of some good European cuisine, The Golden Pheasant will appeal to your taste buds.  We went to this place with a Group of Seven (not the painters, just a group of people, family, although I guess the Group of Seven at one point would have been a family too because they were so close together, but that's not the point).  We went to this restaurant to try some authentic Czech cuisine.    We tried their Czech beer, Czechvar, which was served as a draft at this place.  The experience is highly decorated with authentic Czech music playing in the background, folkloric attires and displays decorating the walls, and great service staff and of course, very tasty food.    We had the special, which included a duck or chicken soup, and a plate of duck with dumplings and cabbage (the name of which you will have to excuse me for).  The meal was served with a side dish of a pastry that tasted great with the duck meat.  The duck came cooked nicely broiled and definitely flavourful.  The owner came to our table and gave us a tasting portion of duck foie gras pate, which was rich in flavour and tasted great with the bread.  For dessert I tried (again I do not know the name) a pastry that was similar to a donut but not fried, and filled with a mixture of dough, cocoa, and fig jam.  Simply a delicious way to finish a great meal.    I did not eat my entire meal because it was a very big plate.  I ended up saving about half of it for later because there was no way that I was going to leave it behind!!   While we were at the restaurant a gentleman played the accordion.  I am not sure if it was a regular means of entertainment; however, the beautiful sounds added to the already great experience.  During our meal the owner walked around and asked how our meal was and also mentioned that they will soon (in March - date to be confirmed, but somewhere around the 28th...) be having a wild boar dinner.  This is something that we would like to try and I will definitely be back to try it out!!  The place just recently opened but I can see that it will definitely keep busy.  Along Lakeshore Road East, just east of Cawthra, on the north side.    I will be back for seconds! (since I couldn't eat my whole meal the first time...)"}
{"text":"I don't know why but I had been CRAVING schnitzel a lot lately and after extensive research I decided to go to this place. I went Sunday night around 8:30pm and it wasn't very packed. It's in an extremely quiet part of town and I must be feeling the Halloween spirit because it kind of spooked me a little. The sign is also not illuminated so I almost missed it.  Getting into the restaurant we saw that we had to seat ourselves since there were no wait staff in sight. My friend and I had sat down for about 10 minutes before the bartender/waitress had given us menus. I felt bad for her as she was the only front of house staff working. The ambiance is very cozy and felt like I was in Europe.  My friend and I ordered the wiener schnitzel ($15.99) with the potato salad (+$1.50) to share (+$1.50). I think it's silly to have to pay $1.50 extra to split an order but it was completely worth it! The schnitzel took some time to cook which was fine because that meant fresh and made to order :D I'm also glad I split the order with my friend because holy the schnitzel was humongous. See picture attached to this review. It was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy breading and tenderness to the meat. The potato salad was super tasty, creamy with the right amount of tang and the potatoes were not overcooked.  Our total bill came to $26.31 with a beer for $6.75. Our wiener schnitzel came up to be $19.56 which is a bit more that what we should have been charged but there was practically no taxes so I am not complaining!  I would definitely come back here again, the waitress was friendly, and the food was amazing. I even had leftovers for two more meals!"}
