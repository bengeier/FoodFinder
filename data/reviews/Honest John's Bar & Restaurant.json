{"text":"This is a great addition to 8th ave in homestead. They were working out some kinks with some previous staff but it seems like things are falling into place for them! I had the fish tacos, and coming from Southern California I'd say these were pretty delicious fish tacos. The coconut flakes and mango were a really nice add on. The folks we were with had the steak which they really enjoyed, the mac'n cheese was also delicious, but very filling, and the CBLT also got 2 thumbs up. They had a decent wine selection, great beers on draft, and I had the manhattan which was fantastic!!  The interior of the place is also really great. It's got a modern feel but it's not super hipster. It fits nicely with the area! Go here for a night out, after shopping at the waterfront, or to watch a game. 

*there could be a few more vegetarian options, which they are working on. If that's your thing, go with the fries. They were awesome!!"}
{"text":"We've held out going here because we are fans of Dorothy 6. Never had a bad meal or bad experience at Dorothy 6.  I wish we would have continued walking a few more storefronts down the road. I wasn't impressed with Honest Johns. They ran out of coffee cream so milk was put in the creamer. Immediately could tell it wasn't cream by the color my coffee turned. I told the waiter I didn't want the coffee but was still charged for it. The bacon was more fat than meat. Had an awful taste. The kicker was the bus boy who's pants were so low(below his ass) all you could see was his yellow underwear. That's not what I want to see when I go out to eat. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Owner takes the time to talk to you and ask if you have any suggestions for improvement, etc. Service was great too."}
{"text":"My only complaint about Honest John's is I wish they were open more. :) 

I've had the brussel spouts and mussels from the appetizer menu. Both were fantastic. I highly recommend the spouts. I can see myself making a meal of them many times over in the future. The mussels were also a stand out with a delicious broth and chunks of jalapeño chicken sausage. Yummy.

From the mains I've had the burger, fish tacos and pastrami sandwich. The burger was perfectly cooked to order. The fish tacos were filled with chunks of blackened tilapia filets, not the breaded strips most other places use. Delicious. The pastrami was good, but it wasn't my favorite honestly. The pickled onions on the sandwich were missing some zing and the pumpernickel bread wasn't thick enough to hold up to all the liquid from the sauce and onions. It was still a tasty sandwich but it quickly became a bit of a mess to eat with one's hands. 

So far I've had the lobster bisque and garden vegetable soups. The bisque came with notably large chunks of lobster and was about the best I've had outside of a coastal region. It was fantastic. The soup offerings rotate, so if it's in the rotation, definitely get it! The vegetable was good. It starts off a little sweet and as you continue to eat a black pepper bite builds on your tongue. I'd have preferred less sweetness but it was still enjoyable with large chunks of veggies, many of which you usually don't see in a typical veggie soup.

They have 2 offering for fries: battered potato and sweet potato. Generally I'm not a fan of the battered fries because they come out soggy/mushy at most places. At John's they've been spot on crunchy every time. But the sweet potato fries are really where it's at. The menu description gave me the impression they'd be cloyingly sweet and I almost didn't get them. Man am I glad I went for it. The fries were perfect and the maple bourbon dipping sauce was phenomenal! I would order them by themselves, they were just that damn good. I found myself continuing to pick at them long after I reached full on food coma bloat. So good.

The staff is great. Friendly and competent, it's the kind of place where if you walk away unhappy, it's your own fault. These people will jump through hoops to satisfy you, all you need do is speak up. On every visit, I've seen the owner and chef, walk through the restaurant checking with customers to make certain they are happy with their food. Seriously, you can't beat that.

I'm a fan...in a big way...and plan to visit this spot frequently. Honest John's is a very welcome addition to Homestead."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. I came here for Sunday brunch on the strength of the reviews and came away disappointed. Honest John is not ready for prime time. The service was slow (and not great), the food was average (we returned one of the entrees we ordered) and what I assume was Honest John (he was wearing a T-shirt with Honest John emblazoned across the front of it) did not come over once to say hello. For a restaurant that's just getting started and trying to get traction) I found that surprising to say the least. I won't be back and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Honest John's twice and I'll be back!  Great energy in the place - friendly waitstaff & owner/manager engaging and welcoming. Good wines by the glass, and good, affordable reds by the bottle which you rarely get in these types of casual spots. Had the short rib quesadillas both times - delish the first time & ordered 2nd time with a special request for a little more heat with fresh jalapeños and they were even better."}
{"text":"Wish I could say that I loved this place, because I really wanted to. Service was slow, and I was really disappointed with my meal. Brussels sprouts were phenomenal, but the pork belly entree did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now and have had a good experience each time. The food has been delicious (especially the short rib quesadillas), the service is attentive and the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant. I appreciate the good selection of wine by the glass. A great place to meet friends for relaxed dining and conversation!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group for a birthday dinner.  I had one of the 2 daily specials with the bread and spreads starter and a good and strong homestead mule.  The food was delicious! Everyone I went with loved their meal. Generous portions plated beautifully at a fair price. The chef's obviously take pride in their work. They told me it took 24 hours to prepare the pork I had on my special! So good!!! The wait staff was friendly and shared a few laughs with our table.  The birthday girl was pleased as punch. Just loved the tasteful, well thought out decor and was especially impressed with hand crafted reclaimed wood table tops. I also liked how the bar is separated from the dining area with windows so you can have a meal with good conversation and still catch the action on the bar side.  Scrabble fans will love the large wall mounted board with magnetic letters by the bar. I plan to go back and play a round, have round and also to try the Eggs Benedict for Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Took mom for a spontaneous dinner. Had heard about Honest Johns recently and thought we'd give it a try.  We both loved it!!  Deviled eggs to die for.: nice touch of horseradish and piled high with dandies bacon, the generous portion could have been a walk in itself.  Combined with a sweet spicy margarita, it was a perfect start!  Mom's burger was meaty, tasty with crispy seasoned fries that were hard to resist.  We will be back.  Go!!  Honestly!!!"}
{"text":"Food was super good!  Hubby and I shared two appetizers, one main dish and a dessert, all were excellent.
The waitress was very good as well.
A cool find! We're happy and will be back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat before a concert at Carnegie Music Hall a few blocks away and came across Honest John's. We just made Happy Hour which was $2 off draft beer. 

We started with the Frites for an app. They were good, I'm a fan of thicker cut fries but the seasonings were good and the dipping sauce went well with it. I had the mussels for my entree, even though it is listed as a starter it was more than enough. The broth was insanely good and I could eat it like soup. My fiance got the burger which he ate faster than I ate 3 mussels. Our waitress was great too, very attentive and wasn't annoyed by my questions about the menu. 

The only downfalls for me was it seemed a bit overpriced and the location is still not the best, even with several new spots opening up near by. We were followed right when we stepped out of the restaurant by someone who wouldn't accept that we didn't have cash on us. He didn't leave us alone until we entered Voodoo a block away. I think it will get better over time and I hope this place can stick it out."}
{"text":"What a comfortable dining experience! Lively atmosphere and a unique creative menu. The was great a friendly and professional staff."}
{"text":"Honest johns has excellent food. The salad particularly was quite good in the dressing was very tasty. They had a ceviche special, and it was excellent. There were five of us in our party and everyone enjoyed his or her meal. I strongly recommend the restaurant. The service was very pleasant, and the restaurant is nicely appointed."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with a large group so I got to see lots of menu items.  Everything out of the kitchen looked amazing. The Reuben was huge and delicious.  The salads looked fresh. I must add that the vegetable soup looked great. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. Outdoor patio looks very inviting.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick brunch. Eggs benedict with short ribs was delicious. Home fries were on the salty side. Service was courteous and fast. The Mimosa was tasty, and everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My family tried Honest John's and we liked it. The ambience was casual but at the same time a nice modern interior, very bright. I liked the magnetic Scrabble board and the fans. The service was a little slow. I got the burger, but I would have liked for the menu to be more diverse. My burger was good. Fries were super good and couldn't stop eating them. Little pricey, but worth it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch and I would happily go back to give dinner a try.  Do you want to pay $11 for brunch and go home hungry?! I certainly do not but unfortunately that was the reality with the 3 slices of French toast I got for my meal for $11.  Note to restaurant: if you want to stay in business you need to add a small side to the brunch entrees-a few pieces of fruit, toast, home fries, something.  The food was so delicious and perfectly presented but left you wanting more.  I love the décor of this place and the staff was very friendly. The service was slow-it took forever for our orders to come out and they brought out 3 out of the 6 orders first then about 10  minutes later the next 3.  Not a great practice.  I really hope they improve upon their brunch as it has great potential."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in up and coming homestead. Fantastic food with excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere. The short rib quesadillas are awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch after shopping in the waterfront. This is homesteads best kept secret. The atmosphere is quaint and modern and the food was stellar. The cream with the mussels needs a spoon for finishing its so good! Don't hesitate to get the \"CBBT\". It's a candied bacon, Brussels sprout and herbed tomato sandwich that took me to another world with my first bite. John, the owner, is very welcoming and hospitable. Definitely will be back, especially with their outdoor seating patio!"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping at the waterfront, I discovered Honest John's nearby and decided to check it out. Homestead is really getting some awesome places to draw in a crowd!

I loved the atmosphere here. Clean, rustic, with an awesome bar. The menu is not overwhelming, but there is certainly something for everyone. I tried the lettuces salad with grilled chicken that was incredible and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and she raved about that as well.  I felt that the food was slightly overpriced ($15 for a salad..) but I enjoyed the experience greatly."}
{"text":"Very good food, kinda higher prices than I was expecting but overall good atmosphere. Cute ambiance and comfortable setting. Glad a friend recommended this place."}
{"text":"the brussel sprouts are amazing! I had the mussel and the were delish. My husband had the chicken pesto sand and he said it was very flavorful. We will be back"}
{"text":"Cute little place for a casual dinner. 

I came in with a fairly large group and we got to order a wide selection of food, which was great. So, I tried a lot of the menu while I was here. 

It's a pretty small place, but there were a lot of people by the bar area when we first got here, so it's definitely a good place to meet up for a drink. 

The service was average; not terrible, not incredible. 

Overall, I'd come back, but I don't think I'd dream about this place at night."}
{"text":"I can't express how badly you need to try this place out. It's a breath of fresh air if you're sick of waterfront chains and want real food. The menu changes everyday and everything is genuine with modern touches. Service is wonderful. Craft cocktails amazing. My favorite part hands down was the owner came over and asked my about my meal and thanked me for coming in. I felt at home. They are sweet peas. You will feel happy inside and out after coming to honest johns. Btw short rib quesadilla was recommended and beyond better than expected."}
{"text":"This place seemed alright, but there were a lot of issues. We went for lunch after hitting up the nearby Escape Room, at around 12:30 on a Saturday. There was no one else there, but it took 35 minutes to get our food, and we all ordered sandwiches. 

Several of my friends ordered the muffuleta sandwich which was served cold, despite the bread being toasted - yes, the bread was cold too. Which makes me suspect they had it in the fridge and warmed it up. 

Another friend ordered the BLT, and they straight up forgot the Bacon. It was just an LT. We complained and they brought us some bacon on the side, but this is not a mistake that should happen when we are the ONLY customers in the place. They still charged us for the BLT, too.

The server was friendly enough, but the food just wasn't that tasty. I ordered the burger, and didn't finish it or the fries, and I normally clean my plate of those two items in particular. The fries were very basic; if someone said they were from the freezer I wouldn't be surprised. To quote a friend \"the Panera Bread version of this sandwich tastes better\".

Not sure at all where all the good reviews came from on this place."}
{"text":"Yea for Homestead! Was actually in my way to another place and Honest John's completely caught my eye. It's bright finish to a dim 8th ave is just what this street needs. The decor is simple and clean. Love the bar area and there is outdoor seating! Yes, outdoor seating!!! Can't wait to see that once the cold winter goes. 

I started with the Blue Steel which is a simple vodka martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Comes in a metal martini glass which is a nice touch. The olives are not your store bought, pre-stuffed. Hand stuffed which makes the cheese a nice treat. So many different drinks on the menu to try...large selection of Mules, beers, wine and cocktail specials. 

My friend and I chose the breads and spreads 5 choice option. Loved the roasted black garlic. It is pungent, but great. We also had the tapenade, bone marrow butter, goat cheese and anchovy caper. Served with a selection of toasted pita chips, focaccia and raisin bread. Excellent!

I chose the appetizer serving of the mussels. Thank goodness because the entree would have been way too much after the breads.  Sooo good. Topped with chicken sausage and sweet peppers and cubed focaccia. The broth was tasty! My friend had the wings and I tried a bite. Great sauce and sizable half pound portion. 

The owner, \"Honest John\" was there to chat with us     I'm looking forward to returning to try more on the menu and see the happy hour specials. 

Honestly...great."}
{"text":"Update: The mark of a great restaurant is an owner who cares. I received a message shortly after the review below confirming that sides will be added to orders, and a changing table will be installed. Way to go, Honest John!

Honest John's interior decorator deserves 5 stars. Love, love, the décor. The brunch menu, while not incredibly big, is also solid. I order the DIY Omelette with almost every \"topping\" option. A few of the items I chose were missing, but it took a decent amount of time to receive our food, and I was starving, so I ate it anyway. It was delicious! I expected it to come with toast or something, but it was just an omelette on a plate. For $11, that's borderline too expensive for just an omelette IMO. I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...

While our server was pleasant enough, service was slow. Granted, we had a party of six, but the party of three beside us also seemed to experience excessive wait times as well.

In my 3 short months as a parent this is the first restaurant I've encountered without a changing table. Even though it's been only 3 months, we go out a LOT, so it's interesting that this is the first time this has happened. I sort of just stood there, and after a bit of thought, decided to use my portable changing pad on the entryway bench. Sorry 'bout that, but I didn't want to do it at the table, and wasn't sure what else I could do. Unfortunately, I think this means I won't be dining at HJ's until my baby Yelper is out of diapers, or I fly solo. All things considered about the experience, it's probably going to be the former to give them a bit more time to work out what's sure to be a great restaurant someday!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the courtesy of the staff and the atmosphere at Honest Johns.  We stopped here on a Sunday after eating brunch elsewhere to get a drink and check it out.  They close at 3:00 on Sundays and we didn't arrive until about 2:30.  Now lots of places would be a little annoyed at our late appearance or just inform us that we can only get drinks cause they close at 3, but no the bartender warmly asked if we were doing brunch, drinks, or both.  That was very nice not getting a stink eye for the late arrival.  

We settled on some drinks and soaked in the atmosphere which was lovely done with a very modern and contemporary feel.  Everything looked new and clean and we noticed an outdoor area in the back which would be perfect for the warmer months.  We did ask for a menu just see what they offered and were quite pleased at the selection making note that we should return for a true dining experience.   

I ordered an Irish coffee and true to my experience with Irish coffee's she made it with Jamison and Baileys and even asked if I wanted the whipped cream.  Take notice, I am not a bartender having only played one on TV, but this is how an Irish coffee is done.  It was the perfect warm boozy blend I needed for this particularly cold Sunday.  

We didn't wrap up until after 3, and they were not rushing us out the door.  Very nice staff, love the atmosphere, and my drink hit the spot.  I hope to eat here soon so I can write a food review, but if the food is as good as the rest it will be a winner."}
{"text":"Honest John's is definitely the best place to eat in the Waterfront area; the food quality and value for your money is excellent. The décor is welcoming, there is an outdoor patio and the tables are well spaced out which is fairly rare in Pittsburgh. It also isn't crazy loud so you an have a conversation.

The menu is small but there is a little bit of everything and the portions are a little bit larger than standard. I really liked the breads and spreads tray but wish they had maybe more of a variety of breads. We have also tried: 
ceviche - very good
mussels/sausage app - this could be a meal in itself, great broth
pastrami - great ingredients/bread
sweet potato fries - these were perfect, crisp and came with a delicious dipping sauce

Server was great, there was a bit of a wait for the food but I think their kitchen is really small so that can't really be helped. She kept us informed of the delay and the owner was there both times keeping an eye on things. Most dinner items are in the $12-$15 range with a few outliers so I would say this is the price range of TGI Fridays/Rock Bottom. 

Anyway, I will likely be a repeat customer and really enjoyed my experience so check them out if you are looking for a meal in the Waterfront or Homestead area."}
{"text":"A bit surprised to find this well lit, good atmosphere place on 8th ave in Homestead. Live music tonight and had the feel of a pub.  However Appetizers shared were definitely not pub type; very good but would pass on calamari next time.  Short rib quesadilla and deviled eggs are must haves.   Noise level inside was too much for conversation but finding a place on outdoor patio solved noise issue."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks a few times and have never been disappointed. Their appetizers are also quite good- I tried their fries, brussels, and chicken tenders and loved them all. The staff here is wonderful and so friendly. I'm looking forward to coming here for brunch or dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Our pastrami sandwiches and appetizers were very good. Looking forward to going back to try other things on the menus. We had the best server. I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Definitely going to tell friends and family to try Honest Johns."}
{"text":"The first time we visited Honest John's we were 
 blown away by the amazing food and the ability to actually chat with \"John\". Because the first time was so amazing...... The second time we visited we brought our family (8 people) . We didn't have reservations and it was packed. We tried to make other arrangements elsewhere but John stopped us and ensured that he would make it work. And lucky for us it did. We noticed they brought in tables from outside to make it work. We had an amazing meal despite it being packed and we all decided we would be back again."}
{"text":"It never disappoints.  John always makes us feel so welcome.   Fresh delicious drinks - we had the blood orange margaritas last and and for dinner I had the ricotta ravioli with mascarpone, mint and lemon with sweet peas and crispy prosciutto - I ate every bite - they were that good.  My husband had the mussels (best in town, hands down, we get them EVERY time - ask for a spoon.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you end up somewhere that you weren't planning on going and are so glad you did.  I was not aware of Honest John's until my friend and I parked right in front of it.  Always wanting to support Homestead businesses we decided to go in and have a drink and check it out.  And ended up staying for dinner!

Very cool layout and decor.  The sleek bar is in the center of the establishment, with a dining room to your left, and another dining area past the bar in the main area.  And, when the weather finally breaks, they have a great little patio for dining outdoors.

Nice selection of specialty cocktails along with several Moscow Mules.  I had \"The Homestead\" which was perfect for a cool night, a great mix of whiskey, ginger beer and an orange.

My friend and I could not help but to choose the breads and spreads plate where you can pick either three or five different cheese/spreads which is accompanied with several different breads.  My favorite was the goat cheese, which actually went pretty well with the garlic spread.  It can't hurt to mix things up a little!

For my meal I chose a half pound of wings with the BBQ sauce.  A half pound ends up being about 6 full sized wings.  The sauce, while plentiful (and messy), was really good!  You'll need several napkins for this, but certainly worth the sticky fingers.

My friend ordered the appetizer portion of the muscles, and it was definitely a large portion that served as a dinner portion.  

The owner, John, was at the bar area and introduced himself to us.  He talked about the menu and ideas for happy hour specials.  The staff was all very attentive and friendly.  Honest John's is a fantastic addition to 8th Avenue and I can wait to bring my brunch club here for....drum roll please...brunch!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty good when they opened, they had a lot of good dishes that they since took off the menu. Service was always just meh, seems more like a bar hangout for the owners friends. Food quality steadily nose dived over the past 6 months. We got served severely undercooked fried calamari with a side of puréed banana peppers, really, really gross. Got a bad Reuben, I think the corned beef was straight from shop n save deli. the owner/manager needs to get it together."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with some friends and had their mahi mahi tacos- they were delicious! My friends said their dishes were great too. Super impressed with the food and service and would recommend/go back!"}
{"text":"I gotta give this place props for plopping down in the middle of Homestead and making a go of it.  They have a lot of potential and I really hope they make it.   For starters, the space is really pretty.  They did a great job with the décor, which is a modern rustic theme.  Happy hour specials were pretty broad - something for everyone.  We ate at the bar and everyone there was super friendly and they all looked to get along very well.   

The food was good, but not spectacular - a solid base to start with though.  We sampled the breads and spreads.  I really liked some of it and didn't love some of it. The black garlic was a lot more bitter than I'd anticipated and the raisin bread was sort of stale, but there was a goat cheese spread and a sweet potato spread that I could have eaten a vat of.   My entre was the short rib quesadilla.  Again, it was good and I enjoyed it, but it seemed like it was missing something.  A few tweaks and the food could really be great and I think they'll get it right once they have some more regular clientele and a little more rhythm.  On the night I went, the place was fairly empty except for a big group of the owner's family."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with four others and was seated right away.  Nice menu and atmosphere.  The Reuben was very good and two others had BLTs that they liked very much.  It wasn't busy during lunch and the five of us talked and laughed for another 45 minutes after eating and didn't feel pressured to be on our way."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Stopped here when we saw that Studio AM was closed. So glad we did!!!!!!
It is a warm and friendly atmosphere with a really cool scrabble board on the wall - like a really big one that is magnetic. It's cool. Trust me. 
We sat in the back room with exposed brick wall and great warm lighting with Edison lights. It was rustic and industrial that complete works.  The spot was intimate for our meal. Plenty of space in the dinning area helps you feel comfortable   
The food was simply amazing. 
I recommend deviled eggs and my partner loved his pimento Mac m cheese.  The drinks were well made and formidable.  We saved room for dessert. The spice cake was transcendent. Go for it!!!
We will come back again and wanna try their brunch."}
{"text":"Good outdoor patio for summer. Friendly staff. Gluten free options. Wings were very good. Overall would go back. Fresh atmosphere."}
{"text":"Honest John's is the kind of restaurant that you want to root for. It services an area of Pittsburgh that for years has been lacking in fine dining options, and you can tell that the owner is passionate, hardworking, and determined that his guests have a great experience. The food is top notch and the drinks are also reasonably priced and delicious. The mussels are a must, my Girlfriend got a to go container just for the cream sauce that accompanied them. I got the Honest John burger which was Fantastic, the shoestring fries were also very good. My Gf had the ricotta ravioli' and she said they were amazing. The service started off a little lackadaisical, however, got better as the experience drew on. All in all, I would highly recommend Honest Johns, it's definitely a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Did I expect to see cloth napkins at a place called Honest John's Bar? Absolutely not! 

The menu was unlike anything I expected either.  Simplified,  yet very unique.  Be sure to check out their homemade desserts and gelato. 

I was warmly greeted at the door.  There is bar and table seating, or a large, separate dining section. Each area is appealing and inviting. Definitely not at all what I expected based on the name and location. 

Honestly,  Honest John's is a great place to stop for a comfortable night out, and quality food."}
{"text":"Nestled in Homestead, this place is a hidden gem. Ambience is casual,  food eclectic but very good. Service good as well."}
{"text":"Wayyyy over priced for lunch. $11.00 for a ruben and it was jus so so. Harvey's is 100 times better for $7.95. Guess honest John is not so honest."}
{"text":"Very new and trendy. We went for lunch but would be better as a dinner place. The menu was very creative but both of the things we got (chicken sandwich and the burger) were both very good. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch there on Wednesday. It started with a great greeting from the bartender.. My new favorite drink is the fresh thyme iced tea.  There was enough drafts to keep anyone Happy. The menu was interesting & informative.. The food was great, The crispy calamari with banana pepper vinigrete was very enjoyable. Shrimp po boy sand was a taste of new Orleans and the seasoned fries were to die for.. The frisse, egg & pork belly was a great dish also.  I can't wait to return to the best restaurant in the waterfront."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good Manhattan!

Fantastic addition to the Homestead main drag!

Looking forward to go back soon.

I had the brussels sprouts and short rib quesadilla which was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere. We got seated pretty quickly and the service was average. I got beef sugo and it was really flavorful! Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals that I was with. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Found this spot based on other yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. I shared the mussels as an app with my husband and then got the baby lettuce salad with shrimp and my husband got the mahi mahi tacos. Everything was delicious! I think the best part for me was the sauce that the mussels were served in. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and atmosphere close to the Waterfront and so much better than the chain restaurants in the vicinity. The staff was very friendly and we had the fish tacos, Moroccan chicken stew, and CBBT sandwich, all of which was delicious."}
{"text":"Honest John's has by far the BEST food in Pitt! I'm from the DC Area where there r tons of places with amazing food but this is by far the best food! not to mention the staff is very welcoming and the owner John is very friendly! Me and my bf had the pork belly and hush puppies! #AMAZING  if you're ever in town you MUST come check it out!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant to hear the live music, which was delightful. For dinner ?I ordered the fish tacos, which have a surprisingly? complex combination of flavors. I really wanted to eat the third one but was stuffed and got to enjoy it for lunch the next day. If I had? gotten the fries instead of the salad, I might have only been able to eat one taco. The dressing was average but more than made up for by the tacos. My friend had the Caesar salad and was disappointed it didn't have real anchovies, but I think few people like them, so they are rarely offered. The owner was helping with service and very nice."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me so long to try a place that is so close to my home.  Great look and feel inside.  A little echoey on the bar side / but I'm sure it's more quiet on the restaurant side.  Wait staff helped with our selections which started with the deviled eggs. They were great. 6 to an order and had a great taste with just the slightest kick to them.  The bacon on them was wonderful.  I had the ricotta dumplings.  First time I've ever had them and will definitely order them again.  Not too buttery but enough to coat the mushrooms and spinach.  Didn't look like a lot but looks are deceiving.  Husband tried the grilled cheese with prosciutto.  He's a pretty basic eater so I was pleasantly surprised when he ate everything after being so nervous about a date and white truffle being on the sandwich. He really liked it.  Ordered the salted caramel custard for dessert.  OMG it was amazing.  The syrup was like sweet spicy heaven.  Can't wait to go back with friends to share more of the menu like the Brussel sprouts and calamari.  I get the feeling theirs are going to be exceptional.  We'll be back


Had brunch today.  Not crowded at all at 11:30am.  Eggs Benedict with short ribs were great.  Absolutely perfect.  Potatoes could've been cooked a little longer.  My friend had the basic two egg breakfast.  Bacon was thin but tasty.  Odd that she only got one slice of basic really thin wheat toast (isn't two slices the norm?)  All in all, it was good.  BTW - still really echoey on the restaurant side.  If it were crowded it would probably really hard to talk without screaming at eachother."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. The staff was welcoming and friendly.

My wife and I had brunch on a Sunday.
The Homestead Stack was a generous portion of pancakes bacon and berries. Topped off with powdered sugar. Very good....

My wife had the Eggs Benedict which she thoroughly enjoyed as well.

We will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. We met John the owner. Fantastic food, chill atmosphere and great service.  I highly recommend the CBBT. Candied Bacon, Brussel sprout, and Tomato sandwich. It's on ciabatta bread and comes with frites and a garlic parm aioli. One of the best sandwiches I've had in Pittsburgh! My husband had the mussels. They were fresh, well cooked and in a delicious sauce. I wish we had more time to experience the homemade ice cream and gelato. However, it's the prefect excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch! The french onion soup was fantastic and we really enjoyed the  California BLT w/ grilled salmon, bacon, lettuce, tomato & avocado. Can't wait to stop by during happy hour! Great new place, really nice atmosphere, the owner & wait staff/bartender were super friendly!"}
{"text":"If you don't feel like the chain restaurant parade available at the waterfront, Honest John's is a good spot to grab a drink and some good eats.

Their bloody marys are on point with fresh horseradish just the way I like it. Their sandwiches were decent sized and pretty darn good. I'm a firm believer in judging a place on their fish tacos (if they have it on the menu) and Honest John's makes a pretty darn good Fish Taco.

If anything, go here for their fries and a drink. Their fries are the crunchy fantastic arby's-ish style amazing fantastic wow wow fries. You know, the kind you daydream about.

All in all, a clean and spacious restaurant that yells have brunch here and drink my drinks."}
{"text":"Definitely more than worth trying this hip place out. Highly recommend the Short Rib Quesidilla. Not to mention the fish special n Chicken n Dumplings. The staff is phenomenal and the \"Mules\" are top notch. A new fav for sure, planning to share with my work colleague when he's in town in April. Yes, this place is that good!"}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was yummy.  Burger super tasty!  The only complaint was we wanted the spare rib quesadillas and they were out of spare rib meat.  I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"First time the Yelp rating didn't match my experience.  Appetizer (short rib quesadilla) and shrimp bisque soup was very good.  Server was nice but slow despite the small crowd.  Outside seating was noisy due to some pipe emitting a sound that made 3 tables move.  Medium burger was overdone and dry.   Small changes could make this place a better experience."}
{"text":"I've seen this place driving by many times,  finally got a chance to check them out. Everything from the service to the food to the drinks were fantastic. 

We had a few appetizers and shared an entree. Tried the frites, the grilled asparagus,  and shared the chicken with quinoa. Every thing was well prepared, great flavor combinations. We finished it off with the chocolate mousse/passion fruit dessert.

The server, Kat, rocked. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tasty contemporary food in a nice setting. Staff was very pleasant. They had fish specials for Lent and a couple of good vegetarian options on the regular menu. Entrences had ramps for accessibility. There is a bar area with TV if you want to watch the game, or a couple of more quiet rooms."}
{"text":"When this place opened I had extremely high hopes. The food WAS great! I have since been back several times and found each experience was worse than the last. All of the great menu options we loved have been removed from the menu. I previously had uploaded photos of delicious meals we had at honest johns, none of which are still offered. We have since been very disappointed with uncooked meals, odd flavor/spice additions to meals that do not blend, and poor service. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall type restaurant.  Had the pork chop and it was absolutely amazing.  Great food altogether.  Server was very nice as well.  Definitely a do over"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're looking for some amazing food for a great price, then this is where you should come. The speciality drinks are delicious and the staff is very friendly. Recommended great date night spot. 
Just minutes from the waterfront for you to stop by after shopping to have a drink or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Nice new space with a large scrabble board on the front wall.  The bar room is long with dark gray walls and there is a side dining area.   
The staff was friendly and helpful.
We shared a bowl of homemade split pea soup that was thick and very tasty...seemed to have some onion and carrot in it along with a spice that we could not identify.  
I had the Crab Cake sandwich which was the special of the day.  A good sized tasty crab cake.
There is Happy Hour weeknights and Wine Wednesdays.  I think the wine prices are always the same (according to the list I saw) so not sure what you get for Happy Hour or Wine Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This place is a gem hidden away. Not what I expected at all but was probably my favorite place I ate at in Pittsburgh. The neighborhood is still trying to turn the corner but don't let that stop you. I came in for lunch and was blown away. It's an older building so the seating is kind of odd but let's skip that. The cocktails were as solid as can be. I had a Jalepeno margarita and then switched to a bourbon cocktail and they were both perfect. We had the quesidilla for a starter and it was really savory! Nice starer portion and the flavor profile was perfect. The server was awesome And told us a little bit about the place. Made a great cocktail also so server /bartender! We Also tried the deviled eggs. Now I'm not a big fan if deviled eggs but I ate a couple so if you like deviled eggs give them a try.  The main lunch course did not disappoint and the flavors we're again excellent with good portions. This is a place you have to try if you are anywhere close it adventurous enough to go out and find it. The movies are close, so is Costco, Dave and Buster's and other shopping so make it an afternoon!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant after a day where everything was going wrong, so I admit, I was vulnerable and needed my food to hug my soul. I had never seen or heard of this place but the name greeted me with the warmth I needed, so I went inside. I was greeted by friendly staff and took a seat at the bar. 

The bartender took my drink order and gave me a menu. I was in the mood for something healthy and protein packed. I started with the horseradish deviled eggs with candied bacon and chives. Holy hot damn, these were very literally the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten. Trust me when I say this is not hyperbole. The balance of sweet and savory with the added bite from the horseradish was like a divine trinity in my mouth. 

For my main dish, I ordered the baby lettuces salad. Get this, it had baby lettuces, (of course) a dijon-balsamic vinaigrette, bruleed goat cheese, dried apricots, candied pecans, and was topped with grilled chicken. In case you don't know, let me explain what bruleed goat cheese is. Its a creamy round of goat cheese with a toasted, carmelized shell. If you are new to bruleed goat cheese, like I was, imagine if baby Jesus, the Dalai Lama, a unicorn, and Betty White got together to formulate the best way to eat a round of goat cheese. That's what this tasted like. Pure, Zen, magical truth that never goes out of style. Naturally, everything else on the salad was pretty much gravy. Not literally people. There was no gravy on the salad. Just perfectly balanced flavors, and a dressing to bring it home. 

The bartender was super down to earth and friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Learned about this place from a \"Neighborhood Spotlight\" email from yelp and I'm so glad I opened the email! Love the decor and atmosphere of this place. While dining, Honest John himself stoped by to check on us and make sure everything was good. He's very passionate about the restaurant. I had the crab bisque and a Cobb salad while my guest had blackened shrimp pasta. Everything was excellent, but her pasta was exceptional! Fresh pasta, with the perfect amount of sauce. I will definitely be going back to this restaurant in the not so distant future!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group for brunch.

The waitstaff was friendly, but couldn't handle the amount of people in our group. We usually celebrate birthdays at local restaurants, and wanted to try something new. 

Unfortunately, once our food arrived it was barely warm, and everyone that had potatoes noticed that they were severely over salted. So we advised them of this, and they advised there were no more potatoes, so they replaced them all with fries (which was awesome). The food in general was just okay. Their bloody marys are really good though. 

I would give this place another shot, but I will never come in a group again. I also wouldn't recommend anyone to come with a group..."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal at Honest John's. The service was wonderful, I had the Lobster Bisque, DELICIOUS!! Also had the Reuben and fries generous portions attentive wait staff GREAT EXPERIENCE!! TRY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some food and a few drinks.  Loved the atmosphere. Friendly staff.  Good service.  Can't wait to go back.  We love arsenal cider so it was an added bonus to see it in tap here."}
{"text":"Just to be honest with you...  Honest John's is looking like it's going to be a very nice bar/restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  The wife and I were having brunch a few doors down but heard about this place and wanted to have a few drinks to see if we would like to come back for brunch or dinner another day.

 When we walked in it was about 230pm and they close on Sundays at 3.  A lot of times you get an evil eye when you walk into a restaurant right before they are closing but they didn't here.  The bartender was nice and asked if we wanted brunch or just drinks and we told her just drinks.  
 
     Looking around you can see that the restaurant looks very nice and still new looking.  We liked the colors of the floors and the bar area was very appealing.

     So we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks.  Carrie got Irish coffee that was really good.  They put Baileys and Jameson in it just the way she likes it.  I just got a Sam Adams Cold Snap.

     Looking around we saw that they have a nice patio outside.  It was too cold to check it out but it's something that we would like to come back and try in the summer.  

     Another couple came in about 15 minutes before they closed and they were able to get brunch still which was nice to see.  We both were here past 3 and the bartender told us to take our time and we did LoL.  We had a nice time there and we got to check out heir dinner/brunch menu too.  We both had another drink and just had a good time here
 
     This place is definitely a place you need to check out to be honest with you!  We got really good service, I's a nice atmosphere, and I'm looking forward to try their food in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  Great food!   Great service!  Great atmosphere!  We had a party of 15 and had the best service.  The CBBT sandwich is highly recommended.  The deviled eggs were awesome.  Really everyone enjoyed our meals!!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check it out; the reviews are definitely dead on it's fantastic. 

INCREDIBLY kind and attentive staff, and they take an actual interest in how you like the food. 

Super clean bar, nice patio, great atmosphere. 

We had the candied bacon avocado BLT, nice spin on the classic, the candied bacon was fantastic; and the ricotta dumplings, which are this perfect combination of crisp and airy, feels like you're biting into a mildly cheesy cloud. 

Not the biggest draft beer selection but that's fine, the mules and cocktail selection makes up for it in my mind. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"For those of you familiar with the area, this restaurant is in the same location where Tin Front Cafe used to be.  The restaurant is not affiliated with Tin Front Cafe, and has a totally different vibe.  It is much bigger than Tin Front because it also incorporates the store that used to be next door. They still have the great outdoor area which will be awesome in the warmer months.
One of the first things that stood out was that this restaurant/bar is partitioned into three rooms.  Upon entering the two rooms separate from the bar, you could tell a substantial decrease in the noise level from the bar and TVs.  It was a classy and dimly lit, allowing for a much more intimate setting.  On today's visit, I stayed at the bar.  

Their menu is not your typical bar fare.  I got some wings and a burger, which sounds typical enough, but my wings were habanero orange - a nice blend of heat (but not too much) and citrus sweetness. They also were not your typical breaded wings.  They were fried without a coating, which led to a very crispy skin.  My burger (which I ordered medium) was cooked properly, and was a nice thick, juicy chuck patty.  It was topped with friend onions, a tomato compote, mixed greens and cheddar cheese. Very tasty.  The fries that came with it were also great.  Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

The drinks are what stood out the most.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap - I think that there were 7 or eight - but the ones that they did have were solid options.  But where their drinks are different is in the large selection of cocktails, mules, and wines.  I had a Homestead Mule consisting of whisky, ginger beer and an orange slice.  Very refreshing, tasty, and served in an ice cold copper mule mug.

On top of that, service was great - extremely friendly staff and owner, who came by to chat and introduce himself.

This is definitely a solid addition to the growing Homestead bar/restaurant scene, and one that has its own distinct identity among them.  If you are looking for a place with a huge number of draft beers on tap, then this is probably not your best bet in Homestead.  I would try either Dukes, Blue Dust or Dorothy 6.  But if you are more of a foodie looking for an upscale bar, that can also provide an intimate dining experience with a lot of drink options - Honest John's is a great choice.  Definitely work checking out, especially if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant.  The seasonal menu options are always delicious with some staple items.   Plus I can never eat here with getting their desserts, they are delicious and worth the calories.  If you looking for some scrumptious food and great cocktails this is the place.

Also John and the staff are fantastic.  Everyone is friendly and genuine, this is the heart of a great restaurant."}
