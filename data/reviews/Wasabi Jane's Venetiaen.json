{"text":"Worst sushi I ever tasted.  Will never go back.  The egg plant was green and undercooked.  My mistake for ordering it before it sat and cooked all day.  $16 for those two items and a bottled tea.  Guess I shouldn't complain when my wife paid $25 for a burger and fries next door.  Some Vegas places just want to make sure they never get repeat business."}
{"text":"search Wasabi Jane's rice and noodle works for more reviews."}
{"text":"Sold spoiled food. Went to Venetian and ordered at wasabi Jane 2 combo plate.  Fried rice spoiled. Worker refused to acknowledged and did not even offered to replaced food. Very poor customers service . Did not even apologize . Need to report to the health district ."}
{"text":"Wow, all I can say is I spent the entire night and next morning hugging the toilet and sick in my hotel room. Both ends! It was not my way to spend my vacation ;("}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am an Asian (Japanese) senior citizen.  A business that calls itself \"Wasabi Janes\" should serve better wasabi.  What I had tasted like horse radish with green food coloring.  The sushi was decent but would have been much better if it had not been cold.  It is prepared ahead and kept cold.    The teriyaki chicken was excellent and the fried tofu and rice noodles were good.    Service was good both times I ate there,  The food was fresh.  Common seating was plentiful in the food court (during the week)."}
{"text":"Had a very good tuna poke bowl.  You get to pick what vegetables, rice, and sauce you want.  Pay the extra 50 cents for the seaweed salad -- it's quite good.  Employees were quick and helpful.  Price is excellent."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really recommend this place in the Venetian Food Court. If I were you, and in the mood for  reasonably priced Chinese, I'd head to the Panda Express opposite.   Wasabi Jane's fried rice was hard, the salmon was over done, egg drop soup was cold, the broccoli was soft... Even when I asked for an extra plate, they gave me a miniature paper saucer!   I was not amused."}
{"text":"This was just an OK experience.  The food trays on display weren't full.  The food came out hot though.  This is more like a food court type of restaurant and there are many other menu selections from the adjoining restaurants.  The food court itself was pretty clean with ample seating.  The staff at Wasabi Janes were courteous, poite and prompt."}
{"text":"They sell Pho but the image they have on display is different than what they serve. I'm intolerant to chili and no where did it say topped with jalapenos. I asked the woman if it had chili in it since I read online that some pho has crushed chili in it, depending on the region. I was told I would be fine. Thank goodness my aunt ate the rest so I didn't waste $12."}
