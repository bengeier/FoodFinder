{"text":"I've ordered from this place twice in a month, which isn't something I do frequently- Madison has an exceptional selection of great food. But as soon as I saw their menu sitting on my counter from the previous order, I thought to myself; \"was I just really hungry, or was the high roller burrito amazing? Maybe I should try again to be sure.\"

Yep. Amazing the second time. Lost a star, though, because I paid for two small glass bottles of coke, and they only delivered one."}
{"text":"I am glad you exist Burrito Drive. You fill a much needed space in the food service here. LATE night and hang over food. Thank you for the hungry hippy. Also the Breakfast Burrito is so so so delicious, excellent addition. 

XX This is not a sit down, bring your family Mexican restaurant if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Never attempt sober...Had to ask for a fork and it looked wayyy dirty yo!"}
{"text":"Stoner heaven! There's nothing else you can call a place that delivers burritos, stays open to 3 am, and sits next to Bongo Video. But no matter what your frame of mind, this place is the bomb. I'm so glad they're on my way home from work, so I can swing by and pick up a burrito if I'm leaving late and don't feel like making dinner. Whatever you order, make sure it includes the sweet potato puree - like pureed gold."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Mexican food? Then this is the place... that you should not order from.  But! I still love Burrito Drive because it is fast and easy.  Usually I just create my own burrito, but if you're feeling sleezy, you can always try the White Trash Burrito, which features American delicacies such as Spam and Velveeta."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer of this place for more than 2 years. The burritos they serve are unique, delicious, and filling. You get what you pay for when you eat here; I usually don't finish my burrito!"}
{"text":"I was hungry, it was filling and I ate it.  Built my own tacos, chose the pork, also added beans & guacamole.  Overall flavorless, some spice but the cheese was barely melted and I've made better guacamole with avocado & salsa than what was on there.  Small selection compared to a real Mexican place, no taquitos or chile relleno, or even a boring old taco salad.  Pickled onions reminded me of the south if the border plate at the Weary.  Overall I'm not impressed and for the prices, won't order again unless someone else pays."}
{"text":"Good late night foods. Inventive burritos, OK execution. Could use better tortillas and some better ingredients. Open very late, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I have been on a burrito bonanza as of late, and Burrito Drive is everything I want and more. It's a small, little location that can easily be overlooked by the great offerings of Willy Street, but this establishment doesn't need to please aesthetically. The food speaks for itself.

My go-to: the Sheh-meh-neh Burrito. At first, I was skeptical that sweet potato puree in a burrito would be a good idea, but I am now the biggest fan. The queso fresco and pickled veggies make this an odd-sounding burrito, but it's what you never knew you wanted Combine all that with the salsa, and I'm always happy.

I would say that Burrito Drive has the best burritos in Madison. If you're ever in the area and want a casual meal, or if you're thinking of a night in, this is the place for you.

Side note: All the burritos are good if you're not feeling that adventurous."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos! We had the white trash and the high roller. Excellent! Tell me another place that you can get a burrito delivered to your house, none! We ordered online which was easy and they were surprisingly fast delivering it. Tired of pizza and the usual delivered stuff....order some burritos!"}
{"text":"We've gotten food from here before and it's usually decent but tonight our burritos were cold. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"the menu is a little off-putting. strange ingredients, and an even stranger marriage of them. and the prices seem a little high. so why 4 stars? because it's fresh, it's delivery, and it tastes really good (i tend not to give out 5 stars, unless something is superb).

we ordered last night; me, the non-endangered fish tacos, and my dining companion, the carnita tacos. after one bite, he exclaimed that he could eat them every day forever. they came with a red salsa that tasted very fresh and mild. my fish tacos weren't on par with tex tubb's (or my own), but i thought they were good enough. they came with a green salsa that was just as fresh-tasting, but had a heavy cilantro flavor (i only mention this because there are two camps when it comes to cilantro).

corn tortilla lovers will start out feeling disappointed, but you'll really enjoy these tacos on flour, i swear!"}
{"text":"We order from here quite a bit, and the food is excellent, and the service is excellent, and the delivery is quick. However, I do feel like they need to more of the main ingredients, i.e. meat and fish and chicken and pork, into their burritos and tacos. Way too much rice in there. Hardly any of the other main ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is great, WHEN THEY GET IT RIGHT.  But I swear, they screw up our order every time.  I don't think I'll be ordering from them again...it has happened far too many times."}
{"text":"Well... it was nourishment. That much can be said.

But it went downhill from there.

To start, we waited 20 minutes for an appetizer and 2 burritos and the place was decidedly not busy. While we were waiting, something went wrong in the kitchen and the dining area filled with smoke. No attempt to clear the air was ever made by the staff. Simply opening the front door would have helped a ton. This never occurred to the girl who took our order.

Second, 20 minutes? For two burritos? OK. Fine. Whatever... then why didn't the appetizer come out BEFORE the entrees? That's what an appetizer is for. We were hungry when we showed up and starving by the time the appetizer came along with the rest of the meal. You might as well not have brought it at all.

Third, I get the impression that the people working here have only read about this cuisine. It isn't that hard to get right. I'd even go so far as to say it is hard to get wrong. But get it wrong they did. The eliotes or, as they called it, \"mexican street corn\" came out looking like pig slop. Really. It was three cobs of corn thrown on a plate with some shredded cheddar cheese (NOT cotija like the menu says) and bacon tossed around. This is so far off from the real thing that I guess the book they read about all this stuff didn't have pictures. The steak in my burrito wasn't separated. At all. It was chopped up, but no attempt was made to actually separate the meat into separate pieces. So on the first bite about half of the meat of the entire burrito came with it. The salsa (pico de gallo in my case) was incredibly bland. No lime, no cilantro or any other form of seasoning, pretty much just tomato. 

In the end, we did get some nourishment. I suppose. I guess this is the outcome when you let some all-snark-no-skill hipsters run a burrito joint."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Burrito Drive a few times out of drunken desperation and today we ordered sober for the first time. It was delivery for me to have a tasty lunch at work. Two words: Never. Again. We ordered the sheh-meh-neh burrito and Enchiladas. The first not so obvious issue was the addition of shrimp to our enchilada. This might be an excellent bonus if I weren't deathly allergic to shrimp. My throat nearly shut off completely. Thanks guys. Secondly, the sauce on the enchilada smelled and tasted like marina pasta sauce. Just stick to what you know best, guys. Mediocre, soggy, non-fresh tasteless burritos. I have a suspicion the burritos are prepared days if not weeks in advanced and then microwaved. Just DRIVE RIGHT PAST BURRITO DRIVE & spare your wallet and health..."}
{"text":"Because I have frequent late-night food cravings (especially after several hours of heavy drinking, which is not an uncommon occurrence for me) and love a good burrito, I have now visited Burrito Drive four times since moving to Madison less than a month ago. The major pro of this place is that it's open until 3 a.m., making it the perfect place to go after last call when you need some protein in your stomach to soak up all the excess alcohol. The major con, unfortunately, is the food. Although the unique, off-the-wall combinations of ingredients were an initial source of enticement, every burrito I've ordered has been extremely bland--just no flavor whatsoever. And considering that one Google reviewer actually described his meal as \"a spiritual experience,\" I was more than a little let down to find burrito after burrito underseasoned and underwhelming (especially considering the prices). That being said, I do appreciate that they are open so late, and I've never experienced anything but excellent service. And this place must have something going for it if I keep coming back (albeit in an intoxicated state most of the time). A solid three stars."}
{"text":"We really like Burrito Drive.  The fact that they are willing to deliver late at night is also a plus. I had the house Chimichanga.  It was absolutely delicious. It was so filling I could only eat half of it and saved the other half for lunch the next day.  My hubby had the tacos.  He said they were really good.  The downside was that all 3 tacos had to be the same meat selection.  it would be nice if he could have tried out 3 different tacos.  The rice and beans were just okay.  A little bland and dry.  Overall, for the price, convenience, customer service and short amount of time it took to get our food, this place is pretty good.  I have ordered from here several times and I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"One of the only delivery places in downtown Madison that's open late night.
Perfect for when I'm out with my friends and the line for Jins Chicken is too long and even better for a lazy night in.
The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty incredible.
Count me in anytime for Burrito Drive"}
{"text":"So bad!! I had the yuckiest sweet potato quesadilla. Couldn't eat more than two bites. I won't give it another try."}
{"text":"My go to late night. Consistent good food to end my night and set my day straight. By consistent I mean you could go much cheaper and much crappier for a couple dollars less. Make sure you know what you want. Grab a bunch and go family style. A little of everything for everybody. Splurge and avoid the drive thru. You'll find something you like. Served late night  in person or delivery. Hands down best food at this time of night. Consistent food til 3 am. You can do way worse. BD will keep the hangover away! Trust me :)"}
{"text":"Delivery dude was cute, despite terrible queso I give this spot a thumbs up! Plus one the sweet potato"}
{"text":"I just noticed this was so highly rated and wanted to send a little more reality the way of the burrito drive. The only thing it has going for it is the fact it delivers, and would pass for a business meeting or simple catered event. If you are looking to go out to enjoy some Mexican food-you can look pretty much anywhere else and be happier.  

I've tried this place a couple times over a year ago now, but doubt anything has changed. I disagree with the implication that chipotle or qdoba is inferior to this place. They are comparable, but I would rank chipotle significantly higher. So long as you don't think of this place as a mexican restaurant or receive the food for free, you might not be disappointed.

Come here to remind yourself just how good places like El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara are."}
{"text":"Alright, I thought Burrito Drive was always more potential than actual deliciousness the first few times I ordered; that was probably because I tried to make my own burrito, which was fine. I also got some chorizo tacos once, which were also fine.

Then I finally decided to order a burrito off the menu, and let me describe the beauty that is the Sheh-neh-meh burrito. It's worth any humiliation you may incur in saying its name out loud earnestly. 

The combination of an especially delicious and smoky version of bacon (Neuske's) with the sweet potato puree, plus the charred grilled chicken, plus the salty cheese, PLUS the acidity of the rare bite of pickled onion, is a pretty spectacular melding of flavors. It just works out perfectly. Every taste bud is working, but in a complementary way. 

If you're missing spice just add some salsa to the dryish swaths of white rice that inevitably appear. I even added diced tomato and cilantro (for free) to add another layer of flavor and it honestly wasn't overkill. I can't endorse this burrito enough. 

So no, Burrito Drive isn't the greatest Mexican place, and I probably would go/order from a more authentic place if I wanted a full Mexican meal. But, they have the unique ingredients of bacon and sweet potato (and also great Mexican cheeses), and they know how to use them. So take advantage as long as you're here."}
{"text":"After coming home from a long night of dancing, this was a great midnight fix. I had the Hungry Hippy Burrito and it was delicious, until my lips started burning! It was a very tasty burrito but unfortunately it seemed that the chefs may have cross contaminated some of their fish tacos with the contents of the burrito I had. I'd rather have not had an large allergic reaction, but I mean. The food is good. Just try and work on that guys!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. I kind of equate it to an unstable relationship. When you come to my door late at night after I've been drinking you're always so prompt and great and I enjoy you. But when I just want you early at night to watch tv and chill you come promptly but stale and cold and wish I never called you. The only consistent thing about this place is the can of sofa they provide."}
{"text":"The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is the best thing to eat at Burrito Drive.  It has big pieces of bacon and sweet potato puree, which make a great combination.  And I don't even like sweet potatoes.  All of the other burritos I've tried here are good too, but I keep going back to the Sheh-meh-neh.  Other than burritos I've had the wings and chips and salsa, all good but not anything too special.  

I know they deliver, but I usually go in person to get my fix.  You just walk up to the counter to get service.  The people who work there are friendly, but sometimes you might have to ring the bell to get their attention.  

Their prices are fair, a little higher than what you might pay at another burrito place, but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food coloring and chemicals in all the dishes. Bad ingredients. Horrid service."}
{"text":"OMG, too bad there isn't a ZERO star rating. I haven't had a bite of this food yet, but I will never order from there again. Two hours waiting. 

First order was someone else's. I called to say that it wasn't not my order, and the driver actually came back to my house and asked if I was sure. 

Why yes, I'm a vegetarian, I didn't order a pork something and a chicken something. 

Two hours waiting and still not food. 

Total fail on all levels. Will eat whatever arrives next out of total desperation."}
{"text":"Once you get past the $8 price tag and the smaller portions the Happy Hippy burrito is a minor vegan treasure. Tatter tot's, guac, pickled onions and slaw are a welcome change from your standard bean burrito. Late night hours and delivery are a plus."}
{"text":"My go to place for  takeout Mexican.  Chorizo tacos are on point, as well as the chimichangas and enchiladas.  Can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Burrito Drive regularly over the the past 3 years. I'd say I've placed more then 40 orders here. Their desserts are pretty amazing (Chocolate Bread Pudding and Golden Rod Tres Leche) . My only complaint is that the portions can be inconsistent. If I ask to hold the rice and then choose to add $4 worth of additional toppings the burrito usually still comes smaller then if I had skipped the additions and stuck with the rice. I'm just trying to get more nutritional content for studying. I'm of the opinion that adding 4 dollars more covers the price of making a burrito of comprehensive size sans rice. I'd probably order from here more often if I knew the rice burritos came the same size as a riceless burrito with $4 in add ons. First world problems, smdh."}
{"text":"I hate having to write this review. Burrito Drive used to be one of my favorite takeout/delivery places in Madison, if not my favorite. I just ordered from there again after having not in awhile. I was severely disappointed. The burrito went from being a perfect, compact , & filling burrito to just another quantity instead of quality burrito. Just another terrible, messy, huge burrito with little flavor.

On top of that I found a piece of charcoal in my burrito. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS A PIECE OF CHARCOAL IN MY BURRITO. Thankfully I was eating with a knife and fork so I saw it and didn't end up chewing on it. Seriously could have been a horrible experience if I was eating the burrito with my hands.

Something has changed there and now this place is bad. I'll be reluctant to order from them again and only would in worst case starving & nothing is open scenario.

I will try them again in hopes this was a fluke because this place was really really good when I was ordering from them a lot this past fall/winter."}
{"text":"I am pretty upset with Burrito Drive this evening. After spending close to $40 (with tip mind you) I did not receive my chips for my chips and guacamole. I called immediately and was offered a coupon for free chips and salsa. I said that I really just wanted my chips and could I please just get those, 

The young woman on the phone said they were pretty busy and she would have to wait till the delivery driver got back to even see if that was possible (I have worked at restaurants that deliver, why couldn't she call the driver to see if that could happen? don't they have a cell phone? it's pretty hard to be a delivery driver without a cell phone) She said she would ask the driver as soon as they got back,

 I called 40 minutes later and it was pretty clear the driver had not even been asked yet. She said the driver would bring some to my house quickly, It is now 55 minutes since that second call and almost 2 1/2 hours since I first placed my order. Still no chips. :(

 Why would I want the chips and guacamole without the chips? Super disappointed in the service tonight. Don't know that I will be spending my money again any time soon. May seem like a simple thing, but I really wanted chips and guacamole and I paid for them so I should have received the chips or if it wasn't possible to deliver then take the chips off my bill.

The point is, I was in the middle of doing homework that was time sensitive and I couldn't leave my house. Thus the reason I got delivery. So yes chips are a simple thing to go get, but I shouldn't have to when I already paid to have chips delivered."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time since I forgot my lunch at work. I ordered the steak burrito - added white onions and diced tomatoes with the red salsa. DELICIOUS! The steak was perfectly charred, and the vegetables tasted fresh. My only complaint is add a little more of the asadero sauce then it would be even better. $13 for delivery plus $5 tip well worth it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just across the train tracks on the strip mall. Friendly staff. Nice dining area. Bathroom is all jacked up from vandals. Hot sauce ain't gonna destroy your mouth. Chorizo tacos were acceptable. Overall satisfied with my 10 o clock dinner. Will rate burritos in the future because they look mad decent."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive almost single-handedly saves deilvery food in Madison from boredom and closing too early.  The food is fresh and hand-made, easy to customize and not what you'd expect (and that sweet potato business is AMAZING!).  Delivery is usually very quick, accurate and friendly even at 2am.   

I do wish it was a little less expensive, but I realize the value in paying more for fresh and hand-made and delivered to my door."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great grilled chicken burrito with guac for free. I thought it was better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular of this place and it was great. Tasty food and decent portions. Recently they changed their prices and sizes and it's gone far down hill. From 4.5 - 2."}
{"text":"First bite of She meh neh=chicken knuckle. 
Two more bites = chicken knuckles.
I used to love but can't do meat here any more. Gagging while typing. 
Sad to say..."}
{"text":"Kicked me out of their establishment as I kindly told them someone stole my jacket and I was also a very kind and paying customer of their establishment. Please expect to be treated like shite"}
{"text":"They'll deliver a burrito - that's cool. The burritos are essentially drunk food, lots of protein and not that exotic, but they fill you up.

More than one of their delivery guys have given me desperate phone calls, asking where my house is cause it's dark (after over an hour of waiting). They pay no attention to \"hold the onions\" either - again, based on repeated experiences. Ahh Willy street hippies...."}
{"text":"I give this place credit for adding another type of food you can have delivered to you but my burrito was kind of bland.  It did seem fresh enough though and the lady that took my order was very nice.  Me and my friend agreed that it was just \"ok.\"  It's a local business though so I'll give them another try next time I want an americanized burrito rather than going to the MikeyD's of Mexican that is Chipotle."}
{"text":"These burritos are great. Honestly the best I have ever eaten. I had the Shemehneh burrito, and the sweet potato puree with the bacon was incredible. I had a bite of my friends' slaw and beer braised pork, and that was also next level. Also, I had salsa verde and it was incredible,; the best I've had. Eat here immediately! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at Burrito Drive, and was skeptical, being raised in Texas and growing up on authentic Mexican food. I ordered the 3 taco plate with carne asada, on flour tortillas. Blown away! It was good. I was a very happy customer! They use fresh ingredients and combine ingredients the way real TexMex is done. Fresh guacamole, (not the fake, bright green stuff you get at other places), Perfect cheese, too. The tortillas were good, but I prefer mine a lot thicker and fluffy. Never the less, it was money well spent. These days, if I'm going to part with my hard earned money, I darn better be satisfied. Burrito Drive made me more than wiling to do this, and I plan on making the 80 mile round trip again, for sure. Well worth it. 

I brought home chicken enchiladas for my son. Even after reheating it, he said to report that it was great! 

It's a small place, easy to miss, unless you're looking for it. That made it all the more good since everyone in our party of 4 knows what wonderful food lies in those small, hole-in-the-wall places in the communities of South Texas. 

I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially those in Madison area who get what I mean when I say \"real\" TexMex. 

Shout out to the awesome staff, too. Nice vibe to go with good food."}
{"text":"No doubt, my favorite for yummy mexican style goodness.
I usually stick to ordering pizza or asian...however...I tried ordering a big yummy burrito from my fave spot and lo and behold....MAGNIFIQUE....I'm in love and now harboring the best 'food baby' one could have."}
{"text":"Hands down my all-time favorite late night, after the bar food. Service is always timely, in store or home delivery. Drivers are always warm, friendly, and seem genuinely happy to chat a bit with you while you sign for your grub. 

     One of the perks of eating in the actual restaurant is you can enjoy a cold, Wisconsin brewed beer while you wait for your meal! Nothing quite like a New Glarus Moon Man to put on just the right buzz before you crush a monster burrito.

     Speaking of the food, just mouthwateringly delicious. Their habanero salsa (hottest of the bunch) will have you sweating in the best way possible. Their chips and guacamole? To die for. Don't forget to throw in a few garlic crema dips for good measure. They're also always super generous with special order instructions. Want a double helping of hollandaise sauce on your Steak and \"egg\"? Boom, done. Easy on the rice? You got it. Want a certain ingredient on the side? Easypeasy. Talk about knowing how to develop a loyal customer!

     If there is one last thing I can say about the ladies and gents that run this fine establishment, it is this. These mother fuckers make such an amazing god damned burrito, that I had my parents bring an order of food across state lines for me when they came down to visit me at school. That's right, I ordered Burrito Drive out of state I love it that much. 

Spend your money here!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the ideal stop for a late night burrito, which in my opinion is more than enough reason to give 4 stars. They have creative filling combinations and generous portion sizes. On a few burritos they substitute sweet potato purée for beans, and while I'm not a huge fan I have several friends who swear by it. The east side isn't exactly overflowing with late night eating options, so thank you burrito drive for providing a valuable service."}
{"text":"I've eaten their food so many times in the past few years I've lost count. Not everything is perfect (chicken wings are the only ones that come to mind), but most everything I've had I enjoyed. Chicken enchiladas? Thirty times enjoyed. Classic tacos? Yup. They cost an extra buck or two but its worth it."}
{"text":"Came here around midnight on a weeknight after a couple drinks at a bar.

Seems mostly like a drunk food joint though it was pretty empty.

Interior was clean and there was a TV showing ESPN.  Service was very friendly and decently speedy.

Sheh-meh-neh Burrito was good, especially the sweet potato filling.
High roller burrito was OK... a bit bland.

Tortilla chips and salsa were bland and limp.

Tortilla wraps for the burritos were pretty unremarkable, too.

Overall an OK place for late night food."}
{"text":"It's a great, creative restaurant. Small, kind of a hole in the wall, but they come up with a lot of tasty dishes. I never would have thought to put sweet potato puree in a burrito, but surprisingly, it works! I love the BD quesadilla and Carnitas burrito. If you call for delivery, service is quite fast. The people who work there are fast, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great twist on the usual Mexican fare in Madison.  Who knew sweet potato purée would be so awesome in a burrito??  Mexican food delivered to work-awesome!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly unique!  Who knew a burrito could be this delicious?  They have something for everyone and every taste.  Love it!  You will be in a food coma afterward, however.  Large portions.  I thoroughly love this place and love that they deliver (quickly)!  Fresh ingredients and savory."}
{"text":"I love Burrito Drive. Fantastic service. The late night hours are great. I appreciate the very inexpensive delivery fee. Also, I really appreciate the simplicity of most of their packaging. If you order a burrito it comes in a paper bag and wrapped in easily recyclable aluminum."}
{"text":"Upside for the burrito isn't particularly high. You either do it very well, or you fail collosally (sp). I'm happy to repeat this place does it well, and I've had it delivered several times during late nights at the office."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick burrito, taco or quesadilla, this place is okay. Nothing great about the food, however it is not bad. The staff is very friendly and they are quick with orders.  If you are looking for a quick burrito or taco, I would recommend going to one of the chains over Burrito Drive."}
{"text":"The house enchiladas with chorizo and shrimp are awesome!  Everything they sell is over par for a delivery mexican style restaurant but the prices are fairly high too.  I order from here quite a bit because the taste of the food is worth the extra couple bucks."}
{"text":"3 small tacos for $12??? They werent even good. They were ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the 40 minute wait or the $12. This place is like the chubby bartender who sleeps around. Unless youre drunk and desperate, you can probably do better."}
{"text":"Loves the burrito drive! Be sure to order a specialty burrito, if you try to build your own you'll just screw it up! The braised pork and shamena burritos are favorites at our house. An order of chips is enough for one person. Probably skip the chips and dip - the bean dip isn't very good and the amount of  guac you get is not worth the price. 

--below I clicked beer and wine - they only have beer."}
{"text":"I appreciate any place that caters to staying open late, is custom in it's style (even if it's a humble kind of style-for yeah, the atmosphere isn't super), and got some choices if you just want a veggie burrito after the bars close. 

Not too expensive, and the burritos are huge. I remember thinking how I hate T.V.s in restaurants and bars, but the giant one they had there (they just up and handed me the remote for it to flip around) made waiting for my order worthwhile. 

Did I forget to mention that they are open late for the bar crowd?"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious non-Mexican Mexican food I've had in Madison. Is it fine dining wrapped in normcore clothes? Small business fast-casual with Midwestern pragmatism? *shrugs*

Our guy behind the counter rec'd the Sheh-meh-neh burrito, which was on point, who knew sweet potato mash goes good in burritos, but I was rightfully suspicious of his red sauce rec bc I know my body and my body likes green sauce so that's what I went with. Holy chicken it was delicious. 

Carnitas tacos were also nothing to mess with and they came in an easy to deliver box (we ordered to go). The meat bits were crispy and tender with a little hint of sweet, tasty good with green sauce and slaw. 

The interior is kind of damp and drab, but I suppose they provide tables and chairs out of courtesy. Most of their business seems to run on delivery or takeout. 

*this review was written while completely sober."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos, great burritos.  Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned.  Reasonable prices, but it's a lot more than you'd pay at a crappy chain somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to try Burrito drive!  I ordered delivery for the first time last week.  It was recommended to me by friends to try the Grilled Chicken Burrito.  I also looked through their menu and couldn't resist the sweet potato Quesadilla.  It was a good choice. It was AWESOME.  Those caramelized onions in with the sweet potatoes and the dipping sauce made it perfection.
The delivery was quick and the driver was very nice.  I always happen to be just outside of the delivery area of other places on Willy/Atwood, but I was excited that they have a larger delivery area.
The Chicken Burrito was good, I wished that the salsa was in the burrito and not on the side.  The flavor of the chicken was really good.  I was very pleased and I'm sure will be ordering again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I have found my 'Vetos' of Madison!!!!! (If you don't know what I'm talking about reference down to my review of Vetos (;)

So happy when my roommates brought me here, and when I learned that they deliver! And they serve beer :)

Definitely a place to hit up after the bar from some good Drunk People Food. My roommates ended up getting the steak quesidilla, tater tots, and the chips and cheese (Which is just tortilla chips and a cup of cheese) and their friend got the Fish Tacos, I on the other hand got possibly the best tasting thing ever at 2am The Hungry Hippie Burrito. So good, yet so messy! It had Rice, tater tots, guac, and Mexican salw I believe it was. I got a side of Sour Cream, and their Red Salsa with it. It paired perfectly while watching Family Guy on the TV (You never can go wrong with Family Guy while eating a burrito, drunk.) 

I only finish about a 4th of it due to it being so big, but bagged up the left overs, and was on our way."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. After all, I've been eating here for years, since the beginning, often after drinking. It is convenient. The service is good. The location is good. The food is terribly inconsistent, though. Sometimes it is tasty; but more often, it's terrible. A common problem is a general lack of seasoning. Occasionally, the meats have a rubbery texture, which is off-putting. The I've had bland, undercooked beans and bland, undercooked rice. The bacon lardons are almost never properly rendered, which makes them extremely unpleasant to eat. When you order a High Roller Burrito, and it is not executed well, it makes you feel poor. To be fair, the medium red salsa, pickled red onions, guacamole, and sweet potato puree are all very good. Regardless, I'll probably be making my own burritos, at home, instead."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from these guys for almost a year. This is probably one of the best burrito places I've ever eaten at. The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is UNBELIEVABLE! Delicious tender succulent marinated chicken, with some red onions, topped with a thin layer of sweet potato puree!

It's that wonderful euphoric delight where both salty and sweet collide and form a paradise in your mouth...like a chocolate covered pretzel...or pigs in a blanket! I love this place and order from it so much, they knew me by name...kinda embarrassing but awesome at the same time.

If you're looking for a late night snack or just a mid-day fill up, I highly recommend Burrito Drive."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I have never been to the actual Burrito Drive restaurant but we have had it delivered.

The good. One: there is a wide variety of burritos, enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas to choose from. Ingredients vary, in fact you can choose your own. Two: the portion sizes are huge. None of us were able to finish our burritos in one sitting. Three: the delivery time was amazingly fast. The delivery vehicle must have left the restaurant within minutes of getting our order.

The bad: One: Without the salsa, all four burritos we tried were bland. Even the chorizo and adobo chicken options. Two: Although the burritos were huge, the containers of salsa were tiny and were not full. That was unfortunate since the salsas were really necessary to provide flavor. They really needed to provide at least two and preferably three containers per burrito.

Large portions and speedy delivery are a good start, but unless they improve the flavors, I wouldn't recommend Burrito Drive."}
{"text":"I love burrito drive! First, they are the only delivery place to brings piping hot burritos to your door...until 3am. Talk about service! :-) Second, I am a super picky eater so I always get the build your own, which is more than I can eat in one sitting and at a reasonable price! :-)"}
{"text":"This place is a major joke. I had the only vegan option on the menu, but had to pay extra to add beans! No protein in a vegetarian burrito? Absurd. After that upcharge my total was around $9. I'll never go back. I'm sure it's great if you're a college bro spending mom and dad's money after a late night of binge drinking, but for people who actually know what good Mexican food can be like avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The specials of Burrito Drive are (you guessed it) burritos! They serve up some interesting variations on this Mexican staple, my favorite being the She-meh-neh burrito. This combination of chicken, bacon, sweet potato filling, rice, cheese, and onions fulfill the sweet, savory, and umami flavors that make me crave food from here more often than I like to admit.

They have good tasting meat here, which is something I consider very important while grading any restaurant. It's succulent and charred meat has been much more of a hit than a miss for the many times I've ordered from here. 

This is one of my main go-tos for delicious and unique food in Madison."}
{"text":"Quick. Convenient. Relatively inexpensive. SO GOOD. I love building my own gigantic burrito, but the quesadillas and tacos are fabulous as well!"}
{"text":"As much as I've come to love their burritos, I'm giving up on Burrito Drive. I've tried over the summer to keep my enthusiasm but I'm not trying any more.

The only good thing about this place is the food.  The bad things, listed here, have caused me to walk away: (1) slowness of service, (2) late deliver times, and (3) inaccuracy of the orders.

(1) If I place an order over the phone to pick up at your location, don't tell me to be there in 10 minutes when, 10 minutes later, you haven't even started on my order.  Also, don't say, \"No, it will be ready in 10 minutes\" when I offer to be there in 15 or 20 minutes.

(2) If you tell me that the order will be delivered in 30 to 50 minutes, don't show up in an hour.

(3) If I order chips and salsa, bring me the damn salsa."}
{"text":"Got the create your own tacos for 7.25, soft flour, carne asada, asadero cheese, and pico de gallo salsa. For what seems like whole on wall (it'd be easy to miss this restaurant since it's not facing the street and it's next to coin laundry). The wait was worth it. Carne asada was very good. I agree with one of the reviewers, price for a lot of items on the menu is kind of on the high side. If you are in Madison, a must-go foodie place."}
{"text":"Burrito drive is pretty good.... They have odd combination of ingredient but they work... Definitely not your typical  burrito place... I have tried a bunch of different places in Madison and this one so far is my favorite.... Good salsa fresh ingredients and creative menu... Plus they deliver  yay!!! I love the garlic crema so yummy, didn't want to share with the boyfriend..."}
{"text":"We looove you, burrito drive! The sheh-meh-nah burrito is amaaaahzing!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum...
Got this delivered last night... While it may have been the most I have spent on delivery ($35), it was good food, especially considering it is fast and cheesy, greasy Mexican fare.
I got the cheese enchiladas and while they bordered on being too cheesy, I finished them quickly! They were really good.  My man got the burrito.  I don't remember what it was called but it was huge and packed with beef and he really enjoyed it.  We also got chips and dip and the bean dip stuff was really good, just wish we would've gotten more.  They also have really good guac and pico.
I will definately be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff, okay food.

I got a Shehmehneh Burrito as this seems to be the most popular order here. I saw that there was sweet potato puree in it and was pretty curious. The combination of tastes didn't really work that well for me though. I did like the pickle crunch, rice, and chicken though. 

I think this is a decent place to go to if you are in a rush or have no other options nearby. They have alot of different of options. Probably wouldn't get the Shehmehneh again, but would be willing to give the other items a shot."}
{"text":"Im a big guy....And i love healthy portions of food.  Well this place does not disapoint!  The burritos are so good.  I think i downed like 6 of them.  The staff was very friendly and the place is really clean.  I just wish they would give you a bigger portion of Mexican rice!"}
{"text":"Ah, Burrito Drive, it's been a fun ride but I'm ending things with you now. You used to be so dependably yummy, such a great source of quick delivery burritos at random hours. But now you've grown boring and you're slacking on basic quality. Why don't you ever offer new menu items? Why don't you reduce the price for burritos ordered without a tortilla? Why have your portions shrunk? Why is your adobo chicken quesadilla now a miniature version of its former self? Why is your staff so salty & unhelpful when we call to say you screwed up the order? I think we need to take a break. You probably should take this personally."}
{"text":"This is a good place for late at night when you are super hungry as the burritos are very large. They are also very good about letting you do substitutions, so of there ris something you would like to change about your order speak up. Substituting rice for tater tots is great!"}
{"text":"It's a really good place. They have amazing, innovative ideas like \"white trash\" burritos and whatnot. It sortof reminds me of Ian's pizza but..for Mexican food. They offer pretty decent delivery(a little slow but you get it). I really recommend their cheese enchiladas..as far as those go - really good. I'm not as much of a fan of their sides(rice&beans) as I've been at other places and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my service today. I had ordered no cheese in my burrito for delivery service and received with cheese. I'm allergic to dairy and was just hoping to get a refund. The receipt on the bag said no cheese so I assumed it was safe to eat- I was terrified and surprised to see cheese when I bit into my burrito. I called and politely explained I'd like a refund and the best they could do was credit my account for future purchases or remake and deliver. Considering I had waited almost an hour for the burrito to be delivered (which was expected, no issue there), I did not want to wait another hour. Will not be trusting them in the future."}
{"text":"Even after a night of drowning my tastebuds in liquor, when I am too drunk to be sure exactly how I got to Burrito Drive, I am still sober enough to realize that I have just been served dog food in a tortilla.

Do not make the mistake of ordering, unless it is 3 AM and you are desperate for a late night taco. Even then, I'm pretty sure Taco Bell is still open.

Will I go back? Sadly, it's too close to Plan B for me to be guarantee that I won't. Curse you late night cravings!"}
{"text":"I don't order out a great deal but when I do it is usually late.  Burrito Drive delivers late.  I like that.  I also like that they do have a fair amount of vegetarian options.  The burritos are big.  So much so that I normally have half for the moment and the second half the morning after.  I have had the Hungry Hippy and alway get the beans and rice or chips and guacamole as a side.  Is this a meal fit for a king?  Of course not, but who would expect that of any restaurant that is affordable and delivers to the college campus crowd?  Are they better than most?  You betcha.  

They deliver on time, the food is always very good and I have never once thought to complain. 

My only negative is that they are slightly, and I mean slightly, on the expensive side but again, measuring food quality to late delivery and customer service, I think that it is appropriate.  (Tip your delivery guy well people, regardless of from where they are delivering!)

All in all, I like Burrito Drive and have willingly and will willingly use them often."}
{"text":"Delivery until 3 AM! Sit down seating available. There is something for everyone on this menu. Good selection of vegetarian options. Try the house salad and the won tons! Not really Mexican food, more Mexican-inspired."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive offers a new twist on a well-loved old friend of mine, the burrito. The sheh-meh-neh burrito is the new love of my life. The creamy flavor of the sweet potato purée is surprisingly addicting. Also, the burrito is huuuuge; come hungry, leave satisfied. 

The inside was no frills but I was there for take-out so that's fine by me. The staff were friendly, attentive, and speedy! My food was out in mere minutes, impressive."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive is white people food. There's nothing authentic Mexican about it.  That said, it's damn tasty and really hits the spot. If you want fairly good food that's open late, go here."}
{"text":"Ordered a late night burrito for delivery.  One steak and the other chicken.  My steak had a few pieces but was mainly rice and beans.  Not only was this this a rip off, it was probably the worst burrito I've ever had."}
{"text":"All I care about is the hotdog in a baguette with the garlic chevre. Good place for food after bar time. Great tots!"}
{"text":"Voll gute Burritos! Selbstgemacht und mal keine Kette. Preis-Leistung von der Menge und vom Geschmack ausgezeichnet, hat mal richtig frisch geschmeckt.
Das Ambiente war etwas ranzig, aber so mag ich das!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Delivery fast. But I can't believe I paid $18 with tip for a steak quesadilla with almost no fillings at all, the missing green peppers I ordered as an extra and the tiny container of guacamole.  My hopes were high for a filling meal. Not so much.  Everything tasted good but it was way over priced. I just think that if you pay $10+ for a quesadilla it should include more than a few pieces of meat and a sprinkle of cheese, you know?
Not sure if I'll try again."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver, and the service is prompt.  I'll get them sometimes, but I've never been blown away by how good the burritos actually are.

That said, not a lot of other places in town will deliver a burrito, so I can't argue that."}
{"text":"Not a bad delivery or pick up choice in Madison if you're looking for something relatively cheap and fresh. I actually thought the ingredients were higher quality than Qdoba (they also had sweet potatoes as an option, so I'm in!). The service was fast when I ordered from the counter to go."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive is the bomb. It's tempting to order from here every time my friends and I get delivery food.

Their Hungry Hippie burrito is one of my favorites, and the Chicken burrito.  Right now I am obsessed with the house salad, which makes other restaurants' salads look sad. 

My friends also love the Chicken Chimi and the Wontons, but I haven't tried them.

The delivery time and quality is excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hungry Hippie.

Nuff said. 

Okay, just kidding...I'll write some more.

So what if the staff is stoned off their bums, and it's not TECHNICALLY mexican food, its hella good. Seriously, I could eat one of their burritos every week. 

Te amo Burrito Drive!"}
{"text":"About as good as 'white boy' burritos get. I'd put this at least 3 notches above Chipotle, and really only a notch below the better taquerias in town like Pastor, Gemelos, and Guadalajara.

Burritos seem on the expensive side but they're quite large, full of lean marinated strips of steak apparently cooked to order, and served with a tasty and large side of salsa. They also make the delivery trip well. Free chips and salsa are noteworthy.

Tacos, on the other hand, are small and arrive cold. There's really not a good way to keep them warm if they're travelling for anything more than 10 minutes. Some of their larger 'specials' are too costly and don't quite reach the heights of their burritos, especially their torta. 

So a very strong recommendation for burrito and chips delivery. This is a genuine contribution to what must otherwise be the worst college food delivery city in the country. Half the restaurants in town deliver for a half-mile radius, which is absurd since there's never any traffic. Burrito Drive, in contrast, delivers almost everywhere and offers quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive continues to impress and be our favorite place to order out. All 4 kids have favorites. Delicious food, always prompt delivery, and management that truly cares. Had a glitch on a busy Friday night (while the rest of the order was its usual delicious); the manager listened carefully to me without making me feel he was busy and compensated the (rare) error. Their entire staff is always professional and fun to work with, including on this night. And it can't go without saying that their red salsa is hoarded here after an order. Thank you BD!!!"}
{"text":"Walk into Burrito Drive at 2:30am. Go up to the register and be greeted by a nice gentleman. Ask what they are known for. You order. Chips come to the table with hottt Salsa. Yes! The Sheh-meh-neh burrito comes out within less 7 min. It's huge but  you devour it. Sweet potato purée, grilled chicken, pickled red onion, bacon!, quest fresco. You leave at 3am when they close mostly sobered up. I call that a success."}
{"text":"Love burrito drive! Friendly service and fast especially when you get an order delivered. I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"The house salad was very good actually. I liked the mix of greens and the dressing, the whole thing tasted fresh. I had a carnitas burrito which was good, bismati rice and sweet potato in side was a good flavor. I didn't really like the green salsa, it was more sweet than savory. I'd defiantly order this again but try a different salsa next time."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive is amazing! I love the food, and its open until 3 AM. There's also delivery within a far-reaching area. 

I recommend the Wontons, the Chimichangas and also the Enchiladas. 

They make their own sour cream, people! It's tasty.

I'm kind of shocked that it is not on Yelp yet!"}
{"text":"I keep meaning to come back here.  Any place that thinks to put *tater tots* in their burritos deserves all of my money.  

Sooooooooooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"So inconsistant, it's not worth the money.

I've eatten delivery three times now. Two times they screwed up my order, and one time they screwed up the other person's order. Infact the very last time, she ordered something straight from the menu, and they didn't put cheese on it, like the menu said. 

One time we ordered off their dessert menu, and they gave us something with beef in it. We called them to let them know and they actually argued with us. They tried telling us we were confused at what we were ordering. We ordered chocolate and we got beef, we wern't confused. They told us we wouldn't be getting our dessert unless we still had the beef things and we said that was fine...But come on, what are they going to do with the food after they delivered it? Plus, no one ever apologized or compensated us for a vegitarian biting down into a beef something when it should have been dessert!

The only reason why we tried it three times is because when they actually got the order right, the food was pretty good, and it's a great plus that they deliver practically always."}
{"text":"To be fair, I was pretty hungry at the time but the salsa with the chips was really good. I ordered a carnitas burrito w/out really reading the full description. It had sweet potato puree in it which is some evil genius sh**. I work at a burrito place and kind of have a thing for trying burritos. This was defo the most interesting/memorable one I've ever had. It took a while to make, but when it came out it was like a perfect temp. Just overall very solid. I've been to a ~5 places in Madison that make burritos and this is #1 w/ El Jalapeno on the west side close #2"}
{"text":"I've \"heard\" good reviews of this place, yet have been hesitant, as the written reviews have been only fair. On a whim during a recent Saturday night, my dinner companion and I ended up stopping in. I ordered the  Chicken Enchilada, he ordered the Chicken Quesadilla. Whilst we were waiting, as we chose to dine in, it was difficult to not notice that maybe the tables are not completely wiped clean and it was a bit dated, but there was a genuine attempt at surface niceties (including a flat screen tv) and the sounds from the kitchen were pleasant and busy. There was also a steady stream of traffic for take-out orders. It was about a 10 minute wait, but both dishes arrived hot and were quite flavorful and tasty! I was ready for the \"chicken knuckles\", but pleasantly, never came across any! I'll be back to try the tacos and burritos!!"}
{"text":"The sheh-meh-neh burrito is the only thing you need to know here. Ignore all else. The first few times I ate here I went with my usual burrito chain order. I have to admit I was not at all impressed. On a whim with our work lunch order I decided on the sheh-meh-neh order as it is their \"thing\" and found a whole new appreciation.

The hot salsa is in fact, hot. The guac is tasty and fresh. Delivery, thanks to EatStreet is on point and quick. I can't say anything about the store, but delivery is wonderful.

Oh and not least, the cookie dough empanada...sorcery! Order this and enjoy. Fricken amazing."}
{"text":"I am going all in on Burrito Drive....well close to all in!  Best burritos in the city!

My friend loves Mexican food, and particularly loves burritos.  What is there to not like about a burrito?  Full of protein, carbs, a little dairy and minor veggie content, conveniently wrapped with ease of eating! Some burritos can lack taste, but Burrito Drive just does it right with some flavorful options for their burritos.

Our main staple has been the grilled chicken burrito.  I like to substitute the sweet potato puree for the beans, but either way is great.  We have also tried the steak burrito (Carne asada) and really enjoyed that.  The grilled chicken comes with guacamole, which I do recommend getting as a side if not on the burrito.  The salsa come on the side and in my opinion is nothing to write home about, but others may disagree.

The service is great.  Ordering is easy, either by phone or in person.  Don't be afraid to ring the bell to get service.  Their delivery option is pretty darn nice too and fairly quick.

It is in a small strip mall a half of block off of Wiley St; parking is easy.  They are open later than I care to stay up, but I bet it is a great late night option.

We did venture into the tacos, but definitely prefer the burritos.

It is a simple, non-assuming place, but seriously do not pass up a shot at their burritos."}
{"text":"Burrito Drive, I've been there once and loved it.  Its just off of Willy Street on Brearly, not the best location in the world and I fear it will get overlooked for that reason.  Regardless they're food is great.  Its not authentic Mexican, but it doesn't pretend to be - this is new Mexican food in all its glorious well combined tastiness.  I had a sweet potato burrito that was phenomenal.  They serve beer as well and have a nice little dining room.  You gotta check out Burrito Drive when you get a chance, maybe next time you're doing laundry since the laundromat is right next door."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican restaurant - if you're looking for authentic this is not the place for you... However, Burrito Drive has always been one of my favorite places to eat in Madison, delivery or otherwise! The big, rich burritos will satisfy your hunger and then some. Something for everyone! I especially recommend the Hungry Hippie burrito with pork.

I think people who have given a bad review have either tried to make their own burrito or ordered something that is NOT a burrito off the menu... I'd say if you're looking for a twist on the classic burrito, get one of their classic items and you will not be disappointed. Don't listen to the bad reviews, this place is more than worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've eaten here maybe 10 times?  Thereabouts anywayz.  They have a great looking menu but I must confess, I have only had their tacos.  The tacos are perfect...I have carnitas meat.  That's slightly charred pork served on a flour tortilla with a most excellent mexican slaw.  Ya....I may never eat another thing here!  And do you know what the dagger is?  It's their salsa.  It's home made and it's a killer!!  I prefer the hot but I've also had the green which was awesome too. I think these tacos are in the top three for Madison.  I eat tacos elsewhere but only because I may have a taste for a different taco.  These tacos are bomb."}
{"text":"I do enjoy their food, but every time (3 Times) I've ordered delivery I'm missing part of the order. For example- had a salad with grilled chicken added but no chicken with the meal. Make sure you double check before the delivery guy runs off!"}
{"text":"Last night was my second experience with Burrito Drive and I'm officially a fan. I ordered the steak quesadilla (with a side of guacamole) and my husband got the adobo chicken burrito. He really enjoyed his burrito (it was plenty good, I snuck a bite), but once he tried my steak quesadilla, that was it. He said: Oh man, I'm ordering that next time. And I totally get why. Because, um yeah............it was awesome!

The tortilla was crispy & warm & a little buttery. And the steak was SO tender and flavorful and delicious. Then there's the Asadero cheese, which is perfection - just the right combination of creamy and salty. Their red salsa is great, with just the right amount of smokiness & spice. And the guac - you guys! The guacamole is definitely worth the extra $$$. Definitely. The only aside were the tater tots which were underwhelming. They were lukewarm and no longer crispy by the time I got our order home, but I can't allow that to tarnish our positive experiences. Tots just don't hold/travel well, even when it's just a short distance.

Their portions are exceptionally sized and we have yet to be disappointed. We will be back. And we'll both get the steak quesadilla and you'll be sad you don't have one. It's just that good. Go on...... Give it a try.  :o)"}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant is in an unassuming area. The interior is no frills.  They're open late which is good if you're looking for a late night bite as they're isn't much open late in Madison. I found this restaurant on Yelp. You place your order at the counter. The food was prepared reasonably quickly. The menu is reasonably priced. I had the steak burrito which was decent size filled with steak, cheese, rice, beans, and peppers."}
{"text":"Like many, I seem to only visit Burrito Drive when I'm out on the town visit local bars. Any quick Mexican food is going to be a winner in my book, and I like the salsa varieties that Burrito Drive offers (pico, medium red, medium green, hot red). Their use of sweet potato puree in a few of their burritos is fantastic, and the ShehMehNeh is definitely a favorite.

A few low points: there are no nachos on the menu and this KILLS me. The closest you can get is a basket of chips and salsa or chips and guacamole. Big bummer.

Delivery can be tricky. A few years ago I had an unfortunate incident where I had paid by credit card for my delivery order online. Upon receiving my order, I was asked for payment. Assuming something hadn't worked with my card I paid cash and later realized my card was also charged. I called the store the next day, and played phone tag with the manager multiple times about the issue without resolution. I eventually gave up, and now have a good story about paying $25 for a burrito. Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"Ahh...my 500th review.  I put a lot of thought and consideration into which establishment I would review and after my midnight visit on a Sunday night, this floated to the top.  Burrito has stood the test of time (they have been open for as long as I can remember) and their 3 am close time have accommodated my oft inebriated self.  On Sunday night, my girlfriend and I were coming from a long Seattle weekend (and flight) and needed something quick and good.  Enter Burrito Drive.  Yes, at times, I think the quality suffers depending on the kitchen and the time but Sunday night, they were firing on all cylinders.  Having already wrecked any sense of healthy eating in Seattle, I opted for the White Trash Burrito-White Trash Burrito-Spam, tater tots, baked beans and spicy ketchup on the side.  Their burritos carry a definite heft and was exactly I was looking for-Filling with a side of guilt.  Spam never tasted as good. My better half ordered the Steak and \"Eggs\" burrito complete with Carne asada, rice, queso fresco,pickled red onion and hollandaise sauce.  This isn't your mom's Chipotle concoction.  There wasn't much talking as we ate in our kitchen so it must have been all right (or maybe because we were both exhausted).  Either way, we had no left overs so it worked out.
For those that rather gorge at home, they also have a huge delivery area. Definitely try them out!"}
{"text":"Greatest Mexican delivery in Madison. 

My friend, Monika, and I have decided to stay in multiple nights to order the delicious Burrito Drive. Our favs are the tacos with carne asada, carne asada quesadillas and cookie dough empanadas. All divine. I will continue to order Burrito Drive for the rest of my time in Madison."}
{"text":"Steak Burrito was the most nasty burrito I've ever had.  Tacos wasn't even hot and the service was the worst I've had. Waiting 30 minutes for some cold nasty food. place was full of drunk people with no taste buds. Maybe thats where they get good reviews from. Even trashy Taco Bell taste even better! Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Really?  Am I really the first person to recognize the awesomeness that is Burrito Drive?

No, can't be.  Surely someone else has realized that Burrito Drive is one of the only places (if not only) besides pizza that delivers until 3AM.  Surely someone else (besides my boyfriend) has enjoyed the \"Hungry Hippie\" burrito, which consists of the normal burrito stuff, plus tator tots and slaw, and an optional extra sweet potato puree, if you should feel so inclined.  

I normally get the quesadilla; boring, I know, but it's quite good with their pico and sour cream. Their chips are usually pretty good too -- try them with the black bean dip. I'll be honest with you all and say that the last time we were in town, we called BD two nights in a row (after a few drinks -- please!).  

It can get pricey, it is true.  And sometimes the food is a tad greasy.  But the unique and wide ranging menu, along with great delivery hours and quick and friendly service make BD an establishment that Madisonians must check out!"}
{"text":"Classic Tacos all the way! And the delivery drivers are totally sexy!"}
{"text":"I honestly just cannot get enough of this place! The food is incredible, fairly priced, and the staff is always incredibly friendly. I always order delivery and they have it to me within 20 minutes of me ordering. If you like this type of food I highly suggest trying this place out!
My personal favorite is the steak burrito and the chips and guacamole. You just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"One of the near east-sides best late night bites. When the other advertised late night restaurants say they are open - but predictably are not... Head to Burrito Drive. Indulge in the tater-tots... Love the tacos. Interestingly I don't order the burritos."}
{"text":"It's definitely not a classical Mexican joint in the sense that you can order Sweet Potato Puree and Tater Tots in your burrito but god is it good. Whenever I get crazy hungry I instantly order delivery from this place. Fast service and super yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this because I want to like Burrito Drive. They are right in the neighborhood, they deliver, and they are open late.

But, I've tried 3 times now and every time the food is terrible.

It is totally flavorless. 

Please make it better, Burrito Drive folks?"}
{"text":"I got the Seh-meh-neh and it was amazing. I had a really cute delivery boy, too. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. They're open until 3, they have unusually fast delivery times, and the people who work there are, without exception, extremely nice. That should be worth at least four stars, shouldn't it?

Ordinarily, I'd say yes. The problem, though, is that their burritos are utterly lacking in any flavor whatsoever and I always end up being shocked by the bill. 

That being said, if you do decide to order, you should definitely get a side of their cucumber crema. The garlic crema is good, but the cucumber is out of this world."}
{"text":"Great service and quick! Had the steak burrito, green sauce and guac and chips! Simple and yummy!"}
{"text":"Let me temper the above rating with the following missive.  Burrito Drive has stayed true to their formula and has a loyal following of people ranging from neighborhood professionals to late night denizens.  After some experimentation, my general go-to is still the house salad, which has a balanced and surprising array of items from mildly pickled carrot shavings to pepitos, cubed beets, queso fresco and a bed of nice fresh greens.  Outside of the cheese, the lack of protein requires some fast a la carte thinking.  Enter the braised pork, which, in the restaurant's earlier incarnation was fashioned from a marinaded and spiced shoulder and shredded.  What I was served instead was something entirely different, and consisted of a bowl of shredded pork which could have easily been included in one of those fancy dog food cans for a spoiled Pomeranian.  A pool of warm liquid in the bottom of the bowl raised my suspicion that it had also been \"nuked\" for the kitchen help's convenience.  Suffice it to say that if I ever order the house salad again, I will find another angle on braised pork, possibly even getting the to-go version purveyed at Nattspil, minus the bread."}
{"text":"I am now updating my review of Burrito Drive, as they seemed to have improved their ability to deliver the items purchased. In fact, their delivery service now seems pretty fast, and the food is better. The grilled chicken has a delicious char, the local bacon is caramelized and rich, and the burritos seem better composed than they once were.  Their guacamole is also wonderful, if a little overpriced.

I stand by my previous statement regarding their so called \"Golden Rod Tres Leches,\"  which is an atrocity against mankind, composed of three frozen twinkies swimming in melted whipped cream and condensed milk.  Stick to the burritos."}
{"text":"Went for late night burritos. The food was fresh and the burrito was packed full of great ingredients. The Mexican corn, when in season, is a must try for everyone. If your looking for late night eats this is among the top 3 for me."}
{"text":"6 sad looking tacos for $22 + tip. Not at all worth it, especially since there was about one drop of guacamole on each taco and only a few small pieces of asada. Also the delivery took like 45 minutes which seemed ridiculous. I had BD one other time and loved it but I doubt I'll get it again."}
{"text":"Third time at Burrito Drive. They are one of our go-to places because of the non-greasy meats and flavor. Last time was grilled chicken, sweet potato puree, pickled onion, and queso. This time tried the Carnitas--pork, sweet potato puree, pickled onion and queso. Nice flavor, love the bite of the onion, but very meager portion of meat. Seriously--like five chunks of meat in the whole burrito. It wasn't shredded like expected, but what was there had great flavor. We did take out and added some sour cream for a little more flavor--it went great with the salsa. 

Service was fast, from answering the phone to pick-up. It's pretty no-frills, but the price is more than fair. I'll also note for people that have been going there for a couple years that portion size have decreased. Last time I ordered, the burritos were easily big enough to split."}
{"text":"Burritos stuffed with unconventional (and fun!) ingredients that taste good, too. See cons for the three star rating, but I will try again soon and hopefully they'll go up to 4!

Pros:
*delivery
*steak and eggs burrito with hollandaise!
*good steak and generous amount in burrito
*super creative burritos


Cons:
*$28 for 2 burritos
*paid extra for guac and they barely put in any
*not that warm, cheese wasn't even melted
*salsa doesn't come inside the burrito"}
{"text":"Good food for Anglicized Mexican. Only order the tacos for delivery if you have access to a microwave as they'll probably not stay warm on the journey. Still, despite that, enjoyed the food more than I thought I would and delivery time was more than reasonable for the time I ordered it. Overall, a little pricey, but taste wise it's worth it. Would still recommend saving yourself a few dollars and order for carryout instead of delivery."}
{"text":"good food, no ketchup for the tots when delivered.  Wasn't a fan of the mexican wonton's either.  The burrito was good, but really wish they added sourcream to it.. over all, many more mexican places out there that taste better.  Although this place isn't bad, i would probably try something else close by the next time i'm in town for business."}
{"text":"Three or more times a year, I experience Burrito Emergencies.  These are times when I absolutely effing NEED a burrito but lack means to either make or leave my home to procure one.  This is why I was excited when Burrito Drive burst on the scene -- as it clearly can be of service during these urgent times.  
During my last Burrito Emergency, Burrito Drive did not deliver on taste or quantity.  For $8-10/burrito [after tip], I can beg a good Samaritan/cab driver to take me to Taco Bell/Qdoba and get us both Burritoed up.  My vegetarian burrito was bland even with the fresh pico de gallo. I also paid $1.50 for guacamole, and DID NOT receive $1.50's worth. (maybe a tablespoon was in there)  I ordered a chorizo burrito for my dear friend, and he was similarly disappointed.  Also we both ordered cheese, yet could not locate the cheese in our burritos.  We both agreed that we wouldn't absolutely REFUSE to order from there again, but neither of us would ever suggest it.  Overall, it tasted like fresh, well-prepared food -- just didn't really score points in the flavorful, cost effective, or \"abundant ingredient\" categories."}
{"text":"We've ordered a couple of times from here for delivery and they are really good! I love the sweet potato quesadilla, I have yet to try it with a protein, but I've heard great things about that particular upgrade. The adobo wings are not traditional at all but that sauce will always lure me back in - dark & tangy with a spice that gradually builds, good thing they serve them with an avocado crema for when you finally realize that this stuff is a little spicy! Also, kudos on the sauce portions, I love when you actually get a relative size! Yas. 

The burritos, as others have mentioned, are massive! I always shy away but the fella loves these things. He usually orders the high roller burrito and it has never let him down. The food is always spot on, delivery sometimes means a salsa/sauce is forgotten, but nothing too crazy...I will order from them again, for certain!"}
{"text":"In a word, too expensive.

The food is creative and fun, but it's not at a price point that most of the people who would be interested in this place are at.  Their chips and salsa is pure highway robbery too.  They charge $5.75 for it and must make about $4.00 per order.  My burrito (the Sheh-Meh-Neh) was actually pretty good, but there was something in it that tasted off.  It could have just been that one burrito, but I couldn't finish it---and that's not because it's a decent-sized burrito.  I ended up spending close to $16 on a burrito and chips, and I admit that the shock I felt then (I didn't realize the chips were so expensive) is infecting this review.  It may, in fact, be \"New Mexican Food\" but it's priced for the Nouveau Riche.

I would try other items on their menu, but I would much rather spend $10 elsewhere.  Perhaps some night when I'm hammered and money is flowing out of my pocket as fast as alcohol is pouring into my liver.  Until then, Adios."}
{"text":"Surf and Turf torta.  One of the best sandwiches ever! I am a big fan of BD. so nice that they deliver late to the near west side of town."}
{"text":"When I lived nearby, I ordered from Burrito Drive pretty regularly because they were the only late night option. They get 1 star from me because you have the option to go to the restaurant to eat, and some of the food is actually good. If it wasn't for that, I would give them 0 stars if I could. My favorites were the high roller burrito, the grilled chicken burrito, and the Tijuana hot dog (probably one of my biggest guilty pleasures).

That said, this story is about the COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE behavior of their late night staff. Over the course of a year of ordering food from them, they were regularly incompetent, rude, and downright hostile. Story time:

It started out with one chicken burrito that wasn't quite right. I found some bones in it (not one bone, but 4-5) and they included beans when I asked for them to be left off. I called the restaurant, politely (I think) explained the problem, and asked if they could replace the burrito. They seemed irritated but they did send me a new one.

The next mistake came when I ordered a Tijuana hot dog and chicken burrito. For the second time, I found bones (plural) in the burrito, and they forgot to include the sides of salsa and garlic sauce. That hot dog is nothing without the sauce, so I called and once again explained the situation. I asked if they could just send the forgotten sauces and said they didn't have to worry about the bones -- I would just pick them out. No big deal. The person who took my call was clearly annoyed, said \"I remember you,\" and called me a liar! He said they would send out the stuff I asked for but it was \"the last time.\" A driver arrived well over an hour later (around 3am) with a new, cold chicken burrito and no salsas. They managed to get angry, insult me, and send me the thing I specifically said I didn't need them to replace. I never got the salsa or garlic sauce.

Their third and final fuck up was so astronomical I felt it had to have been done on purpose (probably by Mr. \"I remember you\"). I ordered a chorizo burrito. What I received was a flour tortilla shell stuffed with rice that was soaked in orange grease. That's it. There were no other ingredients. There was no chorizo, no beans, cheese, or onions. It just looked like they poured chorizo grease from the pan on top of the rice and rolled it up. This time when I called, they hung up on me as soon as I started explaining what happened. They did this twice more, so I gave up. In the morning I called again, asked for a manager, and got a refund. The person I talked to in the morning was helpful, but I will never be giving this place my business again because of my experiences with their late night staff. 

TL;DR: This place wouldn't be in business if there was any other option for late night Mexican in that area. Do not order delivery after 10pm. The staff there is rude and too stoned to get orders right more than half the time."}
{"text":"Very friendly delivery drivers & phone/order takers, delicious food, and timely delivery! I'm visiting from out of town and travel all over the US for work and this, by far, is one of the best delivery places I've ordered from. Asked if they could deliver my food during a 15 minute window today and they were glad to oblige...and were ON TIME and courteous! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Rating only their delivery service which is terrible. Our house is clearly in their delivery area and we have seen them in our neighborhood, but on a Monday night did not want to deliver to us and did not want a $50 sale."}
{"text":"Food can be hit or miss, but there are some real gems in their menu, you just have to find them.  I pretty much always stick to the steak and eggs burrito (there are not any eggs in it) which is a great, though very rich, combination of steak, cheese, and hollandaise sauce.  The cranberry salsa is seriously good and the chocolate bread pudding is addicting.  Seriously, there are nights I order dinner from them just to get the bread pudding.  The chips and salsa are good, but overpriced for how much you get and the fish and tacos are bland.  I'd recommend trying some of the more unusual flavor combinations as that's where Burrito Drive shines."}
{"text":"Whoever wrote a review and stated they were from California and these aren't burritos are wrong. I haven't found a burrito this big in Northern California yet. I am not even halfway done and can't eat anymore. This is by far the best burrito I have ever had. 

A little scary if you are not from here and go there to pick up your food but it was clean inside compared to the outside. Staff was friendly and the food was made quickly. I will for sure come back when I am in Madison."}
{"text":"Ate here my first night in town, or at least had it delivered. I'm not sure if it was the exhaustion for moving or if it was the best burrito ever, but I thought it was the best burrito ever."}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 separate chances on getting my order correct and they messed up all 3 times."}
{"text":"Always swift delivery, and they've never messed up my order. Nice drivers, lovely late night meal, always hits the spot. Prices are comparable to Chipotle/Qdoba, but with local service and quality."}
{"text":"Try the place on a chance.  Ended up \"not\" disappointed.  The atmosphere is not much.  It's more set up for takeout and/or delivery.   Seating is very limited.    

Now the food was awesome.  Servings are HUGE and I mean HUGE !!   Burritos can just about serve two.  They own a unique menu and you will find something that makes your fancy.  

Give it a try.  I know you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty.  Who would have thought that tater tots on a burrito would work?  They do, quite nicely on the Hungry Hippie.  The husband had the High Roller and he was quite happy with the steak, but particularly the bacon was not cheap bacon, which is always a bonus.  And the hot salsa/ sauce (as it is a bit on the chunkier side) is actually pretty hot with decent flavor without singeing off the taste buds.  The space is small but apparently they deliver so if you're nearby, then you don't have to worry about finding a space in which to enjoy your yummy deliciousness.  They are open late hours, which is also a bonus.  Pretty sure when we return to the area, we'll be seeking out this little spot for a meal - good stuff!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I have no fucking clue where this place is. What is a Brearly Street anyway?  So many questions. What I do know is that when I'm in Madison for a couple days I eventually have a pretty civilized conversation with my stomach. It goes like this:

Stomach: Burrito?

Me: We just had breakfast.

S: Yeah, but burrito.

Me: They don't open until 11.

S:  Ok so burrito at 11?

Me: Maybe.

S. Don't you dare maybe me I will fucking end you.

Girlfriend: Who are you talking to?

Me: What? I'm not talking to anybody. Who would I be talking to? You're crazy. How do you feel about burritos for lunch?

Girlfriend: Again? OK. (leaves room)

S: That's right, bitches. Come to daddy, braised pork burrito.

So roughly 30 minutes after I'm verbally abused by one of my own internal organs a guy magically shows up with a tasty treat for me. I like the braised pork burrito, the high roller burrito and the steak quesadilla. When I eat them my stomach stops saying mean things to me and I don't have to cry myself to sleep."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Burrito Drive delivers all the way to us (about 4 miles away). For myself, that's about where my feelings of being pleased ends. Several reasons why. I ordered the chicken enchilada and a side of rice and beans. If you love cheese and don't mind that your enchilada tastes more than mildly of an Italian dish than Mexican, than this might be for you. So much cheese and so much tomato sauce. The rice and beans were very bland. The rice is Basmati rice, which in itself was odd, and the beans were watery. Now, my family ordered burritos and seemed to like them. I tasted one of the steak burritos, and although it was very bland, the quality of the steak tasted great and grilled. 
Bottom line here, pay attention to reviews. I read that the food was bland, but I thought maybe people were just being picky. No, it really is bland. I'd say B.D. is a good choice for soaking up a night of beer, or if you just wanna get full, but aren't looking for authentic flavors, as they are really absent."}
{"text":"Burrito drive is the exact kind of places the should be more of! Unpretentious, unorthodox, straight shooting, no nonsense burritos and tacos. There is a variety, but not too many. You can build your own, but their pre-built one are amazing. It's not a sit down place, it's a take out one. But the quality, the portions, the speed of delivery and the proximity makes this the go to choice for my fast food needs."}
{"text":"Back when I was 21 and ordering way too many rail whiskey drinks, I  dreamt of a burrito place that  would whisk hot, fresh Mexican to my door anytime of a day, preferable 2:30 AM.   

Seven years later, it finally exists.  Located mere blocks away from the house, Burrito Drive has a pretty interesting and whimsical menu.  I'm not one to care about authenticity and with things like Tijuana Hot Dogs, I'm not sure how I would judge but the Create-Your-Own Burrito I ordered at work was fresh and tasty.  My collegue ordered some of the chili which was also enjoyed. 

A little on the pricey side (chili and a burrito ran $12) but getting something tasty brought to me is worth the premium."}
{"text":"Alright for what it is. Was on foot on Willy street and needed some food after the bar .. this fit the bill; filled me up sufficiently.  Took a good 10 mins or so on a dine in order but not a huge deal. Burrito had Good tasting steak (carne) although a little light on it in terms of quantity (a lot of beans and rice). Kind of like a chipotle with dive-y atmosphere. Overall would come again but wouldn't be overly excited about it."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but it's to hit or miss. The flavors are always spot on. Just sometimes if you order a burrito you either get a nice amount of meat, or just rice and beans. And for $10 a burrito I want my F-ing meat."}
{"text":"When I lived in Madison about six years ago, Burrito Drive had only been around a short time.  I used to order delivery from them all the time.  Since then I've moved away, but I found myself in Madison recently with a late-night craving.  After all these years, could Burrito Drive still stack up?

The answer is a resounding yes.  I ordered three tacos with corn tortillas, roasted zucchini, asadero cheese, and cranberry salsa.  They were delicious.  

I was with some friends, and we also received some free chips and salsa for while we waited for our food to arrive.

Also, is it just me, or did the interior of this place get quite a bit nicer?  Maybe my recollection is off. 

Anyway, great experience at a classic Madison establishment.  Is it the most \"authentic\" food created by someone's Mexican grandmother?  No.  Is it delicious, creative, high-quality and inexpensive?  Yes!  I hope Burrito Drive sticks around for many more years."}
