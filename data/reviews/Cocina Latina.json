{"text":"I've seen this restaurant in \"Our State\" magazine on two.separate occasions, and pass it in the neighborhood on a regular basis. Being this close, it was only a matter of time before we ventured in.   Okay, so the first time I went (last week) it was not the best visit to review from. I met some friends since Julie was out of town and the parking lot was packed! Little did we know there was quite a party going on in there!! It was great! Live music, full band, singers, it was fun and loud. It was also packed.  The food was great, but I didn't get a chance to really look at the menu and get a full experience of the place.   So, I took Julie back tonight and it was even more delicious. The chips and salsa were good but not overacheivers. I ordered marinated pork tacos and rice and Julie got vegetarian enchiladas with red sauce. The food looked great coming out and it was very tasty. Cleaned plates for both of us! I indulged in a coke only because they serve it in tall glass bottles. You can't pass up classic.   The best part was only having a bill for $14 not including tip. Wow!! Needless to say we'll be going again, and again, and again..... this place is the real deal. I love it when we find a new restaurant*!!   *Special thanks to Tobe and Monica for taking the plunge with me last week. Without them this dining experience would have never happened!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food i have ate in Charlotte! I moved here almost a year ago and was looking for months for a good Mexican place. Prices are fair the customer service is great and a very clean place. U have a customer for as long as I'm around!"}
{"text":"Cocina Latina is amazing. The Barbacoa de Borrego is great, extremely flavorful. They make their own tortillas fresh. So good. Better than the Barbacoa I've had in LA. I don't think (non-Mexican) people in Charlotte really know what's up when it comes to real Mexican food otherwise this spot would probably have a few more reviews."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Amazing service and delicious tacos and burritos. What more can I say."}
{"text":"Located where Clever Cone used to be.. close to Robinson Pool/Silver Lane.. great location for tacos!!  Something different in the neighborhood. I heard about it from a dear friend and was excited to check out and write a review for the community.  Average pricing and quick service.  You order your tacos or meal and then add your toppings or put them in a little cup with a lid.. cilantro, lime,salsa, quac etc.  But there isn't sour cream or cheese.   By the time I was finished gathering all my toppings.. my order was ready.   The quac was good - fresh.   I sampled several of the tacos and all were good (beef, pork, chicken etc.) The tacos are made on a fresh soft tortilla (what seems to be) and so soft that it practically fell apart while I was eating it.  I gave up and ate my tacos with a fork.   The only two things missing from the menu was: Chips and Salsa and Taco Salad.  Okay.. this cute little taco place is strictly for \"Take out\" so the menu is a little limited but everything was fresh and flavorful.  I will be back to sample some of the meals.  Open 11 - 8 PM - Monday-Saturday and Sundays -  12-6 PM.  Parking available on the right side of the building.   Thanks Cocina Latina!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem , the food is excellent & the staff is very welcoming . On my visit I ordered the Barbacoa burrito which was filled with all quality ingredients that where prepared perfectly . The burrito is huge & is a hell of deal for the price . Do yourself a favor and give this place a try"}
{"text":"Happy to have another authentic Mexican place close by! We found Cocina Latina on Yelp when it first opened and decided to check it out. Not only is their food & service amazing but they deliver! I love having another delivery option besides pizza & Chinese food. Also, their delivery is super quick which is another bonus.   Everything that we have tried here has been delicious. All of their tacos (chicken, barbacoa, carnitas, carne asaa) are very flavorful with amazing toppings that don't overpower the meat. You can choose to have the tacos on corn or flour tortillas- we've had the corn and love them!  They have 3 homemade sauces that you can order on the side- habanero (veryyy hot!), tomatillo, and mild that all accent the tacos perfectly. We also tried to the taquitos and my new favorite the tostones. You also can't go wrong with their chips & salsa and rice and beans side dishes either. I think that Cocina Latina is going to be a staple in our diet this year. Highly recommended for quick & easy authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.....everything here is fantastic and deffiantly some ofb the best Horchetta I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good, but nothing great. I had the chicken tacos and they were not the best tacos I've had. The tortillas were thrown on the grill and immediately turned over, so they were not warm. The chicken, which was supposed to be in some kind of chipotle sauce, was bland. It tasted like plain shredded chicken and was dry. My friend who got chicken in her burrito said the chicken was dry too. I also ordered a side of beans, which were way too salty. I ended up coming home and chugging 3 bottles of water because of the amount of salt that was used. Next time, I'll probably try a different taco and skip the beans.  However, there were some good things about Cocina Latina that I will come back for. I LOVED the chips and guacamole. The guac was so fresh and creamy...mmm. The chips were crunchy and warm then melted in my mouth. The sweet plantains were awesome too. Service is great. The employees are friendly, and the food comes out fast. The topping bar for makes the food even better!! It's cheap too, as I paid about 10 bucks for two tacos, plantains, and a cup of beans.   I'll give this place another try, hopefully I'll have a better experience. I'll be getting takeout or delivery, since eating at the picnic tables outside is not pleasant with the noisy cars going super fast up and down the street, and containers flying away due to the wind. Not bad for Mexican/Latin food in Robinson!!"}
{"text":"This is really yummy food. Not Mexican which I loved, but there are dishes like that if you want them. Only thing is the delivery fee is $5.99 not $2.99. Will be eating here again though"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic, tacos, cheap prices... Perfect. Just, no inside seating. But we were able to eat at the counter, very friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their tacos. Ingredients are fresh and the price and service is great. Taco Tuesday 3 for $6 or 5 for $10.  They have chips and queso now but have not tried it yet. A great place to grab a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a dozen time and food is generally good, but their hours ar absurd, and delivery is a joke.  Phone is NEVER ANSWERED regardless of when you try to call...I have given up on them."}
{"text":"The fourth and final stop on the New South BBQ Tour took us to Cocina Latina - and if you've been reading my reviews for any time, you know I've been here more than once.  That means out of four stops, I've eaten at the actual restaurants three times, and in the space occupied by those restaurants all four times.  Crap!  In any case, Cocina Latina is a pretty decent Mexican restaurant, so it wasn't a bad thing that we ended our tour here (actually we ended back uptown, but we stopped eating here).  The serving at this stop was two tacos - one barbacoa (lamb) and one al pastor (pork).  The lamb wasn't bad, especially seeing as I don't really care for lamb, and the pork wasn't really bad either, seeing as I was getting full from all this eating.  What really did it in was that the typical good service at Cocina Latina was overwhelmed right then, trying to keep our chips full, and handle their normal crowd.  That, and the typical drinks they served - whatever they were - weren't really sitting well on everyone's stomach after all the others we had had, so they wanted water, which kept the staff jumping!"}
{"text":"I pass Cocina Latina on my way to work and decided to check it out today for lunch. The staff was  very friendly. I placed my order, gathered my sauces from the salsa bar, and was on my way in less than 5 minutes. The tacos were $3 each, and worth every penny. I was very pleased and will definitely be recommending them to my coworkers. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Authentic Mexican cuisine which isn't covered in sour cream or cheese. This is closer to what you'd actually find south of the border, with fresh and good ingredients. I'll be back next time I'm in the area, but they deliver too. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've eaten in awhile. If you want great service and authentic Latin food this is a great place to go to. I will be coming back here to eat."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! My family got a handful of tacos and tried carne asada, carnitas and chipotle chicken all very good! Very friendly and quick customer experience as well! Definitely will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Cocina Latina is a little hard to see since the main sign on the street is blank.  It is a take out place.  Tacos are $3.25 which is a tad more than most other taco stands in the PGH area.  The menu has burritos and a few main course items.  I ordered 3 different tacos with soft corn tortillas.  The tortillas were thrown on a grill and almost immediately turnover; so they were not warm and did not have the little crunch you expect when put on a grill for a little.  The menu list the tacos with certain toppings but the person at the counter asked me which toppings I wanted.  I had the Chipotle Chicken, Carne Asada, and Carnitas.  All were OK but the meat was not real tasty but the toppings help out."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Mexican food in Charlotte. Source: I grew up and lived 26 years in Mexico City.  The weekend barbacoa is phenomenal, just like home.  Huaraches, sopes, menudo and tortas are all great and authentic.  As for tacos, they are as authentic as you can get them in the Carolinas."}
