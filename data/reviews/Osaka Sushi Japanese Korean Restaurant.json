{"text":"Toronto roll - Looks like a mess but loaded.  - Top layer: cucumber, avocado  - Middle layer: assorted pieces of sashimi  - Bottom layer: tempura roll   Overall: Good sushi, big portions, price is decent for the quality and quantity"}
{"text":"Osaka is one of those finds that, sadly, is being found so it just keeps getting busier!  The staff are super friendly and it's nice that they are still small business-minded enough to remember us and light up when we come in...we love the warm welcome we always receive.  On to the sushi and food...yummy! Everything is made fresh, and considering in Markham there's not a whole lot of 'fresh' seafood, they do a good job of choosing their fish and making everything delicious. Love the lunch specials -- super value.  Cute decor, not super fancy. No all-you-can-eat option as far as I've seen. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here twice with family and haven't been overly impressed with the decor, service or food. The decor encompasses all the cheap Japanese type of knick knacks that make the place look extremely cluttered. They have private booths where you have to \"ring\" a bell which I find tacky. Of recently I got a spicy salmon roll which is usually a sure bet however I was presented with a gigantic deep fried mess."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with the 4 star reviews?! This place lacks quality fresh fish and is very expensive for the type of food they serve. We got a small roll combo, and legit half of it was California rolls and rolls with sweet potato in the middle. If you want better sushi, head to north York. Better prices, better fish."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went there with my girlfriend for NYE. Quality and quantity was amazing for the price we paid. We waited longer than usual since it was NYE but the servers periodically came to apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"Authentic local restaurant, the owner and staff always make sure we are comfortable.  This is our sushi goto place for Markham east area.  It can easily accommodate up to 6, but might be a challenge for 8.  Overall sashimi quality is definitely good.  Will always come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place recently and I'm really impressed.  Their crunch roll, and spicy ramen was top notch and very tasty .  Though their Service was a bit slow, it was worth the wait.   Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The menu was extensive, food came quickly after ordering, the venue is nice. Andd i really like their desserts. My fave is the deep fried banana. They also have the black sesame ice cream. 4/5 stars only because they didnt have any items that was unique."}
{"text":"I love this spot for sushi.  I admit it is not top end sushi but their sushi pizza and Toronto roll are not to be missed.  The food is good, well made and served by friendly staff.  They seem to always throw in extras when our group meets there for lunch.   Definitely try the above mentioned as well as their korean short ribs."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the quality of food hasn't been quite the same the last couple of times we visited. The ingredients seemed less fresh, the staff was less attentive, and the food seemed a lot more... generic? Even the décor had changed subtly, with unappealing advertisement papers on the table instead of the original Osaka prints and boring, generic cups instead of ones with interesting pictures. Is the store under new management?   The only things that didn't change was the price, which is now way too high for the experience.  My family and friends gave it several tries because we had been loyal customers for so long, but we all agreed that this restaurant would no longer be the go-to place for our Japanese food. Sorry, Osaka :("}
{"text":"Fresh and reasonably priced food.  I loved the sushi in my bento box dinner so much that I ordered extra sushi along with unagi hand roll and ikura sushi. My husband would definitely order the salmon teriyaki again.  The decor is charming and traditional.  Overall between the food and affable service we will definitely be back. Even willing to bring THE Japanese connoisseur of my family next time."}
{"text":"Nice Japanese food, servers are nice and friendly. Sashimi are fresh and clean. Recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriends sister and I really enjoyed going to this place for udon but today  she found a huge stink bug the size of my finger at the bottom of her udon stuck to the bowl."}
{"text":"One of the better non-ayce japanese restos in Markham. Better to make a reservation on weekends as it can get quite busy as it isn't  a very big place, and best to call ahead for take out. Sushi has always been fresh, and will make custom rolls if asked."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and I've yet to be disappointed. Awesome food, great atmosphere inside and good service."}
{"text":"I'm giving Osaka a 3 rating because of its service.  The food is definitely a 4 but I've decided to boycott this place due to its horrendous customer service.    Went for dinner around 7:30pm on a Friday night.  The place was very busy.  We stood at the front of the restaurant for a good 10-15 mins with servers walking right past us without greeting or saying anything to us.  We patiently waited for someone to acknowledge us but some people waiting behind us decided they had enough and just left.  Finally someone came and seated us.  After we ordered we had to wait over 30mins for our food to arrive.  It also took 10-15 mins to get a server to bring us our bill.    Don't get me wrong, the sushi is the best you'll find in this part of markham but the owners should seriously consider hiring more staff if they care at all about their customers.  I recommend coming here during non peak hours to avoid the rush and maybe have a better experience.  I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place for years now. Hands down its my fav place for sushi in markham. Their maki pieces are huge though, ( which isnt a bad thing...unless you mind putting the whole thing in your mouth! )"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon and scallop spicy roll and the dynamite roll. I dislike the salmon and scallop roll because the ratio of salmon and soggy fried bits of tempura was 1-10. The salmon wasn't fresh.   I went home and woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning... Vomiting and abdomen pain all night. I am pretty sure it was the sushi because for breakfast n lunch I had regular food from home.   I have been there x3 times and it never happened. But now I am never going back there again. Must be something different in the way they handle the sushi."}
{"text":"Food was okay  But horrible service  Very upset coz the waitress spread out the food on my new jacket  And just told me there is napkin on the table and didn't do anything about it  Will never go back to this restaurant and not recommend people go"}
{"text":"Def has went down in terms of service and food. The rolls used to take 2 bites to eat due to the size but now I can eat it in one bite without a problem. Service sucks because it takes them forever to acknowledge you. What's the point of the bell at the door if you don't listen for it??? Anyway, the food also takes a really long time to come. Our cooked food came in approx 15-20 mins and our sushi took 40 mins. A little ridiculous wouldn't you say?? I probably won't be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"near from my house, it's one of the best places to eat in Markham! The staff is excellent, and the food is delicious! Absolutely adore!"}
{"text":"Almost everything on special roll are very nice. Toronto roll is very nice but the fish a got was not as fresh (salmon was really good tho).  King spider roll is nice!!! And double crunchy dynamic rolls is again very nice!! Presentation is definitely also part of meal experience for me, especially for Japanese foods. Love it.  Will go back to try items other than sushi and appetizers next time."}
{"text":"Ordered a bento box for lunch. The price is decent. At a bit more than 10 dollars, you get a salad and soup. The atmosphere is very nice and quiet, just like traditional jap sushi places. We sat in one of the rooms and the waitresses checked upon us often. I would visit again for dinner to try the sashimi next time."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now. The ambience is great. They've just renovated so everything is nice and new. The decor is very Japanese looking.   Now the food. The sashimi is excellent. It doesn't come out frozen. It's sliced thickly and melts in my mouth. There is a huge selection of such rolls. All the usual favourites plus some combinations I've never seen before.   The cooked food is also good. The ramen is not bad and some of the apps are also good.   The key here is the fish. Go for the fish and you won't be disappointed. I will be going back many more times to try all those sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but customer service is below par after going there like 2-3 times a week for a month.  They will take their time to come serve you  however, they will pressure you to leave early. That's not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Recently, it's been my pleasure to have some sake with sashimi in this restaurant. It is the best sushi restaurant in east GTA. One and only thing I'm focusing in the sushi restaurant is the quality of raw fish and the quality of sashimi in this restaurant is the best. Goroke and fries are very good for side dish for beer. No need to go to downtown to have nice sashimi.   Pros : Fresh raw fish. Very delicious dishes.  Cons : Always many customers. You may have to wait for the table or it would be better to make pre-order and take-out."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my experience at this restruant so it will be a slightly lengthy review.  Came here a few weeks ago on a week end night, it was very busy and we were waiting in line behind maybe 3 others. A lady came to greet the people at the door and seemed to tell them something in broken English and left. After that the people infront of us were seated but we were basically left standing there for 10 minutes with no one there to greet us. Thankfully a younger waitress came to greet us and quickly apologized for the wait. She then sat us in a booth which was totally wicked. This place has private booths that allow you to slide the door close and the interior design of this restruant is mind blowingly amazing. It is not something you would expect before entering the store, so that was a nice surprise. We also got our menus and tea pretty quickly. The waitress with braided hair was very friendly and smiles even though they were very busy and I was very impressed with the professionalism. The young waitress with short hair was also great, she even managed to talk and say a joke and make us laugh in such a busy environment so that was also very nice.   The more disappointing part of my night was the food. We ordered the Toronto, Mango (I think it was called geisha?), and Spider roll, along with a shrimp tempura appetizer and a spicy chicken donburyi.mWhen the rolls came I was immediately amazed at the size they came in. They were huge! However I believe the size of them came at a large cost.. they broke apart immediately after I tried to grab one. I had a very hard time eating the rolls, and it was such a shame because i could not fully enjoy the taste of them. As for the shrimp tempura it was big, but came a little soggy.  The spicy chicken donburyi was very good, but it came much later and by then we were too full to eat it so we took it home.   Overall the experience was a hit and miss for me. The initial stage of service was not that great, but the waitresses were amazing and friendly. Then the food tasted good, but it fell apartment or came extremely late,  so again, very mixed feelings. Perhaps I will give this restruant another try one day to see if I can give it a better review next time."}
{"text":"I have been going to this for almost a year now but this is first time writing a review. After I tried the bluefin toro, I felt like I need to write it. It was soooo delicious and it's like melting in my mouth. I love the food and the staffs are so friendly so I love coming to this place."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner three weekends in a row.  Love this place.  Their sushi is always so fresh and they take the time to put it altogether nicely.  You should always make a reservations before heading over."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time  on mother's day because I didn't think it would be busy, and would get a table  without hassle.  It turned out to be a very pleasant experience and the food a lot better than I had expected.   I got a ramen combo and the noodle was cooked al dente, the way I enjoy it.    Would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Great maki. Lots of variety and interesting flavor combinations. Got the spicy salmon deep fried maki. It was crunchy and delicious. Minimal rice. Also got the DJ dragon roll which was very unique. Had a \"traditional\" spicy sauce and also a special spicy mustard sauce. With tempura and crab meat on top. The chicken donburi was also cooked perfectly and the veggies/rice tasted very fresh. So far the best sushi i can find in Markham"}
{"text":"One of the better Japanese restaurants I have been to.  The fish is fresh, the uni is great, bento boxes and ramen is a good bang for your buck.  They are Korean owned, but they don't give you the starter small dishes that most Korean restaurant gives as apps.  My only complaint is the the sashimi in the sushi boat were cut smaller than average, but they do give you a good variety of different sashimi.  They also have a large selection of specialty maki rolls, I particularly love their Volcano Roll, which is a super sized deluxe spicy salmon roll!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant for both dine in and take out! I been here a number of times for both and I would say that their quality of food is very consistent and great quality. Take out is ready in about 20 mins and we always order the 90 pieces of sushi and sashimi for 4 people (4 adults- 2 males and 2 females). Dine in menu is relatively similar with exception of presentation, the same tray that we ordered was presented in boat. Their rolls are amazing as well. I went there with a friend one and ordered 3 rolls and we had leftovers to take home. The only downside to this place- service is often slow, especially during rush hour, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Pretty excellent service, really friendly staff who attended to our table often. Until the end, when it took a while for the servers to come around, it was all around solid.  FOOD: Food was amazing, we loved everything we ordered including two appetizers. Highlights were the BBQ ribs and tempura.  The atmosphere was also very nice, the restaurant wasn't very loud despite being busy, and the lighting was very nice: not too dark but dim enough to be relaxing."}
{"text":"We had the 84-pce platter. Food was fresh and tasty and service was awesome from Ivana. She deserved a little extra over the 10% already included on the bill. Not sure why other reviews were negative on the service but we did not have such an experience - maybe because we were there at 6pm. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. Great service, very friendly and attentive. We ordered the dolsot bibimbap and the spicy dynamite roll. The food is really worth the price. The sushi portion was huge and I must say, it was probably the best sushi I've eaten. Ever. The bibimbap was delicious too. The egg was perfectly cooked and all the flavours were perfectly balanced. Their decor and setup is great as well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite restaurants. High quality of food. However, the service is pretty slow so do not try it if you are in a rush. Overall, we love this Japanese restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen here is absolutely second to none. I'm from Calgary and a friend of mine brought me and the g/f here diner and it was amazing. The takoyaki the and dumplings were also delicious, I recommend stopping in for a bite it's so worth it.   There was a line up and we waited for a table for about 20 minutes so be aware that it might be a bit busy and plan ahead."}
{"text":"Never disappoints ! The rolls are delicious, my favorite is the green Dragon roll and king spider roll. I like how the deep fried shrimp/ crab still taste warm when it arrives at the table. The service is very good as well."}
{"text":"Spicy Sea Food Udon  WOW this is my favorite place to have dynamite roll with spicy sea food udon.  The roll is big enough.  Spicy sea food udon has lots of sea food including muscles, big shrimps, octopus, and veggies!  There is no options about the level of spiciness but you can order this in mild, medium, or hot.  I didn't know this place was in Markham/ Unionville!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing service and food. Service was very fast and staff were friendly. Food was very good and sushi was very well done. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi place.  Kids loved the Udon noodle soup and the rolls are yummy. Portions are large. Couldn't finish bento box. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place! Got the Udon Lunch Special, #4, which had spicy salmon rolls and some gyoza on the side. I've eaten a lot of spicy salmon rolls and this is the first time I've had some that actually had some kick to it. The udon had a slice of lotus root in it too so that was a pleasant surprise! Most likely added due to the Korean side of the restaurant.  Overall, good food, good service. I would come Here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good quality and sizeable portions. Restaurant is always busy, so service is a bit challenged."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great donburi, great food overall. So far, I have never had a bad experience there. My kids love it there. The service is good and friendly, lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really wish we could have eaten here.   We were seated immediately but like someone else said, we then waited for menus, not even water or tea brought to us.   The lady who seated us did not smile or inform us when our server would be over, a waiter walked by us a few times and we didn't even get  \"I will be right with you\"  I could understand if it was busier but it was not that bad.  Very disappointed as the food ratings are so good. Based on most of the reviews I have to say I probably will return to try the food, as long as the service is better."}
{"text":"It is not apparent from the outside how great this place actually is. This is not an all you can eat place. This is an authentic Japanese sushi place.  Place and music  When you enter the restaurant, it looks like a little Tokyo. Very nice and elegant. The music is soft bossa Nova.  A perfect place for dates and a quiet conversation. The place is very clean.  Food  We ordered the amazing spider roll. The roll had a perfect proportion of rice, soft shell crab and shrimp tempura. They also put the unused part of the soft shell crab on top for you to much.  We also ordered California roll and salmon roll.  The salmon is fresh and melts in your mouth.  The ramen is pretty decent.  We got the spicy ramen  Price  The amazing spider roll cost about $15. This dish is enough for 2 person.  18 pieces of rolls combination cost $14. The spicy ramen is $8. I believe the price is reasonable for the quality and value you're getting.  Conclusion I highly recommend this place for a quality authentic Japanese experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice for lunch and we absolutely love their rolls.    We've tried their Toronto roll which looks like a mess but has so many different components that you just can't help but love it. The roll itself has shrimp and yam tempura inside but on top there is a mix of different kinds of sashimi, cucumber, crab, avocado and spicy sauces.  We also tried the King Crab roll which is delicious as well.  Inside the roll was fried soft shell crab, cucumbers, avocado.  Over the roll they put half of the fried soft shell crab over it.   I've also tried their bulgogi and teriyaki salmon bento boxes.  The boxes are ok, decent price but not outstanding.   My husband and I also like how the tables are pretty separated from each other in these self-contained booths.  The service is excellent as well.    Overall, I would definitely go back to Osaka for their rolls but not so much their bento boxes."}
{"text":"Cost: Reasonable - 85% Decor: Very good - 90% Quality: Good (sampled multiple items) - 90% Value: 85% Keeper? 100% Yes, will go back, we go there almost once a week.  We go there regularly and never leave disappointed. Staff and owner are very friendly. Enjoy the decor while you wait for your food, see how much effort was put into making this little place so comfy and eye pleasing."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants around markham/stouffville/richmondhill and osaka is still my #1 favourite place for a few reasons that I will list. I've been to osaka at least 3 or 4 times now and I've never been disappointed.   Pros: -First thing you are hit with as soon as you walk through the door is amazing decor and atmosphere. I've never been to a traditional sushi restaurant in Japan but I imagine its pretty close to this. There are two rows of wooden booths, some with sliding doors and others with a curtain, which are optional for privacy. The whole place is colourful and has a relaxing vibe. -The food quality is really good. Even those little salads they serve you first that you usually skip at other places taste really fresh. The sushi is amazing. They have a big enough menu that they probably have all your favourite rolls and special rolls, but its not so big that you get overwhelmed and have no idea what to get. (I recommend the Geisha roll, delish). The tempura is not overly flaky. At other places the panko flies all over the place when you try to pick up a piece. Their shrimp tempura is bomb. They serve it to you while its still hot. The shrimp texture is noticeably better than your run of the mill mushy/cold/slimy shrimp rings. It has bite! It has grooves where little fish muscles are supposed to be. It actually tastes like something that once swam around in the sea.  -Portion sizes are very generous. Be careful not to order too much! This place does NOT do all-you-can-eat. Pick your favourite 2 special rolls and get a dish of tempura on the side for 2 people is more than enough. (I still ate all i could eat) -Prices are at par with most other sushi restaurants  -The place is small enough that the chefs at the back can say thank you and goodbye as you leave through the front door = Character Points (I love a restaurant that maintains its intimacy and good hospitality traits, it reminds you that you are a person being served by people)   Cons:  -NO ALL YOU CAN EAT! (Which isn't necessarily a bad thing) It just means you can't over-indulge and make yourself feel sick if you don't wanna pay for it with your wallet too.  -Service is about the same as you will experience at any other sushi restaurant. They don't really go above and beyond with the service. But that's not really worth a whole star in my books, deal with it. The character points I mentioned above is the reason they keep that last star!  Osaka is about quality, not quantity (...but their portions are still pretty big). 5/5"}
{"text":"My and my girlfriend's #1 favorite Japanese restaurant in GTA! Great selection of sashimi for the 18-piece sashimi dinner. All the rolls are heavenly. Food came out quick. Décor is cozy. Price was reasonable (a bit over $20 per person after tax and tips). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Galbi ribs bento box for supper last night~ $18. It was huge & perfect! Comes with miso soup (very flavorful) & a small but refreshing lightly dressed iceberg salad. I had the toasted rice green tea, very fragrant & well-steeped and surprisingly they didn't charge me! The tempura was piping hot and crispy- the perfect mix of shrimp, zucchini, Mami squash & sweet potato topped by one giant onion ring- I must not forget to mention the deliciously brewed tempura sauce which has a curious cinnamon-y undertone which I could eat on everything it's so good!  2 small veg spring rolls on the side, a few salmon/avocado makis, assorted sushi (super fresh, buttery fish slices of tuna, salmon, butterfish & shrimp) and of course a mother load of exquisitely tender (slightly fatty) Galbi ribs, seasoned to perfection & again, piping hot. Wait staff was extremely attentive and had recommended the Galbi bento Box when I wasn't sure what I felt like having, so I have to give this place & it's food 5 stars for sure :)) super clean & cute place with inviting & authentic decor."}
{"text":"After read the reviews about this restaurant, I was excited to try the place out. I ordered dynamite roll and DJ something roll. They're no different just the topping-one is spicy, the other one is not. (I never tried such a shitty dynamite roll for the price) they're all cucumber,a little bit avocado and tempura bits... They didn't even make the roll firmly. Not even half decent.  For the price, I thought at least I get something better than food court sushi... food court or supermarket even offer same or better sushi for much less price.  If I have to find a sliver lining about this restaurant is the decoration. And you have privacy with a cabinet seat.  Personally, my husband and I won't come again. Over."}
{"text":"Great sushi and presentation. The little Japanese huts are so cute and offer privacy specially for families with young kids. The portions are enormous and hard to eat a whole roll in one bite. Salmon lovers roll and spicy tuna hand roll were both great. The Toronto roll lacked flavour and was just too disoriented in my opinion."}
{"text":"Get. The. 10pc. Salmon. Sashimi. Special. GET IT. Full stop.  But also get the spider rolls (both versions are #blessed). But also don't get the zaru soba noodles, they're eh."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3-star rating not because the food isn't good.  In fact, the food is VERY good. I had the Osaka roll and Toronto roll.. Both are amazingly good.    I'm giving 3stars because the service is really slow.  I went there on Tuesday (tho Wednesday was Canada day so I kinda felt like it was Friday).  Udon came before the salmon sashimi appetizer.  My 2 yr-old finished the udon and we still have to wait for another 10-15min to see my appetizer to arrive.  Then another 5min to see my rolls.    Waiter said there is a big sushi boat order that caused delays in sushi bar .. :( Apparently, there is only one sushi chef working that night."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a while, and I really like their special rolls. They used to have very good lunch deals but not anymore. I still come back for the special rolls, and I think they are really worth trying. Overall, nice environment, reasonable price and service. I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Ridicules waiting time for slow waiter and waitresses that don't seem to know what they are doing. Will never go back."}
{"text":"For sushi outside Japan, this place is really good. Both their ramen and nigiri create a craving effect a week after. This is the place to come back to with family, in a couple, or just friends. It is perfect for celebrating casual birthdays or having get togethers. The atmosphere and decore are friendly and interesting, and the prices are good for the quality you get.   There were four of us: two ordered ramen and two shared a sushi boat. All four were full and happy with the quality and service. Osaka's rolls are very good and did not fall apart.  Higly recomend for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Decent quality Japanese food, extremely in-expensive lunch specials and cute \"traditional\" decor. Good service, nice and clean.   The lunch special bentos were in the $7 range, an udon soup and roll for $9.95."}
{"text":"Food was really good! The sushi was very fresh, rice was made perfectly. I really like the food they have here and I would definitely return. GREAT PLACE."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese restaurant with very cute decor. Their uni was not fresh however all the other sushi/sashimi dishes were on par for a reasonably priced Japanese fare. The service is very good. If you are a connoisseur I wouldn't recommend this place but if you just want the basics this place will quell your cravings. More geared to those newer to Japanese food."}
{"text":"Flawlesss service, great price point, amazing & fresh food, thumbs up all around! My favourite and now only sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Ordered the chirashi and sushi lunch specials and a seafood nabe ubon with my friend. The fish were fresh, better quality than your regular sushi restaurants. The udon had a mix of veggies and seafood. Not bad value. Paid $50 after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Prices seem expensive at first look at the menu but when it arrives, it always exceeds my expectations. Would definitely recommend the Matsu sushi which had 13 pcs of sushi and 12 pcs of maki. The sushi was perfectly made and it was clearly fresh. It came with a great assortment of different fish for $24.99. Enough for two."}
{"text":"Best jap/Korean restaurant in markham hands down. I eat there weekly and don't bother looking elsewhere because the food is so good."}
{"text":"I quite like the sashimi and rolls at Osaka, but what I like most is their lunch combos where you can get udon and a roll for $10-15! It's a good deal considering sometimes they cost that much individually."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially their lunch special. Yummy food, good portion at reasonable price. Their deep fried items are always super crunchy! My favorite lunch order - Dynamite Roll or Tempura Bento. The chicken cutlet is huge and crunchy as well!!"}
{"text":"The wait times sometimes takes forever but the actual food tastes amazing and the sushi pieces are HUGE one maki roll is filling enough on its own"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and my wife and I decided to give this place a go seeing the crowds outside the door all the time. Typical Korean-run Japanese shop in Toronto (ala Gal's, Moto, etc.) I'm a sushi snob that sticks to the true Japanese-run fare, but I was surprisingly okay with Osaka. Clean and fish was decent, I'd come back if I was craving and couldn't get out to the legit shops in Toronto. Service was superb and everyone was very professional. Uni and Salmon were surprisingly good (both sashimi and nigiri), Tuna and Hamachi was a little dehydrated. Overall good experience and might come back."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! wasn't crowded when we went so it was nice.  We went here for lunch and we had our fill with awesome sushi rolls.  their selection and descriptions in the menu were helpful and made it easy to choose. my friends got the bento box and a ramen. It looked alright but I'm glad I got rolls and a chirashi to share with my other friends. sushi was fresh and delicious and not overwhelmed with sauce or anything.  sushi is expensive as always. But it was really tasty!"}
{"text":"Second time here and definitely enjoyed the food again. I highly recommend. This time we ordered a Spicy Volcano Roll and Spicy Beef Ramen. Both had a nice kick of spice and recommend them for those who enjoy a little heat. This evening was definitely busy and the two servers were overwhelmed, however they managed to provide adequate service. Presentation of the dishes is great and wait times for food were within reason. Will be coming back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Love it here! Their specialty rolls are really what keeps me coming back...  Service is decent and food does not take too long to come out.   One roll in particular I would like to point out would be the Toronto roll, this includes many layers, which include vegetables, sashimi and tempura.   ALSO, their ramen is quite good as well and has many different varieties.  Overall, I love this place and recommend you all to give it a try too!!  Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Markham. I always get the Toronto roll or the geisha roll. It's a bit pricey for 8 pieces but the sizes are huge and they aren't stingy on the ingredients."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a regular walk-in dinner. Didn't have any expectations and whatsoever. Amazingly, this became the place I would recommend my friends to have a rest and a beautiful dinner. Very very decent service. Expensive but worth the cost!"}
{"text":"Somehow the chefs were changed I guess, the food was not that great anymore..  may not go back again."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best sushi places I've been. The rolls are ginormous and you definitely get your bang for your buck. The food is also super delicious. If you're a person that doesn't eat much but still love sushi and want to save money instead of going to AYCE and not eating your worth, this restaurant is definitely for you. Yummy and 100% worth it."}
{"text":"this is as good as it gets when it comes to sushi! perfection with every bite, you definitely get your money's worth here! the servers are extremely nice which is refreshing for a sushi place and the decor is absolutely outstanding. had a spectacular experience here! i recommend getting the rolls as they are pretty special!   must have sushi roll : the french kiss!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  This place was my go to place when I lived in markham area!!  Everything was so yummy.  Especially their sushi rolls are so great.  I usually had ikayaki which is grilled squid and takoyaki which is octopus ball as an appetizer.   And as a meal I used to order osaka special roll which is torched scallop on top of roll, salmon lover roll and toronto roll.   Their rolls are so well made and packed with fresh stuff inside so I can tell the chefs are super professional!  They have great variety of roll kinds it is another great fun to pick whatever I feel and crave.   Also they have kalbi which is korean BBQ short rip I think that is best quality and taste in markham area.  Best Japanese I have had in markham& richmond hill area!!  Staff was super friendly, fast and attentive.  It is busy restaurant but server and the owner always checked up on me if everything is okay.  They have spacious parking lot as well that is another plus:)  And their sushi party tray on the menu looked like very great deal so good priced.. I think it would be great for party and family dinner meal.  I miss them so much and look forward to visit this again when I have a chance to go to Markham area:)"}
{"text":"Excellent place for Sushi! Ya so what it's not AYCE but the service, quality, the love oh and did I mention the service? We went on a Sunday lunch and a Wednesday dinner and both times the food was awesome! I will never eat at another AYCE again! Their food is always sub-par, absolutely no service, and no love.. Is place is everything I love about spending my hard earn money!"}
{"text":"They're food is decently priced depending on what item you get.  And the quality does not suffer over quantity!"}
{"text":"Since my usual go to sushi place closed down, we've been looking at alternatives. A friend recommended Osaka, and it did not disappoint.   The booths are super cute, and are equipped with a call button that beckoned the friendly staff to our table. We got the Toronto Roll, Salmon Lover's Roll and a salmon sashimi special of 10 pieces for $11.95.   We were happy with the quantity of food (sushi leftovers are never as tasty so we would probably order a bit less). Impressed with the Toronto Roll, which was an impressive mound of food that we would gladly order again. The Salmon Lover's Roll was just OK and would pass on ordering again so that I could try different rolls."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Toronto Roll, Salmon Lover, Osaka Roll, Sushi Boat   || Rating: (9/10) Food, (7/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (7/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    A real authentic Japanese spot located in Markham, has some of the most delicious and unique rolls around. Some might argue that real Japanese restaurants don't focus on rolls, but rather on sashimi, it really comes down to what you want to eat and if a place satisfies that craving.   First, the rolls here are HUGE, they do not skimp out on the rolls at all. This is not saying there's a ton of rice with a couple bits of fillers, no, the overall rolls is perfectly balanced, but massive in size. My particular favourite in-house specials would be the Toronto Roll, which is a giant roll topped with a giant amount of chopped sashimi, and the Osaka Roll, named after the establishment. The overall quality of fish is very consistent and fresh.   The service here can be on and off at times. When it isn't too busy, they are very attentive and efficient. However, the few experiences I had during peak ours (dinner service), the service has been a bit sporadic, with a number of empty uncleaned tables and a long line of eager customers. This is not entirely their fault, but more on management to ensure better turn over and to not lose potential customers."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi joint in Markham!  I've been to Osaka Sushi plenty of times and it never disappoints. The quality of the food is amazing and the service is top notch.  Whenever I go, I usually order their special rolls which range between $10-17 depending on which ones you get. Each speciality roll comes with around 10 pieces. It seems expensive on paper BUT these rolls are MASSIVE. Seriously.. they're like sushi on steroids. My favourite special rolls are: Salmon and Spicy Scallop Roll, Gold 888, and the Spicy Orange Dragon Roll.   I used to think a-la-carte sushi wasn't worth it but the quality you get here is sooo much better than ayce. I'm a fairly big eater but I'm full after eating 1 and a half of these special rolls. So in the end, its actually cheaper than ayce sushi.  If you're in Markham and you're feeling sushi, definitely hit up Osaka!"}
{"text":"Great if you plan on only ordering sashimi, skip if you're looking for sushi. Their salmon roll was clearly a day old sushi that they've prepared the night before.   Their lunch udon set is great - well, at least the udon was. Very generous portions and had many toppings, very much like the traditional Japanese udon.   Friendly and attentive staff - even as we sat in a booth, we had a buzzer and the staff checked up on us quite regularly despite it being extremely busy in the afternoon.   This is a mixed review as the sushi side of me did enjoy this experience whereas the sashimi side did. If you're looking for a place to eat both then you can find something better elsewhere."}
{"text":"For those of you who like quality sushi but also like big portions, Osaka Sushi is the place for you.    Going into the nondescript mall, you are greeted by an old school Japanese restaurant interior with wooden booths.  I ordered the Toronto Roll, as per my friend's recommendations.  Our group also got the Salmon roll, and two bento boxes.  Never have I seen such generous portions on a sushi roll.  The tempura and yam based roll is easily twice as thick as a standard Japanese restaurant roll, and is topped with huge chunks of tuna, salmon, and whitefish, all with a drizzling of salmon roe, spicy mayo and topped with avocado.  I walked away stuffed from just the one sushi roll, and the meal also included free miso soup and salad.  Other rolls and the bento boxes were similarly sized, with the salmon teriyaki being twice the size of a normal portion as well.  Would not hesitate to bring friends here to get stuffed again."}
{"text":"A friend and I were here today on a Sunday for lunch. Selection is overwhelmingly huge, but in a good way. It's more expensive here for most rolls but they were bigger than we expected and also really delicious. We ordered the Double Dynamite Crunch Roll and the Salmon & Spicy Scallop Roll. Ingredients tasted really fresh. Would recommend.  The servers were always very quick to check in on us and ask if we needed anything. Food arrived really promptly too.   The interior really has that Japanese touch and also has private room seating. It was a nice, quaint space to have a meal and catch up."}
{"text":"It's incredibly tasty (both my husband I had one of their hot pot soups).  It's full of a variety of fresh ingredients, put together with genius.  And it's not too salty or greasy - dare I say, homemade quality??  I'm NOT a good judge of Asian food, but my husband worked in Markham for at least 10 years and so has tried almost every restaurant up and down the area, on a daily basis for lunch/after work dinner.  He agreed it's one of his favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Love the decor, I had the amazing spider roll, nicely seasoned, really tasty and they do give you the whole soft shell crab. The reason for three star is that It was $19, I think it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for lunch on a weekday.  Love their udon lunch specials for about $11 which includes udon and one of roll/handroll/etc.  The food is always great, my only complaint is that it's sometimes near impossible to get service here.  The waiters rarely walk by and check on you and if you've drank your cup of tea then you're likely not going to your cup refilled.  They do have a little bell in some of the booths which you can use to ask for a waiter to come by, but it isn't available for all tables and booths.  The tables here for 4-6 people at best - they don't have any tables that can cater to a larger group."}
{"text":"I ordered a chirashi with rice. It has a variety of different kinds of fish and they are fresh and good. Besides the fish, there's plenty of rice on the side and the rice is well seasoned."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to place for amazing sushi in Markham. The restaurant itself if quite small and feels cramped. Therefore usually is always a line up around dinner time.   The staff always warmly welcomes me here and are very attentive which is amazing and are helpful in regards to an inquiries I have about my orders.   There specialty rolls are more on the pricier side and can range from $15-22 but they are huge! I can never ever finish a full roll by myself! Thus a rolls is sufficient enough for 2 people. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out sushi after reading some good reviews.  For the price and what you're getting it wasn't so great.  Another Japanese restaurant in the area offered Toro in their sushi/sashimi tray and their price were a little lower too.  The quality is good but our takeout order was given very little soy sauce.  For their largest tray (92 pcs) of take out sushi they gave us enough soy sauce for 4 people.  At least ask how many people we have and give more if needed but you'd expect more since it's not an expensive item to give out.  The amount of cutlery was also lacking... not enough chopsticks for everyone that we ordered for."}
{"text":"If you're going to get one thing from this restaurant, it must be the sashimi. This restaurant has probably the most thickest cut and delicious variety of sashimi I've ever tried. We've been here twice and both times we've gotten a sashimi platter to share. Everything else is good too but not quite as good."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night with my girlfriend around 8:30pm for dinner after reading some good reviews about this place.   When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by how authentic the decor and atmosphere is, so we had a good feeling about this place.   Anyways, we were standing for about 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us to ask how many people we were. Thankfully when we were approached, the wait wasn't too long.   We sat down and quickly ordered. It took another 10 minutes before we were served any tea.   My girlfriend ordered sushi and I ordered a shoyu (soya sauce) ramen with beef. Her order came without 10 minutes and my ramen was still not here. By the time she was 80% done her food, that's when my ramen came. And it was not what I expected at all. First off, they didn't have a ramen spoon, you simply cannot eat ramen without a ramen spoon. Also, the soup base literally tasted like they cracked open a package of seasoning from a pack instant noodle. The egg yolk was not runny in the middle like it should be. There were no garnishes such as seaweed and corn which I absolutely love. I managed to eat everything since I was so hungry but it wasn't my best experience with ramen.   My girlfriend asked for the bill next and to our surprised it came within 15 seconds. And that concludes my review."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night and the place was relatively busy. We have gone to this place a few times in the past. We were promptly seated and given a cup of green tea.  We ordered the Chirashi and Nabe Seafood Udon. The prices at this restaurant are probably a bit above average given the quality. The fish in the Chirashi was good and the portion size was decent. The udon was definitely below average, and I was quite disappointed in the seafood and also the presentation.  Service is quite slow, which may be due to being understaffed. It took a good 10 minutes to get our bill. Given the number of sushi restaurants in Markham, this one will probably fall down a few spots on the list of ones that I will go to."}
{"text":"The BEST lunch specials. I always get the osaka udon + spicy salmon roll $11.95.  Service is a little slow so be patient..."}
{"text":"I've gotta thank Yelp for introducing me to this place. I was visiting my parents in Markham, and looking for some sushi to go with our traditional fish dinner on Christmas Eve. Osaka popped up on my phone, and I phoned in an order of one of their sushi platters. A few hours later, we were able to pop by and pick it up with no problems. Lots of parking, and they take credit cards, and the staff were friendly as well (free pop with our order, and lots of chopsticks and soy sauce :). To the good part - the sushi! SO GOOD. You would never guess it from this hole in the wall, but it did not disappoint. So good that we ordered the same thing the next time I went to visit :) Lots of rolls and sushi options, quick service, and good prices. A new family favourite for sure."}
{"text":"Foods are fresh. Service is decent and my order arrived pretty quickly. Not much to complain about. Everything is slightly above average but not quite \"excellent\" per se."}
{"text":"We ordered the Gold88 special roll with gold flakes sprinkled on top of a salmon roll, a small combo platter, gyoza, and takoyaki. Quality of sushi was pretty good and fresh although I personally would not order the gold 88 again - the gold flakes is a bit extra and doesn't really change the taste (not worth it). Only downside was service. We waited a very long time for the small platter even though it was a weeknight. I'd be willing to try it again in the future."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice and cozy. We aren't huge sushi eaters but do love going for the teriyaki steaks & salmon. The portion were generous and the prices are very good. We had our kids with us ages 3&4 and they scarfed everything down. We were seated in a semi private section which was also very nice since it felt like we had our own space. Would highly recommend for date night or out to eat as a family.  Tip: Make a reservation as they get very very busy and wait times could be up to an hour. Reason I gave 4 stars is because they \"lost\" our reservation even though we had called maybe 2 hours prior and the person at the front told me I didn't make a reservation even though she didn't even go and check her computer. Once she did we got our table promptly."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not going to lie, the food here was delicious and matched at a fairly good price, however the service is absolutely horrendous, never in my life have I ever wait 30 minutes before the first item arrived.  It took around an hour before we finally received everything we ordered which only included 5 items.  Alright, so I decided to give them another chance, but it turned into an awful decision that I regret, 20 minutes of just waiting to get water, but not without reminding the staff a couple times.  Overall, I think I'll just stick with cooking at home, because this was defiantly not worth the time."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in a strip mall in east markham. Food is good  atmosphere is good. It is a little pricey, otherwise I would give them a 5 star.  Was Very busy during lunch on weekend."}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3.5 stars  Location/Service A bit east of Markville, it's in a small plaza with a huge Shoppers Drug Mart - plenty of parking available.  Inside has a traditional Japanese/Korean restaurant theme - with small rooms for bigger groups of people, having a very homey feeling to it. Service was relatively fast and easily to prompt with the bell by the table. Staff were also very nice.  Food Came here with a party of 8 - so we ordered a Sashimi/Sushi Boat and a few dishes. The fish quality was above average, better than what I expected (hence, it is a little pricer). The sushi was also good - not heavy loaded with rice and a smaller portion of the fish.  We also tried the Ikayaki, which is an appetizer of BBQ grilled squid and sweet sauce. The sauce was a bit too much in my opinion, so a little too sweet. But the squid was soft and chewy.  The other dish was a Korean one (can't remember the exact name), but it's chicken serve on top of a hot plate with veggies. The dish was pretty spicy for me and a little too oily. It did compliment well with the rice provided.  I've read a lot of reviews for this place and had expectations. The quality for sure was there, but everything else seem to be lacking a little bit. But I wouldn't mind coming by again as it's perfect for groups or a small family dinner. I'm also interested to try other items on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and it's my favorite non ayce sushi restaurant.   Ramen base has delicious flavor and depth.  Sushi is really fresh.  Price is almost same as ayce but you get better quality and still full."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. Not the same, maybe new ownership over the past year. Just average sushi joint now..."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and love the sushi.  Each table around the edges is like a Japan inspired cubicle, with woodwork and fancy screens to separate you from the other diners. It gives your dining party a more private experience.  The sushi is great. Amazing presentation. I tried the kamikaze roll, I'm knocking off a star simply because the pieces of the roll were GIGANTIC!  But who cares, it tasted amazing.  They even gave us some extra mayo on the side. YUM.  Plenty of parking in that plaza with no frills and shoppers drug mart. Be sure to make a reservation if you're coming during peak hours!   Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Osaka is tucked away in a tiny plaza, so it can easily be missed if you're not deliberately looking for it! The interior of the restaurant is actually bigger than I had expected and feels very cozy with dim lighting. It's made up of several traditional Japanese-style rooms for larger groups and a bunch of smaller tables in the main seating area. I came for lunch and ordered a salmon teriyaki bento with a side of their uni sushi special (2 pieces). My boyfriend had their salmon chirashi. The portions were generous and food quality was pretty good. Overall it's a decent Japanese/Korean restaurant but I probably won't be back unless I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"Good food is one thing but bad to poor customer service is another. This is the second time we had to wait 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us that we are waiting to get seated. They close at 10:30pm. But they want to stop taking business at 8:45pm. The waitress there all try to ignore and pretend they don't see you standing there. Just don't expect any type of customer service if you eat here."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Food is ok but the service is way below average.  They took time to take our orders but when we finished, they took no time to give us the bill."}
{"text":"Came here again after awhile, realized how expensive it is and not quite worth it.   I ordered the sashimi lunch special bento box $13.99 ... That was nothing special and not quite the deal.  Also ordered spicy dynamite roll which was $11 wasn't anything special either..   Well anyway I'm probably not gonna be back just cause I could probably get the same stuff for cheaper. The quality  was just meh...    I ended up paying $30.. For lunch that didn't fill me up..  *note: they sell takoyaki for $6.95*"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to review this restaurant since I don't eat seafood and it's mainly a sushi restaurant, but I really enjoyed it, so why not?   This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it's divided up by screens and wooden booths. It's very cozy and looks great.  The service is exceptionally friendly and quick. Very helpful!  I had the beef teriyaki, which was very good, as was the miso soup and the salad. It was some of the best teriyaki I've ever had and the portion sizes were HUGE! We had to get doggy bags.  My wife had sushi and she was very impressed.  We definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"Osaka Sushi at Highway 7 and Galsworthy is a definite HIT in the Markham area.   Food: With a very extensive menu and plenty of Japanese and Korean dishes to choose from, everyone will definitely find something they'd like. Their signature dishes would have to be their speciality sushi rolls and they have SOO many to choose from. Each roll is HUGE, so you'll have plenty to share. I've tried the donburi as well and the portion was very generous and the food arrived piping hot to the table. One thing I really like is how they take in pride in plating each dish so its beautiful, they include plenty of garnishes which make most dishes very Snapchat/Insta worthy! Prices are also fairly decent considering you get huge portions and a miso soup / salad with most main dishes.  Service: There is a bell at each table once pressed, will beckon to the waiter/waitress that you need something. Other than taking your order at the beginning of your meal, they don't really bother to come by. Some people may see this as a bad thing but I like the privacy. When you need something, just press the bell and they'll come over right away. Other than that, enjoy your meal in peace.  Restaurant Atmosphere: There are cute little booths along the side wall that are very private since they include little curtain coverings at the door to cover them up. If you'd like a lot of privacy, you can draw the curtains at the booth and no one will be able to see you and vice versa. There are also normal tables at the restaurant in case you don't want to sit at a booth.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in February, with vastly different experiences.   For my first visit, we ordered the Kalbi lunch box and Toronto Roll. I figured $11.99 for Kalbi was a good deal since it's usually a premium item at other restaurants. But the roll that it comes with is a yam roll, not a california roll. I used my yam roll to compliment the fish from the Toronto roll. The Toronto roll is actually great. I like to think of it as a chirashi on a salmon roll instead of rice. It's their most expensive roll, but for good reason.   My second visit, we ordered a kalbi bento, a salmon bento, and an udon combo (comes with california roll). I don't know what happened during this visit, but the service was non-existent. We didn't get any service... no tea, no spoons or even soya sauce. Why would they serve udon without a spoon? Or a california roll without soya sauce? Asking them for these things took forever. The spoon took so long to come, that I had to personally walk to the front of the restaurant to get one. The lady took a dirty spoon, wiped it with a nearby towel and gave it to me. I re-wiped it with a napkin and tea when I got back to my table. As for the food, the salmon bento wasn't worth the money, nor was the udon. Udon came with just veggies, crab meat, a fish ball and naruto.   AYCE sushi in Markham/Scarborough for lunch is $14.99-$16.99. It's hard to justify coming to an a la carte sushi for the same amount of money but with worse service and similar quality of food. I can't recommend this place unless you stick with the rolls (try Toronto roll) only."}
{"text":"ordered the bbq eel roll x2 a spicy tuna roll and assorterd tempura for take out. busy parents trying to do something fun for valentines day evening.   when i got home 10 minutes later, the first thing we noticed was a strong canned tuna like odor. when it comes to raw fish, you should not feel like its smelly..thats a  bad sign. the rice had no flavour and the nori wrap was very stretchy and also had a strong seaweed odor. the spicy tuna came with a strip of spicy sauce that looked like a strip of ketchup (to get a visual sense). our bbq eel roll had no taste and we could tell had been previously frozen. oh! and they went ahead and douced it with soy sauce themselves.. ughhsjsj.   all on all we live sushi, but would easily travel to the city, for even higher priced menu items for the xomfort of knowing our food isnot going to gross us out or potentially make us sick. needless to say we had a few bites but didnt come close to finishing.   tempura was deep fried in a thick non traditional batter that became very soggy and had no flavour.   not impressed at all. they did have a great customer service presence. but we will absolutely not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Reviews are over-rated.  The location itself is within an old run-down strip mall with a shoppers drug mart. We came in to this establishment on Monday evening; surprised that the restaurant was so empty during dinner service.  We gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt due to the \"amazing\" yelp reviews and asked for seating for two.  We ordered the appetizer uni sushi (2 pcs), spider king roll, salmon lover roll and a miso ramen.  The total came to $55 without tips, which to a lot of people would agree is over priced - especially, after the meal, the quality is very under performing. Going into detail: (pictures also provided below) The plating of the food was aesthetically pleasing, but do not be fooled - there is no beauty on the inside of the food.  (1) Uni Sushi - The uni itself was very small in its size, but the biggest issue was that it did NOT taste fresh at all.  Pricing at $6.50 was extremely over priced.  (2) Miso Ramen - I should not have trusted a Korean family owned \"sushi\" restaurant to make good ramen.  The miso broth had no taste, the cha siu resembled a small piece of bacon, and noodles like plastic.  I would not be surprised if I saw the store owners walking over to the noFrils supermarket, which is conveniently located right beside the restaurant, and getting all their ingredients there. This dish honestly tasted really cheap, but priced at $12.  (3) Salmon Lover's Roll - The first thing you will notice about these \"sushi\" rolls is that the size is huge.  One piece of sushi is about 10cm in diameter, this is not sushi, should really call it a slice of a sushi burrito....  The Salmon filling inside was heavily sauced with spicy mayo.  I question the freshness of this roll at this point, one from the experience of the Uni sushi, but also because the salmon was so heavily sauced up that you really could not tell if the salmon was fresh or not.  Your jaws will be stretched and hurting after eating the first few pieces. Priced at $15  (4) King Spider Roll - I was excited to get this since I am a big lover of soft-shelled crab, but this dish really ruined my experience.  Again, the size of this \"sushi\" was HUGE.  They did not create sushi, it was a monster sushi burrito sliced horizontally.  The soft-shell crab itself was a huge disappointment, the dish itself was so over-fried that it was like burnt fish sticks.  What a way to destroy not only the dish, but sushi. For individuals who say that \"bigger the sushi, the more value for your buck\"... well, sushi is not suppose to be eaten like that... It a savory dish, that should be eaten in a single bite without needing two hands just so you can stuff it inside your mouth - I see yelp reviews saying that they love the big size of the sushi. no no no.  (5) Dessert (half an orange sliced) - The bill came with a complementary half slice of orange - let just say it was sour and the quality was... we did not finish it.  Note: The korean owners (especially the male servers) were creepy at times.  They would walk by and very slowly stare at me and my lady friend with... it was just a really creepy look.   We will not be coming back to this restaurant again, hoping to provide this review so you may not regret your experience as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I'd say its quaint décor and atmosphere is what makes it a better dining experience than I would otherwise give it credit for.  Ordered the Red Dragon Roll, Chicken Donburi and a Chicken teriyaki bento box. It was quite busy on a late Tuesday night so we had to wait a bit for our table. Eventually a table was cleared for us, but we ended up getting an awkwardly large round table for just the 3 of us. Service was kind of slow...it took a while for the server to bring us tea, another while to come take our orders, and even longer for the food to come out. There were a few mix ups with multiple servers bringing us the same drinks and the wrong dishes.  The food itself was decent, though nothing special. The donburi was not exactly as I imagined it would be from the picture on the menu, but it was still good. Could've used more complex flavoring and texture. The dragon roll was great, but the pieces were huge and difficult to eat (falls apart easily, can't really eat it in one bite). The bento box contained some good, crisp tempura; the sushi was fine. Would still come back to enjoy a meal with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Found this place here on Yelp with a 4 stars rating, gave it a try since it was on my way, but am very disappointed after spending $70+ for 2 people. Ordered takeout from this place, the food is nowhere close to being authentic. The rolls (Toronto and king spider) were way too big with oversized ingredients, and the avocado was stale tasting, definitely not worth the $16 price tag. I'd rather have unauthentic AYCE Japanese food."}
{"text":"This is a good place for sushi. Big parking lot with a lot of space. The store does get quite busy so there may be a bit of a wait depending on when you come.  The food is good quality at reasonable prices. Give it a try."}
{"text":"FOOD: 3.5/5 - I usually come here when I need a quick fix of sushi. From the Eastern side of Markham, this is the nicest option there is available for Japanese food. There are lots of variety and options in their menu from Japanese bentos to Korean dishes, there's guaranteed something that will suite your liking. Although Osaka isn't comparable to higher end Japanese restaurants in terms of quality but you get the best bang for your buck. Their fish and ramen are decent enough to satisfy your cravings. And I like that they'd give you a little orange at the end of your meal.  SERVICE: 3.5/5 - it's usually very packed at night on the weekends unless you go early like 6pm. Service could also be slow at times because of the amount of traffic they get and usually not enough staff around.   ATMOSPHERE: 4/5 - The restaurant looks like a traditional looking Japanese eatery. You'll see curtains, drums and ancient paintings as decor around the space. They could accommodate large groups in a private area or smaller group in the closed booth.  OVERALL RATING: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Had Friday night takeout and ordered the eel, gold salmon, and scallop rolls for 3 and they were delicious and more than filling for adults.  Busy so make sure to call ahead"}
{"text":"Amazing to say the least. I just ordered take out for the first time, Salmon teriyaki dinner bento box and Spicy Dragon roll. They were both absolutely delicious. It cost $30, but I'd say definitely they give quality food. The specialty roll is especially delicious, loaded with filling and very little rice. The tempura kind of softened by the time I reached home,  but that's a given. Even the miso soup which regularly I pass was quite delicious. I had placed my order and arrived half hour later. The place was packed and 3 ppl in line waiting to get a seat. My order was ready to take home and enjoy. Can't wait to go for a dine in. **EDIT** Just went there for a dinner party last night with 14 ppl. The place was insanely tight, but then they moved out the extra table setting there and we could space out with more room. Everyone loved the food, ethnic environment was great, service was efficient. An absolute must for Japanese cuisine lovers !!!"}
{"text":"Calling all sushi lovers! This place is fantastic both in terms of service and quality of food!   Came here for lunch on a weekday; my friend and I each ordered a \"special roll\" - I got the Green Dragon Roll (yes, I am one of those foodies currently on that avocado craze), and my friend ordered the Spicy Salmon Roll. Both were delicious/tasted fresh, and came with a small salad and miso soup.   SPECIAL ROLL: Green Dragon Roll *RECOMMEND* Green dragon rolls are one of my favourites, and this roll did not disappoint! The portion sizes were massive (I'm not exaggerating - one sushi was nearly the size of my palm) - and it wasn't because there was a lot of rice on the sushi. Rather, they seemed to be very generous with the avocados, cucumbers and tempura shrimp in each sushi! (Yay!) Plus, the dressing on top of the sushi was a delicate balance between sweet and spicy (wasabi) which was different (in a good way!)  SPECIAL ROLL: Spicy Salmon Roll *RECOMMEND* As someone that does not typically eat raw salmon, I am surprised to say that I would highly recommend this dish! The crunch from the tempura bits in each sushi added a great textural component to the otherwise softer texture from the raw salmon and rice. This sushi was quite spicy though - so have a glass of tea or cold water on hand!   SERVICE: It may have been because the place was relatively empty (lunch on a weekday), but whenever we needed something (and pressed the service button in the booth), someone would come right away. All the servers we had were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Picked up takeout.   Ordered the Gold 888 roll and an order of veggie tempura, came to $28 and change with tax. I had thought that it was a little expensive until I picked up the takeout bag and it felt like a lot of food.   Even thought it was a takeout order, all of the staff were very polite and said goodbye to me on my way out. Minor detail but it was appreciated.   The roll was huge (as other reviewers have mentioned). I believe it had 10 pieces. The pieces were so large that they were difficult to grip and consume in one bite, it was delicious nonetheless. The roll and tempura easily could have fed two mid sized appetites, if anything just add on some sashimi or a classic roll such as the spicy salmon to ensure you are full.   The order came with a miso soup which was generic but good nonetheless. Unfortunately the tempura was soft by the time i got home but that it normal considering it was a take out order.   I highly recommend the rolls."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice, once with a single friend and the other with several friends, both for dinner, and wasn't disappointed.  Fairly friendly staff, although not exactly the most active. The place had a nice feel, I liked how everything looked; added a slightly authentic atmosphere. As for Korean food, portions were pretty good, and the variety was decent. Sushi was alright, could be better. A bit on the pricey side for me, but if you're alright with that, I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent, it was our first time having dinner after Easter Church. We went to so many Japanese \"Sushi\" restaurants..and never try the close one near our home. It's a good experience. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came during lunch time to buy take-out. It was pretty quiet but from reading other reviews, I think it gets packed during dinner. I got the salmon teriyaki bento box. I found it a bit pricey for what I got in my box. The rice, salad, and noodles were literally only a few bites, with 3 pieces of yam sushi, but it came with a decent size piece of salmon. Staff were really nice and gave me a glass of water while I waited for my food. I expected a bit more."}
{"text":"Googled this place as a last minute option.   Service is non existent here, had to wait forever to get a menu after being seated, and then another wait time for ordering. Saw many other tables experiencing the same level of service.   Not overly impressed with the taste of their food. A lot of items they made look exceptionally fancy, although the flavours just weren't there. It didn't stand out of the AYCE or A la carte sushi restaurants I've been too.   The menu is packed with options, as if it were an inventory list for a store, so when you come here I'd suggest looking at their menu online before hand to get an idea ! It can get a little confusing and overwhelming at times to decide out of all the choices.   For price point I would say it is on the pricier side especially for the taste and quality of food. Their rolls range from 10-18$ and the sashimi is probably 1-2$ more above avg a la carte.   Freshness is important as well, the sashimi I found wasn't the freshest, some slimier than normal pieces had been given which is a big NO when you want to eat sushi.   Pick your food wisely and hope that the day you go is when they're serving the freshest new delivery of fish !"}
{"text":"One of our favourite restaurants.  We rarely frequent this style of restaurant because it's not our most desired cuisine, but everything about this place is perfect.  The owner and staff are unbelievably friendly and welcoming.  Interior is spotless and has a great setting.  On to the good stuff, cheap sake!  Having a beautiful tray of fresh sushi is made even better when you catch a serious buzz off sake.  Everything we've had here has been spectacular, bulgogi, spicy ramen, and my personal favourite, the bbq rib meat.  The pricing here is unbeatable for flavour and portion size.  Can't recommend it enough.  The worst part about this place is deciding what to have."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little restaurant in Markham, the owners are very polite and nice along with the entire staff. The fish is really fresh and their rolls are tasty - you get a huge serving and unlike most sushi places they don't over stuff the roll with rice, it's all fish and fillers. I love the fact that they actually get creative with their rolls such as the Gold 888 which even has gold flakes on top of the roe. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to have sushi for dinner and didn't feel like going to an izakaya so we decided on Osaka.  We were greeted and led to our table immediately when we entered the restaurant. I was surprised how busy the restaurant was at 6:15pm on a Wednesday!  We ordered the Matsu Sushi platter that came with 13 pieces of sushi and 12 pieces of rolls ($24.95).  On the wall, they had a 10pc salmon sashimi special for $10.95, so we ordered that too.  We also got 3 pieces of uni sashimi for $6.95 and an order of edamame beans for $3.95.  Everything tasted really fresh and we thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered.  If I had to make one negative comment about the food, it would be that the edamame beans were heavily salted.  Service for the most part was awesome.  The gentleman, who I think is the owner, came over to us when the uni sashimi arrived and explained to us that because they were not able to bring in their usual BC uni, they served us uni from another region.  He later on came back to our table to follow up to see if we liked the uni.  Unfortunately, due to his accent and my horrible listening to accent skills, I wasn't able to figure out what region this uni is from.. The only negative comment I have regarding the service was that it took them a while to refill my water glass.  To end, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I had shashimi (30 pieces) and tried the bluefin tuna which were very sweet and juicy.  The other fishes were very fresh and portions were excellent.  The experience was wonderful and enjoyable"}
{"text":"Upon reading so many great reviews of this place, I thought I'd give it a try.  I am glad to say that it did not disappoint!  Just walking through the door I loved the atmosphere.  Decorated in an obvious Japanese way, and the tables/booths allow for privacy.  Because of this, however, it doesn't look like it seats too many people.  I wasn't there during a peak period but I could definitely understand why some people complain about waiting.  The service was great!  We had a very polite and attentive server.  Just perfect.  The food was fantastic as well.  I got a tempura bento box and my sister got a chicken cutlet donburi (rice bowl).  We also shared an order of gyoza (dumplings).  The tempura was quite filling and the batter was fairly light.  I was also surprised at the quantity and how filling it was.  Only a few very minor complaints. - While the fish was very fresh, I'd like a little more fish on my sushi.  Typically, the best sushi has a higher fish to rice ratio.  Still good though. - My sister really liked the donburi but wished there was a bit more egg and fewer bean sprouts. - Finally, they ran out of takoyaki.  My sister was very disappointed that she didn't get to try them.  Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my dinner.  Great food and a great experience.  I would like to rate them 4.5 stars but given the lack of partial stars, I'm happy to give them 5/5 even with my very minor gripes."}
{"text":"Best. Fresh. Great service and ambience. Love this place. I highly recommend this wonderful place."}
{"text":"No reservation on a weekend dinner. We arrived at 640pm. A few people are already at the door waiting for table. We didn't make reservation and just went for a bite.  The server was efficient and took down our name . We waited about 20 minutes  even the 7pm people made reservation they still were told to wait. So I think it didn't make much difference if u have small party under 5.   We were seated by 710pm and were advised to return table by 815pm. Our food was ready promptly. The server took our order was oil is and the owner also helped out. Their foods never disappoint us. Their recent new menu adds some more special rolls. Tonight we tried a new item called healthy diet rolls. Its very good. Sushi rolls with No RICE. Tastes good good good....triple good.  The fishes are fresh and lots of green around the rolls.   We also had sake, and one order of uNI and two orders of sake (sashimi)  .  :) we had a full dinner and they don't rush our time at all. They were pleasant and always with smile so overall our dinning experience has made it peaceful and joyful.  All these little things and factors increased appetites and joy of eating . Great food and happy place to go in Markham.  They are not the best quality but the affordable good quality food and service. I would say  Lovely place for jap and Korean food lovers"}
{"text":"The best sushi place I've visited so far. All of the sushi is fresh, the menu has so many UNIQUE options, the place is lovely and the staff is always smiling and ready to help. Amazing."}
{"text":"Didn't find this place live up to their reviews, place is tucked in a little plaza and it's easy to miss. It was pretty packed upon arriving which was a good sign but it went down from there.   Ordered a lunch combo and the Toronto Roll which was The weirdest roll I've ever eaten lol. I ate it piece by piece because of the way it was presented which didn't really make any sense to me. Everything tasted frozen-fresh, not quite frozen but not quite fresh either... the portions were huge though.... they also ran out of toro or o-toro that day which was disappointing and the uni had the most pungent fishy aroma to it, it was bearyyyy edible.   Service was meh... didn't really seem to care about anything only filled cups when told and never checked up on us unless called.   Even though the reviews are pretty good at this place, I wouldn't give it another chance when I know places like Kokyo are light years ahead in quality."}
{"text":"It is one of the better quality sushi restaurants in Markham. I came here a few times and it usually was quite busy so come early or make reservations.   Sashimi are fresh, quality has been consistently great and the rolls are big. Although the rolls are big, they are on the OK/good-but-not-excellent side. When you dine-in, your meal comes with miso soup and salad. Not sure how their other stuff on the menu is, but their sushi do not disappoint!  Prices are reasonable and service is great and quick. The restaurant is on the smaller side, but has great atmosphere. Will continue returning!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I love this place!! This is my first time here and I will definitely come back! The service is fantastic, the food is great!! I love sushi and my standards are pretty high, but this is now one of my top 5 places of sushi I love to dine at. We went as a party of 4 and we got the 90 pieces sushi boat. It was recommended for 4-5 people. We had 2 girls and 2 guys. But I wat a lot o So, we decided on the 9 pieces. There was an option for 70 pieces for 3-4 people. Wow! I am so glad we didn't get that option!! I would had been starving.... !!   Love this place!"}
{"text":"one of my favourite sushi spots. only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because last time i was there the waiter dropped the lemon wedges off of a plate and later on when i got up to leave i accidentally stepped on one thinking he had picked them up. the rolls are large and delicious!"}
{"text":"I then knew why people recommended the Toronto Roll.  The Toronto Roll contained shrimp tempura and yam tempura on the inside and then assorted sashimi, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and wasabi mayo on the top.  Holy moly.  I had never seen a roll with so many chunks of assorted sashimi piled up on it before.  It was a crazy sushi and sashimi mountain!  (It worked out for me because I actually didn't want to order a full roll of carbs and order sashimi instead, but since I couldn't resist trying the much-recommended Toronto Roll, it was perfect since it had so much sashimi on top of it too.  Awesome!)"}
{"text":"I've come to this place a few times for both lunch and dinner. The lunch deals are good, as it comes with both a noodle dish (udon) and some sushi. I think it's good bang for buck. For dinner, we usually order lots of special rolls to share. They are pretty big in size, and the quality is not bad. Since the set up of the restaurant contains lots of rooms at the side, it's a little hard for people in the rooms to get service even with the bell provided. Our server brought us the wrong order once, and almost expected us to pay for it cause we touched it.She probably saw that there's no way in hell that was going to happen, so she let it go. Still, the service can definitely be improved."}
{"text":"I've came here about 5 times already. This place has amazing service. The waitresses are always happy and checking up on you to see if you need anything. I personally like the ambiance of the place.  I've tried their bento boxes and their udon. The portions are big and it really fills you up. The quality of the food is good but its not amazing. At the end of your meal they give you an orange that is already cut in a nice design for you."}
{"text":"Been here many times already but never wrote a review, but now I will!  Food:  - What I like about this place is their sashimi, especially their red tuna - thick, big slices and fresh!!!  - Their rolls are pretty good and big - Tip: Don't get their chirashi at dinner unless you want like all salmon pieces...  Service: - Friendly staff  - Medium/fast service   Atmosphere/Seating:  - Clean and nice decor - Private booth and tables (good for dates ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Been here 4-6 times and the quality of the food just doesn't change. Sushi is always fresh and noodles always come smokin' hot. Their spicy salmon roll is.. Awesome. Make sure you get that!  Service was.. FABOULOUS!"}
{"text":"Had a enjoyable lunch with my wife and 5yr old son. Was very quiet which really added to the experience.  Didn't feel rushed and service was attentive, very friendly and on point all around. Spicy Roll combo and Udon combo lunch special is what we all had. Portions were a good size, flavors & freshness def there as well.   Only critic would be the construction and plate presentation. A couple of rolls did come apart while tryn to eat and the rice may have been a tad on the stickier side because separating each roll was difficult at times.  Overall, def a great option for sushi in the area. Will be back for sure A+"}
{"text":"Osaka has the besssssst specialty sushi. I can't compare them to anybody else. Their fish is so fresh. Their rolls are quite big (which I LOVE), but I know some people who do not like large sushi rolls.  I have also tried their ramen..it was okay. I had the bbq pork ramen. The pork was not very flavourful and it was quite small.  My boyfriend loves their donburi bulgogi. It is very flavourful.  I have had their udon as well, which is great when its a cold day!  As for their service, they are usually very busy, but at the booths they have these buttons which you can press, they come check on you as pretty soon after pressing the button."}
{"text":"The setting is nice, as there are many rooms. So each party can have some privacy. In terms of sashimi, it's not bad but nothing to write home about. The sushi rolls were huge, very filling. If you are into rolls, this might be a place to check out.   Personally, I prefer sashimi. Not a bad experience. Friendly service."}
{"text":"My coworker from Vancouver who just moved to Toronto told me that the best sushi in the world is in Osaka....considering that I don't have the money to travel to Japan, I figure I'd just go to a place named Osaka in Markham. :-)  This place doesn't look like much on the outside, and is located in a plaza where the main stores are No Frills and Shoppers and across from a plaza that has a Dollarama.  So yeah, weird area.    However, upon walking inside, you notice how beautiful and cute the decor is.  It's like you walked into a different country.  The booths are in the corners and have some cute decor in them, there are tables for two in the middle and despite being a fairly small restaurant, they still have room for at least 80 people.  What I liked was that sound didn't travel very much here, so you could hold a conversation.  So  for decor/ambiance - definite 5/5  Food: For party of 2 girls and 1 guys, we ordered: a) Sunset roll (or sunny roll) - which had cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, crab meat, and shrimp tempura  b) King Spider rolls - basically a really big spider roll (soft shell crab) with a bit of spicy mayo  c) Fried oyster  d) Kalbi  e) Eel donburi  Overall, the food was very good, but my two favourite things that we ordered was the Kalbi and the Sunset roll.  What I liked most about the kalbi was the tenderness of the meat and the fact that there was a lot of it and very fresh.  Great taste. In addition, it came with some enoki mushrooms, which I love.In addition,  I rarely eat white rice at home and only eat it when I go out, but I loved the fact that they served purple rice with the eel donburi and the kalbi.    Items that were okay, but not mind blowing: King Spider roll and Eel donburi.    Verdict: If you are in the area, give it a shot - one of the better non AYCE sushi places in Markham and much better than Gal's."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Japanese restaurant that has good food and great atmosphere. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and really wished that we made reservations ahead of time. We waited for about 15 minutes but the entrance is narrow with only a couple chairs so it was quite uncomfortable for a group of six.  I ordered the Pork Cutlet Donburi ($10.95) that came with a miso soup. It was quite disappointing because the seasoning of the dish was bland and the meat was really thin and dry. The one upside of the dish is that it was a large serving, enough to be a meal on its own.   The sushi rolls were generously made with a lot of filling and toppings. They came with a miso soup and salad. For the most part, the rolls were good but pretty expensive. We had the Orange Dragon Roll ($14.95), Black Dragon Roll ($15.95), and the Toronto Roll ($16.95). I enjoyed the Dragon Rolls but they weren't outstanding. On the other hand, I was very impressed by the Toronto Roll. It's basically a shrimp tempura and yam tempura roll topped with assorted sashimi, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, unagi cause, spicy mayo, and wasabi mayo. The presentation was beautiful and made eating messy but it was delicious. It really lived up to the praise it receives on Yelp.   I give this place a 3/5 because aside from the Toronto Roll, everything was mediocre. I was also disappointed that they weren't serving uni that day but was advertising a Uni Roll promotion."}
{"text":"Quality and food portions are OK for Markham. The sushi is cut a bit thick to my liking since real Japanese sushi cuts should be cut thinly because no one wants to be chewing a large piece of raw fish in their mouth for too long. Ewe!!    The selection isn't bad but prices are a bit on the higher end even though your getting average quality sushi. If you come here for dinner, try to make a reservation as space is limited and it gets pretty packed between the hours of 7-9pm especially on weekends. A waitress took forever to flag down especially if you are sitting in one of their booths which has the Japanese curtains. So be prepared to constantly have to flag someone down. Food and service a bit slow. Overall, my experience here was average.  Nothing special and nothing to leave a lasting impression. Would I come back here? Probably ... but just out of convenience ... I'd splurge a bit more to also go someplace that serves the higher quality sushi with a better service since dining in a restaurant is all about the customer experience. My experience where was more mediocre. If I were to choose a word to describe my experience then it would be just \"Meeeeh!\""}
{"text":"Dinner for a family of four on a Saturday night at 7:00pm - waited about 20 mins to be seated.  Great service and fresh sushi - Spent approximately $109 1)sushi combo for $42 (as in photo) - it's fresh and a good deal for all to share 2) Amazing Spider roll $17.95 ( as in photo ) It's a bit pricey but good  3) seafood stir fry udon ($14.95 ) kids loved it w tons of sauce 4) shrimp tempura $8.95 5 pc - good deal 5) 10 of sashimi $11  Service was amazing quick even though the restaurant was packed ! Amazing and would return again"}
{"text":"Cozy Japanese/Korean resturant with excellent decor. They have individual rooms for groups and two seaters in the centre of the resturant that are partitioned for privacy. However service wasn't their. Empty napkin holder, forgotten miso soup and long wait time for food (once it started coming, it all came at once). When flagging down a server to inquire about the miso, she said \"not your server\". Rude in my opinion, as we had no idea such a small resturant had a pre-assigned server for each table. Tried the Toronto roll ($15.95), soft shell crab roll ($15.95), spicy salmon roll ($5.95) and kalbi/galbi (beef short rib) bento. Overall all the dishes were tasty, but I could do without the Toronto roll. Would defiantly recommend the kalbi bento ($19). About ~$65 before tip for everything. Wish I could give this place a higher score, but the service aspect of my visit limits it."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen has a rich soup base, whose flavour is readily absorbed by the spruce and soft ramen noodle.  But the best is still to come with the Toronto roll which may not be the attractive dish, but it's like a surashi don mixed with tempura! Never had anything like it... must try!"}
{"text":"We ordered the dynamite roll and shrimp Tempura Udon.  My cousin and niece ordered a few other items (see pictures).  The items are are but more pricey than average but their prime are larger as well.  Dynamite roll was good and portion size is enough for me.  They really give you enough shrimp Tempura and enough veggies vs rice which is what we like.  Service is friendly... Overall, I wouldn't drive here just for their food but if I was in the area, I would come again."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Markham. Great sushis, smiley staff, and great deco! Went there probably 6/7 times and have never been disappointed.  The other place which can compete with it is Tomo sushi in RH...but rolls are not as good as the ones you'll find at Osaka! :-) To conclude...a \"must go\"!"}
{"text":"We were there for a light dinner tonight. First we orderd Dragon roll.  The roll contained mostly veggies and the eel on top of the  roll was very thin.Then we ordered salmon sashimi and it was also very thin.  The unagi roll we ordered was very small."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends after a hike nearby. We called ahead to book a reservation and luckily we did. It was packed after. This restaurant is tucked away in a plaza not too visible to the eye. Once inside, the lighting was dim but clean. Servers sat us down quickly to our reserved tables.  Once we decided to order our food. The server then came back with the standard fare: miso soup and salad. Not long after, our food arrived. The plating was clean and they do try to make it fancy looking? However it was the taste I came here for. I ordered the sushi combo with California roll. The fish tasted fresh and didn't have the frozen taste. The rice was just still warm and still maintain that vinegar taste, which was good. So I was quite satisfied.  Overall experience is pretty good. Will come back for other fares they have on menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I first started coming here when it opened. the owner always remembered my name and my order. Now I'm here again for the first time in months and my order was remembered! I couldn't believe it. The food is absolutely delicious. Clean tasting, unique and consistent. Tables and washrooms spotless. It has private cubicles or open booths. the music is lovely leaning to smooth jazz. So rare. More than ample parking and only takes seconds to walk. Never empty, there are always customers. Food fairly priced. I can't say enough great things about my positive experiences here every time. I highly recommend Osaka!"}
{"text":"4.5!!  So glad I came across this place. It's a quaint little spot serving Japanese and Korean food in a plaza with barely any other Asian restaurants in it (which is unusual for Markham) so it can be easy to miss. We came by for lunch looking to grab a quick meal but hadn't expected to enjoy Osaka as much as we did.  Our meal started off with a miso soup each and a salad (my boyfriend didn't get one because it came as part of his bento box). Miso soup is light in flavor and not too salty. Salad was a good portion and the dressing was on point. As for our mains:  Kalbi Bento Box ($11.95) - For the price, it came with a ton of juicy, perfectly seasoned kalbi so we were satisfied with that. The amount of meat given alone makes it worth it. However, my boyfriend was disappointed that it came with a yam tempura roll since he isn't a big fan but I added ingredients from my Toronto roll to spice things up and all was well again!  Toronto Roll ($15.95) - Yes, this is the one everyone raves about and with good reason. It's a mess to eat but so fun at the same time. The roll is filled with yam and shrimp tempura topped with avocado, cucumber, crab meat, tobiko, salmon & tuna sashimi drizzled with their special sauce. SOO good and fresh. It had everything I usually like in/on my maki rolls and they were so generous with the ingredients that every bite was full of flavor. I don't think I'd ever be able to pass up on ordering this roll. 5/5  As for service, I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I was expecting it to be terrible but I hadn't expected it to be so good. Everyone was really friendly and polite, consistently wearing a smile on their faces. Food came out promptly and there were no communication issues as they all spoke pretty good English.  Without a doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. They did a great job with the new decor.   Don't order the spicy maki set. I felt so sick because of all the sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside and the inside looks like any other Japanese restaurant. However, the food was good and the price was reasonable. Service was friendly and efficient.   I would have recommended this restaurant, however ... we returned a few months later and the food was not very good. It wasn't properly seasoned and it was just blah. We left disappointed. I may try it again in the future."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 stars.  Staff was friendly. Service was good. Food came out at a good time.   Rolls were bigger than average. Wide selection and very detailed menu providing you information on what's inside and outside of the roll (which I like).  Ordered veggie tempura appetizer and two rolls to share between two people. Decently filling as the rolls were big but came to $26 each so a little pricier.  Veggie tempura - batter was fresh and light. Crispy outside with flavourful vegetables inside. Zucchini wasn't oily. Yam and kabocha were fried well that the veggie spoke for itself. Also came with mushroom, asparagus, onion ring, and broccoli.  Dancing eel roll - this one was a bit bland for my liking but it might have been because the made it wrong. The roll should've been unagi and salmon inside, but they gave us a California roll with unagi instead. That being said, the roll could've had more eel inside and a bit more sauce, but the roll itself was good with fresh ingredients. For their mistake they did give us 3 slices of salmon sashimi to make up for it free of charge.  Osaka spicy scallop roll - don't really remember what this roll was called but it had spicy scallop on top and inside is a California roll with shrimp tempura. Again although the roll was well rolled and flavourful with the big chunk of avocado, the sauce on top was lacking and it was more bland that I would've enjoyed. Nonetheless the scallop was sweet but didn't really add much flavour to the roll overall.  I find that wish sushi places it can be a hit or miss with the rolls, but the tempura was so well fried and seasoned that I believe the flavours of the rolls can be better depending on the actual roll. Nonetheless, rice was perfectly cooked and didn't overpower the rest of the roll, but maybe a tad bit much of cucumber and avocado, would benefit if more of the other ingredients (shrimp tempura or salmon etc) especially when paying that price."}
{"text":"big portion? nice booth? fair price. But the sushi rice is not that I like. There is no flavour. Sushi rice should be a little sweet. It will taste better."}
{"text":"Didn't expect to find a really delicious rolls in such a tiny place at Markham plaza. I've becoming a regular customers here ever since i tried out their sushi rolls, esp the Toronto Rolls which has sashimi on top as well. Really delicious and huge in size! Recommended few of fam and friends to come here, and they all like it! Their service is also excellent, the owner and manager are very nice and helpful! A good place for sushi around the neighbourhood. Please make reservation as they're space are small and limited, they normally have a big line up."}
{"text":"It's a bit far out from the usual places I head to but I thought I'd give this place a try. The food is good, not anything negative to say about it. I wanted to celebrate my brother's birthday and was looking for a nice and intimate setting.  What I really liked about the place is the semi-private booths & rooms they have for almost every table. We got to be in one of the private rooms for a small group of 4 people.  The decor is also great and tasteful. The service friendly as well.  Plus side is they have the call button for service so you never have to flag down a waitstaff. Only downside is they didn't let us close the doors completely. Now for the sushis, I suggested we order the boat since we were all there for sushi, sashimi and nigiri. We got veggie tempura, tako yaki, and the boat of 73 pieces. Sushis weren't out of this world but the sashimis were fresh. Tea was complimentary and the neat thing is they give it in sealed thermos to keep it hot. The waiter was very friendly and offered good advice.  Since I brought a cake, he provided us extra plates for it and cleared everything out of the way. Overall, I would say that a good part of going there is for the ambiance and secondly for the food but it's a nice escape for an intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has excellent sushi. Trust me, I'm a connoisseur.  It does get busy-busy so be sure to call and book a spot ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Saturday 630 pm was full.  The waitress indicated a room was available but must vacate by 730 as there was a reservation.  The food took some time to arrive and we had to hurry as we had 20 minutes left.  A+ for effort to accommodate us when it was busy and their pleasant service.  If the food arrived sooner, it would have been a better experience (understandable since it seemed busy).  Had the salmon lover roll and the black dragon roll.  Both were quite delicious although not spectacular.   Portions were quite generous as 2 people were full on 2 rolls.  Price was       $13.95 and $15.95 respectively for the above rolls.  At 730 pm, there was a long lineup of people waiting, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Osaka as it has pretty good reviews on Yelp and there's only so many good sushi restaurants in Markham. Sadly, it was a disappointment.   It is pricey here for mediocre grade sushi. I've paid less for much better sashimi and rolls. I wasn't \"wowed\" but more so just eating because sushi is my favourite.  Unfortunately, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I nicknamed this place GOATsaka for a reason.  I've been here twice.  The first time I came with a group of friends and they accommodated us well.  I ordered the sushi/sashimi bento box...and I was underwhelmed, as it was quite mediocre.  I was jealous of my friends who ordered the special rolls - they were much bigger and seemed like a better deal.  I decided to come here again with a friend recently and refused to make the same mistake.  I ordered the Osaka Special Roll and the Toronto Roll (both come w/ soup and salad) which were $16.95 each.  They were both huge and quite good, though I preferred the Toronto Roll.    We were both stuffed and could barely finish the rolls.  Personally, I prefer nigiri sushi and sashimi, and so I probably won't be back to Osaka for a while.  Visit Osaka if you like rolls, but don't come if you just want normal sushi."}
{"text":"Oh Osaka.  This place is truly a hidden gem.  Everything from the decor to the service to the sushi is authentic.  You can order pretty much anything off the menu and never be disappointed although I recommend the special rolls.  Go with a few of your raw fish loving friends and split a few different ones!   Top favourites are probably Salmon Lovers, French Kiss, Geisha, and DJ Dragon.  The rolls are so beautifully crafted by humble sushi chefs.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're a fan of ramen try their Miso Ramen.  Great price for a large portion. The service is fast and warm for the most part although the servers have their days. This is a really great alternative to The typical AYCE experience if you don't feel like getting unnecessarily full.  5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Cute Japanese restaurant tucked in the NoFrills plaza on Highway 7 and west of Markham Road. We came pretty early and we had seats right away, the waiters were really nice and fast paced to the point where I felt a little rushed when I came here to eat. I suppose it was because it was a Sunday night, so there were quite a few guests that came here, but not completely packed yet.  Inside Osaka, there are mini Japanese styled rooms for people to enjoy their dinner as a family! I love these Japanese styled rooms in the restaurants.  We ordered the Chirashi Sushi ($18.95), Salmon Lover ($12.95) and the Black Dragon (15.95). The order came at a decent speed, not super fast, but not super slow. They also served one miso soup with our order (I think it was the chirashi), and 2 complimentary salads.   The chirashi sushi is comprised of a huge portion of rice with terriyaki sauce spread over half a plate, 3 pieces of salmon, 6 white tunas (3 white ones and 3 clearish ones), 3 red tunas, 1 piece of crab meat, 1 piece of shrimp, 1 piece of octopus and 1 piece of red and 1 piece of white surf clam. The sashimi was really fresh, but I thought there was way too much rice. I also would have preferred it if the rice was served in a bowl.  The salmon lover was literally what it sounded like. It had a piece of salmon on top of a salmon filled maki roll. This was a HUGE roll, there was a TON of salmon inside the maki roll, I swear they put like 10 pieces of salmon inside this. There were eight pieces of maki sushi, so definitely worth $12.95.   The black dragon roll, I liked a lot as well! It was an unagi slice laid on top with terriyaki sauce and a lot of filling including avocado, cucumbers, crab meat, etc. This was a very large roll as well, I think for price the salmon might be more worth it, but at the same time, unagi is quite expensive.   There was a sliced orange cut in the cutest way served for dessert! Come give Osaka a try!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd update and it's only because I've been craving Osaka sushi for the last 3 weeks because I've been on a long trip away from home. Now that I got to have Osaka I've noticed so much has changed. After their renovation (sushi bar was relocated) they have definitely changed some of their kitchen staff or some of their ingredients. Their sushi is still top notch and I'd give 5 stars just for that but I ordered their spicy miso ramen (which has always been delicious to me) with double the noodles and the quality of the noodles tasted like instant noodles. They weren't thick and wavy like the past years I've had it, and the broth to say the least was bland. It was actually spicy which was nice but very disappointing. Wouldn't have ordered double noodles if I had known the noodles were completely different. Maybe they have been boiled too long? I'll stick to the fish dishes and donburi when I come here from now on. Still have a soft spot in my heart, Osaka!"}
{"text":"They recently renovated and it's pretty neatly setup inside. The booths give nice privacy during meals.   Food was ok, expected better quality. The roll that we ordered was not rolled tightly enough and was kind of Falling apart as we were eating it. The seaweed on the roll was a bit too chewy.   Bento box was not bad but for the price of the bento, could've gone to have AYCE. Ramen ordered was typical, nothing special. They ran out of toro so we couldn't try.   Overall, food was average and service was good."}
{"text":"went there yesterday and got the rainbow sushi for $13.95 it was very yummy and BIG. can't even fit the whole sushi in my mouth. my friend got the French kiss and she thought it was yummy too. it includes miso soup and salad which was also yummy . I would definitely come again because they also give candy with their receipt"}
{"text":"I had ramen. Portions were filling (and I eat a lot), and the interior and utensils were clean! Service was fast and it's a good place to talk with friends. I think I had seafood ramen. I'd recommend here for lunch or chilling with friends."}
{"text":"Pretty good Japanese food served by Korean chefs! Service is friendly and the sushi/sashimi is fresh most of the time!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and Osaka has been in my good books until the past few months where I thought the quality has dropped but I'm happy to say that Osaka is back to where it was when I first came here. You have to come here!  I've tried almost everything on the menu and while everything is pretty good, the standout are clearly the special rolls here. I'm a huge fan of the salmon lover's (spicy salmon), king spider (soft-shell crab), Toronto - shrimp and yam tempura with a bunch of sashimi and veggies on the top. It's an absolutely amazing mess that's a joy to eat. I am also a big fan of the kamikaze (tuna, with crispy bits and spicy sauce). Lastly, their hae dup bap is probably the best one I have had anywhere.  We came here on a Sunday evening with a party of 13 and ordered tons of food - 11 special rolls, udon, bunch of shrimp tempura. The spicy seafood udon was great - chewy noodles with a hefty amount of veggies and seafood! And the tempura was hot, fresh, and crispy - so good!   The rolls were delicious, they're rather large but I enjoy them like that! Rather than going into each roll, I will let the pictures and the food speak for themselves.   I like decor and interior here too, those private booths are awesome. Service can be a hit and miss sometimes. We had decent service."}
{"text":"Loved this experience! My mom and I went for sushi on a Friday night and this cozy restaurant was packed! Although the wait time (20 minutes) was  pleasantly shorter considering the volume of customers, I would recommend reserving a spot in advance. Staff was kind and patient, and the decor was adorable!  We started with 6 unagi rolls (around $5) and for our mains, we ordered the Salmon Lover special roll (10 for $13.99 I believe) and a chicken donburi (around $10.99). Although we enjoyed all the dishes, next time, we'll definitely be focusing on the special rolls. The Salmon Lover's, although seemingly expensive, was worth every penny! The rolls were as tall as my index finger and stuffed w salmon and tempura bits! Will definitely return soon to try other rolls -- 10/10 recommend for a cozy sushi experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars I came for lunch with my sister and enjoyed a couple of udon combos.  Very good value for udon + a sushi roll. Sushi was not crazy packed with rice, which was nice =) ba-dum tsh~   Service was wonderful, the server checked on us several times and made sure we always had tea.   However, the place is definitely in need of a facelift, and maybe a larger variety of lunch specials."}
{"text":"During the weekends around dinner time it can be busy and a wait for a table could be 15 minutes. They take reservations even for 2 people. The service is pretty nice but haha sometimes I wonder how much dust collects on their built in wall structures and hanging umbrella decor...  I usually get the takoyaki ($7 for 6 pieces, its a good price!)- it comes out steaming hot and covered in lots of bonito flakes! The lunch special of udon and spicy salmon roll is also only $13 and comes with a small side salad and miso soup. I'd pass on the ramen though its nothing amazing.  The special rolls are really packed and they are no stingy on the ingredients. My favourite sushis are: - The Toronto roll ($16) is sweet potato roll covered in a variety of sashimi and 3 sauces (a spicy mayo, teriyaki kind of sweet sauce and a mustardy one) - Geisha Roll ($12) Spicy salmon and tempura bits inside and topped with mango - Salmon Lovers ($13) Spicy salmon and tempura bits inside and topped with more salmon  Complementary fruit (usually oranges or watermelon) is also served at the end of the dinner meals. Probably the best sushi in the Markham area and much much better quality than all you can eat places."}
{"text":"The fish were all fresh and the service was fast. The chicken was cooked just right. Not overcooked. Seating area has plenty of privacy and the staff's were curious.  Will return. Check out their bento boxes, they are the best bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month, and I always return for their rolls. Their \"Toronto Roll\" (around $17) is a must try! It comes in a portion big enough for 2 people. Having tried a lot of Japanese restaurants, I haven't seen anything like this roll around town.   If you don't feel like a single roll, their bento boxes are also a really big portion for about $20~$25 depending on which bento you get. It came with 2 spring rolls, 12 pcs of sushi rolls, 8 pcs of tempura.   Between the 2, we spend about $40 avg for each of our visits.  Service was great, and fast."}
{"text":"Lunch date on a Saturday at 12:30pm.  We walked in at 12:30pm on a Saturday. Every table but 2 were taken by parties of 4 or more. We waited at least 10 min before being seated in a private room. Loved that, but that love soon turned to regret! It took just over 20 min for anyone to come in to ask us for our drink order, to bring us some green tea and to take our food order. 30-35 min since we arrived at that point. Their menu is HUGE! There are so many sushi, sashimi & terriyaki options. Large variety of special rolls - which i love! I placed the order for myself and my \"guest\" because we were going to share everything in addition to ordering a couple of items (sushi & salad) each for ourselves. The server took down the order & replied \"that's a lot of food for you\". Hmmm, REALLY?!? Even if i did order all of that for myself (which i didn't) - unacceptable comment.   Here are the items we ordered:  Deep fried tofu: generous portion of crispy tofu with terriyaki glaze drizzled on it Gold 888 Roll - see pics Double Dynamite Crunch Roll - see pics Sashimi salad 4 pieces of a la carte sushi - maguro (tuna) - melt in your mouth goodness! Best i've had at any sushi restaurant in Markham!  My only issue was the wait time when we arrived. Also, we were there for just over 2.5 hours in total from the time we arrived to when we finished eating. NOBODY came to our table to ask us how our food was or to offer us anything else to drink after we received our order. I wasn't impressed by that at all. I'm hoping to go back & try the terriyaki & bento boxes. Hopefully service wont be an issue again. One thing we did notice was that there was a bell on the wall to push for service - they didn't point it out to us when we arrived and were seated. By the time we noticed it, they never came anyways.  Overall the quality of food was great. Flavours were certainly there for the different types of rolls and the sauces used to accentuate the flavour of the fish in each roll. Presentation of the sushi & rolls was beautiful and nicely done. Nothing fell apart. They could do without using curly parsley as garnish - doesn't go with sushi. The ratio of fish vs vegetables was perfection! Money well spent for the meal! They just need to work on service there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Went here for lunch on Sunday waited 10min for a seat.  Not too bad got the sushi lunch pretty fresh and the Toronto specialty roll not part of lunch special but does come with miso was quite nice.  Little pricy but all good will try again"}
{"text":"This place is always solid and the customer service always very nice. It's not the BEST Japanese/Korean food out there, but it's consistently good. What is lacks in finesse it makes up for in portion size. The portions are huge. It's our go-to sushi place these days."}
{"text":"I've been to Osaka in Markham a number of times and each time has been a pleasurable experience.  The serving staff is amazingly friendly and the food is just divine.  There is plenty of parking since it is located within a plaza.  A word of advice...If dining there with a party of six or more people, do call in advance to book a table."}
{"text":"Really good! Nice server, tasty, fair price. I've been there may times and plan on going back many more."}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi restaurant. Food is always fresh, tasty and well presented. Service is exceptional and staff is very friendly and welcoming. You must come here for a great eating experience."}
{"text":"I live close by so I used to come here a lot, my favourite is the Toronto Roll, however they make that differently everytime, sometimes you get more, some times less. Most of the other rolls are okay. The prices has gone up way too much. The service is hit and miss. When someones food comes 30 minutes after we ordered, a little apology would be the right thing to do. The uni is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good quality of fish and like the fish/rice ratio in the Sushi, nice to have a room by ourselves."}
{"text":"This place is literally so good. Every single time I go I'm amazed. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm leaving out one star because they desperately need a bigger facility. It was fine when they first opened and the crowds were smaller. Now, you will be standing and waiting for at least an hour if you don't have reservations (often even if you do have them). Understaffed for the amount of customers who come in, and teeny tiny restaurant without enough space for those waiting (which are ALOT). That all said....the sushi is by far the best in the GTA and always fresh. Just super irritated with the size of this place for how popular they are."}
{"text":"I really like this place,  it's my new go to sushi restaurant in Markham!    The few times I have been here so far, I have been very satisfied with the freshness of the fish they use in their sushi, no matter what time of day it is.  I'm a classics type of guy so I've only had their nigiri and sashimi.    They use high quality fish which are filet beautifully on your plate for you to enjoy.  They do love to use cucumbers here in their maki rolls, like their Lobster roll and Kamikaze rolls.  The rolls are crafted just right with each grain of rice packed elegantly into each portion, which is obvious of a sushi's chef years of experience.  Service is pretty prompt as they are a smaller restaurant, your tea is refilled without you asking for it.   They also serve the crunchy soup noodle during dinner, and regular miso soup during lunch.    Their price is a little higher, but you get what you pay for and that is high quality sushi in a cozy Japanese restaurant.   If you order take out party tray that's over $30, you receive two cans of pop without additional charge.   For a decent, great quality sushi in Markham where it has been very saturated, look no more than Osaka Sushi in Markham!"}
{"text":"A lovely classical appearance. Very good service.   Food was really good though I found the sushi and sashimi did not taste as fresh and without the sauces of the rolls, was not as good as them. Tempura was amazing though, the batter was incredibly light and crispy with a delicious and not overly salty dipping sauce.   The dolsot bimbimbap was a bit more expensive than most Korean places but had a few more ingredients and looked a bit larger.   The Toronto roll was AMAZING! I would definitely recommend it for all to try.   Overall, it was delicious and I'd return again."}
{"text":"Really good food. Had spicy pork ramen, gyoza, and teriyaki beef. Super large portion of ramen. All very tasty. Service was great and they accepted my dollars when they apparently never do. I stopped asking because every place I've visited accepts the dollar. Will be back before trip is over."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come here again!  Service is super friendly, and the value is very high (price/quality).  I especially enjoyed how most tables are in a private room, similar to that of Korean bars. Well, this restaurant is Korean-owned.  For the price you pay, you get so much food and of great quality and presentation. I will post pictures to this review as soon as I can.  There are many free parking spaces in the plaza lot.  Try to come early because there was quite a long lineup."}
{"text":"Go to sushi place in Markham. My favorites are spicy chicken donburi and spicy salmon roll. Great service !"}
{"text":"One of the higher quality sushi places in the GTA however they were understaffed on a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"Great Japanese and Korean food - sushi is great (and generous portions) as are all noodle dishes. We had no complaints -- service was a little slow but they were busy and still brought some food over quickly when one of our party started to crash. As soon as dinner was done, our kids asked when we could come back next."}
{"text":"Really crazy rolls (like the Toronto roll) with sashimi pieces piled on top of a giant roll. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Osaka is my go to a-la-cart Japanese restaurant in Markham. They are always busy so wait times are usually expected. Their staff is very friendly and polite. Although the appetizers are delicious, the price point is pretty high for the amount of food they give. Their special maki rolls are decently priced and worth. All the rolls are amazing and the portion is enough for sharing. You can easily be full without even eating half of it. My favorites are the Salmon Lovers (spicy salmon topped with spicy salmon and tempura bits) and the Amazing Spider Roll which comes with an entire soft shell crab. The dinner bentos are pricier than most places. My favorite among the bento boxes would be the Kalbi- easily comes off the bones and very flavorful. They do however have lunch specials with the bentos. I would recommend trying bentos during lunch and  having rolls for dinner. The Don's come with a lot of vegetables and not a lot of what their feature was for so I would recommend getting rolls instead. The ramen/udon was okay but I would not come here for it."}
{"text":"Been to Osaka a few times to dine in and order take out as well. Their restaurant is quite cute with the private rooms all along the walls with Japanese Curtains. Above the rooms the tops were decorated like they were little Japanese temples. Near the ceilings they even have a roll of Japanese Umbrellas as decor.   Their sashimi and sushi rolls are quite fresh.  I usually order a Medium Sashimi, Sushi, & Roll Combo for Father's Day every year. This year was a bit disappointing, cause their wakame salad we ordered for take out was still icy frozen with ice still in it. Also we found bone in one of the sashimi pieces. The rolls were also rolled very loose, when you pick it up with the chopsticks they kind of fall apart.  We also ordered the Shrimp Tempura..but I didn't really like their batter. It was more like a pasty batter.  Maybe it was due to them being behind because of Father's Day. We had to wait an extra 1/2 hr for our take out to be ready. But they did offer us tea for waiting and asked if we were ok.   Regardless I still like coming here every so often to eat. :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the good quality sushi restaurants in Markham. Service is super friendly, portions are good and the sashimi is delicious.   I've been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. I've mostly ordered sushi and sashimi sets here, not having tried their Korean food. The food tastes great! The fish have always been a very decent size and tastes fresh! The texture is great and the rice is well seasoned.   The server's and hostesses here are extremely friendly and very helpful too! The restaurant itself is well furnished, clean, and despite seeming a bit small, actually offers quite a bit of privacy for each table!   Great place to go for a date or quiet meal with friends :)"}
{"text":"Average food. Slow Service. Great decor."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go-to sushi joints in the Markham area. The ambiance of the restaurant is great! The decor, including the little private rooms with sliding doors, is super cute - especially when its a girls night out! Pricing wise, Osaka is quite moderate. For the high quality of sushi you are getting, the price is definitely something I will pay. Overall, would recommend to give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The rolls were above average, tasty and good sized portions. Better than some all you can eat places. The raw stuff like the Shashimi are not that fresh & have fishy smell. I would just stick to ordering their cooked rolls like Spider Roll and Dynamite rolls. The grilled squid was ok too. Would come back here again for the cooked stuff bc close to our home Cost around $20/person including tips & taxes fot 3 of us total. We had 3 rolls, grilled squid, 2 ice cream. Waitress was nice & friendly. Gave good recommendations"}
{"text":"Osaka sushi is hella expensive for what they are selling. Mediocre food that makes go \"meh it's food...it probably won't make me shit bricks\" the service however saves the place as they were very polite and apologetic.  The chirashi dinner was pathetic. There was a strong fishy taste that clearly indicates it ain't fresh. The cut was also poor as I had cubes of fish rather than slices...The rice itself was poorly seasoned so yeah. I just shat out a meal that was probably fresher than when I ate it.  The rolls however were quite good. Honestly come here for the rolls. I only had one but it was miles better than the chirashi. They are quite large and the menu contains a large selection. If I was to come back it would only be for the rolls as I only had the salmon lovers."}
{"text":"Update and a downgrade from 4 stars to 3. Umm what happened to this place?!? It used to be my go to spot. We ordered the Spicy Orange Dragon Roll and it was so disappointing. It didn't taste good. They usually put all this stuff on top of the rolls, but for some reason it was too the side. Every single roll I picked up fell apart almost immediately. Seriously, so disappointed! Just when you finally think you found a good local spot. The only upside is the service is much faster than it used to be but could be because we were fairly late for dinner (9 pm on Friday night). The paragraph below is my original review. You'll note the difference and how disappointed I am now in comparison!!!  My new go to sushi spot! It used to not be as busy about a year ago but there's a lineup out the door every time I go now. I spoke to the main waitress and she told me the ownership changed recently and it's been better ever since - better advertising maybe? I've noticed that the service is a lot faster than it used to be. The portions are HUGE so order wisely. Recommend the Spicy Orange Dragon Roll and great deal on salmon sashimi :)"}
{"text":"Osaka is fantastic. As you would imagine a higher end sushi joint to be.   Ordered a salmon avocado roll; 6 pieces of sashimi and a red dragon roll - $40.   While on the pricier end of the spectrum, the quality was absolutely amazing. The sashimi was fresh and large. Soy sauce and wasabi was provided.   Red dragon roll was absolutely massive and filling. It was layered with crab, shrimp and salmon.   The salmon avocado rolls were fantastic and delicious.   Although this was a take out order, I will be back for the dine in experience. The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Every time i come here I feel I've left Markham and teleported somewhere else. Very very good sushi."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at Osaka.  I always drive by it but felt like it was time to give this place a try.  We ordered the bento box, udon noodles and side plate of sushi.  All the food tasted amazing and the customer service was very friendly.   The restaurant was also very spacious.  From the outside, it looks like a very tiny shop but this place can accommodate a decent number of people.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Freshhhhh sushi! Make sure to make reservations for this place as it gets really busy on the weekends. I made a reservation and still had to wait but not too long ~10 mins. We got a booth and it was nice to have that privacy.   We ordered tempura donburi, Uni sushi, 10 salmon sashimi, Paradise in Osaka roll, and amazing spider roll. The tempura donburi was crispy, the vegetable and rice were very flavorful and not over cooked or drenched in some sort of sauce. This dish really impressed me and the portion size was good for 2. The amazing spider roll and Osaka rolls were out of this world!! But it kept falling apart! Grr... Their pickled ginger was really tasty and sweet! A good sushi restaurant always serves really good low acidic pickled ginger and is not too pink, this was a light yellow the real color of ginger. Then Uni sushi and salmon sashimi were very fresh, very buttery and yummy!! At the end of your meal you will be served with fresh cut orange wedges with your bill.   Service was good not great. It was hard to catch their attention if you needed something. I had to ask to get more water for my boyfriend and I 3x. But that's about it.  Overall great place for large and small groups, prices are reasonable and their specials are cheap!"}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE SUSHI PPACE IN MARKHAM!! Their rolls are bomb  Food is really fresh and really yummy. I would suggest booking ahead of time if you have more than 4 people because it gets pretty packed on the weekend."}
{"text":"I have been here several time by now and keep forgetting to check it. Their food never disappoint and the portion is enough to fill people, the way they cut their rolls and how they display their food(sushi,rolls, sashimi,etc) is very good. Love it!"}
{"text":"Osaka reminded me of how Japanese restaurants were like before the all-you-can-eat craze started.  The decor looked like a traditional Japanese restaurant, too; I literally felt like walking in a time tunnel.  Yes, during the good, old days, Japanese food was this good: sashimi (25 pieces for $25) was fresh with a good variety of fishes, some expensive, in one dinner entree; the special rolls ($13) had just a little rice, etc..  We also ordered a seafood udon ($11) that was a disappointment.  The udon was very soggy, and the portion was small compared to a regular one person dinner size.  I can make one of better quality without even trying.  The rolls and sashimi were 5 stars.  The udon was 2 stars.  The price was rather high, so the overall rating was 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my GO TO sushi restaurant. Their SPECIAL maki rolls are the show stopper at this restaurant. Especially their Toronto and Volcano rolls are DA BOMB!!  :9 People especially the ones waiting outside will always STARE at those rolls. Sorry, can't touch this! They are MINNEEE! =.=\"   The maki rolls are always beautifully presented! They have two pages of intense special roll selections and it usually takes at least 15 minutes to scroll through all the options. We (party of 2) usually order just TWO special maki rolls and we are pretty stuffed. The chefs really jam pack ingredients in their rolls and you wouldn't leave the restaurant feeling hungry. We usually have to play rock, paper, scissors and the loser will have to eat the remaining pieces! XP  If you are planning to go for their sushi/sashimi, I would hold off on that. I tried them a few times and sometimes their sushi/ sashimi aren't that fresh. They have a lot of lunch/dinner combo options (cooked food, sashimi, sushi, rolls, udon) and the prices are pretty fair. I tried their bulgogi and it was pretty decent and they give a generous portion.   They usually have top notch service. Even during busy rush hour, the servers are very friendly and would like to help you out. If you manage to get the booth, you will have a bell to ring for service. I really like this feature so you don't have to wave down the waiter/waitress.  Overall, I will definitely recommend this place to anybody who would like to try some special maki rolls!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi nabe udon $11.95 - there was so much stuff in this udon. Two types of mushrooms, onions, red pepers, diced carrots, veggie greens and the bulgogi itself with udon. The bowl was packed. The bulgogi beef had a sweet sauce which made the soup a bit sweet too. There was a good amount of meat as well which made me happy.   Miso ramen $9.95 - tasted good but would not recommend coming here just to try their ramen. Lots of pork but lots of fat on the pork too.  Gyoza $4.95 - comes with 6 dumplings. Nice and crispy on the outside.  Everything tasted good but the udon really impressed me the most.   Service has really changed from past experiences. Everyone is all smiles. Service was fast. We were even asked how we liked our meal. I'm not sure if its new owners but there is a vast improvement on service."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a surprise...this seemingly desolate, lonely, and possibly tacky restaurant was actually decent and returnable.  I wouldn't say it was awesome as I've been to too many yummy Japanese restaurants in tdot...but since it's around the corner from my house and my seven month old is sometimes limiting....we will be back.  We ordered the sashimi platter and a fees rolls.    I found their menu a bit westernized for my taste in terms of the rolls.  Cheese and mayo in rolls...a bit too gross for me but rainbow, and the dancing eel (i think that is what it's called) was not bad.  Service was good...even gave us freebees...like dumplings, tempura and some fried mash potato.    Will be back....seems harsh for a three star rating but IMO, 4 and 5 stars are really reserved for true excellence and this one is just A-OK!  :)"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews on Yelp. Was quite disappointed. The sashimi tray is very average and basic, the usual salmon, white tuna, red snapper, nothing special. I found it expensive seeing how it was mostly cheap fish, and it was not the freshest.  Service is pretty good. When we ordered, the lady said that it might be too much food which avoided us from having sushi packed - which is good since sushi is never good overnight. This warrants an extra star.  Overall, I wouldnt say it is a must try nor will I be aching to return. If I'm in the area and craving sushi, I could settle for Osaka. But, then again, there are plenty of other Japanese/Korean restaurants not far away."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Japanese restaurant.  Price is a bit more than other restaurants and all a la carte, but the quality is top notch.  All the rolls are amazing and presented so nicely.  Nothing bad to say and love the decor!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Wonderful service and pretty delicious sushi! I would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"The worse sushi place I have been to in the longest time. My boyfriend and I both agree this place is overpriced for it's quality of food served here.   There was about 15 minutes wait on a Friday evening as it was pretty packed. After getting seated, we got our menus and decided on trying the following:  * Small Sashimi Platter  * Ikayaki (BBQ squid with special sauce)  * Sushi Pizza  * Salmon and Spicy Scallop Roll * Salmon Tataki Roll  * Uni (This was one of their specials)   Salmon and Spicy Scallop Roll was disappointing, barely any Scallop; 95% salmon and 5% Scallop. The Roll also fell apart and taste was nothing memorable. Salmon Tataki Roll was just unappetizing and I ate only one piece.   Uni according to my boyfriend tasted disgusting. According to the server, the Uni was fresh but it was not fresh at all. Another disappointment.   Sashimi platter wasn't fresh, it tasted ok but not amazing. I have definitely been to other sushi places in the area that offer fresh sashimi. I noticed whilst packing the sashimi, there was an oyster hiding behind a lemon which looked gross.   Overall, service was OK but the food quality is questionable and below average. I would not recommend coming to this place for sushi, there are far better places to have sushi then this place. Don't waste your $ here. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews here or did I miss something here?"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here. I had the bulgogi nabe udon and Osaka roll. The udon had lots of vegetables and bulgogi, which is always good, but a little too sweet for my liking. The Osaka roll was also good, but not enough to justify the price. I like the decor, especially the booths, and the little bells that you ring to notify the servers. Overall, good, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"After having moved away from Toronto and become a \"Markham-Stouffville\"-ite, I was a bit sad to not have good sushi within arms reach.  Feeling a bit homesick, I mosied around for some quality sushi and finally found a decent place.   Now, I haven't tried their sashimi yet but their rolls are decent!  The boyfriend got a ultimate spider roll and I, as per Yelper recommendations, the Toronto roll.  I must say that the rolls are decent!!! The spider roll could have used a bit of spicy mayo but the waitress actually gladly sprinkled some on ours :).  And the Toronto roll lived up to other Yelpers' recommendations!  I would have maybe liked for the fish to be less \"chunky\" but overall, it was yummy.   Definitely will be going back to explore more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Osaka is one of my favourite places to get sushi!  MUST TRY the Philadelphia roll and spider roll! Those two are my favourite here because they are always well done and come in huge servings. This is one of the few sushi places that I can just order a roll as a meal. The bento boxes are good as well, I like the grilled salmon!   I love Osaka for the restaurant atmosphere! I've been here to celebrate many different milestones in my life  so this place is really special to me. Their party room is great for groups as it's private but you're not tucked away in the corner and forgotten. Don't forget to book in advance!   The only reason I give Osaka a 4 is because I have not explored the menu enough. Even though I've been here many many times, I always get the same thing! Next time I visit, I will try a larger variety to get a better picture of the restaurants offering."}
{"text":"I've noticed lately the presentation of the rolls have gone down slightly, so I'm going to take away one star.  I ordered a monster plus a crunch roll. While both rolls are tasty, the presentation was a bit of a mess. I ended up leaving a mess on the table since there were these crumb-like things all over the place.   It turns out  that the boss, who normally makes the rolls, was moved to the kitchen, now making mainly kitchen food."}
{"text":"Small local sushi shop, I'm a regular here for the sushi rolls. They have a wide and unique selection and I've found most of the rolls to be quite tasty and they come in a good portion size. My favourite is the spider roll! Service and atmosphere were fine for me and don't stand out particularly."}
{"text":"Ordered two Toronto rolls for take out to surprise my boyfriend.  Boy, were we surprised by the portion size! The other review were right. It was like having a poke on top of a roll. Anyways, we were happy and full. Next time we'll be eating in."}
{"text":"They have amazing rolls probably one of the best rolls I have ever tasted. The pride could be a bit less expensive but I love spicy salmon their miso soup definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"The service here at Osaka has improved a lot since the last time I came here. I was able to book a reservation on a busy Sunday evening and was able to get the private room in the restaurant. The waitresses were way more attentive. I am glad to see this improvement.   Our party ordered a bunch of chirashi sushis, salmon chirashi, a tempura boat and a Salmon and Spicy Scallop roll. My only issue with the chirashi sushi plates was the portions were ridiculously small and there was not much variety for the fish served. However, the salmon chirashi had way bigger portions than ours (would be much better off getting that one). The tempura boat had a lot of variety and the portions were also massive. The roll that we got was actually very good and the portion was very big. I would always recommend the rolls at Osaka as they know how to make it better than many other a la carte restaurants at this level.   All in all, still a great Japanese restaurant at a reasonable price point."}
{"text":"???????plaza??????????????????????15?25??? ???????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????/????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Needed a sushi fix and decided to try this place. What really stood out for me was the overall atmosphere. The quaint atmosphere combined with the traditional houses really created an atmosphere similar to Osaka. You can either get booth seats which are the seats inside the little houses or table seats. The booth seats are cute and have some small curtains.  I was debating over trying the udon bento combo but decided to try the basic chirashi lunch. Served on a gigantic circular plate it came with a variety of sashmi slices including salmon, tuna, white tuna, butterfish, and shrimp; with rice moulded into the shape of mountain on the side. (I somewhat felt that the plate was a bit oversized for the sashimi lol). The mountain was also drizzled with a bit of terriyaki sauce and sprinkled with some sesame seeds as well. The sashimi was fresh and the slices were cut thick. Although the sashimi was fresh I felt that the overall dish was kind of plain, and needed something to complement the dish. At the end you get honeydew or vanilla Milkitea flavour hard candy as well. The food was fresh and because it is such a cozy and relaxing place (5/5 for atmosphere) I will definitely be back to try the rolls and other items."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now, its quite pretty inside. The booths offer some privacy which is nice, but it can also make it difficult for the waiters/waitresses to notice when you've run out of tea.  I always order the chirashi sushi and I've enjoyed it everytime. They present a nice selecrion of sashimi, its always fresh and delicious, and the presentation is beautiful. Its been different each time I've ordered it which makes it a bit of a surprise.  The rolls that I've tried here were quite tasty but a bit on the large side. I udually cant finish a piece in one bite. But again the presentation is always lovely.  The uni, ikura and masago sushi are some of my favorites to order when I can't handle a roll after the chirashi sushi. This is probably my favorite place to order uni in markham! They usually have it as a special (two pieces for four dollars and change) and not only is the mouthfeel amazing it doesn't leave you with a bitter aftertaste."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese a la cart location.  The roll is HUDGE and the sashimi is fresh.  A gem hiding in the rough."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place!!!  Happy with everything we ordered.  From sashimi to noodle soup.  Sashimi are very fresh.  The Uni sashimi...Yum!  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few times, never dined in. Sushi is fresh and portions are good. The toronto and spider rolls are my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a little on the pricey end since portions run small, but it's a wonderful alternative if you are sick of AYCE.  I typically order 1 specialty roll myself, which comes with a miso soup and salad. It's in the ball park of $12-18. It's not very filling, so you might want some apps or extra to share with your friends. The sashimi is fresh. The rolls have a lot of creative selection as well. They give you way too much filling for the sushi compared to rice, so they tend to fall apart if you don't finish a piece in a bite. I love their beef tataki roll. Usually meat sushi can be quite yucky, but theirs is divine! The quality and cut of the beef is perfect."}
{"text":"I took away a star for todays experience.  1. Sushi - the rice didnt taste extremly fresh, tasted like it was cooked then sat for awhile.  2. Waitress said she will refill our water, didnt come back.  It was not that busy. We had to buzz her.  3.the toronto roll seemed different... not really sure, i havent had this for a long time, but this time..it just was not mouth watering.  Other than that, everything else was very good! Shashimi !! Etc..  Still one of the top japanese restaurants on my list."}
{"text":"Osaka is good in that it's got a lot of variety, so it's great when you're going with friends and family that vary in tastes (I.e. If you've got people in your party that don't necessarily like raw fish for example, they have a ton of options in the form of ramen, bentos, bibimbap, etc). Also, the price is reasonable.  But if you're willing to spend a bit more, I would suggest something like WoW sushi, or maybe Hibiki (the latter may be a bit more similar to Osaka in terms of variety, while the former is more traditional and I would argue the highest quality for buck). If you're picky, you'll notice things like Osaka's quality and variety of fish is lower than the above mentioned places. Which is fine because you're getting what you paid for and it's decent for what it is, but Osaka could go a lot further by not cutting corners on things like the soy sauce (which is really salty), which can ruin otherwise decent fish.  I used to go to Osaka a lot more when there were fewer options in Markham. And when they had $5 uni. It's still a decent option for lunch, but I would try other places if I'm craving sushi."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to come here from time to time. Depending on when you come, you can be seated right away or have to wait. If you do have to wait, there isn't a lot of room at the door. There is a good variety of food and I like to try different things each time. The prices are comparable to other sushi restaurants and they do have specials. The staff is also friendly every time. Will keep on going here."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to go here but it could be a weekly hot spot for us! Will take the kids next time. GREAT variety. We ordered the Bibimbap and Chirashi Sushi and the Gyoza. Everything was excellent and great portions. Service was fast and friendly despite it being quite busy. A local gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Yelp was waaay off on this one!  4*s is laughable.  Maybe the tip-off that Osaka wasn't gonna be a 4* place was the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty at around 2pm and I just saw older white people in the plaza.  Nothing against empty places or older white people - I love you, I watch every Liam Neeson movie and 48 Hours/20/20 that airs! - but it's just an indication that the turnover rate at a sushi restaurant is not the highest.  (Most successful sushi places are rammed with younger Asian people.)  Fish was not off, but I could tell it wasn't of good quality and it was completely tasteless.  I ordered 1 order of Uni ($5.45/2pc) and that was a tad fishy, not completely off, it didn't taste like the \"ocean\", but more like Lake Ontario during the summertime.  Spicy Salmon was a bit dry and sauce was on the dish as opposed to mixed in with the salmon.  On its own, without the sauce, it wasn't spicy or flavourful.  On top of that, my mom ordered a combo that came with a Spicy Salmon roll and that was significantly BIGGER than ordering the roll a la carte!  Shouldn't it be the other way around?  Other rolls weren't presently nicely.  Best thing that we ordered was the complimentary miso/Udon noodles.  Prices were standard.  Tea was completely watered down, almost clear, and only refilled after asking.  Service was okay.  Experience and food was completely forgettable.  Skip this one!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new ownership which seems to be focusing on cost. Appetizers have become smaller, less attention to detail, service is much worse. The food continues to be good but I am concerned about the new attitude and what it will mean for the business. Time will tell but I'm starting to look elsewhere based on last night's experience."}
{"text":"Been going here for a while and every visit is always as good as the last.  The portion to price ratio for their specialty rolls is amazing, not to mention the quality of the ingredients which they use. Everything is just so fresh! It's worlds apart from any AYCE I've ever been to.   I generally get an order of Takoyaki almost all the time - 6 pieces for $7 - and it's always loaded with flakes and steaming hot on the inside. I've never had authentic Takoyaki from Japan but I imagine it's this good.  Miso soup and a small bowl of salad comes with an order of their specialty rolls, and the soup has never let me down. I don't think I've ever eaten the salad though..  The Toronto Roll is probably my favourite roll and it's loaded with various sashimi and a few sauces (one of the sauces seem like its a spicy type of sauce used on their Spicy Salmon). The portion is definitely worth sharing with someone else!  Only thing that's changed recently is the removal of the bells from the private booths - which used to help draw the servers attention - and I wish they kept them as it definitely helped. Something small but still a great place for some great sushi."}
{"text":"Perfect place for takeout platters!  So yummy!!  Perfect for sharing!  Now you don't need to feel bad for taking the last salmon piece cuz there's more and more and more!  Dined in a couple times and the kiddos love the udon."}
{"text":"This place is pricey but so far I would say it's worth it! They increased the lunch special prices to the point where I'm better off not ordering them anymore but sometimes I do because it's just that good! The service was pretty good when eating here. The decor is lovely. I love their yasai roll and their veggie rolls. I highly recommend this place for vegetarians or people who don't like seafood. There are tons of delicious options and portions are on the larger side!"}
{"text":"The quality of their sashimi & sushi is something special. You can absolutely taste the difference. We ordered a medium size boat, which we'd like to believe is enough for them to show off - but the variety/selection was quite underwhelming and just standard."}
{"text":"I remember coming here around 5pm and it was pretty empty so we got seated right away and the service was pretty good and the food came out really fast. The decor was really nice because it felt authentic and even had small rooms where you can dine if you had more people.  The food was filling and was pretty tasty. It was a bit more expensive than usual, but I enjoyed the food. We got the Chirashi sushi, Salmon lover and the black dragon sushi rolls."}
{"text":"One of my go to sushi places ! The sashimi is always fresh and I'm just in love with their spicy salmon roll. Their soft shell crab is a generous portion and also the beef tataki is just mouth watering. The service here is amazing! I have yet to try everything on the menu! I've had the spicy seafood udon before which was nothing special. The dining area is very simple like most Japanese restaurants.  I deeply recommend people to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night, the restaurant was pretty empty. Had one of their ramen and it was unfortunately bad. It was like Chinese instant noodles. Dons were forgettable too my dad decided to get a different dish because he didnt like his order.  Not worth going back. There are alot more better Japanese restaurants out there"}
{"text":"Decent sushi restaurant this side of Markham. Came on a weeknight for dinner, and the place was still very busy, which is usually a good sign! We ordered the crunch roll, spicy salmon roll, and rainbow roll. This turned out to be too much food for the two of us, as the rolls are huge! Food was fresh and tasty. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes. But service here is very slow - we had to ring the service bell multiple times for the bill."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time being to Osaka, but today was not pleasant like my other visits. My mother and I decided to come here for lunch instead of going to WOW sushi which is down the road because she had never been here before. She was not impressed. First, the miso soup served to us was cold. She ordered the salmon teriyaki and I got the chirashi lunch. The tempura that came with the teriyaki was delicious but the teriyaki not so much. It was a lot saltier than teriyaki should be and not as sweet as we had hoped. The presentation of the chirashi irked me; I was given a mountain of rice on a plate and the fish on the other side of the plate. It came with salmon, tuna, red snapper, white tuna, imitation crab, shrimp, surf clam, and octopus. I've never been a fan of surf clam because it is chewy but it was extra tough today. Same with the red snapper. The salmon was decent but definitely not the best I have had from here. The white tuna was dreadful. I usually love white tuna but today the texture was grimy and I literally felt like it tasted like I was drinking fish tank water. It was that bad. I had to wait ten minutes to flag a waiter down and even rang the small bell that they had twice. Thankfully, when I told them they offered to replace it with some salmon and brought me three pieces of salmon sashimi which was nice. I didn't finish my food because I was just so disappointed with the food. It took another ten minutes to get a waitress over for us to pay the bill which drove my mother nuts. Overall, I would probably return because it is one of the better sushi places in Markham but I don't think I'd bring my mom or anyone else again."}
{"text":"Forgot to comment on the day we were there. The line was long and the food was so-so. Because the rating was so high, we were expecting something really good after the long wait......"}
{"text":"Still the best!!!!!!! Went here last Saturday and as usual it was a 5 star experience.  The good - Food is amazing...fresh...huge rolls..huge selection. - The kalbi ribs are the go to! - The rolls are HUGE between two ppl get a roll and an app or two. - Service is great, very sweet family...family owned and run place. - The seating is great they have several booths and private dining areas as well.  The bad -Its getting more and more popular so best to reserve seats or be prepared to wait.  I love this place it is bf and my go to spot!!"}
{"text":"My favourite lunch sushi spot. Ramen with dragon roll special is the lunch I always get. I've been here for dinner once. And did not expect it to be so busy as lunch is usually quite calm and relaxing. But the ramen is nice and soulful. And the sushi that comes with it feels like a bonus in top of the lunch.  Quaint and quiet with personal booths where you can buzz for service."}
{"text":"We found this place by mistake, we got lost looking for a sushi place and were so hungry that I spotted this restaurant while driving up and down the street.  We were a little bit skeptical about it, but it was the best sushi ever. Really fresh taste and well-balanced flavors. I really love sushi, and so far haven't found another restaurant like this anywhere else. The booth are really cozy, service is great and their rice wine is delicious. I found it very cute to have the oranges cut it down in such a nice presentation.  Really cozy and private."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 star because almost everything was amazing. As we first walked in we were introduced to a nice looking restaurant that has Japanese style decoration. We were almost immediately seated and the waitress was very kind. The only problem was the waitress forgot the soya sauce and wasabi so we had to ask for it ourselves. The sushi was excellent with great presentation and has lots of flavours. Everything was very well priced. The noodles were good with plenty of noodle to eat and tastes very good. The ramen had no flavours, not much ramen itself, and didn't taste good. Other then that and the waitress forgetting stuff, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"A friend and I both ordered 2 bowls of Domburi and received raw eggs in our dish!! My other friend ordered a bento box that came with a salad and never got her salad, but when she asked for it, the waitress refused to give her the salad?!!   Anyways, nice decor but horrible service and food was meh...  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Great little place with a warm feel. They have booths that give you a bit of privacy because they have curtains.  Reserve in advance or go on a not so busy day, otherwise you'll be stuck with the outside tables.    Sashimi is fresh, but I've had better.  Service is good, but since they took out the bells from the booths, it's harder to get their attention when you need service.    They have a few ramen selections there, and a ton of rolls and a bit of Korean cooked dishes.  Overall it's a good experience and I visit every so often."}
{"text":"very good ramen and bento box in both taste and selection.   $4 for 2 small pieces of salmon sushi is crazy."}
{"text":"Good food, good value...even though it's small, I enjoyed dinner there with some girlfriends in the summer.  Would definitely go back.  Would recommend, great a la carte Japanese/Korean restaurant in Markham!"}
{"text":"Neat little Japanese restaurant tucked in a lesser known plaza on the east end of Markham. Friendly staff and owner; food is fresh and service is efficient (on a weekday at least). Place is not too crowded from what I've seen so if you're not a fan of super busy Japanese restaurants crowded with hungry people in a super noisy atmosphere, could give this place a try. Note: there's not too many large tables for parties of more than 6 I'd say, unless you're willing to sit apart.  Came here on a weekday for dinner and the place was not that busy, but seats were pretty filled. The waiting area isn't that big so if you don't want to risk waiting for a spot on the weekend, I would suggest booking in advance. The place has some neat and simple decorations - Japanese umbrellas and dolls and everything, to make the place feel more 'Japanese-y'. There's also booths available with curtains for a bit of privacy if you want to have a quiet dinner; not like the curtains really help, but at least you get your own area kinda thing.  Their menu offers both Korean and Japanese dishes, as is with a lot of them these days. If you're looking for an authentic Japanese-only restaurant, then this is not the place for you. Dishes were pretty good and prices were decent. Food presentation was neat, although I wasn't a fan of the plastic dinnerware... they're good for ayce imo but for actual restaurants it kind of makes the place look cheap...  Their lunch specials seemed like a pretty good deal. They are, however, only available on weekdays.   Overall, not an amazing place but not a terrible one either for what they offer; would visit again for a close and decent Japanese bite in the area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi and even the rice bowl combos were good. Service and food is a hit and miss, but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Should've made a reservation, as we were waiting in the front entrance for more than 30minutes.   Food is okay, service was rushed as they were busy. Tempura appetizer was delicious, lightly battered. We ordered the small sashimi, sushi, and maki set for 2 people. Rolls could've been better. Came with 6 California and 6 spicy crab? Sashimi pieces were very big which was great. Sushi, okay but unmemorable.   $72 before tip for 2 of us and our 1 year old son. We ordered him the chicken Don buri for $9 and it was huuuuuge. Lots of leftovers.  Probably won't come back unless we were in the area."}
{"text":"After all these years, Osaka is still really good! Its way busier than before. On weekends, good luck getting a table without reservation! On a weeknight like this Wednesday, it's still busy. I say 80% full? The quality was already good and has gotten slightly better, in terms of consistency in temperature of the sashimi! The presentation has also gotten even better! The price did go up a few dollars on each dish but I think it's on par with nearby shops."}
{"text":"I still very much enjoy this place but my love for it has decreased.    I enjoy the huge parking lot and the private rooms.  There are however, a few downsides.  Since the restaurant is sectioned into private rooms and small tables, there's only a finite amount of people (I'd say 8) to squish and it's very awkward when someone needs to get up halfway through the meal (washroom, phone call).  There nabe seafood udon had the fishiest taste to it last time I ordered and I loved it before ):  The sushi is also a miss nowadays.  I'm paying a la carte price but the sushi boat came with very ordinary sashimi/sushi!  The rolls were not special in the slightest: spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, and california.  The sashimi was the same ): not even an octopus, squid, or shrimp anywhere in sight.  The sushi was basically sashimi + rice.  It was so limited and we were disappointed.  Overall, I'd still come back to get my Japanese fix as is the closest one around and the staff is always very welcoming."}
{"text":"Good quality and presentation of sushi, limited wine and sake list, polite but slower service.  Cute decor, and would definitely come back when in Markham!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Been here a few times, the food is okay with decent quality, but overpriced in my opinion. Their rolls on average are all over $12.  Spicy roll combo ($1595) Comes with 18 pieces, 6 of spicy salmon, 6 of spicy crab, and 6 of spicy tuna. Surprisingly it tasted pretty good. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls had chunks of raw fish and not just mashed up mixed with tempura bits and mayo like Gals sushi.  Osaka Special roll ($16.99) This was their local special roll which I tried, came with 10 pieces. Inside the roll was shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, topped with lightly seared raw scallop. This didn't taste as good as I expected it to be, and the presentation wasn't as fancy as I thought it would be either. The sauce served on the roll tasted interesting. Ingredients were fresh and tasted good all together."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. They have private booths with a little bell you can ring for service. The sushi is always fresh and I love all the sauces they use with the crispy \"things\" I just wish this place was closer to me. Make reservations if you are going on the weekend otherwise, be prepared to wait a long time."}
{"text":"New favourite sushi place in Markham! Rolls are huge, prices are good, service is amazing, and love how the seatings are private and not side by side. Some of the foods we got:  - udon combo 6: came with Osaka udon and spider roll. The soup was delicious and dressing and the roll was much larger than we expected!!  - gold 888 roll: amazing roll with plenty of assorted sashimi, sauced with spicy mayo and topped off with gold flakes  - salmon sashimi: this was a special app, 10 pieces for $11. So worth!   Most definitely will be coming here whenever my gf has another sushi craving."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and thought it was time I finally left my 2 cents. There really isn't much to say but the service at Osaka is really good. On our most recent visit we ordered sushi and sashimi for 2, and some takoyaki to start.  Sushi in general is not cheap, and when it is, that usually means you'll get a dip in quality. I'd say Osaka is slightly high to average priced. Either way the quality and service more than speaks for itself.   The quality of the sushi was very good. The sushi  rice is good, the portions are fair, and they give you really big chunks of sashimi. You can definitely taste the freshness.  But the crown jewel here is the staff. They are all very friendly, make sure to greet you at the door, and take care of your every need. They were so good that even in a fully packed restaurant, we had two waitresses taking our order and and asking if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other friends. We arrived and were seated almost immediately which was great. But after that, our menus did not come and after 15 minutes, we grabbed our own. we requested for tea/water twice and it took about 45 minutes from when we walked in for that to show up.  We finally got to order our foods. I ordered the miso pork ramen and Spicy Salmon roll. When my food arrived, it came as spicy salmon roll and spicy pork ramen. I was too hungry by then to care to correct my order.  A plate of 4 slices of watermelon were served to us when our meals were done.  The food was good but I was extremely unimpressed by the time it took for us to even get a glass of water. It's going to be difficult for me to give this place another go."}
{"text":"I cant say anything stood out to me for this place. The food was decent and so was the service (they were quite nice and responsive). If you're looking to have a passable meal in a restaurant that serves a basic variety of japanese and korean dishes like sushi, maki(rolls), sashimi, or cooked goods like udon or rice and you happen to live near by, then this is probably a good local joint. If you live out of the way, it's not a place you would come all the way for food."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great, lots of privacy at the booth. Miso soup taste good, salad was a little wet (not drain properly). Main course, great presentation, looks very Japanese. The salmon and spicy scalp roll looks good, scalp is excellent but salmon is almost non existence, covered in crunchy bits. Salmon teriyaki is over cook, tempura shrimp is decent, not too much tempura coating, shrimp itself is a bit skinny, sauce is good. Sushi fish is fresh. For the price, I would expect more. If it was cheaper, I would give it a 4 if it was cheaper or if the quality is better."}
{"text":"One word: hubris.  I couldn't get to eat here and I already gave up my attempt. Then why write a review? Because I want to comment on how rude they were on the phone when they refused to take restaurant reservations for four. Doesn't even really matter how many people are in the reservation: they don't need to be rude about it like I offended them by asking. Business is booming so they take it for granted they are over-capacity. If enough dissatisfaction comes from untimely service and poor service and poor quality, they'll wonder what happened to their customers and start taking reservations. Terrible."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average. A little pricy for their rolls, although they were pretty big maki rolls. The service was kind of slow maybe because it's hard to get a servers attention when all the booths are sectioned off (which is nice though at the same time as it allows for privacy), they definitely need the call buttons.   Will come back if in the area. But there was no WOW factor."}
{"text":"Time for an update after all these years I had been having lunch and dinner at Osaka. Sadly, I have to downgrade the rating to a 3.   For dinner experience on a weekend, it would barely be a 3 as service could be really slow and the quality of the food can be a hit or miss. Quite a few time I had sushi during lunch and the rice was not cooked properly.   I still come once in awhile for lunch as they serves lunch till 3 pm and the restaurant usually quiet after 1:30 ish. But I have not been back for dinner for a few years."}
{"text":"This place is quite busy, especially on the weekends. But the food is great. Always fresh and great value for the price. We have tried many of the sushis and have never been disappointed ."}
{"text":"Order d a ramen and the broth was no good and the noodles were like those instant me noodle noodles. The flavours were bad. Would not recommend. We ordered some other sushi which was ok but nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. The worst part is they wouldn't take it off the bill."}
{"text":"Great service and received the best welcomed by upon entering. Food was fantastic as the miso soup was not overly salty.  Great serving of the Toronto Roll for two. Absolutely a favorite on the menu already so we tried it. It was filling for two but probably great for three Ripley as well.  Only thing that caught our eye is they do not accept American Express. This was a bummer as it's a business card while traveling.  Otherwise will return for more great food and service!"}
{"text":"Our favorite family restaurant! We go there every two or three weeks. This place is so famous and busy, make reservations before going. If not, you might need to wait a bit, but it's definitely worth the wait. The food is very fresh and well-made. Customer service is welcoming. If you like sushi, this is a must-go place."}
{"text":"This place have really good noodle and sashimi is really fresh. Over all is a nice place."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, however it is one of the pricier spots in Markham.  A good $2-$3 dollars per roll more than Maison du Japon, for example.  Also more expensive than Gal's. But the decor is cute and the quality is fantastic."}
{"text":"Returned here for a second time with more coworkers, and again, thoroughly impressed.   I had the udon noodles with spider roll combo, which is $13.95. The noodles were filled with veggies and noodles, wasn't empty at all. The sushi pieces (8 pieces, I believe) were large and filled with stuff, not too much rice. Overall, a great deal, and I was full by the end.   Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"My mom and I wanted to randomly just go for Sushi last night and wasn't sure where to go! So of course I opened up my Yelp app and searched for a good sushi place near by!   From the outside the place looked like a random cheap sushi bar but once we opened that front door everything changed!  The place is authentic and decorated fully with Japanese chuchkies! There was cute private rooms on either side of the restaurant with a closing door! Everything was wood and black! In the middle a couple of seating areas.  The food had huge portions and was very fresh! It advertised all you can eat but it's not it's A la carte .. Even for the price the sushi was delish! I love me some bento boxes or even a boat covered in sushi!"}
{"text":"good food and service. had bbq squid for starter and it was perfectly done. Bento box for lunch was delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi but on the pricey side. I always get their chirashi and it's surprisingly good and the presentation is beautiful. The rice is seasoned well and the sashimi is always fresh. I would recommend going there at least once!"}
{"text":"We got seated immediately in a very cozy and comfortable booth. The environment was spacious, clean and very welcoming. They have quite a variety of food choices, but most of the menu is over $10, so keep in mind the cost before entering.   After signalling our server, we waited 2 minutes for him to come take our order. I didn't think the wait was that long, but he felt super apologetic and treated us complimentary soup and salad.   We ordered the salmon lover's roll, salmon sashimi, and the volcano roll as well as some seafood udon. Everything was absolutely amazing. The ratio of the rice, to the protein, to the vegetables was just right, I couldn't have asked for better!   Overall, the store exterior may look sketchy, but it's actually quite spacious and well worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I had the chicken donburi or something like that and it was alright. I also ordered the sashimi and the quality was average. I've had better at some AYCE places.   Service wasn't fantastic either.. Very slow.  Really expected more given the high ratings. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Osaka is located in the mall with Shopper's Drug Mart and No Frills so there's lots of parking spots.   Black Dragon Roll: 4 stars  -good amount of rice and toppings  -lost one star from falling apart  Soy Dragon Roll: 3 stars -soy paper wrapped roll  -mixed leafy veggies mixed with tempura and cucumber (very weird)  -once again, fell apart   Agedashi Tofu: 4.5 stars  -crispy bite sized tofu  -a little too much sauce (it drenched the tofu)  BBQ Pork Miso Ramen: 1 star  -worst ramen ever  -no miso taste -overcooked BBQ pork (+ not even Jap BBQ pork)  -hard boiled egg??  -raw beansprouts  Seafood Miso Ramen:1 star  -same weird soup based  -Chinese fish balls  -raw beansprouts -same hard boiled egg   Service was quick. Despite the waitress acknowledging we did not like the ramen (we ate few bites from the ramen), she did not do anything. Overall, appetizers were okay  but the ramen was HORRIBLE! I definitely won't come back here."}
{"text":"After a long day in downtown Toronto, we choose eating Japanese food in Markham, and this store is a charm in the area.  Reasonable price, good seating option and nice waiter and waitress.  The food is the key of people returning here!! Fresh fish and very authentic Japanese food!  Must come here!"}
{"text":"This is my second time back at this restaurant.  I ordered the tempura appetizer and spicy salmon tempura roll.  My meal came with a salad and miso soup. Food was delicious.  Price was reasonable too.  Service is a little slow.  There is a call button you can press, but I found it didn't help."}
{"text":"I love coming to Osaka The staff are friendly and the food is always fresh. They tent to be busy during the lunch hours which is a good sign that people come to this place. I usually order the avocado rolls and the yam tempura rolls and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I am disappointed at the variety of the sushi and sashimi with the medium size combo.   However, the BBQ beef ribs were really good!!   3 stars because of the sushi and sashimi quality, but overall not a bad place to eat with friends."}
{"text":"After hearing some not-so-nice reviews about my favourite sushi restaurant in Markham, I decided to give it a try after a long hiatus.   I ordered the spicy ramen and it was as good as I remembered despite an hour before closing. Only thing I remembered differently was the service. I know it's an hour and a half before you guys close, you don't have to constantly tell me about it. I know you want to go home since it's a Sunday evening but we're your customers, have some patience.   Service wasn't extremely terrible but a star off my initial review since they were so pushy about us staying. They practically gave us our bill before we even finished ordering our food. Uh."}
{"text":"Saturday, 10am. Want to get sushi takeout, thinking of just a sushi platter. See this place, signs says OPEN. Door is open.  WALK IN.  Lights are off.  \"Hello? Hello, are you opened?\" Walk deeper into the restaurant. Stop at the kitchen. \"Hello???\"  There's someone there. She's cleaning. I see her FACE. \"Hello, is the restaurant open?\" NO ANSWER. \"Hello???\" no answer. I walked out. I notice the hours on the takeout menu: 11:30am to 10:30pm.  So I killed some time at Shoppers. When I came back out (11:15pm) the neon OPEN sign was no longer lid.  Later I phoned them to order the T2 sushi & sashimi platter for $35 (total with taxes was $40 taxes). They told me to wait 20 minutes.  So I'd say this is a 4-star place! Minus the one star for NOT ANSWERING ME when clearly she heard me. The takeout menu online is VERY hard to read. Great decor though, and when I came in to pay she was very nice. The chefs were also very nice, they greeted me and thanked me.  The sushi was pretty good. Sashimi was quite fresh (not very very) and the sushi doesn't fall apart when you pick it up -that's important! So the food was quite okay and I would love to dine-in next time. I will update this review then!"}
{"text":"Had the chirashi. Despite being a busy Friday night they served our table rather quickly with friendly, attentive service.  The food was fresh and plated nicely with generous portions of fish and their perfectly seasoned sushi rice.  This place is one of our family's go to monthly restaurants!"}
