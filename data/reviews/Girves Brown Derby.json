{"text":"The salad is great. Drinks are also very good. Side dishes that come along with the steak are good too. The steak itself that was always under season. They have issues with getting the temperature correct."}
{"text":"Went there Friday with family.  I had the Steak Caesar salad which was excellent.  Came out exactly as I asked for it.  Waitress was pleasant and took care of us without hovering.  The only weird thing was the manager.  He came over and started discussing the wine when we clearly didn't ask.  Other than that, the dining experience was wonderful.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse around. Wood fired steaks. T bone and Ribeye are excellent. Portions are very generous. Salad and side options are great as well especially the baked sweet potato. Try the carrot cake for dessert it's a can't miss. Love sitting at the bar for dinner and drinks top notch service."}
{"text":"Although my server--Linda--was great, the food in this Brown Derby was some of the WORST food I have ever had in my life. And it is far too overpriced for its bland taste, and bad quality.  I had not visited a Brown Derby, since I was a child, when they had an establishment in Independence, Ohio. Needless to say, I was quite excited to revisit the establishment in Streetsboro for dinner, this past Friday.   However, I was quite disappointed with the taste and the quality of my \"half rack\" of 5 ribs (which didn't taste like they were cooked on a wood fire grill), the overly salty, taste like it came straight out of a bottle BBQ sauce, the mushy fries, the over cooked rolls, and the dry, overly cooked Hot Wings.   And why didn't they offer Cole Slaw as a side dish with their ribs, like every other restaurant does??   The best thing on the menu was their tossed salad, which was plentiful with eggs, cheese, croutons, and vegetables.  And, after sampling a piece of my Guests Rib Eye steak, I wasn't impressed with its lack of tenderness. Dinning at this restaurant was a $40.70 waste of time."}
{"text":"I like Brown Derby, but be careful if you order a T-bone steak. The waitress says that it will come with a strip and a filet, which is correct. However, sometimes they will give you a steak with no filet at all (which happened to three people at our table), literally none. Even though it is supposed to have at least a .25 to .5 inch filet. Their baked potatoes are very good, fries are average, and beers are overpriced. I'd probably give 4 stars if my $20 T-bone was actually a T-bone and not a strip steak."}
{"text":"I can alway count on my food cooked correctly here. Also good service. I recommend this restaurant if you enjoy wood fired!"}
{"text":"Really nice place,good food.  They are good for groups and the service is fast.  They have steak cooking right when you walk in so you can see it.  This is a really good place to eat at if you are visiting Ohio, a must"}
{"text":"Food is far beyond expectations... Beyond the great value, we prefer to drive the 12 minutes from Strongsville than overpay for some chain restaurant on 82. Atmosphere rivals some of downtown's and the east side's best places. You will love this place. Great wine selection and craft beer list too..."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant last night, and oh my, were the steaks good! Girlfriend had a strip and I had the ribeye. Her steak was just a tad undercooked but mine was perfect. Get a big bowl of salad to start out with delicious rolls. Side included potatoes which were huge! Did not have any room for dessert. Our waitress Taylor was great very attentive. Didn't have to ask for a thing."}
{"text":"Ok, they had the biggest baked potato I had ever seen in my life!!!  Simple yet good food.  The Salmon was good."}
{"text":"This is absolutely our favorite place in southeast suburban Cleveland.  We have been to this location 10--15 times in the last 3-4 years and have always gotten great service.  We generally only get steaks or the seafood special of the night, so can't say much about the other meals.  The portions are enormous.  We particularly like the huge onion rings as an appetizer but it makes it tough to put a dent in the meal after we snack on rolls and salad."}
{"text":"Not super impressed by the service. Waited quite some time to order drinks, not offered an appetizer. When the drinks were delivered, still not offered an appetizer. Once the orders went in, the meal timing was very good and steak was cooked perfectly, but could have used some seasoning. Rolls, salad and sweet potato were very good."}
{"text":"In town on business. I asked around town where to get a good steak and everyone said Brown Derby. Great suggestion by the locals. The steak was delicious and the service was on point!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening and the place was pretty full. I ordered the ribeye and my wife ordered the scallops. Both of our meals were excellent! Steak was cooked perfectly and had the  nice wood fired flavor. The scallops were large and tasted fresh. Service was excellent and I noticed that the manager was on the floor keeping things running smoothly. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Brown Derby quite a bit. I called ahead to ask about gluten free options, and was told that the meat is fine and the baked potato and the sweet potato are fine, so I went and had the sirloin, which was a bit fatty but still delicious, as well as a loaded baked potato, which was totally en pointe. So good. The server was friendly, and I would highly recommend it for a dinner with friends or as a couple. Great prices for what you get. I am very happy that I went and I will definitely eat there again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Nice atmosphere, great service and most importantly the food. You definitely get your $$ worth. It's a must stop for a great meal."}
{"text":"We ate there last night. I felt like I was being processed through a typical corporate chain restaurant. As soon as we sat down, our server warned us that they were out of a lot of entrees but were expecting a new shipment Monday. The French onion soup had a slab of cheese over brown, salty muck. Onions were discernible, but I couldn't eat it.  My wife had the steak salad. She liked it. Iceberg lettuce with correctly cooked beef. Yet, I got the feeling it was constructed with the company defined number of cherry tomatoes and croutons."}
{"text":"Went there on Sat. March 28 2015. Arrived at 5pm.  The man there took our reservation for six and told me 20 to 30 minute wait.  At 6 pm we were still waiting.  I ask the girl that had taken over for the man how much longer as everyone that was before us were already seated.  She could not find my name and I had tell her I was on the previous page.  She finally found my name and told me another 20 minutes.  After 15 more minutes a booth for six opened up.  When I inquired about the empty booth she told me that they needed it for other people that had called in ahead of me but was unable to show me on the sheet anyone who had called before 5 when I arrived.  We went to Rocknes down the road and even though they were very busy they seated us in 10 minutes.   The food and service were very good at Rocknes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Waiter set us on top of only other customers in restaurant. Very rude and unnecessary. Steak was tough and had a strange flavor."}
{"text":"The first review I would write for this lovely great place. If I came to Brown Derby two days ago, I wouldn't gone anywhere else. Pity that I am leaving tomorrow to New York. As a visitor, if I am back to this place, it would be a must visit here! Do I still need to comment on food?"}
{"text":"Ate here on our way home from vacation. Awesome filet mignon, salad was delicious and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a smaller-sized steak house that was busy on this Sunday evening, Labor Day weekend. The food was tasty and a appropriately priced. The salad that came with the meal was huge as well as the rolls. Unfortunately, our sweet potatoes were somewhat water logged. But, at least 3 in our party ordered our steaks medium rare and they were all cooked perfectly.  The best part of the experience was our waitress, Tracy. She was very friendly, attentive, and had a great sense of humor as one member of our large party was practically enacting a comedy special that night.....and it was her first service to a large party since working there!  On the down side, waiting area is very small.  If you are a larger party, say 6 or more, accomodations will take longer and may not be possible depending on how busy they are. Reservations are highly recommended by for larger parties."}
{"text":"The best thing about this meal was the bread.   The service was terribly slow but the waitress pleasant. We overheard our poor waitress being chastised, bullied really,several times by another waitress in her 30-40s who may or may not have been a manager. Totally unprofessional and really set the tone of the experience.  Ordered prime rib and it was over cooked for medium rare and just no flavor. My friend had the New York Strip and felt the same.  This place has Brown Derby prices and Applebee's entrees.   Go to Longhorn or Outback if you want steak."}
{"text":"Overall my wife and I found the Brown Derby average. Our waiter always acted in a hurry and kind of threw things on the table... rolls, salad, dinner check. We both ordered the ribeye steak. We started the salad which was served in a large bowl family style. It was good and we where offered more. The rolls were served warm and fresh. Our steaks on the other hand were a disappointment. While they were perfectly cooked, the cut of meat was not. My wife's had a huge piece of fat in the middle and mine was tuff. Our potatoes were very good.  Overall our our dinner was average. For the same price we could have had an outstanding steak dinner at Timber Lodge."}
{"text":"Longhorn puts this place to shame. The service here SUCKED, waitress never asked how our meal was. My husband got a hamburger and the bottom bun was soaked from the grease of the burger. Couldn't complain, since no one bohered to show up to ask. My steak was cold and way undone. Again could not complain. When we wanted our check and a box to take the steak home, had to ask the busboy for it. He had to go to the manager who was also a waitress to get our waitress to give us our check and box. Saw her just standing over by another table just running her mouth. Worse place we have ever been at for food and service, will not be back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Went to the Brown Derby for the first time. Had high expectations! Started out with the endless salad and it was quite good. It went downhill from there.  I Love yeast rolls! But these were cold. The steak was over cooked. I ordered it topped with mushrooms and onions. They were overcooked to a soggy, watery mess...as well as the vegetables. Cooked to mush.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. The service is always slow, but we have always enjoyed our steaks.  We keep going because it is close to home."}
{"text":"Steak with friends, great meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I had occasion to be in the small town of Streetsboro recently.  We were looking for a good restaurant, but the pickings were slim.  A local recommended this restaurant, which is part of the Brown Derby and Brown Derby Roadhouse chain of steakhouses operating in Ohio. Notwithstanding my aversion to chain restaurants, we tried it.  The main dining room is large and nicely appointed.  There is also a separate good-sized barroom.  We had no reservation, but the hostess offered to seat us immediately.  We opted to have a drink at the bar first.  I asked the hostess if she would hold a booth near a window that we spotted, and she readily agreed even though the restaurant was filling up.    We found a couple of stools at the bar and were served very well made drinks that were amply poured. When we settled the bill, we were very surprised that the drinks were so modestly priced.  We then learned the prices of the drinks, which are normally inexpensive, were reduced because we had luckily hit the bar during \"happy hour.\"  We were then seated at the booth that we requested.  That night the restaurant was running a special that included a New York strip, a side, and a salad for $17.  I was skeptical as to what kind of steak dinner could be served for $17.  Nevertheless, we both ordered that special with my wife having mixed vegetables as her side and me the French fries.  We were first served the salad that was extremely large and served in one bowl.  It consisted of mixed greens with an assortment of other ingredients, including tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons with a Dijon vinaigrette dressing.   The salad was very crisp, cold, well prepared and tasty and accompanied by fresh baked rolls and honey butter that was delectable.    Next came our steaks, and this is where I thought the restaurant beat us because although the steaks filled our plates, they were thinner than what I like.  But to my surprise, the meat was juicy, tender, flavorful, and grilled to perfection.  Moreover, the steaks were extremely filling and could barely be finished.  As to my fries, they were some of the best I ever had.  They were hot, crisp on the outside, tender inside, and lightly coated with some special seasonings that made this item extraordinarily good.   Our dining experience at this Brown Derby was outstanding.  The food was delicious, the cost extremely moderate, the setting pleasant, and the service very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Agh it's not horrible, but it ain't great. Typical large portion of mediocre food. Sautéed onions were just onion in oil. Seems logical to be across street from cardiac center."}
{"text":"Great Steak and endless Salad....Steak was cooked perfect....Baked potato was HUGE....very good service.....would go back again...."}
{"text":"I travel to medina a couple times a year and always make a point to stop at brown derby.  This trip I had the sirloin skewer which was cooked just how I requested.  The second night I had the salmon salad which came with a huge piece of salmon.  The salad was a standard garden salad I would have preferred something a little more creative.  Wait staff is always friendly and the prices are fair.  Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular steakhouse three times and I can say the only reason I go is I have a family member who really likes it. The steaks are ok, especially for the price. I've tried the filet mignon twice; first was really good, second was sub-par. The New York strip I had was overcooked (charred in some areas) and lackluster at best.   The other ingredients/side dishes don't really up the ante either. I've tried the \"fresh\" vegetable medley twice and both were frankly terrible with some of the variety mushy and bland while others like the green beans and broccoli were almost completely raw. The additional steak toppers such as the sauteed mushrooms (which I'm almost positive are straight out of a can) don't really don't add much to the experience.   On the plus side, the bread and salad served pre-meal are absolutely fantastic. The baked potato was massive, loaded with butter and sour cream, and quite tasty.   While I mentioned the prices are reasonable for a steakhouse, it is still not a cheap meal. I'd recommend looking elsewhere, unless you just want bread and salad."}
{"text":"If you ever saw Cheers on TV, then you will understand when I say this place is my Cheers. Everybody knows my name. I am here often & the staff is very friendly. Oh, the food is good too."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to a Brown Derby in many, many years so we didn't know what to expect. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was excellent. We both had chicken and it was the best we ever had. The open flame really gives it that bbq grill flavor. Can't wait to go back and try the steak."}
{"text":"Went in because it was Veterans Day and I wanted to treat myself to a good steak. I saw they had good reviews and they weren't far from the hotel. The ambiance was nice and professional yet I felt comfortable wearing jeans and a sweater. The wait staff was polite and attentive. They have a good variety of steaks to choose from an I went with the porterhouse medium rare. It was cooked to perfection and absolutely tender and flavorful. I went with the derby fries and they compliment the steak well. They have a bar but not much of a selecting for beer. If I crave steak again before I leave this area I'll definitely get it from here."}
{"text":"(I was going to give this restaurant 4 stars until I found a huge black blob of I don't know what in my baked potato. So now we are down to one star for grossing me out and ruining my lunch! See the picture I posted if you aren't too squeamish!)  So we went on a Wednesday night, arriving just after 5 PM. The place was pretty empty still, and we were seated by the interior window overlooking the grill station.   Our waitress got us our drinks and was ready to put our food in pretty quickly. We decided on the NY strip dinners, his with broccoli, me with the baked potato everyone speaks about so much on here. And we did the onion rings as an appetizer.  The onion rings came out first. There were about 7-8 on a pole stand, massive and done in a beer batter. They came with a tangy horseradish mixed dip, which I enjoyed dipping them into. But after the second one we each had, we found the batter got a bit soggy. Now, granted, we couldn't eat them fast enough because they were huge and HOT!  But by halfway down, we were queasy from the grease and the heaviness of the batter. If you're going to get them, have at least 3-4 people split the order. We brought 3 of them home to reheat today because we just couldn't finish them.  The salad bowl came out while we were still munching on the onion rings. It was a fair amount of salad. I enjoyed the eggs in it, and all the fixings. What was really nice was the fact that I had just mentioned Blue Cheese dressing to the girl, and when she said it's a shared salad usually served with house Italian, I canceled out the dressing. However, when the salad came, it contained both the usual Italian in a cup AND a cup of the Blue Cheese for me. Nice!  I was anticipating the hot yeast rolls, thinking they'd be like O'Charley's or Cody's in Florida. But they were stale, crusty on the outside and dry/crumbly on the inside. I didn't even finish one. Took two bites, one of each sliced side, and put them down.  :(  The dinners came out as we were finishing our salads. No one cleared the plates, so it was a little tight on the tabletop. We stacked as much as we could, but thought it odd that they left everything there for us to maneuver around.  His had a good 2 cups of pre-buttered broccoli and his steak, ordered medium-rare, which came out more on the rare side. He didn't complain as he enjoyed the flavor and the sear. But I know he would have liked it a little more done.  Mine I ordered rare, as usually they overcook it, and this one came out barely that. Actually, I only ate a few pieces off the end of mine because it was totally underdone. Now, being that I worked in restaurants for years, I know better than to send something back and be a complainer, so I ate half the potato, which was pretty good (and huge!!!), being that I didn't know about the black blob in it at the time, and saved the steak for today. Knowing I was going to reheat it today made it being undercooked an ok thing.   The husband still had half his steak and the onion rings for today, too.  So in closing, it's expensive. It's not Ruth's Chris expensive, but it is up there. However, the food was fairly good but don't get the rotten baked potatoes (!) or eat the stale rolls!!!"}
{"text":"I was staying around the corner from the Brown Derby, and decided to try it for dinner.  Decor: I was pleasantly surprised by the dark and beautiful interior of the restaurant.  It's perfect and modern, and feels intimate and classy.  There's a wall of wines, the bar has a beautiful lit centerpiece, and it feels upscale.    Service: I sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly, flirty, and a good chat.  She was very fast to respond to my requests, the food came out quickly, and she checked on me often.  Food: The bread was delicious.  It's rare that one gets fresh, warm, delicious house-made bread as part of dinner, and these rolls were top notch.  They came with a side of honey butter that was delicious as well.  I ordered the following: Caesar Salad Tuna Entree  The Caesar salad was great, made with an dressing more on the oil-based side than the cream based.  I'd say it was a proper and perfect caesar dressing -- the only thing missing was some white anchovies!  The Tuna entree was top notch.  The tuna was perfectly cooked, completely rare, and seasoned with some interesting spices.  I'd say it was a little under salted, but that was quickly remedied by the salt grinder at my seat.  The tuna was drizzled with a fine olive oil and a fine balsamic vinegar, and was really, really, really well prepared.  The asian slaw was ok, and the seasonal vegetables, although uncreative, were well cooked and seasoned.  They had two great IPAs on tap... and I had both of them.  TLDR: Brown Derby is a great, family-owned restaurant serving up quality food in a classy environment."}
{"text":"Given the area and how scarce restaurants are, brown and derby does a solid job. Surprisingly busy on a Tuesday night, walk in to be greeted immediately and seated appropriately. Ordered a top sirloin and a rib eye. Top sirloin was ordered medium and rib eye was medium rare. Top sirloin came overcooked but quickly resolved and Rib eye was great. All entree come with a huge bowl of salad and one large side. Overall food and service was great."}
{"text":"Just what you would expect from a chain steakhouse...nothing special but solid and predictable (which is a good thing).  I had their t-bone special which came with a (large!) salad, rolls and a potato dressed any way you want.  The steak was cooked to the proper temp and had a nice flavor to it.  The potato was slightly underdone, but still edible.  We shared a brownie (with ice cream) dessert that was big enough for the whole table, which was prepared and presented very nicely."}
{"text":"Bring back the onion rings!!! They were recently replaced with onion straws, which are not as good. They are too thin and often too crumbly to pick up with your hands. The servers and staff are friendly and attentive, we just miss the onion rings."}
{"text":"The Brown Scurvy is not what it once was. The food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food here. Over priced for the quality of the cuts they offer. My baked potato was cold. The steak was dry. I don't know what concoction they try to pass off as butter. The mushrooms and onions they serve isn't all that great either. The onions were like chewing on rubber bands. Sadly, Brown Derby is only a fraction of what it was originally."}
{"text":"Amazing food & staff, we stopped at this awesome restaurant while driving from Chicago to Philadelphia and it was ridiculously good! My steak was perfect, my Husband almost ordered another for his self for dessert and their onion rings... Are the size of donuts! So GOOD!"}
{"text":"If you like great steaks, go here. A very beautiful interior, with great staff, and most importantly excellent food.  Busy on the two nights we were in town.  Menu also has seafood and chicken also, but go for the steak. Prices were less than we expected for the quality of the product. A value for the money as a side and salad comes with most entrees.  When returning to the area we will go again."}
{"text":"I've gone here three times. The first time I ordered chicken wings for an appetizer, and it was raw. The second time the steak that I ordered was too salty. The third time I ordered the calamari appetizer, it was overly salty.  I ordered the monterey chicken during the same meal, and again it was too salty. It's almost as if the chefs only have salt as a seasoning, and nothing else. On the flip side, service was fast, the portions were plentiful, the place was clean, and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Enormous beer. Not as expensive as other yelpers claim. For example, $17.99 steak is not bad considering the huge salad and sides. Nice atmosphere. They are renovating the outside, so it's getting a facelift. I liked this place. Never been, as the Brown Derby is also in California where I used to live ($$$$$) but this is clearly not affiliated. This location is nice."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse.  The portions could fill the Browns stadium!  I had steak which was delish, though I had to put salt and pepper on it which kind of surprised me.  They do a butter wash I believe.  I also had the breaded shrimp which was fantastic!  The baked potato was ENORMOUS.  Everything was tasty and the service was great.  Kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"Love the food.....Great food atmosphere service. Win win win"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise - bordering on shock!  Backstory: Had $ 100+ in visa gift cards lingering from Christmas (bad gift card user).  Decided to take a chance on the retro incarnation of the Brown Derby - figuring if it was a bust, no money lost.  WHAT A SHOCKER!  The place is nice.  Great decor with comfortable seating.  I had onion soup & the Loving Couple (10 oz. filet & lobster tail).  The soup was exceptional & a great throwback to my memories from the late 60's & early 70's of \"the\" Brown Derby.  The steak was fantastic and perfectly cooked.  Compared to filets I've had at Outback, Longhorn & even Flemings, this won hands down.  The lobster was good - not great.  I'd pass on that on future trips.  Salad was fresh and basic but met the needs.  The baked potato was baked - not nuked - steaming & perfect (seems to be a rarity lately when dining out).  The dinner rolls (weird texture / whole wheat perhaps but fresh & hot) and the restroom (stained, dirty toilet seat & very run down looking when you look beyond the glitzy surface renovations) were the only disappointments of the evening.  Can't wait to go back.  On a Sunday evening jeans were very much the norm.  An odd Medinaish blend of yuppy moms/kids & farmy looking folks.  Service was consistent, efficient & very acceptable - though lacking in the friendly factor you'd expect for the prices.  NOT A CHEAP DINNER....but worth it in my opinion.  Give it a try.  This is the Brown Derby experience that set the standard 50 years ago.  Nice to see them back!"}
{"text":"My instincts were spot on when I walked in.  The business model here is from the 70s before there were restaurant business models!  The place was empty at 5 understandably, but it seemed like they heavily advertise a Happy Hour starting at 4.  So, nobody was at the bar but me until nearly 6 and the booths starting filling with Seniors.  Wait- there was a guy at the bar that was leaving when I got there...a senior in his 70s.   Oh, that reminds me...the business model of the 1970s. Rustic, worn wood decor, Ponderosa ambience, and Country music on the radio (as Jackson Browne would say). Steak is the name of the game here just like back in the day before they f'd up the food pyramid and fattened America.  Baked potatoes, big iceberg lettuce salads and lotsa bread rolls with butter.  Sorry, it just felt weird to be back in a restaurant of my youth.  Although beef would have sufficed I was really in the mood for fish.  They only had two available entrees on the menu but I saw a special and went with the Seared Tuna. And I must say it was pretty solid good. They laid it over some fresh sliced ginger and added a soy glaze.  The veggies side was standard but fresh carrot, broccoli, green beans and yellow squash. A broccoli slaw was dressed in sesame oil and a knockout!   I have to believe when you began to read my review the ending would not end well. I have to tell you I believed the same!  I write these as I eat so it was what you call a developing story I suppose.  All in all, the good food, service and weird nostalgia of the atmosphere, food offerings and presentation was a healthy gastro, cerebral and sentimental outcome."}
{"text":"Five of us went here on a Saturday for dinner and they messed up four of our meals. From a long wait (others came in after us and left before us)for over cooked steak and burgers to forgetting sides to under fried onion rings.....Salad, soup and bread were good  and the manager did take half off our bill but overall not a an enjoyable experience. Also, I don't understand why they don't offer some of the best world-class beer brewed in their own backyard, especially with steak !?!?"}
{"text":"-Be forewarned: ***NO BIRTHDAY SINGING OR CELEBRATION from the staff.*** I think husband planned that... :)  -Hostess a little sassy.... (When responding to birthday question) she also was on the slow moving side... Walked very slowly to the table but I noticed her do that with other patrons so that might just mean she has no hustle. C -Steaks good. A little under done. B+ (Better under cooked than over cooked... But inconvenient to send back) -Yeast rolls were warm and soft. A+ -Salad good. Ranch dressing was very thin/runny. C -Steamed veggies hot and soft. B -Baked potato very good. A -The waitress was very polite, friendly and efficient! A+"}
{"text":"So. We haven't been here in years. The last time we visited one of the quickly disappearing Brown Derby's it was more like a sports bar. Peanuts on the floor, paper table coverings and loud. We decided to give it a try for a late lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant has been remodeled. It's clean and the peanuts and table coverings have been replaced with new tables, lighting and flooring.  The service by Kristen was really good. The portions are huuuuuge. We split two steaks between four people. Two beers. Bill was 65 dollars and we were all stuffed!!!"}
{"text":"This is the original Girves Brown Derby.  It was originally located at Rocky River Drive near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport!  It 's #1 Special is the Loving Couple, a  6 ounce Lobster Tail, with a 10 oz Filet Mignon  at $35.00 .   My fav is the beef medallions  smothered with mushroom and onions.  I enjoyed my 1/2 rack of St. Louis Ribs with a massive Sweet Potato filled with cinnamon butter!  The ribs were excellent, sweet and succulent and the meat was juicy and very tender!  Excellent!  My group orders chopped steak that had to be sent back and the waitress was very helpful in replacing in with another order made correctly.  Prices average. At $25-$35 for the steaks which are the best tasting!   A group of 10 and the bill was $224 without a tip.  They require a 18% gratuity and it was greatly deserved!  A bit pricy but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This new Brown Derby had iit all for me - the nostalgic name and setting with a modernized but not over the top menu.  The furthest it strayed was the pulled pork over a bed of polenta app which I thought was an excellent combo for a steakhouse.  The rest of the menu was great for someone like me who is split between beef and fish - had enough cuts and types for each to choose from.  Highway access was easy - right off 71 and close to 271 & 77.  Layout was great, wine menu seemed vast enough for everyone's liking and the steaks were cooked to perfection over a wood fired grille, which sat almost in the restaurant allowing you to see and almost feel that cow get charred in 2 foot flames.  As for the service, our server was pleasant, knowledable and attentive.despite this being her first go at it, which must be a testament to the training that all their servers receive.  I will def be going back soon to try the grass fed burger."}
{"text":"This place has to be a joke, I ordered the fall off the bone ribs and sirloin combo for 21 bucks. The ribs were horrible and the steak was all gristle and fat. Very dissapointed. If your going here,  dont' get on 8 south and go to Texas roadhouse by Akron general off steels corner road.."}
{"text":"Very disappointing evening.  A group of us went to celebrate a birthday.  My friend had $120 worth of coupons given to her when her husband died many years ago and wanted to take her family out.  She called earlier to confirm that the coupons would still be accepted.  She was told they were still good.  Shame on her.....she didn't get the name of the lady who gave her that confirmation.  However, she is 77 years old and simply trusted what she was told.  It was a lousy end to what should have been a wonderful meal together.  I will not be returning to that restaurant.  P.S.  My steak was tough."}
{"text":"Wow, what a change since my last review three years ago. The music that they're playing now is extremely annoying (I don't remember it being in this loud, and I'm not a huge fan of modern music at all). I got the steak again this time, and the wife got chicken salad. My steak, which I ordered medium, was actually charred when I got it. The wife had several wilted leaves within her salad; some of them were even brown."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Salad was wilted and kinda tired looking the ranch was really watery. Rolls were ok but the sweet butter type substance was not even a close facsimile to real butter. The steak was cooked correctly but I've never seen a filet \"butchered\" in this fashion it didn't resemble anything I've ever seen before . The sides were reminiscent of cafeteria food ,and it's way over priced for the mediocre food and terrible service. Please do not waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"Always a good meal here love the salad to share the cocktails and always the salmon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"There were six of us in the party, none of whom had ever been to the restaurant.  We were all so pleased with our entrees.  Food was served warm and just the way we requested.  Waitress was very pleasant, efficient and was quick to  meet out needs.  We will return."}
{"text":"Fantastic ribeye, very tasty.  Dinner salad large and flavorful.  Bread roll warm, fresh.  I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Eating dinner now and took the time to write. (Yes that's how bad the food is). Rolls rock hard. The steak knife barely cut them. Salad was drenched in dressing. I had a 14oz boneless Ribeye medium rare. The steak was cooked medium and charred black in spots. The char was hidden as the steak was presented good side up. At first I thought glass was in my mouth. My husband ordered a Porterhouse 22 oz his was closer to medium rare and he thought the flavor good. We had no appetizer nor drinks other than water. Decor is 1980s  Service was average. Serving sizes too large and smaller options aren't available. Total check before tip $58.28. Brown Derby needs to come forward to the millennium if they stand a chance at remaining in business."}
{"text":"A lot of price for subpar food.   Ambience has that standard chain restaurant feel.   Food had average taste.  We had a group of eight and looking at how my table failed to finish their food.  I am guessing we were not alone in our dislike."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribeye medium rare, and it couldn't have been more perfect !! I love this place come here every time I'm traveling downtown the turnpike !! Open some locations in Michigan Please !!!"}
{"text":"This place was good. Huge serving sizes so if you're in to sharing, do so. I took half of my plate home because I couldn't put a dent in it. I had the grilled filet medallion 10 oz of meat, rice, mushroom and onions, sweet potato and a roll.  Fantastic flavors and great libations specials. The cucumber margarita was tasty."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  Just went yesterday and the the food and service was not that great.  All four meals where under cooked or overcooked,  One meal had to be sent back.  The sweet potato was total mush,  The only item that was fine was the salad.  The service was not good.  The server seamed rushed,  The server was not that friendly, kind of what do you want and get out of here.  Never came back and asked how the food was or if we wanted anything else.  We had to track her down.to get anything.  They have become complacent in the food and service.  People we still be coming here so why should we they try harder.     We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Very nice cosy and a friendly atmosphere. Enjoyed the food and the wine selections. Very friendly staff. Sweet potato and the steaks were very delicious. They have it all together out here. Special thanks to Shannon who made very nice for all of us. Would highly recommend this place.  Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this place for years and it is always great. We just ate there the other night - huge salad, bread, lobster & sides, steak and side - $47. You'll love this place."}
{"text":"Came in for 10 person family dinner the week of Thanksgiving. Have never been to this Brown Derby, but it was good. Although the menu did not have prime rib this day (Wednesday). We ordered a couple of appetizers - onion rings, chicken wings, some drinks and then eventually the entrees. We had salad bowl and rolls - both good. Most ordered steaks, filet mignons, porterhouses and there were no complaints on the size, the seasoning or being too well done. I had a salmon filet, nicely seasoned, not over-cooked, nice size. Server came back often to refresh drinks and check in on us. By mid-evening most of the tables were full. Interior was not much to speak of, but the place was well lit, clean and not too hot. Not a fan of Outback, where the lighting is so dim its hard to read the menu. Will definitely return to this restaurant when in town and anxious for a nice cut of steak."}
{"text":"I stopped in to see if they did carry out and was greeted by several enthusiastic and worm hostess's. They gladly said they do take out orders and gave me a menu. After perusing the menu, I was torn between two items and informed the hostess's. They informed they that their food is good but one of the specialties was their pulled pork sandwiches, which was one of my choices.  I order the pulled pork with cole slaw and a sweet potatoe. That pulled pork was extremely delicious and one of the best I have had. The sauce had a little zing to it but was not overwhelming and complimented the pork oh so well. The coles slaw was very tasty and the sweet potatoe was tender and satisfied the taste buds.  I liked it so much that I am already going back for a sit down dinner with my son this very evening. If you are in the Medina area this Brown Derby is located right off I71 and Rt. 18 exit. I highly recommend stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"The Brown Derby has always been a family favorite. As a kid, there wasn't a single special moment in my life that wasn't celebrated with a trip to our local Brown Derby. Birthday dinners? Brown Derby. Good grades on a report card? Brown Derby. Graduations? Brown Derby. Any random weekday when my Mother was craving a steak dinner? Brown Derby. Man, I still remember going through the salad bar, while I anxiously awaited my steak or chopped sirloin (cooked well done, dipped in copious amounts of A1 or ketchup) and rice pilaf that was served in a small cup. When you lifted the cup, you were left with a perfectly formed mound of delicious rice pilaf.   Yes, certainly things have changed since those days. My parents are no longer with us. I no longer order my steak well done. There is no longer a salad bar, the rice pilaf is no longer served in a cup, and I have to drive an hour to reach a Brown Derby. Trust me when I say that the hour drive is always well worth it.   The Filet Medallions are wonderful. Rice Pilaf is still delicious and moist and just as I remember it from childhood. Every once and awhile I will do a little throwback to my childhood and order the chopped steak. The food is consistently great. But please don't mistake the Brown Derby for being Ruth's Chris. Don't mistake it for being a BBQ joint that should serve coleslaw as a side. The Brown Derby is a quintessential steakhouse. The steaks are cooked to perfection, the drinks are stiff, and the service is top notch.  Now, in my personal opinion, Girves Brown Derby locations are far superior than the Brown Derby Roadhouses. The Streetsboro Girves Brown Derby location is closest to me and has consistently great food. The quality and consistency of the Roadhouses are piss poor at best, which is why the two locations that were local to me have both been closed down."}
{"text":"16 oz. T-bone = 4 oz bone and 4 oz fat. What little meat that was on there was tasty. It reminded me of the steaks we make camping. The vegetables were not good, either. The squash was overcooked and the broccoli was under cooked. Jacob, our waiter was great. My son loved his burger and fries.  All-in-all, it was fair. I would go back next time we are going to the movies at the Regal, if we were running late."}
{"text":"This is one of the best country casual places in town. Good food, drink, and atmosphere at a reasonable price. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Easy location and parking. Greeter very pleasant. Waitress in a hurry to get going. Very small portions at a very large price. Creme brûlée was clearly defrosted and tasted like refrigerator. Would not recommend or return.  The place was clean; too bright for dinner. Casual atmosphere at a swanky price. Trying to relive the glory days without much success. Not sure this will last."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff. I've seen a few Brown Derby's in the area and thought we would try it. The salad was served in a family style bowl which was nice. The bread was fresh and warm. Overall good experience, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Went with friends and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The staff were real attentive as they would refill you even if you weren't their table. The only downer I had was our server gave the wrong food to everyone at the table but we were a party of 8 so can't blame a little human error."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say is not terribly impressive, but not horrible either.  Took the kids, age 7 and 9, to dinner after a movie.  The hostess did give us three settings of cutlery, but who gives a kid a big steak knife?  My job to check.  The server was also the bartender.  She was pleasant, attentative, and overworked.  The food arrived in a reasonable timeframe for a busier day.  I ordered a steak, which was cooked a little more than requested.  Kids meals were kids meals.   The food was OK.  Nothing spectacular.  The decor was confusing.  I liked the bottles of wine on the walls, but was not a fan of the fake antler light fixtures     My 7 year old son said..\"Dad, I am not sure what this place is trying to be.\"    \"A restaurant, I think,\" I replied."}
{"text":"Don't order the filet mignon. If you've already ordered it you've been hoodwinked. What I was served was clearly not filet mignon but rather a Delmonico (much cheaper) cut. The manager (we found out it was her first day on the job) insisted it was a filet and that the chef cut the meat himself. The \"filet\" was 7\" long 1\" thick and 5\" wide.  The steak also had a funny aftertaste.  Other than the blatant deception by the establishment, the waitress i had was attentive, polite and positive.  Really disappointed that I couldn't get a true filet at a classic steakhouse.  I should mention I wasn't charged for the meal. (I did take only one bite)  I remember the Brown Derby's of 20 years ago having high standards. I miss those days."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, friendly service good food and the steak was cooked to my liking I will defiantly come back here when in town."}
{"text":"We had dinner there yesterday on Saturday night.   We had a party of 7, one being in a high chair.  3 of our party had steak dinners.  They were all done exactly as ordered.  The other 3 had fish dinners... we were all very happy with our meals.   Our server Kristen was friendly and attentive, even though she clearly was BUSY.   PS.... the bread was WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"First time here and wow...what a great experience. Sat in the bar for happy hour with a work colleague and the atmosphere was very inviting and relaxing. The bartender was exceptionally friendly and helpful with asking a couple people to scoot down to get a couple seats together.   Now to the food, Wedge salad! If you like these then my friend you are going to fall in love with this one. Seriously one of the best I've had, my friend got a house salad and said it was good as well ( I know he regrets not getting the wedge) but wouldn't admit it. We both had steaks, I had the Filet and he had the Ribeye. Both steaks cooked perfectly and had a nice smoked wood grilled flavor. Sides were loaded baked potatoes that were good.   We had too much food (and a couple large craft beers) so we skipped dessert but I'd say it was a well rounded dining experience. I will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice simple salad, we ordered ranch instead of the house Italian. Bread came with honey butter. I ordered the rib eye with grilled shrimp. It was good. Not the best I have ever had, but delicious. Large portion especially because it came with rice and baked potato. Appreciated that the meat is all cooked over a charcoal grill. Fun to watch them do it too.  Although the restaurant offered children's fare, the patrons did not seem to welcome them into the atmosphere. ( We have an 11 year old, 3 year old and 8 month old) I would not take my children again. Waitresses seemed irritated working around a highchair.   If you are in the area and want an upscale experience this is it. They mood light the room and have a elegant steakhouse feel. Great for date night. Not recommended for casual family dining."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places when we want an awesome filet. Nice smoked flavor from the grill, cuts like butter; just a great meal every time we've come here (about every month or so).  We have only got the filet 10 oz for $24.99"}
{"text":"Remodeled, and now back to being BROWN DERBY, this is a great place for steaks, salad, ribs. Located near a Regal cinema, so we try to combine dinner and a movie. On weekends they have Prime Rib, and the sirloin is always tasty. The salad and house dressing is wonderful. I've been going here for a long time, and it never fails to please!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, extremely dirty, and overpriced. You can get excellent food and steaks elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. I had to put 1 star to write the review or I would've given it a 0."}
{"text":"The Scallop special was fabulous.  I want to lick my plate clean!  So beautiful prepared and artfully presented!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect any restaurant to be near empty at around dinner time even on a Friday night but with that in mind, I already was here and I didn't feel like driving somewhere else to eat because of my hunger. However, I was still willing to give this a try because I have been to this location and the one in Medina years ago and have had positive experiences every time.  Despite the empty space, there were plenty of servers and hosts around so when I walked in with my family, we were seated immediately. Upon looking around, it's clear the décor hasn't changed at all in the past years. It's incredibly dark near the back with the only illumination coming from the many TV's on the walls and the very dimmed light above the booth. They used to have peanuts you could eat but it made the floor really messy but it also added to the experience of eating here. They have gotten ride of that over the past years so the floors are near immaculate now but I kind of miss the charm of it. In addition, if you like paneling, then you will feel at home as that is all you'll find when you look at the walls. As this is dark panels, it just makes the restaurant's dark atmosphere sink below night levels.  The bar was nice and the steakhouse was well kept hygiene wise so there was nothing to complain there, I did come for the food though.  The starter dinner rolls were nice and fluffy and tasted great even without the butter but because of their good size, I only ate one to save room for the rest of the meal. The salad was a bit on the underside as the dressing made it a tad soggy but it was edible at the very least. I requested the salad to have dressing on the side but it took them two tries to bring back salad with dressing on the side after noticing they put it on the salad.  Starters aside, I had ordered the 12oz Top Sirloin with a side of fries with a pink lemonade because I was craving something sweet. The wait was a bit long considering the fact very little people were in the restaurant. It would be fine if the restaurant was packed but in fact, it just wasn't.   The meal finally arrived after the wait and to be fair, it was underwhelming. The steak which I had ordered medium came medium rare and wasn't really seasoned but they claim it's the \"Wood-fired\" taste...wish I knew that prior to ordering. The fries were great but they suspiciously looked similar to fries I have eaten in some terrible restaurants up here in Rochester but they had great taste so no complaints though.   I might have had nostalgia clouding my judgment but the whole experience was just average at best. If you're visiting in the area or just want to have a nice place to hang out with friends then I can kind of recommend it but the Medina location is a much better option if you are willing to make the drive.   It's certainly better then some other chain restaurants across the nation but sad to say, Brown Derby needs to step it up as an average dining experience isn't always the best dining experience you can get."}
{"text":"Hadn't been there for years and just went last Saturday afternoon.had a really good experience with food, atmosphere and Service. I think that for the price point, this represents one of the better values in the area. Steaks were cooked perfectly, sides were done nicely, and Kristen provided attentive, friendly service. The location is convenient for those living in the Aurora, Hudson, and Twinsburg area. Would definitely recommend for a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse! Smells wonderful just walking in the door!!! The NY Strip was great... wish I had ordered medium rare though. Salad w/ ranch dressing was great as well. Cold Bud Light draft.... I couldbtbas for any more.... we had a wonderful visit. I'd recommend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Brown Derby is a really good authentic steakhouse in Streetsboro on the corner of Route 14 and 43. The service is great, me and the lady were serviced we were sat at a table and the server was very knowledgeable of the menu. The beef, the flavor, the temperature were all adequately satisfied to my liking and I was impressed. Still it is quite pricy...of course its a steakhouse it will always be pricy."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect when we decided to eat here.  The parking lot was completely full when we pulled in and after driving around for a minute we finally snagged a spot from someone leaving. There was about a 20 minute wait but considering what I saw outside, I wanted to make sure we got to eat here, so we waited.  We got a cozy little booth right next to the bar and our waitress was super nice!  I got the fillet medallions and while they were a little overcooked, they were still delicious! We also got a salad with our entrees and instead of a tiny bagged salad that comes in a bowl, they brought out a huge fresh salad with veggies! It was delicious!   The food was fresh and the staff friendly, can't get much better then that!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10. Only thing that went right was the fact that we had a reservation and were seated upon arrival.  Took 10 min for the server to come for drink orders.  The apps and salad went fine, but the entrees were a different story.  7 of 10 entrees came at same time. The last 3 trickled out over 10 minutes, with the last a burger coming out mid rare."}
{"text":"Need a place to satisfy that deep desire for beef? Than mooooove your feet and get in this place. Seriously, their food is fantastic. Salads are fresh (and endless by the way) and they are never scared of removing, replacing or adding ingredients on them either.  Their ranch dressing is....well, how do I make this safe for the kiddos to read? Let's just say, it's like the 60's had a party in your mouth! Steaks are fire grilled and their potatoes are the size of your infants head. Try their sampler appetizer platter, but make sure you have at least 4 people to share it with....it is coma inducing.   The staff is ALWAYS friendly....Annie (one of the managers) is truly top notch. They recently updated the decor and it looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Brown Derby has been host to our golf trip dinners for the last six years. The reason why we keep coming back to this place is the quality of steak they serve. My choice is always the 10 oz filet with French fries. It also comes with a salad. The steaks are fantastic. We will keep coming back year after year."}
{"text":"If we are feeling in the mood steak- this is the only place we go. It's hands down the BEST around. My Steak is always cooked to perfection & the service is great. Order the Ribeye it's Amazing!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Good deals on drinks and appetizers during happy hour (until 7). The food was delicious. I don't know why rating is only 3.5 stars. We had margarita, half caraf of wine, mozzarella sticks, filet mignon and coconut shrimp. Everything was great. So much food, we couldn't eat it all. Total bill with tip was $95. Great service too"}
{"text":"The restaurant over all was OK.  Hostess, waitress, salad, potato  and ambiance was good.  The buns were great.  Our steaks on the other hand were tuff and it didn't  seem to be seasoned.  I had to add salt (I never add salt) to help with the taste. We let our waitress know and she Informed manager.  He was very nice and offered to replace our steaks.  Over all I probably will end up visiting again, but not for a while."}
{"text":"Went last night for our anniversary.  I had the loving couple ($37.99), wife had filet and shrimp ($36.98).  My wife's steak and shrimp were good (not great), my steak was much too tough to be a filet and the lobster tail was obviously frozen.  I like that they include the rolls, salad bowl, and a side with your meal, but the salad was somewhat wilted.  The sides were huge baked potatoes cooked perfectly.  Service was less than minimal, she threw half of our order on the table and ran away.  I'm not sure what genre the overly loud music is supposed to be, Country Rock?  Update:  My wife took a piece of her filet home and I had it for supper last night.  OMG was it tender and flavorful compared to the old boot heel that they gave to me.  It looks like the meat quality here is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"Loooovvveee the Porterhouse steak!!!!!! I have never had a steak where I did not have to put steak sauce on it. It was sooooo good. I highly recommend this place. The sides are fresh and the fried onion rings are huge. It does take a while for the food but it is well worth the wait. Love it"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Steak restaurant and I have tried several.  Tuesdays and Wednesdays they have good deals and that's usually when I'll go.  The servers are always friendly and work hard.  They have shelled peanuts on the tables which is nice when you wait for your food.  We always order steaks and we get rolls that are sooo amazing (my favorite rolls) with honey butter which melts in your mouth!  Truly a great combination.  They also give you a HUGE salad!  You get a ton of food for your money.  The steaks are usually exactly how we order it and the food comes out in a good timely manner.  If you're in the area and want great food and to be filled up than Brown Derby Road House is for you!"}
{"text":"What an amazing transformation from the old Road House with peanut shells on the floor! Beautiful, dark wood and glass tiles. Great romantic, but not cheesy, music.  First course: Shrimp appetizer (8.99), cooked perfectly. Didn't understand why they give an odd number of shrimp (5) instead of an even 6. Would be easier to split the appetizer with 2, 3 or 4 people in your party. And believe me, it was so yummy we almost fought over that last shrimp.   Salad: Very fresh, fantastic dressing. Can't really screw a salad up but you sure can make it a memorable, high quality one.  Main course: I had the seared ahi tuna appetizer ($9.99) and a side of rice ($1.99). Seared tuna was amazing. Loved the spicy \"cole slaw\" and the cracked pepper crust. Significant other had the chicken fettechini (15.99). Homemade pasta, those thick spinich noodles. Chicken was tender and very flavorful. Saucy, but not too wet. Also very flavorful. Portion size was large, I could've made 4 meals out of it!   Prices were amazing for the quality of the food! Had we gone to Steve Dakota's we wouldn't spent double. Had we gone to Outback, it wouldn't have been as delightful.  Definitely a converted fanatic and will be back on our next outting.  CONS: Manager was engaged and asked the standard \"How is your food?\" However, he lingered to tell us his views on the Browns upcoming season. I would've rathered he took the cue to leave us to continue eatting when we said \"Excellent!\" We sat there looking at him, not prompting him to continue, waiting for him to finish so we could go back to eating. Also, I was \"bothered\" by cobwebs on the security lights and around the railings. A simple dusting and less \"Chatty Cathy\" Manager would have given this a 5 star rating for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE the Girves Brown Derby!!!  We go as often as we get to Streetsboro!!!  Once I thought my half chicken could have been done more so now all I do is to order it well done and it comes out perfect!!!  Their dinner salads are amazing and are big enough to call a meal in itself.  It also comes with half a boiled egg.  Who does that anymore?  Delicious!!!  I also order the shish kabobs which are amazing.  My husband usually gets the top sirloin and it's plenty big enough for a man's stomach.  We always set at the bar unless we are with more people.  It's quick to get waited on and then there's the TV and wine!  Try it, you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"When we moved up from Texas everyone told us that Derby was known for their great steaks....I've tried them twice and both times we were very disappointed.  Very poor steaks....they will not get a third try."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here - the salmon was fantastic.    I think there's a bit of room for improvement in the bread department. The rolls were just average.  They would benefit greatly with a sourdough or something similar.  All and all, a great value."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time I go! I've been around 5 times in the past year and the food is amazing. I always get the pork chops and baked potato."}
{"text":"Nice area and my steak was always good but never great. I've had some great steaks. This is a good place to go that's close to me"}
{"text":"Maybe a little pricey but man they throw a LOT of food at you!!! It's neat that they still have barrels full of peanuts to munch while you wait to be seated. We waited about 20 minutes on a pretty busy Saturday night which is VERY acceptable. We had the crab artichoke dip for an app and was delish! Dinner came with a big ole' bowl of salad that was very good(again very difficult to mess up a salad, but possible!!!) by this time I started to feel pretty stuffed but then here comes our entrees...Ugh...I down my shrimp(delish!!!) and ff(always love ff!!) but the steak is going to go home but took a swipe at it to see how it was done and taste... Perfect and yum!!! Our waitress was spot on so no issues there... I think going back is an excellent idea!!!"}
{"text":"I am going on memory here, but we had a very nice dinner here a few days before Christmas. As I recall, the iceberg salads were great, and we had some really good cheesy fries (I think). I had a very good prime dinner."}
{"text":"Sides were good, but this is a steakhouse and they were out of fillets, how does that happen??? so we ordered a New York strip, it was thin and tough. there was a small piece of bone that I bit into that hurt my tooth.  If it was a big bone I would have seen it, but there wasn't supposed to be a bone in it.  I will not go back, waste of time and money!!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. We ordered the same thing and two different orders came out. Knowing it wasn't right the waitress still brought it to the table and ask if that was okay. She knew it wasn't right. We were without daughter who teaches at the local high school. By the time she got to school the next day a lot of people knew she had been there. Lot of texting as soon as we walked in."}
{"text":"I remember going to the Brown Derby when I went to visit my grandmother back in the 70's.  I heard that it closed but reopened in Middleburg Heights.  I live in Niagara Falls, NY but was visiting my 97 and 93 year old aunts, my 87 year old father and several cousins. We were looking for a place that took a reservation for 9 and took a chance on the Brown Derby and they were able to accommodate us later that day.  Although it was pretty crowded we were seated immediately and taken care of in a friendly manner.  The salad and rolls were very good as was all of the entrees that we ordered.  One caution, if you order the giant sweet potato be ready to see the largest one you have ever seen.  I love sweet potatoes but could only eat about a quarter of it because of the size of it.  Must have weighed 2 pounds!  Prices are good, service is good and food is good.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I took my kids, my mother and my sister here today, it was amazing . The waitress (sorry I cannot remember her name) was outstanding, the food was perfect. This is definitely a splurge restaurant as it is pricey, it is definitely worth the treat."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here we had a great steak & baked potatoes. They have a great Monday-Tuesday   Tbone steak special.The  Wife loves the salad. The service was great  and it's a very clean restaurant"}
{"text":"What a let down. No wait at the door, very few tables ahead of us, and we still had an hour wait for our dinner. We had two over cooked steaks, baked potatoes \"loaded\" with unimpressive toppings, and a soggy salad. The salad at least had good toppings with fresh veggies and a boiled egg. Kids meal was good too since we could order real food for the kiddo instead of frozen stuff.   The whole experience took two hours on a Monday night. I'll save a 1 star rating for the worst of the worst so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"I know I said in my previous review that Brown Derby is a hit or a miss but, this place is just a total MISS!  I got take out the other day & the food was so lousy, I was better off going to a fast food joint for dinner. The chili was so beyond bland. It had no flavor at all, the cook seemed to have skipped the seasoning. I asked the girl over the phone to put the toppings all on the side & for 2 sides of sour cream. They put 2 sides of BUTTER instead of the sour cream. The butter was yellow so, I don't understand how you can mix that up.   The service is so subpar & I don't care for management."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is always great and Katie provides amazing service at the bar!  I always eat at the Brown Derby when traveling to Medina."}
{"text":"I've visited this Brown Derby occasionally since it opened as a Brown Derby Roadhouse, though it's been months since I've been there. If the food and service were consistently good, I'd probably visit once a week because I do love their food when it's done well. I didn't have a BAD meal tonight, but when dinner for one costs $20.53 plus another $4 for a tip, the meal should be close to perfect.  First, the Coke tasted like it had some other flavor mixed in. Next up was the salad, which is the thing that normally makes me want to go to the Brown Derby. All the ingredients tonight were room temperature. On a 92-degree day, you want a refreshing cold salad, not a room temperature one.  I had the grilled shrimp with a baked potato. The potato was absolutely perfect, and the shrimp I would give an 8 out of 10.   Now for my two main issues based on this visit. First, the restaurant was warm. As I said, it's 92 degrees out, and although I wasn't hot, I was definitely uncomfortable. My keychain thermometer said it was 82. I complained, as did the guests at the next table. If your A/C is broken, hang a sign on the door and give people the chance to go somewhere else. If you're just trying to save money by setting your thermostat at 82, you're shooting yourself in the foot.  Second, my server Jess/Jessica was very good; however, she continually called me sweetie or honey. I'm absolutely certain she did not mean it this way, but I personally find that offensive, condescending, and off-putting. I'll never understand why people in any facet of the service industry think it is ok to do that."}
{"text":"After a year of deliberation I finally decided to give the Girve's Brown Derby a try.  I remember the late 80s as a boy and when my Mom and Dad would take me and my sister there it was always happy times.  Today nearly 20 years later a true Girve's B.D. I am happy to carry on that tradition once again with my girlfriend, so happy in fact I do plan on bringing my Mom back if I get the chance as well.  Dad will be there in spirit, though I am sure he was today. Immediate upon walking into the entrance, I noticed beautiful wooden doors.  When opening them the aroma of wood fired steaks swirling up your nose is a welcome scent.  Ambience is upscale, yet comfortable.  Dark colors with beautiful tables and booths and bar area.  We were seated instantly as on this particular Saturday around 1pm the restaurant was dead.  I thought that might be a bad sign, but I discovered the true Girves has only been open since about October 2011.   We privvyd the menu online before our arrival.  I was a little nervous because of some of the previous reviews mentioning high price, and well the menu was listed without any prices.  There were some specials such as $2.00 off appetizers and drinks due to the time of the day, but I do believe the prices are in line with that of any quality steakhouse. For appetizers we ordered onion strings and French onion soup.  The strings were a heaping pile and portion, especially given the $2.00 off....tasted good and the dipping sauce was a horseradish type which tasted excellent.  The soup my girl had tasted very good.  It was light on Salt, but ingredients cooked well.  Next we had salad which I found to be a little perturbing due lack of dark greens.  I am definitely a romaine, spring, and spinach kind of guy and the iceberg ingredients seemed like a cheap cost cut to me, I even thought it might be bagged salad.   Dinner for her was boneless Rib eye; I had the same avec half rack ribs.  The steaks were both ordered Medium; and were cooked superbly.  Nothing like flame chars on any meat if you ask me.  The meat seemed to have a salt seasoning on it but was excellent.  My rib addition was just ok.  It seemed like it had been sitting out awhile or maybe even re-fired.  The BBQ on it was sweet zesty, but overall meat did not seem fresh for the rib.  Nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The waitress did a good job and up sold us after we both knew we were stuffed.  We went with Crème Brulee and it was the best I have ever had.  Total came to about $77.00 and I think given the overall quality and what we had was worth it.  I definitely hope to come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Brown Derby location. Great service, Excellent food and very filling. My family and I usually come once a week!"}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesdays they have a 1 lb  T bone, that was the best T bone steak I've had in a very long time!  My taste buds tell me they are serving USDA choice beef.  The texture reminds me of a Ruths Chris steak.   Don't get me wrong, this place is very nice but not Ruth's Chris.   However the steak, fresh broccoli were delicious.    I recommend this place.    (Just don't attempt to walk there from the Holiday Inn, no sidewalks or crosswalks-dangerous)"}
{"text":"We decided we wanted steak and we wanted to give the Brown Derby a try since we both remembered it from our childhood.   I ordered the T-bone, sweet potato, and house salad. The steak was done just the way I asked it to be and the potato was delicious. The salad was fresh and crisp. Very good  My husband ordered the prime rib, loaded baked potato and a beet salad. His was done perfectly and he enjoyed it. His beet salad had greens with it and no goat cheese or nuts, so it wasn't what he expected, but still good.   All in all, it was a good experience. We enjoyed our meals and the service was very good too!"}
{"text":"The Brown Derby Road House located inside a large strip mall is a really good place for some good old steaks.   The was brown butcher paper on the tables, making spills and clean up easy.  A bucket of roasted peanuts on the tables adds to the western feel....the kids will love it, just make sure they don't fill up on them before dinner. Where does the shells go....on the floor of course. There's nothing like walking down the aisle and hearing and feeling shells crushing underfoot...gives it the \"Road House\" feel.    Monday thru Wednesday nights 16oz TBone $12.99 Special...simply an awesome deal.  All meals come with a giangantic self toss salad at the table; only 2 salad dressings, home made Italian and ranch. Fresh hot roll and a choice of a side.  Skip the side veggies (taste like frozen - yellow squash, caulif, broc and baby carrots); the frys are thick cut and crispy (crispy even when a bit cold).  I got the T-bone (medium rare) I must say, it was perfectly cooked and juicy.  My son got the sirloin tips kids meal. The tips came out on a smoldering skewer so have the kids watch out. The burned skewer added a hint of smokiness to the tips (I guess).   Bathroom - western theme, wooden walls for the stalls, clean and well lit.   There is a full bar with ample TVs in different locations throughout the restaurant and bar areas. The only thing I would have liked is to turn on the Close Caption, hard to hear anything with the ambient noise."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, simply top notch. I had one of the specials for the evening - a braised lamb shank that was fall off the bone tender. This was served on a bed of polenta that was creamy and provided a nice counterpoint to the lamb.  Most folks were dressy casual, the men wearing sportshirts and a few nice sweaters. The one man in a sportcoat seemed slightly overdressed, though not out of place. Blue jeans would be out of place, but just. The music was adult contemporary and just loud enough to be heard over the noise of the diners but not so loud it prevented conversation at the table.  The waiter was friendly, though maybe a tad over-attentive. Still, that's a lot better than having to look around for service every time."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, above average quality.  It's all about your expectations.  This is a real meat and potatoes old school steak house."}
{"text":"Well well..   I honestly did not know what to expect, but learned the Brown Derby is an Ohio icon! I started with a nice glass of 14 hands Vinland then waited only a short time for my generous wedge salad to arrive. And it was just like I like em tok! Covered the plate, with generous bacon, blue cheese, and balsamic. I did not eat it all waiting on my next course which was a good ole fashioned burger. A slab is Swiss adorned the patty like a wedding dress and I promptly devoured it! The bun makes or breaks the burger and it was a good one!  Oh and the massive amount of butter on my sweet potato made it even better! Check em out!"}
{"text":"Nice experience overall. Good food and atmosphere. Similar in decor to a LongHorn Steakhouse but higher quality food. Yelp has $$$ but I would really say its just $$. Our table of 4 had apps, entree's and drinks for about $100.   Only negative is that the waitress brought out salads before the app hit the table which was annoying but I won't dock a star for what may have been a simple accident."}
{"text":"I can understand why the ratings for this place are mostly negative.  I called here a few minutes ago and asked if they had a private room for events and dinner parties, the male manager on the phone with me, was more than rude, and tells me that they do have a private room in the back for dinner events however, he can not promise that it would be private, unless my party is going to be on a Sunday at lunchtime.  I specifically asked for a Tuesday and Wednesday slot at dinner time.  His response, \"well then, guess we can't help you.\"  What restaurant turns down a party of 60 people just because he doesn't want to make the room private any day but Sunday?  Poor business, and very rude.  You will lose much business and many customers with an attitude like this.  We will not be dining here and I can see why others don't care for the place either."}
{"text":"Five of us dined here before a movie last night & I ordered the special which was \"steak and lobster\" for $18.99.  It was disappointing in that the 3 oz lobster tail was tasteless and mushy.  The steak was OK but not done the way I requested.  The salad, baked potato and rolls were as expected.  The manager deducted half $ and said she'd look into the problem (in the kitchen or perhaps it was with the seafood supplier?).  At any rate, this is the 2nd disappointing meal I've had at BD.  I'm not going back!  For $20+ per person, I expect better quality and service."}
{"text":"This is our favorite steakhouse hands down, nobody else does a steak like Girves does! The rolls are delicious, especially if they're hot and fresh out of the oven. The big salad with your choice of dressing is nice, we always choose white French, and the baked potatoes are much bigger than what you get at the other steakhouse's in the area. The steak is always cooked perfectly and it's so flavorful. The calamari appetizer is good as are the onion straws. My favorite is the shrimp appetizer with rice and lemon butter, delicious! My husband and I make a trip out to medina for steak at least once or twice a month, if not more."}
{"text":"Something seemed off at this location for dinner last Sunday . The rolls were not the usual rolls. The cinnamon butter was not the usual either. The steak was ok but not really cooked to the proper level I wanted. Way to much blood while the outside was way too crunchy. I'm typically easy to please but not sure what happened here. Waitress was very friendly though and attentive. Also the waiting area could be bigger most of the people had to stand for 30 min. While most adults can stand without issue the issue is when someone who can't comes in and capably people don't give up seat. I didn't have that issue but I could see where that was a problem. I guess I came from an era when you gave your seat up for you elders and women with babies."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing visit to Girves Brown Derby yesterday. Almost everything was underwhelming. Service was somewhat slow with drinks regularly empty. Two of the 4 steaks were overcooked and seemed like low end cuts (both were T-Bones). Rolls were stale. I have been to this place several times in the past and it was definitely a favorite. We had a party of 5 and all agreed we would not go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant hoping to get a good steak/home style meal, what we got instead was a tough steak and over priced mushrooms and onion slop. The reason I am giving this place 2 stars as opposed to 1 is the service and atmosphere was great! If they got their act together on their food it would be a great family spot. Charging 2.99 for mushroom that just come in a bowl, and 1.99 for onions that are sitting in a pool of fat and oil is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but our last trip here was horrible. Our steaks were not prepared correctly one was completely over cooked. By the time the manager came over it had been so long, she didn't even seem to care. This place seems to of gone downhill in the last couple of months not sure if there's new management or what's going on but I will not be returning.Very disappointing used to be phenomenal"}
{"text":"I know, I know...this is a steak place, but the grilled chicken salad was perfection! Great, fast service! The restaurant has a cozy feel. And...we wore jeans in and felt right at home."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here. Everything was just ok.  Waitress was flat and abrupt, just on the border of being rude. She asked to take my plate when I was still eating from it and had a good amount of food left. She reached across us instead saying excuse me or handing things.   Food was marginal. The best part was the roll and salad. The steak was tough, dry, and lacked flavor aside from char. The mashed potatoes had a weird pepper masked something flavor. The sweet tea was not black tea with real sugar and again had some artificial taste to it.  Pricing was high considering the quality of the food and they don't advertise their prices which goes to tell you they must agree.  Ambiance was subpar as well and did not feel intimate in the least. If anything I felt like we were on display for everyone in the middle of everything. There was also no waiting area in the front so you're immediately blocking the entrance when you walk in and are waiting for a table."}
{"text":"What a nice atmosphere!  We ordered the fried onions and they were amazing.   Very nice salad for the table.  The top sirloin was wonderful!   My husband orders the New York Strip and it was 50% fat and gristle.  So sad such a great cut would be that bad.  You can expect some but wow that was a bit much.    The desserts looked amazing as the other tables were served them.   We were not asked it we wanted dessert. ."}
{"text":"The Brown Derby is a great little steak house, combining the feel of a chain resturant with much better steaks than I would expect at a Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse. The staff were very friendly and adaptable to special requests. Giant baked potatoes, and the only reason I don't give this place 5 stars, is that with fresh rolls and the baked potatoes they serve really awful margarine instead of butter. It's a really strange and unfortunate place to cut corners. The iced tea is fresh brewed!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not the former Brown Derby Road House.  The new Girves Brown Derby is on par with Flemings or Ken Stewart's though some small details need to be fine tuned.  My wife and I have eaten here on 2 occasions - dinner and lunch.  Both times the food and service were excellent.  Our only complaint, if you can call it a complaint, was our dinner courses came out too quickly.  We had not finished the apps before the salads came out and the same with the entrees.  The wine list is extensive and there are a number of micro beers on draft.  Soon to be one of the area's best restaurants.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"For the $, you cannot deny that this place gets it done. They KNOW how to cook a steak. Get it Pittsburgh style for a real experience.  I've been going to Brown Derby since I was 8. I'm 54 and well, it's still good in spite of the much more casual atmosphere.  When I was 8, it was suit and tie!"}
{"text":"We went there Sunday 3-20-16 so disappointed.  Sat down took 15 Minutes to get water w lemon. We ordered just an appetizer Onion Rings on a stick because we thought the menu was way over priced!  Got the Onion rings fabulous didn't see our server again until 15 min later told her just the check please and refill on water.  The disgust in her voice. Service and manners from this kid were deplorable and it wasn't busy!! Left 25 percent tip, as we left in front of her No nothing from her just complaing in front of us. Hospitality attitude We will not be back she ruined what was a birthday celebration to let's leave if you don't want our money!! Rude Waitress, Hostess Unacceptable!!! Never be back yr not worth it yr staff cost you $$$."}
{"text":"Great place for a very reasonable price. Steaks and lobster tails (small) are very good for the price you are paying.  A much better alternative to Outback. Service is very good as well.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm the first to review this place.  great food  large steaks cooked to order!!!! I like mine rare and I get it RARE !!! They cook over an open flame. they don't pretend to be something else..just good food at a fair price.... hum i think I'll go there tomorrow.   Love this place"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was good. Pricing themselves into the one time a year category.  To bad. Neat place."}
{"text":"Was expecting more then what I'd get at longhorn but didn't really find it in the food. I will say the service was awesome and attentive. Ate at the bar and the locals seemed to be regulars and were pleased. Guess my standards for a steak house have been set by my home town favorites in Indy, Moes, Elmo's, Ocean Prime...."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Atmosphere and service is also nice! The bartenders make a mean dirty martini! Steaks have always been cooked to perfection! Will continue to visit here"}
{"text":"Its a brown derby so you know what to expect. And it's a steak house so pretty cut and dry. The bar is nice, atmosphere is nice. Its changed its name and look a few times over the years i used to go there every now and again. Staffs always pretty friendly and attentive. I enjoy going there late on weekdays when theres fewer people there. I've never had a problem with my food. The bottomless salads and cinnamon butter rolls are good while waiting for my entree which i always have leftovers. price point is good. im surprised by some a these negative reviews im gonna go out on a limb and say the people who posted em are either crazy, self entitled, just plain jerks or maybe looking for a freebie ? LOL idk but any rate i nlive nearby this place and go there in a pinch often and never have issues so i would reccomend it."}
{"text":"Classy atmosphere. Sat at bar.  Friendly bartender. Had a wedge salad and the Salmon Rockefeller. Both portions were huge. Overall, nice experience."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Calamari ($10).  Perhaps, the most unique and most flavorful Calamari I have tasted!  The Calamari is cooked in a crispy glaze of tangy spices.  Similar to a sweet and sour sauce, the taste is great with Calamari. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Entree: Combo Dinner: St Louis Ribs & Broiled Chicken ($22). A hearty half-slab of ribs and a chicken breast with a choice of side. The sauce has a tangy, tomatoey taste.  Not too sweet or tart.  A good combination and a large portion of both.  Recommended.   Server: Angela was our Server.  She is friendly, courteous, attentive, and gave wonderful recommendations (including the Calamari above and a Pumpkin Pie Martini that was really tasty).  Angela casually chatted and made us feel welcome.  If you visit, ask for Angela!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  We came here last week on a whim, because its fairly close to where I live. I remember going here a lot as a child and calling it the 'peanut place' because there were barrels of peanuts everywhere and you would eat them and then throw the shells on a floor. If they doesn't excite an 8 year old idk what would!  Much to my surprised, when I walked in we realized this place had a serious makeover. A nicer vibe and cleaner atmosphere... And no more peanuts *sob*. The place looked really nice so we  decided to give it a try and grabbed a seat by the bar. They have $1 drafts and $2 apps during happy hour. I had the filet on special and it was really good. I would say if you're gonna do anything, upgrade your potato to get all the good toppings because it rocks! Just an average steakhouse with some above average happy hour specials! Will be back!"}
{"text":"OK, so after a disappointing prime rib one one occasion, I have ventured back at least a half dozen times.  Everything has been great.  I usually get the T-bone or prime rib.  Service has always been good.  Love the ambiance.  The manager always seems to visit your table to insure satisfaction.  Definitely my favorite steak place."}
{"text":"So this place used to be one of my favs when it was Brown Derby Roadhouse.  I stopped going as often because I felt the steaks were becoming very hit or miss.  I went to the renamed Brown Derby at this same location recently.  The decor inside was a little darker and a little nicer.  No more peanut shells on the floor.  The salad was just as good.  The rolls weren't as good as the yeast rolls they used to have but still warm and tasty.  My girl opted for the special they were running that night: a 12oz prime rib.  I had the strip steak.  The prime rib was excellent and was a very generous cut.  My strip steak was disappointing--no char on either side and seemed over-cooked (ordered medium rare).  The gigantic backed potato or sweet potato which was a Roadhouse staple is no more--replaced by regular sized ones.  Service was good and prices were higher than I remember but still reasonable.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Was told 15-20 min wait. After waiting for 1 hr 35 min we were told we had still had a little bit of a wait and they were doing the best they could. Booths were open and the waiting area was packed. Will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm back home for a Browns game and was surprised to see a Browns Derby near my hotel. Having fond memories of really good steak and service I pulled in.   It was dark inside but I was immediately seated. I usually do a Yelp when traveling but seeing a BD I didn't check. If I had read Yelp first, I would have passed on visiting here. The food was rather good. I was only slightly disappointed and that was in the decor, not the food. One helper put it best, \"they put up a good fight.\"   I had some chili and it was meaty ... and pretty good.  The salad was made with care and brought out as soon as the appetizer was devoured.  The rib eye steak was borderline fatty but tasty. It was prepared as requested. Was it a little pricey? I thought so but I also expected it to be. After all it's Brown Derby not Golden Corral.  I enjoyed it and will return when I'm in the area, again ..."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Good pours. Nice wait staff. Good food. Great location. Need to follow direction in the back. No onions mean no onions. Pay attention. Happy hour daily and bar was not busy."}
{"text":"My husband ordered his steak medium & it came out so well done, it was like shoe leather. My steak had a funny taste to it - like lighter fluid.  And the calamari was super rubbery."}
{"text":"Brown Derby television commercial advertising a 1 lb T bone steak special for $15.99 to entice customers to come in to dine. It worked I and 3 guests went to the Girvis Brown Derby in streetsboro  and we were informed by the waitress that their location is not participating in the special. We stayed for dinner but we're not happy.  When a promotion is advertised for a chain it should be homered, this causes customer  dissatisfaction and is bad customer service. I will not either dine at this restaurant or recommend it to my friends again"}
{"text":"The food was very good  Great rolls  I had a steak which was very good  When I am back in town I will be back. Sheri the bar tender was great"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Brown Derby since I was a kid. Dining here brought back memories of a great steak house. Girves Brown Derby did not disappoint. The food was very good as was the service and wine.  I went with my in-laws and parents. I had the smothered chicken, but when it was served, there were no mashed potatoes as indicated by the menu. That's okay though because the dish was still delish.    We had an excellent meal and a lot of laughs and we will be back for more since this restaurant is in my back yard. I love the wood fired steaks!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner....steaks were perfect! Service was great, Pennie took care of us. We have absolutely no complaints! Fantastic menu and very easy to read. The \"endless\" salad and rolls were awesome as well! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Now that's how you cook a damn steak. This ain't outback when I say medium rare that's what the hell they do. Ribeye perfection. The sweet potato is out of bounds as well. Waitress was really cool too. Laid back atmosphere. Watched some old disgusting guy try to take home two college girls at the bar. It was so uncomfortable. My kinda place."}
{"text":"Celebrating a life event and wish we would have went elsewhere. The steak was tough and service was slow and inaccurate with little apology. Not going to dine here again sadly."}
{"text":"Horrible ..... will never come back !! Salad was warm .... was the smallest 12 oz steak I have ever seen ... over cooked !"}
{"text":"This place gets a bad rap and I'm not sure why. Is it a little bit hillbilly - yes. But the food is good, steaks are cooked well, portions are big, and prices are decent. Don't be a hillbilly hater!   Whenever I go out with my dad downtown he gets frustrated with the whole a la carte thing. He says, \" when I order a steak it should come with bread, salad, and potato.\" I actually tend to agree with him. It bothers me that at high end steakhouses you pay $40 for just the steak...serious?  Brown Derby is the traditional \"old west\" steakhouse with big steaks and all the fixings. Steaks range in price from $19.99 to 34.99. Every steak comes with rolls, salad, and a side. The steaks are well cooked - under seasoned a bit for my taste, but good nonetheless. Their baked sweet potato is giant and very good. Salad comes with veggies and cheese (oddly a commodity these days). Their ribs are precooked, so steer clear.   They also have a very good happy hour at this location.  Their desserts are WAY overpriced, so eat up and don't leave room for the sweets."}
{"text":"I have been a frequenter at this restaurant for years. Molly the bartender is absolutely astounding. I love the food and the wine selection is broad. I love brown derby. From the apps to dessert everything is wonderful. Great for any day of the week any time of year. Enjoy yelpers!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience and won't be back. My 6 oz filet (ordered as medium) came out rare. When I sent it back, it was medium rare. Then it came back well done. I ate it at that point but it was too small of a cut to be recooked twice. My husbands burger (ordered medium well) was also rare and crumbly and gross.  Our server and the manager were very apologetic. And took both meals off the bill, but it won't persuade me to come back. We had a gift card but I felt bad using it sooooo... does anyone want our gift card? :-)"}
{"text":"My son and I came in for an early dinner. We both ordered the cut up fillet the meat was just awful tough And stringy. I don't think it was fillet at all the dinners where 22.00 each so not cheap. The rice it came with was so salty could not even eat. The salad was good but the rolls where rock hard and cold. We where both so disappointed. We will not be back to this place"}
{"text":"Good quality, good portions, and good atmosphere nearby.  There's not a ton of steakhouses in the Twinsburg/Aurora/Hudson/Streetsboro hood, so there's not a lot of competition.  When I want a steak, I go to steakhouse.  I don't go to a place that has a steak on the menu.  So tonight I wanted a steak and Brown Derby was the obvious choice.  You get a rolls, salad (or soup), and a side included in the price on the menu, so it's definitely a middle of the road establishment (not Longhorn, not Red: The Steakhouse).  Each and every item met expectations, while the soup/salad were ridiculously large but hey, why would I complain about that.  I recommend the filet mignon, because it's a good quality steak that's prepared well.  I went with Medium Rare, but you should be confident with Medium too.  The ribeye was a little thin, which caused it to be overdone on the original Medium order.  I've only been to this one location, but it appears Brown Derby has other locations in the Cleveland area.  I've been here twice and had a pleasant experience both times.  So if you're in the mood for a steak from steakhouse that won't break the bank and delivers on your expectations...and you're in the neighborhood...Brown Derby is the spot."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and I was glad I did. The food and the service were good. I had the 'Boro' Ribeye special which is a 12 ounce lunch sized ribeye which is the special there on Sundays. I ordered it medium rare and it came as ordered. The steak was juicy, tender, and tasty. I also had a side of fries which were a good side complementing the steak. The entire bill came out to $21 which was pretty reasonable for a steak, fries, and complementary salad and bread. The server was nice, and attentive as well. The menu at Brown Derby has lots of choices from steaks, to ribs, burgers, pork chops and sandwiches"}
{"text":"I am always happy when I leave here!  Food portion to cost ratio is good and I always leave with a box of food for later.  I have tried most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  My two young boys love this place as well.  I have always had good service and never had to look far for help when needed.  Napkins were brought whenever we needed more and my glass was never empty.  The tasty steaks melt in your mouth and the salad and rolls are always fresh.  I can't complain!"}
{"text":"This is [now WAS - see below] my favorite casual steak place.  The salad here is tremendous, in freshness, in what goes into it, and the dressing is great.  The sweet potato literally covers 1/2 of your large dinner plate.  The steaks are always good, maybe not the highest quality of cut, but we're talking about dinners that cost $1x.99.  I think the rolls and salad are better than Texas Roadhouse, the steaks and peanuts are a tie.  ;-)  So this place gets the nod.  Update 6/9/2015 This place has slipped a lot.  I'm not sure what happened.  The peanuts are gone, or at least were on the day we visited.  The place was mostly empty of patrons.  Our salad, while generously sized (oversized really, to the point it was wasteful), was drowning in italian dressing.  Like a big bowl of cold lettuce soup.  The rolls are obviously a new recipe compared to a couple years ago; drier now.  The steak was dry and somewhat tough.  The bright spots: My wife's shrimp was good. Rice pilaf was good. Baked potatoes were generous and fresh.  Unfortunately I can't really recommend this place anymore.  Will put them on my \"hold\" list, try again in a year perhaps and hope for change."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the hostess. Given she was the first person we encountered when we walked in, we figured it set the mood for how the entire evening would go. She was young (maybe 17) and unbelievably rude. Not the greatest impression walking into a restaurant with a decent sized party. Fortunately the waitress was wonderful, as was our food. We all got steak that came out as wanted. Hands down the best baked potato I've had. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered a fillet but was given a cold slab of some lower cut of steak, that was almost 50% fat. Maybe a rare miss, idk but it was horrible. The baked potato was cold as well, didn't even melt the cheese. Denny's and IHOP cooks a better steak from what i've seen. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Have been several times. Food is great, aides are nice sizes. Steaks prepared perfectly. Recommend not sitting in bar areas as service by bartender is much slower than regular seating. She gets too distracted by side convos to provide good service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not worth it. The best thing by far was the complimentary bread, and even that was not that impressive. When I was there, the service was soooooo slow. It took at least 10 minutes for the waiter to come get our drink orders. We ordered the cheese fries as an appetizer and they were underwhelming. They really had no flavor even though they had cheese and bacon on top. For my entree, I got chicken tenders and, to put it simply, they were not good.  I didn't think that it was all that possible to mess up chicken fingers. I might give this place another try in the future but as of right now I would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day yesterday with a party of 6. Had reservations and they were ready for us as soon as we got there. Except after that it went down hill. Our waitress left us at the table for 20 minutes with no drinks or menus and never can over. I finally asked another waitress if she could find one for us. Next thing I knew a woman came over who didn't apologize for our wait, didn't even tell us her name or greet us, and just asked what we wanted to drink. She headed us menus and walked away. 10 minutes went by before we even received our drinks, which were mostly waters, and a couple sodas. She then left again and we waited even more time to place an order. I decided to ask the manager for a new waitress because we hadn't seen ours again and had now been there for over 40 mins and had not even got to order. The manager was great and sent a replacement over who was very sweet and delightful. Our food was great and they even gave the mothers flowers for Mother's Day. This would have been a great experience if not for the poor service in the beginning. But all in all we had a great time."}
{"text":"I have never written a restaurant review but I felt I should share. Me and my fiancé got there at 8 pm. We were seated right away and I immediately noticed the smell of must and sewage which obviously put me off. We ordered drinks (which were brought incorrectly, but that's happened at other places too) then we sat there for over a half hour waiting to order! We ended up just leaving and going to Applebee's and got great service. Zero acknowledgement from the waitress and two hostesses who watched us leave. Unfortunate because it's conveniently right in town. I can't say anything about the food however because I didn't eat any but smell and service alone will make me not come back."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. The atmosphere is nice, but the food does not meet my expectations.  The food is priced at the point where you expect it to be better than Applebee's. I certainly didn't expect a crappy iceberg salad that looks like it was chopped by a blind child. The filet \"medallions\" were more like left over meat chunks cooked shush kabob style. So you can imagine what medium rare looked like. The chunks varied in temp from medium to well. I honestly think the best part of the meal was the big wheat yeast roll and butter. If you have food standards, look elsewhere."}
