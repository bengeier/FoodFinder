{"text":"Their hot pots(Jeongol / ) are the best!  Generous portions, and well balanced. It's not overly salty or sweet compared to \"westernized\" Korean food restaurants.   Jeongols are just like what my mom used to make. Side dishes are well made as well.   My new favourite Korean food place now.  Also, they are not overpriced. All Jeongols are $25-30, for 2 people. (Possibly 3).  Best price to taste/portion ratio I know of."}
{"text":"This is the second time I visited this newly opened restaurant in ten days.  The first time my boyfriend and I had ordered the pork bone soup (special opening price: $6). The broth was super delicious and the meat was so soft that it came away from the bones almost effortlessly.  We were also surprised that there were eight side dishes, which is a bit more than the typical Korean restaurant around town.   This time we have three people so we decided to order a bigger pot of spicy lamb stew, seafood pancake, and tempura to share. The lamb stew is a much much bigger portion size than the $6 soup, and it comes with noodles so it is very filling. The three of us could not finish it in the end. Compared to that of the pork bone soup, the broth of the lamb stew has an unique minty taste, which I'm not accustomed to. It is still good, but I personally prefer the pork bone soup. The seafood pancake is pretty thick and tasty, but I would like it even more if it is crispier at the bottom. All three of us really enjoyed the tempura.  The batter is really light and crispy and the veggies and shrimps are fresh and cooked just right.  The restaurant is small, but it has a nice homey feel to it. The owner is very friendly and always smiling. Prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"New spot in Korean town! I had the kimchi chiagae and it was delicious. Was not too salty, and a perfect amount of spice! Side dishes were delicious as well! Must try!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, reasonable prices. Pork bone soup was very flavourful...not too spicy nor too bland. Had the perfect amount of spice..not too salty. Excellent customer service, waitress was very polite and attentive...will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is new with a Grand Opening sign still in the front.  I came in for a casual lunch and found the service to be very good.  The food was very flavourful and the portion sizes very generous.  We got 8 banchan dishes which for me is very exciting! I got the soft tofu soup, my husband got the pork bone soup and we got an extra dish of japchae.  I look forward to coming back to try their hot pot and bbq meats.  I'm not a fried chicken person, but they had a dish called whole fried chicken which looked really tasty!  Happy to have another go to place in Korea town"}
{"text":"Am I wrong in thinking this is the new Royal Boonsik? Has the old Royal Boonsik crew packed up or is it simply management? Cause they were so so sweet before. I didn't see any of the former workers there.   Anyway, I stopped by to try the new place just after lunch ended at 3pm, and it also didn't disappoint. Lunch offers were just a common selection of bentos, and I wanted a soup to soothe my funny tummy so I selected the plain beef brisket broth stew which came with vermicelli. The broth was soothing and not salty. It was kind of skimpy on the pieces of beef but that's ok for a dish that's 6.99, and I still left full. Appetizers were very fresh and flavored. I was always intent on coming to RB for the kimbap and here it has been relegated to the back of the menu, but ok. The stirfry and group stew dishes were about $25-30, and seemed more rich in things like squid, pork sausage, etc.  There was only one girl running the floor and not many tables there so it was a slow hour. There was one other chinese family eating there, though later 2 white dudes came in. Around 4pm, some old white dude with a DSLR camera around his neck busts in and confronts the waitress in a smiley and patronizing manner, that \"you have such great pictures of food in front, but you need to put English under the pictures because we can't tell what it is! Just saying for your customers!\" and then left. I felt really bad for the waitress since English wasn't her first language and it was obvious she wasn't in charge of the signage. She had also suggested his order (turns out he left one?) would take longer to make, but he seemed to dismiss her and say he won't be waiting and kind of stormed out. I kind of hate this behaviour towards new immigrants or ESL folks and tipped 30% since my meal came to $9."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw that a new Korean restaurant had opened on the same spot of Royal Boonsik. Royal Boonsik was my go to Korean restaurant and I loved every single of their dishes. So I was hoping for lightning to strike twice in the same place as the Yelp's reviews were outstanding.   Unfortunately, it did not for me. I'm not sure if I'm being overly harsh or if I'm looking for the food to taste the same as RB but I just didn't \"love\" their food. Everyone in our table had an issue with the seasoning of their food. The food was overtly salty. It seems that this restaurant caters to Non Korean palate.   We ordered the Jjampong, Dolsot Bibimbap, Donkatsu and the Seolleongtang (Ox Bone Soup). In other traditional Korean restaurants, the seasoning for the Seolleongtang is done at the table to suit personal tastes, so they bring you salt, black ground pepper, red pepper, minced garlic and chopped spring onions. It wasn't the case here. The soup was seasoned already and it was salty.   In terms of portions and service, the restaurant deserves the high praise. They were very generous with the food portions and service was very attentive. The place has been cleaned up and the layout has been changed slightly from before for the better. Also their menu is more extensive than RB. We found the price of the dishes to be reasonable.   I will rate this restaurant close to 3 1/2* and will give it another try as the food is decent. It's just too bad about the seasoning.   (Somewhat) Recommended."}
{"text":"The best korean food at the best price. Also has one of the nicest and most welcoming servers out of all the redtaurants i've been to in korea town. Definitely a place to go if your looking for the best simple korean food."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and the food both times has been excellent. The dumplings are perfectly cooked, crisp and flavorful. Soup S4 spicy tofu with pork was chock full of creamy tofu in delicious broth.  The hot stone bowl with eel was brimming with a variety of vegetables, tender eel and a perfectly fried egg. Service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is run by a lovely hardworking family. Portion sizes are good and prices fair.  The restaurant and bathroom are nice and clean.  Highly recommend. We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I had the LA Galbi, and was very satisfied. Generous portion.  The decor is simple and there's not much in the way of ambience, but if you're coming for the food then all the frills don't matter. The food (or at least what I ordered) was very good."}
{"text":"If I were ever reluctant to having a Korean wife or girlfriend because of Korean food, this place changed my mind.   [Yelp tells me my review is \"shorter than most.\" The way I see it. The less you have to read, the faster you can start eating.]"}
{"text":"Great place for Korean food. Prices aren't that bad, they had a special for the pork bone soup for $5.99. Portions are also big. We ordered the sizzling beef plate, seolleongtang, which is a beef soup and some tempura. The beef was nicely marinated. The tempura was good but would have preferred if the sweet potato was cooked a little more as it was a little stiff. Service was also really nice."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for the taste! Their pork bone soup is pretty good, but could be spicier. Meat easily falls off the bones. The soondubu is also a good 4/5. The egg is cooked perfectly and it has the right amount of heat. They also give a lot of side dishes (we got 8) compared to other restaurants.   They usually have specials that are posted in front of the restaurant, which are good incentives for people to come in. This week, they give one free pop with a purchase of pork bone soup."}
{"text":"The service can be lacking, usually due to some language barriers. Some staff speak Mandarin and some speak Canto, and they all speak enough English to take your order. This isn't a place you're going to get good suggestions about what to eat, but half the fun is trying it all out. Also, cash and debit only here."}
{"text":"We needed a quick meal at Korean Town and based on  Yelp reviews, we decided to give this place a try. According to the staff, the popular and recommended item was the gamjatang but we opted for the soon tofu and seolleongtang (beef bone soup). It was a Friday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was half full, soon after we were seated, the place got super full. We were asked if we wanted tea or water and also got our side dishes shortly after. There were 8 different side dishes which is a pretty good variety and a lot more than I expected. I really enjoyed the tofu seaweed and potato one. In less than 10mins, our dishes arrived, boiling and hot in the black stone pots, it was very satisfying especially since it was a chilly and windy evening. My friend and I enjoyed our meals and we finished quickly...In about 30 mins. Thank  goodness the service was fast since we had plans for 8pm!  I also wanted to add, our table had a built in grill so this spot would be great for kbbq. Oh! The rice that was included was the mixed purple rice, which was unexpected but definitely something I enjoyed.  Thumbs up to Quick service and Good food!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places to go for Korean food in Toronto Korean town.  The sweet and sour chicken was good and a dish that created a great sense of \"pow\" for our taste buds.  I personally got the Pork Bone Soup which has always and will be a favorite popular Korean dish of mines and they did not let me down.  Flavor was great, kimchi inside was good and soup broth was amazing.  We also got an rice cake with egg as the appetizer and it was awesome.  A restaurant really has to go beyond and above for me to give a 5 star usually and hence, why I did not feel like it was in my right to fully give it that one bounce up.  However, it is within my top 5 Korean restaurants that I have ever ate at in Toronto (Cannot count the time I went with my guy friends to Korea haha).  On a serious note, a must go to place for Korean food when you have a craving for top tier Korean food to satisfy yourself and leaves you with a smile to boost.    PS. Side dishes were also in my top 5 in terms of variety and taste within the Toronto community and the waitresses were very understanding when we ask for a refill of the side dishes with no judgement.  Side dishes for days."}
{"text":"So many banchans! The service was quick and attentive -- something I'm not used to in Koreatown.  As for the food, the soondubu was sadly not as flavourful as I've found in other places (like Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu). As well, their kimchi pancake seemed to lack... kimchi?  Overall, not terrible... but not terribly good either. You're better off going somewhere else for your soondubu cravings."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, no lineups compared to Sunrise House down the street. It's a family run restaurant, the lady was really nice and had good service. I came here for the Bulgogi stew ($9.99) because not a lot of the places have it. It tasted pretty good! We also tried the pork bone soup ($7.99) , the soup wasn't that good but the pork bones were flavourful! The prices are reasonable at this place!"}
{"text":"- The only thing I have tried here is Pork Bone Soup: it tasted good but a bit on the sweet size, price and portion are reasonable and it also comes with 8 side dishes which all tasted pretttty goood  - Service was fast and friendly, the waitress comes to your table once in a while to make sure everything is good  - I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes"}
{"text":"I ordered the budae jigae stew (army stew) with a friend, since it serves two people. The service was quite fast and the waitress was nice. She brought out the stew in a large pot where we could control the temperature and cook the ramen noodles by ourselves. It was a pretty interesting experience because I've never cooked my own budae jigae!  The stew itself was good, albeit a little too salty. It was an extremely generous portion and the presentation was great - I particularly enjoyed the arrangement of the tofu. However, I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5, because although it was great, it wasn't super special.   My friends also thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well. I definitely recommend this place due to the friendly service and great Korean food!"}
{"text":"One of the best gamjatang I've ever had. The flavour is good and they always give an ample amount of pork bone. They also give a lot of side dishes. If I'm not wrong they gave us 7 or 8 kind. Price is also decent. $7.99 for most of their stews. Stews also come with purple rice which I prefer over the regular white rice."}
{"text":"We've eaten a lot of Korean restaurants on Bloor St and North York, and this Korean family run restaurant is our new favorite!  Excellent service, wonderful taste and clean everywhere!  They offer 6 to 8 side dishes which are all handmade, delicious, and can refill if needed for free.  We've came twice and tried pork bone soup, large portion, great taste; Jjamppong, spicy seafood noodles, my favorite, soup is so great, with sufficient seafood properly cooked; Kimchi Jigae, and soft tofu soup, both are wonderful; Tempura, crispy and not oily. Doesn't like some restaurants that use a lot MSG, their food taste as what food should be, genuinely good. It's brand opening with random promotions going on, e.g. Pork bone soup $5.99 or soft tofu soup $6.99 etc, go inside and check out what they have on promotion that day!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Korean food places I've tried. Excellent and delicious food, friendly and accomodating staff and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came into Jin Dal Lae for the reviews on a Sunday afternoon where it was literally 28 degrees outside.  Walking in it was packed (always a good sign!) but it was just as hot inside as outside!!! That was a definite no no as I don't want to be sweating and eating.  The service is really good. The waiter got us seated quickly, took our menu, and checked up on us regularly.  I got the japchae & my boyfriend got beef fried rice.  1. The japchae was delicious. Exactly how I wanted it. The portions were huge as well. However, there was like 3 pieces of beef with 2 pieces of the chewy fungus.  Definitely expected more protein in there.  I loved the flavoring of the dish though. 2. The fried rice my boyfriend got was subpar.  He didn't enjoy the purple fried rice (I did though!) and there was a sprinkling of beef in there... Not filling and quite disappointing.   3. There were 8 banchans!  4. Water offered was luke warm when I needed it to be Antarctica ice cold. :(   There was also 3 flies battling above our heads so we had to keep dodging them as well.  For both dishes it came to $27.   I'll definitely come back when it's colder to try their soups. But I hope they get AC for their summer customers!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and were seated immediately. Vast selection of side dishes which I like. Prices are reasonable too. The waitress was very polite and sweet, she even offered if we wanted a second set of side dishes."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling, I wanted to have some comfort food. Naturally I wanted Korean food... more specifically, sundubu jigae (soft tofu stew). I wasn't let down at all. The outside of the restaurant doesn't really look much but don't be deceived.   My tofu jigae was so flavorful. It was the right amount of spice and richness... couldn't stop eating! Ended up burning my tongue but it was worth it. Haha. My friend ordered bulgogi and we shared a haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) together. Food was top notch. If I'm ever back in Toronto I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! And it's super cheap! I got the LA galbi and it really hit the spot. I'm pretty picky with my galbi too.   My bf got the dolsot bibimbap and it was standard. Pretty good.   Tons of side dishes and the service was great!  Unlimited sides and tea!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork bone soup and was not disappointed. It was delicious, filling, and super cheap. Btw they take debit card and VISA!  The portion size is HUGE! If you eat a lot, you will be full. If you don't eat that much, you'll basically be able to take home enough for full meal.   The broth wasn't too spicy but still flavorful, which was great. I found it strange that this place doesn't ask for your spice preference. I guess everything is mild and you can add their spicy sauce afterwards at your own leisure."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Korean town for pork bone soup and rice stick. Yummy food, Clean place and fast service by a family."}
{"text":"Still my favourite place in the area to get gamjatang (pork bone soup) and enjoy a huge variety of side dishes. Service is still top notch. You will definitely enjoy the food and get full here!"}
