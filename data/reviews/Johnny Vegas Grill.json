{"text":"Delicious, and gross food..so greasy, but so so decadent. I think the Johnny Vegas Fries did me in..and threw me over the edge. So much wonderful fat. If I hadn't of been drinking, I may have not lost it..but my god it was all so amazing. The burger was just like I ordered, rare, with bacon, and pepper jack cheese, the corn dog was fabulous (but the stick hilariously broke on me), the fried pickles were an unexpected treat, and those fries..a hedonistic gut bomb of bacon, cheese, and a flavorful, creamy condiment sauce that take the whole dish to heights of belly devastating satisfaction, and suffering. I loved every bite, but regretted the hell out of it later. I'll say about Johnny Vegas Grill, exactly what I'd have said about my favorite ex boyfriend, \"I hate myself for loving you.\" ..but I keep coming back for more.  4 stars because I found a piece of steel wool in one of their burgers once. I really enjoyed the fries and that burger, or I wouldn't have given them another chance. Their food has become something of an addiction. I enjoy living dangerously, I guess. haha"}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese bites were pretty good, thought they would be better but still enjoyed them, but the pizza wasn't the best. Overall a good place but would choose a different place to eat pizza at."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I highly recommend the Johnny Vegas Fries... They taste amazing! By far the best fries I've had here in Vegas and I've tried several local places in town since moving here. The onion rings and 2ton Quesadilla are also some of my menu favorites. The quesadilla comes with pepperoni, cheese, sausage, bacon and sauce... Definitely, something I will be ordering again. The delivery guy was cool, and the order arrived on time..  Overall, I was impressed. I'm probably laying it on a little thick, but what I can say.. The food was really good"}
{"text":"Dude bro man dude such good pizza pepperoni and mushrooms with some cheese sticks. I'm so wit it getting them again. The delivery driver was fast as $hit pizza was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"The delivery service was AMAZING! And the food was hot and delish! This is the first time ordering from this place and my husband and I absolutely loved it! We order the Philly Cheesesteak, BLT with the famous Johnny Vegas Fries and finally fried mushrooms! Omg it was good and we still have some left over most definitely the place to go for delivery if you really want to satisfy your hunger  PS they surprised us with tootsie rolls I haven't had any in hella long! Thanks for the childhood memories!"}
{"text":"This place was inside of a dive bar called Mr. G's. This was a nice find near my place for some slightly better than average bar food, a beer, and to see a game. The creative JVG fries are my favorite menu item so far.  I ordered hot wings, cheese pizza, and philly cheese steak fries. Wings=the wings were big which I did not like.  They were breaded and then dipped in hot sauce. I am a naked wing fan. The wing sauce was a good flavor.  I will not order the wings again. Philly fries= I will order this again.  Fries cooked well and the philly steak meat had a good flavor. Cheese pizza= i will not order this item again.  The pizza was sprinkled with italian seasoning and garlic which was good. The cheese was great, the sauce was decent, but the crust ruined the pizza.  It seemed like a stiff frozen pizza crust like red baron freezer pizza. I requested a side of marinara which was the same as what was used on the pizza so I doubt the entire pizza was frozen and cooked. JVG please change the pizza crust... It is not good... At all. I would compare this place to the food place in Rum Runner near the corner of boulder and gibson. Although I need to try a JVG burger and some other items to make a full assessment. Recision to come on my next visit."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place......My husband and i have been following this place for years.Every time we come into town our first place is JVG ...Burgers fries and burgers and fries, the home made sauce is better than my mothers which we order on everything ......we  live in Utah and always look forward to eating there all during are vacation. Thank you for the excellent food and always have no room left so happy the cheese cake to go."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a very long time. The food here is always delicious. They have the best Philly, Mr. G's Burger and the Johnny Vegas Fries are amazing! A must try :) They have a great staff. Not to mention the owners are really nice people, who genuinely care about their food. If you're in the neighborhood stop in for a bite, if not they have really cool delivery drivers who've never let me down. Thank You JVG"}
{"text":"The food is always great! I have even ordered for friends and they love it! Only one downside to ordering for delivery... Says minimum order for delivery is $15, then you complete your order and at checkout it says minimum is $20. When ordering for only yourself and no time to pick up the order, I had no choice but to order stuff I don't need/want like soda and dessert.   Otherwise, like stated before... food is great! Delivery time is usually faster than what they say, and that's always a good surprise."}
{"text":"Omg i LOVE this place! The food is outstanding the service is really great they are VERY a tentative...it's just an all around wonderful place...they definitely exceed my expectations EVERY time without skipping a beat! I HIGHLY recommend this place...you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Food tastes so amazing!! Italian Philly bomb Johnny's Vegas fries... OMG!! The cheese pizza so fresh and the best thing 2 ton quesadilla wow!!! Fast delivery super awesome."}
{"text":"First time ordering and have to say I'm pretty impressed. We ordered the Build your own burger with the upgrade to Vegas fries which are TOTALLY worth the $3.00 charge. The burger was great. Charbroiled, cooked perfectly. The bun was fresh and soft. We also ordered a Cesar salad and an order of the BBQ Chicken fries. The salad was simple and fresh and the ranch dressing is awesome!. Finally the chicken fries I ordered with onions and jalapeños. They use pickled jalapeños which I wish I would have known and skipped. But over all they were really good. Good amount of chicken, sweet and tangy BBQ sauce and a lot of cheese. I look forward to trying the other fries soon. We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Would give it 3 1/2 for the 1:15 delivery time. WAY TOO LONG! However, due to some reviews on grub hub and EAT 24 Las Vegas, Iheard this place is gross. But this place is amazing! My boyfriend and his friend order with me and we practically got everything. Lol DONG KNOCK IT TIL YOU TRY IT! AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place me and my boyfriend are addicted to the Johnny vegas fries. The homemade mayo is the best!! Bacon is on point!!!! And I love how easy it is to order from yelp and then can track my order."}
{"text":"Hand's Down yes this is the BEST Pizza place EVER............but delivery takes forever. Although the Johnny's fries are worth it"}
{"text":"This is the best place in town,had delivery last night what great food this place always puts out. Had the wings biggest and the best,and my man's Philly was off the wall with the side of Vegas fries,my son had Johnny Vegas fries he said mommy can we order there tomorrow night,well newer to town found my place to eat portions are huge love it great job and very pleasant driver."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering with this restaurant. I ordered through Eat24, so I was kind of hesitant on if my order was going to come out correctly. Not only did it come out correctly, it was 30 minutes early!!! It was absolutely delicious! I didn't like the Fried Mac-n-cheese but that's just me. The burger was soggy at the bottom but it was still so delicious.   Update: I thought the burger I ordered came out correctly. I had only taken two bites. Turns out it was 90% rare. When I called Johnny about this, they gave me some of the best customer service I could possibly get. This definitely won't stop me from ordering here again. Great experience!"}
{"text":"FAST and FREE delivery.  I think mac and cheese bites might be one of my favorite foods now.  The Johnny Vegas Burger is a solid burger with good flavors. Really good customer service too! They messed up and gave me fries instead of onion ring (I hate fries.) I didn't want to wait because I was too hungry so I said it's ok. Then 10 minutes later the delivery guy brings me onion rings! Thanks delivery guy."}
{"text":"First time ordering, pizza is full of cheese and toppings.  Cheese steak is great little greasy over all good and ez process. If I can give my two cents cause it is a review lol, we had to repeat our order 3x cause the guy on the phone was yelling at another employee. Could have waited til he was off the phone.  Probably will order again. Delivery was free but there is a 1$/take out charge. Happy tho.  Thx guys"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time my BF and I have ordered delivery from this place and let me tell you it is delicious! We ordered Pizza (Hawaiian with Jalapenos) a Cesar's salad and a Steak Sandwich. They always deliver on time and it is always fresh. Love it! Oh and the delivery part is a big PLUS! Thank you Johnny Vegas Grill for the fresh, delicious food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Great time on delivery. Love the Philly Steak sandwich and fried raviollis and sauce. Ordering again!"}
{"text":"I order delivery A LOT. It gets screwed up MORE than a lot, (*cough* Postmates *cough*). I never post reviews, even when things are botched irrevocably. But I have to make my first post to say how pleased I am with this place. I sound like a shill, but I swear I'm not. After midnight, craving a burger, thought I'd try this. I'm not Sally from \"When Harry Met Sally,\" but I have some requests. Every single one was fulfilled. Burger was perfectly cooked, all extras were AMPLY included, and everything was delicious. Delivery was quick & friendly. I'll be using this place much more in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing food here!! Had the meat lovers pizza delivered, it was fast and the pizza was perfect, absolutely huge. We've had burgers, cheesesteaks, fried pickles, JVG fries, pizza quesadillas, and a few other items...everything is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Food always arrives on time,  philly cheese steak is a must have!!!...everything I've had so far is really good!...thank you jhonny Vegas grill, keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers and fries I've had. The chicken fingers tasted great, had an awesome crispy breading with juicy chicken inside. The fries were fresh & crispy as well. I'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Updating my review, the food wasn't the best but I guess every place has its days. The main reason I'm updating this review is because when I wrote a negative review about the food and how me and my family weren't impressed, Johnny attempted to call me and also responded to my review offering to make it right. You don't see that often so while I can't talk my husband or son into eating here again even if for free, that type of customer service shows a whole lot about a place and how it's run. Plus there aren't many bad things I've read about this place. Like I said every place has a bad day, or order in my case but the way he tried to make it right impressed me. Maybe I'll stop in one day when I'm alone and bring home my leftovers and then prove my family wrong. Thanks again for the great customer service it was much appreciated"}
{"text":"I learned about Johnny Vegas Grill (JVG) through Yelp, of course. Very positive reviews from patrons, with many giving  4 or 5 stars. So, two days ago, I had a craving for pizza and burgers, and really I just wanted to indulge in good food.    I looked over the JVG menu on Yelp and was impressed by the limitless number of food options available. This establishment offers everything, from pizza, burgers, hot sandwiches, salads, and deli sandwiches, to battered fish, chicken strips, fries, onion rings, wings and a variety of appetizers. I'm a foodie,  with a palate for all sorts of foods/cuisines, so I love this.   I placed my first order from JVG through Yelp eat24. I chose the 16 inch ultimate pizza,  2 JVG burgers (these are build-your-own burger's) garlic bread, and an order of their fish and chips. For one burger I added american cheese and bacon (both of which were an additional .95 cents charge) grilled onions, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo and mustard. The second one, which was for my daughter, was to include american cheese, mushrooms, jalapeños, grilled onions, bacon and lettuce. The jalapeños, grilled onions, bacon and mushrooms were also an additional .95 cents each. My total came to nearly $60. There was no delivery charge.  The delivery quote time was average, 45-55 minutes. So, I was impressed when my food arrived within 30 minutes, possibly less! Seriously, it seemed like jet fast delivery! Score!!   Upon first glance, the food was hot! I looked over the pizza first, since that's the main thing I wanted. It had all the toppings for an ultimate/supreme pizza, but, it just didn't look too appealing. It looked like a frozen pizza. I lifted the pizza up to check the bottom crust and it felt really hard, just like frozen pizza crust. I'm worried at this point because being a yelp browser, I recently came across a reviewer who claimed that the pizza from JVG  he/she had ordered tasted like a frozen \"Red Barron\" pizza. I tasted a slice, and low and behold, that's exactly what it reminded me of...Red Barron, which I'm familiar with because I only buy that brand. So, I was disappointed because at $18.99 for a 16 inch, I was looking for \"real\" pizza. I felt it was way over-priced, and wished I'd just made my own.  About 3 hours later, I reheated a slice and was completely disgusted. The crust (also mentioned by another reviewer) was completely undercooked. It was soggy, mushy, just absolutely gross. In all honesty, this is the worst pizza I've ever eaten. The pizza alone, I felt was just a 1 star. I would never order it again.  The burger's- my daughter's burger should have had cheese on it. There was none. The bottom bun was soggy, inedible. She had to remove it and just eat the burger without the bottom bun. I thought my burger patty tasted burnt. I didn't enjoy it because of this. But I did eat it all, wasn't so bad that it was inedible. Overall, even with having to remove the soggy bun, my daughter still enjoyed her burger.   The fish and chips- these were OK. The dish came with tarter sauce and malt vinegar. The fries had Italian seasoning sprinkled on them, the fish was alright (you get four) but not something I'd order again. I'd agree with the price had the dish been outstanding.  Garlic Bread- It was OK. Had Italian seasoning on it. Looked and tasted like garlic bread and the cost was reasonable.  I gave JVG 3 stars. The three stars, for the most part, are for the outstanding customer service they displayed. I did call in to tell them about my daughter's burger. They were very friendly and apologetic and offered to remake the burger or refund me, all at their travel expense. I opted to have the refund since my daughter found a way to eat the burger and plus we had food from another establishment, as well. Within 40 minutes they were at my door with my refund and also brought me a Hershey's candy bar. I really appreciated that. They did what any GOOD business would do. Just the customer service alone would be a reason I'd return here. I'm big on how businesses treat patrons and in my book, JVG gets 5 stars for it. Hands down.   So, in summary, I felt the pizza was a major let down. I think it should have been cooked longer and I agree with another reviewer that if they worked on the crust, JVG's pizza would be amazing!! The toppings were excellent! Would I return? I think I would. As I stated above, they offer a multitude of dishes, and I'd be willing to try some of them. I'm seeing from the Yelp reviews that they make a mean cheese steak! Wouldn't mind trying it."}
{"text":"This is for the delivery.  Pizza was absolutely horrible it had soo much cheese on it and it was completely uneatable.  Again soooo much cheese and it was just pure white with out any browning.  The Pepperoni Pizza Quesadilla was just a complete joke. I will never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling, my wife and I did not feel like going out to eat, so we looked for delivery on YELP and came across this restaurant. It seemed to be a typical All-American burger joint/bar food type of place but the exceptional reviews for the fried mushrooms and loaded fries intrigued me. We ordered the chicken ranch fries, philly cheesesteak sandwich (with onion and mushrooms), fried mushrooms, crispy chicken salad, and a side of hot BBQ sauce. We received our order quicker than I expected from a very friendly fellow. We found the chicken ranch fries to be phenomenal and can understand the great reviews. Also, the fried mushrooms were absolutely fantastic with the homemade sauce which was very good on its own. The philly cheesesteak was okay. It was hot and edible but nothing special. The same can be said about the crispy chicken salad as it was a little bit of chicken with a whole lot of lettuce. The hot BBQ sauce as a salad dressing was the only saving grace for the salad. Overall, Johnny's Grill is worth it for the loaded fries and fried mushrooms if you want quick food and delivery. It definitely fit with the previous reviews and I would recommend Johnny's."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It's inside a pub. The food was fresh and hot! The Philly and fries are bomb and the service was great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Philly cheese steak and fries were done right. Staff was friendly and had the food ready quickly.  It's a hole in the wall, but don't let that keep you away, it's no glory hole."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff are friendly and on time. Always bring the right order. Highly recommend eating their delious food."}
{"text":"I had their Mr. G's burger. It was pretty good and one of the best burgers that I've had in the area. The only issue I had with it was that the bottom bun was soggy due to all the toppings included. Other than that, it was good quality meat and cooked precisely as I requested: medium well. Many places can't do medium well right and make it well done. The onion rings that came with it were also delicious and the batter was good. To top it off, the service was very friendly and they cooked that burger pretty fast. I'll be returning to try their philly steak. The way how he was described it when I asked him what to try next time with some marinara sauce sounded delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Killer stuff. Get you some. Long day at work? End of a big wave of BS? Grab you a 6er of some good brew, roll up some good buds, and grub on some killer food"}
{"text":"The food I had was delicious I would order from them again. The wings are juicy and have a nice crunch to them. I also had the johnny vegas fries they tasted okay I feel it could have been better. Now I'm itching to try the pizza hopefully I'm not disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after a long night. Pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed the cheese steak and philly fries while the kiddos had the pizza with the husband. It wasn't sloppy like a lot of places I eat."}
{"text":"Literally just got my food 10 minutes ago. A few bites in and I'm already sold. First time customer... I ordered chicken strips, French fries & onion rings for delivery and the food was still crunchy and hot! The fries are awesome! And they deliver late (I ordered after 9 pm.) Delivery guy was nice! Definitely a new customer!"}
{"text":"After having a Luke warm experience with an order I had delivered they did their very best to remedy the situation!  So they are getting 4 stars for customer service!! Thank you for being so professional and understanding!"}
{"text":"Do not go spend stupid money anywhere else, I don't care how fancy you are this place is NUMBER ONE. Friendly and prompt service, HUHE PORTIONS on the fries and they really don't skimp on toppings. This place is a MUST. Seriously. Good. Food."}
{"text":"Top notch hole-in-the-wall burger joint. You get a massive burger at a great price and can make it the way you want. What sets this place apart though, is the service. The staff were attentive and friendly, and it felt like they truly cared about ensuring we were happy with our dining experience. We will certainly return to Johnny Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate there last nite. I had the Philly, which was delicious. GF had fish and fries, also very good. Service was fine. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous when we pulled up and saw this place inside a dive bar in a strip mall. But it had great reviews and we decided to give it a try. The guys that work here are super nice! And we tried a variety of things! The philly cheese fries were awesome! But the hot wings were sub par. Over all it gets a 3 star from me. It would probably be a 4 star for food but the atmosphere is not the most appealing to me."}
{"text":"Wish I would of took a picture. The food was super good. Had the philly cheese steak, my boy had the chicken strips, and a side of onion rings. Very good."}
{"text":"We are addicted to the philly cheese, OMG! Pizza is awesome! Great food, and we are picky eaters!  Not greasy food, and quick delivery service, always very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast prep time :) Will be order again so want to try the pizza fries  And everything else.  Happy"}
{"text":"SOOOOO glad these wonderful people were able to get out of the dump of a bar they were in before. Fantastic food, great staff, they deserve to be happy where they are. The food is awesome."}
{"text":"I really only spend a few minutes at the bar while I wait for take out food but the staff and the patrons are all nice people.   But the food... the burgers specifically... are so good.   As a local I've been to all the gourmet burger spots and the strip and these burgers can compete with any of them. Maybe I like the Johnny Vegas burger because I'm Johnny V as well? Who knows, but it's a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Great local for pub and grub. Good food--especially the fries, which are a specialty of the house--and great variety of sandwiches, burgers, and wings, etc. service is excellent. I've used them for pizza delivery and that, too, was excellent: price, delivery, and the pizza itself. The only thing lacking is ambiance. But who cares?  Check it out.   Follow up. Still a great place for a snack. Beer is cheap; Philly cheese steak and onion rings; wife had a corn dog and fries. All good. Friendly and good service. We live close by, so that makes it all the better.   Best kept secret in this side of town. Great pub food and terrific service. The beer is cold and cheap. Try the Philly cheese steak. Excellent. And fries are fresh an cooked just right."}
{"text":"The fries are to die for! I recommend the chicken bacon ranch fries, and also the chicken tenders."}
{"text":"Soooooo, I finally got to try Johnny Vegas Grill last night.... I got ta looking at all of the pix of food on yelp and I decided enough is enough already.   I had never been inside of Mr. G' s so when I entered I wasn't sure where to go.   The female bartender greeted me and told me the food  was in the far right hand corner.   I ordered a Philly Cheese steak sandwich.  It doesn't come with anything...so I ordered a side of crispy fries for $1.25.   Believe me. I was so tempted to try some of their super cool French fry plates. All different kinds of toppings etc. next time I will  Great sandwich (meat really tender and flavorful). Bread was really soft. And was really big. I saved half for today  Fries were good as well   Came with a side of 1,000 island dressing too  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great portions. Food is good but kinda greasy. Namesake Fries tasted great in small amounts but after a while they make you kinda sick with how heavy and grease they are. Still I would recommend the place, just make sure you share"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Best delivery food I've ever had. We ordered 25 min before closing and all the food was fresh and hot. Delivery person was friendly and laid back. Delicious burgers! Amazing fried mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"When a pizza and a quesadilla love each other very much, they come together and form a culinary delicacy known as a pizza-dilla. This creation is comprised of a large, folded, griddle-cooked tortilla packed with cheese, sauce, and your favorite pizza toppings!  The pizza-dilla is a messy meal, and not a healthy one either. But if you're in a junk food mood or can't decide between contrasting cravings, it's a solid option. The supreme version has peppers, onions, olives, sausage, and pepperoni. The plain pepperoni version is a great classic choice that takes me back to childhood kitchen experiments.   Service was polite, dine-in seating available, takeout orders encouraged to be called in for fastest service. Prices are super-cheap, too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken wings and Johnny original Vegas fries it was soo good and delivery was extremely fast. Not to mention the excellent customer service. When I tipped the driver he thanked me and shook my hand. I wish I could have tipped him more."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. Had the ultimate pizza. Should have been cooked longer. Based on the pictures i saw on yelp, i was already worried that it wouldn't be cooked long enough and sure enough it wasn't. Also had the Vegas fries. They were different in a good way but it was just smothered with too much of the sauce. That's saying something because i always want more sauce on everything. Lastly, we ordered a couple corn dogs. Those were actually the best part of the meal. The batter was slightly sweeter than most and it really made them taste great. $31 spent and the only thing we were truly happy with were the processed corn dogs. We'll definitely be spending our money elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I was desperate for a delivery place that wasn't pizza or Thai food! After a little searching, I found this little gem was near my place of employment.   I was so happy to discover that their veggie patty was a Boca burger and they are VEGAN! They customer service was amazing. They were also willing to make all accommodations so my burger was vegan!!  The delivery service was crazy fast! My order was accurate and the food was delicious! My burger had tons of fresh veggies on it! The fries were seasoned perfectly. They also put tootsie rolls in your bag as a little treat!  I will definitely order from here again when we are craving some delivery and don't want pizza! Also, there is not a delivery charge for this place. The minimum order amount is only 15 bucks, now that's a deal!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!! Great food made fresh n served HOT! It's inside a pub so kinda hard to find but once you go in and order your meal you will not be disappointed! I only went to this place due to a yelp review and 5 Star  rating. I really enjoyed the Philly cheesesteak and will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff! Check it out for yourself and go to the website for Johnny Vegas grill and order!!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com! Fast delivery and amazing food! One of the best burgers I've ever had. Johnny Fries are amazing and so are the onion rings. Sandwiches are very fresh and tasty. To be real I haven't ordered anything I haven't liked. My whole family loves JVG!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based off their food. Late night cravings started to call my name and this location was one of the very few places open super late at night near my area. I ordered take out and had my boyfriend pick it up because their delivery service was down due to their employee calling out sick. That didn't matter too much because we don't live far and I wasn't driving, lol. Anyway, I ordered their regular Philly Cheesesteak and a side of fries. Let me tell you, I enjoyed this sandwich more than I did an actual Philly cheesesteak from Philly that I had last year. The fries were delicious and the sauce that came with the sandwich was amazing. I would say that the sauce is what elevated the meal for me and made me love it. Had I known their sauce would be that good, I would have ordered an entire bottle (if they offered it that way). The sandwich itself was nothing short of tasty; everything was prepared beautifully and the bread was not soggy or anything.  If I could change one thing it would be that this place was a stand alone store/restaurant. It gets a little confusing because it's in a bar but nonetheless it is good food. I can't wait to try other sandwiches and snacks there.   BTW, you should sell the sauce!"}
{"text":"Just leaving Las Vegas to head home and we came across this place on yelp. We were treated amazingly and wanted to leave a review. Josh went out of his way to make my friend feel special on her birthday. The food is great as well!!! Never receive service great enough to write a review on yelp. Thanks josh :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  They are very considerate to allergies. Despite the giant burgers there were no leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place. Is the. Baaaahhm. I ordered delivery twice now. Both times fast, food still hot, food still delicious, and they remembered everything I ordered.  Last time we ordered johnny vegas fries and the Philly cheese steak with marinara. Hooooly....it was so flavorful. This time we got the supreme pizza, the mac and cheese bites and jv fries with added grilled onions. Again. Outstanding. I can't even explain how good this place is. Seriously some of the best food I've ever had, and I've been to places all over the US.   The mac and cheese bites are hot, perfectly crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Even the pasta on the inside is cooked perfectly. The johnny vegas fries have this amazing garlicy mayo that I order an extra side of to put on future sandwiches. Pizza was hot, cheesy, and LOADED with toppings.   My new favorite place for sure."}
{"text":"The people here are the best. Let's start with that. I was stuck waiting at the DMV and really wanted a slice of pizza. I Yelped and saw this place Johnny Vegas wasn't too far. It had some crazy food combinations, like the Philly Fries and the Pizza-dilla. I couldn't pass those up so I ordered both. I called in to place a pickup order, and besides not saying his name, the gentleman was very helpful and polite. Before I arrived, Taryn (I think that's how you spell it) called and told me my food was ready and how to get there, because they were inside of a bar and their sign had blown off.  They don't have a lot of space inside, but it works. It's not in a great neighborhood, and you can't bring your kids in. Sorry.   Taryn was expecting me and greeted me by name.  I paid and we made small talk. She offered different suggestions to other things on the menu. I noticed something wrong on my order but they quickly took care of it. While I waited I ate the pizza-dilla. Kinda greasy, super cheesy and decent. 8/10. It would've been better with something more than just cheese. While I was eating, the delivery driver came in, stayed for a second, and left. On his way out, he smiled and spoke to me.  Ok why is everyone so nice...   Taryn seemed to be training someone (he was also nice, aware a patron was in his establishment; a novel idea these days), and you could tell she took pride in teaching and just being there in general. She was very engaging and has such a great smile! Basically... she was amazing. My new order came out. Before I left we talked a little more. I was just so impressed.   I tried the Philly fries back at the DMV. First thought... Damn this is a small portion. I guess I was used to the massive loads you get from Robertos. Didn't matter, I didn't finish it either way, SMH. 9/10. I think I would like it better if the fries weren't seasoned. It kinda clashes with the great seasoning of the steak. Plain fries I think would be a 10.. I like the ideas they have, and being from the east coast, not too far from Philly, I looooove Philly Cheesesteaks. I would like to try other things on their menu.  But their service was a 100/10. That's not a typo. They're all that good. I don't live on this side but would consider driving over to eat and chill. I might seriously start doing that.  Taryn, thanks for being a highlight in my day!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Relied on the reviews to choose a pizza place and I have an absolutely different opinion on the food. Food took 1 hour to be delivered. One pizza and one order of 5 chicken fingers cost us $38. We ordered and paid for bacon as an extra topping and it was no where to be found on our pizza. The pizza dough was way too soft it fell apart and there was just way too much tomato sauce that it was the only thing you could taste. The fries were cold and not fresh, they tasted over cooked and was sitting out all day. And the chicken fingers were also overcooked. I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"So...just now, I got my delivery. I feel terrible because I'm from Austin but am staying at a friend's house and he probably didn't give me the best address or crossroads. I will say that that folks here not only were kind and helpful but they went out of their way to help a poor out of towner (soon to move here) person get their order here!! So yay! I mean....they went above and beyond what any place would or should. No question.  In terms of food, I can't even believe it was still hot and good by the time I got it! (Due to my own fault, lol) but even the sauce...the SAUCE was hot. Not just warm, but HOT. After me sending the poor delivery person on a goose chase. And the delivery person was so nice and just wonderful. Apologetic even though it was MY own damn fault, lol.   Food that I ordered was AMAZINGLY delicious and I will always remember this place for not only being super cool with trying to get it to me (lol) but also for the great taste! Plus, it's a gigantic amount of food....I got a couple of sides.....they are like entrees. Salad is a whole tub, Fries are a whole tub. You get a ton and their food is super tasty.   Overall, SUPER happy i found this place! I know Austin is the pseudo capital of the food world but seriously, there really are other good places around, people. This is probably one you should try. Especially for delivery. Just. Awesome. Couldn't ask for more. When I move here in a month, I'll be back for sure and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. It was THAT good."}
{"text":"Best burgers I have had!! Cooked to perfection!! The fried mushrooms are to die for!! Cooked perfectly with a crispy outside and juicy inside. Homemade ranch. They earn their stars on Yelp!! Little whole in the wall place but hey..... Aren't the best restraunts usually like that?? They deliver too!! This is my fifth time eating here and I will order again and again!! Yum yum yum...is all I can say!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here ! Super yummy ! Cheesesteak is packed w/ meat !! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"While their fries rock, everything else is sub-par and the service is abhor able!!!  On a regular basis I hear and see these people treat customers like crap. My friends come here, so I do. While I normally avoid ordering from them, on principle, I occasionally cave.  Tonight attempted to order the special they have posted. A \"Taco Burger\". The bartender rang the restaraunt  3x over the course of 20 minutes, apologizing for not being able to take my order, before they finally arrived to take said order. 15 minutes after I placed my order they arrived to tell me they aren't making that anymore, it's only for daytime. No apology for taking so long. No apology for having a special posted they refuse to make...  I will never ever bother with these people again. They apparently don't want my money, so they can't have it. I'll go next door where the food is better anyway. That's my customer service review... as for food... the fries are the only thing worth chewing. Burgers are mediocre at best. Pizza is greasy and chewy, wings, meh...  . I'd give them 4 stars for food just for the fries. 2 for anything else. Negative 500 for customer service."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westgate hotel and ordered from here for delivery. They delivered in under 45 minutes and it was for 3 people. Everything was perfect!   We got a Philly cheesestake sandwich and 2 big burgers with onion rings and fries. Everything tasted great. The delivery driver was nice and speedy. Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I had delivery Three times now.  They are fast and easy to do. I had the Mac bites, Vegas fries, burger and the Philly.   All were the delicious !!!!!!!  Totally worth the trip !!"}
{"text":"This place is good but kind of pricey, However they ALWAYS show up happy with a smile &have great customer service. Don't sleep on the Philly cheese steak it is so goooood!"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place back in January, and gave it 5 stars. Have been ordering regularly since then, and thought I'd share my experience. As a weekly customer, I have never been disappointed. Delivery times that blew me away, different menu items that made me think it couldn't get any better each time, and customer service that you would expect from your favorite establishment. My favorites are the philly cheesesteak and ultimate pizza. Try this place if you get the chance. It's one of the few remaining great eateries in Vegas, and you won't have to spend a ton of money."}
{"text":"Lazy, late and undercooked  I ordered a veggie pizza for delivery. Upon first glace I could tell that the cooks do not care about the dishes they put out. The toppings are lazily piled in the center of the pizza with an after thought of cheese \"layered\" on top. The pizza is cooked at too high a temperature. I could tell because the edges are burnt while the center of the pizza was completely raw. On top of this, it is obvious that whoever prepared the menu does not understand the ingredients they are working with. The toppings on their veggie pizza all release water and when I received my pizza it was wet from the run off of the cooked out water. It is a good this this location is also a bar because you would have to be some level of drunk to find the food remotely palatable."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was amazing! I couldn't have been any more pleased with this place. We love trying new places and we are so happy we tried this one. The johnny fries are to die for! The prices are reasonable and the quality is exceptional. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey, Johnny Vegas fries, you had me at hello!   Seriously, once I laid my hungry eyes upon your layers of bacon, melted cheddar cheese, and drizzled garlic mayo and cilantro herb seasoning, I knew my plans for a healthy diet would not last (at least for that day).     I first had these fries when my coworkers ordered for delivery.  The following week I ventured to get some of them on my own.  It turned out to be a little section within a bar/pub.  It's more of a delivery or take out place for this reason unless you want to sit at the one tiny table in the corner of the pub.  Oddly, there's also a $1 take-out fee.  Since then, I've actually ordered from Johnny Vegas Grill multiple times while at work for all my co-workers.  We've tried so much from their menu and the majority have been a huge hit with the staff here at Desert Springs Hospital.    Some things I'd suggest to try out:  Pizza quesadillas, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers w/ cream cheese filling, Italian philly, delicious fish tacos (spicy), and of course their Johnny Vegas Fries.    They also sell candy like Caramel Apple Pops and Twix here!  Their food is exceptionally good and they truly appreciate their customers.  The last time we ordered from them they threw in a free slice of cheesecake with a personalized 'thank you' message.   It was delicious and now is also on our must order list.   JVG has become our #1 go to spot for late night food delivery and we'll be ordering from them time and time again.    Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 33/100"}
{"text":"We received a menu from this place at work and decided to order from here. The reviews looked pretty good so we figured why not?   When we placed the order we were told it would be about 35 minutes. After about 50 minutes we called to check in the status and the person told us the guy should have already have been here and that he hoped the guy wasn't in an accident. He said he would call right back. Ten minutes went by and we called again and he said he was shocked the guy still hadn't arrived. He offered me $10 off my next order and said he couldn't do anything on this order.   The delivery guy finally showed up and blamed the guy at the store for misquoting the delivery time.   We order finger with buffalo sauce. The fingers were ok but the buffalo sauce was awful. It was like butter and tabasco mixed together.   We also ordered BBQ chicken fries too. The BBQ sauce was not very good and the chicken was super bland.   Another person order the chicken ranch fries and he said it was pretty good and liked it.   Honestly, not impressed here at all and won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Love the food here, what ruined it was the fact that they charged me a delivery fee when it says free within a 3 mile radius and I'm within that, first couple times I ordered from here they didnt charge delivery fee then all of a sudden they do makes no sense"}
{"text":"I ordered the Johnny burger. I've always made my hamburger patties with bell pepper and onion inside so I decided to give theirs a try. It was delicious ! The fries were also very good. Fresh with just the right amount of crisp. I also ordered a Cesar salad, it was a pretty good size but it was nothing spectacular.   I was so satisfied with the burger I ordered from them a second time.   The second time the burger was just as good as the first. This time I added an order of hot wings. It was overly breaded for my taste so not enough chicken for me.   Over all I will be ordering from here again but will probably stick the burger and fries ! I also tried their coleslaw on the side and it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Update:  Five Stars.  I'm really struggling to remember why I ever gave them four instead of five.  Nonetheless -- since my original reviews, I've ordered from JVG (as I like to abbreviate them) four or five times.  We've tried a selection of their specialty fries and sandwiches and have NEVER been disappointed.  Tonight I ordered their March Madness special (as listed on their Facebook page) and was so happy.  We got a philly cheesesteak sandwich, the chicken ranch fries, fried mushrooms, and a 2L of diet coke.  It was more than enough to feed the two of us with some leftovers to spare.    We've only ever done delivery, largely because it's consistent and delicious.  My husband feels like he has a \"relationship\" with the driver at this point, which is a sign of a good local business.  The food is great - we've tried a pretty broad selection and have never had complaints.  It always comes hot and fresh, and reheats pretty well (see my below hash suggestion).  We will certainly continue to order from the JVG.  :)"}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed. I ordered the loaded fries, Mac and cheese  bites, and the Philly cheese steak. Everything was excellent and the delivery was super fast. Good job Johnny!!"}
{"text":"Whilst looking up \"Best Chicken Salad\" I stumbled across Johnny Vegas Grill. I told my buddy in food eating shenanigans, Malinda, about this place as we are always on the hunt to taste and judge supposedly the \"best\". I didn't care for the idea of a chicken salad, but I saw reviews on the burgers and it became top priority on my food eating agenda.  We drove out of our way to Desert Inn and Sandhill, which was my old neighborhood growing up. George E. Harris Elementary School! That brought back so many memories, I was looking forward to a Vegas style treat. I'm all about Old Vegas! She had visited the day before based on the reviews and really couldn't wait.  She came back to me and said the staff was amazing and the place was \"the size of a stamp\". I said, \"It couldn't be that small, it had a pool table\".  When entering, it reminded me of a Vegas bar from the 80'S = perfect! The \"grill\" is in the back right corner upon entering; you're basically ordering at a door. I'm not pretentious and I don't expect the Ritz-Carlton. In fact, I prefer more down-home and less fancy-schmancy. The venue was NOT the size of a stamp, it was in a bar with plenty of room for a mechanical bull if they wanted one in there. We came up to the door, and were greeted with a smile - which is always a great way to start a meal.  Ordering was easy, we were given all the options for toppings on our burger. I asked for some coleslaw on the side so I can put it on my burger, I highly recommend that!!!  We chose to dine in, you do have to get your drinks at the bar even if it's a soda. I didn't mind that, I'll leave a review for the bar itself. We chose to sit at a booth seat, low and behold they didn't call for us to come and get our food, they brought it out.   Now that's what I'm talking about, old Vegas service!  Let me get into this food situation:  The wait was average, not too long, and long enough for me to order my drink which means it was not a heat lamp Burger. The burger was THE BOMB = juicy, full of flavor = exactly the way I wanted it. It had all the fixin's, however I forgot to ask for onions. I politely requested them, they were brought to me promptly. Nice! The fries were Finger Licking Good = nuff said. My friend ordered the chili fries, it was a tidy tastefull mess = how chili fries should be.  I enjoyed every minute and every bite of my meal, which is exactly why I went clear out of my way driving from Henderson just for this burger.  I decided on my way out, I definitely need a Johnny Vegas hat. I'm an avid hat collector, so I have to figure out how I'm going to get a hat.  Some might complain smoking is allowed in the bar, which would bother them while they're eating their food, however I'm not a douchebag - it's an old Vegas bar and exactly what I expected.  I would definitely eat here again, worth the drive.  REASONS TO VISIT JOHNNY VEGAS GRILL: 1. Parking Lot 2. Reasonable Prices 3. Friendly Service 4. Great Food, especially the burger.  5. Take-Out 6. Dine-In 7. Delivery"}
{"text":"Dive bar for sure but the food was outstanding. The chef makes everything to order so don't be skeptical and it's location. It is the hood but come during lunch or have it delivered if you are within 5 miles. Philly cheesesteak and Vegas fries. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this is a review is because I ordered from eat24. I was a little hesitant because the last place I ordered from wasn't all that great (it was a bbq restaurant). However, Johnny Vegas Grill definitely redeemed online ordering for me! Not only was the timing amazing - my food arrived nice & hot - and delicious!   I ordered the fried mushrooms and philly fries..  I intended to share the fried mushrooms, but that certainly did not happen. I am thankful for fresh mushrooms and tasty breading. Definitely not the overly frozen stuff that I'm used to.   The philly fries were great - lots of meat and the flavor was delicious!  To top it all off - the gentleman who delivered my meal had excellent customer service and was very thankful when I handed him a tip. (you don't see that very often anymore).   Overall, great experience! I will be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to take a plunge and try something new and different, and this place did NOT disappoint us!! While I wasn't expecting a \"bar room\" atmosphere (which did surprise me), the seating is set up in such a way that you almost forget about the bar on the other side of the room! We started out with the fried ravioli which were delicious (and I ate most of them, LOL!). The cook might want to consider adding a sprinkling of parmesan cheese before sending them out to the table, but they were great otherwise.  My husband had the chicken sandwich, which he thoroughly enjoyed... And I had the two ton pizza quesadilla.  (A PIZZA quesadilla? WTF?).  I had my doubts about the concept - but once I got my first bite, OHHHHHH BOY was I hooked!! Friendly service, prompt check in to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and an overall terrific experience! 10/10 will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I order from here frequently.  Their food is pretty good, but expect to wait over an hour to get your order.   I lived in Philly and a cheesesteak isn't a difficult item to make but they seem to muck it up.   I'll keep ordering because it's convenient."}
{"text":"Great Food, Rick is the best delivery person, The FASTEST Delivery I have ever seen !!  Thank you ! You make my day with every bite of this food Thomas"}
{"text":"I drove by this place at least 4 times before FINALLY realizing that it's a kitchen inside of Mr. G's.  Don't waste gas by making the same mistake I did!   Honestly, I love greasy heart attack food.  Johnny Vegas Grill is just the place for that.  My bestie and I were both just in the mood to stuff our faces and have no regrets!  This place was pretty close to work so we decided to check it out.  We ended up getting SO much food.  We split a burger and got a bunch of apps, including: cheese curds, olive poppers, mozzarella sticks, and boneless wings.    For the most part, the food was great.  Some of it could have used a little more flavor, but overall I was pleased.    The only reason they lost a star was for service.  My friend and I were intrigued by the pizza quesadilla and we ended never getting to try it.  They completely forgot it was on our ticket and we never got it.  It ended up being on our check... which we of course got it taken off.  Also, I'm not sure if they solved this problem since we were last there, but their prices on the menu didn't match the prices in their computers that they actually charge.  The prices were higher in the computer by anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar.  I know a lot of these are service no-nos, but my reviews are heavily reliant on the food and the food didn't disappoint.  I'll probably be back one day when I'm having my next heart attack food craving."}
{"text":"Ok, guys...what happened Super Bowl Night...I ordered my usual burger, WELL DONE, lots of toppings and mozzarella sticks with ranch.  Everything looked ok until I took a bite of the burger...To me, well done does not mean almost raw...it means well done....no pink in sight..well, this time...I couldn't even eat it it was so under cooked.  The dog and the cats loved it...me...not so much....sadly, first time in a long time of eating here, I was truly disappointed.  I will try ordering again in the future, but the anticipation won't be for how good it's going to be, for me now, it's going to be, will I actually get to eat it or will the animals get a treat.  Have to say the mozzarella sticks were good as was the ranch dressing and I do love the little \"dessert\" of tootsie rolls...nice touch."}
{"text":"Made an account just to post my experience with \"Johnny Vegas Grill\" Unfortunately I don't have much to say about the quality of the food because I never got to try it. I had noticed my order for delivery was running a bit late so I called to see if they had forgotten about it or what have you, turns out they delivered my order of a pizza and the specialty fries to my neighbor. They also didn't care to send over a new order or refund my original order at all(paid online with a card). So I'm out 31 bucks.  The reviews concerning the food seem to be good, just beware of their customer service.    Update: About an hour after posting this review I got a response on here as well as a voicemail from JVG, they seem to now care about helping me with this issue after I've posted it on yelp. Unfortunately when I initially called they didn't care as much. To be honest I don't care if grub hub or JVG made the error, The point of this review is to highlight the customer service of this establishment. The issue is I got zero help when I called JVG about this when it initially happened before I posted about it on yelp. An obvious attempt to save face. I shouldn't have to make a yelp account/post for a restaurant to do the right thing."}
{"text":"Takeout was Great ! The food hit the spot delivery was on time I do recommend ordering  Customer service was also very good"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was tying to get some food delivered at my house in the morning and most places didn't open until 10am. I decided to see if this restaurant delivered and was open around 8. And they were. I ordered the cheese pizza and the chicken ranch fries and they were AMAZING. My fries were a good portion and coming from a person that eats like a cow that is a compliment. Honestly I'm not even a fan of chicken but their chicken fries were heavenly. The pizza was great my 4 year old had 3 slices.  Now let me speak about the service, the guy who delivered it was so freaking nice. I kinda had him waiting outside for a little bit because I couldn't get our dog to calm down. When I opened the door he was so nice and patient.  I'll definitely order more from this place, mmmmm maybe for lunch?..."}
{"text":"We ordered Johnny Vegas grill for the first time tonight... And my family was very pleased. We got a large carnivores delight pizza with pineapples, a crispy chicken salad regular style and a burger special. Pizza has great crust, toppings were good. Will definitely be back.  My only drawback is I feel the salad could I had a little more chicken."}
{"text":"Kept me alive while I lived on that side of town. Great food, fantastic super fast delivery."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite pizza place ordered pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and pizza fries.  Pizza crust seemed premade hard with no flavor sauce had little flavor very little pepperoni.  Pizza fries were o.k.  Wouldn't order pizza."}
{"text":"I bought dinner here for the family and it ended up being a little more than I expected to pay. Upon noticing my aversion to the price the guy behind the counter said, \"you will not be disappointed.\" How true that is. I was most certainly not disappointed. This bomb-ass, exquisite, gourmet philly cheese and stuffed mushrooms was worth every penny. I can already feel the addiction forming. A+ definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had our food delivered, it was delivered much sooner than expected. We had the Italian sub, fried mushrooms, philly style fries, and the ultimate pizza. Everything was delicious, the pizza was not skimpy on toppings at all, the sub was perfect and much bigger than expected, I'm really picky with fried mushrooms and am typically disappointed at most restaurants but these were the best I have ever had. Will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great prices. My kids really enjoy the pizza quesadillas! Where else am I going to find those."}
{"text":"Customer service is awesome! Both server and waitress were very friendly and politethe food was delicious. the wife and i had the mr.g's burger and the philly cheese steak. Burger was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the philly cheese steak meat was tender and juicy. Definitely a place we will enjoy visiting on our next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for the best tasting burger in Vegas, I have been in shock at how much better the food tastes than all my neighborhood eateries, I recommend the JVB its amazing and they aren't afraid to cook it medium rare for me!!  Fingers are crispy, large, and delish, I recommend the garlic parmesan.  Wings are the old fashioned breaded wing dings that you cant find anymore  I am a professional Chef here in Vegas for over 20 years and this is a DIAMOND   order up without fear"}
{"text":"I've never been to their actual physical location, having only relied on their rather fantastic delivery service for partaking in their food.  They deliver well, quickly, and tend to follow any special requests with a high accuracy. Plus, with a $15 minimum, the delivery itself is actually free. I am always impressed with how they handle orders that often need to be split up amongst my multiple coworkers in different containers with the food arriving as requested and in perfect condition. I will say, however, that they are a bit stingy with their condiments, as in even if you order a ton of food you may only get four packets of ketchup.  The food is pretty typical of it's kind, greasy and delicious. Their Vegas Fries in particular are the favorite of my workplace, and I personally love their Pizza Quesadillas - though I would like them even more if they came with marinara or something to dip it in. If you are in their delivery range and want some great food for a decent price, this is a great place to go to. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very horrible quality in food I would not recommend them to anyone I don't see how there in business and it smells like cigaret smoke"}
{"text":"I was on the fence about ordering from here.. But I saw reviews on here & eat24 and decided to risk it. Delivery is free with a $15 minimum which is nice because you can get a lot for $15. I was very happy that it arrived way before the 44 min estimated waiting time, because it was only about 15-25 minutes. The food came and the driver was nice. I checked my food and saw that I got plain chicken fingers when I ordered Hot, but I just threw red hot on it so no big deal. That's why I took off a star. The fries are delicious with garlic. Super good. The mac n cheese bites were also pretty good! I saw others didn't like them but it was cheesy and good. Overall great! Will probably order from again."}
{"text":"I'm from the northeast so I know a good Philly Cheese Steak when I eat one! WOW this food is so good! I ordered two Philly cheese steaks with Johnny Vegas Fries and I am thoroughly satisfied! The Bacon and Sauce on the fries are amazingly good! This place is my favorite place to order from in all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from them.  Got delivery from a Super nice guy, Rich!  Food was almost 30 min EARLY!  HOT HOT HOT......  & we tried the Johnny vegas fries.  If you have never tried these-TO DIE FOR A MUST HAVE!!  WOW!  I had their philly sandwich and it is going to last me about 3 meals!  Chicken salad with ranch dressing was huge!  Johnny Vegas Burger perfect just like was ordered!  Very juicy!!  Onion rings were perfect.  No complaints here.  We are definitely going to be ordering from Johnny Vegas again!!!!"}
{"text":"We came across this place by accident, but I'm glad we did, we tried the Mr. G's burger, and it was delicious, very juicy and full of flavor in every bite, definitely will return again."}
{"text":"The one thing I will miss about the Eastside is Johnny Vegas Grill. The food is always hot, fresh, and damn near perfect. They've got some of the juiciest burgers I've ever had, and at a price I can afford. Their delivery estimate is usually 45 to 60 minutes, but the only time I've had them take more than half an hour is when I ordered dinner on game night, and even then it didn't even take the whole hour.  Their staff is absolutely stellar. My cat likes to try to dash out the door, so I leave a note to that effect. Every single time I've had delivery through JVB, the delivery guy was braced to catch the cat if he made it out before I shut the door (one even helped me catch him when the cat slipped past us both).  The year I spent on the Eastside was peppered with break-ins, apartment troubles, getting towed from my own parking spot, and even a stalking incident. The only reason I'm sorry to be leaving this hell-hole is that I won't be in delivery range for this place anymore.  Seriously, these guys rock and you are missing out on the only good thing about this part of town if you never try their food."}
{"text":"Reluctant to go in. It's kinda divey. Glad I did though cause the food was delicious and the service quick. Had the Johnny Vegas fries OMG so good. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak which was so big and stuffed full with cheese steak and peppers. He couldn't finish it. Lunch tomorrow.  Don't be put off by the outside. Try it!"}
{"text":"After I had some complications with my delivery order the  staff here made sure it was fixed which displayed going above and behind and that's good service I salute Johnny for being on top of his game"}
{"text":"WOW!! I placed an order and got 2 phone calls to confirm a faulty delivery address. My order arrived with food still hot. The driver was professional and understanding. He didn't continue on about the excessive mileage to deliver my order promptly. I'm extremely impressed with the integrity AND the quality of the food I received. I would highly recommend this business for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying Johnny Vegas was not a great experience But they displayed outstanding customer service and wanted make sure we were happy. with our second order the cheese pizza was good with a good amount of cheese. we also tried the Johnny Vegas fries and those were amazing. the garlic mayo was such a great addition. I look forward to trying more items on theor menu."}
{"text":"5STAR on a 1st time visit. You are DA BIZNIZZ, omg I have found my burger joint. It's always the little divey places that have the killer eats.  I've been on the burger search for almost 4yrs, not really big on the major food chain burgers, and I stay away from the strip b/c I'm not a tourist AND I would like to do more than just buy 1 BURGER.  ORDERED pick up via EAT24 and used my weekend coupon save $2. Benefit from the coupon, that's when you add the stars like bacon, sauce, etc, etc   ORDER WAS READY 20mins, also the restaurant calls to confirm your online order and calls again when your order is ready.  I ordered Mr. G's Burger w/ onion rings: cooked med well w/ lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, cheese and thousand island dressing. I added bacon to mines, totally worth it.(Bacon is extra) Nice hand pressed patty, cooked on a grill top, super juicey. They know how to make a burger at this place, not over cooked, burger falls apart, very little pink just how I like.  Very reminiscent of my grandfather's homemade burgers, a very simple recipe with fresh ingredients and seasoned well. I'm all about fresh ingredients, it makes the food that much better.  JVG is known for their FRIES: the original, philly fries, veggie fries, chicken ranch fries, bbq chicken fries and pizza fries...which means I will be making more visits, I have to try the fries. But this is just my opinion, go check them out yourself"}
{"text":"So many things to offer on the menu it's really hard to make a decision.   Ordered online for delivery the first time and I was mind blown with the concept of a pizza in a quesadilla and surprised with how good the 2 tons quesadilla was.   Stopped in again today to try the Johnny Vegas philly fries and was very impressed.  Going in they are very welcoming and friendly and food is great.   Right down the street from my work so I found my new go to when it comes to lunch.   Thanks again Johnny Vegas!"}
{"text":"Got my food within 30 mins. Driver Ricky was efficient and friendly. Food was great as well; nice portions. Johnny Vegas Grill is my go to for Philly Cheese Steaks"}
{"text":"They are rated fairly high, but pizza is not their forte...Angelina's is way better! The crust was meh, and extra cheese did not make me feel cheesy.  It was a delivery order, and it was delivered fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Prior to my 1st review it seems they did a 180 I ordered the chicken tenders and the fish both were delicious and hot when I got them the only complaint I have is my fries had vinegar  spilled on them I did not order. But over all I'm pleased and glad to give this establishment one more chance 3 years later!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place  EXCELLENT food and definitely worth the price. Their pizzas are so good and heavy on the toppings. Taste so authentic. And their philly cheese steak fries are BOMB!! Oh and mac n cheese bites as well!! Basically EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Really good \"you can't put it down\" burger because it's so juicy the bun kinda falls apart! That's a good thing in my book! Friendly service. If you are a devote non smoker you won't be happy as smoking is allowed. But I'll be back for the burger!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, onion rings and ranch sauce. Quick delivery. Really like the seasoning on the pizza."}
{"text":"Second time I ordered from here!! They are delicious!! The customer service is great!!!! You guys must try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Well we tried Johnny Vegas Grill again it's been over a year since we've ordered from them and we just ordered they came and hour late and ice cold and nothing was right. Again. this place cooks the food the way they want not the way you want it.  this is the second time and this will be our last."}
{"text":"This is a great place! I have ordered Philly cheese steaks, burgers, mozzarella sticks, and everything in between. The food always comes fresh, well made and full of flavor. I highly recommend Johnny Vegas to anyone."}
{"text":"Rick dropped my food off and i must say they have quick delievery. Ordered the veggie fries and crispy chicken salad with side of fried mushrooms and iam a believer for sure. Gonna order a burger and pizza on the next order!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"The delivery was on time, the food was hot and delicious.  Oh and the Philly Fries were AMAZING!    I highly recommend this place.  At least based on what I ordered.  The Quesadilla was really good but the star of the show was definitely the Philly Fries.  Great cuts of steak, and a great mix of peppers, onions, and cheese."}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Ordered 2 all meat pizzas and 1 pepperoni.  All 3 came quick and were hot when they were delivered.  Driver was friendly and offered packets of cheese and hot peppers.  Each pizza had plenty of toppings and cheese and each were cooked through nicely. I would say the only negative and reason it didn't get the fifth star is for the extra crust around the outside of the pizzas.  The main part of the crust was thin and cooked just right but the full 1 inch of hard crust around the outside would have been better served with at least some sauce and cheese.  I realize you don't want too much on the outside because you wouldn't be able to handle a piece but this was just a little too much wasted.  I'm probably nit-picking here.   I would definitely order pizza from Johnny's again."}
{"text":"Great customer service. They made an error on my pizza order so they re-made a new pizza the way I wanted it. The wife's owner didn't charge me for the pizza plus they gave me a slice of cheese cake. Wings were great! This was my first time at this business and I will be back. I ended up at this location after trying 3 other pizza places around my residents and reviewing Yelp. This one is a winner. They have free delivery if you live within 5 miles. It was actually nice to get great customer service in Vegas for a change. They even followed up and called me to see how my dinner went."}
{"text":"We stopped by here because it was on the way home from visiting a friend and we had a coupon for it in our Entertainment book. Overall we thought the food was pretty good.  Just so you know, this place is actually in a bar card Mr. G's and it is leased out of it like a lot of pizza places do, so don't bring the kids or expect the traditional restaurant experience. It's either eat at the bar or take it to go.  The staff was friendly and the lady at the counter helped us order. She said the most popular things are the Johnny fries, Philly Cheesesteak and the pizza quesadillas, so that's what we got.  The Philly was a little disappointing, only in that there was nothing really special about it. I've had better and had worse, and it was about as middle of the road and plain as a Philly can get. Considering it doesn't even come with fries I would not order it again or recommend it.  The Johnny fries are fries topped with bacon and their garlic mayo. They were delicious, but the amount of fries they came with seemed a little light of a serving. I mentioned this on the way out and the staff said we can ask for extra fries for a small upcharge, which we would do if we ever ordered this again.  The best think was the pizza quesadilla. I cant remember the name of the specific one we ordered but it was the one with pepperoni and sausage. I really enjoyed this and would come back for it. The Quesadilla was cooked nice and crispy on the outside and was stuffed with cheese and meat. It tasted great and the serving size was decent for the price.  Also the bar itself had some decent priced beer specials, so have a beer while you wait and another while you eat. If your in the area and feel like some good bar food, I would check this place out."}
{"text":"Might be me, I don't want to say racist but I stood there and no one  attended to me. The person that worked for them pointed me in that direction but Everyone that was there saw me and not one word as I stood there.  Even the man who pointed it out to me didn't bring their attention to me, I decided to leave and take my business elsewhere. It's a shame food looked delicious. Could have been a new stop for me as I live down the street. I here rum runners is a good place to eat"}
{"text":"The fries are really good. Quick service weather it's called in or just picking up. Very nice staff as well. I would highly recommend the chicken ranch fries."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a good 4-5 times now, including tonight. I guess I'm -slightly- addicted. I even went in to Mr. G's bar to eat in - That wasn't really my scene, but it was a relaxed atmosphere. Tables and things were clean.  Food is still amazeballs."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!!!!  Ordered a cheese with pepperoni, sausage, olives and mushrooms. Also got the fried mushrooms as a appetizer. We really enjoyed the food and they delivered it pretty quickly considering we are almost 3 miles away."}
{"text":"The food is decently priced and has good flavor. Customer service was great and pleasant. Food was a bit greasy but are your really trying to order healthy then go to tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here everyone is super friendly and courteous. My food was hot and delicious large portions as well. I will def order from here again. I ordered a house salad, Philly with fries and an Italian Philly all delicious! Quick service and delivery."}
{"text":"Johnny Vegas fries are the bomb like a party in your mouth fries with cheese bacon and this yummy yummy yummy sauce I call it secret sauce telling you gotta try them  yummy yummy stuff ."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food, huge thank you to the chef and driver for being so understanding"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I was very satisfied with the service. Quick delivery service. The delivery drivers are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Vegas! The food is delicious! I've always ordered, for deliver or to go. This particular visit was delivery everything tasted great and was delivered with a smile. We ordered the Mr G's burger, so messy and good! An order of wing's that were phenomenal! And fried zucchini that was to die for!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews about this place I knew I had to try it. Yes it is located in the deep dark Mr. Gs pub but the woman who greeted me was very friendly and recommended the Johnny Vegas fries and Philly cheesesteak. I was not disappointed. This is definitely a go to place after a late night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Try the special fries! I had the smothered fries with bacon cheese, chicken, tomato, and mush room.   The cook added nice Italian spicing to the dish to male them really delicious.  Mum had the BLT.  Tomatoes were actually fresh, and the lettuce was crisp.  Our server, Brian, was very nice, didn't  hover. After the meal, he offered mum the delivery menu because she lives near by.  I would give 5 starts, but the place is smoky and dark.  BUT,  it's a bar and grill.  So. ..."}
{"text":"Great food! Their delivery is fast & friendly I've never been to the location I always order to deliver"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointing. It was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. The veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken fries and a DIY burger delivery. The fries were absolutely amazing, there was so much chicken and cheese layered on top that I initially doubted whether there were any fries in it at all (the fries were good too). The burger was very fresh and wonderful too, and exactly as I had ordered it."}
{"text":"Decent hole in the wall. It's inside of a Smokey bar, so get it to go you're not use to a local Nevada bar. Doesn't look like it from the outside, but staff is friendly. Had the philly cheese steak, it's not traditional but the steak is chunky and tasty. Upgraded to the JVG fries. A bit heavy for a road trip but still good."}
{"text":"Tried them for my first time yesterday and had the Philly cheesesteak & oh my! It was delicious, also upgraded the frys with the bacon & stuff. And that was super yummy too! I'll be back for more! The lady who helped us was so sweet, and had great customer service!"}
{"text":"Got take out for three and all three of us loved our food. My step-dad picked up the food and bragged on the service. This is significant because he is notoriously hard to impress. I had the Philly cheese steak and it was delicious. Went on Yelp to find good takeout other than pizza and Chinese. Found this place with their great ratings and decided to try it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this via GrubHub. Not expecting much, I was very surpriced how flavor-rich and non \"cheap dive\" tasting the food was. The italian sausage sandwhich was good, packed with seasoned peppers and onions and cheese. The overall impression it left on me was positive, and I would come back for cheap eats. As for the rest of bar that this place resides in, skip it. The kitchen got an A+ and the bar failed miserably."}
{"text":"I ordered the philly fries, and I must say, ther fries are some of the best in Vegas!!! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Ordered a Mr G's burger and onion rings for delivery. Added jalapenos and bacon to the burger....dude....BOMB. Sooo good! Im stuffed! The fries and onion rings were delicious too. Will definitely be trying more in the future. Also, delivery took no time at all. Food was still nice and hot as well."}
{"text":"There people skills on the phone are very good I feel respected and never rushed in anyway while ordering and I got my pizza in a timely manner even though I called first thing in the morning and when I got my pizza the quality of it was excellent I will order again and again"}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak no green pepper & pepperoni quesadilla was super good and they were nice! Located in the bar so we can shoot pool and eat"}
{"text":"I saw the two reviews with 5 stars and figured this place was either a well kept secret or it sucked and these were friends of the owner posting.   Well it DOESN'T suck,  what a great place for basic bar food,  there are times you just need a good basic burger,  let me tell you,  skip the $20 burger places on the strip,  I swear this place could teach most of them how to make a burger.    While it is a shame to let a secret out,  this one is worth sharing."}
{"text":"Great food, great price overall, if you don't like this grill, perhaps you do not like what they have to offer? Pizzas are super! Keep using quality ingredients and keep up the super customer service! 5STAR, BEST around! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and chicken fingers, and both were terrible. $5 Little Ceasars pizza or frozen pizza would have been better."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews for this place a while back and decided I was going to try it - but I forgot until a few days ago when a coworker brought it up. I ordered delivery, and had my food within 30 minutes.  The mac n cheese bites were incredible, as were the fries. I ordered a custom burger which was made correctly and was also pretty incredible - all in all it was a good experience and I'll definitely order again since they deliver to my office."}
{"text":"Portions were very good. Fried pickles were absolutely amazing!! Chicken fingers and philly cheese steak bomb!!!! Will definitely keep ordering here! You have to try the fried macaroni and cheese bites!!! My son loved them!"}
{"text":"I'm editing my review: Pros: Great greasy guilty pleasure food! -JVG -Fries (Regular fries and the JVG fries are amazing) -Open late and Delivery Awesome customer service! My call dropped while Ordering and I got the call back.   Cons: (but still doesn't take away from my rating) I was just informed that outside of 3mi radius, fee for delivery is $3. So, it means that you're better off peer pressuring a buddy to order with you, to be cost effective. Wish there were more locations. But honestly, I probably won't care when the craving comes for some JVG fries."}
{"text":"This place was good for delivery the only thing I didn't like was when we got the food the bread was soggy at the bottom. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger and I got the Italian sub."}
{"text":"Decided to try delivery from here after reading some reviews. First issue with delivery was a $20 minimum, with most items priced $7-8 range. So I got a burger, a corn dog, and chicken wings....way more food than needed.   The burger I ate first. While tasting good, it was a mess to eat, perhaps toasting the bun would help it hold up better. The corndogs were just ok, and the wings were the same. Nothing seemed all that great, and there are better options for any one of those 3 entrees at other places.   Doubt I'll order again unless I actually stop in."}
{"text":"Place is very good. Manager is very helpful and polite to take care of a situation really quick. So  all I say is whoever takes your order or if you order it online I suggest to call back and make sure you have the order repeated to you other than that place is worth price and the food"}
{"text":"Note: Delivery only order  Great food! Fast delivery too...much faster than the app showed.  We loved the pizza and the wings were huge and tasted great!  Nice that the restaurant called back and suggested putting sauces on the side to keep them from getting soggy. Good call :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. The restaurant is kind of hard to find because it is located right inside of a pub but it is well worth the find. The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly. Would definitely recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Had the 12 inch pizza last night and am very impressed with it. Had loads of cheese and meat (pepperoni and sausage), though a little light on sauce for my tastes.  The other menu items looked just as tasty, will have to experiment a little. Don't think, for me at least, that I can generally meet their minimum delivery order of $15, but I generally like to go places.  Which brings me to going to this place... I was so happy to get the pizza and leave. It's a dimly lot bar, with gambling of course, which allows people to smoke in there. The smoke seemed very thick and stale to me, which was very unpleasant. Started getting sick and not feeling so well during the wait.  With that aside, food is great!"}
{"text":"Super fast deliver and amazing food! Our new favorite place!"}
