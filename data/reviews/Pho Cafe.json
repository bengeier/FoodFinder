{"text":"Some of the best Thai food on campus, more flavorful than Bangkok Thai and comparable prices and portion sizes. Very nice customer service, super friendly people, very accommodating."}
{"text":"Pho was flavorful. Did not come with basil/thai basil for some reason, which seemed odd.  Have not gone back for that reason.  i wonder: is this place BYOB (bring your own basil)?"}
{"text":"Really, really good Thai Restaurant. Delicious, well portioned, fresh meals. Reasonable prices. Clean facility. Friendly staff. 10/10 would go again. Try the Fried Rice and the Pho."}
{"text":"It may not look like it from the outside, with its overly-lit and plain inside. But it's the best far-east food on campus! The time it takes them to prepare the food is slower but it's well worth the wait. You can taste the difference in quality here. I won't forget to mention the kindness of the workers here and it's cheap too! I encourage everyone to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I never ever left a review before on restaurants in my life.
However, I strongly felt I had to leave a review after ordering from here three times(I ate at the restaurant also).
I ask them for extra cilantro and bean sprouts every time I order from here and they always give me cilantro and bean sprouts on separate little bags nicely.
I also like to eat fried rice very spicy and their way of making food spicy is on another level. Very deliciously spicy.
Also, the amount of food they serve is not only big but also rich in content. No one will feel they are being stingy on ingredients."}
{"text":"Wow! This place nailed it! 

It's kind of a hole in the wall place... We actually walked right by the first time. 

We had the Pho, the Pad Thai and Red Curry. 

All were amazing! Best we have all had in town so far. The owner even brought out our food and the daughter took our order. I asked for fresh cilantro and the owner brought it out!!!! Great service and amazing food. We will be back and recommend it to our friends. What a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Tried every single noodle pad style and it was amazing!
Great Food.. going there once a day!
Flavored perfect! and served quickly!.
Definitely going back there!"}
{"text":"I didn't like it all all. Too oily... and rice was way too dry. Sorry. But the environment is better than the other tai pho place in green street. But flavor is way worse"}
{"text":"Pretty average Viet/Thai place on campus. The pho broth is nice and refreshing, which is nice compared to other places since theirs are a bit too heavy. However, there is an aftertaste to it I don't really like so much. Other foods like fried rice and noodle dishes are meh. Average, not what you would call mind blowing. Overall, a convenient place to grab food if you're close to campus for OK Asian food."}
{"text":"The two things I tried from the Thai part of their menu were very good, much better than the decidedly mediocre Bangkok Thai down the street, and at least as good as any other order-at-the-counter Thai restaurant in CU.  The portions were quite generous.  I will definitely add this place to my regular Green Street lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I used to like this restaurant but not anymore because their pho became bland and they removed my favorite part of the menu -- the appetizers. I really miss their fried tofu."}
{"text":"Super super super nice owner, place is really clean and the best part FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!! Their fried rice is my favorite, not oily or salty at all, and their pad Kee Mao is great too!!!"}
{"text":"The beef pho here is delicious! I would venture to say the best on campus. The staff is really nice and the restaurant is very clean. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I walked in shortly after 11am and the restaurant already had a steady stream of people trickling in.   I ordered the beef pho and egg rolls.  Total came to just over $12.    After about five minutes, my soup was ready for me!   It came with the traditional garnishes of bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno (but the mint/thai basil was missing...but i don't use that anyway). At first taste, the broth was solid.   The noodles were clumped up into a ball and despite other reviews, their wasn't a lot of meat in it.  A few meatball halves and the flank steak.  After a few squirts of hoisin and sriracha, i decided that this was just an ok Pho.  Nothing spectacular.... The broth didn't seem like it simmered overnight....there was something a little \"instant\" to it.    The egg rollls were crispy but really lacking any seasoning. I don't think I would order them again.   The pho was just ok... I'd rank it probably second best in the land.   I would prefer to walk down the street and eat At Pho 911 anyday.  The place was busy and it seemed everyone was either ordering the pho or a thai curry.   Welcome to town, Pho Cafe!"}
{"text":"Very good Seafood Pho, I added some chili flakes to kick up the spice and it did not disappoint.  Next time I fully intend to try the pad Thai spicy!

Very much worth the trip to green st."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Pad Ped is one of the most delicious things in Champaign-Urbana!"}
{"text":"My go to meal is their pork fried rice. The pork is so juicy and they actually give a great amount for their price; it is enough for me to last two meals so I usually come here during lunch. They also have the combination fried rice where you are able to get all the meats, which is unique because there is not another restaurant I know of that does this.
I must say I go here at least once a week. :)"}
{"text":"I'm just gunna say it: their pho sucks. Which is sad considering that it's called PHO CAFE. 

For $9 a bowl, I should not be getting a sad bowl with pale broth, semi hard noodles, and sad looking pieces of meat. I should also not get *only* bean sprouts and a miniscule wedge of lime for it. Where is the basil? Where is the culantro (different from cilantro)? Why is there shallot oil in my pho???? 

I had a headache and it was raining, so like many college students nursing a headache I decided to get pho. The guy taking my order was nice though, and their way of taking and bringing out orders is efficient. But their pho seriously needs some work. Personal space is also not a thing here, since there are a lot of long tables and it can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush. 

I've learned my lesson. Next time I come here, it will only be for my Thai food cravings."}
{"text":"Just do not eat Pho here.. not anywhere near authentic. There is no vegetable, soup is oversweet..."}
{"text":"The broth and noodles are good.

The only missing is the choice of to include Beef tripe and tendon; along with mint leaves and selancho.

I will go back again for that broth."}
{"text":"They don't state this on the menu nor do they tell you unless you ask: they charge $1 for any meat besides shrimp (which is $1.75 according to the menu). 

The interior is nice, spacious, and clean although terribly plain. Don't come for the ambience. Orders are taken at the counter. I ordered the beef panang curry. It was about $9. The portion sizes were a tragedy. Most of the dish was rice. You can ask for more rice if you wish, which is nice. Essentially, you're ordering rice with a side of curry. The curry smelled lovely. It was very fragrant and it tasted good, but it was watery thin and unremarkable. Another reviewer posted a video of the curry-- that's how thin mine was too. The beef was also very thin. 

I also tried the pad ped with tofu and it was extremely disappointing. Again, the dish had rice as it's star and some marinated veggies on the side that I assume was the pad ped. The flavors were not very strong and I couldn't taste the curry at all. It's hard to believe that this cost $9."}
{"text":"I ordered tom yum goong which disappointed me so much! the broth is watery and flavorless, shrimp and veggie are too little compare with the price you pay for. Rice were dry and not warm as if it's leftover. What a waste of $10!! Also on the menu I don't see carrot and green pepper as ingredients (I hate them) but there were....yukkk....never again. 

In short: $10 for the quality of canned soup at grocery store!"}
{"text":"I have came here twice now. Once, when it just opened and now again. The first dish i had was the duck rice. It was overpriced and lacking. I was expecting a grilled duck, but they fried it dry. 

This time, I was recommended to try their yellow curry and they did not fail to disappoint me. Run-down watery curry with meat that taste like dog-food. The taste was bland. Lack the uses of spice and herb. What a disaster.

I am from Thailand and I am very embarrassed for them to call this Thai curry."}
{"text":"Best thai and pho place in CU! My favorites are phat woon sen and chicken pho, but other foods are also great enough."}
{"text":"I ordered the hainan chicken from here and it was essentially four little strips of boiled chicken breast that came with a garlic sauce. The sauce was pretty good but the portion of chicken was just so small. The noodle dishes look alright but don't order the hainan chicken!"}
{"text":"One of the good places to eat with friends and relax. The owners are very nice and polite. Highly recommended to try it and it fills you up!"}
{"text":"The food here is very high-quality, fresh vegetables, crisply served and perfect flavoring. The owner is a pleasant fellow who interacts with all the customers. The food is served on clean china plates and the restaurant is much cleaner and well decorated than most of the campus Asian restaurants.
You'll find it on the south side of Green street between Wright and Sixth.
I often get the yellow chicken curry but they sell red curry and green curry with your choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or tofu.
Degree of \"hotness\" ranges from #1 to #5 and seems to be an accurate wide range from very mild to as hot as any reasonable person would like.  Ask and you shall receive.
Their pho is delicious. Their homemade Ho Fun noodles (wide, chewy and made from rice) are served with the Pad Ke Mao and the Pad Siew.  Great flavors.
They cook with eggplant, basil, green beans, carrot, bamboo shoots, onion, potato, depending on the menu item.  Ask questions to make sure you get what you want."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably my favorite place to get pad thai. I usually get a chicken pad thai with extra lime. Very flavorful dish. 

And the portions this restaurant serves are amazing. For most people, these portions will fill you up for sure. You might even have leftovers for tomorrow. 

The customer service is great! Extremely friendly and nice owners/employees."}
{"text":"My family runs a somewhat high quality Cantonese style restaurant ever since i was a kid.we are from ShenZhen and i can vouch that this place is better than bangkok thai or any of the Chinese style restaurant in town. Especially because they use very little msg and the flavors are flavorful. The owner is also super nice and friendly. Will definitely come here more from now on."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had in my life. Also they give you extra noodles for a dollar which is a deal."}
{"text":"I get the BBQ duck and rice. It's super delicious and the staff are kind to me. I will go back often."}
{"text":"Big fan of the pho served here. The portions are big and it's affordable -- usually less than $9. It's located right next to campus, so I can see myself coming here pretty often."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for cheap, fast, and delicious food.  It is not fancy - it is your basic noodle shop, but with a wonderfully nice family running it, a clean, bright environment, and a decent menu. 

We had the fresh shrimp spring rolls, chicken pad thai (requested spicy), and duck yellow noodle soup.  All were good, but the pad thai was one of the best we've ever had.  At the owner's suggestion, a squirt of lime juice brought it to life (it was already good, though), and the serving was enough for two meals.  The spring rolls were very good, and a good fresh start to the meal.  The duck yellow noodle soup had very generous portions of duck in it, and while it started off a bit bland, the addition of a bit of Hoisin and jalepenos (that's what those accoutrements are for!) it was lovely. I demolished it (and I usually can't finish a bowl of pho). 

For two, with one meal easily making two meals, we spent $24.  Very reasonable in my opinion. 

The only minor quibble I have is that there is no basil or mint with the pho or in the spring rolls. I would imagine that's either chef's choice or a cost thing.  I loved everything we got and this will be a regular stop, however, so it must not be that big of a deal to me."}
{"text":"Just moved into town and needed some pho. Was told this was the spot to go and was not disappointed at all. Owner was super nice and introduced himself and made sure everything was perfect. Seriously you can't go wrong here, the rest of the menu looked amazing and as I was in a state of pho bliss I couldn't partake but next time, yes next time I shall feast on them. 
Great atmosphere, great owner, unbelievable good food."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than pho in a cold day. First time trying pho here, not bad. I would like some basil in the soup."}
{"text":"They have the best pad thai in town so far after trying over 4 thai places. Pho is really good too. Hope they have some more variety and add some desserts such as my favo sticky rice with mango."}
{"text":"I came in on a whim on the way to Panera. The words 'PHO' emblazoned on their window caught my eye and I could have sworn there was a pizza place here last time I remembered seeing it. But my hankering for pho overcame my craving for bagels and without any record to be found via Yelp or Foursquare I went in.

The interior is simple and a little spartan, but it's fine for a little university eatery. Some decorations wouldn't hurt though.

I knew what I wanted coming in. A bowl of beef pho. The decision was a simple one, the only have one option for the different types of meat pho and one size. I wasn't disappointed by the lack of options though. The portion was generous and came out piping hot.

The broth was solid, with a nice round taste and slightly sweet ping. I added some sriracha due to my love for some kick. No hoisin needed for me! 

The noodles were good. Hard to get those wrong. 

Now we get to the meat. Generous amount of meat slices, brisket, and meatball halves. The slices themselves were a little well done, but the taste was still good.

All in all, I'd have a hard to choosing between Bangkok Thai and here for a good bowl of pho. Guess I'll have to take turns!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome levels of spicy from 1-5. Pad Thai and phô on point. My number one spot now!"}
{"text":"The shrimp pho was a good treat on a chilly January afternoon in Champaign. It is served bland, but this can be resolved with bottles of Sriracha and other hot sauces on the counter.

I was disappointed that they don't accept American Express, but that might be just me."}
{"text":"Okay so the three stars is for the pad Thai ONLY. I'm not a fan of curry to begin with, but my sister loves it from here. I can't figure out if I want to give it 3 or 4 stars, because 3.5 is kind of the most fitting. The one thing the pad Thai, and the rice for that matter, has that is just perfect, is texture and quality. If the other Thai places around the area could master the quality and texture of noodle the same way Pho Cafe has, then I wouldn't consider this place ever. In the competition for the best pad Thai's in the area, pho cafe came in 3rd, mostly for noodle quality. The flavor is mediocre at best. Like it isn't bad at ALL, but it isn't great either. The best thing it has is PERFECT noodle quality and texture. Maybe if you were eating a different dish with noodles, you'll end up with a better meal. Also it gets more points for HUGE portions and very decently priced, even for dinner servings."}
{"text":"I ended up getting the green curry. I thought the portions were slightly small which was slightly disappointing factoring the cost of the food. Focusing on the food, I didn't think my dish tasted that great. The juices from the curry definitely did not go well with the rest of the dish. Overall, it's another subpar restaurant in Champaign."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing as usual, but the food quality has really changed since this place opened. They no longer serve extra sides like they used to, such as a simple ingredient of jalapeños (with their pho), and the beef in their pho that they use is tough & low-quality. I used to come here for pho all the time, but now I go to Bangkok Thai. It's unfortunate because I really love the owners/employees here."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic. I've never been a fan of Thai Food, but this is now my new favorite place on campus to eat. Get the PAD THAI. You will not go wrong, i promise that"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The price is reasonable for thai food restaurant on green street. Noodles are very good. Rice dishes are very good too. Everything is so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got traditional beef pho. Overall I would say the pho is about 7 on the lifetime noodle scale. No basil or cilantro is a big neg for me. Also the broth did not have the complexity that I associate with pho. $10 with less veggies seems kinda high."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their cashew chicken. The vegetables are really fresh. The Panang curry was good but not great. Really enjoy the large portions."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This restaurant just recently opened up at the end of December when the students were away and it was featured this week in the local newspaper. I was excited about trying a new \"authentic\" thai restaurant. My prior experience at the other pho restaurant was rather disappointing on green street. When you enter you line up to order at the counter, afterwards you are given a number and wait for them to call you for your meal. I wanted to try the roasted duck with rice or the hainan chicken, but I went with a safe order with the chicken pad thai because they recommended it as one of the signature dishes. It didn't take long for the dish to come out, about 5-7 minutes after I placed my order. The chicken pad thai was a bit lacking in texture and flavors. For a good thai dish, you get the nice crunch of peanuts along with the sweetness and soft texture of noodles. There was a few specks of peanuts and nothing more. The flavors also was very one note, not very sweet like at other places, but also not very exciting. Portion size for the price paid was good. My wife had the tom yom seafood dish. No exotic seafood just some shrimp and mushrooms with lemon grass etc. It seemed to lack the sourness which is often a highlight of the dish. It really is a 2-3 star restaurant. I was hoping for better, maybe it will improve the next time.

Pros: inexpensive thai food, friendly service, good portion size

Cons: flavors and texture are off, maybe they are new but it just doesn't have that specialness which would make you crave this place for thai food

Hidden deals:
None"}
{"text":"When I need my pho in CU, this place is it. Reasonably priced, huge portions, and the service has a great sense of humor."}
