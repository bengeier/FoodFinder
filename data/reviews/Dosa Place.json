{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is a such of sh*t, My first visit to Pittsburg and I was so hungry and I ordered at 12:00 am in the Sheraton Hotel, my worst idea was call them and order, I did wait like one hour for the food. And I called them and they told me that the delivery always take like 20-30 min! I got my food at 1:40 am! The worst service and the worst food. I don't recommend this place in anything."}
{"text":"Would like to review this place, but after accepting the order through EatStreet, the food never arrived. I called and they claimed they never got it, I called EatStreet and they verified with them that they did.  ????
Obviously they can't be trusted. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out on suggestion of some coworkers. We ordered chicken karahi dosa, chicken tikka rolls, and butter paneer dosa for pick up. The place is a little hard to find because it is two restaurants in one (Mama Mia Pizzeria being the more prominent one). We had to wait approximately 15 minutes for our order which we placed 30 minutes before arrival and were told that it would be ready by the time we come. The front staff seemed to be messy and not very cordial or professional. The dosa was soggy and far from authentic. The sambhar with dosa was too less in quantity. They promised three chutneys with the dosa and never gave them. The chicken rolls were average. The parathas in the roll are supposed to be crispy but they weren't. The filling was good but could have been more spicy and juicy. The pizza was very bland for an \"Indian\" pizza. There were chunks of paneer but nothing else about the pizza was \"butter paneer\". We have baked better pizzas at our home. Overall it was a disappointment and I wouldn't go to this place again."}
{"text":"We order via grubhub 1 medium butter chicken and 1 butter panner pizza they where where good"}
