{"text":"I'm between 3&4 stars. The food is surprisingly good, but the service was slow considering we were the only two in the bar. I guess it's a chill kind of place, but it was unnecessarily slow. There was also a slight funky smell. The decor is green roomesque but nothing particularly original. I'd still recommend the place if you're not in a hurry, and it's really not that bad, just nothing impressive about it either. So, what I'm trying to say is : \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Stumbled in here looking for mimosas and ended up finding a great selection of vegan foods. Its not normal to love oatmeal as much as I do so obviously that's what I ordered. They were cooked perfectly; soft and creamy but still with the texture of oats. I was very impressed that it came with a generous portion of REAL maple syrup. Such a treat. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito which is humongous and even though he is as far from vegetarian as you can get, he really enjoyed the tofu scramble filling. The staff were very friendly and attentive as well. The only reason this gets 4 and not 5 is the nasty gross bathrooms. The smell was absolutely disgusting. Someone needs to clean those things."}
{"text":"A wonderful wonderful neighborhood bar with a decent all vegan menu. Very friendly staff and patrons."}
{"text":"Ahhhh.. Lipstick & Dynamite. How much I love thee...Let me count the ways.

Since I moved to the neighborhood over 2 years ago, it has been you that has kept my belly full. When I renovated my kitchen, you fed my every day with delicious vegan noms that gave me energy and made my tastebuds sing.

You are number one local happy hour stop after a long day at work. I know I'll always run into at least a few friends sipping on some hoppy brews at the bar.

What can I say? The staff ROCK, the music is always on point, the food is out of this world, and they have No. 9. The kitschy decor makes you feel right at home, and if that's not enough, pull out one of the board games from their massive collection for a bar-wide game night."}
{"text":"Very inclusive!!! Didnt feel ostracised at all.  Im a quadrisexual and they welcomed me and my bisexual mulatto boyfriend in like we were regulars.  There were noisy entitled college students there, but the management removed them almost immediately. 10/10 will go again next time im in toronto"}
{"text":"This is my local bar of choice. There's a nice selection of microbrews on tap - not so many that you need to worry about the kegs being old, but enough that you've got options.
Bar rail drinks are reasonably priced and there's lots of thoughtful little touches like electrical outlets near the tables so you can charge your phone.
Music is awesome - just my kind of 80/90/00s alternative that perfectly suits the atmosphere, and they don't play it too loud. Decor is also perfect.. How many velvet paintings can one bar have? L&D aims to find out!
I can't comment on the food, as I've only had bar snacks here once or twice - it is definitely a place I'd consider a bar, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend and I travelled from the east end to go for a bite to eat. Our initial thoughts were this was a cute dive bar. The initial server was funny and served drinks right away. She gave up and never came back. She left. Then a guy took over bartending. We asked for a menu. 45 minutes later no offer of drinks or food. We actually persisted thinking this was funny but it eventually enraged us. We paid the bill and left. Maybe we didn't have enough facial hair for this hipster crowd of 4 or 5. Dear manager, train your staff to acknowledge their customers (keep off their cell phones, don't just focus on the 3 regulars who walked up to the bar to order drinks). Honestly, I would consider going back and giving the food a try if you just said you had a meeting with your staff. 
We were 3 feet away from the bartender and he didn't even look over."}
{"text":"L&D is a little dive bar with a pinball machine in the back and some board games. I came here a few times to play Scrabble and drink beer with random folks and always have a good time. The bartenders are super funny and good people with good sense of humour. Rotating taps always feature locally-brewed beer which is great. Vegan brunch options are also so, so delicious."}
{"text":"Dropped by when it first opened and tried the local brewed watermelon wheat beer on tap which was great. Interesting decor, music and board games. I went back and tried it the veggie food which was great. Not super busy or noisy place which is to have a conversation over a drink. Nice dive bar."}
{"text":"A combination of dive bar, awesome food, and fantastic service!

Ever since L&D opened we've been coming to have drinks and snacks, or outright meals. It's got a decent selection of drinks with some cool beers on tap and a fridge full of bottles & cans. Rail drinks are just like you expect at any dive-y bar, with prices to match.

The food is not what you'd expect, and not just because everything is vegetarian or vegan. While the menu changes from time to time, the quality and speed of service is always excellent. A standout is the oven-baked fries with the exceedingly great homemade ketchup (always ask for a 2nd helping!). The kale caesar is also tasty - we've made the trek out here on several occasions simply to get that.

But I think that above all what really makes this place stand out is its excellent service and the way that you're treated when you walk in the door. It's a nice level of nonchalance combined with a real warmth- we always feel so welcome.

And the velvet paintings rock!"}
{"text":"We had such high hopes based on the other reviews on here.  However, when we went, there wasn't a cook working, the taps were broken (or something like that), and the place was completely empty except for the bartender, who was a super nice bloke (english guy?).  It just sucks because we were starving and looking for a vegetarian dish and a cold beer.  Swing and a miss!  Groovy atmosphere though.  I'll try it again next trip maybe."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's cool. Drinks are average, the art on the wall is hilarious and a good conversation piece. I especially liked the Elvis Zombie bust...
I went on a Thursday night, so not sure if it gets packed on the weekends or not, but it was pretty empty when I was there, and the food and drinks were all average prices and decent. The music is cool, very rockabilly. It is pretty small so I imagine people from the hood running into acquaintances a lot there. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Yet another delicious meal at this amazing vegan bar 
The lentil soup and cornbread are delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, lovely service. A little loud for my taste, but we stumbled in not knowing where else to feed four very hungry vegetarians. The portions on everything but the taco salad were pretty small, but it's bar and meant to go with beer, I imagine."}
{"text":"Not too bad but dirty bathroom and one bottle of cider cost me $8."}
{"text":"Ok so imagine that is Halloween all year around, that's the deco inside the place ... the service is great... their Caesar mix and the food not so much, we didn't returned the food because the cook is right besides de bar haha we didn't want to make her feel bad but the food was horrible :( we pretended to be really full and then shoot two shots of Jameson because we felt we were going to be sick ... I really wanted to like this place but we are not coming back eveerrrr"}
{"text":"Now, here's a place that time after time I walk by. An opportunity presented itself  and I took my shot! 

It's dark in here so it's hard to see what you're eating or drinking. That being said it makes no bones about being a dive bar.

It's fun and quirky with a queen west 'west' vibe. The only downfall is the bathroom. Yowzers! That needs some help. I tell you if that was good I might have given this .... maybe a 5.

I wish the space was bigger. I like the concept. I wish there were more retro pinball machines. Suits it, for sure.

If you don't mind having to talk a little louder than normal or who knows maybe it was because it was a Friday night. It's a pretty chill place to hang with friends. Be warned not a lot of space for large groups think small group of friends."}
{"text":"Great place! Bartenders are just as great as the food. Service is fantastic, and the velvet paintings really give the ambiance of hanging out in a quirky, welcoming environment.

Make sure you try the Vegan Po Boy or Portobello Reuben. Good selection of beers on tap. Prices extremely reasonable. 

Get here early on Friday or Saturday. Place fills up quickly and can be at capacity. 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the intro Dil. Let me help flesh out the final verdict. Lipstick & Dynamite is, pun intended, dynamite! I stopped in post checking out Citizenry after one of the owners of Citizenry recommended L & D (FYI: Citizenry is a phenomenal cafe/boutique a few shops over). The food at Lipstick & Dynamite is great, and the service is wonderful. I got asked by two different employees (owner and cook) how my food was. How often can you say that?

The food is all vegetarian and vegan (there are some things with cheese that can be made with vegan cheese) but you would have no clue just looking at the exterior/interior of the restaurant. And you carnivores and omnivores out there, you will not miss anything when it comes to the food here. I eat milk and meat, and I just had one of the best sandwiches of my life and it was vegan. With Joni Mitchell playing on the stereo and a dive bar feel, this place cannot be pigeonholed into any one category. A big hell yes to L & D. Thank you for staying open late and for being so reasonably priced. You are a wholesome alternative to pricier options on the Ossington Strip. 

Definitely give this place a try if you are hungry or down for some drinks."}
{"text":"I really struggled with 2 vs 3 stars on this one.  But to me, 3 stars means I'm likely to return, 2 stars means I probably won't.  Sorry L&D but I doubt I'll be making a return visit.  I had high hopes based on the positive reviews, but overall this spot left me with a decidedly \"meh\" feeling.  

Contrary to what some reviewers have said we found the service to be great when we stopped by for lunch on a Friday.  But that's really the only area where I'd give high marks.  The space is very dark, which works for a dive bar, but doesn't work as well as a restaurant space during the day.  The menu had lots of enticing vegan friendly options, but the food proved disappointing.  I got a seitan sandwich with a side of the thai inspired daily soup.  The soup came in an exceptionally small bowl and was pretty bland tasting.  The sandwich bread was weird and almost seemed a bit under-baked with a moist/mushy texture.  The filling was just okay.  Bf got the chilli cheese fries (not vegan) and they were okay, but again, nothing special.  We both felt the portion size and taste were not a good value in relation to price.  For a comparable option that's executed much better check out the E L Ruddy Cafe on Dundas near Dufferin."}
{"text":"Great little cheap dive bar with a dimly lit vibe and vegetarian twist. Had the Jamaican patty (lentil beans inside) with a fresh Mango slaw for $9. Solid choice for what I paid for. Beers on draft are all local.  

The only thing I didn't like was cash only (totally expected, to be honest). There's an ATM at the back though but didn't appreciate the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Love the staff, drinks, and all the fabulous art in the bar. The vibe is very laid back and relaxed. They have board games too! Always a good time!"}
{"text":"My friend and I walked by this place a couple weeks ago and noticed delicious looking tacos a person was eating.  We stopped and looked at the menu and noticed there was a pint and sandwich deal for $12!  I have been back two times since. 

Lipstick and Dynamite has an amazing atmosphere, food, drinks and staff. 

Lipstick and Dynamite has a super 80s vibe, always playing old music and movies(!!!).  It is such a comfortable and cozy place to be in. There are tables, comfy couches in the back, and obviously a bar to sit at.  There are books in the back available for reading, and an assortment of games to play.  Such a fun place.  

Although Lipstick and Dynamite is a bar, it has an amazing selection of delicious vegetarian food. I have been super satisfied with everything I have had.  The first thing I tried was the cauliflower poboy sandwich.  The sandwich had roasted cauliflower, tofu, artichoke hearts, and other things I can't remember.  It had so many layers of flavour and was so delicious. On my next visit I tried the walnut tacos.  They had walnut taco meat, a jalapeño pineapple salsa, slaw, sprouts and more.  Again, so fresh and SO many layers of flavour.  On my most recent visit I had the kale caeser salad.  It came with tempeh bacon, a large amount of home made croutons and covered in nutritional yeast.  I also tried the new brownies that they are offering.  They came with a raspberry sauce that was so good that I almost licked the plate clean. 

The staff is super friendly and always very welcoming. 

Seriously, I am so happy that I discovered this place while wandering down queen west."}
{"text":"FYI: Cash only!

I came here for lunch around noon during the week. I had never heard of this restaurant before, only decided to check it out because of the yelp reviews. 

Firstly, this place is dimly light, and the Deco was pretty awesome. Loved the old school couches in the back and the random art along the walls. 

I checked out the menu and loved that everything was veggie inspired, I was super eager to try out a handful of items but clearly that's a tad too much food for one person so I settled for the Reuben sandwhich (mushrooms, cheese, sauerkraut) and upgraded my garden salad for a Cesar salad $2. Everything can be made Vegan so I asked for that option to see what it was like. It was good! I wasn't sure what to expect but was happy with my choice and my upgrade. It was the right mix of flavours and textures. I was very happy with my meal and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Walking into Lipstick & Dynamite for the first time reminded me of walking into one of those bars I would have thought was so cool and edgy back when I was a 12-year-old watching Reality Bites. It has fully embraced the tacky-chic aesthetic I remember from those glory days. I mean this in the best possible way. Really. 

The walls are covered in velvet paintings, there is usually a weird movie (Howard the Duck, anyone?) playing behind the bar, the whisky is served in glasses you would probably see at your grandma's house. Plus, the bar tenders are super welcoming. I hear they have food (including a delicious vegan brunch) but I've never been in before 11pm so I will have to get back to you on that."}
{"text":"The land of superheroes and horses as well as naked chicks on paintings. Had a great date and took her home...my wife that is."}
{"text":"Eccentric and bizarrely appointing, this is a great dive bar.  It is long and narrow with a broad selection of beer.  We wound up here because it was open in the early afternoon when most other bars surrounding it weren't.  It was nearly empty but I imagine it is a lot more busy at night.  The staff was very friendly and the space was fun."}
{"text":"This great grunge-y weirdness has been only a few blocks away from me for years, and I somehow just had a drink here. I was a fool to not come sooner.

Dark, fun clientele and bartenders and walls of velvet paintings. Honestly, what's better than catching up with a buddy over vodka sodas in front of some velvet paintings? Not much. Additionally, if you don't like the person you're drinking a vodka soda with that much, no need to talk to them, Lipstick & Dynamite has games, too."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends for dinner, and we needed some vegan options. There was lots to choose from! I had the soup of the day, which was Morroccan Cauliflower, with a kale Caesar salad. It was delicious. My friend had the Tempeh salad which was also good. The thing we all most loved about this place was the atmosphere! Steve, one of the owners, was super friendly and laid back. He chats with the patrons and makes everyone feel welcome. There are games and books, so it's a fun place to hang out for awhile.will definitely go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm so jealous of Toronto's divey queer bar scene.

In any case, this place was exactly what my buddy and I needed in the middle of a rainy Tuesday. We arrived early in the afternoon and were able to get our drink on (with a pretty good tap selection for a dive!) as well as enjoy some light vegan fare over an overly competitive game of scrabble.

The service was positively lovely and the space is kitschy, dark and everything you hope for. Throughout the couple of hours we were there nothing but 90s and 2000s girl rock was playing. Totally my kinda establishment."}
