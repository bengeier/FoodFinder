{"text":"Great Donner and lovely staff This is one of the few places that make shawarma like it should be."}
{"text":"We need platters of food for my son's birthday party nearby so after a bit of research, we decided to order from Best Istanbul and I'm so glad we did!! When we went to pick up, the staff were friendly and attentive, making sure we had what we needed.   The food was incredible so much so that our guests kept asking where we ordered it from so they can go back.  And the portions were huge!!! Our order was for 14 people but it easily fed about 20, plus leftovers.   I would highly recommend Best Istanbul if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service from both the waitress and the chefs behind the counter. They all greeted me with a smile when I walked in. Place was really bright and clean.   Their menu has pictures for every dish, which I found very helpful. I ordered a chicken doner plate and an assorted pide. I found the chicken doner to be a bit dry. The assorted pide was delicious! It came with five different toppings. Two slice for each topping. So it's good for sharing with another person. Crust was nice and crispy. They each came with a side salad which was okay. I found it a bit too tart for my liking and sprinkled some salt to cut down on the sourness. We also got the complimentary pita which came with hot sauce and garlic sauce. I recommend that you eat the pita asap because it turns really hard once it has cooled. I didn't get the tomato dip which was mentioned by an earlier reviewer. Maybe they only give that one out to big groups or discontinued it?  Minor thing I didn't like was that when I asked for water, I was automatically given a water bottle instead of free tap water.  I'm definitely coming back here for more pide and maybe the other meat dishes. They have a front display counter with raw meat so you know those are made to order."}
{"text":"It was the worst iskender kebap that I've ever eaten. It was like half of very small meats and half of fat. I couldn't eat tail fats... disgust me... really, one of my worst experience."}
{"text":"Best kebab and doner indeed. Sooo delicious, nice portions, great price and very good service.  Going again for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here today as recommended by yelp' reviews as a good place and it impressed me even more than expected. Ordered the lentil soup and the combo for 2 and they were both delicious ( combo comes with 4 different type of meat and all of them equally great )..   thumbs up also for the portion size, fulfilling 2 people and still took almost half of it at home. it wasn't full but still great service.    I recommend this place as well and for sure gonna be back."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma, good flavor and huge size,  staff is very helpful and place us super clean, for sure I am going back for more."}
{"text":"Best turkish food in Toronto! The donair is amazing, ask for the half chicken half beef... Sooooooo good... Homemade hot sauce and yogurt is excellent and the homemade bread...to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered the platter for 4 which included beef/lamb, chicken schwarma, beef kebabs, chicken kebabs, gyros, and 2 kinds of rice! We only ate half. All meats were succulent and tasty! We also ordered the Turkish version of pizza with veggies, cilantro, mozzarella and feta cheese! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! A little pricy tho...the Donaire meat was super flavourful and sooo tender!! Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Chicken döner wrap uses a nice thin wrap, closer to a burrito than a pita. Quantity of meat is substantial. Balance of flavours is quite nice. Prices start at $10 to keep the school kids away but I'd say it's a much better value per dollar than Chipotle Mexican Grill"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the servings are huge and a plus for us is that nothing was burnt.  The service is not as attentive as we would have liked, but it was very busy. The staff were friendly though and the restaurant itself was clean and spacious. I would come back and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat Turkish food."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and each time the service has been top-notch.   This here is a Turkish restaurant with a good size menu. The seating space is ample and lot of parking at the back.  Now the food! Every time I got their mix doner kebab plate... The meat was tender and well cooked, it tasted amazing even without any sauces.  The portion size was good, the plate came with rice, salad and meat.   We usually go as bunch of people during lunch so they bring 3 types of dips and a big Naan bread fresh from the oven.   I also tired their Turkish coffee and it was spectacular! and hit the spot.  Overall, I would say very well run, clean restaurant with good food and service.  For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meet at this location    P.S. - My coworker didn't finish here wrap and the owner ask if the food was ok and she stated that she asked what are the topping and the server forgot to mention beets and she doesn't like beets at all and he was nice enough to make here a new one on the go."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of shawarma in this town, and Best Istanbul is truly the best! Any time I'm in the area, I have to make sure to stop by.   Hold one of their shawarmas and it's like you're cradling a baby. It's heavy, warm, and you know you're going to love it for the rest of your life.   The flavours are absolutely delicious, and it's packed full of ingredients! I feel like I've stepped into Turkey and I'm not sure I ever want to go home.  I'm one happy customer, and I'm sure others will be too!"}
{"text":"We went with our 3 young kids today and were very happy with the overall experience! The staff and food were both amazing!! Bathroom was clean and had a changing table for the baby.  I would recommend the mixed kebab plate for 2. It was a huge portion. Desserts were good too. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the meat dish for two. Wow, I have to say the dish is a great value for two, considering the portion of food you'll get. I'll visit this place again in the future."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant I've been in Toronto. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for mediterranean food. thx"}
{"text":"Went out for dinner on a thursday late night, could not be more pleasantly surprised by this place. We ordered iskender, pide, lamb chops and desserts. The main dishes came with side salads. The portions were big for the price, and every dish tasted amazing. The rice pudding was delicious, but we were more surprised how good the künefe was. It was hot and fresh, not greasy at all. Every bite melts right in your mouth. The künefe there is a must try."}
{"text":"Last night I decided to try a restaurant / hot table recommended by a restauranteur and unofficial Turkish ambassador friend of mine from the office. Tucked away at the corner of Keele and Wilson is the deceivingly spacious Best Kebab and Doner. When I walked in I immediately noticed a wood burning oven and the smell of delicious bread baking. Great first impression.  My wife and I  sat down to order and were welcomed by a friendly and knowledgeable waitress who taught us about some of the more traditional menu items.  We ordered the Turkish Pide, lentil soup and chicken kebab meal. Complimentary bread and yogurt/tomato/cucumber  dip comes with your order. It is similar to Tzatziki  but better . The bread is inflated with hot steam like a balloon so you must poke it and allow it to deflate a little before eating.  That was the most fun!   This place likes to add a little kick to their dishes. It was a little spicy for my wife but I love pepper so my opinion is a little biased.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The lentil soup was subtle yet satisfying.  The kebab was succulent and the Pide made in the wood burning oven was fantastic and true to the Turkish tradition.   Portion sizes were very generous and prices are reasonable .   If you chose to be seated in the back you will see pictures of all of the iconic Turkish sites including Roman baths and a Massive  ancient  Cistern among other visual delights.  An awesome experience!"}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is how big and bright the restaurant is. It is definitely not your typical dingy shawarma joint. They have displays of the raw kebabs, desserts, and garnishes.  The menu had a wide range of Turkish dishes, but for my first time, I decided to go with the safer chicken kebab plate (to go). Two skewers were immediately put onto the grill, so you know it is fresh! I also got a knafeh, which is a turkish dessert that resembles a block of fried noodles topped with pistachios.  The chicken was tasty and juicy. The vegetables tasted fresh. The pita bread tasted a bit stale, but I guess it was because I came in after dinner. The server was also very friendly. Will definitely try their other menus when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Lalezar Kebab and the Chicken/Beef Shish...loved it! Tasty but not too salty. Our server was friendly and accommodating. Prices reasonable. What more can we ask? Place is clean, bright and spacious. Thank you!!  Almost forgot, a lovely Turkish coffee to finish off. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Yoooooooo!!!  I'm just going to be real....this place is Fiyaaaaah!!  Next door to costa verde (which is also fiyah) at keele and wilson is Best Kebab & Doner- a Turkish family owned restaurant that is just doing the most amazing things in the north west part of town. The furniture is not all that- but if you see the kitchen- you will realize where most of the money was spent for this operation.  Char grill, Shawarma rottiserie's , stone oven's for turkish pizza's and glass displays for fresh meat. You know that you are getting some quality stuff just from the sight of their kitchen.  Menu was also innovative- a 2 sided laminated sheet with items pictured and description below. It was very easy to pick what you desire- even if you are a novice to the Turkish cuisine. We ordered the Lazelar kebab and also a beef doner dinner.  The Lazelar dinner was an experience on its own. lamb skewer plated over eggplants and covered with cheese. My brain was amazed and confused. It felt like I had all my favorite things in my mouth. Am I eating BBQ? rack of lamb? Is that Baba Ganoush?? charred meat with melted mozzerala? what? So good....  I cannot take anything away from the beef doner- however I would much prefer it in a sandwich instead of the dinner I got. The doner was a thing of its own. Ever walk in to a shawarma place and debate if you want a gyro or beef shawarma?  say no more fam- Booom! The doner at best kebab tasted like a combination of the both!!   Im adding this to my top 10 list in this area of Toronto.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food and costomer service was really good. We tried their Iskander and it was honestly delicious! We also tried their desserts and they were amazing. would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place tried a Turkish desert... service was good the only reason did not give five stars because we wanted to order tea and 4 hours before closing they ran out of tea! So we had to buy tea from Tim Horton's (they allowed us)."}
{"text":"Undecided on how I feel about this place. I mean in terms of food it has been amazing as far as their plates go. Although the service seems to be very slow I have waited over 30 minutes for a take out order once(and there was only one other table occupied so it wasn't busy). It seems to be very clean and the cooks are very friendly. A bit pricier than your average shawarma/doner place. Overall Great food, service & price kind of dims it down. Definitely worth a try though if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If there is any place that deserves a 5 star, its this one.  We reserved a spot for two people 20 minutes prior to getting there, they get busy on Ramadan weekends around evening.  Service: 5/5 There were only two servers managing the whole dining area which was jam packed, however, they were so graceful and efficient! Our server got us water and dates pretty much as soon as we sat down, took our order within a few minutes, salad came after a few minutes and then the mains came. At no point did we feel like we were waiting for something to come.  Food: 4/5  Salad and Turkish tea ON THE HOUSE! and both of them were soo good. I had two refills of Turkish tea thats how much i liked it.  Iskander Kabab, very good and HUGE potions, I don't think its possible for a regular person to finish the whole portion by him/herself. It was very well made and had generous amount of beef.  Adane Kabab, flavourful and juicy. Usually middle easter places dry their kabab and it doesn't have a loot of seasoning, but these were very well seasoned.  We also got a Pide which was freshly made, very well done and again HUGE serving.  Got Kanafe at the end and its one of the best I have had in GTA.  Environment: Nothing much to write about here, it was exceptionally clean including the washrooms and was spacious.  We got here after a whole day of shopping while fasting, the food and service here made me forget how tired and grumpy i was, I was genuinely happy after a meal here and would definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to Toronto a couple of times and tried Turkish places there, they were under my expectations. We were driving by my wife saw it and said lets try it. Made my U turn and walked in. The first thing i will look in a place how clean they are. When i walked in, my first impression was that, the place is super clean and organized. I looked at the doners lamb and chicken, fantastic. We sat down, ordered combo lamb and chicken doner platter, beef shish kebab wrap, sucuk pide. They were all amazing. We also ordered lentil soup, not that great, didnt taste like lentils, too much flour and watered down. Over all they will get 5 stars, and will recommend everybody that i know. Making my next travel plans to Toronto already, so i can go and eat over there again. Dont forget to have your tea as well!"}
{"text":"The name isn't a lie, this place really is the best!  I came here for dinner one night and had the Iskender Kebab. The food was delicious, and it came with a good quality side salad. There was also some sort of very thick yogurt on the side that I really enjoyed. I would absolutely return to this restaurant if I'm passing through Toronto again."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting thin crust flatbread. Tastes fresh and good portion for price.  The menu can definitely have a makeover but otherwise good spot for the family or friends."}
{"text":"I came here with 4 coworkers and we got 3 different plates, the beef, chicken and Iskender. The Iskender (beef and bread pieces cooked with tomato sauce and served with yogurt) was the most expensive but also the most delicious, by far. The tomato flavours and yogurt combined in the best way, I'm still thinking about it the morning after. The beef and chicken plates were decent too, the meat quality is higher than what you get across the street, IMO. You can get free refillable pitas to go with your plates so you can make mini shawarmas if you want, and garlic/hot sauce.   Would recommend, would return, would get the Iskender plate again."}
{"text":"We were a party of five. It was our favorite place in town. The food was absolutely amazing. We had tried the mixed grill, iskander, shawarma beef wrap, and the Turkish pizzas, kunafa and Turkish tea. The food was so good we went back 3 days in a row! It was fresh, and full of taste and flavor. The restaurant was clean and spacious.  Thank you Best Istanbul for making our visit to town unforgettable :)"}
{"text":"I love #4 beef-shees on the menu! It's a Turkish version of something I really like from the middle east and Mediterranean regions. Here it's rather simple in servings, being side salad, rice and few veges, oh and bread. But the taste is so good with their own side sauces! They really concentrate on the quality of their meats. Kudos to that.  Tip. Eat this on site, not take out. Take out always looses a good part of the taste for many like me."}
{"text":"It really pains me to write this review.  The chefs who work there are really nice, friendly and accommodating people.  They work hard at providing their customers with a good meal.  But this is where it turns unfortunate:  The woman who runs this place does not like me and has always been discourteous to me.  I don't know why - but it has always been like that.  This is enough for me to say that I will never go back there again.  As good as the food is, it just goes to prove:  TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WELL AND THEY WILL RETURN.  Bye bye!  I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I am not sure where all the stars and so many great reviews are coming from, but we were very disappointed.  Service, food and cleanliness  of the place far from even 3 stars."}
{"text":"Çay güzel , sütlaç güzel , kaday?f?n tad? uygun ama teller biraz kuru geldi. Ama Toronto ?artlar?nda güzel diyebilirim."}
{"text":"terrible service waited for at least 45 minutes for my food meanwhile people who were coming in after me were being served first"}
