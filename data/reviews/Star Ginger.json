{"text":"I had some take outs from the casino location but was very disappointed.  My shrimp curry plate had 3 little shrimps and the salad on the side had a very little dressing.  The noodle salad that was prepared ahead was very mushy.  Overall, all my take outs had smaller portions than usual.  Been there about 5 times and never had this problem before."}
{"text":"Excellent Beef Pho.  

The beef broth was flavorful and for $7.00 the bowl was large enough for two, except you'll want your own.

The only downside is that Star Ginger is in the casino food court.  For us it was crowded and the tables dirty.

They do have takeout though....."}
{"text":"I decided to try them for dinner on Saturday @ 5pm while spending the weekend at Wild Horse   Pass. I ordered the green curry chicken with noodles and was told they were out of noodle. It's not like they had a big rush on noodles because there was no one in line ahead or behind me.  I had to have it with white rice which was dry and no flavor. The man took my order was also bland and no personality. I will skip Star Ginger on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many people have given this place 5 stars but I am going to.  I had the Tofu Pho tonight and it was delicious.  I couldn't believe the number of pieces of tofu they gave me, but even more incredible was the broth.  A very good broth infused with star anise flavor.  Noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, fresh basil, and lime all added to this amazing broth made my trip to this casino well worth it.  So if you can't win at the tables, try a table at Star Ginger and eat any of the Phos they offer (chicken, beef and tofu) and you will be indeed a winner.  Saw the mongolian beef which looked amazing.  I will try that out next time.  A 5 star rating for a food court spot in a casino?  You Betcha!"}
{"text":"I don't know what-the-pho the person who gave this place 4 stars was thinking....they must have been drunk and high.  Not even close to the real thing. Kind of disappointing after waiting a really long time. They have multiple burners and only one pot of water going....doesn't make sense in a fast paced environment to cripple your line by doing one single plate at a time. Asked for hoisen and soy sauce...I was told they were out.....really???"}
{"text":"Surprised at quality ! I got beef and broccoli over white rice and low mein. The beef tasted fresh not fatty at all the rice was perfectly cooked sauce was good.. The only thing id say is too many big chunks of onion In the noodles and they were out of my fav coco water :( way better than delivery at least any chinese you can get out in az."}
{"text":"I will be back again. The Pho was delicious! I ordered the tofu and vegetable pho which was made to order. This bowl was big enough for two but I ate it all because it was so good. What a pleasant surprise to find such a jewel at a casino. For only $7, I will be back again."}
{"text":"Were staycationing at Wild Horse Pass Casino, and after a day poolside, I decided Pho from the Food Court sounded like a good idea. I was wrong! 

Went with the chicken Pho, the broth had no body, the noodles were limp, and the chicken was dried out and awful. Plenty of basil, jalapeño and typical accompaniments could not save this. He got Banh Mi which he enjoyed, Green Curry Chicken appeared to have the same flavorless, dry chicken as my Pho, and abysmal looking spring rolls and potstickers. 

Would not return, and I've been officially banned from choosing food after daydranking ;) Thankfully, it was a comped meal."}
{"text":"More like 3.75 stars.  I stopped in for a light lunch and decided on their chicken wings which were pretty good.  It was a nice light snack.  Food is made to order so it may take a couple of minutes but at least you know it has not been sitting around awhile.  Located in the casino food court, you order your food then find a seat somewhere to eat."}

Mom wanted to try the pho, so she chose the \"Vietnamese Pho,\" with chicken (other choices were beef, and tofu and veggies) from the two noodle choices (the other one was Spicy Thai Noodles).  Since Star Ginger only serves rice noodles and rice entrees, I couldn't eat here... There were salad options available, but I wanted noodles, or the grilled/stir-fried entrees with more meat and veggies.  Sadly, these too are made with sauces and seasonings laced with cornstarch and other allergens I must stay away from.  I noticed the guy before me had his hand around a glass of Thai iced tea, so I wanted to try one for myself.  It was one of the best Thai iced teas I've tried! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/star-ginger-chandler?select=yVLaabkuwbwkDM2-jc0-Dg#yVLaabkuwbwkDM2-jc0-Dg  Just sweet and creamy enough for me to enjoy without feeling like I'm blasting my system with too much sugar and saturated fat.  :)

Mom seemed to enjoy her pho, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/star-ginger-chandler?select=YWls92COlK5fq_ed_Nhwcg#YWls92COlK5fq_ed_Nhwcg and I asked if it was better than the pho she had at Pho Thanh, and she said no.  (I tried the soup and found it to be tasty!)  It was good enough for tonight...  If I stay at Wild Horse Pass Resort again and Mom visits, she might try a stir-fry here, or she may just opt for Fatburger, or Famiglia Pizza and Pasta...  I will definitely order Star Ginger's Thai iced tea.  :)

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Located in the Wild Horse Pass Casino food court, Star Ginger provides a quick and satisfying meal for lunch, dinner or late-night nosh.

Atmosphere: 
-food court; loud, noisy, crowded, somewhat dirty
-not an ideal place for a date

Food:
-I usually order the green curry which never disappoints
-large portion sizes (enough for 2 meals for me)
-pre-made, cannot be made to order
-cannot be made spicier, they give you a side of sriracha upon request
-can order to-go, which I suggest anyway so you can take home leftovers

Service:
-prompt, much quicker than some of the other food court restaurants

All in all, my favorite stop at the Wild Horse Pass food court, great particularly after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Pho? At a casino food court? Do I dare? These questions (All valid ones to ask when you're hungry and craving something soup-like) floated through my head as I pondered over the menu at Star Ginger. As it turns out, Star Ginger serves up a decent bowl of pho, for $7. You have your choice of beef or chicken, and it is made to order as soon as you pay for your meal at the cashier.

The pho was a sizable portion in a large bowl. I chose chicken, and there were a lot of white meat chicken chunks in the bowl, as well as freshly shredded onion, pho noodles, and cilantro. The broth was rich and a little unctuous, and there was a plate of fresh basil, bean sprouts, and lime wedge on the side. They also included a disposable soup spoon and a small container of sriracha and hoisin sauce. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of this meal. They did a decent job with the pho dish, and if I were at this food court again, I definitely wouldn't mind trying another bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"We orders the Spicy Thai noodles with chicken. When presented to us, the dish consisted of a large bowl of what appeared to be soup along with undercooked vegetables and small bites of chicken. The taste of ginger permeated this bowl of dreck. I think I could have gotten a better meal from the floor of a stadium after a game."}
{"text":"One bowl pho is enough for two people, Cos the portion is quite big. The price around $7. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Vietnamese phao Chicken around.  Whenever we have a taste for noodles we come here.  This dish is not heavy at all but just enough to take the edge off..If you are at WHP stop in and see, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The Pho is Hugh very flavorful easy to share
The service was great 
Fast friendly & helpful
Yummy chicken wings sauce on side 
Pot stickers were amazing sorry no pic
Ate quickly"}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant surprises I've felt in metropolitan Phoenix is eating up solidly impressive food inside a food court (Oh wha?!) in a Vegas-style casino (Say whaaaaa?!) called Wild Horse Pass (don't know, don't ask). 

During our Saturday night Star Ginger happened to have the longest line (thanks to a concert that night), viciously ousting other order-by-counter eateries, including Fatburger.  This cuisine is best described as a blend of Thai & Vietnamese, with some of the Americanized Chinese dishes that wished to be eaten, as explicitly displayed as a point-point method.  Nonetheless ordering it took a tolerably long while to pick up our entrees--the ones that weren't sitting in those warming pots.

DL was interested to try the enormously portioned Thai Noodle Soup ($6.95).  We took a few sips of his Thai curry-style coconut milk broth, & the 4 of us concurred that maybe a few pieces of tofu would counter better w/ this subtly strong aroma, rather than heavily relying on either the sweet carrots or the chewy beef slices.  The baby bok choy in the soup matched excellently w/ the zingy liquid, but the noodles could have been cooked in a lesser amount of time, resulting in a personally unpleasant softness of the white noodle texture.

I also snatched a few pieces of Angela T's generously piled Grilled Pork Chop ($7.95), amusingly chopped in bite-sized pieces.  With the passably stout fish sauce, served on the side, the pork was remarkably tender.  As for Kurdy S's Pho ($6.95), by his facial expression we could tell that Pho should be bought elsewhere, even though it was also gigantically served.

My dish, the copious helping of their Thai BBQ Chicken ($7.95), was the luckiest of the 4 =P--and why I gave this place a 3.5 overall.  It was not only impeccably tender & chunky, but the charred flavor & small seasonings positively stood out, especially when either dipped w/ the spiced-up coconut green curry (also served on the side, albeit w/ less viscosity), the perfectly moist white rice, or the invigorating, equally healthy & plentiful, crunchy, Asian slaw--with hints of mint to bring more oomph to the veggies.  In short: this might be the reason why there was that curiously long line.

So if the food offered in the Phoenix Premium Outlets seem unimpressive, make that inexcusably short drive to Star Ginger at the Wild Horse Pass Casino for the clucker.  But I do want to apologize in advance that food isn't at superb quality (if that's what you desire) & that, depending on arrival, security will not allow folks aged 21-and-less to enter.  This food court staff will undoubtely feed you well, in case you need another short-term cure of losing either the roulette machine or the 2-cent slots."}
{"text":"One of the worse fast food experience I've tasted as far as an Asian grill goes. I don't even want to waste too much time on this review since I wasted enough time eating at this place. The staff seemed bitter and careless just how their food was. If you do decide to eat at this place I'll tell you what not to order.

First off I wanted to try a different dish but I had to settle with a third option, since the first two they were out of. I requested Teriyaki chicken since it was the only edible looking dish they had to offer (I was wrong about that), with a side of white rice. 

The teriyaki chicken had a bad flavor and bad texture that I didn't know if it went bad or it is how they prepared it. I took several bites but was afraid to continue any further because I was afraid how I would feel afterwards. 

Overall, I will never return to this place nor I would recommend it to anyone else. There are other places literally next to each other that would be a better option."}
