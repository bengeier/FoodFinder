{"text":"I had the Italian sub with the strawberry lemonade. I can say with confidence that the quality of the sub is like non other. Very fresh ingredients and excellent customer service. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great subs and always fresh. Great new products with delicious smoothies and new \"rolled\" ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this spot for lunch!!  It's the old Port of Subs with the same great sandwiches, and new items like smoothies. They're so friendly and I think prices have gone down too!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this local establishment. Their ingredients were fresh and they use quality meats and cheeses. If you like Port of Subs, you'll like Fresh Sub. The owner is very friendly and ensures you are happy with your order. Their prices are great too, at least $2.00 to $3.00 cheaper than other places. Definitely has become a weekly stop for me. A bonus on serving hand crafted, fresh rolled ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this place! When you order a sandwich here they slice the meat fresh! Also, you can get any sandwich in salad form.  The staff is super friendly and the place is clean. They also do fruit smoothies and a good ice cream selection that they use to make ice cream rolls.  Overall this is a great place for lunch or an after dinner dessert."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local sandwich place and I found Fresh Subs. Its clean and spacious inside but the best part is the owner and the subs. Super fast service and OMG! The new Korean bbq fresh sub is amazing. 
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice place to go during lunch break. Freshly sliced meat and veggie was good and love their strawberry lemonade smoothie!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Highly recommend the Italian sub. The freshly made bread is piled high with cold cuts and your favorite toppings. After I wolfed my sub I finished off lunch with rolled chocolate sundae with coconut. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sub, this is the place to be! Super fresh ingredients and the homemade bread makes all the difference. This is a little mom and pop that's doing it right. It's hidden behind the Arco and Wendys on Flamingo and Jones. Definitely a better choice in my opinion than the fast food joints and chains."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The subs are fresh with delicious ingredients and I absolutely love the Green Tea Frappe! But you have to try the Rolled Ice Cream it is new and hip and absolutely delicious! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Forget about subway!!!!! This place has the best subs and their mango mania smoothies are one of the best I've tasted! Always end it with a giant chocolate chip cookie too ;). New ice cream bar too get it while it's hot I mean cold"}
{"text":"Came here last minute and got some rolled ice cream and bulgogi sub. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and so sweet! The sandwhich was really good, you will love it if you like marinAted meat

Surprisingly this is also the first time I had tried rolled ice cream, pretty cool watching them make the ice cream and it tasted even better !! I would definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I ordered two trays of sandwich for my son's softball league and it was good for almost 10 kids and adults. We all loved fresh sandwiches!  Also their brownie and guava smoothie are literally the bomb!!"}
{"text":"I was checking a place with free wifi and smoothie and I like this new place that I found 

Staffs was friendly and store was very clean and spacious
I think I'll come back here often as i spend lots of time with my laptop for work"}
{"text":"We stopped by yesterday and got some rolled ice cream. I ordered chocolate and it was so fresh and delicious! They make it fresh and in front of you. The owner also gave me a sample of cookies n cream rolled ice cream and that was also delicious. Nice workers- nice service- delicious ice cream! I will come back and try a sandwich sometime."}
{"text":"Formerly a Port of Subs, Fresh Sub is now a family-run sandwich shop with the same fresh-cut meats and cheeses. I've popped in for a quick grab and go a couple of times, and the sandwiches are tasty and more importantly, MASSIVE. Not that I'm complaining, but I'd love to see the ruler they're using for the \"six inch\" 'cause I swear mine was closer to 9! The guy I always see behind the counter always has a smile on his face and offers samples of the newest menu additions. 

The Smoky Bros is my go-to with smoked cheddar and a two meats, similar to a club. They also offer hot sandwiches and a variety of wraps for low-carbers- I heard they're still perfecting their lettuce wraps though, which is what I'm really holding out for. Check back in soon, they're adding rolled ice cream to the menu.

TIP: Use the Yelp app to order through Eat24 if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Fresh sub is definitely a place to go. Although I live across the street I never took notice of it until now. I'm so pleased with the overall experience. Customer service was excellent and the presentation of the food was marvolous. This place has a very generous owner, and I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything is fresh, tasty, amd delectable! It originally was a port of subs and we were pleasantly surprised to find this establishment. It is our familys new favorite sub shop! Extremely courteous, kind, helpful and just a bright amd cheerful place! The bread is so light your dont feel guilty for eating it. Now you MUST try the rolling ice cream!! So scrumptious and flavorful. Freshest fruit and smoothies! They do cater. I will be a customer as long as they are open. :) Thank you Fresh Subs!!!

{"text":"Stopped by yesterday when I was picking up my buddy who worked across the street .. amazing sub and an amazing owner ! Talked for an hour about marketing and stuff everyone should check this place out it's fabulous and great prices too !!"}
{"text":"The best sub I have ever had. The delivery was on time, professional. I would definitely order from fresh subs again. Thank you for awesome meal."}
{"text":"Just had the best sub. Korean BBQ Beef sandwich and guava ice tea. Super delicious place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Owner is extremely friendly. Sandwiches taste fresh. Korean barbecue sandwich was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh ingredients and big portions. Staff is super friendly and quick. Can't beat it if your in the mood for a sub in this area."}
{"text":"It used to be a Port of Subs. The menu is similar and so is the sandwich prep counter.

They also feature smoothies, coffee, and now rolling ice cream.

Friendly staff.

I recommend it."}
{"text":"Just indulged in a great sandwich and smoothie for the first time here. Have to say I enjoyed it very much. The sandwich was made on soft fresh bread with smoked ham and sharp cheddar I can really taste. All the fixings were very complimentary to the whole sandwich. Filled me right up! Felt like it was a lot like port of subs which is also one of my favorites. The smoothie I got was very tart and I really enjoyed washing it all down with it. Best thing is they deliver. I'm going to be exploring the menu to say the least."}
{"text":"I got this postmated so my review is limited to the sandwich. 

I got a footlong \"Fresh Italian Sub\" for $10.99. It was filled plentifully with fresh ingredients. THIS is what a sandwich should taste like. The bread was notably a lot more soft and fluffy than most sandwich shops I go to. The slices of meat and cheese were pretty thick. There definitely was a generous amount of veggies. The sauce was just heavenly. Not overpowering or too much though, which is important."}
{"text":"Great Korean sub. You will not be disappointed!!! It is seriously better than any phillycheese steak."}
{"text":"Great subs, much better than your typical chain sub shops.  Very friendly and curtious.  Loved every sub so far...has become my new goto spot when i want a sub.  Compare to port of subs if you are looking for something close in the chain world.  Also, check out the rolled ice cream!"}
{"text":"Slightly better than Subway but of course that's not saying much..On the exspensive side for what  you get"}
{"text":"Just got this place for the first time, very delicious and fresh. Recommend the Italian"}
{"text":"Very good sammy (sandwich)! It was sooooo big & looked picture perfect. Min was extremely friendly & built my sandwich to perfection. He gave the customer that \"little extra\" that you would wish all places would, but seldom do!"}
{"text":"I was next door a few weeks ago running some errands when a very sweet gentlemen came by and gave me a sample of a mango refresher ! It was delicious! Today Im back in the same area and decided to pop in to try some menu items! I got a Mocha Frap (my usual) and it was to die for! Better then Starbucks!! My daughter got to try rolled ice cream for the first time and it is so fresh and healthy! He makes it right in front of you and his customer service is amazing!! He checks back up on you to see how everything is and appreciates your business! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent costumer service , looking forward to go back and try more subs"}
{"text":"They have the entire package! Greta sandwiches, icecream, smoothies, and staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super tasty fast and friendly place with board games to pass time with friends and they also offer rolled ice cream. Tucked in the corner of the plaza."}
{"text":"The owner is so nice!! My husband and I were so sad when we saw Port of Subs closed but this place is so yummy! I love all the small details the owner added to make it different than any other sub place (fresh bread, smoothies etc) We will definitely be back, especially to try the rolled ice cream!!"}
{"text":"So this used to be my go to Port of Subs location since it's close to work but it was turned into a new sandwich shop with new name. I decided to give the new location a try, and was pleasantly surprised. The sandwiches are still very much the same and still have deli cut meats. The service was good and very friendly (the man looked to be the owner, even gave me a sample of their rolled ice cream free!) I had the Italian and it was just like any Italian sandwich should be, and they still carry my mayo/mustard favorite mix! Needless to say I will still frequent this shop for my lunch time sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered from BiteSquad and though delivery time went from 33 minutes to nearly an hour-I'm not going to blame it on this new biz.
It happens.
Ordered two subs-the Italian and the Smokey-both were great with all the fixings and tasty bread.
Far above Subways quality (unless you LIKE pre sliced sitting there for hours meat and cheese)...I'm a Jersey Mike Fan first and of the two chains Port of Subs reigns supreme-its always about where I am when I choose and it's good to know I now have a third option that's come to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very happy with our meal. Soft bread and tasty filling. Will order from them again. Very friendly staff and like they have more than soda's for drinks"}
{"text":"Didnt't know this place existed. The place was empty. We walked in, the Asian guy took our order. We ordered a couple sandwiches & a couple smoothies. He started making our food, BUT this older Caucasion walks in--Clearly he's been here before. He ordered. What happened next irritated me. The Asian guy asks if he could make his order first. R U SERIOUS?? He actually PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIS ORDER & SERVE THIS GUY FIRST. So New customers: A women with 2 children are MADE TO WAIT. WOOOW!!! 
Sandwiches were bland & barely had meat or veggies. For price, shoulda gone to Jimmy Johns! 
WONT - BE - BACK... SMFH"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first and I have to say the subs here are great. Got the itialian and you can tell that the bread is baked fresh, the veggies are fresh and the meat is good quality. You can't really beat the price also. This is way better than subway or any of the other chain sandwich shops. Also, the staff here is so friendly and attentive. Will come here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really clean. Reasonably priced. Sandwiches were great. A variety of selections i have never seen before. Like the Korean Bbq sub. I had the roast beef and Turkey with provolone. Outstanding. I'd pick this place over subway or port a subs any day of the week. They also have rolled ice cream!"}
{"text":"Wow this was yummy! I got two subs #1 Korean BBQ, it was so good! I wish I would have gotten two! The 2nd was the Italian also very good! The man helping me (about 3:30 on sun the 23rd) was so nice, he greeted me with the most friendly smile and helped me choose the Korean BBQ, thank you! I also got a smoothie and it is so refreshing on such a deadly hot day!:) I didn't try the brownie yet but it's very soft .. I'll definitely be back! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Good sandwhiches.Nice employees/owner. Quick and easy. Prefer Fresh Sub over subway or other chain."}
{"text":"Soooooo good
Better than subway
Better taste better service
And roll ice cream is fantastic"}
{"text":"Doing laundry next door... HOT day in Vegas walked over to grab a smoothie. Strawberry Mango PRETTY TASTEY"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing! I had the Korean bbq sandwich and it was amazing. Brings me joy seeing a father and son running a business together. Also their rewards system is very fair."}
{"text":"Great place , amazing food ..... much much much better than Subway or so.... 
also extremely fast delivery service  up to 15 miles from the restaurant !"}
{"text":"The bread is fresh and soft. The service is excellent and friendly!!!!  My sub was so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in and immediately Min greeted ud with a Friendly smile!

First time coming into this shop and it was pretty clean and the menu was pretty easy to understand.  

Min was great in making our subs and took his time to make sure he did them right.  We loved the food (and the roll up ice cream) and the service.  Will defiantly come again."}
{"text":"Wow! What great sandwiches. We had the Popular Club and Fresh Italian. The meat was sliced when ordered and they are generous in the amount.  They also have smoothies and ice cream. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"The first thing that stood out was the guy working in the store. He was super nice and very customer oriented. This is huge for me as I could love the food at a place but if the service is bad I won't come back. He slices the meat infront of you and you can tell all the toppings are fresh. I guess that explains the name. Lol. They also have rolled ice cream! This made my day. It's tucked back in the strip mall and you can't see it from the street but trust me it's a great place for a quick sandwich and ice cream."}
{"text":"Came back again,again just the best sandwhich shop in town.  Take a look at this sandwhich"}
{"text":"Good service, good subs, I had the Italian 12 inch and could barely finish it. 

He gave us free sample of ice cream super good.

Thanks. We will return"}
{"text":"Great subs and smoothies, and our kids LOVE the rolled ice cream. Min is the sweetest man, too."}
{"text":"Glad I happened to notice this little place. It's tucked in the corner  but I was pleasantly surprised to find it. All sorts of fresh options...subs with fresh cut meats, veggies that were clearly wrapped to keep fresh, homemade sides, treats, drinks, smoothies, fresh brewed flavored teas, and to top it off, a rolled ice cream station in front? It looked very clean and maintained and service was very friendly and welcoming. Decent pricing and close to home, I really liked it I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I came into this place with my 2 friends. The owner is very nice and friendly. The restaurant is nice and clean with a screen t.v and music playing in the back ground. We ordered the Italian sandwich on white bread. The bread tasted very good I know it was homemade bread when I tasted. I also tired the macaroni salad it was also very delicious. We ordered the ice cream rolled and it didn't disappoint us at all. Overall everything was very spectacular. I will definitely return to this restaurant and try out other menu items that this place offer."}
{"text":"I don't live near here and came in while waiting for my DMV appointment. Got a 6inch sub, smoothie and rolled strawberry ice cream. The sandwich was fresh and loaded with thick sliced turkey. The rolled ice cream was fresh and my son loved it. Biggest reason for the 5 stars is the great customer service by the owner!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas to see my nephews and found a flier for this great little shop at our airbnb. The rolled icecream grabbed our attention! The owner was super charming and gracious as he handmade icecream in the spot for each of our group with his anti-griddle setup. Watching the icecream being crafted in front of us was such a fun experience. The chocolate was outstanding and the cookies and cream was so lovely and the texture is so perfect. Lucky find!"}
{"text":"Very polite great service and basically replaced port of subs for a better vibe.  So they do subs, smoothies, & ice cream. This is a great location as well i found it as i was driving by and I'm glad i stopped.  They have a-lot of different varieties which is great!  My man put me on to artichoke now im winnin!   Favorite sandwich gotta be the 'Fresh Sub Club'. 

5  's"}
{"text":"I'm a long time loyal customer of Port of Subs and when Fresh Sub took over i was skeptical. Needless to say they have delicious subs and they have an added touch! There smoothies are a must try. You can taste the fruit and they have a perfect balance of flavor! If you're looking for a delicious healthy meal this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Subs are decent i like the bread it is nice and light. Service is friendly and prices are good."}
{"text":"Happy to come across this wonderful establishment. From the minute my cousin and I walked it, we were welcomed with a smile. The employees went out of their way to explain our options to include items I wouldn't expect to see.. can you say ROLLED ICECREAM... yum!! We proceeded to get our subs, with freshly shaved deli meat and it was delicious! We ordered refreshers that were just that REFRESHING! The owner made it a point to come out and greet us first hand, offer us coupons to use in the future and personally make us rolled ice cream (green tea!!) thank you Min for your hospitality and wonderful food! We look forward to returning very soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is named appropriately.  No pre-packaged meat sliced!! This stuff is sliced to order including the cheese!!!  So fresh and delicious!!! The bread is soft and airy!! Oh don't forget the fixins !!! Veggies are fresh and crisp!!! You can ask for more lettuce or onions and no dirty looks!!!  The staff is over accommodating, smiley and courteous!!! I thought I was back in time!!! A new favorite sandwich stop!!! They also give punch cards for free stuff!"}
{"text":"The owners are wonderful. Great customer service and good fresh subs. They have cold brew coffee and rolled ice cream. It has a little bit of everything to fix your hunger needs. Always a big friendly smiles. Perfect for lunch and when you need a pick me up coffee n ice cream treat."}
{"text":"My go to place for sandwich always seems to get better. Now they have pizza sandwich. Love it. Owner always gets it right."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious, and the service is great. I had the Korean bbq sandwich. It was very flavorful. Another thing I liked about it was the fact they made everything fresh, including the boba in the smoothies and tea. Thy their rolled ice cream. It is excellent."}
{"text":"Got the rolled ice cream and mocha frappe...He makes it fresh and tastes delicious. He came over during to make sure everything was ok..great place and very friendly"}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic sandwich, an absolutely delicious tea, and fabulous rolled ice cream for a great lunch. Not only was the food great, but so was the service. The owner is a fantastic man who genuinely enjoys running his shop and the other service was very friendly as well. It has a positive atmosphere and a clean environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were handed a decent sized sample of their rolled ice cream. Totally won us on that one instantly. Their bread tastes so fresh and is delicious and fluffy. All of their ingredients were fresh and they carve the meat right before it goes on your sandwich! Definitely will be stopping back in very soon!"}
{"text":"Fun fact: Fresh Sub has Boba! It's delicious. The Thai Tea is a favorite for when I'm doing laundry and need a treat. On a warm day the rolled ice cream is great for cooling down. My family loves this place as the service is always warm, kind and with a smile."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sub place in vegas. not only is the food great! but the service is top notch! you feel like family with the owner. every time we go he is so nice to me and my whole family."}
{"text":"Better than subway !!! Food is all fresh & fruits are all fresh, sweet, & juicy . Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We were looking for something tasty, fresh and this place delivered! We got the Italian sandwich with prosciutto instead of ham, and the Korean BBQ sandwich. We also got the guava and the mango smoothies. Everything tastes so good! Definitely a comeback place."}
{"text":"I had this for lunch yesterday and the sandwich tasted off but I thought nothing of it. A few hours later and I got a sudden wave of nausea, I tried to fight it but ended up throwing up more than 10 times over the course of the night. Once my body purged all it could I felt back to normal, which is how I know it was caused by food poisoning. I will never consider ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Very good. Min is very kind. He always does the best service. I always come here for Korean coffee. It\"s really good. If you want a new dish, try Texas Fisco Pie. Also I love the Korean BBQ sandwiches. Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered some subs, since we just moved into the area. We were very impressed with the customer service we received, and the quality of the food. We ordered two subs and they were fresh and delicious. Definitely will recommend to anyone looking for something fresh and really good. Plus, they have a variety of smoothies and salads too! We will definitely be returning to try out something different from their menu. We ordered the Steamy Brooklyn and Popular Club. Go check them out! They are reasonably priced and the quality is great!"}
{"text":"Great place to go eat, better than port of subs, and they also have rolled ice cream. The owner is great too. I eat here every day during my lunch break, very good place."}
{"text":"Love their versatile menu my boyfriend ordered a bread pizza and a chicken teriyaki sub with a brownie and I ordered a ice coffee with fresh boba and a KBBQ spinach wrap with cheddar soup. Price was fair and kbbq was on point. This is my second time going here but my first time eating here since it's so close to home it most likely won't be my last. Dining area is clean and they have fun board games on the side if your bored."}
{"text":"I was craving a good sub and decided to yelp a sub place near my house. Fresh sub was very close and had great ratings so I decided to check it out. I thought it would be pretty dead due to being Labor Day but it was still busy inside! I ordered the \"popular sub\" (ham turkey provologne) and ordered the Italian sub for my husband. I was surprised to see that all the meats and cheese were freshly sliced.  The subs were very appealing to the eyes as well as the taste!! Bread was soft and not dry. Veggies were fresh. Meats were tasty and not too salty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have found my favorite sub shop of all time. First off, the service is something like I've never seen. The owner/manager/cook/server is an awesome guy and I wish the best for his business. Second, oh yea it's fresh. The meats, the veggies, the smoothies, the rolled ice cream, it's all very very fresh.  Last of all, it's super clean. All the meats and veggies are always rapped and he always wears a new clove after everything. A great place like this should have a line out front, it's just the best and I hope more people will find it because it's a rare gem that should be enjoyed by everyone."}
{"text":"the owner himself serves you with his own caring hands. the place is meticulously clean and such amazing attention to detail. the vegetables are so precisly cut and organized in the containers and nothing touches anything else. the meat and cheese is such high quality and sliced fresh on fresh made bread. a 6 inch sandwich here is equivalent to a 12 inch sub across the street for considerably less money. you have to stop on and see that I'm right."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and wanted a smoothie.  Got a strawberry bomb, real fruit was a good surprise.  Checked in on Yelp and got a free sample rolled ice cream cookies and cream, first time to get this and it was gooooood...  will come back to try the rest of the menu definitely.  And the owner and employees, are friendly to boot."}
