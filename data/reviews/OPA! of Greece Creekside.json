{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for a single order. The food was okay but I was glad I was not in a rush."}
{"text":"I had a serious calamari craving and was in the area. Should have gone elsewhere. I don't mind eating the tentacles, they're kind of good. But ONLY tentacles, that's not nice. I could pay the 9.00 in a restaurant and get a whole heaping plate of calamari rings, which is what I'll do next time."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Its the closest place to dine for us and we go occasionally.  The staff are usually friendly and the food is standard opa fare."}
{"text":"Worst OPA EVER!!! And I have been to A LOT of them.

The owner, boss, manager- whoever the guy running the front end was- is a nice enough guy, but the food was not up to par with the other franchises; and that ain't sayin' much!

The \"Greek\" salad consisted of these gigantic chunks of mostly tomatoes and cucumbers and when I say gigantic, think a quarter of a very large tomato.  I know what a greek salad is supposed to look like, my bestie is Greek.  There was very little seasoning and barely any salt, a tiny sprinkling of sub-par feta and one measly olive!  

The special sauce is plopped on top of your plate, wasn't even offered a little side container, other places do.

The worst part.  The chicken.  Looked like chicken.  Smelled like chicken. Well, it didn't taste like chicken, the texture was far from chicken and was so tough, chewy and stringy, I couldn't eat it...it was so bad that my husband couldn't eat it and he'll eat just about anything.  

Then the icing on the cake, my husband asks the owner if they had any tooth picks to get the strands of chicken cartilage out of his teeth...ya, my husband is a totally classy guy...the owner one up's him and says, \"use your fork!\"

NUFF SAID."}
{"text":"Decent food, really friendly staff.  I go here a few times a year for the convenience and haven't been disappointed with the food, haven't been blown away either.  It's good."}
