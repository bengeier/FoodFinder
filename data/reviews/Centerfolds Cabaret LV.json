{"text":"Do not go here!!  Total scam artists, hustlers and thieves!!  I had thousands of dollars as long as a watch stolen. Yeah I was buzzed out, but who isn't??  They will take you for everything you have plus more!!  They drained 2000$ from my bank account plus another 1000$ after I had left."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most unappreciated gentlemen's clubs in Las Vegas. The variety of quality women that it offers is more than any other place in Las Vegas. The perfect balance of class  quality, and intimacy"}
{"text":"Went last night, the staff n ladies were awesome, they picked us up n dropped us off in a limo at no charge."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this club, most girls aren't too friendly and overall the bouncers are a lot more money hungry than other clubs in the area. Cheap drinks for locals $6 but why pay that when they are free at the Deja VU."}
{"text":"Worst strip club. They will try to rip you off with everything. The girls are thieves."}
{"text":"We were planning on having a good time, but every time a bouncer got in the way. It seem like the bouncer's were more money hungry than the dancers were. & they charge more than rhino for a V.I.P"}
{"text":"You like assigned seating, super creepy staff, very pushy girls, and ridiculous prices? Then THIS is the club for you. 2 drink minimum to get in, that's $36. You want another drink? Gotta buy two more, another $36. 15 mins in VIP for a couple they told us $100 plus we'd have to buy two more over priced drinks. Well it's $115 (plus tip) and you have to buy the dancer a drink so that's $65 for three drinks (don't ask me why) and they make you tip again for the absurdly priced WATERED DOWN drinks, then when she's done dancing, which, while it would've been nice, she wouldn't shut up about dragging us to the back room for $600 the whole time rather than just letting us enjoy what we paid for. And THEN of course another tip for the dancer. But not only that, sleazy management kept bringing us papers to fill out, during the overpriced dance, interrupting what we were TRYING to enjoy...So ridiculous....DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR MONEY AT THIS SLEAZY PLACE! It would be cheaper to hire a beautiful escort and have her dance for you privately for an hour in your hotel room."}
{"text":"Nice looking club with nice looking girls. They of course offer to pick you up in a limo and have a good selection for bottle service. I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Came here for my cousins bachelor party.  Great service  with Andrew !  He really hooked it up. Beautiful girls.  Good liquor.  Will definitely be back!  Thank you Andrew. You are the man!"}
{"text":"They checked my ID when I entered and found out that I was a Vegas local so they comped me 2 free drinks. Entry was $36 though, but with the comp drinks, I thought it wasn't too bad. I was used to the strip clubs where you would tip the dancers on stage for dances, but not a lot of people were doing that. I thought this was etiquette, but one of the dancers told me that they normally make the majority of their money from dances. The girl that showed me attention in the beginning was Valentina, and ended up hanging out with me for the rest of the night. She was a nice flirty girl, Hispanic, and her company was enjoyable. The girls were more on the THICC side, I did not see a lot of petite girls. I am not sure if the prices of dances are the same for other girls, but she was charging me $20 each dance.   CON: I decided to buy VIP from her and she told me upfront that it would be $150. Once she moved me to where the dances would take place, she tells me that I would have to buy two drinks (one for her and one for me) which would cost an extra $50. I wish she told me this before-hand but I guess this is how they get you."}
{"text":"Most of the girls are absolutely amazing beautiful and great personalities and the hosts are very pleasant as well. But the management is absolutely ridiculous not to mention that my car was sideswiped while in Valet! There were no cameras around and the Valet acted clueless!"}
{"text":"Great club. Hot girls, real drinks, and you will actually be treated like VIP here. Stay away from the Cuban girls, they are really pushy but other then that it's a really classy club."}
{"text":"I was approached by a gentleman on freemont. Jason very nice guy gave me a card to call the driver. My girlfriend and I called and got picked up at our hotel. There were two other guys in the shuttle. They were very nice as well. I was in shorts and t shirt girlfriend sweat pants and t shirt both gentleman in the shuttle tshirt and jeans. We got to the club the door man pointed to me my girlfriend and one gentleman we could come in. The other one was told he could not come in. We all ask why they said dress code even though he was better dressed than me. He was black the three that were permitted to enter were white. None of us entered because we felt this was wrong the driver took us back to the hotel. I have heard of the prejudice places but first time witnessed it this establishment should be ashamed.  Zero stars."}
{"text":"The worst club, I have ever been too. I was jn the middle of the song and I have took 25 second of dance and than song just change and stripper said song changed you have to pay 20$ more for one more dance. I mean it's not worth it.!!! I just hate this club"}
{"text":"I love this establishment from the classy woman to the variety in music. If you want good drinks, great dances, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"The other night my friends and I were at Hard Rock.We decided to check out the strip club  across the street. I had been there a long time ago but didn't care for the staff etc but they changed the name so we checked it out. After talking with the host, we were told the club recently had many changes and they seem to be trying to take good care of the customers. They also opened a kitchen. We did had a spicy chicken and a pork dish. Both were very good. Prices weren't too bad. The girl and the customers count was also much higher than I remembered. It was pretty busy & a few of the girls were friendly before trying to get into your wallet. We wound up having a pretty decent time and they had several hot girls in there."}

The VIP host ( if I am not mistaken his name is Brent) gave us a truly VIP service. The girls were not pushy and they let us enjoy our night. I cannot wait to come back."}
