{"text":"Waited almost two hours for delivery on a Sunday night for an undercooked calzone paired with cold marinara sauce (must have just come out of the refrigerator). If you're going to take two hours, I expect good food."}
{"text":"We placed a delivery order at Nick's last night for the first and last time. After a two-hour delivery wait our greasy and undercooked calzone arrived along with an equally greasy and soggy pizza.   The calzone was pallid doughy inside like ET's skin. On the outside, the crust was crispy brown to burnt black spots. The cheesy filling was a clumpy string of a mess, dotted with a piece of sausage or two.  The calzone was uneatable and quickly found its way to our trash. (I was even afraid to give it to the dogs, fearing a complaint for animal abuse lodged with the humane society.)   The pizza was only slightly better, in that we were able to actually choke down a few slices. It was soggy to the point where it had melded together with the cardboard box that disguised its appearance.    It is a wonder either of those \"treats\" ever made the box. Any respectable employee of this place never would have let product like that  leave the store in the condition it was in. It truly was disgusting. I only wish I could give this mess of a place zero stars.  The way I look at it, Nick's owes me $42 plus tip for the waste of a meal brought to my door."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster."}
{"text":"I'm not completely convinced yet.  I ordered for the first time tonight. I got a build your own slice of pizza and a Cesar salad.  While the ingredients were great on my pizza the crust was a bit soggy. They also forgot the ricotta that I ordered $.35 to add on my slice.  The sauce was meh... but not the worst I have ever had.  The salad's dressing tasted cheap and they added tomatoes (which was odd because it was a cesar salad).  The portion size was alright there was a fair amount of Parmesan and the croutons were good.  This place is new so there are probably some hiccups still.  It was an alright experience but I am willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Not only was my pizza delicious and my beer cold, but I had a great conversation with the owner. I found out they use fresh ingredients and even make their own sauce (a delicious sauce I might add). As I was leaving, she asked if I had ever had their ranch on my pizza. After I told her no she insisted I take some with me for free (normally 0.50). It was definitely amazing, and again, home made.   My favorite part is that they offer a variety of beers as well as hard liquor. So if you're looking for a fun place to hang out with friends, get a little tipsy, and don't like the loud and boisterous atmosphere of mill, this is the place to go.  If I could recommend one thing it would be an investment in an arcade game. I would literally spend so many quarters and hours on that."}
{"text":"This new pizza place is where Devil's Pizza Factory used to be. Receipts still say Devil's Pizza Factory on them in fact.  Unlike Devil's that made varying shades of bad to decent pizza for $6 a pie, this place makes bad pizza for $10-$13 a pie.  I ordered one of the 'special pizzas' and found that the dough was not particularly good and it really just tasted like salt. It also filled a napkin with grease that we dabbed off.  The in store service was very nice, but the pizza was not good enough to try again."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from here and both were pleasant experiences.   Also, the fact that they have halal pepperoni is a HUGE plus.  First time I ordered was a halal pepperoni pizza.  The crust was good and ingredients were good quality.  My only complaints are that the pizza was extremely salty (though I'm blaming that on the pepperoni) and my god were they heavy with the oregano.    Second time I ordered a calzone with chicken, peppers, and onions (on the suggestion of an employee as they were out of the halal pepperoni).  It was delicious!  Again, way overboard with the oregano but delicious nonetheless.    I'd order from here again, but in the future I'll ask them to skip the oregano because then it's pretty much perfect."}
{"text":"Just had a NIGHTMARE grub hub experience with another company. I waited 2 1/2 hours for disgusting food. Finally my food arrived and it's soggy and monstrous at nicest. I cancel it then look back on grub hub and find Nicks. Not only was it delivered on time (early actually) BUT it was also delivered by the nicest guy and it was delicious. Bookmarked for future delivery! Thank you so much for saving my night!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and sister whilst vacationing, after a 13 hour drive, our first stop was nicks pizzeria and boy were we hungry! We were greeted by a tall young man who seriously made our day. He was quite personable and recommended some great options. He even welcomed our few changes of extra garlic and cilantro on our pizza!   We tried: Philly cheesesteak- pretty good! Meatball sub- amaze-balls! Homemade meatballs!! White pie pizza- GET THE HOMEMADE BUTTERMILK RANCH!  A cute girl brought us our food and made our margaritas! I think I even saw her flipping the pizzas! Nicks need to give her a raise! All in all- great place, very personable!   UPDATE! OMG! YOU MUST TRY A SLICE (or two) OF THE HOMEMADE CHEESECAKE! seriously the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Was mediocre food. Ordered a personal pan pizza and an order of their Alfredo for delivery. Wasn't given any plastic utensils so was forced to go down to my hotel lobby in search of some. The Alfredo was not bad and came with a piece of garlic bread that was so drenched in garlic butter it was inedible. Pizza was eh, it seemed as if someone dusted it multiple times with oregano it was so overpowering. All in all it was an OK place, but nothing stood out for me. Not sure if I would call em up for delivery again."}
{"text":"They called within 24 hours apologizing and tried to make it right. This goes a looong way for me. It was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Was actually on my way to Buffalo Wild Wings nearby, but plans with some other people that I was gonna meet up with fell through, but I was starving and needed some place to go..... Nicks caught my eye and I figured I'd give it a try since I'd never been there before.   Got a very welcoming greeting from the staff right when I walked in, and didn't mind taking the time to talk with me a little extra while I was deciding on what to get and while I was waiting.   Ended up just getting a pepperoni calzone. and while I will say it was a little on the greasy side.... I just couldn't put it down once I started, and I enjoyed every bite of it.  Definitely gonna go there again whenever I'm back around at the north end of campus!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered a delivery for 3 sandwiches to my workplace with some co-workers. The delivery driver was over an hour late because he wasn't local and apparently didn't understand how to operate a GPS or why that might be relevant to his job description. Consequently, everything was room temperature and soggy. Additionally, apparently either this joint has some kind of avant garde art school sandwich shit going on, or everyone was too occupied with taking gigantic bong rips in the walk-in fridge, because all of the sandwiches lacked a top piece of bread. I have to admit, begrudgingly, that the ingredients in the sandwich itself were pretty good, but that doesn't really make up for the rest of this nonsense.  In short, I hope Nick's Pizza either shapes up fast, or suffers from a structure-leveling grease fire."}
{"text":"Amazing place, soo many options but the award winning Philly cheese steak & homemade pizza are off the charts!! Definitely recommend to try them out. The food has so much flavour! Great in store environment; a homey mom and pop store that keeps my heart and stomach happy :)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza and I love supporting local small business too. the company is great and stopping for a beer and a slice. I love checking out a game and having a great meal too."}
{"text":"Usually have slices available in the afternoons. I really love their pizza and the family that owns the place is a reason to come back. If you're not feeling a slice or there aren't any available then try their Philly Cheesesteak. I frequent this place almost weekly and the cheesesteak is huge, flavorful and cooked perfectly. They also have a great selection of sodas from Jones and other smaller outfits. Beer on tap too with happy hour and game day specials."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering and I was hoping for better... guess not. I get a call that the delivery guy is at my apartment and no one is answering and the phone number was incorrect. So I confirmed info with the lady at the store and she said everything is correct and she would call the driver. 20 minutes go by and the driver still isn't here... so I call again. The lady on the phone said he was in the apartment complex and should be there soon. 10 more minutes go by. He finally walks up and says he dialed a number that was a digit off.... so I'm assuming the address was wrong too. The driver acted like it was my fault that he went to the wrong address and had the wrong number. I called the store to complain and because I ordered off Eat24 they couldn't do ANYTHING. I have sent an email to Eat24, but good luck if you have horrible service. My fries were soggy, jalape√±o poppers and Mac and cheese bites were cold.   Hopefully the delivery guy gets better, but we won't know since we won't order here again."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and Meatballs... So very good!   Ton of excellent flavor, tons of sauce and amazing meatballs.    Will definitely be making this a lunchtime regular.  Only complaint (but easily fixable), the place seemed to be a bit of a mess with delivery bags, and car signs and random stock laying out on counters and around the store.  Organization is everything when someone walks in...  Put that away and it would be much more welcoming:)"}
{"text":"I actually signed up for an yelp account so that I can tell people about this place. The pizza was greasy and not freshly made. I used napkins to soak up all the oil. They did not have any pizza slices ready for customers, this is difficult to understand as this is supposed to be a pizzeria. They told me that they were making me fresh pizza, but all they did was reheat old leftovers. If the owners don't know what they're doing they should reconsider being in business."}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza and natural mini chicken spring roll.  Spring Rolls - 3/5 - Nothing special. Pizza - 2/5 -  Greasy. Tasted okay. I've def had worse, but this is far from great. Value - 2/5 - 25$ for the above and a drink. Not very worth it.  Overall, I am glad they delivered, but I won't be trying them again."}
{"text":"Was cruzin' around in tempe, saw this place cuz its not a big chain and gave it a try. Damn that some good pizza! I will be comin again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I like the pizza and the sandwhiches. I got to say my favorite one is the margarita pizza with homemade meatballs. My favorite sandwich is the Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"I am currently at store. It's been an hr for a pickup of two pizzas. Only two people are working. One on register one making pizzas. When u have $2 pizzas you expect this to be a busy time. Why only one person? It is only $6 total with 2 pizzas and tax. But holy cow be aware you'll be busy. And this has nothing to do with the food because I haven't even touched it yet."}
{"text":"OK slices and beer specials.  Nice decor, great staff."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was delicious!  Just one block from the Light Rail and totally worth it!  We came in at 8:30 on a weeknight and they still had slices available.  We both had pepperoni and it was good, not too greasy and not too doughy.  The best part was their homemade ranch.  WOWZA it is good!  We had never tried ranch on pizza before and at their suggestion we did.  You will not be disappointed.  I can't believe I missed out on this wonderful flavor combination all these years.  This restaurant is a great place for a quick bite after a comedy show at the Tempe Improv, which is in the same building.  The woman working there Rosie is a sweetheart and gave us tips on what to try next.  She recommended the alfredo....they even have shrimp alfredo which my husband will love.  We're coming back Sunday for more yummies.  This is a nice, local, family business and we are glad we have found them.  Show them some love!"}
{"text":"Yet another new solid pizza place in Tempe that delivers to me. The \"personal\" pizza we had was like nearly 12 inches (we were expecting more like 8\"), and a lot of bang for the buck. The cheesesteak we split was delicious. We also ordered some cheese bread, and it was pretty unique compared to what I'm used to. Also very good. The pizza was really flavorful and good, and we could tell the ingredients were all fresh.   Everything we had was great, and it arrived fast. The customer service here was super nice as well. I don't like using the word \"cheap\" when describing something that was both inexpensive and good, but really - the prices here are low for what you get. Great bargain. This location used to be a different pizza place, but after sitting empty for months, I'm glad to see a new tenant int he space. I'm double glad that the food worths.    When I first moved to this neighborhood a few years ago, there was only a handful of pizza places that delivered to me besides the Hut and Dom. Now there's a dozen or so local places offering pizza delivery... and a few dozen more offering all types of different cuisine. I love choices. If you're like me, you like to support local restaurants like this one. Do it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were hanging out last night and decided to order pizza. I had him jump on GrubHub and decide where we would try next. He chose Nick's NY Pizzeria which neither of us had tried before. We placed an order for the Nick's 5 Pizza which included pepperoni, sausage, meatball, bacon, ham, and garlic. It was AMAZING!!! Both of us took a bite and then stared at each other in amazement of how great it tasted. After that we ate in silence for a while. That is how you know it is good! The ingredients were fresh, the pizza was a decent size, the tomato sauce was perfect. I want to try other menu items in the future but I am in love with this pizza so we will see what happens."}
{"text":"I'd love to review the food but, it's been almost three hours since I ordered it and still nothing. They did offer a free drink once I called to ask about my order. At some point though, a free soda is not worth waiting this long for food."}
