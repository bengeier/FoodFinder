{"text":"This place is a favourite.  Classic, delicious, and fresh food.  You get what you pay for and the portions are as big as the taste at this retro little country joint.  Best souvlaki and burgers and the sweetest folks running the place - Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I live near this place so have had to eat here on occasion as there aren't a lot of options nearby.  I usually have the chicken souvlaki on a pita, banquet burger, fries or onion rings.  The food is decent but nothing to write home about. The prices are fairly high. They have no specials so a burger, fries and pop will cost you about $12. And don't share into the kitchen while they're cooking. They don't wash their hands and will go on to read a newspaper, wipe their brow, etc. In between handling food. I've seen this with my own eyes."}
{"text":"I have been going to Country Stop since I was a kid and the same 2 old greek guys are still working the grill. Its your basic greasy spoon with greek offerings. I usually get the gyro and a vanilla milkshake and occasionally the breakfast. All are good. The seating is old and held together with duct tape but thats what adds to the charm. The prices are getting up there but kudos to them for staying in business so long. The fresh cut fries are good too. What can I say Im a fan perhaps largely based on nostalgia but a fan none the less. Try the retro love meter palm reader if its plugged in. That thing has been there for 30 years."}
{"text":"Lunch on Friday and this was our destination. Although busy our order was completed in a short time. Just as good as I remembered 20 years ago when they were the only take out joint in town. 19.99 for lunch for two but the burgers and portions were enormous and we couldn't finish it all. Nice to visit the place again. Great staff....."}
{"text":"Friendly family business.  Food is always pretty decent.  Gyro is good, breakfast is always good, peameal on kaiser great, burgers are OK, could be tastier...pretty much a frozen burger.  If they stepped this area up and made fresh chuck home made burgers this place would be epic.   Still beats the hell out of fast food restaurants and supports small business!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today as I was in the area. It seems to be family run and is located in an area where there are not really any other restaurants around. I ordered a chicken pita with a Greek salad and a drink. The chicken pita was good I liked the sauce and the chicken was tasty. The salad was OK more lettuce than anything else. I would have preferred more feta and I should have asked for my dressing on the side. It was pretty clean. The bathrooms were OK. The price shocked me though. I paid 16 dollars for this meal in a run of the mill burger joint. Meh. Its just a typical burger place but I guess the location is what keeps it going."}
