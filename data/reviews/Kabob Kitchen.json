{"text":"I finally gave this place a try. So glad I did. The food was excellent. The portions are large. The lamb Kabob was the best I've ever had. A great find. Hope they have much success."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff! I'm a big fan of Mediterranean! And this place is the spot for the authentic taste."}
{"text":"Awesome place for kabobs and gyros! Staff is super nice too. I'm confuse why it's listed as $$$$ on here because salads are like $8 and not expensive at all. Definitely try this place out for homemade delicious food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! So happy to finally have good takeout in the neighborhood- probably the BEST babaganoush I've ever had! The shami Kabob was so flavorful and the potatoes you get as a side were so good I wished I asked fo an extra side of them. The gyro meet was also one the best I've had- nice thick cuts full of flavor & you can actually taste that they use lamb not like some of the others out there. This is definitely my new go to place for good Mediterranean takeout."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they've opened and have always left with a happy stomach! Their beef kabob is AMAZING! Their jalapeño chutney is so good! The workers are always friendly and helpful even when it's obviously super busy. The wait can be a bit long, but it seems they're a little understaffed. I'm sure they will work all the kinks out! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just got back from this place, so I wanted to write a review as soon as possible, because it was terrific!  My wife and I were looking for a kabob spot for lunch today and Yelp, once again, came through! This place popped up as a hot and new place, and since it's so close to us, we decided to try it. I have to be honest with myself though, being from LA, and having a plethora of Middle-Eastern options, I wasn't optimistic at ALL about this place, but I'm glad my wife was steadfast with her decision to come!  My wife got the #16 - Gyro Platter, but substituted fries and bread for all salad. I went with the #29 Combo Kabob, where you can pick three kabobs ($3 more for lamb or filet mignon). I chose the chicken thighs, ground chicken and beef kabob. I also asked for my side to be all salad, rather than rice (sorry for the crappy pic, there was a shadow cast on my plate cause of where I was sitting, and I was too lazy to move over, lol).   The chicken thighs were by far my favorite. If you like chicken thighs, you'll love their chicken thigh kabobs! The salad was also great, especially because the dressing it comes with was so unique. David (the owner/chef), called it a chutney, but the flavors reminded me of Persian-style-torshi (think, pickled veggies), that's been turned into a salad dressing. Amazing! They were out of their Shami kabob, which I equate to koobideh, so I can't wait to go back and try that out.  David was super nice and welcoming, and Stacey who was front of the house, was very friendly and prompt. Great service!  I'm super ecstatic that this place is so good and so close! WIN!  Food: 5 Ambience: 5 Service: 5 Value: 5"}
{"text":"Amazing! Ignore the photos posted this place is legit good. Some background...the hubs is Persian and we eat Persian food very often, kabob is a weekly thing. We've tried a ton of places. We ordered the gyro plate with salad and did the 3 kabob sample entree so we could try everything. The Shami was sold out so next time for that choice. We picked chicken thigh, ground chicken and beef (should have done lamb but always wait to see quality of the meat before picking that). The chicken thigh was the best I've had ever, cooked perfect and juicy, highly recommend. They serve the plates with a green chutney (torshi) that is crave worthy and I wanted to buy a separate tub of it, must try! This shopping center doesn't get a lot of foot traffic so let's keep this placing going strong."}
{"text":"Have had take out several times always ready within the time they say. Food has always been taste and good presentations nice."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is one of my all time favorites and we have a lot of places here in town that serve it.  Most are just average but the Kabob Kitchen is one of those gems that you are lucky to find when you take a chance.  I tried the chicken Kabob and Gyro salad.  Both were excellent and the price is so low that I worry about them being able to stay in business.  The food is way better than the price would indicate.  Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Kabob kitchen is delicous! It's a fast casual spot located on Cheyenne and Hualapai. My grandma and I went in on a Friday evening around 6pm and it was empty. Order at the counter and a friendly employee will bring the food to your table.   I ordered the gyro platter which comes with salad and fries. Grandma ordered the lamb kabobs with salad, a side of fries and a drink. Total for everything was around $32. The food is cooked to order so it did take some time for everything to come out.   The gyro meat was very good. It is a mix of beef and lamb with all the right spices. The pieces were nice and thick. The tzatziki sauce on the side was tasty, but I wish there were more of it. Grandma's lamb kabob was delicious. It came with a side of chimichurri that I would have drank if no one was looking. The fries were just fries but they give you a decent portion. I look forward to coming back here again real soon."}
{"text":"Great service and incredibly delicious food is something you can get at Kabob kitchen. Their service is wonderful and great selection of meats and salads. Will see you soon."}
{"text":"This place was good. I love Greek food so I had to try it. I was pleased with the food and the staff was friendly. I will come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a number of dishes hoping they'd be good. Kabob House knocked it out-of-the-park!  Their baba ganoush is among the best I've ever tasted. The humus superb. Chicken, lamb, rice, roasted tomato, everything ... de-lish!  We'll go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma & it was really good! The tzatziki sauce was delicious. Our food arrived in a timely manner even though they were short handed"}
{"text":"best greek food in las vegas by far.had takeout and today ate in.had the gyro wrap with fry's $7.00 what a deal!! really nice inside seating. best gyro ever had.take out we tryed just about everything.falafel best in town.chicken and beef kabob will knock your socks off.dulma and salads unbelivable. even down to their bread it's the best.we will be regulars here.if you want fantastic mediterranean food this is the best in las vegas!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today. The food was AMAZING! The menu is easy to maneuver and they have so many options. Everything was fresh and delicious.  For starters, we ordered the hummus. It comes with pita bread, but we ordered extra because we were both eating it. The hummus was great and the pita bread was also really good - and tasted extremely fresh.  I ordered the gyro wrap. It was very good, but the meat was a tad spicy. The price point was great for all the food you receive.  My fiancé ordered the chicken kabob plate. It came with a side of hummus (which was delish!), pita bread, rice and of course the chicken. The chicken was flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So glad I chose this place. Excellent in everything they do and serve. Had a wonderful waitress/cashier. Best hummus I have had in a long time. Lamb kabob was out if this world. And portions are so generous and I got such service. Going back and never been so full it was so good!"}
{"text":"Big portions, great tasting food, and fast/friendly service. The babaganoush was very tasty, and so was the beef kabob and ground chicken kabob. They even gave us a sample of their potato and green bean stew, which was delicious. The kabob plate came with a grilled tomato as well. I will definitely go here again. We need more places like this in the northwest area."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday to order some takeouts.  Walk in, go to the counter and order, then pick your seat if you're dining in.  I asked the lady at the counter when this place was opened, she said a month ago. The menu is on the wall but if you need a little time, you can also grab one of the menus from the counter.  She told me 20 mins for the order. While I waited, I noticed the place was brightly lit with nice paintings on the wall. There are 7 tables and 2 booths.  I ordered Bulgarian Kabobs $14 and it came with a small side of salad, 2 small pita bread, rice and a potato dish similar to curry. The kabobs were tasty and well seasoned.  I also liked their Sambosa $4.95, two deep fried wrap with potatoes, ground beef, peas etc.  It was a tab bit more pricey than my other favorite place but I am happy this place is much closer to where I am."}
{"text":"We got the combination player and a gyro salad. Both were very good. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Good food.  Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"So glad I found this in my neighborhood, Great Food! Great Service! Highly Recommend.. especially the Dolma."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Excellent customer service from all the staff. Their food is fresh and authentic with large portions to fill your appetite on a modest budget. My family and I are loyal customers, eating both in and grabbing food to go. Support this place Summerlin needs more great spots like this!"}
{"text":"Average kabobs. I wish they wouldn't add soo much rice and instead add more of something else. The one great thing they have here is the baba ganoush . It is amazing! Best baba ganoush I've ever had hands down. If they spruce up their kabob plate then this place will be great."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh the only down side is the very long wait since only one person cooks. Always call ahead to order."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality and quantity for the money.  Had the gyro wrap and it didn't disappoint.  I'm not a fan of lettuce on gyros but it was okay here.  Prices very reasonable, should show under $20 instead of $60 as currently on Yelp."}
{"text":"This new place just opened and its a must try, you won't be disappointed and like us, you will leave satisfied, it's soooo good, but come hungry, HUGE portions here, which we didn't expect considering the small prices, the gyro wrap was awesome, hot and delicious, yogurt sauce and the vegetables inside were fresh, crunchy and amazing, I love that all their pitas are served with a generous side of hot crunchy french fries! for me, fries can make or break a place, these fries are perfect! My friend had the chicken wrap and it was also freakin delicious, cooked perfectly, tender and grilled to perfection also with crispy fresh veggies inside and delicious sauce. This place was so good I have come back three times, tonight I had a basic falafel wrap with fries, and it was anything but basic. huge balls of falafel,  so good, a great vegetarian option. I'm coming back next week for the kabobs. They have a really great menu with a ton of options. The prices are unbelievably right on, an amazing value considering the quality, flavor, and portions! The restaurant itself has a super casual warm, inviting fast food feel, but nice and comfortable enough to stay and sit dow to eat. Also, I wanted to to say how nice the people working here are, they all have a very chill vibe, this is definitely my new favorite Mediterranean Grill, and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo happy to have a Mediterranean restaurant in the in the neighborhood! The salmon plate is super yummy, but there is a ton of rice. The baba ganoush was delicious! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is super good. They have great falafel, sambosa, and their lamb is cooked perfectly, very tender.  Overall a great Mediterranean spot.   Service has been good when I have gone here too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here three times already (they opened just a few weeks ago ). The place isn't perfect, BUT they try hard and ALL new businesses gave kinks to work out.  The food is delicious. I feel like the chef takes pride in cooking the meats well. I love their basmati rice. The hummus and babaganoush are really tasty.  As a local privately owned business trying to establish themselves I think it's important to be supportive and patient. I hope they will be around a long time as we don't have good Greek food in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Clean, modern restaurant with: so many appetizers, salads, soups, and entree's to choose from! Gyro wrap and hummus side was a great choice for late lunch!"}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to order my food.  The person who answered was very pleasant and said it would take 20min.  I ordered the Shami & Chicken Kabob, Combination Platter and an order of Baklava.   When I arrived, there were about three tables occupied.  The place looked very clean and welcoming.  The girl at the counter already knew who I was and called me by my name.  She was again very pleasant and made conversation with me while charging my card.  I thanked her for her service and expressed how happy I was to have Mediterranean food so close to my home.   On my drive back home I kept getting a delicious smell from the food and I just couldn't wait to get there.  I got home, I opened up the boxes and that delicious smell hit me.  Oh boy!!! Everything looked nicely/neatly placed.  I grabbed a piece of bread and dipped it in the hummus.  My goodness!!  It was very creamy and flavorful.  I've had Mediterranean food before but first time for my hubby.  He was in his office and said that it smelled very good.  So I made him and I a plate and enjoyed our dinner together.  The chicken and shami kabobs were very moist and full of flavor.  I mean everything tasted wonderfully.  Both I and my hubby were very pleased    I will surely keep coming back.  The service and food was amazing!    Thank you for opening a place here in summerlin!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best falafel I've had! I hate when falafel is dry, but here it is moist and flavorful. And the girl working at the front the two times I've gone is so cool and sweet."}
{"text":"Just had an amazingly delicious gyros at this place.  Stopped there on the recommendation of someone and gosh, were they right.  Super clean, really reasonable and the food was absolutely delicious!  So glad I found this close local, and lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"I just want everyone and anyone that has a chance to stop here to do so. First time there and it was amazing!!     Celeste was the wonderful girl and very knowledgeable girl that took our order. We were very impressed! Will definitely be back soon! And most importantly my wife was happy so us guys can't go wrong taking the girls there.thanks again for the great service!"}
{"text":"Such a great food, finally! a good Mediterranean place on this side of town! Kabobs are full of flavor and staff was very nice and thankful for my business. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Ordered the 2-Kabob Combo with chicken and lamb ($3 up charge but well worth it).  They don't have garlic sauce but instead make this wonderful chutney style sauce from parsley, cilantro and jalapeño.  OMG!  Delicious!  The quality of the meats and salad are first rate.  We also ordered a side of their homemade hummus and babaganoush -- excellent and even yummier with their chutney.  Support this wonderful new addition to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars. First off the food was very good! The service on the other hand was not good and borderline rude. There is a lady that works in the front maybe in her 30's. Very dry unwelcoming attitude. For starters she didn't know what a few items were on the menu, I can handle that. Second off, she picks up her cellphone and starts texting in the middle of my transaction. The menu states with an entree it includes rice OR salad and bread. I read the menu wrong, my fault. I asked her \"does this come with a salad?\" She says .. \"um, i guess I'll get you one.\" She didn't answer my question, and gave me some serious attitude. I went back online to discover I actually read it wrong. I would have been more satisfied not receiving the free salad, and being told politely I read it wrong. Ha! The first time I went in the owner served me my food, made the food, and was an absolute delight! Very nice man!! I usually try to support local small business over chains. Customer service goes a long way, it's hard to go back in there and spend my money when I was left feeling like walking in and ordering food was a real inconvenience! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Loved the falafel, which has three huge, soft chickpeas inside. Great pita bread. Next time, will ask for extra tomatoes and tahini. The basmati rice is really fluffy and of high quality. Kabobs are decent.  Hummus is great.  Big negative is the service. Very slow to serve the food for dine in and take out. Better to order ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"It has such rave reviews here I was excited and I decided to give it a try. It seemed fairly close to Summerlin since it's right off the 215, score! I was so excited...it was very promising. The kids love gyros to that's what they had. We ordered the combination platter. I ordered the filet kabobs. The menu says it comes with salad or rice...I ordered on the phone...she told me it came with both and a stew or something like that...they should word their menu to reflect that...the girl that answered the phone was very nice. When I arrived she was super pleasant and the food was ready. She was excited for me to try the restaurants food, she said that she moved here and loves their food. So again, very promising. She was so very friendly. I read that some people had bad service, I had really great service...very nice. The kids said they liked their gyros. The steak kebabs were ok. They were sliced thin rather than a chunk of steak like other places. I found the rice to lack the flavor of other Mediterranean places. I tried that stew she mentioned and it was absolutely gross. It had an indian flavor to it...it was in the wrong restaurant-it seriously belonged at an Indian buffet. I'm just not a huge fan of Indian food. The hummus was ok. I will say the falafel was delicious! It wasn't dry, it was really good. I don't think I'd come here again. There are just too many other great Mediterranean places to eat at. I really wanted to like it. I really did."}
{"text":"The services wasn't bad, but the cashier didn't know the menu well and kept having to go ask someone in the back about every item we ordered. Once we got the food I wasn't impressed with much. The rice and chicken kabobs were good, but the fries were not very good. The wraps we ordered were ok. This place has potential, but they need to improve their customer service and add some more flavor to some of the dishes."}
{"text":"Yum!! I'm so happy this place is here! Really good food & service. I ordered the Combination Platter for $12 & baklava for $3 and it was totally worth it. Plenty of food & it was delicious. Call & order ahead of time if you don't want to wait. Seems this place is going to be busy since it's really good!"}
