{"text":"Great Service!!! We stopped in during lunch around 3pm treated like kings and queens!"}
{"text":"Nice little place, great bar food and the bartenders can actually make a drink correctly. Ordered everything from a 3 wise men with a frozen rum runner to chicken wings and beer, never disappointed."}
{"text":"Almost always great service sometimes the kitchen runs slow but it's always good. Friendly enough environment to bring the kids for lunch or dinner. Staff is always welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is a joke without Danny at the bar.  Clientelle are whiny and suck unless they are controlled.  If she isnt there, no other barmaids can handle anything abd would prefer to just kick people out."}
{"text":"I like coming here for a good burger & beer & it's a nice place to bring my kids & family to eat. It's a cozy little bar & grill & just recently added a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I'm already in love. The wings are excellent and the Happy Hour menu is the best I've seen in a while. This is the perfect place to go if you want to get some friends together and watch a game. They have great game day specials! Try the buffalo ranch wings. 10x better than BWW. I just read a review about their ID policy. They are very strict so make sure you have a state issued ID or driver's license."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! Definitely a dive bar, but that's never a bad thing! Everyone was very welcoming from the moment my boyfriend and I walked through the door. The atmosphere was so lively, I loved it. We decided to check out the patio area since it was a nice day. We were seated right away and the manager even came to greet us. I'm sure she had an inkling that it was our first time there so she went ahead and bought us a round of drinks on the house, which was super nice of her.

Happy Hour runs M-F 3p-7p and Sat 11a-5p, and I think all day Sunday, but don't quote me on that as I'm not sure. We got there just in time for happy hour and found that their wings are only 45 cents everyday after 5p and all day Sunday! I guess I know where I'll be spending Sunday Funday. We ordered some wings, hot buffalo garlic, garlic parmesan, and caribbean jerk. Finger licking good. The wings were actually a decent size and the flavors were just right. We also ordered quesadillas and some waffle fries with cheese. So yummy and good portions! We decided to stick to bottled beers and the prices were very cheap, another plus.

Service was awesome! Everyone was quite attentive and checked on us regularly, not just our server. They've got an A in my book for service that's for sure. After we were done eating, it did get a bit chilly and noticed that the outdoor fans were on. One of the employees was nice enough to turn them off when I mentioned I was getting bit cold.

I can't wait to come back here for more wings. We spoke to another customer and he suggested trying their burgers so I may just have to do that during my next visit."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the owner is just fantastic! Great service! This is a great local corner bar! Even the regulars are super friendly!

Food is wonderful and their wings are the best! They have a covered outdoor patio with heaters. It is more like a 3 season patio. 

And the best part, for me, is that there is designated motorcycle parking!"}
{"text":"First time here with my gf. Good food and good atmosphere definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off since the '90s. Always good food and spirits. Service is generally really good, and my last visit is no exception. Friday night NBA playoffs with the Cavs, get there early. We just went to go eat around 6:00 and they had two tables reserved for big parties. They seem to know how to pack in the crowds for the sports fan especially Indians and Cavs. I can't say enough about Characters, it's one of Parmas hidden gems."}
{"text":"Great dive/local bar. Standard bar food with some interesting additions. Pudding shots are awesome and cheap so try it, just know they won't induce a drunken stupor if that's what you're after that night. No judgement, just saying."}
{"text":"I love this place. Relaxed atmosphere, fun staff-Kelly the bartender is awesome, always remembers your favorite drink. Has many frequent customers so there`s a lot of intermingling at the bar.  Food is definitely a step above most sports bars, lots of specials. The soups-any of them-are fresh & delicious. Also love the mussels & the wings, and if mac and cheese is on special you have to get it-it is not nasty processed out of the box junk! Good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"It was okay. It seems like they have nice specials on food. Our drinks were reasonably priced and they had a good selection. The bar seemed like a bunch of regulars. My friends and I all thought the bartender was pretty rude. She literally ruffled through my credit cards to find my ID while I was asking her questions about what drafts they had. That really kind of made me mad. I could have handed her my ID had she simply asked, and there was no reason for her to rummage through my things like that, especially when she probably should have been paying attention to what questions I had. Didn't even order yet and she's sifting through my credit cards. When I told her I could have just handed her my ID had she asked, she laughed and said its okay. No, it's not. You're rude. There are plenty of other bars around here, won't be rushing back to this one. Not my type of place."}
{"text":"My favorite Parma dive! My friends & I always get a bucket drink. Great food for cheap!"}
{"text":"Perfect Parma dive bar. The have standard bar food but it's really good stuff. Good drinks. Good deals, wing night is every night. Really can't beat that. We live close by and enjoy going frequently!"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome you can tell they're fresh not the frozen pre-fried ones you get at most places around, burgers are great, went there with my family [6], waitress very attentive to us, bathroom was very clean & so was the eating area, went there for the *summer kickoff* it was real nice very organized, wasn't to crazy for the pulled pork but was palatable, overall or experience was great..."}
{"text":"Nice place to have some wings and beers.  Wings are $.49 every day after 5 PM. 
I also go there for the steak on Monday and Wednesdays  it's only $3.50

The drop your prices are about $.50 cheaper than any other bar in the area. 

They always have game day baseball basketball and football specials


The only drawback is it times late-night you get some really drunk people.  That are bothersome at times. 

Also another thing you should note is that the bar closes the food at midnight."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this bar doesn't accept a US passport as a valid form of identification and won't let anyone in the party drink if they are with someone who \"doesn't have ID.\""}
{"text":"I haven't been to Characters since I was around 21 years old. I remember their food being good and their happy hour specials. So I randomly stopped in recently with the wife to try some of their current food offerings.

As soon as we stepped in, we noticed cigarette smoke in the air, which I despise. It wasn't strong enough for me to leave though, but it did leave my clothes smelling bad. As I was sitting at the bar (the tables were all taken), my nasal passage and throat began to narrow due to the smoke. I started to get a slight sore throat while talking. This always happens when I am in a smoky atmosphere.

No one was smoking in the bar (because that is illegal in Ohio) and the outdoor patio (that is enclosed with a roof and walls) has one door leading directly into the bar.  Every time someone entered or exited the outdoor patio to smoke, the wind would blow and a fair amount of cigarette smoke filled air came with it. Second hand cigarette smoke is my #1 pet peeve in life as I grew up with a mother who smoked in the car, but not in the house. Plus, many aunts and uncles smoked, so I somehow learned to despise it. And I've never smoked myself.

For dinner, we ordered what I saw in an old yelp picture - buffalo chicken nachos. The picture showed a beautiful plate of nacho goodness with all the fixins.  I'll be honest, this is the reason I stopped in tonight - for the buffalo nachos that were pictured on yelp. When the buffalo chicken nachos were delivered, we receive a cup of buffalo chicken DIP and a plate of tortilla chips. I was thinking, 'WHERE ARE THE NACHOS?'. Total let down. Not what I expected. I guess the picture I saw was from November 2015.

The Buffalo chicken DIP was actually good! I'd definitely order it again. The bartenders were very friendly and the service was great. I also ordered a bowl of mushroom soup and it was tasty. The bartender told me that they sautee onions and mushrooms for the soup. I tasted the large, fresh mushrooms, but not the onions. The flavor of the soup tasted like Campbell's canned mushroom soup was used as the base. I eat Campbell's canned mushroom soup and I like it, but I wasn't expecting THIS mushroom soup to taste the same as Campbell's. I'd order it again though.

We also ordered some teriyaki and BBQ wings.  After waiting about 20 minutes for the wings, we decided to take them to go because the smoke was bothering me and I just wanted to leave. The wings were tasty, even after we took them home! So the food was good, overall, but unless they fix the issue with cigarette smoke entering the bar in the winter (I'm not saying this happens in the warmer months due to the outdoor tent they use in winter), I won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out on Friday after 3 years of living in Parma. We have been looking for a new hangout bar and this place is awesome. The food was delicious, the drinks were cheap and the atmosphere was laid back, typical Parma. Their wings are super good and are also 45 cents daily from 5 to 9 or something like that. My husband got a buffalo chicken sandwich and the bartender was really accommodating with some special requests. All of the food specials and the happy hour were really good deals and are basically everyday. I can't wait to start coming here as a regular!"}
{"text":"WOW, Characters has IMPRESSED!!

I went here with a buddy for a Cavs playoff game two weeks ago and damn was everything good!

During playoff games they run their wing special .45cents, they run their happy hour food menu, which includes burgers, quesadillas and such. And the beers were 2 dollar 22oz domestic!! The wings were fantastic as usual and my bill was cheap. 

Highly recommend!"}
