{"text":"La verdad muy mala experiencia  la comida dejo muy poco que desear la mesera con actitud y una forma muy grocera NO LO RECOMIENDO NI VOLVER√çA A VENIR"}
{"text":"They added so many new stuff on there menu !!! I'm addicted to this place !!! The food it just the best ..."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially if you're looking for birria tacos. Didn't see a salsa bar anywhere, and seating is outdoors. Carne asada was very bland. Al pastor was amazing, barbacoa also good."}
{"text":"Servicio de lo peor estuvimos sentados por 40minutos   y no nos llevaron ni agua.
No se lo recomiendo a nadie y todas las personas se estaban llendo por lo mismo falta de servicio"}
{"text":"I concur with Michael J. Found this place about a year ago and we are addicted. THERE IS NO PLACE BETTER FOR \"AL PASTOR\"! NONE. We have tried a few other things on the menu, and have not been disappointed. But frankly, thats what we go there for: Tacos al pastor.  We have even moved out of the area and come up with every excuse in the book to come back. It is well worth the hike if you are not close. Authentic. Rich. Flavorful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for authentic Mexican tacos in Phoenix. I love the pastor and carne asada here.  They have the cart out for pastor in the evenings, I try to make it on the weekends when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I only had tacos but here's my quick review:

Really great tacos... REALLY GREAT! The service was awesome (but they weren't busy) and the atmosphere very traditional for this part of town... I LOVE IT!

The menu is not overwhelming but lots to choose from.

The tacos came out piping hot, the CarneAsada  I had was extremely spicy, moist, and flavorful as was the Barbacoa... perfect.  I'll try the shrimp burrito next time, it looks delicious!

I hear on weekends they have a taco stand out front for faster service because they are extremely busy then.

Thanks to Joanna for the great smile and awesome service.

If you are in this part of town and want great tacos STOP here!"}
{"text":"I really like al pastor and after I saw the pics here for this place I knew I needed to give them a try. I've never been here so it was a little confusing walking in I didn't know how/where to order, so we just down and after a few minutes a lady came and asked us to move to another table saying that one was wobbly. Kind of annoying because I liked where we were but I think I was just hungry and being a bitch. Chips & salsa were given and we had our food within a few minutes. I ordered 2 tacos al pastor & hubby 1  lengua taco. They serve the tacos with a red sauce and I also requested a green. My pastor tacos were really good! The green sauce was spicy & delicious and complimented the taco so well. After tasting my food, I felt like I had just ate a snickers and turned back into the happy go lucky person I usually am! My hubby just kept mumbling \"it's good\" in regards to his taco & the salsas, I don't eat tongue so I can't speak on his food but he seemed to really enjoy. I Only gave 4 stars for 3 reasons:   1) confusing sitting/ordering process&being asked to move from my table 2) flys, it's annoying and gross 3) the carrots, radish seemed dried/old 
Bottom Line: I'll be coming back..  soon! 3 delicious tacos with chips and salsa for just under $5!! One of the best taco shops I've found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I disliked this place so much. To start off we got there and we were not greeted nicely. Next, it took about 30 minutes (not exaggerating) to get our tacos and there was not a single soul in the taqueria. And to top it off the tacos were not what I expected. The only taco I like was the taco dorado de birria and that's the reason for my two stars just cause of that taco. But service was well under one star. Never coming again."}
{"text":"Aweful service, when we arrived at least 5 out of 8 tables were empty but dirty, we had to wait 10 minutes to get someone ask \"do you want to seat here?\" duh!"}
{"text":"Waited and hour and a half for food and still didn't get our complete order. Our server was incompetent. We definitely won't be returning"}
{"text":"THE BEST pastor tacos anywhere!!!! Sliced, crispy, marinated meat between two soft corn tortillas. Yumm"}
{"text":"These were the smallest damn tacos I ever bought for 2 damn dollars never will I go back again"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST place for a street taco fix from carntias, tongue, carne asada, pollo etc... My kids love the salsa bar they can't get enough salsa."}
