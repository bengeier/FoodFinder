{"text":"Absolutely,positively, without a doubt the best pizza in the tri state area. 
Try everything but anchovies or just a plain old cheese and pepperoni, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"for the love of god help me.

this is the best pizza on earth.  
pepperoni mushroom  
if anyone can help me find a pizza similar to vincent's in nyc, los angeles or anywhere please message me.  

i need."}
{"text":"This is by far the absolute best pizza in Pgh, I grew up in the Forest Hills area but have since tried every other well known pizza place in Pgh and nothing compares to Vinnie Pie. NOTHING. The place was recently remodeled and is pretty nice now compared to the run down old place. The service and speediness of getting your order is lacking as usual, but the pizza is just plain awesome."}
{"text":"First, let me say, the pizza is some of the best I've ever had. Generous toppings, and a flavor that can only come from a well seasoned oven.

Then why one star? The service. Waiting 45 minutes just for drinks? Over an hour for the bill? It's madness. I have been many times, the pizza is just that good. But, last time I neared my limit. Rude staff who you can hear talking crap about the customers from the back room. Never once getting a beverage refill in over an hour. What the heck! 

It's a Pittsburgh legend for a reason. Good pizza. Nobody would dare say the same for the front of house staff. There is a competitor in turtle Creek that makes similar (but not quite as good) pizza. The service and management is light years better. Drive that extra mile, safe yourself a metric ton of frustration."}
{"text":"6 Stars, or 10.  This BY FAR the best pizza I have ever had anywhere.  I dream about this place and never fail to eat it when I'm in the Burgh.  It is ridiculous how good this place is."}
{"text":"I honestly can't explain the five star rating this place currently holds. It was enough to dupe me, so I can only hope that this review will help others avoid making the same mistake. Before I get to the pizza itself, let's talk about the establishment. The place smelled like a toilet. The bathroom itself smelled better than the dining room, and we would have considered taking our dinner in there if we thought it would have solved the problem. Unfortunately the pizza didn't salvage the experience. Sure there was a lot of it, and all description of its largess were accurate, but it was far from good and miles from the best in Pittsburgh, let alone the world/universe. Having a lot of a bad thing doesn't make it good. The sauce had almost no flavor and the cheese just fell off in clumps. If you want cheap cheesy pizza, you're better off going to Costco; it's not good pizza, but it's better than this.

I rarely regret eating  pizza, but my trip to Vincent's has left me wishing that I wouldn't have been duped by the crazy reviewers whose comments lured me there in the first place. Think twice; I wish I did."}
{"text":"I drive from Baltimore MD for this pizza ! That says it all.  I have been a life long fan of the Vinnie Pie . There is nothing like it in the world.  I was there recently and the place did not let me down again. Everything was great and the pizza was as good as it gets"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Pizza I have ever eaten.
It is so good, that for decades now when old friends who have moved out of town , come back for a visit, we routinely meet to share a Vinnie Pie as though it was a sacramental event."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday afternoon when I got the call that my parents were stopping over on their way home. And, \"Could we do dinner at your place?\" 

Having spent a large chunk of our day cleaning the basement, 2 tired, smelly individuals didn't feel like washing up to go out or like throwing together an impromptu meal for the 'rents. Not wanting to disappoint, we scrambled for a solution. Being Pittsburgh pizza veterans, but not yet having had the iconic \"Vinnie Pie,\" we decided to take leap and order from the newly remodeled original Pizza Park on Ardmore. We hoped that its reputation lived up to its legendary yet controversial status, as my parents are quite the connoisseurs of a hand-made pie. 

I called to order, and a cheerful sounding voice took my order for a large pepperoni quickly and said it would be 30 minutes. Thinking that a large wouldn't be enough for 4 people, as my dad can annihilate a large pizza himself in one sitting,  I called back a few minutes later to tack on another medium with sausage. Little did i know how that would turn out. 

 $30 worth of pizza and a delicious smelling car ride later, we knew we were in for an experience. I was all but crushed under the weight of the two pies in my lap in the passenger seat. No kidding. It took dedicated restraint not to immediately rip into the grease spotted, hot paper-covered cardboard slabs as we sped home. 

Upon dismantling, we realized that the amount we ordered was laughably ridiculous. It would have covered the republican electoral states on a playground-sized topography of  the Americas. It fully encompassed our good sized kitchen table and filled the house with a heavy, meaty perfume. 

Overstuffing ourselves to near sickness was a mission that instantly overtook us all. The only sounds ringing out for the next half hour would be the ripping of parchment and the chewing and tearing of four adults who had simultaneously lost their collective gastronomic willpower, and all respectable table manners. 

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes the Vinnie pie so special. I took to the pepperoni pie especially well, and can honestly admit that my memories of devouring it are almost embarrassingly hazy, a reaction usually saved for only the most pleasurable of culinary experiences. I presume that this dreamlike state is induced due to a combination of the following elements: The baguette-style, chewy crust, buried under a copious blanket of salty, succulent pepperoni and cheese with just the right amount of tangy, savory sauce. The grease factor is simply a delicious result of the unbelievably generous pepperoni-per-square-inch ratio that is unlike any we had ever experienced. The sheer amount of thick, chopped peperoni on each slice was enough to clog your proverbial arteries with just the smell alone. Impressive.

Exhausted and over-fully satisfied an hour later, it took longer to wrap the lavish leftovers than it took to gorge ourselves past full capacity. We later lived out a delicious, gluttonous work week of leftover Vinnie pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, after sending the parents home with over half of the excess bounty. 

Needless to say, we hope to return again for a dine-in experience at the Pizza Park, this time fully prepared after 3 days of fasting and at a time nowhere near swimsuit season.

From all of us Pittsburghers, your legacy lives on- thank you Vinnie, thank you."}
{"text":"I love Vincents Pizza ever since I first had it as a little kid. Now coming home for a visit at 27 and it still has the cheesy gooey delicious flavor that I have always remembered. So as far as the pizza I give great remarks. Yes it is expensive, but living in an area now where I pay just as much for a subpar pizza is ok with me!  The inside hasn't changed at all and the dining experience is pretty bad. I always call and get it to go, it will take about 45 min to an hour but at least you aren't sitting in the restaurant waiting for over an hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza in town, and a family favorite since the 50's.  So glad it's back, and better than ever!  I remember moving \"Back East\" with mom in 79 from San Fransisco, and this was our destination upon leaving the airport.  Great memories.

Used to be you would get 1 poorly made Pizza in 3 here, and bad service, but you stuck with it because it's just so unique, so good, and so full of nostalgia.  Now under new family operation, all 7 pizza's I have got from them have been perfect!  So so happy Vincent's is back, and just as good as back-in-the-day."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The people that work there are just plain rude. I guess I should've expected that knowing the restaurant is in Braddock

My bad review is not even worth the effort of typing it's that bad."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! Unfortunately the wait is at least an hour. Also the prices are quite steep. But great pizza!"}
{"text":"Having heard about this place (especially on WQED specials), I had to come to taste this pizza. It was worth it. It's got a thick crust on the edges but really thin the middle. The amount of cheese and toppings easily overwhelms the structural integrity of the bottom crust, but that's why you need to eat it on a plate with a knife and fork. The size of the pizza is generous and so are the toppings they put on it. The cheese tasted pretty fresh and there was lots of it. I really like how the pepperoni on our pizza was cut thickly. The overall taste of the pizza seemed fresh and special, not like from a chain or from any common pizza place. When dining in, they only have canned/bottled drinks, so no free refills, but the staff were really courteous and made sure we were doing fine. Very casual, cash only, pizza sold in whole pies only (no pizza-by-the-slice). Overall, worth a try for a different kind of pizza in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Too bad the pizza is good, because I would never set foot in here due to the servers and the general level of filth.  It's so poorly run, I'm surprised it's still open. It's a real disgrace to Vincent who devoted his life to making great pizza.  The servers are rude - cutting in front of a woman with a cane nearly knocking her over, slamming chairs into tables to get to seat people. Tables are dirty - we sat during dinner looking at five tables in our eyesight of uncleared tables - while folks sat and waited to be seated the whole time. Our server never brought menus and couldn't remember our order - one pizza two toppings.  Then when we brought our pizza home to reheat the next day, we found it was someone else's.  Gross!  It's the end of an era with Vincent's unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! So much better than the gross pizza chains..loads of toppings and big slices..other items on menu as well, if your looking for good pizza and service give em' a try.."}
{"text":"One of a kind Pittsburgh. Original pizza that has never disappointed. me an my wife have have made it regular stop round our anniversary"}
{"text":"Had Vincents for the first time today. It was amazing. Dining room was clean. I got mine to go. Flavor was good. Cheese was good. Crust was good. Pepperoni was amazing flavor and the amount. 4 stars because of the burnt flour and grease mixed under half the pizza...kind of made it unappealing but still tasted great!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. It's definitely greasy but so is any real pizza with lots of cheese and meat. A large is huge and will feed four or five. The crust and sauce are great. Just a good honest pizza.  It seems a bit pricey at $18 for a large, but it is a lot of food for the money."}
{"text":"Killing myself slowly has never been so delicious! I'm a cheesy-cheesy, sloppy pizza kind of girl, a la Mineo's, and the Vinnie pie is definitely one of the best! But beware...my husband and I (both hearty eaters) order a small and can still barely finish it!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of Vincent's is the pizza itself.  The waitstaff/bartenders are rude.  It is always a long wait to be seated...even when open tables are available.  The food takes forever to arrive.  The restaurant decor is outdated and dirty."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza but the service was actually awful. I don't regularly review places on yelp but I was fucking heated. Waited LITERALLY 2 HOURS for a pizza. People who got there an hour after we did were served first a party of 10 or so got there the same time as we did ate and left still no pizza. The waitress looked like she was going to cry the other one was bitching at us about our server. There's no music playing its bright as hell such an awkward atmosphere. I got up and asked someone from the front. They bought us a single beer to compensate that we weren't planning to order. And presumably lied to us about why our pie had taken so long and the other table got their pizza before we did. Any other pizza shop who had someone waiting for 2 hours in the restaurant would comp the pie. That's like simple customer service decency."}
{"text":"It had been 28 years since I lived in Forest Hills and last had Vincent's Pizza. On a recent trip back to PA, I happened to be driving by with my son and told him about how iconic Vincent's Pizza Park had always been. He asked if we could stop there for dinner, so we did. The pizza was outstanding and the highlight for us was the dough. We made the mistake of ordering a medium with double pepperoni. First off, the pizza's at Vincent's are much larger than I remembered -- a medium was way too big for two people. Secondly, they are VERY generous with their toppings so a double pepperoni was outrageous. Unfortunately we were travelling so we had to leave over half of the pie there.

The service was friendly and attentive, and the place was clean.

We'll definitely go back the next time we're in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"My wife threw me a surprise birthday party at this restaurant last week.  Our infant son has food allergies that didn't allow her to eat anything on the menu so she brought a small container of food from home so she could still celebrate with everyone else.  The waitress saw her eating the food and immediately became irate and was yelling at my wife that she could not have that food there because there is a health department rule - she was so loud many other patrons looked over to see what was going on. (I later called the health department and they said they have no such rule.)  Later the waitress was trying to pass pizza's to tables out of her reach and instead of giving them to one of us to put at the table, she rammed her way through.  We spoke with manager who did nothing to rectify the situation in any meaningful way.  Service was so bad that two employees who had nothing to do with the bad experience but saw what happened, offered sincere apology on behalf the the restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but we went a couple months ago and it wasnt good at all. The quality of the ingredients is very poor,  were ignored by our waitress and it is way over priced. We'll never go again."}
{"text":"Pizza is to die for.  Amazing flavor, be very patient, average wait is 40 minutes.  Be kind to your server, there are not enough and they work very hard."}
{"text":"This place should probably get a five because it's a \"Pizza Park,\" because Vincent, although I sadly never met the man, was undoubtedly one of the finest fellows to ever live, and also because the place is so refreshingly unpretentious, cheap, comfortable, and awesome.  The pizza is quite tasty.  The crust is superb.  There did seem to be a slight \"watery\" quality to the pizza that created some sogginess as time went on.  Still, a highly enjoyable pizza, and highly enjoyable place, and I deeply regret I never met Vincent.  Oh wow!"}
{"text":"You're stuffed but you start filling plate #3 anyway: Turkey, gravy, stuffing, gravy, potatoes, gravy, cranberries... Time to nap during the second game.

Vincent's excess has only one equal: Thanksgiving Thursday, 4pm. A large \"pie\" requires 4 to finish. Think Little Caeser's football field sized pizza with huge pepperoni chunks, probably a pound of cheese, and an outer crust edge alone equivalent to two loaves of bread. Salty as hell, cheesy as fuck, half-burnt and greasy enough to skip your 3,000 mile checkup; Vincent's is all things excess, nothing skimp, and nothing \"Artisan\". Just DELICIOUS.

The parlor is down to earth local charm, the slight working-class atmosphere showing it's edge. The staff push Heineken and Bud hard from tap and employ a motherly attitude calling you \"honey\" or \"sweetie.\" You'll find families looking to chat and it's likely their kids all play baseball together. No flannel or skinny jeans in sight.

Totally unique in the burgh, totally unique anywhere. Far outside downtown but you must visit once while in town. Twice might be excessive."}
{"text":"I grew up nearby Vinnie's and it was common to have a pie once or even twice a week when I was a kid. The oak leaves in the bar ceiling, flour all over Vinnie himself, the cigarette hanging out of his mouth, all were reasons some of my neighbors scoffed when offered some pizza from Vinnie's, but my family and circle of friends couldn't get enough.

One of the best things about that pie was the dough and crust. Vinnie baked the pies till the crust had a combination of lightly browned and slightly burnt surfaces, and the inside had a combination of air pockets and chewy dough that made eating the crust itself a meal to look forward to. It was like eating focaccia with great toppings on it.

While my family still makes a point of getting a pie at Vinnie's when we're in town, since Vinny passed away and the business has new ownership (some years back now) it has lost that subtlety in the crust that made it worth 5 stars, and I find myself disappointed when I get to the bready, dull outer crust that used to be the great finishing element of the pie."}
{"text":"I too have been going to Vincent's for 30 years and was very disappointed with my last visit. The restaurant opens at 4:00 we got there at 4:20. The place was already packed and was told it would be an hour wait, that's fine as I was waiting for the rest of my party to show. I had also ordered the pizza at that time. So an hour passes and the table behind starts complaining to the waitress that they were the first in the door and other people are getting their pizzas before them. She tried saying they had a lot of takeout orders when they opened. But people  were getting there pizzas before us who came in after us. l don't know if it was the waitress or the cooks but we ended up waiting 2 hours. The pizza is not the way I remember it there was a lot more toppings before and Vinny knew how to burn the crust just right but was still soft on the inside. Miss you Vinny"}
{"text":"Today's Post-Gazette reports that Vincent's on Ardmore Blvd is closed."}
{"text":"Vincent's Pizza is probably the best pizza you can get if you are a meat loving, pizza loving person.  You don't eat a pizza like this if you are overly concerned about grease or other things that taste good.  A pepperoni and sausage pizza is loaded with both and adds lots of flavor to the pizza.  Some may also prefer extra sauce.  If that's you, then ask for it.  You know it's a good pizza when you take the first piece and the grease from the toppings fills the void.  Again, not a place for the overly health-conscious but it really tastes good and is a nice treat once in a while.

Prices may appear to be high but portion sizes are huge.  You may just need to \"order down\" a size which should help the budget.

As others have said, this is a great Vinnie pie in a relatively clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza that ruins all others!

Heaps of fresh, real ingredients amount to a pie that's a challenge for even the hungriest to finish off.  A Vinnie Pie is the trophy for the winner of our family's fantasy football league - what could possibly be a better prize?"}
{"text":"Vinny's is legendary around my office due to it's gigantic pizzas and colossal toppings.  However, the allure of massive pizzas quickly wears off after one trip to the Pizza Park.  

The restaurant itself can easily be described as a dive.  Normally that's ok for me, I like dive places especially if they serve good food.  I dig the old school feel of the place however the restaurant smells like a dirty bathroom.  There's just a lingering odor there that it just plain gross.  

So how's the pizza?  In appearance you'll see that the cheese is piled high, the toppings even higher, and it's surrounded by huge helping of dough.  However you'll find a lake of grease surrounding the pizza, there's a TON of it.  The amount of grease is so immense that eating a slice gives me a huge headache.  Ditto on the amount of pepperoni.  Trying not to choke on handful of cheese and drown in grease while eating makes the experience far less enjoyable.  However they do get 2 stars because their dough is fantastic, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Horrible staff. Take my advice and go to Shelly pie in turtle Creek. You'll save a buck or two and the staff will actually appreciate your business. And as an added bonus they're actually open most of the time"}
{"text":"First time back since it re-opened. Place is cleaner and brighter than ever. The service was great. Pizza is the best traditional pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I did not have any of the other traditional Italian-American food, but people around me seemed to really like it."}
{"text":"I ordered 45 minutes ago, been here for 60 and haven't had a refill or seen the waitress since we sat.  Worst restaurant experience ever. Oh yeah water taste like garbage."}
{"text":"There really is no other pie like a \"Vinnie Pie\".  Cheesy, doughy deliciousness!  This is very close to our house, but we don't go very often - our arteries couldn't handle it!  We usually do take-out as the thick dough takes a while to cook.  We have eaten in, but our kids sometimes run out of patience.  The toppings are of good quality and they certainly don't skimp.  My personal favorite is the pepperoni and onion."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time on a Saturday night. Have heard how great the pizza was but had never made the trip from the North Hills to Forest Hills to try it. The pizza really was wonderful. Maybe the best I've ever had. Toppings were overly generous, fresh, and really tasty. They only serve pizza and tossed salad, so don't go there hoping for anything else. 

Now...the downside...We sat at a table and it took an hour and a half for our pizza to arrive at our table. It wasn't just us, many others waited that long. The staff seemed very unorganized. They couldn't keep track of orders and seemed to be in a fog most of the time. I observed people kneading dough, then going to the cash register handling filthy money, then back to prepping food. I observed handling of uncooked sausage with bare hands and didn't notice any hand washing going on. 

This is all too bad, because the pizza was so good. However...it wasn't worth waiting THAT long for and seeing bad food prep was a turnoff. I'll stick with our local pizza shops In Bellevue. Good pizza, variety of menu, and great service."}
{"text":"What a crazy place.

As all the reviews suggest, these things are crazy huge and greasy.

Go there for lunch with a bunch of coworkers, bond, and then be tired for the rest of the day.

I went with 10 guys, and we finished 3 pizza's.  We were complimented by other tables for finishing it all."}
{"text":"Vincent's is the standard by which I judge other pizza. No one in the pizza world  can equal that irregular shape, air bubbles, humongous toppings scattered about without care of symmetry, or that wonderful mixture -  dare I say nectar? -  of sauce and juice that runs off of the pie and onto the pan, creating tasty dipping pool for your crust. An \"everything but\" is a thing of beauty.

\"Ah, sweet mystery of life at last I found you!\""}
{"text":"Oh man, I can't believe this place isn't on Yelp yet.  There aren't enough good things to be said: this place defines Pittsburgh pizza, and remains the best I've ever had.  That's after living in both Chicago and New York--I order a Vinnie pie every time I'm visiting the Burgh.

Vincent himself is a big, burly, old-school pizza-joint guy.  There was usually a cigarette dangling from his lips while he tossed the dough, but that makes for character--growing up, there was always a dumb but entertaining rumor that the oven-blackened flour on the bottom of each pizza was ash from the cigarettes.  They've had the same location for years, just between East Pittsburgh and Forest Hills.  I think Vincent retired, but they still do things the same: enormous pizzas (if a bit expensive, but again, they're enormous) with cheese piled on top of a thick, slightly doughy (but in a good way) crust.  The toppings are piled on even more thickly, especially the pepperoni (my favorite) which comes in meaty chunks instead of thin, round slices.  

As soon as you get home and tear through the paper wrapper -- only the bottom half of the box here -- you're in for something awesome.  Lots of people come here to eat in-house too, where the dark walls give it a cool, slightly seedy feeling similar to a pool hall.  For some reason there's been a proliferation of other pizza places trying to steal some of Vincent's good name, but those places (PNC Park in particular) suck.  Be sure you only go to this one.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh and have had pizza from many places.  Vincent's makes a decent enough pie but I find the pie overly greasy.  I know the toppings are to blame but I have had many pies that haven't had this much grease.
  Otherwise the restraint is a hole in the wall but clean enough."}
{"text":"I started going to Vinnie's when I was in college at PItt in the 60's.  I always remembered it as the best pizza I ever had in my young life.  A few years ago, I went back to see it it was still as good. I am happy to report that Vinnie still has the best pizza I have ever had.  The best part is that the toppings are almost overwhelming.  My wife likes veggie pizzas and I like meaty ones. We split a half spinach/half pepperoni and sausage pizza. There was so much meat, I felt like I'd fallen into a Man vs Food episode.  The people who go there are like my relatives in W/PA.   They make it memorable, like the wedding scene from the Deer Hunter.  This isn't some yuppie, Neapolitan, truffle oil infused, arugula and chicken mole monstrosity conjured up by  someone pretending to make pizza.  The crust is great, the sauce is good. The beer is cold.  This is what you came for.  Oh, be prepared to take out what you can't eat.  Unless you are Adam Richman, you won't finish it."}
{"text":"When you tell people you're visiting Pittsburgh they always recommend the place with the fries in the sandwich. 

Why Pittsburgh? Why do you think so badly of yourself? There are so many better places to eat.

Vincent's (or Vinnie's) is one of them.

Yeah they sell subs, pepperoni rolls and other assorted fare, but let's be real. If you aren't ordering a pie here, you're the type of person that goes to a Burgatory and asks what the chicken menu looks like.

The pizza is the main draw, and it is huge. The crust is large and unruly. The cheese is piled on, the toppings are piled on. The grease that remained could have made a meal all its' own. 

This is not a hands only meal. 

At one point in time as me and my four diners stared down the remnants of our Pepperoni/Sausage pizza we realized we had come proud and would be leaving humbled.

Did it take awhile to get the Pizza, yes. Does the pizza have the same circumference of a school bus tire and everyone in the place is ordering a large, yes. 
How long does that take to cook people? You do the math.

Try it out, expect a food coma."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I had a pizza from Vinnies and our friends and I were not disappointed.  Quality and taste has not changed. A large bubbly crust slightly charred and a heavy cheesy pie teeming with condiments was as tasty as ever.  Our only complaint was the service.  I called in for this pizza to go and my wife went in to pick it up .  There was no one at the counter and she kept calling for someone's attention .  It took almost 10 minutes for someone to come from the back room and give my wife a pizza that was sitting on the shelf.  If Vincent's wants to gain back the business they lost to Shelly Pie during remodeling this better be an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Although I live in California, when I go back to Pittsburgh this is absolutely required eating.  I've been to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  This is absolutely the best pizza ever!  If you are accustomed to Pizza Hut or Domino's with canned toppings then move on.  If you want your pizza to give you heart failure, then this is for you!  I think you actually hear your arteries clogging when you eat this pizza.  But it's definitely worth it because it's so damn good!  RIP Vincent Chianese and long live the Vinny Pie!"}
{"text":"Well, the pizza is really great. Delicious, greasy, huge and leftovers taste great the next day. This location gets 3 stars because the service and pricing are a little ridiculous. The hostess was nowhere to be found while 5 parties waited to be seated for about 15 min. Waitress never refilled drinks. Also there was an hour wait for the pizza to come after we ordered! Price wise, it's a little wrong. $4 per topping on a large pizza is just plain overpriced."}
{"text":"I dislike writing reviews like this, I really do. I will not, however, shy away from what I see as my duty as a dedicated Yelper to give my opinion simply because a restaurant has been around a long time and is beloved by some of the local population. This pizza is not to my liking. The crust was overly doughy and tasteless. There was not enough sauce and way, way too many toppings and cheese. We ordered a large pie with half black olives and mushrooms, half green olives and roasted red pepper. The amount of olives, mushrooms and peppers on the pizza was simply overkill...more is not better, and they don't get that. If they were bothering to really look at what they were sending out of the kitchen here, they would see that loading a pizza with an overabundance of toppings creates pools of liquid that are unappetizing; the dough gets drenched and soggy and nothing crisps up and caramelizes. The cheese was barely melted and hardened as we ate it...again, there was just too much of it. Some people may be pleased and gratified by what they perceive as the abbondanza of this pizza, that luxurious sense of abundance that comes from getting just a bit more than one needs. They've gone beyond that into the ridiculous here, and have created a product that is not well balanced, not tasty, just not good."}
{"text":"You either love it or you don't. I haven't met anyone that doesn't. Each pizza is like a fingerprint; no two are alike. The dough is amazing!! I think the sauce is good-I get too wrapped up in the cheese and dough to notice. (Maybe next time I'll order extra sauce.)
They have eat in or carry out. You can not order ahead to eat in. Cash and carry.
Weird traffic pattern to get there...but, certainly worth it!!!"}
{"text":"While drinking in a brewery in Braddock, I pulled up my Yelp app and realized that Vincent's Pizza Park, a Pittsburgh icon, was only 2 miles away.  I wasn't particularly hungry but I knew by the time I got home I would be and I'd be regretting not stopping by.  So I did.

I've heard stories and seen pictures of the infamous Vinnie Pie so I was excited to see what all the fuss was about.  The dining room wasn't anything special but I was there for take out.  I ordered up a medium (I panicked and thought the small wouldn't be enough to have leftovers), half plain and half pepperoni.  I was told it would take 25 minutes but I wasn't waiting more than 20 despite the steady flow of customers who had called ahead.  I sat in the corner and peered into the kitchen, witnessing the toss the dough in the air as it was prepped for the ovens.  I watched as pies slid in the oven, rotated around and were pulled out of the ovens.  Pizza making has been mastered at Vincent's.

I was handed my order in what I like to call the \"Vinnie package.\"  My pie placed on a cardboard tray then wrapped in butcher paper and stapled at the edges.  It smelled delicious.  Once home, I unwrapped the Vinnie Pie.  Each pie that comes out of that kitchen is like a snowflake, unique in its own shape.  The bottom of the pie will inevitably have some of that black from the oven, just enough to add a little smokey taste.  There's a lot to like about a Vinnie Pie - a lot of crust (that's crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside), a lot of cheese (so much that it seems to sink towards the center), a lot of grease (that you may find absorbed into the crust).  If you're looking to eat healthy, this is not the place.  

That very first bite can be difficult to handle.  Some say you need utensils but I dared to use my hands to tame the grease soaked dough and gooey cheese.  Two slices were about all I could handle until I admitted defeat.  I should have just gone with the small pie.  

I noticed that many of the reviews are years old but the heart of Vincent's seems to live on.  My one star deduction is only because it felt a little pricey even after a few drinks.  But if you're looking for a pizza that's outside the box, a Vinnie Pie will satisfy."}
{"text":"The pizza in Pittsburgh seems to rely on grease as a main ingredient, which is the case here. Way too greasy. Not enough tomato or cheese flavor. 

Good Pizza has a nice thin crust, with just the right blend of mozzarella, tomato sauce and seasoning. Grease should NEVER be part of the experience. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friend loves this pizza so I decided to give it another go. The bottom of the pizza was black and there was almost no sauce. The crust was huge and accounted for half of the pizza. However, they do give very adequate amounts of toppings."}
{"text":"I consider myself well rounded when it comes to pizza, and I have to say that when I walked into this place last Saturday for dinner, I was SHOCKED with how amazing the food was. Vinnie's is very unassuming and casual from the outside, but the magic of these pizzas inside is all that you're going to care about. 

This pizza is without a doubt the BEST pizza I have had in the city of Pittsburgh. I have lived here for 7 years and eaten pizza everywhere, and THIS pizza, tops EVERYTHING I have had. It was huge, it was bubbly, it was messy in the best possible way, it was overflowing with toppings, it had the most perfect dough crust bubbles, flavor and texture. AMAZING. If you have not yet experienced this pizza, you better get down to Vinnies STAT and experience it. You have to know that a place is good when they literally have ONE thing on the menu: PIZZA. No wings, stromboli, calzone or pasta here. Just pizza. And for good reason. 

Luckily I went with a group of friends and got to see and eat a good variety of what they serve, Hawaiian pizza, \"the works\" pizzaa, and we had a \"medium\" (HUGE) with Canadian bacon, banana peppers, and pepperoni - one thing on the toppings here - they are not skimping on quality or amount on your pie. Our pizza was COVERED with big slices of GOOD Canadian bacon and was heavenly to say the least. 

The last thing I will mention here is the \"juice\" at the bottom of your Vinnie Pie pizza pan. OMG. I am usually a hater of the pizza \"juice\", but Vinnies pizza juice is made of magic and oozing flavorful goodness. We all used the pizza juice to dip our giant pieces of soft and crusty pizza crust in. Oh lord, I am getting hungry just thinking about this. 

Do yourself a favor and GET TO VINNIE'S.You will definitely not be sorry."}
{"text":"Vinnies is my favorite food in the entire world. Nothing can beat its flavor. It's quite a long haul for me to get here (hour 1/2), but well worth the trip. I have been coming here since I was a baby in a car seat and have continued the tradition with my son. I remember Vinnie slanging pies with a cigg hanging out of his mouth. It gives the sauce flavor. 
If I were on death row, I would request a large vinnie pie as my last meal."}
{"text":"I'm willing to wait in rush hour traffic on a 90 degree day so I can enter into this parallel dimension of unsanitary, unhealthy, and magically delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Time for a confession!  Until this past weekend, I'd never heard of a Vinnie Pie.  As an East Ender who grew up outside the greater Pittsburgh region, I suppose my ignorance can be forgiven--if grudgingly.

This all changed this weekend.  My friends, who I was helping move to a new house in Turtle Creek, were looking for pizza to feed me and their other moving helpers.  One of them mentioned she'd heard there was a pretty well-known pizza place in Turtle Creek that her boss liked.  After trying unsuccessfully to look it up via Yelp (which doesn't seem to recognize Turtle Creek, PA as a distinct city), I Googled it and quickly came upon Vincent's Pizza Park.  She confirmed that was the one, and I confirmed that it had a solid 4-star rating on Yelp, so we decided to order from there.

As soon as noon struck, I called and put in an order for 5 large pizzas: One cheese, one cheeseless (for someone who doesn't eat cheese), two pepperoni, and one Hawaiian ($95 total).  Because Vincent's is a cash only establishment and doesn't deliver, we went to pick up the pizzas after allowing 20 min. for them to be constructed.  Despite our perfect timing, they only had one pepperoni pie ready for us instead of two, so we had to wait an extra 15 min. for the second pie to be made.  The pizzas came wrapped in butcher paper, rather than in cardboard boxes, which made transporting them interesting, but we managed to pull it off well.

As soon as we got the pizzas to the new home, we tore into them (both literally and figuratively) with gusto.  I had three slices, encompassing everything but the cheeseless pie.  The pepperoni was my favorite, followed by the Hawaiian and cheese, respectively, but all of them were piled with extremely generous helpings of cheese and toppings.  Because of their sheer volume, they created a significant amount of grease, which was evident both on top of and underneath the middle of the slices.  As for the crust, it was thick, chewy, and substantial on the ends, and thin in the middle, to the point that the toppings slid off in at least one case.  This was definitely one of the most uniquely crusted pizzas I've ever eaten, due to the contrast between the ends and the middle, but it somehow worked.  Between 10 people, we ate less than half of the pizza we'd ordered due to the substantiality of the slices and the humongous size of the pies.  Despite this, all of us enjoyed it very much--it certainly hit the spot after 2.5 hours of heavy lifting and running up and down stairs repeatedly!

Vinnie pies (the name for any pie ordered from Vincent's Pizza Park--not a specific type of pie) are undoubtedly one of the most unique pizzas in greater PGH.  It's crystal clear from the reviews that people either love them or hate them--fortunately, I happen to fall into the former category.  Any establishment that produces such a unique product, esp. with a common item such as pizza, earns respect from me.  If you happen to be in the area and are looking for something different--or are just really hungry, give one a try!  It certainly beats Vocelli's, which I had at my last moving party, or the national chains, hands down."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh style pizza at it's greasy finest. When I think of pizza from my childhood, this is the pizza I dream about. 
Amazing sauce balanced with great crust, this pizza is the only thing I need in my life when I travel to Pittsburgh. The pepperoni alone makes this my favorite pizza. 
Prices are beyond reasonable and the pizzas are undeniably huge. I will return each time I come into town from Cincinnati."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places ever! The pizzas are huge and the toppings are very generous! I got mushroom and sausage,on a medium pizza last time and it took me a week to finish it! The sausages were,still nearly whole!"}
{"text":"We love Vinecent's Pizza in Forest Hills.  We had tried this one uite a few years ago and didn't think it was as good.  Tried it again tonight.  Entire bottom and edges were completely black.  Told that's what happens in hot ovens.  Well, excuse me - the whole pizza tasted like charcoal.  You'd think sausage would taste like sausage - not - it tasted like burnt dough. NEVER AGAIN!  One large pizza with sausage, mushrooms & onions, one beer and one iced tea -$36.00.  They should have paid us to eat it!"}
{"text":"WOW! That's a large Pizza Pie!!

My son recently moved within snack distance of Vincent's Pizza Park. Be aware that some GPS's do not like this area and ours had us headed in the wrong direction so we had to go back to the house, make a phone call and start again. 
Then, when we saw the place it was too late and we were on our way to another community with no way to turn around for a while.  Oh well, that's Pittsburgh for ya! lol 

When I called to order I asked how large the pizzas were and was told by the male who answered \"I can only eat maybe 2 pieces.\"  So, we ordered a large for the 4 of us, divided the toppings into 4 quarters and still had leftovers for the fridge.  They are very generous with the toppings!!

I liked the flavor of the pizza very much but it is very thick and I am more a fan of a thin crust. Too much bread for my tastes, so I kept to the center and left the 'bones'. That's not to say that I would turn down a pizza from Vincent's.  :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the, if not the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Its a mess of grease and flavor! Toppings are heaped on in a massive pile on fresh dough. Its a gruff place that has recently had quite the makeover. Its cash only which sucks but it is sure worth it. If you dont like greasy pizza, dont go period. Its sort of the point of their pizza."}
{"text":"Vincent Pizza Park in Forest Hills is the home of the \"Vinnie Pie\" which has been a family staple for 30+ years. We have traveled the journey with the \"Vinnie Pie\" through good, bad and the ugly. We have tried the other locations but they are not the same as the Original in Forest Hills, the home of the pie. Some have made comment of Shelley's Pie in Turtle Creek, a former employee, it is good, BUT not a \"Vinnie Pie\". It truly is: either you love it or hate it, and the controversy will continue.  After family saved and remodeled to keep the pie alive, there still seems to be an issue with the many signs on the window with keeping employees and cooks, either good or bad, we will continue to support. Like them on FB and join the club. Eating in is an experience you must try a least once. Back in the early days it was the only way to eat a pie. Over the years we have always taken out. I love the \"Everything But\" but being anchovies. Can't do those salty things. It is CASH and carry."}
{"text":"While in town on business we were looking for a local pizza place just to relax and eat. This place is a local treasure. Great food, small town feel and the desserts are killer."}
{"text":"Greasy but delicious. This is a heavy pizza that they do not skimp on toppings. If you like sausage on your pie then this is your place the sausage is plentiful and it is like meatballs."}
{"text":"Everyone has to get a vinnie pie at least once in thier life. After the first taste you will go back everytime you want pizza."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza.  It is thick, greasy and they are not shy with the toppings that you add.  If you like thin pizza, then it is not for you.  If you like it thinck and greasy - eat here- just don't go here for lunch if you have to go back to work.  It is that filling - and I know from experience that their pizza will put you in a cheese coma.
  Pricing is average to high - but it is so worth it.  Everytime I now come home to visit my parents - we make a special trip to Vincents Pizza Park."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this has always been of my favorites, I've gone to Vincents for literally 50 years.

Vincent's always put out a consistent pie, yes it had \"juice\", but they have a small menu pizza or salad and that's it...so you know what you're getting when you come here..until recently.

To be fair I wouldn't have downgrade my review after 1 or even 2 bad visits, but it's been 3 in a row which in my mind speaks to consistently, the Pizza still tastes ok but this came down to 3 things; service, quality, and value let's be honest...Pittsburgh has many good pizza shops.

Sadly the service is bad at best, the way customers are spoken is harsh the waitresses come across in a rude manner. Personally service is extremely important to me, almost as much so as the product I'm purchasing. I don't mind paying extra for good service.

As for their product, let's talk Pizza...

The quality of product they are serving has fallen off the charts. 
The anticipation was killing me, driving home with my Vinnie pie, I could smell it the whole way home...finally...as I tore through that white paper...my first thought was \"where are my toppings\" I ordered pepperoni and sausage, there was little of either and my pepperoni was mostly shredded...it barely stuck on the pizza...and no I didn't ask for shredded pepperoni...I expected much more from one of my former favorite $24 pizzas."}
{"text":"I never understood this Mineos-Aiello's rival thing. 

The fact that Vincent's Pizza Park exists makes every other pizza equally inferior. 

Bring cash and your appetite."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to a great pittsburgh  pizza shop . I'm from Maine and moved here a few months ago .we got a large which  was huge ! I loved the pizza and the service here."}
{"text":"I was over at a friend's to watch the Superbowl, and another friend was supposed to be bringing the pizza. We were like, wtf, what is taking so long to get pizza? So we call and he's like, \"I'm getting some special pizza. It'll be worth it.\" He finally showed up with not a pizza box, but a slab of cardboard wrapped in a sheet of white paper. I've eaten a lot of pizza, but a pizza that can't even be contained within a pizza box? I knew some ridiculousness was ahead of us.

This so-called special pizza was Vincent's. It was pretty special, indeed. In my mind, there's two categories of pizza: authentic Italian-style pizza, and cheap takeout pizza. Vincent's is one of the best examples I've had of the latter type. This is a cheese-lovers' pizza for sure. Massive globs of milky mozzarella cheese cover the pizza. I'm not sure if the cheese is homemade, but it had a tangy taste that usually comes from a fresh mozzarella. The water seeps out of the cheese and collects in the center of the pizza, which is a characteristic of traditional Neopolitan-style pizza. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but personally, I love myself a pizza with a soupy center. And while normally I like a New York style thin crust on my cheap pizza, Vincent's bready crust is the perfect complement to its over-the-top cheesiness.

Vincent's strikes me as a hybrid between traditional pizza techniques and the good ol' American appetite, and they definitely make it work for them. As a little pizza-obsessed Italian girl, I'm very glad I was introducted to Vincent's. I wish they delivered, but then again, I would probably be eating greasy pizza every day, so it's probably for the best."}
{"text":"Having passed by this place on a regular basis I finally came in. It took about 45 minutes to get a pie at the table. My eight year old took a bite, and spit it out. 

The pie tasted like oil and cheese. No discernible tomato sauce. This is just not what good pizza is. It was flavorless and just disappointing."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Crust was sooooo thick and center thin and undercooked.  Seems to me for the generous toppings there should be thicker dough in the center.  Great price for what you get but what I got wasnt great this time."}
{"text":"Vincent's Pizza Park is still home to the famous \"Vinnie Pie\" and is still sent home with you placed on cardboard and wrapped up in the white butcher paper and stapled up top . Just like the way I recall it years ago when Vinnie did the pizza tossing.

It's been a few plus years since I had a Vinnie Pie and I was  pleased and very happy to see the new interior along with the thriving business on a rainy Wednesday night.

The dining area is clean, comfortable and great for a dining party of one or for accommodating a much larger group.

Their menu suggests that they understand what simple means and that simple works!   They serve pizza.  They serve salad. They serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  That's it. Perfect.

A small, plain pizza (believe me this does not appear small at all!) starts at $10.00 and leads all the way up to the biggest pie called the Works and is a large priced at 35.25.

May the Vinnie Pie live on!
I look forward to another great night at Vincent's. 
Bring cash, though there is an ATM on-site."}
{"text":"Vinnie pie is a genre to its self.  While most pizza in Pittsburgh is more or less \"new york style\", Vincent's pizza is anything but \"thin crust\" - a big, thick (but not heavy - lots of air in there) bubbling crust with an awesome char, balanced with just the right amount of toppings.  Sausage is a particular stand-out topping - big pieces that would only work on Vinnie's crust with lots of great fennel flavor.  Meatball sub is tasty and weighs something like 20 lb.  This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh (sorry Mineo's/Aiello's), and my favorite pizza anywhere."}
{"text":"Not sure why I have to be difficult- the man a few reviews back suggested the pepperoni and I still went with the onions and mushrooms because I like to be difficult.

Things listed in other reviews:

Mile high cheese. Check.
Enough toppings to be a meal in themselves. Check.

Not mentioned in other reviews:

AWESOME 70s ambiance. 
Sodas in cans (I like them this way.
Beer in pitchers. 
Townies come here to watch movies. 

One downside- it smells like my mom's basement after a good rain. Not the best. But that's ok- the cheese on the pizza should be a good distraction."}
{"text":"If you're in the Pittsburgh area and do NOT know what a \"Vinnie Pie\" is, well... clearly, you're a total loser!    ;P
(Go rectify that!)

PROS:
The worlds greatest, ooey-gooey pizza!

CONS:
eh, not much for atmosphere.  Think:  \"hole-in-the-wall dive-bar\" meets \"Pizza shop\".
It is a bit pricey
No credit cards the last time we were there.


When you order toppings, Vinnie does NOT skimp on them!!!
If you order Sausage, they practically throw meatballs on your pizza!

TIP:  The \"Vincents Pizza\" @ PNC Park, is not the same thing!  Do not be fooled by imitators!
The only authentic \"Vinnie's Pizzas\" are located on Rt. 30.
(This location plus one in Norwin--again, both are right on Rt. 30)"}
{"text":"*Pizza is just as amazing as the Original Location & this Joint is about 100k times Cleaner!!*

It's my understanding that this is a \"licensed\" alternate location of the Original Vincent's Pizza Park on Ardmore Blvd in Forrest Hills. 
Also, located on Rt. 30 (but in the Irwin Area), this place is worth the extra drive to get that Vinnie's Pie that you've been craving!

PROS:
CLEANER, nuff said!
The wait staff is far friendlier at this location;
More of a Restaurant atmosphere, less like a hole in the wall dive-bar;
The WORLD'S best \"Slop Pie\"!!!

CONS:
Still Pricey for Pizza!


TIP:  I can't think of the name of it, but they sell this rootbeer in a glass bottle that is TO DIE FOR!  :)"}
{"text":"Vinnie Pie...The one and only! From time to time, I've been dismayed to read reviews from pizza lovers who did not like the Vinnie Pie. Then one day I had an epiphany. To compare a Vinnie Pie to an ordinary pizza is just not a reasonable comparison.  A Vinnie Pie is not really a pizza; it is something very different, its own unique thing. It's a Vinnie Pie. It might even be its own food group.

Those with OCD or those who are expecting a neat little pizza with neatly organized toppings and a uniform crust should not even go near this restaurant. A Vinnie Pie is pure entropic chaos on a platter.  A Vinnie Pie is so chaotic that nobody makes a box that will contain it. Instead, they make their own takeout package consisting of a giant slab of cardboard wrapped with white butcher paper over the top. 

The ingredients are the finest and freshest and that's one of the key elements that make a Vinnie Pie such an awesome sensory experience. I suspect there are other secrets known only to a select few.

Beyond that, words fail me on describing the Vinnie Pie itself. If you want to know more of what it's like, read the review by Darren W. His review comes closer than any words I can write.

The rest of this review is a self-endulgent trip down memory lane. I grew up in Forest Hills, but I left in 1980 along with everyone else. Now imagine it's 1979 and you're a 17-year old with the munchies. And you end up at Vincent's Pizza Park on a Saturday night. I can still see Vince behind the glass, flour in his hair, his glasses fogged with even more flour, a glass of beer on the counter, and the ubiquitous cigarette in the corner of his mouth. We used to speculate that cigarette ash was the secret ingredient. Those images are laser-etched in my brain.

I don't get to Pittsburgh very often any more, but I did get to stop in for a Vinnie Pie a couple of months ago.  I was pleased to see that the place looked pretty much the same. Of course, Vince is gone now. I've heard people say that the pizza isn't as good at it used to be, but to me, it seemed just as good as ever.

Rest in peace Vincent Chianese. The man may be gone, but his legend and legacy remain."}
{"text":"Been to Vincent's a few times. Very tiny cramped dining room. Pizzas are huge! Small is more like a medium other places. The pepperoni pizza is swami but be ready for a lot of grease!! We also got the buffalo chicken pizza...not bad. Also got a onion,green pepper and mushroom. Can never find any sauce on it. Way too much raw onion and very little peppers and mushrooms. Can taste the onions into the next day. It's more like an onion pizza....just way too much. Recommend sticking with pepperoni pizza. Any other the crust is wet and soggy. Pasta is huge but lacking sauce big time!!!!!! If you order it ask for a side of sauce."}
{"text":"1st time ordering here and I was blown away when I got my pizzas.  This place is a true hole-in-the-wall pizza parlor + bar, but they've got the best pizzas in the Burgh.  It's this little joint off Ardmore, but the folks manning the oven are Masters!  They crank out these giant, misshapen pizzas with fresh homemade ingredients and huge huge huge toppings.  Everything is hardcore good.  I got a large that had fine-ground, handcut pepperonis the size of giant checkers and sausage chunks like meatballs.  If you're looking for commercial-grade, round pizza shelled out to the masses, go elsewhere, but if you want the real deal, do yourself a favor and find this place 'cause Vincent's has the quality in the right place (the pizza).

UPDATE:  My review is now anecdotal.  Vincent's has been closed.  BOO!!"}
{"text":"OFF

THE

CHARTS.

Takeout, and STILL it was amazing pizza. EASIEST 5 I can remember giving.

We got bacon and sausage both times; the rub is that we kept eating well after we were full. Its that good. SLICES of bacon. And, the pic someone posted is correct, but its difficult to show the SIZE of this pie. Its BIG. A slice or two will be more than enough for most people. Cheese is tasty, and goodly amount. Sauce has a zip and character to it. It all works EXTREMELY well together.

I've had great pizza in various parts of NYC when I lived there for 8.5 years, and respectable pizza in so many places. But, this is our go-to.

REALLY good ribs next door. Party, best-of-class, one stop.

OH, we want to eat there next time. I can't put finger on WHY; the dine-in space wasn't especially fun or funky, but just... welcoming.

He who advised me of this place had been coming here for decades, and told of the pools of... well, ya know... if you eat in. Wrapped in butcher paper, the cardboard on which the 'za is placed for takeout, soaks up much of the greasy goodness. Ahhhh, something to which to look forward for eat-in..."}
{"text":"Has always been a favorite spot - until tonight! My boyfriend and I went in for a date night (drove an hour to get there). When we walked in the place was almost empty, which is rare so we were very excited! We always get the same thing so ordering took no time at all. The place filled up as we sat. Then an hour passed and 6 tables that were empty when we got there got served before us. Our waitress came back to the table and told us our pizza was accidentally wrapped to go and it would be out in a minute. 20 minutes later, she brings us a burnt pizza. We decided not to eat it and to leave instead. She asked us to pay for our drinks, which we gladly did. But then, as if this experience could get any worse, as we were walking out she started yelling at us in front of the entire restaurant. How unprofessional can you get?! No complimentary drinks for terrible service and even more so NO APOLOGY! And then I am yelled at? Needless to say, we will never be back. Shelley Pie til we die!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have a clue about this pizza.  I decided to order a small plain to go and was told an hour wait.  No problem.  It's a holiday weekend and they are busy.  I get there an hour later and wait for about 15 min.  NO ONE acknowledged me.  I waited and waited.  I was just about to leave when someone finally asked if I had been waited on.  I said no.  She went and checked and my pizza hadn't even been made yet.  RIDICULOUS!!  I will never go back.  I don't give a shit how good it supposedly is.  And I watched 2 people complain about burnt pizza.  There are many great pizza places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!  We got the pepperoni and mushroom, and I'm thinking that it was easily 2.5 lbs of toppings. People, this pizza made its own broth.  A medium is way more than enough for two people...and we ate so much that we didn't need to eat again for a good 30 hours or so.  

I have to take off a star for environmental concern.  1) There was an ant colony running around my table, and 2) the place was FULL of screaming kids.  I know that's not the restaurant's fault but it was pretty distracting.

However, I will definitely come back to have more of the world's best pizza...as soon as I run out of my current supply of leftovers.  And this time...I will get it to go."}
{"text":"No longer named Vincents. I guess the owners split up and the guy owning the recipe is still there. Its not a sit down place and very dark and crammed.  But the pizza is very good if you like the orginal grease recipe. I'm sorry folks if you have not really lived in the pizza cities  you won't know if this is good or bad by reviews.  I see some less experienced  pizza tasters whom like the babies and bimbo type pizzas cutting it up. But that is not good pizza but maybe locals think so. More power to them. But whatever  the new name of this place is has continued the great grease traditional  pizza. I prefer carry out the inside dinning is not a great presentation  but who cares if you need a pizza for dinner at home or party. Its the best yet in the Westmoreland  County scene and no matter what anyone says try it."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good but it is GREASY.  Oh, so greasy. Its not too bad but just a warning. The staff is kind and its a nice place to sit and have a good meal. I wish they had more things to offer then just pizza & salads but eh, its not a problem. Not one of my favorites but I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  This place is just GOOD! Came here for the first time since the new owners and remodel.  Ordered a large with pepperoni and sausage. Great service and Pizza.  Having grown up in North Braddock I recalled the \"old\" place and Vincent. He'd be proud the tradition carries on...good stuff....will be back...."}
{"text":"Eating pizza here borderlines having a religious experience. 

Ate here with my brother who consumes pizza like its his job. Vincent's had been on our radar for weeks and, upon pulling into the parking lot, I understood why. The place has this old route 66 roadhouse vibe, complete with crappy neon. But don't, dear friends, judge that proverbial book by its cover because the true magic awaited us inside.

We were seated right away by a super friendly, young waitress. Big, clunky picnic table style seating, with a HUGE bottle of franks red hot on the table!!!! YES. We ordered out pies, 2 total: one with all of the meats (too many to remember) and another with onions, peppers and mushrooms. Both a size small. 

This pizza is more like a sculptural work of art, with a taste to match. The crust was light and crisp with a nice sweetness. Tangy perfect sauce and huge chunks of veggies just strewn about, like someone hand- ripped the green pepper and scattered it about. I love, love me some rustic throw-down pizza and I think that Vincent's just may be the best example of this I have ever seen, with a taste to match!

Don't expect to get up and run the 5k after this one though. There are greasy gobs of cheese for miles here. You may fall asleep at the wheel on your way home so I suggest pairing this fantastic meal with a large fountain drink."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The quality of the food has hit rock bottom. The pizza was flavorless. The wait staff was rude. It's as if they expected you to be grateful that they were serving you. The place was not as clean as it should have been. The entire experience made it clear that I never have to go back. Go to Shelly Pie Pizza instead. It's what Vincent's was 30 years ago"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good but the service wasn't very good. And they also charge you $2.25 for water, which is ridiculous. But the pizza was bomb."}
{"text":"I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant. Why? I waited 2 hours for a burned pizza for which the staff and manager were not even concerned or slightly apologetic. In fact, they were extremely rude, manager included. Plus, the pizza was soggy and bland in addition to it being burned. Such a waste of money especially because they are on the more expensive side. Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in pittsburgh! Huge greasy and delicious! Took an hour to get pizza but it was 7 on a saturday so that was expected. Service was excellent and food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in my world.  Please know it's cash only and sometimes the wait is a bit long. But it is worth it. Have a beer and enjoy family time.  The pizza will make you happy.  Employees are great and friendly"}
{"text":"The one and only Vincent's.  Accept no substitutes.

It's not often that I throw down the coveted 5 stars for a dive pizza joint, but just to show how good it is, Vincent's is a 45 minute drive, each way, from my in-laws house, and I go there pretty much every time I'm back in the Burgh.

I grew up in New York, so I'm pretty serious about my pizza pie, but Vincent's is without a doubt the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure it's the only destination pizza joint I have in my repertoire (aside from Lou Malnati's in Chicago, but that's not really pizza...).

I always get the same thing when I come here, the Everything, But... (pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onion, god knows what else... everything, but anchovies).  It comes with enough toppings for 5 pizzas.  The hardest part is letting it sit at the table long enough to cool down to a consumable temperature.  My favorite is to dip the crust in the leftover juices on the pan from all of the toppings.  Be warned, it takes a bit of time to cook (this ain't Little Ceasar's), which I think adds to the experience.  

Last time I was there, they had added some new beers on tap (available in pitchers), including Magic Hat, which is nice.  If all else fails, nothings beats a Vincent's pie and a pitcher of Yuengling.

Nothing fancy.  Just good pizza and cold, frosty beer, done right."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst pizzas I have ever had.  The crust is doughy and soggy, there's no sauce to speak of, there's too much cheese and too many toppings.  It was a mess.  You can't put this many toppings on a pizza and have it bake properly.  There was a huge lake of watery nothing all over the pan.  A great pizza is that perfect harmony of crust to sauce to cheese and toppings.  I couldn't make a worse pizza if I set out to do it.  

To top off the misguided and poorly cooked nightmare they call a pizza it had no seasonings.  They put out an empty six pack with salt, pepper, pepper flakes, oregano, powdered garlic and hot sauce.  Are you kidding me?  This is as ridiculous as Beto's with the bread and sauce with cold shredded cheese on top.  I am disgusted and insulted just thinking about this meal.  It was one of the worst I have had in Pittsburgh and I have had dozens of bad ones here.  

If you desperate enough to eat here, I would order one with extra sauce, light on the cheese and plain.  It's so flavorless though I would ask for half pepperoni or sausage to add some flavor and tell them you want them to take that half and spread it over the entire pizza.  

I prefer crisp thin crust pizza but I am from Chicago and also like deep dish and am just fine with a nice NY style slice too.  I love pizza.  It's one of my favorite meals.  This is none of the above.  If you want a pizza that is comparable to what they are trying to do, go to Burgh Pizza & Wing in Bridgeville.  This is a NY style slice with the droopy center and thick corona of crust.  Perfectly balanced cheese, sauce and delicious well cooked crust.  The sauce is flavorful and slightly spicy, not too sweet and very well seasoned with herbs and salt!  I have no idea what this is.  

I was totally misled by the reviews of this restaurant.  If there are 500 pizzas in Pittsburgh, I would try this one last if I were you.  This is a Pizza only Pittsburgh could love."}
{"text":"Ordered a carryout and was told 1hr 15. Showed up after 1hr 30 and was told 3-4 mins. After waiting 40 mins, asked how much longer and they no longer had a record of my order. No apology of course. Ordered here every Superbowl for as far back as i can remember. Never again. Glad there's a Shelly pie nearby. Vinny would be turning in his grave if he could see how these retards run his restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome pizza.  So glad my Forest Hills friends took me here while I was at CMU in the 90's.  I'm still coming back 20 years later, now with my kids.

The pizza is absolutely amazing - just a perfect balance of thin crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.  But the best part for me remains sopping up the peppeoni grease on the tray with the over thick crust.  It tastes like a nice olive oil with a little seasoning in it on the crust."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have come back to Pgh and have had a Vinnie Pie but when I did I really enjoyed it.  I had to be sure I was visiting someone who could help me eating it.
There are only 3 places for pizza in the USA that I really like and Vincents is one of them.  Also Ginos East in Chicago and the NYPD (In AZ)  which is the only one that makes the Sicilian style like I used to buy walking down the streets and going up to a pizza window to buy a slice.
Just wonder how much a Vinnie Pie would cost to have one sent to me in Phoenix AZ?"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the service is aweful.  Strike three for me was I waited 15 minutes after being seated for someone to take my order,  no one ever came.  We eventually left.  The sad thing is there were only three other parties in the place at dinner time on a Saturday.   See you on Restaurant Impossible soon. Completely unaccommodating for families with small children."}
{"text":"For me it is a go to when I want big chunks of meats on a pizza slice that is bigger than my head. Amazing flavor with a great pizza shop eat in vibe. It is a great family night out and a must for any of our guest who visit from out of town. Simply nothing better than a Vinny Pie!"}
{"text":"Not only a guilty pleasure but also a family tradition; greasy messy but in a very delicious way. What would Pittsburgh be without a vinnie pie?! Pepperoni moutain high! Fresh Sausage blobs! and, a huge layering of Fresh! Mushrooms nothing is small scale not even a small pizza haha. This pizza place is totally a Pittsburgh hidden gem and, I definitely see me and the Vinnie pie growing old together."}
{"text":"You don't know Pittsburgh, nor can you call yourself a true Pittsburgher unless you've had a Vinnie pie. Another place that's been around forever, my dad knows the original Vinnie, and this a place he'd go to basically close down the bar with him. Fantastic pizza, which when I was a kid I wasn't too fond of. Don't trust any imitators, this is the original and the real deal. And it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"a vinnie pie. heard so much about them and ohh what a surprise. i dont know what was better, the watery cheese that ran to the center or the totaly burnt bottom. a wheee bit overpriced and just not good at all.  beware from a good pizza fan."}
{"text":"I'm glad that a place like this exists - it's a unique place to take visitors - but I couldn't possibly eat here more than three or four times a year. By comparison, I get pizza from Vocelli's approximately 25 times per year. Vincent's pizza is much, much \"heavier\" than Vocelli's and cranks all of the unhealthy aspects of pizza up to 11... which is fun once in awhile for the \"shock value\" of it, but it's hard to call the result \"food\"."}
{"text":"It just doesn't get any better than this. Bring an appetite...if you haven't tried this landmark Pittsburgh pizza...you ain't a yinz er yet. None better."}
{"text":"I finally tried this pizza last night with a few of my co-workers. 

If this were a Silver Age Lee/Kirby comic book monster tale, my review would be titled...

\"WE FOUGHT MONZZZTERRELLA, THE LIVING PIZZA THAT TOOK OVER PITTSBURGH!\" 

Let me preface this by saying that I am a lifelong South Hills resident but have known of this restaurant for years only through word of mouth (hushed tones?)and a featurette on our local PBS affiliate. 

They don't make pizzas like Vincent's in the South Hills. 

No pizza place I know of has a picture of the owner on its sign. 

Ours are neatly made, respectable. 

Vincent's pizza comes from Hell. 

This is a pizza made by a madman, a lunatic, a megalomaniac. H.P. Lovecraft would have written of it. Black Sabbath may have composed \"E5150\" because of it. 

The crust is bloated, deformed and threatens to usurp the rest of the pie. It almost...pulsates. The toppings and cheese are seemingly put on the pizza by a 12 foot tall ogre via a \"grab and throw\" technique .  

There's no rhyme or reason to the fixings. We got our pizza with \"the works.\" The toppings were scattered, splattered like the innards of mutilated cattle. The pie could not contain them. The spare toppings alone could have made for a meal. That's how much material is piled onto the pizza, and it's all quite literally PILED onto the pizza. The toppings have a life of their own. They scuttle off of the pizza and onto the table like parasites clinging to and falling off of what the Army would call a \"Large Scale Aggressor.\" 

The bottom of the pie is thin, crisp and has a brimstone flavor. 

This is a pizza borne of the devil's fire.

Each slice slithers off of the warped pan and onto your plate, leaving its entrails behind.

But I implore you, for the love of all that is holy and of the light, do not try to pick up this pizza and eat it. Use silverware and make sure your knife and fork are each blessed by a priest. This pizza will devour the poor soul that tries to tackle it unarmed. 

Determining when and where the pizza ends is a mystery. It's a lost world unto itself, complete with an underground lake of broth (grease?) that beckons you...

...to dip your crust into it. 

I feared for the safety of the lovely, innocent brunette who waited on us.  She is not working there willfully. She couldn't be. Someone must be keeping her soul in a jar.

Or was she a siren, lulling us into a false sense of security and then leading us into doom with her charm? 

 I was totally unprepared. This isn't a pie that one could even conceive of having delivered. I wouldn't dare take it home. I wouldn't want the accursed, powerful thing in my house. It might eat the cats. 

They wrap it in paper, as if they know that this beast of burned dough, bloody sauce, lumpy, piquant meat,  maniacally chopped vegetables and oozing, sentient, alien symbiote cheese cannot be contained by anything. Keeping it in a cardboard box would be futile. Its hot, acidic juices alone would...

The horror! It's best not to think of it without holding a rosary or another holy artifact.

I still say that Bellisario's Pizza in Baldwin is the zenith of Pittsburgh pies. Theirs is a righteous, noble pizza that is made by those stout of heart. It is the Beowulf of pizzas. Vincent's is a terrifying hybrid of Grendel and the Frankenstein Monster. Bellisario's would slay this creature, but it would be a narrow and costly victory. 

A masterpiece of culinary evil is what we found, and we barely survived the encounter, foolhardy interlopers that we were. 

I'm still downing Tums in an attempt to exorcise it. It's inside me, threatening to get out, getting in my head, telling me to go back and have some more."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh, period - try it if you have not yet.  Then try it again with your friends to impress them all, claiming that it's some random pizza joint you found once.  

The Pepperoni pizza is THE best.  

The place looks like a dive bar in many ways, but the pizza could not be better.  If you get take-out, bring a towel to put on the seat/floor of your car, underneath the pizza, as the grease will surely run through the cardboard and paper.  And yes, the pizza is as greasy as it comes, so all you de-greasers (me included) will be in de-greasing heaven (or hell, depending on your viewpoint)."}
{"text":"The pizza's at Vincent's are the biggest I've seen, the crust is good, and the edges are thick.  When you get different toppings on your pizza, you get a lot of toppings, no skimping!  The service was good, and pretty quick we didn't wait to long for our pizza. They serve only Beer and Wine."}
{"text":"Vinnie Pie is the food of the Gods, the pizza of legends. Sure, I grew up on the stuff, living in walking distance. The melting pot of a dining room was filled with all types and the rumors of cigarette ash in the sauce and a chef who'd both enter and exit the restroom with flour on his hands did nothing to deter me from consuming countless slices of this ginormous pie.

Loaded with cheese, meats and veggies, this pizza makes weight and the puddle of grease in the middle only adds convenience for crust dippers. A beautiful combination of slightly-burnt yet floury, Vinnie Pie defines pizza satisfaction. The joint has been cleaned up a bit since my youth, but you can feel the history of the place, sense the joy of diners past. I've witnessed Fed Ex men picking up pies to ship across the country. 

Now, I came, I saw, I bought the shirt. Sure to be a conversation piece no matter where I go; as the Vinnie Pie is a well deserved world wide phenomenon."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have ever had. Staff was absolutely wonderful! Very tentative to our every need. The poor girls were extremely busy. They addressed every customer to let them know there would be a wait. I didn't mind waiting for the scrumptious pizza. I gave them 4 stars for a reason. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have not been here in over 20 years, and Vincent, you did not disappoint.  

Just remember that a large is not a human-sized large.  

This is the best pizza place in not only Pittsburgh but the entire world.

Get the sausage for maximum grease factor!"}
{"text":"Always saw the parking lot packed which is a good sign to me to try it out. Finally got the chance to go in, sat down right away, the service was a little slow but there was a lot of customers. When the waitress took our order she said it could be one hour before it is ready. We were dining in! Was irritated about the long wait but hope it was worth it. When the pizza finally arrived, a little over one hour later, it was massive and loaded. I was impressed and the taste was great! In the future though, I think I will try to call ahead so I'm not stuck at a table for so long. Not good when you are trying to keep two young kids tamed."}
{"text":"I used to work at a hospital near by and while in my care, he RAVED about this pizza spot. He would reminisce about his family outings throughout his life to eat at Vincent's Pizza. After driving past this place everyday for nearly a year, I finally decided to stop! Boy, am I glad I did! The restaurant itself is warm, family oriented, and inviting. All of the employees are kind and smiling. I felt comfortable relaxing and enjoying my time there. This pizza was by far the best pizza I have had in this area! I would definitely make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"I am fortunate to live close to Vinnie's Pizza.  If you want to take step back to the early years of Pittsburgh and have a fun history lesson at the same time you should come here!  The pizza is delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients.  The pepperoni pizza has fresh sliced sticks of pepperoni covering the pie.  If you get it to go they put the pizza on a cardboard sheet, put paper over-top of it and then staple the paper to the bag!  
  Health wise, this may take several years off of your life!  But then again, those extra years might not be the same without Vincent's Pizza!"}
{"text":"One of the best in the Burgh period!!!!! You might have to wait a while if it's packed but it's well worth the wait... One of the east sides best"}
{"text":"It has a lot of grease. Less grease and it would rate a 4.
I have had it three times. It seems each time I get it the greaser  it is. Great sausage. It's really not Pizza. It's a bunch of dough,cheese and grease thrown together. It's like they don't care about the product."}
