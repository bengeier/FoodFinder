{"text":"If you specifically request guacamole and they charge you the extra \"fee\" for it, then they should put it on your damn burrito...  They even forgot the mild salsa.    First and last time eating at Baja Fresh.  Should have made the drive to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Rude, service was poor. Charged for children's meals when it says kids eat free on Sunday. Refused to refund both meals. Said she was the manager and owner (cook agreed), but asked for me to initial receipt for her (she didn't know what to say about who she needed it for) and give phone number for some office. So, it seems she is not the owner after all. Diana Garcia offered to send me a VIP pass for the situation, but never sent it.   This seems like a very shady company to us.  We won't be eating at any of the locations again.   Better food can be had at other establishments.  El Pollo Loco is one recommendation."}
{"text":"Bothered how MARTHA the GM of baja fresh bagged up my order . Never did before so whats the  problem ? .#bajafresh #bocapark  never again ."}
{"text":"The only reason they even get a one star is because the staff is nice and the cook makes good food. The biggest problem this location has is the person running it. One time we came in and the guy at the counter instantly apologized because they were out of stock on almost everything because no one placed an order to restock their supply. Another time I called ahead because I had my kid with me and I wanted to be in and out and the guy waited till I got there before even starting my order, but he had plenty of time talking on his phone. When I asked him why they didn't start when I had called, he gave me attitude. That will be my last time going, the one in the Texas Casino is much better anyways"}
{"text":"I had one crispy fish taco on a corn tortilla and one carnitas pork taco on a corn tortilla with their hot salsa. I enjoyed both but if I had to choose, the carnitas pork was the best of the two."}
{"text":"wouldn't take my gift card.  Gave no warning until the register.  Only ate here because I had the gift card as a gift.

I don't mind them not taking them ... Just warn me before I order and am forced to pay cash!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you pay. Way too pricey!"}
{"text":"Never get your food to go at this location. If you do, buyer beware. Foreign objects, like metal, have been deemed acceptable ingredients here. I got a taco plate to go here and found a strip of metal by biting  into it. When it was brought to the attention of Baja Fresh, their response was \"since you got the food to go, too bad\". Way to treat your guest and care about the quality of your product. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Wahoo Skinny bowl is delicious! Very clean restaurant. Parking SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Luis is the best! Thank you for a great experience at Baja Fresh! The food was perfect. The service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped by a few weeks ago, the service was slow, and the meat in the tacos tasted like it had been sitting out all day.  I eat at other Baja Fresh locations and this one just didn't compare.

This morning, I read in the news that this place was shut down due to a cockroach infestation: http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Pho-Little-Saigon-255421341.html

\"Roaches of all shapes and sizes earned them a swift shut down.\"

Yep...I won't be returning to this one, like...ever."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!! I swear to god  i got  sick pretty  bad. I had  bread and butter for breakfast. Bought the day prior from smiths. I had no lunch. An hour or so after my baja fresh  dinner i got really  sick. 

This is 100% dangerous.  Do not eat here. Go anywhere  else.  Just  not here."}
{"text":"We went at 5:00 on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there.  It took at least 5 min to get chips.  DIRTIEST bathroom at any Baja I have ever seen!  A woman came in BAREFOOT and they served her.  Their highchairs are covered in old food.  The black and white checked floor was black and brown... filthy.  Will go to a different Baja location from now on.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for me; it meets my needs and has a very tasty vegetarian burrito. I eat here once every week or so. I would recommend it for those who want fast, simple fare."}
{"text":"Very good people and fresh food every time. Register  (Antonio) & Cook (Roberto). Both provide high end customer service skills each and every time. Antonio good with greeting customers from moment in to moment out also stays busy keeping the restaurant nice and clean. Roberto, very good at what he does in the kitchen along with good customer service skills to back it up. Check them out!!! Affordable, tasty and comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place many times but recently everything has been going down the hill. Food not as good as it used to be and I don't need to say anything about the service !!"}
{"text":"the fish tacos here taste very bland......no flavor whats so ever........i would not recommend this place and its very expensive for non authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Terrible burrito, was just stuffed with rice. Could barely taste any cheese or salsa despite asking the staff to add extra. The staff were not particularly friendly. Overpriced and just not worth it. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"While waiting 15 minutes for an order of queso I watched the girl preparing it stir the whole pot with her ungloved finger and then test it on the inside of her wrist like it's baby formula. The manager then gave me coupons for a free taco or two dollars off next time because I waited so long for melted cheese. Then today when I tried using the coupon the manager told me I had to spend at least $8.00. Maybe I don't know how to read but it doesn't say anywhere that there is a minimum purchase."}
{"text":"I came here tonite after my workout at EOS. It was right next to my gym so why not. I ordered a Baja bowl with chicken, black beans, veg, NO RICE with a side of extra veg and extra chicken on the side..my meal cost me $15 and some change and I didn't even get a drink to go with my meal. I got my food and I have to say, I am not very please. My bowl has way too much beans in it and very little veggies. I could count the pieces of bell peppers that was on it. It almost look like a bean soup. Extra side of chicken was over priced. You don't get much for $4.99. I am not a frequent Baja customer but I don't remember it being this pricey for a meal. And I don't remember the bowl having this much beans. Guess I'll have to ask for LESS beans and MORE veggies on my next visit. Service was friendly though and the place is clean."}
{"text":"The worst experience ive ever had, i ordered the tostada and all they gave me were beans! Ni lettuce and no chicken! And i paid extra for sauce! They play u! Take your money and give u shitty food! Cafe Rio all day fuck baja!"}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is always good, clean, quick and reasonably priced. Not authentic? Who cares! Tastes great to me."}
{"text":"Good food and great service, plus free salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Long lines... blah
 
service was vey slow the worker didn't have a smile on their face! not very cheap but overall good food!"}
{"text":"Really glad they have reopened.  Food is always fresh and simple.  I usually get a Ultimo burrito but like the Baja ensalada too.  They include a small amount of chips that is just the right size for me.  The staff size is at least doubled so there are short if any wait times.  I hope the new owners keep going in this direction. I like having the TVs on since I eat alone fairly often so I wish they would keep them on and keep sports or news or TMZ or the like.  
I also tried the churros which were fresh and warm and not too sweet, very good!  Prices are very reasonable.  My burrito is a meal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited over twenty minutes, finally caught the counter girl trying to serve my shrimp bowl to a dine in customer when I had a to go order. Waited longer for my two fish tacos, never a thank you, no one there speaks legible English! When I got home and ate the tacos, the fish was so over cooked it was like leather, and cold as hell because they had been sitting forever before I was served. I've had bad experiences every time there, so never again. Go up the street a few blocks to Rubios, much better!!!!"}
{"text":"It's airport food, but i was hoping Baja Fresh would taste like it did outside of the airport. I got the chicken burrito special and it tasted fresh, but was pretty bland. I probably should've gotten some hot sauce or something to give it some flavor. Now that I think of it...they didn't even offer me any salsa or anything! Boo."}
{"text":"I was visiting in LV and this was close by.  Beings I'm from a small town with few restaurants like this, I gave it a try.  I liked it!  I had a HUGE Nacho Burrito for lunch.  I went back for dinner and had one of their salads.  The salsas are really tasty.  All in all I'll be back whenever I make it back to the area.  It's on the order of Rubio's and Chipolte, which I've tried in other cities, not mine for sure........"}
{"text":"Anytime were in a region that has Baja Fresh, we go to Baja Fresh. The food was great and they were quick. They don't have mango salsa anymore though, which is a bummer. But I think this place has the best things about chipotle and rubios combined."}
{"text":"Horrible service! As i was placing my order the girl at the cash register rolled her eyes because i asked for no veggies in my bowl and told me she got it...sure enough got my bowl and it had veggies on it. She was rude"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. This location has really slipped as of late. We used to love Baja Fresh but after our visit last night, we won't be returning. 
The recent advertising flyer stated $1.99 to add a third taco. At the location, the same advertising said $2.49. When I asked, the manager on duty said \"the flyer is wrong, it is $2.49.\" Not \"that's a mistake but we will honor the ad.\" I said \" so this is false advertising\" and he replied \"yes it is\". I had to argue with him and point out that he was not taking care of his customers with that kind of attitude. It took 5 minutes of arguing (politely) but he finally said, \"You want that price, I can give you that price.\" The amount wasn't an issue, it was the bad attitude that really irked me. He did actually just comp one whole meal so that was good on his part.
The gal at the counter was not happy to be there and it showed.
The food was below the usual standards and just not good. The floor was not clean. The salsa bar had old moldy tomatoes and peppers for garnish. (pic). 
Like I said earlier, underwhelming. Too bad, they used to be so good. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I do not know if it's my flavor profile or what but they need to renames the chili fries to barbecue fries no meat

I have gotten better chili fries a a little league game 

I really do not like bashing a restaurant but come on how could they mess this up"}
{"text":"Yo!! This location is nastttyyyyyy! So mad I didn't read the reviews before I ate there! The meat did taste weird and my pinto beans were funky!! Baja Fresh was Baja Funk. Beware of this location! 

While we were eating a little after 8:00pm they turned the lights off on us! And we were confused so I looked at the closing time. They close at 8:45? That's odd... 
But still how do you expect us to eat in the dark?! Freaking weird as hell.  She kept eye balling me, so I kept eye balling her back. Lol"}
{"text":"Do not go here.  Ordered a chicken burrito. It was so bad (the pico de guillo tasted like bleach) that I finally decided to just throw it in the toilet....you know...to cut out the middleman. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is probably the best place to grab a cheap, good bite to eat inside the Excalibur. While staying for a week, we ate here twice and probably would have more if we had known it was this good. It's also conveniently located near the Tower II elevators, so if you're staying there it's a good bet.

The first trip, I had the Ultimo Burrito which was very filling and delicious. Not too spicy, but flavorful all the same. Each dish comes with a healthy serving of tortilla chips and you get to choose your own dipping sauce at a little bar at the back of the restaurant.

On our second trip, I had the Cheese Quesadillas and we ordered a plate of Cheese and Bean Nachos to split. We were both filled to the brim with cheesy and bean goodness. If you walk away from this place hungry, it's your own fault. With drinks, our total came out to be around $21.

Staying at the Excalibur, are on a budget and don't want to eat at McDonald's every day and night? Eat at Baja Fresh, I'm willing to bet you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed....  food is nowhere it used to be. I moved here 5 years ago from California and the Baja Fresh I remember is NOTHING like what is here in Vegas.  Vegas version has the worst taste. In fact, there is no taste now and that includes their pico de gallo and hot salsa.  Terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Their burritos and reg tacos may be good, I don't know. Their fish tacos however are a far cry from good ones. Avoid these. Nevada is land locked after all so seafood is not recommended."}
{"text":"If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again."}
{"text":"This place has good food but they have begun to fall short in a couple of areas. They no longer have a CCSD teacher discount. They also had to repeat one order three times before it came out right. In addition, they rung up the order wrong this charging us incorrectly. The size of the queso has been diminished also. They were accommodating about their mistakes, but to many downers for us to return."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean location.  Counter service was super friendly.  Sizeable salsa bar with five kinds, although I found them all to be terribly runny for my tastes.  Also watery in texture and taste, nothing was spicy or flavorful enough.  Free chips included with your meal, which is nice.  Chicken Baja bowl was boring... White rice (no brown rice available), black beans, peppers and onions.  Enchilada style pork burrito was a step up, but too much rice filler and not enough meat.  Basically very average food, don't expect to be wowed.  Should have went to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great experience all the way around, just how I remembered on the old Baja Fresh days."}
{"text":"I picked the Último Chicken Burrito. The taste is great and the ingredients seem very fresh. The green peppers gave a unique taste. Good customer service as well. Very happy with first experience."}
{"text":"Good only if you enjoy cold garbage! It's 24hours but the food has been sitting around just as long!"}
{"text":"The air conditioner is not broken, the owner is just to cheap to run it cool, I was sweating so bad I don't even know if the food was good, seriously I won't go back, one taco is $2.89. I used to eat at Baja Fresh all the time but I feel as though the prices are very unreasonable, honestly Mexican food isn't that expensive to make."}
{"text":"I was bummed when I first moved to Vegas and this place had just closed.  I was excited when it reopened and I've been twice now.  The new management is marvelous.  How do I know this?  The employees are happy and working well together.  They seem to like their jobs and want to make the customers satisfied.  The food was as great as I've always gotten from any Baja Fresh.  There were no long lines either time I went and the wait for my food was not very long.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're open til 9pm, you should stay open til 9pm. I like this place, but they just pissed me off right now having their doors locked 20 minutes before closing."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of coming to Vegas last July and the dry heat killed! Sooo not used to that type of heat.

Stomping around on the strip sucked all the life/hydration outta me! Stopped into the hotel seeking a nonalcoholic Drink, AC & a spot to sit and cool off for a bit. We found a Baja fresh, after paying like $4 @ just about every little food/drink cart in the hotels for every tea/soda.  We went pretty stoked to see a bj's. We got a couple iced teas and some chips and guacamole, this spot has a great salsa bar with like 5-6 varieties to accompany your meal or snacks. my favorite was a mango based salsa. really refreshing and a little kick from the jalapeno. our bill was under $10 bucks and the guacamole 8-9oz container overflowed."}
{"text":"They used to be great, but now, it's like a salt lick overly priced and tiny portions.  I've moved my business to Zaba's!"}
{"text":"Baja Steak Burrito is what I get every time...  Good stuff!  I love the Mango Salsa and unlimited Pico, Hot Sauce at the salad bar.  It's located by my wife's Luxy Nail Salon.  Very convenient for me"}
{"text":"I was so sad when you closed last year. I was driving up to Boca Park today and I saw the lights on and you were open again  you don't know how happy I am. Your fish and shrimp tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"While the food might not be the best Mexican and how can it be since it is Tex-Mex which is an abomination in and of itself, the counter help was so pleasant.  The were smiling, thorough, kept the line moving, up selling...everything you could want as a business owner and customer. I see this location has gotten low reviews in the past but in this day at this time, 5/4/18 @ 1:15pm, the crew working was great.
I started to give it 4 stars but based on this one visit  and no other, it is as a 5 star visit!"}
{"text":"Worst burrito I ever tried with marked up  airport price.  I ordered the ultimo chicken burrito, nothing was ultimo about it.  Chicket was EXTREEEEEEEEEMELY dry, hardly tasted any cheese or veggies.  Only the taste of dry chicken and sourcream was in there, disgustingly mushed up.  Chips are okay, crispy, but nothing special compared to others like chipotle."}
{"text":"This was the best burrito I've had. Apparently they can give you fresh tomatoes and onions if you don't like the pico de gallo.  No one has ever told me this till now.  I'm allergic to cilantro and I told the woman this.. so she asked if I wanted the tomatoes and onion freshly chopped?  Hell yeah!  I hope all locations do this. They weren't stingy with the onions. I love onions! I always get the same thing.. veggie burrito extra black beans and no pico. On a plate. Enchilada style. :) This one was perfect. The restaurant was clean. In a good location. The staff was very nice. I wish it had gone to this location before I moved away from Vegas. I'll be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Well im happy to say the food here has improved alot! chips gucamole tacos, much better lately. We will continue to come back here."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Baja Fresh. Good menu and the food is freshly prepared. I usually always get the Baja Steak Burrito but the tacos, salads and rest of the menu are equally good.
The salsa bar is great, they have a nice choice of freshly prepared salsa for topping off your meal. I like that you get a small side of chips to go with your burrito. Would much rather go to Baja Fresh than a fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"Not my first time of visiting a baja... but definitely the bestest. This review is mostly based on the level of customer service I received. 

The moment I walked in the door I was warmly greeted by Gisela with her gorgeous smile asking if I was ready to order or needed more time. she respected that I needed a few minutes to decide then came over. She also patiently took my annoying order \"little of this, none of that, don't forget...\" she repeated it back perfectly and even asked personally, \"Are you having a rough day?\" ... to which I just said I'm looking forward to my next day off. Still, who asks about your day anymore?! awesome stuff. 

Not to stop there... as I found a table to sit and wait for my burrito, she came over and apologized saying \"I might have sprayed a product with bleach here. sorry\" well I don't see any stains on my uniform and it's not like it was her fault anyways. 

I even watched her as she told the cook precisely how I wanted everything prepared and it came out perfectly and tasty. 

Excellent customer service! she even mentioned \"have a good day & come back here soon\" I'll have to take her up on that since I work nearby. 

I know it's just Baja Fresh, but if you haven't visited this location or had the pleasure of meeting Gisela then you're missing out on an awesome guest experience."}
{"text":"Very good steak burrito made Chipotle style. Fast and accommodating service even on a Saturday nite. Would have given more stars but very overpriced  ... but it is Vegas so ok but not a bargain."}
{"text":"Terrible Food. Baja Fresh WAS arguably the Best Fast/Casual Tex/Mex Restaurant in America. It has rapidly deteriorated through the years. I wish the Original Founders ( Magglos Family ) would buy back this once Great company. The Salsa bar is bleh, prices have risen and the Food Quality is average @ Best ! Is it any wonder that their Stores are Closing ???"}
{"text":"This location is pretty bad.  Be warned if you go in at an off hour they will just let you stand there and never take your order.  I have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all.  Not sure where they go. They tend to always put way too many raw onions in the burritos.  If you have to eat here tell them to hold the onions.

Maybe the other locations are better."}
{"text":"Decent food to grab and go. 

Had one of those exceptionally slow and indecisive guys in front of me and the lady working there was great about ushering him along and getting to me asap.

The food is just ok - but hey, it's fast food. Salads are pretty big though, which is great!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem (literally - I had to ask the Excalibur staff for directions).  It's not easy to find a decent meal at a decent price on the Strip.  I consider Baja Fresh a decent meal, and prices are not marked up despite the prime location."}
{"text":"Went to eat at this location on November 13, 2016.  Arrived at 7:15pm and was told that they were closed because they ran out of chicken and steak.  Very disappointing! Don't really believe their excuse for closing so early.  I think the manager on duty was trying to cut some labor hours and close the place early because the restaurant was clearly dead.  Ended up driving to another Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Prices are terrific for being on the LV Strip. Meals under $10. Pass on the wahoo (ono) fish. The tacos I had would've been better with another protein choice, the fish was dry and maybe had been sitting in the oven too long. Otherwise, it's a great place to stop for a quick, affordable bite."}
{"text":"Like most airport fast food this place is no different. Ordered a two shrimp taco combo, and they gave me two chicken tacos with nothing else. I found out when I walked to my gate so I ate it anyways, the chicken was dry and nasty. Watch what they make you!"}
{"text":"The baja shrimp burrito is delicious.  The food is very fresh and tasty. The baja salsa has alot of flavor and taste good. The guacamole was very chunky and had a pleasant zesty flavor. The place was clean and the salsa bar was well stocked. It was very quick to get my food out and tasted great"}
{"text":"One of the larger BFMG's I have been to.  Due to it's size, I did not even feel the lunch rush.  This one is clean.  The food is tasty and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Quick and good
It is Baja Fresh.
For Fast Mexican food, it is good.
Had a chicken Burrito to eat on the road driving to Hoover Dam.
$1 for a HUGE tray of fresh hot chips!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a BF in probably ten years.  I came to the one located inside Excalibur casino so not sure I tagged the correct address?  We wanted something quick and tasty that was not greasy.  It is somewhat Chipotle style ordering where you go down the counter to add your ingredients.  I ordered the special steak and shrimp burrito while hubs ordered the steak quesadilla.  We were so hungry we added the steak nachos to share.  Boy that was a LOT of food! 

Everything was fresh and tasty.  I especially liked that they melted real cheese on the nachos and that it wasn't cheese sauce.  There is also a salsa bar.  

The people working here were also very nice and pleasant.  Average price will be about $10 pp so not bad for Vegas standards.  We enjoyed our meal so much we had to look up the one nearest home."}
{"text":"Not the same as I remember it.  I used to really like this place,  then they closed all the ones by my house.  It was OK but not stellar.  It's clean and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I love this location of Baja fresh. I always go here for their chicken fajitas. The staff is extremely friendly and they keep it very clean. The condiments are usually fresh, unless if you go their during their closing time. 

Also, they have pretty good coupons on Baja Fresh's web site."}
{"text":"I've gotten the bowl with the shrimp and steak twice, the first time it was delicious and I came back but the second time the steak was really hard and I could barely eat it. The portion is great for the price. I'd give it another chance but after that who knows?"}
{"text":"They've really stepped up the quality and service.  The fajitas are way better than other restaurants around ... Salsa Bar is awesome."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I normally do not leave negative reviews. I am an extremely laid back person who tries to find the good in every situation or person.  That being said,  here is my review: This is the only Baja Fresh location I have been to, and let me just say, the customer service leaves A LOT to be desired. The food is ok, I prefer Rubios, but every time I come here, the staff seems just miserable to be here. The girl working the counter today did not greet me for 3-5 minutes, she just stood in front of the register staring at her phone. She did not ask me if I had any questions, and no matter how personable I was,  I could not dredge up a smile from her! This is the treatment I get every time I come here,  no matter who is working, and this will be the last time I eat at this location. For overpriced and underserved food/portions, the least I would expect is good customer service,  or ANY level of customer service. Again,  I don't normally leave negative reviews,  but I truly feel the owner of this franchise needs to be aware of how his employees are representing his brand."}
{"text":"Yummy food, love the pronto nachos and I had shrimp tacos this time.. for the first time.  YUM !!!"}
{"text":"Just want to say we had some awesome food from them.. I got a chicken salad that was very flavorful and filling.. The chicken tacos are yummy but u cant just have one. But they are almost $3..
The staff was nice especially since we were there 30 min before they closed"}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh restaurant has a lock and chains on its front doors, and a notice that is permanently closed.  It was great while it lasted!"}
{"text":"Always loved Baja Fresh.  I do feel like it's a bit expensive compared to some other similar places, but I love the food here better.  I ordered the Nacho burrito enchilada style.  I always get enchilada style, it adds so much yummy flavor, and I especially like the chips covered in sauce and cheese on the side.  My burrito was huge and yummy!!  We were politely asked if we wanted some free chips while we waited for our orders.  Chips and salsa are great while you wait."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient. Ordered the chicken quesadilla :) pretty great portion for airport food."}
{"text":"Muy Bueno Mexican! Quick and tasty!!! 
This was my first visit to a BFMG, and I was impressed.

I selected their Baja Burrito with carnitas, served \"Echilado Style\" (topped with cheese and red sauce).  REALLY good!  What I loved about this burrito, is that they were generous with the carnitas (compared to most fast-food Mexican places), and did not bulk up my 'rito with the usual bland and boring rice.  Came with a side of chips, which were also Enchilado Style ... Ay Caramba!!  

NOM NOM NOM, Baja Fresh is DA BOMB!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good at all and a little expensive for the quality. Service was slow and wasn't much customers in the place. I ordered the choose 3 tacos. 1 shrimp. 1 fried fish. 1 grilled fish. The shrimp was alright but the other two were just horrible and chewy. I bet the fish had been sitting under a heat lamp all day had become hardened from being so dry. The cabbage they put on the tacos was tasteless and I ended up just scraping it off by the third taco. Chicken quesadilla was also tasteless with just grilled chicken and mozzarella. Didn't even seem like they used seasoning. I'm not aloud to pick lunch anymore. Thanks Baja Fresh!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Baja Fresh in general, but this location is one I have learned to avoid.  Last time I stopped by, I didn't realize they closed a good deal earlier on Sunday.  I saw them getting ready to close (they were still open), and asked.  I was answered very rudely by a very young woman counting her register drawer.  The level of attitude from this teenager was off the charts, and she had another snide \"BYE!\" as I walked out.  I've also noticed the A/C and soda fountain problems and weird opening/closing hours.  If you like Baja Fresh, go to the one on Flamingo and Maryland.  Quieter and service is polite."}
{"text":"Customer service is seriously lacking at this location .  Cashier checking me out wasn't very friendly and no \"thank you.\"  She was more interested in what her co worker had to say.  Will not come back.  Pitiful!"}
{"text":"Today out film crew ordered from this place. My salad was requested no onions per a SERIOUS allergy. My salad came with onions... So I called to explain to the manager as to why I needed a new salad. Ceaser Placed blame on our PA then hung up on me. Upon entry into the restaurant I was given dirty looks by the kitchen staff and not only did I not even get eye contact by the manager but he shoved my salad at me. Told him his attitude was wonderful and to have a great day... My salad is STILL wrong! They not only left off onions but EVERY SINGLE OTHER toppings!!!!!! I'm left with lettuce and shrimp for lunch. No money back, no customer service nothing. If this is how you allow your staff to operate I'm alarmed for this company."}
{"text":"I should have read the recent bad reviews before stopping in for lunch today. I used to be a big fan of baja fresh but this location is disappointing to say the least. First, I ordered a baja burrito bowl (which I've ordered many times before). It's basically a burrito without the tortilla. I received a salad - no rice! I didn't check my order until I got back to my office (ugh).

Second, I usually love their baja salsa. But the one I had today was literally 4 times as spicy as usual. I could barely eat it! 

My entire lunch was ruined. Won't be going back to this location. As others have said, it's no wonder they were empty during the peak lunch hour."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great staff. Manager is super friendly and talks to his guests.  2for 1 for teachers this weekend."}
{"text":"If you want great, fresh Mexican food, stop here. I know you think it won't be as authentic as the more authentic LOOKING places, but it's right up there. 

My favorite go-to-must-haves are the baja style tacos (two corn tortillas) filled with a fair amount of carne asada, mild sauce (though hot is available), onions and cilantro. Just like those other places, but they are always spot on with their deliciousness. 

A friend used to get all of his burritos 'enchilada style' and he loved it, so I'd recommend that if you're a burrito guy or girl!

I also usually order a small side of guacamole with chips, but man, the guac has a really bitter aftertaste that I can't take anymore. But definitely get the chips, they are salty and crispy and sometimes warm...mmmmmmmmm!

Also, the service is quick and friendly as heck! I love these people. They are on the ball and I've never had them mess an order of mine up. Super, super nice people here!

It's a little off the beaten path, buried in a strip mall, but pretty easy to find. 

I have loved Baja Fresh for a long time, they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"All this time, I thought Baja Fresh was a fast-food place comparable in quality to Del Taco- but then my office ordered lunch here. And my mind was changed! Their quality is higher than fast-food caliber, produce is fresh, salads are huge. None of these things I can say about Del Taco or Taco Bell.

Menu has tacos and burritos, nachos and flautas, bowls and salads- quite a few of them! Lots of customization options, too, and sides include chips and salsa, guac, or cheese. Opted for the Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad and a chicken tortilla soup- even though I really wanted nachos.

Salad was huge and fresh, tons of shrimp (8-10) with a tasty cilantro sauce and at least half of an avocado. Soup was a bit on the greasy side but had a ton of chicken and good overall flavor. 

Probably won't make this a regular place, but glad to know quality is better than their exterior suggests."}
{"text":"The food is much like most other Baja Fresh locations. But it feels a bit sloppier. And they quickly run out of things. Like being completely out of queso after only have been open for less than 3 hours. It also doesn't feel all that clean and has a messy floor and tables. And the salsa bar isn't well kept. The flat screen TV doesn't work, the cords were showing, there were holes in the wall, etc. And then there's the grammar error on kids eat free banner. It was just a sloppy location. Where's Undercover Boss when you need them? The food was edible, albeit not good. The pork carnitas taco wasn't very flavorful and the meat was too tough. The steak on the steak salad was fatty, really thin, and barely included a couple of strips. The tortilla strips on the salad was actually crumbled tortilla chips. The guacamole wasn't good. Etc., etc. And on top of the food quality, I'm definitely not keen on returning to this particular location."}
{"text":"Food was ok. But for two not worth $17. Lady seemed like he was in a bad mood and ordered wahoo bowl because of the mango salsa. Got my food did not have mango salsa. Asked for extra because they forgot and she said actually were out. Tell your customers before they pay! Not after you gave them their food!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is bland at best.  Angelica isn't someone who should be working at the front counter.  She was uninterested and was more concerned with interrupting us more than taking our order.  We would ask a question and she'd interrupt \"We're out of that\". They were out of drinks and salsa.  In the middle of ordering she'd stop listening to us and completely turn around and have a conversation with another employee.  What's worse is I'm pretty sure the owner was sitting on a chair at the end of the counter doing the stats for the day.

UPDATE: We got our food.  If this had been our first time to Baja Fresh we would never come back.  The food was bad.  The grilled fish was so hard it was as tough as jerky. The beans weren't even cooked through.  They were still dry and nasty.  The tortillas on my tacos felt like they've been left out all day.  We will never come back to this location again.  Horrible representation of the Baja Fresh franchise."}
{"text":"The food is Great And Great service Jose Medina is a Super Nice Man GM but the Air conditioning  doesn't work it a 100 degrees inside the restaurant and the out side temperature is 115 degrees.i would come back to this location in the fall when it cools down out side"}
{"text":"I've had their tacos before.  Never did I not like them.  Tonight I went in again after months and just snacked on the steak taco Baja style.  

Yum.

Came with chips and they have plenty of salsas to choose from.  Love that.  Also LOVE that they have free wi-fi.
:D"}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The food was actually really good and the salsa bar was stocked and very fresh! Fresh is a great word to describe Baja Fresh. Well for the items I had anyway. They have a fresh salsa bar, with 6 different salsas ranging from hot to mild, as well as jalapenos, limes and cilantro. I really enjoyed the mango salsa the best. It had bright, citrusy flavors that danced on my tongue. This was nothing like the jarred mango salsa you can find at the grocery store drowning in artificial flavorings and syrups. This was fresh made salsa and it was gooooood. The other salsa I liked was the baja salsa. It was a dark green and had a very good flavor. I stocked up on both of these.

I was in the mood for a burrito or tacos, but the grilled shrimp chile lime salad caught my eye. It's described on the menu as: fresh (there's that word again) salad greens and kale, pico, onion, bell pepper, jicama and tortilla strips, with fresh (and again) avocado and anejo cheese. All tossed in a chile lime dressing. This salad was amazing. The shrimp were grilled nicely, the veggies were crisp and that dressing was light and flavorful. That was a fresh (told ya) and filling salad. I also got a side of tortilla chips and small guacamole for only $2.99. I mostly got the chips to dip in the different salsas, but the guacamole was tasty. I can't say if I would come here for Mexican food, but I will certainly come back for that delicious fresh (haha) salad."}
{"text":"Over the five days we were in Vegas, we ate here three times.  It was THAT good.  I had the \"build a bowl\" and it was like a Mexican salad.  I got chicken, limes, rice, pico, salad and avocado.  The entree came with chips and salsa. They are located next to the Dick's Last Resort. I wish they would come to Texas soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food here. The chefs work hard all day and you are able to see them prepare and cook the food which is really cool. I've come here quite often and the chefs truly do work very hard. They have a very friendly staff and everything tastes great!"}
{"text":"Baja Fresh Mexican Grill,Excalibur Hotel,L.V.,N.V.
 If ya haven't visited \"Baja Fresh\" you should! Simple bright flavours of traditional Mexico made fresh & fast. Awesome self-serve condiment bar with your choice a salsas including Tomatillo, mole,guacamole,ranchero and a variety of peppers from hell-hot Haberneros to mild jalapenos. You should Go!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place.  It's in a good location, my fiancé is a fan, and they have a fresh salsa bar.  Nomz.

If you like spicy, give the Diablo Burrito a try.  I was weeping tears of spicy joy halfway through.  It's pretty intense.  If you like cheese, definitely try the Nacho Burrito.  Too cheesy for me, but I'm sure it will appeal to the cheese-friendly!

By far the steak is my favorite meat to pick here.  Their steak tacos, while simple, are very full of flavor and I often get these when I can't figure out what I want.  I hate being that guy that stares at the menu for 10 minutes.

For making food to order they are pretty fast to get it out!  I've never been here when it's really busy, usually just one or two people ahead of me, so I'm not sure if that rings true during other times.

They also have coupons in the local ads from your mailbox, so that's a nice bonus.  =)"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and requested to add veggies. The lady misunderstood me when I asked her how much extra it would be to add it. So she make a plain veggies quesadilla instead but I went ahead and paid for chicken. I did not realize this until I started eating. So I went back to requested a refund for the difference which would have been about $3. The manager came out she was kind and very understanding. To my surprise she comp. my food and gave me a full refund back on my card. She even gave me her number in case there is an an issue with the refund. Thank you Ms. Darlene T. at Las Vegas airport terminal D for coming out quickly and address this minor issue professionally. Happy customer."}
{"text":"I ordered another Steak Fajitas and as usual it was very good, as were the rice and the3 black beans. The bell peppers and the onions were great."}
{"text":"Located inside the Texas Station food court, this is one of my go-to spots for lunch since it's located fairly close to where I work. There's never a line and food always comes out fresh. Like any other Baja Fresh location they provide a self serve salsa bar. 

My only issue with this location is that they don't accept gift cards, citing that their \"system is still down\". Really? For months on end it's always out? How come no other location has issues? I'm sure they're just lying about it being down because they just don't want to accept them, but then why not just tell me that you don't accept them instead of making up an excuse?

That being said, I've never had any issues with the food here and continue to come back if I feel like grabbing Baja during my work day. Be sure to sign up for their e-club to get occasional coupons, as well as a coupon for a free burrito for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Baja is one of the better chain fast food Mexican style joints. We love their Burrito Ultimo and it's a decent size for about $8. Both the carnitas and steak are very tender, and I like how they grill the burrito after its wrapped. The tortillas are nice and chewy; love the texture!

Don't forget to ask for free chips and get lots of salsa at their bar. I like the verde the best.

Also sign up for their birthday club and get a free burrito for your birthday with a purchase of a large drink! If you keep the cup, refills are $0.99 for as long as you have the cup."}
{"text":"I get the same thing pretty much every time I come here, and to be honest I come very often. I always get a chicken Cesar salad burrito. This location lacks consistency.... My food never taste the same and it never even has the same ingredients , and I have to say the same for the customer service. Sometimes I get someone really nice and sometimes I get someone that doesn't seem to interested in what they are doing... I usually like to come here on Sunday's because the store next to them is closed. I want to give them more starts because when they get it right it's delicious but it's one of those things whenever I order that burrito I don't know if it's going to taste good or bad."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, especially if you are staying in Excalibur. This is near the pool so it is a great choice if you want to eat somewhere other than the place near the pool. I got a quesadilla and it was really good. This is really convenient to those who stay in Tower II, but not as close for others. 
There is also an area with tabels, and I never saw it too crowded."}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh establishment is in the Excalibur Hotel. We ate here on our last day in Vegas. I love Baja Fresh and we were excited to see one in our hotel. (It's located upstairs) I always get their Burrito Ultimo! It's fast and cheap, and they don't use lard, either! Their fish tacos are bomb and their brown looking salsa is my absolute favorite! Mmmm, I should have Baja Fresh for lunch tomorrow! :-)"}
{"text":"We REALLY enjoyed this place! The food quality was great! Very tasty and made fresh! Nothing sitting in a bin to be scooped out. They made it quickly, after we ordered. I'll be back and I recommend this place! The staff was very pleasant too!"}
{"text":"If you like stinky-smelly-dirty food then sure you can eat here. The food has no flavoring and the order is put together super sloppy. I asked for guacamole & sour cream on my burrito and she said I choose the Mexican burrito so I can't add it. Before paying for my food I had to ask the cashier to give me a side of guacamole...Drama! The burrito was so nasty I just are some of the tortilla and was done."}
{"text":"I used to come here multiple times a week but ever since they got new management, the quality of the food has gone down."}
{"text":"I placed an order for this location at 11 am for a pickup at 5:30 pm with Liz (who is apparently the manager) and when I came to pick up the order it wasn't even ready. The guy who was working had no idea there was an order even placed. Not his fault that his \"manager\" didn't relay the message to
Him. But it's alllll about communication. If you place an order I recommend confirming before driving to get it. Thanks to the guy for handling the situation fast and getting the order started ASAP"}
{"text":"After sadly leaving Vegas ;( early morning hours the only food places that were open was Burger King...gross! And Starbucks! But unfortunately I didn't think about having one of their breakfast sandwiches until after I got my coffee. After looking behind me though the line was just too long to wait...Again. Sooo I proceeded on to Baja Fresh. Something told me to continue on past them. As it was there was no Welcome anything...aka Good morning; Can I take your order? Nothing! I just got this side ways look from the lady behind the counter like, Ok, I'm ready whenever you are!? My tragic unfortunate experience of their tasteless Huervos Rancheros burrito for like $11 bucks was you guessed it...Disgusting!!! Everything about it was luke warm & nasty! The cheese wasn't melted nor were their potatoes cooked. It felt like I was chomping on beef jerky. Even the flour tortilla was rubbery!? All in all I was better off waiting in that long ass line back @ Starbucks...moral of the story."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh, more like Baja garbage disposal and swept up floor stuff wrapped in a tortilla!

Baja Fresh's name is only appropriate if its opposite day.

They even put hydrogenated oils in the kids meals and the guacamole.

I wrote them an email telling them how wrong that is. 

They wrote me a semi defensive/aggrasive email back saying it gives a consistensy customers want.

Nice try to make it seem like people want it.

If they were aware of what it does to your body they wouldnt care about the stupid benefit of consistency.

I hate you Baja Garbage"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Baja fresh in the area. They even delivered our food to our table."}
{"text":"I eat here when I need a quick Mexican fix in the food is always good and fresh. The staff is always pleasant and helpful and the salsa bar is always clean well stocked and appetizing. Pricing is fair in flavor plentiful."}
{"text":"I eat there rarely but many people from my office frequent there. A few months ago a coworker had a bug, alive, in her salad! While it is gross, I assumed, things happen, it's fresh ingredients and it was months ago... I just got my salad, BUG! It was dead but still disgusting!! I'm sick to my stomach. Yuk! 
The people who work there are polite and the front always looks clean but I'm never going back."}
{"text":"The average order for two people will probably hit somewhere around $20-22, depending on the type of burrito you choose, and if you get drinks (you'll need them, especially if you get a spicier item). I had the Nacho Burrito, which was incredibly spicy (they warn you), but also fairly yummy. Boyfriend ate the Ultimo Burrito and enjoyed it as well. 

All in all, no, these are the most flavorful burritos in the world, but they're cooked fast, are incredibly filling, and are about the cheapest food item you'll be able to find within the Excalibur (save for a couple of choices in the Food Court upstairs, but unless you want to eat McDonald's every night of your trip... well, you get the idea).

The burritos themselves are massive, and come with tortilla chips. You can then choose from a variety of salsas and such to make the meal complete - the Mango salsa is a nice combo of sweet and spicy, if you're willing to try something different.

For someone staying in Tower II, this is the closest actual food joint you'll come across, so bonus points for location."}

{"text":"Slick & quick.

I only had a taco & a churro, but both were just fine for an \"on the go\" snackfest..."}
{"text":"Use to love this place and the salads as well. Wife and I went to order a side by side and a steak bowl which I never had before. It actually tasted very good ! When I got home that day, my stomach started to roll. This was the beginning of something bad. Food poison !!  First it was diarreah  and then the vomiting. Good thing I saved my receipt. I don't care about a refund. Just need to warn corporate of their food preparation and food storage."}
{"text":"Its located inside Boca Park which is convenient (shopping at Target can really work up an appetite) I brought my 7 year old here on a lunch date and I was pretty disappointed. The food is kind of just thrown on the plate and covered in tomatoes. My daughter even said she didn't like it and she loves Mexican food and tomatoes. The cashier was nice but the manager seems to need an attitude adjustment. For a salad and kids meal 14 bucks seems pretty steep considering its not that great. The only plus is shaded out door seating that my dog seems to enjoy. I wont be wasting my money here again and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"I FOUND A COCKROACH AT THE SALSA BAR!!! Do not eat here. They acted like it was fairly common to see a cockroach in their establishment. I had to wait for my refund because it was on a card and no one even went to the bar to replace the salsa or even clean the bug.... 

I normally don't review chains like this but I had to let my fellow yelpers to avoid this dirty place!"}
{"text":"I had one grilled fish taco and one crispy fish taco. They cooked them fresh for me. I thought they were a little small for what you paid but it is airport pricing. ID definitely recommend the grilled over the crispy."}
{"text":"Great prices considering its on the Strip! For the spicy salsa lovers their salsa is actually good! Steak tacos were pretty good."}
{"text":"OMG if I could give this place negative stars I would. I work close to Boca park and wanted to try something I hadn't had in a while for lunch. I was so happy for this meal and it changed quickly lol. Let's just say I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN !!! I placed my order over the phone for myself and 2 other coworkers. I asked for no guacamole on one order due to my coworker being allergic to tomatoes. Never once did I hear \" there are no tomatoes in the guacamole \" ... I get there and I inform the manager (TERESA SANDOVAL WHO LIED AND TOLD ME HER LAST NAME WAS SOMETHING ELSE LOL NOT KNOWING ITS PRINTED ON MY RECEIPT ) that we were paying separately... It slipped my mind when I made the order to specify that so I didn't think it would be a big deal to correct this. She told me that she was unable to split the order and we had to pay for it in full with either cash or one card. I told her I was sorry but I needed it separate... she then went on to explain the voiding process and how she could not do it. I just stood there and finally after her huffing and puffing and eye rolling she voided the order and rang us separately.... once she showed me the order for my co worker who was allergic to tomatoes all I saw was a ton of tomatoes right on top. I asked her if she could remove that because I called stating I wanted no gauc due to the allergy, she then at that point raised her voice to tell me that gauc doesn't have tomatoes... at this point I was completely over this visit. I told her That's fine about the gauc not having tomatoes but I just wanted the tomatoes removed. TERESA SANDOVAL then took the tray because this was a tostada and threw it on the rack where the chef was, I asked her if throwing my food that way was necessary and she said yes ! Lol I was so appalled! I will never in life eat at this place again !!!!!!!!! NEGATIVE STARSSSSS !!!!!!! Also by the time my coworker got to eat this tostada the shell tasted like old old grease."}
{"text":"This place really came in handy when we got back from a day on the strip tired and hungry. Open 24hrs and at regular menu price not the inflated prices other restaurants in Vegas are charging and the food is good like really GOOD.  Splurge on that side of guac its deliciousl."}
{"text":"Reviewer # 35. 

 I am someone who primarily eats protein and veggies; therefore, Baja Fresh is an excellent choice. I ate there twice while staying at Excalibur Hotel and Casino, which made it very convenient-- open 24 hours, too as it is located right inside the hotel doors near the Resort Tower entrance near the pool area. 

The first night I didn't go there, food was brought up to me by my boyfriend. It was chicken fajitas and they were of good quality, taste and flavor, and a great temperature. It is Vegas, and this location is located in a hotel on the strip, therefore the prices are high, but that's to be expected. 

The next night I went down late night and visited the location personally. There were a few transients there asking me for money, which again-- it's Vegas, and many drunk people passing out while they eat (people watching is fun)... I rather enjoyed the ambiance of the place. The people were friendly and the service was quick and good quality as well. 

I became the duke while I was there with only two check-ins. I thought that was kinda cool. 

I wish my home location in Boise, Idaho was as friendly and superior quality as this home."}
{"text":"Their grilled soft tacos are so yummy! Also, their management was on point. They walk around he dinning area and make sure everything tastes good, offer to get you anything you need, and have a friendly smile. This is my go-to Baja Fresh!!"}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh is no better or worse than any other Baja Fresh. The food is the same as you'd expect. I love their Fish Tacos. The other items on the menu are bit uneven -- I've had some winners; had some duds. The staff is friendly at this location."}
{"text":"Girl at front counter wouldn't even lift her head to make eye contact, she seemed to be sick coughing in her shirt and hands then touching food. I just left the food there! Lack of staff as well"}
{"text":"This place has delicious, freshly made to order Mexican food! I especially like their shrimp tacos and baked fish tacos. It always seems clean in here and the staff smile and greet you when you walk in. So they have good customer service too. I love their salsa bar and usually order extra chips because that's my downfall!"}
{"text":"I like the fresh-mex concept. Its a decent meal when your in a pinch and want something light but fulfilling. This particular location is always clean and the staff are friendly.  The salsa area is maintained and free of spills and junk. Ill be back again."}
{"text":"I used to come here often with my wife several years ago, and we decided to come back from a quick bite, as our memories of this place were pretty decent for quick and fresh americanized mexican food with decent ingredients.  Our most recent visit was anything but good.  Ingredients were marginal, 'assembly' of the food was very sloppy, and all was topped off with a baby roach at the salsa bar.

Portions were absolutely huge, but I would have traded 2/3's or more of the quantity of the meal for better quality ingredients and preparation - the whole meal just looked sloppy and like a mess to me."}
{"text":"What happened Baja Fresh??  There was a time where I couldn't fully distinguish between Rubio's and Baja Fresh other than the green salsa they had.  I liked both equally well.  I grabbed a quick lunch from Baja fresh a few days ago.. and was immediately shocked as I came in.

They covered up all the calorie numbers on the menu, suspect. Also, the mahi fish tacos were now called \"wahoo\" fish tacos.  I usually ordered two crispy fish tacos, so I did the same.

The dread I felt when I saw them.  The fish used to be the size of something you would get at a pub when you ordered fish and chips.  It's now the size of a fish stick.

Yes.. a fish stick!!!  Looks like a fish stick, tastes like a fish stick.. It was ridiculous.  I'm now a Rubio's guy for life now when looking for some quick fish tacos."}
{"text":"My first stop in Vegas the Baja Fresh in terminal D.  Why I thought it would be a good idea to take a cross country plane ride without any snacks, I'll never know.  Desperate to get my blood sugar up and thankful to be off the plane, I made a pit stop for a chicken burrito.
I'm not familiar with the Baja Fresh chain, but this place wasn't bad.  The burrito was standard - rice and beans, grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato and cheese... I was disappointed that there wasn't any salsa or guac, but I don't think I really tasted it going down anyway.
Also - I'm not sure if this is a west coast burrito thing, but on the east coast we have steamed tortillas not grilled.  The grilled was interesting and gave it a nice crispness, but it didn't really say \"burrito\" to me -- it was more a burrito wrap."}
{"text":"Absolutely discussing! The guacamole was Brown and the salsa was bad. Customer service was terrible, reporting this place, the kitchen was filthy. I do not recommend this location, it's a possibility you could get sick."}
{"text":"Dear Baja Fresh,

Thank you for saving me from so many hangovers each time that I have stayed at the Excalibur Hotel in Vegas.  Your food is not so greasy that it makes me gag, but it is just greasy enough to soak up the excess alcohol from whichever club I had partied at the night before.  Thank you for making me quesadillas with extra cheese and for including guacamole in the price.  

I love you,
Courtney"}
{"text":"I am not 100% sure why, but I just don't feel like this store is very clean-- I haven't seen any evidence of dirtiness- just has that feeling.  But I keep going back because the food is good and is fresh. The staff has been friendly and professional. Prices are reasonable for the level of food that is offered."}
{"text":"This place is the shit, no lie. When you first walk in you notice that the cooks are grilling fresh chicken, steak, and I'm sure they'd pull out shrimp if you asked. The burritos are like eating at a taqueria in Mexico ... Amazing!"}
{"text":"I came to this Baja Fresh during a Thursday evening.

Atmosphere: Nothing special
Upon entering this establishment, it was almost empty. There was music in the background, and the place was pretty clean. The workers didn't seem to be doing much because of the lack of patrons present.

Service: Again, nothing special
I gave my order to the cashier and she gave me a receipt. She asked me what kind of beans I wanted in my burrito, I told her black, no complication there at all. No smile, nothing out of the ordinary that made it spectacular nor horrible.

Food: Bad Food, Bad Sanitation practices
This is where my visit takes a turn for the worst. I haven't been to Baja Fresh in a few years, so I was thinking that this visit would remind me of when I liked them. The salsa was pretty good, to be honest. However, when I got my nacho burrito, I failed to tasted anything nacho-like. I looked into the burrito and notices little tortilla crisps, but because of the moisture of all the other ingredients inside the burrito, they had lost their crunch. There was also a lack of cheese flavor; you know, the cheese flavor that you would taste when you have nachos. What really ruined it was knowing that almost half of the burrito consisted of beans. It was as if they added extra beans behind my back. Not once in my order did I mention beans other than when I was asked what type of beans I wanted. I know about food costing and \"dragging out\" food so that the other ingredients last longer, but this was RIDICULOUS.

Oh yeah, and while I was eating, one of the workers coughed and failed to wash their hands afterwards. How gross is that? If I go to a restaurant and a worker coughs in the open while preparing food I'm never coming back to that branch again. Yes, it was indeed \"cold season\" when I visited, but if you're sick, STAY HOME. 

Overall: Don't even think about coming here
This is one of my few Yelp reviews where I type in caps, but I think it's necessary to emphasize my points and feelings. The only positive thing I can say about this place would be that it was clean and presentable to the public. Unfortunately, their lack of sanitation practices and willingness to fill my burrito halfway with beans ruined my perception of Baja Fresh's reputation. I'm never coming back, and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"wow really?  everyone seems to love this place.
now i get it.  if you're staying at the excalibur i understand. 
convenience, price, proximity to elevators.
hell i even fell into to coming here as well.  but theres a reason i dont eat baja fresh at home and it became painfully apparent why i dont.
got the chicken quesadilla and it was gross.  plus for 2 of those bad boys it was 20 bux.  really?  ok......"}
{"text":"I've been eating Baja Fresh ever since the first restaurant opened in Newburry Park, CA. It's always delicious, even to this day and after all the corporate buyouts of the brand, ownership changes, etc. The recipes and food quality remain the same as they did all those years ago in the beginning, during the early 1990's. More specifically, this store in Las Vegas on West Lake Mead is my personal favorite, not just because it's now the closest to me since recently moving, but because of how incredible everything consistently tastes, the cleanliness of the restaurant itself, and the fantastic staff and service. Chipotle is great, but Baja is the original, and still the best!"}

I'm sure I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"I used to go here when short of time for lunch, but this last visit has really put me off. And it's all about the food. The salsa's tasted musty and dishwatery. And my companion had the same issue, so I wasn't just 'off' on my taste buds. And the crispy fish tacos, the size of a small fish stick, had this weird sweetness to the sauce that was off-putting. 

I felt like the computer that spits out the food to be the exact size, taste, and consistency went bonkers. It was all too sweet and too sharp. And the mango salsa resembled, and worse, tasted, like fruit cocktail. I think they had a microscopic bit of mango, but it was drowned out by the chunks of everything else. But the worst bite of all, was how soggy the peppers and onions were. They were overly salty limp noodles of yuckiness.

I didn't appreciate how true it was that the food tasted like the dishrag used to clean the tables smelled. And I'm usually a generous guy with cookie-cutter places like this, since I anticipate they are just a step above taco bell, but below, well, just about any authentic Mexican food place. But this place was sub-par today enough to make me want to write and inform others. 

And no, a teensy tray of generic chips doesn't make up for it."}
{"text":"We're from Texas, so we only got to try this place once while on vacation. It was worth the long walk, Baja Fresh didn't disappoint us. It's almost like Bullritos and Subway put together. You choose from a taco, burrito or salad. Everything is homegrown and cooked...well, fresh. The staff seemed efficient and friendly while making your order in front of you. Our food was still hot when served to us. My chicken burrito was evenly portioned and had some spice. It's too bad we don't have a Baja Fresh anywhere in Texas because we would go again."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is soooooooo good...drunk and sober! But it's freakin excellent when you're wasted off your ass! Honestly we ate here non-stop, those burritos and tacos soak up that alcohol and gets you good and ready to enjoy the day's events. 

We stayed in Tower ll and it's super convenient to that side...cheap prices, GOOD food, different types of salsa. Oh mi oh my!

Chipotle? chile please...Baja Fresh is where it's at! God I wish they'd come to Texas"}

{"text":"I was very happy to find this place steps away from my room when staying at the Excalibur hotel this week.  It is 100% everything you would expect from Baja Fresh plus addition menu items like building your own burrito and others.  Ate here twice during my trip and loved it.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"You know when, after eating at place several times, you start to get really sick of the food? Well, it doesn't take too many visits to Baja Fresh to get to that point. Although they do offer a pretty good selection of \"Tex-Mex\" food, and some really good burritos, the food here is pretty much the same as most of the Mexican Grill style restaurants around town. The atmosphere is nice though, a couple flat screen TV's playing some sports games and authentic Mexican music by artists such as Enrique Iglesias. The prices are about the same as any other similar style restaurant with burritos at about 7 dollars and quesadillas for 8 or 9 dollars. A couple things that I do like about Baja Fresh is that they give you fresh tortilla chips with your order and they aren't stingy with their guacamole, unlike Qdoba.... There's also good seating here, indoor and outdoor. For me, this is more of a place I'll go to when I'm really hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Used to love this spot but today Omg! The cook was in a bad mood and snapping at the cashier and kept slamming his hands on the table. It wasn't even that crowded. One lady in line just left, it was very awkward."}
{"text":"Definitely should have read the reviews about this place before coming to try and enjoy a lunch here. 
HORRIBLE! 
Absolutely horrible. 
The food was so disgusting. I got the Baja burrito with chicken. I wish I would have taken pictures but I just had to throw it away. My burrito was so soggy I could barely pick it up with out some kind of grease dripping down my hand. And the chicken was not even cooked all the way. Some chicken was hot some little cold. The chips were okay. Tasted very stale and chewy. As for the salsa, NO.  
As for the customer service big thumbs DOWN! Who was ever working March 18, 2017 around 4:30pm, has such an attitude problem. And she was disgusting eating her food at the register while she taking our order. That there in itself should have told us to leave. I'm at least glad my friend didn't get anything to share in this disgust of a good place. 

Just don't eat here. Plan and simple its horrible!! 
Customer Service- Bad 
Food- Bad 
Salsa- Disgusting 
Chips- Bad 
Seating area- Okay. Dirty with trash on most takes from previous guests. But we at least got a seat that wasn't."}
{"text":"Just fine. Not particularly fresh or flavorful. Chicken was a bit dry and veggies tasted old."}
{"text":"Quick and fast Mexican food their tortilla chips are not the best but their guacamole is pretty good friendly service at this location fish tacos are always yummy and their burritos are pretty good"}
{"text":"I won't be coming back until I see a \"under new management\" sign.  No air conditioning, drinks bought at counter were unrefridgerated, no ice.  Dirty salsa bar.  Half drunk bottle of Snapple in case with drinks for purchase.  Napkins kept in kitchen and not available to cleanup.  Dirty seats and tables.  Employee on cell phone ignoring concerns.  Food was mediocre.  Guacamole did not resemble anything fresh.  Dirty bathroom.  Bad dining experience.  Really too bad because I used to like Baja Fresh.  I have noticed quality going downhill, but today was the final straw."}
{"text":"I love their chix tacos Baja style with beans and rice. Chips and Guacamole are good, chips always warm and crunchy with a bit of lime flavor. Service is usually quick and Renee and Carina are very friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy coming to this location except when the heavy set mentally retarded cook is there. You have to repeat yourself at least 3 times and he still doesn't comprehend.  Very bad customer service, the cashier is friendly."}
{"text":"Compared to all other Mexican food places, this has to be one of the worst ones! Food was not good at all, took forever to get food (service was slow and not responsive), and the location I went to was awful! Never going back here again, not even if someone wants me to. Never need to experience service and food like this again"}
{"text":"Get a burrito and a soda. Stroll over to the huge glass windows on the left. Find a seat, theres plenty of 'em. Then watch planes land before yours takes off.  Super chill!"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Food is fresh and very tasty. I ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas plate. Highly recommended. Thank you"}
{"text":"I go to baja fresh all the time (different location) i happened to be on this side of town and love their food so decided to come to this location. They messed up our order off top and then made a big hullabaloo about charging us the correct price for enchilado sryle when they should have just fixed it. My husband had exactly 5 soggy chips on his plate with his burrito. I sent my tostada salad back because it was dry and lifeless with barely a sprinkle of cheese on it. I was literally grilled about why i was sending it back. I didnt like it! Simple as that. I could have made way better at home This location sucks and i will not be returning or recommending this resataurant to anyone. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I love Baja Fresh but this location has killed my desire to eat at any Baja fresh anymore.  The food is terrible.  I used to eat the fish tacos at least 2x a week, and I loved their burritos.  The fish is always either greasy, overcooked or mostly batter.  I am not a fan of cilantro and it's now overkill in it to where I can't pick it out.  Used to love the salsa bar...the roasted salsa which is supposed to medium has gotten so hot we can't eat it,  Basically they phased us out with substandard food that's not so fresh.  The cleanliness is another issue."}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time, and I loved it! 
It's ok, I can't say I will be running back anytime soon. I use to crave this place.   I'm not sure what it is that has changed since the last time I've been here.
I just can't put my finger on it!"}
{"text":"Not coming back at all, waste of money and time. Very disappointing. Dried tomatoes in my tomato salad, dried out salad, black guacamole. Horrible"}
{"text":"I work in the same parking lot as this restaurant & I've seen this place get shut down by the Health Department about 3 times over the last year or so. Each time the door had a note stating that they were shut down due to \"inadequate refrigeration\" if I remember correctly... I wouldn't take a chance eating here, just posting this because not everyone walks past this place every day and probably wouldn't know how many times they've been shut down."}
{"text":"I agree with the last reviewer, this Baja is going downhill. Baja was always  like the more beautiful, delicious cousin of Rubio's (if you consider your cousin delicious). I received my quesadilla and while it usually has a few types of cheeses in it, this one had some rubbery cheese in it with very little cheese in it, like they were cutting back or something. The queso fundido tasted fake, like a plastic doll accidentally dripped overhead into it or something. Ehh, I don't think so..."}
{"text":"Decent eats for Tuesday night bowling. Because Taco Tuesday baby! $1.25 for chicken or pork tacos. I'll be coming back for sure. Usually eat at the snack bar of the bowling alley but I feel better about myself eating here. 

Called in my order and picked up with no problems. Cashier could be friendlier but that's also irrelevant when hungry."}
{"text":"Not the usual quality of food. Salsa watered down. There is a store I eat at near my job with better food. Staff was nice. Store was clean"}
{"text":"Shity costumer service, no soup, and  couldnt make an order over the phone to avoid standing 30 min in line while staying in the hotel. The food was full of onions and tomatoes our entire room smelled like onion, it was horrible waste of money and time. They're so called burritos and tacos had no Flavor or meat..."}
{"text":"Fresh may be a bit of an overstatement. I got a veggie burrito which at most places cant be screwed up. Out of all my burrito experience, this as at the bottom. 

The rice was mushy and not ricey. The \"hot\" salsa had a nonexistent flavor and the whole thing was a floppy disappointment. I should have remembered the Quizno's around the corner.

Maybe, if you are super hung over and all you need is a bad burrito, give it a shot. I (for any state I am in) will choose a delicious veggie sandwich from Quizno's instead."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service was atrocious.  The two employees did not acknowledge my presence for what felt like five minutes when I was the only person in line. Then when I asked to only have black beans on my burrito instead of pinto I was met with severe attitude.  I then asked if I could have salsa on my burrito and was brushed off with \"it's already on there\". What? I just watched you make this stupid burrito and I can assure you sir there is no salsa. Disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good hearty meal and don't want to get raped by the diner prices on this side of the strip, then Baja Fresh is the hidden little gem in the back of the Excalibur. Don't miss out on the mango salsa at the salsa bar! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Horrendous. I ordered tacos that took 20 minutes to make and 4 people after me were served before me. Employees gossip and talk amongst themselves... and they take their sweet ass time.. don't they know we're in an airport and people have a flight to catch?! Not only was the wait unnecessarily long, my food was cold and definitely far from fresh. Fish was stale. Worst part was when the older cashier woman leaned over to put the lid on my tray and rubbed her dirty a$s shirt all over my food. Lost my appetite instantly but couldn't complain because I had to board in 10 minutes. I couldn't finish the food. Both of the women working there (the older cashier lady and Asian chick making the food) were far from friendly too."}
{"text":"Tasteless burrito. I'm not picky, but the food is not good. The 2nd star is only because the Churro is quite good."}
{"text":"Well not what I expected. I heard some really good things from friends about this place so I decided to try it and I was disappointed..... however the salsa bar is amazing I love the selections. The food is ok for the type of place it is I definitely would not go back again but I'm glad I at least can say that I tried it. I had the steak nachos. There was tons of chips of course and right in the center of it was a spoon of being a few pieces of steak, pico, sour cream, and jalapenos really hate when nachos are not spread out evenly so you really can't even eat anything but the center of the nachos. Service was good and friendly prices are decent. Just not my kind of food."}
{"text":"Usually I love Baja Fresh. This particular BF was really disappointing. The salsa was this weird watery stuff and they were out of key ingredients. Clearly under poor management. The staff were also inefficient and didn't seem to care much."}
{"text":"Always love coming here on my lunch. Food is prepared fast and delivered to your table, which is nice. The place is always clean, and the salsa freshly stocked. I've never had stale chips! Everything I've gotten to eat here is really good, but sometimes the fish is a little over cooked, the flavor is still great though. 
Also, they give 20% off to teachers! If you work for CCSD, just show your badge. I work for a preschool in the area and they gave us the flyers for it, which they let us use as a coupon. Love it here!"}
{"text":"The Best / cleanest Salsa Bar Everrr!!!
When it comes to Mexican Food, you gotta have Great Salsa or it ain't no fun 
What else you need!!! Bottomless Salsa every time 
They got around 8 different varieties of Freshly made Salsa from scratch all day long , I am just fan of this place 
As everything is so Fresh , clean , colorful...
Try the Veggie Burrito or the Veggie tacos but get them made Quesadilla style, ask them to flash some corn on top and your set to go with some fresh lime and salsa.
Endless CHIPS AND SALSA .... Chips and Salsa ... Chips and Salsa... 
The Service is Awesome at this location, every time they are amazing in customer service , I think it's a new location or management but it's definitely 
Not like Chipotle with their boring same items every time and sad looking Salsa...which they are stingy about."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is the worst service I have ever had. The cashier at the front had the audacity to tell me \"you better get water\" when I asked for my cup (a cup I purchased). Please see the attached image for an example of what I paid for. I asked them to re-wrap my burrito, as it was spewing beans, to which the cashier responded \"no\". I asked \"why\" and he said, \"it's the law\". Being in food service and food service management, I am well versed in food safety. As to my knowledge, there are no laws against re-wrapping burritos that are falling apart. After asking to speak with a manager (I really just wanted them to give me a decent burrito), he told me no manager was available. I saw a woman in more formal clothes behind the bar but didn't press the issue as I didn't know what position she held. After I sat down with my food I saw them point and laugh at me, and the woman who appeared to be a manager shrugged. People tend to forget that employees are people too and deserve to be treated with respect. I am a firm believer in conversing with workers and being polite versus belting an order at them. However, in return I expect the same amount of respect.  I'm insulted he accused me attempting to steal soda of all things (despite the fact I paid for a drink). This employee has put his coworkers to shame, along with Baja Fresh. I can only hope they provide training to their employees who lack human decency or common sense."}
{"text":"Stopped by Baja Fresh for the first time today. Place is clean and staff are friendly and very accommodating. We ordered chicken tortilla soup and chicken Baja salad. We were given chips while we waited and were directed to their salsa bar. Wow! The salsa bar has variety. I was tempted to get the bowl of mango salsa and eat it all on its own. It's that good! They have sweet, non spicy, medium spiced and very spicy salsa. 

The chicken tortilla soup was pretty good and for $4.50, it definitely filled me up. Added cilantro, some spicy salsa and lime juice...boom! The hubby's salad looked good too. They have big servings and low prices. We'll be back to try their tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"Came to get lunch for my husband and his coworkers thinking that they opened at 10:30am. Its now 11 am and still not open. I don't understand what business doesn't have hours posted."}
{"text":"Sadly, not FRESH at all on this visit.  Ordered a shrimp and steak burrito and both had old flaky crisp tortillas like they had been sitting around or re-heated. No bueno!

If I ever return I will be sure and check the \"freshness\" as they advertise and request a new fresh version.  I've never had this problem before it's always been fabulous so this was a one-time thing.

$15 for two burritos and they were not even 'FRESH\"?  Porfavor!

I frequent the other BJMG in Boca Park and always have great fresh food, so hopefully they will read this and watch the quality control."}
{"text":"Don't get the nachos.  They just use shredded cheese and pinto beans with a few toppings but no ooey gooey cheese:(

Service was okay.

Orders are fresh and made to order.

Salsa's are very tasty and a full salsa bar is available to help yourself.

Buy a large size drink and come back with your cup for .99 refills.

Baja Burrito is good but they always overheat the tortilla so you get a crispy bite instead of a soft chewy bite.  Steak filling was a bit fatty-I don't think I'll be getting this one again.

Okay place to go when you're in the mood for a quick bite of some Mexican flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely the best kept secret of terminal D, food-wise. Normally I'm not a fan of big chains - especially in airports. My past experiences with local Baja Sols have been all but pleasant, but given my options in LAS, Baja Sol is a winner.

For $6 you can grab a veggie-filled burrito that's semi-healthy, and surprisingly filling - get out!

Before we ventured into terminal D the food court options didn't include any item less than $9! And that was for a greasy, fat-filled grilled cheese.

If you ask me, this was a steal for decent airport food. And you know as well as I do, decent airport food (for a reasonable cost!!) is incredibly hard to come by."}
{"text":"Solid 3 1/2 stars!

I know Baja Fresh is definitely Tex-Mex but it's not so bad.  Of course it runs the gamut of other similar chains like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Rubio's.  All different, but all somehow the same.

One big plus of Baja Fresh is the tasty salsa bar!  Their salsa bar here is tops, salsa were are freshly made, the bar was clean, and there was quite a selection.  Besides their pico de gallo, their smoky, roasted salsa is pretty on point for me.  It goes with just about everything.  The mango salsa is another one of my favorites - sweet & spicy.

We eat with our eyes, and Baja Fresh definitely provides a lot of color in their food.  Our order looked bright & fresh!  Thankfully our items tasted as such:

-Baja Burrito with steak - melted Jack cheese, fresh guacamole & pico de gallo 
-Baja BBQ Chicken Salad - fresh greens with kale, onion, bell pepper, jicama, tortilla strips, roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes & topped with avocado, then tossed in a BBQ dressing

I had the Baja Burrito with the addition of romaine lettuce, it was big & hearty!  Heavy burrito stuffed with a good amount of steak & guacamole.  The pico was good too, and the burrito was made even more tasty with the addition of extra salsas - I tried a little of each!  Tortilla was warm and freshly made.

Wifey liked the Baja BBQ Chicken Salad, she opted for the dressing on the side.  It was used sparingly and gave the salad a sweet yet tangy kick.  She also liked adding some pico & jalapeno on her salad as well.

The great thing about Baja Fresh too is that with just about any main order, you get a bag of chips too!  Honestly, they make the salsa bar that much more fun.

We haven't visited a Baja Fresh in a while, and I forgot that with their large to-go plastic cups you only pay 99 cents for a soft drink refill on every visit.  I know at home we must have at least half a dozen of them!  I love making me some Coke with fresh lime, refreshing.

Keep an eye out in the mail for coupons at Baja Fresh too, they come quite often.  Our meal was a great deal, I think we used a $5 off $15 coupon.  Lunch came out to only $14 and change after the discount.  Value added!

I like this particular location at Boca Park, it's clean, crowded, and the employees are friendly.

Viva Baja Fresh!"}
{"text":"It's OK. They seem fast and friendly. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is due to the fact that all cooks left the kitchen at the same time while food was cooking on the stove. When one cook came back with gloves still on, not removed and than put a new pair on before touching food again, a female followed. Now I'm super nervous because they went to the back for awhile than a lady at the register put my order in a bag after a few words to the cook who finally came back. This is very unprofessional!! Never leave the kitchen!! Also the bathroom is dirty and disgusting. They don't clean it. I'm disappointed in this place especially since it's in Boca Park."}
{"text":"Your general Baja Fresh but way too expensive because its in a casino"}
{"text":"Back in 1995, I became a regular okay maybe an obsessive regular. I, along with my friends used to stack the 300 plus original Baja Fresh cups in our warehouse. If you don't remember those cups , they were made of sturdy plastic and were of the quality of cups you'd buy for your kitchen. And the salsa was thick and robust bursting with flavor. Then in or around 2002, they sold to Wendy's and almost over night changes were made. The salsa was thinner, the cups were replaced with flimsy ones and refills of chips went away. As they continued to decline in customer service and they were noticeable, my regularity too declined. Then I heard that Wendy's sold it to a private group so I eventually dropped by to visit in hopes of regaining a fun place to eat from the past. It didn't happen. It seems that they are watering down the salsa...stop it! Now I had the burrito ultimo and it was delicious. It wouldn't take long to bring back the glory of this franchise....."}
{"text":"Came here today and now know why I have not come in a while.
Ordered 3 Tacos, chicken with cheese only, came with black beans n rice.
Beans n rice were very hot and had typical flavor.
Chicken Tacos came with green sauce I did not order.
Chicken was warm at best and could not even melt the cheese as I ate the first one.
Tacos came with very little meat.....out of the 3 maybe had enough meat for one taco.
Food was brought out to my table, well after it was miss delivered to someone else!

Won't be returning as I learned why I stopped coming!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service.  I do not recommend eating at this location.  We ordered a steak bowl, which cost $9.79 (the receipt actually showed a Steak Build Your Own Burrito).  There was very little in the bowl - certainly not $9.79 worth.  When we brought it to the attention of the person at the counter (Irving), he rolled his eyes and called over his manager.  We showed her how little food was in the bowl and requested that they make a burrito instead, since that was the same amount as the bowl we ordered.  She said that the bowl was made as requested, and that a burrito would be the same amount of food.  She made no attempt to resolve the issue - but, instead gave a warmed up tortilla to go with the bowl.  I stay at the Excalibur frequently when in Las Vegas - but will never eat at this Baja Fresh again.  We left dissatisfied and felt like we were an annoyance to the manager and her staff.

July 30, 2016 - It is over two weeks since our visit.  We wrote to Baja Fresh, providing feedback on our July 12 visit.  To our disappointment, Baja Fresh never responded.  It appears that they don't care about how their employees treat customers.  Another reason to not patronize ANY Baja Fresh.

As of 2/3/17, we never received a response from Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Not like it! Terrible services Expensive and they charge me for chips n salsa even when they said is free"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Baja Fresh locations in Las Vegas. I frequently grab a bare burrito here after the movie. It's located in the food court in the Texas Station casino. There's lots of seating (but it's smack in the middle of the casino so you will smell smoke while you dine, yuck) and free soda refills. Their salsa bar is tasty too. It's your typical Baja Fresh food but I think the cooks here are better than at some of the other locations in town. Sometimes they run a coupon deal where you get a freebie or discount when you show your movie ticket stub from the adjacent Regal Cinemas so be sure to ask before you order."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is awful I haven't been here in years and it's just gotten worse.  Everything was cold and awful. No salt, no garlic, it sucked according to the husband. The meat had a weird flavor like canned meat so there was nothing fresh about this place and the none of the salsa was fresh or had even a little heat to it. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Umm, surprised there is no reveiw yet for this location!!!! O.K. anyways this Baja Fresh looks and feels like a typical Baja Fresh. You go in order, wait for them to call your order, get up and pick up your order. There is a salsa bar and you also get your own drinks. I have never felt that this location was dirty or too slow. Sometimes they get orders mixed up but hey we aren't all robots yet....
I really only get excited here over the Langostino Lobster tacos-YUM!!!!
Oh and I can't forget my favorite salsa- Mango Salsa-YUMM!!!!
Oh and one more thing they do have good Churros-YUMMY!!!

The churros are short and thick not long and skinny(sounds like I'm describing some guys at the club last night but I'm not...) Anyhow, the churros do have a bitter after taste everytime- but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying them.

So yes I would and do go back to Baja Fresh for my Lobster Taco,Mango Salsa & Churro fix...."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Baja Fresh...the one I normally go to is the location on Flamingo.  The Eastern location seems to be newer.  Staff is just as friendly here and the food is just as fresh.  Loved the taquitos and my husband enjoyed his summer shrimp tacos.  As always, love their chips and salsa bar!"}
{"text":"I love this place everything is so good and all of the workers here are super friendly \"Gerardo\" I think he's a manager is also very helpful and super nice! Love this place so fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"My son and I decided on  Baja fresh for lunch .. We  have eaten there before , I usually get the tacos .
This time I chose the steak burrito , unfortunately it had  very little steak , I think I got maybe three bites of meat ,pretty big burrito with a bunch of rice and beans .. This wasn't the first time this has happened my son ordered one  The last time we were there he complained  about the same thing , I just thought we'll maybe their having a bad day .. And today I decided to try again .. Never never again !!
Now I'm going to my little Mexican restaurant that's inside the Mexican store and have one of their steak burritos , always have lots if meat , not the best looking place but the good is awesome and prepared in front of you .."}
{"text":"Ok, so how do I start. Well, we walked in and were greeted enthusiastically. It was a really warm welcome, and we were happy to be there. 

I'm not sure what happened, but we did not get what we ordered. Yes, we should have verified our order with our receipt, but we have ordered the same thing many times. We wanted the battered fish tacos, but got the grilled instead. They were good, but not what we were looking forward to today. 

I love their salsa bar with the variety of salsas, Pico and limes. We got a healthy serving of tortilla chips. Unfortunately, I think that we got the leftovers from the previous day since we arrived shortly after they opened. They were stale. Blah. 

The set up here was odd. There was the main dining area, and then a whole other side with a soda machine and condiment area. Except, there were no condiments, and I'm not sure the soda machine worked over there. The ceiling fans were on high, and were blowing our napkins around. The music came on a few minutes after we arrived, and was way too loud. 

I believe our cashier was named Gregorio, and he was the highlight of our experience. Extremely nice and enthusiastic. Other than that, this is my least favorite Baja Fresh to date."}
{"text":"Great experience. The food was fresh, the staff was helpful and cheerful, and the place was clean. 

The salsa bar had a good selection, including two types of peppers. They also offer sliced limes. Glad we checked this place out. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love their food and quick service. Everything was fresh about them. We ordered grilled chicken burrito and grilled chicken quesedilla. They were delicious !"}
{"text":"Wow! I have been coming here for the last two years. Have had reasonable experiences. 
Today though, whoever is in charge of ordering for the kitchen has seriously fallen down on the job. 
Tried to order a steak and shrimp bowl. No steak. Ok ordered something else even though I was really looking forward to the steak. 
Then went to the salsa bar. My god everything was in a liquid state! I even asked what happened to the salsas. The response I got was \"we are out of gum\". WHAT???? So you're saying that the lack of actual mango and veg in the runny mango salsa is because of no gum? The smoky brown sauce is runny water because of no gum? The tomatio salsa is runny because of no gum? 
I thought Baja Fresh's motto is everything made fresh. Why on earth would there be any gum?
So very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"They have a $4.99 any burrito special with a purchase of a large drink. But they won't tell you about it, you have to ask for it or you won't get it. Burrito is filled with fillers and hardly any meat! It's sad to see business fail, but Baja Fresh is doing it to themselves. Go to Roberto's instead. You'll get what you pay for, lots of meat!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork carnita build my own burrito for my first meal at Baja. It turned out very good for me. Im a bit pickier when it comes to Mexican food ( with the last name being Hernandez I know Mexican food.) 

The rice was impressive since most places use a basic white rice to fill burritos. This one used a tomato sauce infused rice, just like mom and Grandma make so I was quite pleased. The kept it pretty simple, Carnitas, rice, beans, sour cream and a few veggies, stuff I grew up on so I will be def going back."}
{"text":"This is the only remaining Baja Fresh restaurant in Las Vegas, after all the rest of them suddenly shut down, but this was disclosed to me as I was making my purchase through Smiths @ Buffalo/Flamingo; which really ticked me off, because gift cards are not returnable, Smiths policy (WHY do grocery stores still sell gift cards to stores or restaurants when they no longer exist here?) When I told my husband about this, he called this location to see if they take these gift cards, the male voice on the line said that they do not take coupons (**why is the website still sending me coupons that I can't use anyway?!**) but they do accept gift cards (my husband did not get a name).

I wanted to use the gift card before this one would be in danger of losing up shop too. We local residents only have one hour for free parking, just scan your ID. The restaurant is located next to Dick's Last Resort restaurant. It is a big location (lots of seating). The menu is on the wall at the ordering side. This one has breakfast items and is open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. Order on the left side. You can see the food being prepared and cooked. Pay at the counter. Get your drinks on the right side, alongside the napkins, forks, etc. and salsa bar- my fave is the mango salsa (my husband said it was wrecked, so this area needs attention). The rest of the restaurant was clean and I did notice the workers cleaning off the tables that were used. 

We could not use the gift card. The lady at the counter said that it was a difference franchise and they do not accept gift cards. She did give us a 20% discount though (it was nice of her to do that, hence the 4 star rating). My husband did tell her that he'd checked by calling ahead and spoke with a man, but didn't get his name.

I got the carnitas fajitas (a good size- choice of beans, choice of corn or flour tortillas, rice, onions & peppers, options were: cheese, sour cream, and guacamole, and came with chips) to share with our son, and hubby got a carnitas burrito. Ours was good, but the meat was cold (it was on top), while hubby's was contained in a burrito, but he did enjoy it. And so did our son (he loves meat, Mexican food, and Asian food). 

There were 3 or 4 employees working here, I don't quite remember if we got a greeting, but their demeanor seemed to be that they were there, working, but really didn't enjoy dealing with customers one on one- no smiles, no enthusiasm. I would say that this area of the operation needs work. 

Has a good customer base, there were quite a few other diners in at lunch time yesterday. I wouldn't say it was crowded but there are several other options inside the casino, so there was a good amount of people here. 

((Side Note: It's sad that these restaurants didn't seem to last against other Mexican restaurants. Like Chevy's, sad face, another one bites the dust. It was on our regular rotation of Mexican restaurants, but these days my fave is Rubios, and hubby's fave is Chipotle. Rough business, lots of competition in the restaurant world.))"}

We are so glad that this particular restaurant revived from the dead chain of restaurants (we went to the Excalibur location, but that is NOT the same- my food was ice cold, not fresh at all; prior to that, we went to the Flamingo/Maryland because that was the closest one to our old neighborhood, almost on a monthly basis). 

We had our choice of restaurants visit on this National day, but we came here first to eat inside the restaurant; there is outside seating as well, for customers only (ok, we visited another one, for To-Go, you caught us, well, I am pretty sure I did a 'check-in'). Clean tables. (We recognized the former manager from the old location we frequented.) Just a few customers, besides us, but by the time we left, there was a line to the front door. 

I've had a lot of items on the menu over the years (and back when I worked in the area, this is the one we would frequent), the fajitas are the bomb-diggity. I opted for the carnitas ultimo burrito (meat, cheese, grilled veggies, salsa, rice & sour cream), comes with chips, then you select your salsa at the bar (you can also opt for pickled jalapenos, peppercinos, lime slices)- aww, no more mango salsa, which was my favorite, to split with our son. It was a pretty good-sized burrito, I don't eat a whole one by myself, ever. Hubby's favorite is a burrito. He always gets them. Anyhoo, the flavor of the carnitas was on point, not salty, or fatty, either, for that matter. It was delicious, perfectly seasoned. You know when our picky son is \"Mum-mum\"-ing, he really wants more (it is the only baby verbage that he uses, typically spoken at Chipotle, usually, a weekend visit). The only ingredient I didn't give him was the onions, like I said, he is picky.  

We will be back again."}
{"text":"A solid food option in D concourse of the terminal 3. You see ladies and gentlemen, on cross-country flights they don't serve food like they used to. The food to buy on board is not very good so come prepared. My recommendation is either head to a casino buffet before you hit the airport of buy something to take on board as that transcontinental back to the E coast is looong. 

This Baja fresh is a good option. Burritos are filling and give a good amount of relatively healthy food that should keep your tummy happy while in air.  There was a small lineup but they were organized, took my order and my food came out within five minutes in a takeout bag.  I had selected the chicken Baja burrito w guac. It was fresh decent filling and good size. Ingredients seemed healthy and a bit of Mexican seasoning. Overall it was a solid 3.5/5.  Price for value was adequate."}
{"text":"I like Baja Fresh, just not this location.  I was walking through the Excalibur hotel looking for something quick to take back to my room to eat when I came across this place. The guy taking my order was not paying attention when I was placing my order. Even though I was the only one in line, he was busy doing other things as I was telling him what I wanted. Not surprisingly he got my order completely wrong. I had ordered a Burrito Mexicano, Enchilado Style. He tried to give me a regular Baja Burrito. As I was explaining to him, and the lady at the counter, what I wanted he walked away again. I was then not surprised when he took that Baja Burrito and threw it in the oven with some salsa and chips to make it Enchilado Style. I flagged the guy down and let him know that it was not what I wanted. I wanted a Burrito Mexicano! He seemed annoyed by me, and I was definitely annoyed that he couldn't stand still for long enough to take my order correctly. It took awhile, but I was able to finally get my order right in the end. 

I should have known better than to go to a place like Baja Fresh in Las Vegas when there are so many other unique options available. Service can really kill an appetite, and my experience at this Baja Fresh made me lose mine."}
{"text":"After 8 hours of traveling this was a site for sore eyes...I had to eat here because corporate Baja closed all of the Chicagoland locations...I needed me a Chicken Baja Burritto.  

It was good not great...I am use to the guy cooking in the back and me waiting 10 minutes for my food...this place is more of an assembly line and I understand that because speed of food is important when trying to catch your flight. It did take me 10 minutes to pay...owner kept yelling in back for an employee to ring me up.  I also heard owner on the phone talking to somebody, he said, \"you need to pick this up...I serve fresh chicken not frozen!\". Good to know that I was probably eating the frozen stuff. 

The green salsa was also very neon in color. It tasted good but was not there normal green salsa...I think he gave me the verde salad dressing.  I still poured it on...yum!!!  What a way to start out Vegas for breakfast...I feel like a winner already!!!"}
{"text":"50% Fast Food 50% Sit Down Quality 100% WooHoo. Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Taco Bell. Now that I have qualified this, Baja Fresh has the Bell (Yes I have had the new Taco Doritos Loco, big fan) beat by a mile for what it is. At this particular location the staff is great. Sign up on the web for a free burrito on your birthday! Yes I said FREE (did I stutter?). Tell them the Duke sent you. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I love Baja Fresh, and was really excited to have one so close to home. But the service is hit or miss. Some days you get lucky and get a nice and competent person, and then other days, not so much. 

They also have some strange ways of operating business. Their hours, for instance, are 10:45 - 9:45. Maybe it's just me, but I find it odd that a business would close at 9:45 instead of on the hour like all other Baja Fresh franchises. And when we have gone early in the day they have opened up to 15-20mins late. Also, once you're inside it's not the most comfortable wait since the AC is broken. Forget about eating in with the summer heat!

The food we've had here has been consistent with other locations, so I'll still go here out of convenience when I get the craving. But I do wish the ownership/management would do something to improve service. As it is now, you get the impression they really don't care all too much."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Service as average. Fajita did not have enough spice and tortillas taste fake. Salsa, rice and beans were good."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a fajita  craving I end up here. Love, LOVE the chicken fajitas. Salsa bar has always been a favorite here and this location keeps it clean and everything is always fresh! I enjoy this spot for quick grab and go lunch! It hits the spot!"}
{"text":"For being an eatery option in an airport this Baja is not bad by any means. It's definitely a better option than the hot dog place next door. So if you're going through D gates, this is a decent place to stop.

For me the service was decent, but I'm also an airport employee. Discounts, holla!

I had two chicken soft \"Americano\" tacos. Normally I'd opt for corn tortillas, but for some reason this Baja uses flour on tacos that are \"Americano\". The corn tortilla tacos come with disgusting cilantro. Oh how I hate cilantro.

Overall, not a bad place for a Baja Fresh in an airport."}
{"text":"I haven't had Baja in awhile, but after the gym last night I was craving their yummy fish tacos. I've always been a fan of the fish tacos, because there's so few \"fast\" Mexican places you can grab decent fish items. Plus I do love their taquitos with the tasty cheese dipping sauce as well.

Unfortunately I think Baja has gone down hill in the past few years since its magnificent presence began infesting cities in Nevada and other places. Yes, it may still be \"fresh\" compared to say, Del Taco, but it is lacking.

I ordered the fish tacos, and was surprised they were so bland. I had to drench them in salsa (supposedly \"hot\" salsa... which was not... hot.). The fish was dry and unseasoned and it was like a long, stick of fish. It literally almost reminded me of putting a fish stick into a taco shell and calling it a day.

Why is the salsa bland now? Why is the fish not fresh? Is there a new CEO cutting corners, or is it just this particular establishment?

I don't know, but I DO know I am probably going to make the trip to Rubio's in Henderson from now on if I really want some good fish tacos."}
{"text":"I called in ahead of time to place a catering order for 10 people. I was promised that my order will be ready by the time I get there . I was 5 minutes late and to my surprise, they were not yet done with my order.  I had to wait an additional 20 minutes which of course made  me late for a meeting that I was bringing lunch at. So frustrated with their service."}
{"text":"I love this this place! The tostada salad is delicious;) They give you chips while you wait too, which is awesome as well. The staff is always friendly when I come here"}
{"text":"Baja Fresh is going down hill.  The burrito size is shrinking, and the price  is growing!  WTF!  Did they think I wouldn't notice?  I still like their burritos, I just don't think it's worth it now.  I can get a much more filling burrito from my friends at Chipotle for less $.  Oh and I normally like mango salsa but this time theirs tasted like dookie."}
{"text":"I love getting the mango chicken salad with a side of chips and guacamole when I'm short on cash. When you buy something keep your receipt. There is usually a coupon on the receipt that expires in 30 days. When I use it my meal only comes out to like $7.00. I also think their guacamole is the best out of all the fast food restaurant's also give you a good amount of chips and guacamole.  It's good for about 2 people with big appetites. The salad is also very filling!"}
{"text":"Decent prices for being in a casino.
Assembly line style (like Chipotle or Subway).
Behind the counter looked a bit dirty.
One of the employees didn't know what he was doing, and the another employee looked so frustrated. 
Boyfriend got a steak and shrimp burrito.
I got the two taco chicken combo.
Boyfriend said the burrito was decent.
Tacos were good, but the chicken was just a little bit dry.
Had a 10% off coupon.
Total with one drink was about $19.00.
Overall, eeehhh..."}
{"text":"This is pretty good for fast food! Fish tacos are about $4 each but pretty filling and come with chips on the side. We have tried tacos at lots of places in Las Vegas and although these are fast good, they are pretty damn good. Quite convenient too, if you're staying at Excalibur because they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I was able to get a side salad and rice & beans plate for under $5. It was a nutritious, vegetarian, and cheap. The salad was just romaine lettuce (not that shitty iceberg) with chopped tomatoes and tortilla strips. It was definitely not mindblowing but at the $1-2 range, I can't complain. My rice and beans plate was surprisingly large and in charge. However, the rice was bland but fluffy. The black beans (you can choose either black or pinto) are the real gem; they were cooked perfectly and topped with cotija crumble cheese. Baja offers a salsa bar and most of it is okay. Even the hottest sauce doesn't have that nice fire punch I was craving. The pico de gallo was unimpressive because the tomatoes were unfresh and mushy. But they have banana peppers and jalepenos. And a nice bonus: next door is a Starbucks so you can have a your caffeine midday fix, too! I know I'm judging a Mexican fastfood restaurant based on a salad and r&b plate, but hear me out, rice and beans are a simple staple, and sometimes simple is all I need."}
{"text":"I'm completely stunned... Great Fish Tacos in an Airport?

I was starving as I got off the plane in Las Vegas to attend a conference.  Nothing looked great to me until I saw Baja Fresh.  I was going to grab a quick salad when I noticed that they had ono fish tacos.  I love fish tacos so much that I was willing to risk a bad experience just to see if I could get a decent one.  Boy was I stunned when I found out that Baja Fresh has awesome fish tacos.  Served on two \"doubled up\" soft corn tortillas, with melted cheese, lettuce, avocado, and delicious lightly seasoned grilled ono, these were outstanding.  My only regret is that I did not get the triple instead of wimping out and getting the double.  The tacos came with rice and beans but I hardly noticed because the tacos were all I cared about.

I'm still in shock 24 hours later."}
{"text":"First, you should know this Baja is inside the Texas Station casino, in the food court near the movie theater. It's not a quicker Baja... 

Having said that, I love the food here. I really like their steak burritos, and their chips and guacamole never really disappoint. Their servings are generous, and I never feel like I paid too much for too little food here. The bang-to-buck ratio is good here. 

One of my favorite things about Baja is their salsa bar. They have an assortment of like 5 or 6 different types of salsas you can serve yourself. I like the pineapple one, though there's nothing wrong with the pico de gallo here! They also allow you to phone your order in ahead of time, which is a pretty cool little time-saver if you're in a rush!

The only reason I give this place four stars instead of 5? I feel like their food is slightly less awesome than Chipotle's, though they are priced similarly. I want to say Chipotle is better food, but Baja has more variety. If it weren't for the fact that I drive by Chipotle every day, I would probably eat more at Baja!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised w this one. Wasn't expecting anything great since it was in our hotel. Got a chicken burrito w fajitas, rice, guac, sour cream, pico, cheese and all 3 bottle sauces(mild, medium, chipotle). It comes w tortilla chips and there's a bunch more salsas to choose from near the fountain drinks. Great flavor although the rice is a little bland if you try it alone. Price I didn't mind Bc it's a huge burrito and plenty of chips so you're not going to be hungry. I believe it was around$15 w a fountain drink."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying Baja Fresh with friends. It probably could have been a whole lot better. We went at around 8 pm I ordered a veggie nacho burrito with pinto beans and apparently if they run out of rice and hour before they close they don't make anymore. Plus they don't tell you that they don't have any more till after you get your food and ask why there was no rice in your burrito. 
Like I said it probably could have been better if I was not so upset with the lack of rice and the extra black beans that apparently make up for not having rice. 
But from now on when I want burritos I'm sticking with Roberto's or a not so commercialized restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review off of two experiences, and one I didn't even get food. I had ordered through a third party delivery service where we ordered a Baja Burrito with pork carnitas, a Chicken Quesadilla and an order of Smoky Queso Fundido. When the driver got to the restaurant he called me and let me know that they told him that they were out of carnitas. He put me on the phone with them and the lady was VERY nice. She gave me three options, she could replace the protein choice with either chicken, beef or white fish. I told her I didn't really want the beef or white fish, but I could take chicken yet my concern was I paid extra for the carnitas. The next option was shrimp (the most expensive protein) and she was totally happy to do that for me and add extra cheese with no extra charge. She really made me feel better about my order and I was happy.

Unfortunately, the third party driver called about about 7 minutes later with a flat tire! Apparently it was in the stars I wouldn't get Baja that night. But it was alright, I made other arrangements and the third party company gave me a $10.00 coupon off my next order for the troubles.

So... last night I tried again with Baja, using the coupon so we got a little more. Exactly the same order as before only with some added chicken taquitos and a side of beans and rice. Since it was through a website, I called the restaurant and let them know we wanted extra cheese (no option on the website) and they were super okay with it with no extra charge. 

The food arrived fresh and delicious. The taquitos were still SUPER crispy and yummy, and they use real guacamole. My burrito was delicious and I absolutely loved their smokey queso (although for such a large portion we really needed more chips) I tried the quesadilla and it was good, nothing extraordinary (chicken and cheese). 

To sum it up, food was fresh and tasty and they went above and beyond for customer service, I'll be ordering from them again soon!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for awesome and fresh fast food. That had a lot of good choices.  The bar where you can add different salsas,   different peppers, fresh cilantro is awesome and fresh. Descent prices for Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the staff here! Always so accommodating to even the pickiest of orders and requests. Wouldn't go to any other location! Nacho burrito is definitely my favorite here with extra jalapeños!!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here. The burrito was big and good (could have used a little more meat filler). I also had a churro which was excellent. As you can expect it is airport pricing."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to see there was a Baja Fresh inside my hotel. 
Unfortunately, my craving for their amazing food, was left unsatisfied. The style of this location is very Chipotle like, their customer service was basic and the food was so unfortunate."}
{"text":"Man I loved this location and the food was always fresh.  Today I walked up to it with my order in mind and found a huge FOR LEASE sign up.  The place is closed.  Sad!"}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh is in the Excalibur Hotel. 

Staff were very friendly and helpful. Service was fast and competent.  

The restaurant was clean. There was plenty of seating. 

There were plenty of menu items to choose from. Food was fresh and delicious. My fave is the shrimp burrito.  There's tacos, quesadillas, salads and more. 

Prices were great. Hotel guests receive a coupon for a percentage off total orders."}
{"text":"The employes we're awful. None of them could smile nor would communicate well with me and they spoke like depressed robots. The burrito was good but, the nachos sucked. If you're alone with luggage and need to wash your hands your out of luck because there are no hand sanitizer wipes."}
{"text":"I don't know why all the good reviews and low star levels. Doesn't make sense to talk a place up and then give 2 stars. How unfair! This place is no different from the other stores in town. Food is always great and staff does their jobs well. I do notice the salsa isn't the exact same flavor or consistency from time to time. But overall, this place has great food. Thank you"}
{"text":"A nightmare! The guacamole was so hot inedible had to get and pay an additional 81 cents for a small dab of sour cream. The tacos were filled with a batter dipped tough piece of fish for spending 18.00 plus the extras not worth it. No one asked me or indicated that I would not be able to get rid of the burn-"}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming staff. Food is always great. I've been coming here everyday for the past month. Never get tired of it. They're always cleaning and making sure everything stays sanitary."}
{"text":"Wow, what an opportunity wasted by people who hate their jobs. \"No breakfast\". How about \"I'm sorry we're no longer serving breakfast, have you tried our ...\" I wanted to order queso, but apparently the breakfast question was too much and I was quickly herded down the line. 5/21/17, 12 PM Order taker customer service training. I'm sure she knows because he name tag is not visible-coincidence?She is the first person in the line and represents your business."}
{"text":"The best food option in the airport. I had the Baja burrito which tasted fine. Better than burger King. You get chips too but you must ask for the salsa."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars and that is only because of the food. The food is honestly awesome. I have had burritos, the americano style tacos, and more. All tasted great. The service on the other hand is very poor. I have beem here 3 times in the past 8 months and every time my wife and I have received horrible service. Last night was my most recent trip and the gentleman working the register was rude just like everyone else I've encountered. My favorite part is the delicious salsa bar they offer, but if you request one of the larger tubs from stack of 100 behind the counter. Every person we've asked acts like we are asking for golden covered little bowls from heaven. I even had one employee tell me, after I just spent $50 on food for my entire 6 person family, which included 2 large orders of chips. That we could only have one salsa container. So again and in short, great food horrible service. It's to bad because I work in a customer service and hold it to high standards. So for this reason, after last night, we will never return."}
{"text":"Great service & awesome food! I absolutely love their menu selection. The cashier was extremely sweet and helpful. They have an awesome salsa selection."}
{"text":"I had this for the first time the other day. I was told that things had recently been redone and under new management. As I've never been there I can only share this one experience. It was really tasty I had fish tacos and guacamole and chips. It was all super tasty and I loved the salsa bar. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating to anything I needed. I'll be back for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've been coming  to this locations for years. I stopped cause I can't not longer stand to the \"long faces\" of the people behind the counter. Angelica and Marta are always looking upset... I really miss Cesar! He was always smiling. Food here is ok but it needs an overall boost of TLC."}
{"text":"Bar far the worst baja fresh is town. Small portions cold employees especially the Hispanic manager who had an attitude about giving me more thank 3 napkins. No wonder it was a ghost town in there at 3 pm on a monday. They need better staff"}
{"text":"I will take Baja Fresh over that other place any time.

Any time.

This particular place is clean and friendly.

I personally stick with the orignal Baja fish tacos.  There is something about their special tangy sauce that I really really like.

I also get the express guacamole and chips - made fresh with no wierd additives.

The chips are fresh made, I can tell, and I'm so glad they do this.

Comfortable seating; an ideal place to have a quick meal."}
{"text":"All Las Vegas locations with the exception of Excalibur up and closed a few weeks ago with no notice to employees, etc. My understanding is that most employees were owed several weeks worth of pay. Here, even after not getting paid, the employees stayed and worked and this is how they are treated? (Same person owned all 8 of the stores in Vegas)

Sucks to work for someone that has absolutely not thought towards their employees and their well being (and no, I do not work for them)"}
{"text":"The food was good. I definitely had better. But you know these type of \"Mexican\" restaurants are everywhere and quite frankly it's super Americanized food but it's still edible food none-the-less. I got a chicken bowl...it was just ok...the rice in it was a bit crunchy...that didn't make me happy but who cares I was hungry! The salsa bar has a good variety of salsa and it was stocked well...they keep this place pretty clean maybe because they didn't have very many patrons besides me that day and there are plenty of seats if you feel like dining in. The service could be a little more service and lot less stale. Personality might help a little bit. Just saying. Y'all are lucky I was hungry and couldn't care less about how I was served. I'll come back if I ever feel in the mood for this type of food again...but I just found a Chipotle a few blocks down so it might be a long while before I'm back."}
{"text":"Sure it's not gourmet.  But I actually had a pretty decent 2 taco fish combo. The guy behind the counter was a little slow, but the food was quick and fresh and good.  Beans and rice were also good.  Excellent drink dispenser, lots of room and lots of seats.

When you are really tired of paying the exhorbant prices at the restaurants in the casinos, try something like this.  You may find a hidden gem.  If nothing else, it'll give you a quick break from the smokey casinos."}
{"text":"Sadly this place got me sick.. not once but twice. I decided to try it one more time more than a year later and of course I get sick again. Not sure from what particular thing that I ate. I'm disappointed because their food used to be great but now not so much. 

Not going back again."}
{"text":"No, Baja Fresh is not a 4 star restaurant (especially most other places), however, here it deserves 4 stars when looking at the whole picture: cheap, filling, location, yummy enough.  

Baja fresh is a lifesaver when staying near by.  It is a cheap option (for the strip), that has ok food.  It is great for those nights that you will be going out to clubs, the food is not too greasy yet is filling enough.  The guacamole is yummy and the their is never a line.  If you are like me and want to avoid the buffets, this is a fantastic option!"}
{"text":"I love Baja Fresh!  This location is smaller than the norm for Baja, but it still delivers quality food.  The parking is somewhat limited -- as it shares with Starbucks, etc.  Service has always been speedy and friendly here...so it's worth a trip!  Go Baja Fresh!"}
{"text":"For a quick and filling food option in the airport this was a great choice for me.

I got the Grilled Wahoo Fish Burrito Bowl with guacamole.  It was filling, fresh and delicious.  It took a little longer because the grilled the fish fresh for me - which I did not mind waiting the extra 3 minutes for.

Staff was nice and quick as well.  This is a small stand - no seating available here.  But I just took my food to the gate and ate while waiting to board.

There is also a Mrs. Fields Cookies right next door - so I might have also gotten a cookie as well."}
{"text":"Not happy at all with our experience. My office had a training video to watch today so the boss payed for lunch. We ordered online to go pick up and bring back to the office. You would think that ordering online the order would be accurate with no mistakes.....completely not true. Our email receipt clearly shows ready today at 12:10 pm for pick up and the order is exactly what everyone wanted. When we arrived the food was not ready and the person behind the counter argued with us that she said her ticket said 4:10 pm. So we waited a long time for them to make it while we waited. When we got back to the office three of the four orders were not correct. Completely wrong item on two of them and the wrong kind of rice on the other. When the office manager called back to tell them that they messed up the order and that things were not ready on time like they were supposed to be the person she spoke to was really rude. After stating her complaint the employee's response was \" well what do you want me to do, maybe go to Chipotle next time, I have customers waiting.\" SERIOUSLY!! Very rude, very inept. You would think that ordering online would remove a lot of error but it multiplied here. We printed out our emailed confirmation and receipt to see if we were wrong, but everything on there was completely correct so the problem was 100% on their end.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito here. It was decent. Not much to say about this place. The burrito wasnr exceptional at the same time it wasnt terrible."}
{"text":"Am I the only hater on here?  The store seemed really messy to me and my ultimo burrito (or whatever the called it) was soggy.  Pretty sure I could feed the burrito to my 5 month old daughter and her pediatrician would not have objected.  That's how soggy it is.  It's also possible that a combination of Cafe Rio in combination with the plethora of authentic Mexican Food in this city has spoiled me in regards to Mexican food.  The salsa was really chunky too.  I know some people enjoy the consistency of a good pico de gallo but that is really not my thing.  Bottom line is I did not enjoy my lunch here.  I thought it was over priced for the quality of what I got.  It's the southwest man...THE SOUTHWEST.  You can get to Mexico in 6 hours...you can do better than Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Service is pretty fast.  Nothing special in regards to the employee's I like the food.  I got a Tostada bowl, man it was delish.  I loved how light, crispy and airy the shell was!  It had chese, sour cream, and guacamole on it.  It's a very nice size, enough to split it.  I also tried there nachos!  OMG, I love nachos.  And these were enough to share as well.    I It's my new favorite salad and some nachos"}
{"text":"Yo.. airport food. It's not supposed to be good (well, it should be, but in general it's not.. you get it), and this is no exception, but I was alright with it. 

I got a bowl with rice, beans, veggies, hot salsa, and guacamole. It was all alright, only a bump and a hump better than cafeteria food. The hot salsa was actually a little hotter than a bell pepper, which was surprising to me. It had a decent flavor too. The guacamole was shockingly good: I got a giant splooge of it, it tasted fresh (even if it wasn't) and was really limey, which I'm always down with. 

A little less than $11 for a burrito bowl at an airport is more than fair (one star.) I also didn't barf (another star), and I was full (the last star.)

There aren't many options after 9pm at the Vegas airport, but Baja Fresh isn't a horrible one. Think of it as a middle ground between Taco Bell and Moe's if the Mexican \"authenticity\" chain is Taco Bell, Moe's, Del Taco, Qdoba, Chipotle."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at a Baja Fresh. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting less flavor from a fast food mexican joint, but their fajitas at least had some great flavor (at least with some the of their salsas on it). It was a bit loud in their and I'd probably go for Chipolte/Qdoba over them in the future but in a pinch I'd have no problem going to another Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is still in business. Ordered a ultimo steak burrito and seriously this thing was all tortilla that's like half inch thick I'll be taking my chances with chipotle from now on"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I always seem to have the same thing....chicken nachos.

They're good. I think they use tons of chips and very little chicken.  They could lighten up a bit on that.  

One thing I did notice today was how dirty the floor was. I noticed because cleanliness is super important to me. 

When the restaurant is dirty you're mind tends to wander on the cleanliness if te kitchen and so forth."}
{"text":"Every time I have come here I always get my order correct, a delicious tostada salad, more than decent service, and a $2 coupon for doing a survey on my receipt. The wait time is a little longer than desirable but for fresh, hot food this is completely acceptable. Their salsa bar is always well stocked and clean, and I just can't get enough of their black salsa. It's not spicy, it's just so good! I have not been able to tear myself away from the tostada salad yet but a few other things on the menu look good.

Honestly I am somewhat snobby about authentic Mexican food. This is not authentic, but it's still very tasty and that more than makes up for that. Also they have plentiful outdoor seating unlike other Bajas I have been to."}
{"text":"I guess you can't expect much from airport dining. If you HAVE to eat, this place is fine, I guess. Certainly nothing to brag about. It wasn't enjoyable or satisfying; it was just ... there."}
{"text":"Great food, hit the spot! Service was wonderful too! The gal got my order entirely right and didn't get a tude that I was picky."}
{"text":"What can I say about Baja Fresh? I used to work near this location, and as a quick place to have lunch, it was o.k. Not a bad price. Relatively good food, hot and fast. Pretty good salsa bar. 

Hadn't been in a Baja Fresh in a few years because there are more Mexican food places that I like much better, closer to where I live (like Roberto's, for instance). Anyway, on April 3, me and some friends decided to stop in to the 7501 W. Lake Mead, Summerlin location for lunch. Big mistake! Place was pretty empty at lunch time. That should have told me something.

I wanted fish tacos, so on the menu board there were 2 choices. \"Wahoo\" and \"Crispy Wahoo\".  I ordered 2 taco platter with Crispy Wahoo taco and one shrimp taco. After my friend ordered her meal, she was told that the \"Crispy Wahoo\" was not fried but grilled. O.k. I had to then make sure that the girl at the counter knew that I wanted fried. I asked why there were 2 different menu choices IF BOTH WERE GRILLED? I was met with the same kind of stare my dog would have given if I'd asked him the same question. From reading another Yelp review, this is an ongoing problem apparently. The menu choices need to be clear!

My order was delayed. When I got it, it was wrong. They forgot the shrimp taco. When I finally got the shrimp taco, it was cold. My friend's kid got rolled tacos that he said tasted like soap. So that order also had to be sent back. The general manager that day was grouchy and not in the greatest of moods. He acted like we didn't know what we were talking about. He said \"No one has ever complained before!\" Whatever. I got a new taco, and my friend's kid also got a new meal, but by that time we didn't really want anything else. 

The counter girl/server was nice and tried to be accommodating. The complimentary chips were pretty stale. The pinto beans, rice and salsas were decent. I wouldn't recommend this location and  I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"I walked in expecting freshly cooked food from one of my favorite restaurants. When I walked in the place felt a bit \"ghetto\" compared to the Baja Fresh I remember. Stepped on a sticky floor when I walked in. I purchased an Ultimo burrito and the chicken in this burrito was dryer than the desert we live in feel like they put it on the grill and forgot about it for an hour. I would definitely not come here again"}
{"text":"My flight had been delayed and I was so hungry because I woke up late and didnt get top eat breakfast. I walked around the airport and spotted Baja Fresh. I thought sure I''ll give this place a try other people are sp it must be decent. The best breakfast burrito I have ever had. I didnt even remember that there was no meat in it because the flavour was just so good. Everytime I spot a Baja Fresh in an airport thats where I'm having breakfast from now on. 1 star off because the churro they have me was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"It's pseudo-Mexican fast-food and all, but I really like Baja Fresh. Usually, that is. This particular location's odd, uninviting customer service has just about ruined it for me. They really don't seem to have a clue what they're doing or how to do it.
Not long ago, after ordering a taco combo plate, I had to return it because it was smothered in sour cream (for the first time in many visits). No big deal. Stuff happens, right? Well, everyone behind the counter acted like I was somehow at fault. The menus (paper and board) plainly list all of the stuff that comes on each item. Sour cream is listed in neither place, but they acted like I was being difficult for only wanting what was advertised on my tacos. \"No crema?\" over and over again. No...because it doesn't come on it! Granted, it was in Spanish, but the entire staff seemed to spend the next 10 minutes loudly debating the situation, the cook rolling his eyes and the server repeatedly checking the paper menu for proof of my mistake. Even on the 5th time, it still didn't say anything about sour cream. I will say that the manager did quickly step-in and tell them to remake my food, but even he seemed not to believe that they had messed-up in any way, that it was my fault. Eh, it is what it is. Everyone is entitled to an off day, right? Then last night, when my wife and I went back in, I made it a point to just go ahead and avoid any possible confusion by ordering my food without sour cream (that it obviously isn't supposed to come with in the first place). \"It doesn't come with it, sir.\"? Really? No shit? Well, maybe you should inform the rest of your staff because they clearly didn't get the memo. Anyway, when my wife tried to order a small plate of nachos, the cashier told her that they only had large plates left, so she had to order a large nacho instead. My wife asked why they couldn't just put the small portion on the larger plate for the appropriate price (It wasn't her fault their stock order was short), but the girl just smiled, said something that I think was mumbled Spanish and cheerfully said \"No\". That was that. Now, neither experience is some kind of massive, unbelievable offense, but they were both rather frustrating and, far beyond that, textbook examples of substandard, lazy, utterly unconcerned customer service. And with that being said, I don't really see us going back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating Baja Fresh and it is the best!! OMG the chips and fresh and the guacamole is sooo good. I really enjoyed eating here. I orders the chicken fajitas with corn tortilla and the chicken was perfect for being fast food. Totally going here more often. 

The reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is the wait time is a little longer than I would've expected. 

Will return!"}
{"text":"Heard of Food Safety?  Anyone?  I don't think the staff from this Baja Fresh have...

The staff making the burrito for the lady ahead of me accidentally dropped some ingredients on the floor.  One of the staff quickly grabbed a broom, and everyone came out to help remove the rubber mats off the floor while she sweeps.  Ok, so far, yes?  Well, it's about to get gross.

After sweeping and the rubber floor mats put back into place, I did not see any of the staff wash their hands or replaced the gloves that was used to handle the food earlier and the rubber floor mats.  Ok, here's the kicker...

The staff who was cooking the beef inside said to the other staff, not to worry about it.  She'd only do it if someone saw it.  Do what?  Like, wash your hands and replace them white gloves that's used to handle the food that you serve to people?  Oh, ok then...  check please!

That's just McNasty!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was BETTER!...the food or the service?

Every time I stop at this location the staff is just so welcoming. For a \"fast\" food service I wouldn't necessarily expect it but the people that work there must love their job because it seems apparent. They are so friendly, every time. The food is always awesome. Fresh and fast. Reasonably priced as well. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"The burritos could be a little bigger for the price. It is delicious and takes a little bit because they make it fresh. I ordered a steak Baja Burrito. Comes with free chips. The chips were fresh and light and non greasy. The Burrito shell was kinda falling apart. The Steak was moist and tender with a nice flavor. The Pico De Gallo was awesome sauce. Instead of guacamole there were pieces of Avocado in the burrito which was a nice touch. The Salsa bar rotates its flavors and had a mango Salsa(medium level of spicy). Buy a Large cup and get 99 cent refills for life. Cant go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review, but by the actions of the owner of the franchise, he turned a negative situation to a positive one. This review has nothing to do with the food. It's great..fresh, flavorful, salsa is perfect...I was in the mood for their lobster tacos. Was told by the order taker no lobster..2nd choice Mexicano Burrito w/ Monterrey jack and no sour cheese really simple order. Owner comes out says he's out jack cheese, needs to go to the store and will be right back. In the insuring time, they proceed to make up my orders. I asked if they had made my orders, she says yes. Says they will add the cheese later. Thirty minutes later owner comes back. Delivers the cheese to the kitchen to complete my order. Then walks up to me refunds me my $20.00 for the orders, says this order and my next one is on him.. Gives me my order, noticed the order has sour cream on it (the one I said no sc)...Apologizes, makes a replacement order. Walking out I get a call that I need another order. I order it..he doesn't charge me, unbelievable!! This guys knows customer service. This restaurant recently reopened after being closed for some time. I know this escapade cost him some $$$$$$. I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This Baja Fresh.... WAS NOT GOOD....

Only had whole beans at 5:30 pm????

Airport restaraunts are usually sub-par but this was BLAH."}
{"text":"Bomb food! It's open 24 hours which is awesome. The portions are huge as well. I got a burrito and my friend got a quesadilla. Chips were free and the queso is delicious!!"}
{"text":"it was good. service was quick. the lady making the food was very efficient. not even writing anything down. i got the Baja special or whatever it was. it was decent. i wished they had a salsa bar though. i like their salsa bars. the food didn't give me any food poisoning so that's always a plus. had we known beforehand our flight was going to cancel, we may have just held of from eating here. but, at the time it was good. oh, and we were way too lazy and my feet hurt too much to walk over to popeyes."}
{"text":"Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible Horrible que comida tan fea horrible"}
{"text":"I like to get real soft tacos when I come here they're delicious I usually get the steak ones with black beans I have a very large variety of sources of that salsa bar my favorite is the mango and the six chili salsa"}
{"text":"This breaks my heart because I used to LOOOOOOOVE Baja Fresh. We went in and the place was dead. Guess that should have been our first clue. I posted a picture because I'm sure that will speak volumes. Sad to say they are officially off the list."}
{"text":"For those of you that read my reviews... first of all, Thank You, second of all, you know that I eat Ultra Low Carb one day a week.  But, today I have guests from out of town, and when that happens, your diet goes out the window.  We were in the shopping center this Baja Grill is in.  And, even though I have tossed my diet out the window, I still looked for a healthy option.  And I had the \"Skinny Wahoo F.T.W.\"  

The food was great... Shrimp, with cabbage and a mango salsa... tasty and the spice was just right.  It wasn't over the top but just enough to make your tongue say hello.  My friends stuck with the fish tacos and they liked them as well.

Just to finish up my review... here are the small things that I like about this place.  Parking is easy - the restaurant isn't in the main part of the strip mall - bright and welcoming when you walk in - clean - and friendly employees that are efficient at their job.  A smile goes a long way with me.

So, for a quick bite at a \"Fast Food\" place, this place is great."}
{"text":"Passed through the airport just in time while breakfast was still being served.

Favorite for me is the Breakfast Burrito (Bare style: no tortilla wrap). Lots of eggs, choice of meat (some awesome bacon for me) and whatever else you like on top. Love the black beans, Pico, hot salsa and even some mild, sweet onion.
Delicious."}
{"text":"great kids meals.  super fresh.  mango salsa is the best and staff is friendly!   overall great value although pricier than most mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I walked up to Baja Fresh Express in Terminal D at 7am on a Monday morning. It was clean and there was one dude behind the counter. Being a daring eater, I grunt out my order: \"Breakfast burrito, no meat.\" He says \"Do you want papas (like on the menu) or do you want eggs, pico de gallo, beans and cheese?\" I was all like 'yeah whatever you just said I want the second one.\" Homeboy totally hooked it up.  The tortilla was so huge the thing was triple wrapped. A couple hours later, I was floating home over the clouds in a burrito coma. Damn that place is absolutely clutch."}
{"text":"I really really liked the burrito I got here! I got the chicken burrito and it was huge and very flavorful! I can be quite picky when it comes to burritos, but this place was not a disappointment to me. A great cheap place to eat in Vegas!

But be careful, my friend took the first bite of his burrito and it completely fell apart! Either he didn't know how to hold a burrito, or it's the way they made it. I'd just say make sure you know how to handle a big burrito :)"}
{"text":"I just left this location and will never go back! First the chicken in the Veggie Bowl was burnt. Then I took it back and she told me it's because of the sauces they put on it. I still wanted new chicken so they took it back. They brought me a new bowl and the chicken was good but the rice in the bowl was crispy like it was not done and it was very clumpy! To top it all off, I saw one of the cooks dig in his nose for a while, then started taping the register and did not wash his hands or anything!! My daughter ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was good but the beans tasted a couple days old and the rice was crispy too! The fish tacos were the only thing I ordered that turned out okay. That is why I have 1 star! The worst $27 Ive spent in a long time! I had to write a review! Never again!"}
{"text":"Worked for me! It is Baja Fresh and it is nice to have a quick burrito made your way while you are waiting for a flight. The real problem, however, is there really is no where to sit down and enjoy the meal. All of the seating I saw in the general area was specific to the establishments it was attached to. There were some standing tables nearby but come on -- so very close to completely travel friendly and very far away. LAS needs to change this!"}
{"text":"So bland. No flavor at all. I don't see how they can pass it off as Mexican food. Awful."}
{"text":"Went here 1/13/11 I had the chicken mango salad and it was delicious. I skipped the tortilla shell bowl and added everything spicy from the salsa bar and a ton of limes. What's great about Baja Fresh vs. Chipotle is the food looks and tastes better, and the salsa bar is free. Yum!"}
{"text":"Overall food and service is great. One problem. Way TOO MANY flies. It's not fun eating while you have to worry about flies getting into your food. Please fix this"}
{"text":"Baja Fresh having Grand Opening today. Loving the food!
Do awesome Custmer service, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Baja Fresh lake mead rocks! I joined the text message group and the email group so I am always getting specials promos and BOGO,s that really add value to the deal. Everything is super fresh always prepared to order on the spot and healthful."}
{"text":"We waited 15 years to get into a Baja Fresh. They don't have one in Baton Rouge. Julie had a chicken taco salad and I had the two steak taco combo. The food is fresh. Julie is all smiles!
  Worth the wait? Oh yeah! They have a salsa bar with fresh made salsa, including a mango salsa. Jalapeño and banana pepper slices too. Soda fountains with free refills.
  The only down side is they charge extra for cheese, not a big deal, and for salad dressing. We enjoy it every time we come!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, good service. What more could I ask for? Shrimp tacos are divine, and the churros are the best!"}
{"text":"When I was in Las Vegas two weeks ago, on my way home, I caught an early Hawaiian Airlines flight. 
Rushing out of my hotel, & returning the rental car, I did not have anytime to eat anything in the wee morning hours........

Lucky for me, the McCarran Airport's new Terminal 3 has a whole bunch of places to eat & shop,.........they even have slot machines, so you can do some last minute gambling! Lol!!!

After checking in at Hawaiian Airlines, passing the TSA screening area, catching the monorail to Terminal 3.........it was time to sit down, relax, & get something to eat before I board my flight home.

After walking around Terminal 3, I found this place called Baja Fresh \"Express\" Mexican Grill. It was a good place I could grab something quick..........food was edible, but of course nothing like I would get at a restaurant. But the convenience factor was spot on!

Ordered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's & two soda's.............aaaah, breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know, the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor, and probably the vendor's high rent, & taxes.

The food......well, the breakfast burrito was quite BIG, it was loaded with eggs, potatoes, & one type of meat. I ended up taking bacon for my meat. Everything about the breakfast burrito was okay, with the exception of the bacon which was kinda soggy & rubbery. If they had cooked the bacon to a crisp, then loaded it in the burrito, I'm sure it would have tasted a little better......but what do you expect for airport food???? 
It's all about convenience folks!"}
{"text":"Reopened in Boca Park as of 12.10 17. Go back and give them a try. The spanish rice is great. I'm not a big veggie fan, so I order a little different. They are affordable. Lots of vegetarian and vegan choices."}
{"text":"the food is good, the restaurant is a dump. They are in desperate need of a remodel. The booths are vile. If i was the mgr. I would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"WOW! My friends and I ate here during our stay at Excalibur.. 

Are you serious, Baja Fresh? Your burritos were amazing! I've eaten a ridiculous amount of both fancy and cheap burritos in the past... but for some reason - your burritos were just SO good!

I ordered a \"Build Your Own Burrito\", with Carnitas and all the works. I split a burrito with my fiance, and not only was it incredibly delicious - but I was really full off of my half! You also get some complimentary chips and salsa with your meal, so that will help fill you up as well.

My friends were just as amazed with your deliciousness, that we couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the night. Not only that, but your service was fast and friendly too...

Good to know! If we're in your neck of the woods again next time, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of all this location seems to be under new ownership/management. I had pretty much given up on Baja Fresh. I was going to this location and the location in Henderson in the past. The standards fell so bad that I was amazed they were staying open. Food was no longer fresh and tasted weird, salsa bar was disgusting, The restaurant was in severe need of maintenance and repairs. I though this location had closed for good but must have closed then reopened? Gave it another try tonight and it's like night and day compared to how it used to be. It now seems to be back to the old Baja that I liked over the years. Hopefully they keep it up. Many locations closed so hopefully maybe they focused to bringing the remaining locations up to par."}
{"text":"Sad face - I paid for guac and they didn't put it in. Also the food was not that great. I can compare this to Moes and Chipotle and say it's falling in-between but closer to Moes style food."}
{"text":"Preface- this is at the airport. This was probably one of the most ridiculous restaurant experiences I've ever had, and I try to generally be optimistic. There were five people behind the counter preparing subway style. Ordering was confusing to the guy taking orders, the next guy was in training or just didn't know english at all, cause the next guy was trying to run the whole operation and also explain in spanish instructions for everything. So there was some fumbling and confusion. There was a presumable manager just standing behind them, never said a word and didn't lift a finger. Workers were obviously stressed and people in line were frustrated. Food was mediocre, but still seemed like the best option considering the alternatives."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and overpriced. Don't eat here! (3/7/12)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's fresh and fast food.  I only really get the steak and bean burrito.  Burrito is good size.  Chips and salsa are great too and come with meal."}
{"text":"I like Baja Fresh's salsa bar better than any of the other burrito shops. They make a quality product and a decent price, but I think the size of the burritos is a little smaller than before. It is still a full meal, but I used to take some to go for latter."}
{"text":"it has been years since i've last eaten here, but i don't think much has changed.  their food never disappoints and the free salsa bar is plain awesome!"}
{"text":"Who runs out of bacon while serving breakfast? There was absolutely no sense of urgency while serving the guest. We were told that it would take 10 minutes to cook eggs for breakfast burritos, seriously?? Good thing there are so many other choices to eat."}
{"text":"I was massively craving Mexican food and I was going to stop by the Roberto's across the street, but the parking lot was too retarded to park in so I decided just to stop by here. I ordered a Diablo Burrito with steak and added 9000 jalapenos to it. It was not super spicy which I was craving, but it was satisfying. I tried the mango salsa with the chips which were pretty good. All in all a decent option, but I wish I could find amazing authentic local Mexican food here in Vegas."}
{"text":"All this talk about fake Mexican food and real Mexican food in Yelp Talk made me want... well... Mexican food.  That said, I wanted something fast.

My first instinct was to go to Qdoba... and I should have.

This Baja Fresh is always empty, and tonight was no different.  We ordered a couple burritos for takeout and brought them home because DD was not in the mood for another quesadilla (the only thing she likes there).

DH ordered the Mexicano with steak and I ordered the Ultimo with steak.

Portions?  Large - I couldn't finish half if I wanted to.

Flavor?  Meh.  Honestly, I didn't like the Ultimo.  I felt it was super heavy with plain tasting rice and I missed the beans.  I should have ordered it sans grilled onions because the burrito was 20% onion.  It tasted like a plain pile of mush, even after adding their salsa.

Pluses?  I do like that they give you free chips and salsa.  DH and I like different salsas there, so we got an assortment and we were happy.  The chips and salsa is the best part about Baja Fresh, TBH.

At more than $8 for a burrito (with tax), this just is not worth it.  I would much rather have something more flavorful at Qdoba.  

And, lest you think Baja Fresh is healthy, take a look at their nutritional guide.  This is not low cal (especially when you eat something with sour cream like me).  Don't be tricked into thinking this is healthy Mexican food!"}
{"text":"You most watch New 13, this Restaurant was shut down by the health district for inadequate refrigeration and further feeding their sabotage theory.
Do you you know what will you been eating here today?
Back in July 30, I was here and complained about the sauce flavor and they told \"you're the only person complaining\" well thanks to the inspector for doing their job."}
{"text":"The people who work here are extremely unprofessional. There's a reason why the place is always empty.

I've been here twice: once with my wife, and on the chicken nachos they put way too many beans and not much chicken at all.

The second time is what I'm more upset about. My wife put in an order through Paypal for two burritos, mine being the nacho burrito with NO VEGGIES. ETA to pick up was 10-30 minutes. I get there after 20 minutes and tell them that I'm there to pick up the order, and I'm met with confused faces. Serves me right for ordering in the afternoon and making the employees get off their phones! 

They go to a printer and see the order and tell me that it's going to be a few minutes. Fine, I brought a refill cup anyway. I went to get some lemonade for my wife and once again, the spout for both the Hi-C and lemonade are gunked up and there's no water coming out, only syrup. I tell the person at the front and she holds the button for a few seconds and water finally comes out. Really? 

I get my burritos and go home. Immediately I notice that there are jalapenos in it. Not terrible, but whatever. I opened the burrito to take it out and notice that the volume is almost all black beans, with NO chicken at all. Here's what is advertised with the burrito:

\"It's Spicy! Fire-grilled all white meat chicken, Jack & cheddar cheese, vegetarian black & pinto beans, Baja rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, jalapenos, tortilla chips and Salsa Crema wrapped in a warm flour tortilla with your favorite protein.\"

Let's go through the list: 

Fire grilled all white meat chicken: NOPE

Jack and Cheddar cheese: MINIMAL

Black and pinto beans: Almost all black beans, little pinto beans

Smoky Queso Fundito: NOPE

Jalepenos: YES when I didn't WANT ANY

Tortilla chips: Yes

Salsa Crema: NOPE

-----------------

Makes me curious if the people who work here are either stupid, incompetent, or just don't know what they're making. Either way, when I pay $7 for a burrito with CHICKEN IN IT I'd like to get some CHICKEN.

I don't know if they get their chicken from Cuba and there's an embargo or what, but this place ALWAYS skimps on chicken. It's baffling."}
