{"text":"Great food, great service, and good prices. Food is always good, Especially the Chicken Shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Oh...my...GOD. My tummy is so happy right now I don't even know where to begin. So today was my first visit to Pita Wraps, and I got the Supreme Combo with chicken shawarma, steak shawarma and chicken gyro (you get to choose 3 meats) as well as the Italian beef sandwich for my husband and I to split. All of the meats were absolutely delicious and full of flavor. The rice was good, the hummus was excellent, the pita bread was soft and the salad was amazing. I thought it might be a little risky to get an Italian beef sandwich from a Greek restaurant but decided to live on the wild side...and man am I glad I did. It was out of this world. It outshines the sandwiches from places that specialize in Italian beef/Chicago style food. The portions were huge, too. We still have half of the Supreme Combo left, and that's with two people splitting it. The baklava...sooo good.   My only sour experience at this place was a few of the other customers. Some...gentleman (I'm trying to be nice here) came up to the counter and asked for the owner. Then he proceeded to say that he had been waiting 10 minutes to place his order and the cashier was rude by telling him (when he bugged her THREE times) that she would be with him in a minute. She wasn't rude at all, by the way--just super busy. She had just gotten done taking a phone order with TEN meals that were supposed to be rung up separately. Then he said they lost a few customers and walked out. Good! Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya. If he wanted fast food, he should've gone to McDonald's. \"Losing\" that customer wasn't a loss. He's the type who demands his food fast and then complains that the order isn't correct/doesn't taste right. Was there a wait? Yes, definitely. Was it worth it? Absolutely. The place was PACKED (a great sign of excellent food) and it's a new business. They're growing and learning, give them a break. If you're short on time, call ahead. Otherwise, order in person and sit back and enjoy life while you wait. All of the staff was very friendly and busting their tails to get orders out quickly without sacrificing quality or screwing up the order.   I will be back over and over and over again, and you should too. Support this local business!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to grab lunch! I got a gyro and Greek fries and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight since our regular Mediterranean restaurant was closed. I had the gyros wrap and fries which was just ok. My wife had the falafel plate and it wasn't very good. Our food was ready so quick that you know it wasn't made to order. Everything tasted bland, the pitas were dry. We were very disappointed in the food quality. I highly recommend you try Paradise Mediterranean just down the street. The food there is far superior in taste and quality, yes it takes a little longer to get your order but it is well worth the wait. And the owners are so nice!"}
{"text":"So very yummy. Great gyros and Greek fries. Drinks are a little expensive, but the variety and flavor of the teas was great. About average cost for a gyro and between 4 of us 1 order of fries was good but 2 would have been great.  Love love love the Greek fries. 4 of us had my birthday dinner there tonight and 4 gyros, 3 sodas one tea and an order of fries was under $40. Great option for quick pickup dinner that costs about the same and drive through burgers with much better ingredients and flavor. Thank you guys for a great dinner"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Pita Wraps, I eat there 1-2 times a week. Their food is always hot and fresh off the grill... Quick and easy with good service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very good gyros, the variety of other Mediterranean foods is outstanding. A place not to be passed up. Oh yeah, don't forget the desserts."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. What can you say about a restaurant that has pictures of food on the wall that it doesn't serve? The portion of the salad was small, there was a very small amount of dressing with it and it was served on a paper plate! I expect a lot more for what I paid. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had the Beef gyro combo fries and drink $8 ... the meat was on the salty side and probably the meat spit was a lower wholesale cost, definitely not Kronos Meat Co.  Not enough Tadziki sauce and the meat was sliced too thin like a salami sandwich. No fountain drinks just 4 different iced teas and bottled soda... Fries were funky not fresh cut.... nice people but more than likely will not be back..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  The Greek french fries are killer as are the Veggie Pitas.  My favorite is the Hummus Veggie, my hubs likes the Greek Salad Pita.  The food is always fresh and made quickly, and the employees are a delight.  I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"From Chicago and love Gyros Stopped in asked if I could get a menu.  NO ALL OUT.  asked if the seller the Ground meat by the pound and the response is I don't know.  Had to read menu behind counter with small pictures and print.  I've machine out of ice so asked girl behind the counter and she said she was to busy and would get to it..  only a few customers in the place and it still took a long time to get our order.  Cook put it out and girl at the counter walked by it twice so we stepped up and asked if it was our order and told yes.  Girl working the counter did look like she wanted to be there. No customer service skills at all.  Sandwich was good. Taziki sauce needs work. Should use raw onions not grilled.  New to find someone else new at counter. Will only come back know if they get more help, replace counter girl and improve on Taziki sauce and use it liberally on the sandwiches. We were regulars at this location when it was a New York Delight, but like I said above may not come back unless they make changes."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened right by where I work!  I've been maybe five times now, including a few group orders with my co-workers on a busy day.  The restaurant is small for sit-down eating, but clean and well lit.  The staff is always very kind and helpful.  The first time I went was right after they opened and the owners sat and talked to me about how they are using family recipes for most of the food they make, which is very cool.  I love to see small, family businesses do well.  The Feta Gyro Pita is probably my favorite, but you can't go wrong with the schwarma plates, either.  The Greek Fries are always good, and I LOVE the hummus....and the rice...and the falafel.  Oh man, now I am hungry again.  Anyway, support a local business that has really yummy food.  Mediterranean food is good for the body and the soul.  Stop by and become a believer!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros!!!! Baklava was good, not best I've ever had, but still good.  Clean, friendly staff."}
{"text":"The hummus and pita is the best in town   I've only had a couple of plates but have like everything I've had   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food,  clean clean clean restaurant! Nice sized portions, friendly service.  I had the combo plate,  my mother had chicken schwarmer plate.  So wonderful!This will be one of our regular spots! Just sorry I took so long to try it! Delish!"}
{"text":"Small Mom and Pop place.  New building very clean and staff was attentive. Ordered a Gyro and combo sampler. Both were good and it was too much to eat. The Gyro by itself was enough for lunch, very reasonably  priced for Surprise. will come back again, as it's close to work."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab a quick bite! Got the Gyro and Fries.  Very generous portion to say the least.  Very salty, but great flavors! The restaurant was packed - everyone was smiling and having a wonderful time.  Grabbed a ToGo Menu - I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Tried the feta Gyro, great taste with lots of Gyro meat, only twist was never had one with green peppers ,kind of detracts from the rest of the mix. Great prices"}
{"text":"Only have had the gyros.  This is a tuff review.  I love, love, love the pita bread.  It's fresh and soft.  The flavor is very good. The feta gyro is 5.99 and with fries and tea you add $2.  Based on just that it deserves five stars but the negative for me is that it didn't have as much meat as others n I've had but over all much better.  So I would take this over more meat because if the taste."}
{"text":"Great for lunching.  Reasonable pricing and flavorful food.   Simple store front that is friendly, simple, quick and clean."}
{"text":"Overall good food, large menu selection, homemade hummus.  I like the salad, but i find it to be a bit small for the price.  The amount of meat is good, just could use more vegetables.  Service is OK, although they still seem a little overwhelmed.  Don't bother calling in an order as they don't have the resources available to take a phone order.  They are, however, working on online ordering.  Side note, if you miss New York Flavor, the interior is almost identical."}
{"text":"We stopped here yesterday to have lunch. We both had Gyros which were not up to standard in my opinion.  The, what appeared to be the owner, took the order but was not very friendly. We ate in the restaurant and sat maybe 6 feet away from the counter. When the food came the owner alerted us that the food order was ready for us to get up and get it instead of walking a few feet to our table in his still unfriendly demeanor.   The food although lacking in my opinion adequate ingredients tasted just ok not great. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Took my favorite lunch buddies and tried out this new place where New York Flavor used to be. They still have NYF's old chandeliers and the old NY photographs are in the bathrooms which I thought was a bit odd.  I tried the chicken schwarma pita. It was stuffed with very juicy chicken and had pickles mixed in to the sauce. Never had a pita quite like that and it was good. The pita itself was fresh and warm.   One dining buddy had a steak pita which he said the steak was really chewy. He ordered the Greek fries which were very bland. The fries are obviously frozen and they weren't seasoned after having been fried. The feta looked like it was shaken out of a shaker, not big pieces and there was no olive oil drizzle. Just frozen fries with feta shaken out on top. Meh.   My other buddy has simple tastes so he had a hot dog. It was a tasty Vienna beef with a sesame seed bun. He's easy to please.   We did try the cilantro jalapeño hummus for an appetizer. It was by far the blandest hummus I've ever had. There was no spice to it whatsoever.  The pitas were delicious but the hummus was definitely not up to par.  The counter person was cordial enough but I wasn't aware that you could order items as a combo nor it wasn't offered to us when we ordered. As it was our first time, he also should have told us our order number so we'd know which order was ours at the pick up window. All in all it was a 3 star visit at best."}
{"text":"I was so excited for another Mediterranean restaurant in Surprise. I was hoping they had Falafel and they did! I had the Falafel Pita with french fries and for dessert I had baklava. The Falafel Pita was delicious. It was fresh the Falafel was fresh and hot. The only suggestion I would have is to put more sauce on the pita, there was a little bit of drizzled sauce on the bottom of the pita and I wanted more of that flavor. The Baklava seemed a little drier.   I like a little more honey in there, but this may be more traditional than American baklava. I will definitely be back and I hope to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fancy chandeliers hang above a row of tables across from the counter, radio plays smash mouth.  It's an eclectic spot for sure.  The food is delicious!  Salads are enormous and the dolmas were on point!  Great spot and worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place just opened 3 days ago. My daughter and I have been eagerly anticipating a new Greek place in Surprise. We aren't fans of the only other local Greek place.  Anyway, the first thing I noticed was that the hours were posted on the door. 11:00-7:00. I was very surprised that they close so early but then maybe just thought it was because they're so new they are playing it conservative until they gauge demand.  I was promptly greeted and my order taken without incident. The menu board is large and easy to read. It's a small joint, but was appropriately furnished. They have kitschy chandeliers in the dining room!  I ordered chicken schwarma pita. The pita was stuffed, I mean stuffed with juicy perfectly roasted chicken. They pita was fresh and of regulation pita size. There was a sauce in the pita that my kid didn't care for but I didn't mind. Of note, there were pickles in the pita. What's interesting is I don't normally like pickles but they worked in this particular dish! The portion was large enough that I could only eat half! Lunch tomorrow-score!! We also tried the classic hummus and pita. The portion of hummus was pretty small. If you're ordering for 2+ people, order 2 and you'll have to pay for extra pita bread. It only comes with 1 piece!  I also got the grilled veggie bowl. DAYUM! Grilled zucchini, onions, peppers over perfectly seasoned rice. Again, a large enough portion that I only ate half.  All in all a decent enough Greek food place in Surprise. The portions were adequate and the prices were fair.  Welcome to Surprise, Pita Wraps!"}
{"text":"Very good food , of course I had a salad pita with fries but it was delicious especially the dressing and cheese they put on it . Friendly service,  I actually had to go sit in my car because all the food smells were getting at me ( I'm pregnant ) and I asked if they would bring it to me in my car and they totally did without hesitation no questions asked  which was awesome."}
{"text":"Very nice staff...good prices. Food was just ok. Had better in SoCal but not bad. I didnt care for the rice which seemed almost waxy and firm in nature like that fake Uncle Bens rice-in-a-poach mess. The gyros was tender but a little bland. Afterwards my mouth was so dried out and felt blood pressure shoot up that it must of had tons of salt hidden."}
{"text":"Pita Wraps is AMAZING!  Best gyros and baklava around.  Love that this is family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever! Get the baklava! My husband and I go here for lunch dates at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very affordable and really excellent, healthy food!  I go here often and have never been disappointed with anything.  I particularly love the falafel (some of the best I've had), gyros, and red pepper hummus."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this. Cute place with owners polite young son working the register. I had the chicken shawarma plate. Chicken was flavorful, pita was great, salad was also good. Hummus was a bit bland but oh well. Plenty of food, took home a doggy box full. Would def go again, maybe try a salad."}
{"text":"We had the Greek fries and  gyros and they were wonderful!  Will definitely go back and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Falling in love after the first bite Pita wraps rocks their food is amazing it's a shame that I live far from there but I love their food so I have to tell my wife that we are  making more  trips across town because I'm going back again and again and again and again and again ."}
{"text":"Saw a new place that opened for Greek food. This place is fantastic! The beef gyros are very good and the dolmas (served cold) is delicious! I WILL be back to try the chicken schwarma as well.  Great service,  friendly staff, comfortable environment."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great had the chicken shawarma salad is was very good. Steve had the falafel wrap and said it was fantastic. He said this place is now his 2nd favorite place to eat in Surprise. The place was clean and staff very friendly. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff and they let you pick your own Baklava! My brother and I love going here, it's a bit of a drive but totally worth it the food is affordable and the highest quality, always clean and they have very good fries !"}
{"text":"Been to 12 Mediterranean places in the valley and this is by far the best!   Try the Shwarma, its magic!!!  Also great greek fries ask for greek dressing and it takes it over the top.  Customer service is beyond great, i asked for sriracha, they said sry we don't have any. You bet your ass they had some the next day!! Thats an owner who cares for his customers... enjoy tell em Joseppi sent ya!  Also they are talking about extending the hours:-)   Enjoy,  Joseppi"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! Food is so good and fresh. Cooked to perfection. The staff is very friendly and I believe family owned. I see the reviews of when they first opened and believe like any starting business they just needed to work the kinks out. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in Town.  I love a good gyro and the gyro here was great and the service was fast.  I'd seen the place a few times but never stopped in because I thought oh, another chain with marginal food, but this time around I gave it a shot because I was really jonesing for a gyro.  After going here I noticed another Mediterranean place ranked well in Surprise but it didn't compare.  This is the place I'll be going any time I need a Gyro fix!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times already.They're customer service is really great. The blonde girl who works in the front is very sweet. They obviously have potential so I keep coming back for more they disappoint me every time. The food is okay but sometimes terrible. Their falafel is extremely dry, I've ordered it three times. Their wraps are never the same and always lacking. I just ordered a hummus veggie pita and their are no cucumbers and pretty much no toppings just the hummus. I ordered 2 and both were different proportions. The falafel pita from Mike's Kitchen is way better and is actually full of food."}
{"text":"Lunch was great!  I had the Gyro Salad and loved it. Hubby had the Beef Gyro and was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food was acceptable, but not OMG good!   The food is a little pricey for what you get.  Staff was very friendly and the place was clean.  The problem for me is that this place closes at 7PM.  I don't even get home from work until 6:30PM.  Heck, most of the time I am not even hungry until 7PM.  Not sure how this place will make it being closed during prime dinner hours.  Several times already we have passed on this place because of the 7PM close time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best shawarma chicken pitas ive had ! The sauce is delicious! The hummus and the tzatziki sauce were very good as well. Nice folks running a good business"}
{"text":"I just had the greatest pita and Greek salad of my life! Some of you may think I'm exaggerating, but no joke the best! I've been looking everywhere for one that was as great as one I had in the past when visiting San Diego, but never could until today. I have been driving by this place for weeks trying to find an opportunity to go since my family are not as big of fans of Greek food as I am ( I'm sad for them too) and today while I was out on my own I made the right decision in stopping. When I walked in there was no one else inside and I'm guessing because it's 4pm. As I am looking over the menu more and more people began to walk in. The menu was extensive and I finally decided on a chicken pita and large Greek salad to go. It was kinda pricy to me at $15, but I've really been wanting to try it and the portions looked huge. I was right. The man taking my order wasn't very friendly and really didn't even speak besides to repeat my order, but wasn't rude or impatient when I was trying to decide. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready and they bagged it up and I drove home. Let me tell you something.....When I opened the box I was expecting to see a bit of a mess because it was to go and I had to leave it in the seat next to me to drive home.  It looked beautiful when I got home. The salad looked perfect and wonderfully set. The dressing was so so good. My pita was wrapped perfectly and also presented very well. I may see myself in a lot of trouble here because now I'll have to try every other thing on the menu. The only thing I'm regretting is that I didn't try the hummus, but alas there is always next time. By next time I mean tomorrow.....just kidding. Or am I?"}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome local family run place! The flavors are on point. Prices are excellent, especially the shawarma plate that comes with a salad and some hummus (which is killer).   I've been many times now. Doesn't seem very crowded. Hopefully others try this spot and realize how excellent it is. Family run joint, everyone super friendly. Definitely be back!  Down sides? They close at 7pm."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here after moving to Surprise.  Excellent the first time, and my second visit was just as good.  Had the combination plate with Gyro and Chicken Shawarma.  The plate comes with pita, a small side salad, hummus and rice.  A great value and everything was delicious, I'm not a huge rice fan but i wiped out the rice both times. The meat was delicious and the pita was warm and fresh.  A clean pleasant environment I'm guessing run by a family it appears. Stop in and give them a try, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love Pita Wraps. We were in three times in ten days when we first discovered it. We love the Greek Salad Pita Wrap and the Grilled Veg Pita Wrap. Hubby had the chicken schawarma plate last time and got more than he expected with salad and hummus.  Everything is so fresh and yummy, it's a good thing that it's 15 minutes from the house or I'd have to start paying rent. Yum!"}
{"text":"I really like their gyro plate.  With a large amount of gyro meat, hummus, rice, fresh pita and a side salad I always feel like it was a healthy delicious dinner. Family owned and very nice folks."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this strip restaurant, definitely worth the stop!  We had Gyro Greek Salads.  The Pita Bread was outstanding!  We also had Baklava and that as well was perfect, not too sweet!  Will definately return to try more!!  The service was top notch, very personable!"}
{"text":"My family stopped in last night for dinner and my husband got the gyro and fries, my son had the hot dog and fries and I had the chicken schwarma plate.  Even though it was near closing time, the young man at the counter was very polite and patient with us and the food was delicious.  We will definitely be back.  Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"First time stopping into this place today. I was getting a little nervous when the guy at the cash register cannot understand the details on my order. But I have to say my order did come out right and delicious I would definitely recommend this place and I'll deathly be visiting number of times again"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch with my parents. I got the hummus veggie pita (I am a vegetarian) and the classic hummus with pita bread. The man at the register was very patient with me even though I took a little while to figure out what I wanted. The food didn't take long to be ready at all. Some of the best Greek food I've ever had! Very nice owners and very good food."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick bite to eat.  Certainly happy to see a new Mediterranean restaurant in Surprise. Located off W Bell Road, located opposite Adelante Healthcare, between the barbershop and Papa Johns Pizza.  Lots of available parking outside with no dining options outside.  Inside was clean, plenty of space, and great lighting. Staff were helpful and courteous.  Menu was easy to read, located above the cashiers. Food was delicious -- order the steak shawarma plate with came with hummus, rice, pita bread, and a side of Greek salad along with the layers of marinated steak broiled on a vertical skewer and served with house made tahini sauce!  Truly delicious.  Prices are reasonable, and in my opinion, you get more food compared to some other Greek restaurants I've been to in the surrounding areas. Will recommend and will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Steak Shawarma Pita. It was juicy and a lot of flavor and meat. My husband loves Gyros and always wants them. He enjoyed his Gyro but said the tzatziki sauce was a little bland.  There have been a couple Greek Places to open in Surprise that have not been successful, so we are thankful this one opened and will support it as much as we can!"}
{"text":"Greek food is always high on my list. I wanted to like this place but unfortunately the food wasn't good. The service was slow and their credit card machine was down so after waiting forever, I had to go run to an ATM machine down the street. My husband had the gyro and I had the chicken platter. Both were pretty bland and just tasted plain. Greek food is generally flavorful and the portions are on the larger side. This was the opposite. We will stick to Pita Kitchen in Avondale."}
{"text":"Very good, fresh. Run by real Greeks the way it should be. But if your on a lunch break good luck. Took 32 minutes to get a gyro and fries. I know they are new but that's just way to long. And they only serve iced tea with the meals."}
{"text":"The food quality is always excellent! I usually get it to take back to my office but the times I've eaten there the service has been great. It's clean and everything tasted very fresh. First place I've ever had chicken gyros, fyi, which are awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat In surprise! The schwarma is so juicy and well seasoned and the pita is nice and fluffy. So many Mediterranean places in Chicago and not much in Surprise. This ranks with some of the best."}
{"text":"Great little place with huge flavor. The gyro plate and Schwarma plate were delicious and plentiful. If you buy a plate it also comes with a beautiful and fresh side salad. Their homemade hummus is right up my alley with warm pita bread on the side. You can tell that they are family owned.. they are all so sweet!! One of the ladies brought out little packages of Halloween pretzels for my two children. I thought that was such a sweet gesture.  I wish that I would have had enough room to try he baklava. That looked amazing!! I also wish I would have taken the time to take a picture of the food but it was so good we gobbled it up!!! It's a nice clean establishment! Give it a try! Thank you for coming to Surprise and making my tummy so very happy!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and always delicious!  Fresh veggies, fresh meat... there aren't many places to get a good gyro, but this place is one of them. The customer service is top of the line as well."}
{"text":"Love mid-eastern food so we stopped in for a few appetizers.  Falafel and two kinds of humus (red-pepper and cilantro jalapeño).  Pita bread came with the food.  The falafel was not good.  The inside was dense and tasted like it was \"raw\".  The only seasoning that we tasted was pepper and way too much salt.  The tahini dip was also over the top salty.  Now for the humus... the red pepper was better than the cilantro jalapeño but neither had any flavor.  If I was blindfolded I could not tell you what I was eating and doubt that I could tell you which was which.  The portions were small for the price.  The pita was okay but we didn't go for the bread.   Doubtful that we will go back."}
{"text":"Always excellent, I'm a regular, always friendly and they get the order right and better than any other I've been to for custom order correctness."}
{"text":"Family owned, friendly staff and a great place for lunch or an early dinner!  I work in Glendale so I was thrilled to see a Mediterranean Grill pop up in Surprise where I live. To date, we have had no Mediterranean quick service established here.   I had the Gyro Pita with a side salad and hubby had the Steak Shawarma Pita with Greek fries. My Gyro was phenomenal. Fresh, hot, and the right combination amounts of ingredients.   Hubby said his was good too, but he doesn't eat this type of food very much and got it on my suggestion.   The owners' son was my cashier and was very friendly and courteous.   My only complaint is the small quantity of Greek Fries with the $3.50 price tag (equivalent to an overflowing small fries at Wendy's). Granted the fries had Feta cheese, but the fries weren't made in-house which would definitely warrant the price.  I would suggest upping the quantity to match the price or reduce the price to $2.50 to be competitive... or even better, make the fries in house!   Otherwise a phenomenal experience. We will be back for the pita sandwiches and will try the rice as a side next time."}
{"text":"Incredible Greek food!! Awesome customer service. Family run operation with the Dad cooking up the amazing gyros, Mom making the delicious lentil soup and son ringing up our order. We will definitely be back soon."}
