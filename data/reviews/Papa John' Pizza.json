{"text":"they open pretty late for late customers like me  I picked up browny (let's go browns thanks for exciting games these days)  wings with chipotle and honey mustard  and chicken grilled pizza  well made friendly greeting with pick up order  I am so glad papa john pizza is around finally near here so I can avoid pizza hut"}
{"text":"Fast, good, friendly. FYI they wash their hands here, so just because the dough guy answers tge phone doesn't make it unsanitary. Will order from here for my next papa johns fix."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizzas several time from this location.  Unfortunately, the last two pizzas were really not very good.  The toppings were so sparse that if I didn't know what toppings I ordered I would not be able to tell from looking at the pizza.  Their quality seems to have deteriorated over the years.  Don't know if corporate ever orders from some of the franchises but I would certainly recommend looking into this location.  I would definitely not recommend this Papa John's."}
{"text":"Tonight I went into papa johns to pick up my pizzas. I noticed that the man who was kneading the pizza dough was also answering the phone! Makes me wonder if the employees working at the register were also making pizza. Unsanitary will never go back."}
