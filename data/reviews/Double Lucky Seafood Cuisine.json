{"text":"An average Cantonese restaurant, serving seafood and BBQ. We came for dinner, ordered the Roasted Duck Combo. The duck was good, thinly sliced, but the wrappers were too soft, very easily tore apart. Veggie in fish stock was surprisingly delicious, crisp and fresh. The dinner combo came with a steamed fish, which was the best of all. The fish was fresh and well prepared, soy sauce added a salty flavor. Pork Chops were deep-fried with some kind BBQ sauce, way too sweat. Tofu pudding was good. No comment on the Gouji jelly."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday with my mom and let me just say that this place is not worth it at all. It's $2.50, Monday to Fridays for S, M and L sizes. Now you might be thinking' \"that's pretty cheap!\" YOU THOUGHT. All the S, M and L dishes don't include the \"good stuff\", meaning rice rolls; shrimp or beef are XL which means more money. If you're a cheapo like me, you wouldn't want to spend $3.68 for XL or $4.48 for SP. The food I ordered were either extremely salty or tasteless, there is no in-between. I'll give it two stars because the service wasn't that bad. I don't plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"The MSG, they put so much in everything I did not stop drinking water the whole time and after.

Six people (4 adults and 2 kids) came for dinner tonight, we ordered a 5 pound lobster and Peking duck set dinner for 6-8 persons for $148 (with fine print of cash only). It was a disappointment from the moment we sat down. We were seated in a tiny table good for 4-5 people. We asked to be reseated to a larger table knowing that we would be ordering the set dinner and supposedly a lot of food, the server refused and said \"dishes don't all come at once\".  I find that a pretty rude response. The Peking duck was alright, basic and nothing out of the ordinary. The seafood shark fin soup did not have a trace of shark fin. I know shark fin had been outlawed, but would be nice to have a few fake substitutes, or else they should rename the soup to something else and don't call it \"?\". The quantity served was also not as advertised on the menu as we got only six small bowls about 80% full. I wonder who would be without soup if there were actually eight people at the table. Perhaps they withheld our soup knowing that there were only six of us, but that is bad business practice. The lobster was also on the side of small, more like a four pounder than a five. We were never shown the lobster before it was cooked. We ordered the lobster in ginger and onion style, and likewise the ginger and onion were scant. When the table was quickly running out of room for more dishes, we noticed two things happening: first they stopped serving any more dishes altogether, and when that only worked for a time, they tried to make room by consolidating and/or moving the food to a smaller dish. In doing so the server moved the lettuce leaves over to the duck meat, without first asking us if that would be okay. The server appeared annoyed when I told her that I did not want her transferring (the lettuce was wet and would add water to the duck meat). She just shook her head and infuriatingly moved the lettuce over to a smaller dish. When I pointed out to her the leftover water on the dish, she did nothing about it and marched away. The Yee Foo noodle with abalone sauce was tasteless, but the super amount of msg was so evident that my mouth immediately craved for water. The fish was about half the size of what other restaurants serve in the area. For a dinner that was advertised for up to 8 people, and we had only four adults and two kids, there should have been plenty of food left over, but that was not the case. In fact I was still feeling hungry at the end of the meal. The same server who refused to re-seat us brought us the check before we ever asked for it. Overall, not a pleasant experience, both food quality and service wise. My grading based on quality of food and price, I give it a one star. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal for 4 for dinner. The dishes weren't special and has a lot veggies and little meat. The dessert was soyamilk pudding that seems to be old."}
{"text":"Save your money. Out of the many dim sums we tried, they didn't get 1 right. Looks cheap in terms of pricing, but for the quality, you are actually paying too much."}
{"text":"HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!

I ate here last night with my family for CNY. It was packed, and it was very hard to move from table to table as they have their tables so close to one another. While the beginning of the dinner was fine, service was speedy and the food was mediocre, it was when we were waiting for our last 2 courses that I wished we had never come here. We were awaiting the 5 lbs lobster for over 45 minutes!!! We asked them a two times about it and they would just say 'yes, it's coming, i'll check on it'. Finally, the manager was very rude and yelled at us that it was coming in 1 minute but it never did, it came 15 minutes later. They never came to clear our food and just left us there. I didn't understand as I saw lots of food coming from the kitchen for other tables but not ours. 

At the end of our dinner, they gave us 2 free chinese newspaper to apologize for the delay of the lobster. It was already 9pm by then, what are we going to do with old newspaper?! When we finished putting down our money, the server had the audacity to count the money in front of us to make sure we paid enough. How rude is that?!?!?!?! I've never witnessed such horrible service from a restaurant. Needless to say, we will NEVER be going back, 

Here's a summary for my experience : HORRIBLE SERVICE, SLOW SERVICE, MEDIOCRE FOOD, RUDE SERVERS."}
{"text":"This Chinese cuisine is at Markham and very close to Markville mall. Firstly, the food did not really impressed me that much. Second, had a bad experience with this place. The problem about this place is the service, one of the waiter was very unpolite. When I try to add one dim sum (which we have food on our table already) which marked on the paper, the waiter say 'what? Only adding one dim sum?) And with a angry face showing us how we only adding one dim sum and not multiple which kind of waste her time coming to our table. After, she say 'so you don't need the menu paper anymore right?' And she ripped the menu paper infont us without letting us to answer as we actually want to keep looking on the menu paper. Because of this kind of service manner, my family and I had a bad experience which I will only give a 1 out of 5. We decided not to come here anymore because of this ridiculous service which we encounter the first time."}
{"text":"My first time having dinner at this place and it was very good. Many different seafood to choose from with reasonable price. Their cooks care about the small details and the dishes were delicious. 

I haven't had good Chinese food for a long time as most restaurants are so so and loaded with MSG. I told them not to use MSG and it was minimal; I understand that some sauces that they bought already come with MSG. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"An interesting hidden gem. Not for their regular menu items for for one particular one. The chicken stuffed with glutinous rice. 

Take one chicken and replace all the bones with rolls of flavoured glutinous rice. Steam until cooked. Then deep fry until crispy. 

I've never seen this dish done elsewhere. Definitely come check it out. You will need to call to order this ahead of time as this is not something they can do on the spot."}
{"text":"Located at the small strip plaza across from Markville Mall, it is very convenient to get to. Parking is adequate. Staff was pleasant. Weekday dimsum is priced at $2.50 for S, M, L from opening til 11:00am. Tea is $0.80 per person. While prices are  competitive, the choices are a bit limited as some dishes like congee or rice noodle rolls are classified as XL.  Food comes out steaming hot, a good sign. Taste is ok, as is portion size. I just wish the menu would have more items in the S, M, L range."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place! My family has been going here for at least a year and today we went to have a nice birthday breakfast for my daughter because she loves dim sum. We arrive and are pointed to a vague direction to sit. We chose a table and apparently the choice of table was unsatisfactory with one of the black coats. She then slams the tea pot and throws the menu checklist on the table. We place our order and after eating I ask for the bill. It came up to $38. I gave $40 and said keep the change. Of course the black coat has her sour puss face on, brings me back the bill and points to the total, I then point to the $40 and repeat keep the change. She walks away saying something in Chinese and then the manger comes over and says 10% tip while pointing to the bill!?! WTF AHHH NO....

1st of all you great us like animals by vaguely pointing to a table
2nd you throw down the menu 
3rd you slam down the tea pot 
AND NOW YOU EXPECT A TIP! YA I DON'T THINK SO!!!!
Do you know the meaning of what a TIP even means!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday with my family. It's $2.68 ea dish, Monday to Fridays for S, M and L sizes.  We came cos of the newspaper ads (free tea and a free newspaper). However, when we arrived at 1pm, they said all newspapers gone before 11am! Most common stuffs are XL ($3.68) or $4.48 (SP). Some dishes are pity salty. Service wasn't that bad. They charged us tea price per person at the end....not as the ads! I doubt I will come back again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food, it was well cooked and everything was enjoyable. Har Gow was phenomenal. Shame though that the pop costs $2 (for a can) and then they tried to double charge us at the end. But I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"It's located at a run down plaza with even more dated decor.  When you enter you are kind of hit with a odd old smell which I find slightly unpleasant but get used to over time.  I'd have to say that their quality has gotten better over time and now most of the dim sum are pretty good for value.

They have a cheung fun (rice noodle wrap) of pig kidney which is surprisingly very tasty and easily one of our favourite items on the menu.  I think their steamed dim sum is much better than their fried/dry dim sum.  They also have a variety of fried rice/noodle.  I've only tried a few and while the taste is nothing special, it's usually a huge plate so it's great value."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant for a while, may be like a month of time, I was surprised when I sat down looked at the menu. The size of several dim sum dishes has changed, they are upgraded to one size up. In other words, the price is different, higher than before. It shouldn't be a big problem if the quality of the food is good. However, I found that not only the price has gone up, the quality of the food has degraded. For example, siu mai is no longer using just pork meat, it is mixed with some other kind of ingredients which made it looks bigger but also looks whiter. When I took a bite, there are chunks of fat inside the meat. This is only one of the examples. Another one I would want to point out is the rice noodles with shrimps, \"ha cheun fan\". It is no longer a Large dish but an extra large dish but the rice noodles have become more thicker. I am quite disappointed  of the food that I have tasted today. I don't want to come back again."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner, lots of variety of the Chinese food. Price is high for the high quality of food."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is good for a very reasonable price and the service is good also. It can be a wait to get a seat but for the most part the wait is not too longer."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum here today, as I was at a doctors appointment, in the same plaza. I was with my youngest daughter. We ordered 5 dishes and they came out fairly quickly. Food is ok here, I especially like the sui mai here. They are fluffy, juicy and tender.  Everything else is of an ok standard. Have been here for dinner a few times, but that was a while ago. 
The place used to be busier but it's not as busy anymore. All S, M and L dim sum is the same price all day. XL is only $3, like the clay pot rice and pan fried beef short ribs. 
There was a chinese sign on the front door. From my very, very, very limited chinese, I think it said that they have an early dim sum special, Mon to Fri. Think the price was only $1.99 for S, M and L. Don't quote me on that, go and check it out. Wish more places put their signs up in English too. It would make my life easier and make it less intimidating for non Chinese readers, like me, to go eat there."}
{"text":"If I reviewed this earlier, it would have been a 4* but the quality of their dimsum has dropped.

I don't incorporate service in my reviews for Chinese restaurants because it's just not something to consider. It's like expecting a sushi chef to wait at the corner of your table. It just is not the custom.

So before, the prices were super cheap ($2.38 for a small) but now they've upped it by 20¢, which seems trivial at first glance but 2.58 is considered mid range. Also most of their dishes are XL now, so they're $5+ per dish.

They took out some staple dimsum, like the preserved meat and sausage stone pot rice. This is as staple as siumai! I loved it. :(

Flavours were a bit salty but what really brought it down was the small things. 

In their bbq pork puff pastries, they used to put real bbq pork in there. Now, it's 80% sauce and 20% tiny bits of bbq pork if it even still is bbq pork at this point.

Their Siu mai has too strong of pork flavour. Traditionally, the fat in pork can balance this out but the pork they used is either seasoned differently or its just too lean. There were even tendons in the meat. This is just sloppy work.

Ha Gow wrap is way too thick. You couldn't even chopstick it out of the bamboo dish thing without it sticking to all the other ones too! So we get the shrimp rice roll now because we still want shrimp but ha Gow is def off the list.

So why is it a 3? Probably because price is still lower than most places, it's close, and some dishes are passable.

Also their tea is a hit and miss. Sometimes it's super amazing and flavourful, and other times you can't get the tea flavour out even an hour into the meal.

Scarborough definitely has better choices."}

{"text":"A sub-par dimsum joint.  Both the service, price, and quality of food used to be far better when they were still called Hoi-Tin, but evidently, time have really changed.

The prices now are higher than before, and not competitive anymore - they're pretty much the same as other dim-sum restaurants in the area now, nothing special.  They're service has really fell and the waitresses now seem very unprofessional and unwilling to do refill tea, get an extra set of utensils, etc.

Their food tends to be on the salty side and their meats are often filled with fat! The quality of their rice noodles really fluctuates - on some days, they can be fresh and warm, on others, the skin is thick, there is almost no filling, and it's barely warm.  In general, not sure why, their food is really only warm, and never hot.

The dinner really wasn't an improvement at all.  We ordered a pot with vegetables and mutton, and it looked half eaten when it came to our table! The amount of food in the pot didn't even reach the top and there was also very little steam coming out - odd, considering those stone pots are usually filled to the brim and sizzling when served. Keep in mind there were also maybe 2 other tables in the restaurant with us, so it's fair to say that the kitchen wasn't overwhelmed with cooking either.

We've gone here twice for tea and once for dinner, and it for all those times, the quality of food, atmosphere, and service really feel short of the price we paid."}
{"text":"This place has been opened for awhile now and I''ve already given it 2 chances so It's about time that I yelp about it...it's not a place I would think of...the only reason(s) I would go is due to my friend asking or else I won't go back at all...horrific...

The food is meh...soo much MSG that I couldn't stop drinking water right after the food...it could be the MSG and/or the sodium but this is ridiculously bad. I won't be surprised if one random day I passed by and it suddenly becomes another restaurant...like most of the other ones that has opened in the past at the same location....doesn't that tell you something??

I was still very thirsty after drinking so much water and tea...THIS IS NOT the place you should ever bring anyone...Yuckkkk...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (but rated down due to the lack of service)

Double Lucky is conveniently located in a plaza off Highway 7.  It is a great spot for Chinese food because they have a large selection and set menus available.  

My party ordered the $400 menu that included soup, appetizer, lobster, fish, chicken, noodles and fried rice.     Food is fresh and above average, but their chicken is on par.   

Again, we barely had any service.  I still can't believe that they just left a pot of soup on the table and we had to serve ourselves!  Spoke with the waitress toward the end of the meal and they are on the Skelton crew between Monday to Thursday."}
{"text":"$2.80 for all size dim sum unless marked otherwise so it's pretty cheap. The spring rolls and pork liver rice roll (cheung fun) were not bad. Service was slow as the food came one at a time with a few mix-ups between tables. Quite noisy and overall a more casual dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Low quality dim sum for cheap price. They put veggies in siu mai to cut cost & give you less meat. Better to go to better place if you want quality. Go to Shangri-La in Markham on Esna Rd. They have good dim sum, way better quality and good price. We would never go eat at Double Lucky again"}
{"text":"Double Lucky is one of the places I frequent for dim sum. They offer a good selection at very reasonable prices. Orders are placed by checking off items on a menu. It seems like fewer places are pushing the carts around so you can see the actual dishes you're being served.

The food flavour is usually very good, although today's noodle soup was a bit bland. The food arrives hot, very hot! I guess that's the upside of not pushing it around on a cart. ;)

Service wasn't terrible but could have been a little better. I suspect this could be different if we all spoke the same language. Parking is the biggest problem with this plaza. It's always busy and not the easiest to navigate. Despite the few shortcomings, I'll continue to come here. Maybe I'll even come for dinner one day..."}
{"text":"Food is average and service is not great. Not a bad deal on the weekend for dimsum. Small, medium and large are all $3.08, then XL is $3.88 and Special is $4.88."}
{"text":"Got one of those set meals which you would usually get for typical Chinese Weddings because our group was quite large. Everything was decent, no complaints. Some of the things that came with the meal were sliced jelly fish as appetizer, soup, lobster, fried fish, chicken, quail, fried noodles, sweet lotus root as dessert. The only thing that stood out for me was the lobster. The sauce had a sweet honey taste and it helps that the lobster was3-4 lbs so the chunks of lobster were plentiful."}
{"text":"The owner is very hard sell.  Not  very  clean.  Music very  annoying.  Every time we had  oysters,  our whole family fought for the bathroom for  12 hours. We suspect the seafood tank is not clean.  They have some  reasonable combos. Most dishes have too much  garlic. Bathroom very dirty."}
{"text":"I came here one day for lunch before work. I think the service here is slightly better than other Chinese restaurant but the food tastes just about the same. I ordered the fried dough rice with green onion. The rice wrapping was a bit too sticky and wasn't perfect but nevertheless, it was still satisfying to eat. I also ordered pan fried bun with vegetable and meat which is one of my favourite things to eat. I think they did a decent job here. They had pumpkin and corn congee here which I could not pass up. I thought it was tasty but it could have more pumpkin taste! For dessert, I ordered fried sesame stick with egg yolk and again, it was average.
I think this is a good place to go to for dim sum if you're around this area. The restaurant is clean, there is room for you to move around a bit unlike other restaurant where there's a chair right behind you and the food was decent!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family.  Ordered a set dinner, included lobster and crab etc.., 
The lobster was listed as 5lbs, waitress comes back and says, we are out of 5lb lobster, add a half pound for $9. We said fine...
Later on during the dinner, we see other tables with smaller size lobsters..... makes you wonder about that half pound that cost an extra $9.
If they are out, should they not upsize you for a resonable price??  Is $9 for half a pound... resonable??

Food is ok, portions are good.

Place didnt get busy until after 7pm ( this is a sunday).

3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Really bad.... order two people set dinner $88 with (fake) shark fin soup, deep fried pigeon (with hair), chewy canned abalone, (fake) bird nest dessert. This whole thing is not worth $88.... I suggest to try a la carte instead."}
{"text":"It could have been a zero but there is no such rating to select. Service was super lousy, not the ordinary lousy kind of service. The waiters were extremely rude. They wouldn't care when I asked them to add a seat. When I waved to a female server for chilli sauce, she shook her head with her arms folded and told you to ask someone else, like a boss giving instructions to you. This place is ridiculous in terms of service and our family and some friends decided never to come back again. There are definitely better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Double Lucky not so lucky. 

Came here with my family on a Monday night. We ordered the 6 person dinner which includes (rated out of 5 stars):
Crab and fish maw soup ****
Chicken ***
Veggies and Abalone ***
Steamed Fish **
Double Lobster *
Ginger Milk ****

Took them hour and half and they had only served the first 3 dishes. We watched them bring out dishes (same ones that we were waiting for) to tables that were seated after us. We finished the 3 dishes and had to wait another 20mins for them to finally bring out the rest. I get that maybe they were short staffed, but the server was not apologetic or friendly about it at all.

We made reservations, told them over the phone which menu we wanted. Got there at 7:45 and wasn't able to leave until 10pm.

Foodwise they could have used a bit more flavour in every dish. The soup, veggies, and chicken were good. The lobster was disappointingly small (less than 1lb each) and bland. Fish was from frozen fish and not live fish. Ginger Milk was really good, like milk custard with a a hint of ginger.

Might be good for someone who's looking for less MSG or salt in their Chinese food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good despite the bad reviews on Yelp. Too bad there's no half stars lols I'd give it 3.5. 

Average priced dim sum (compared to some it's actually on the cheaper end).

Going there on a Saturday morning before 11am is usually not too bad. We only waited for 5 minutes.

Since this is not an upscale restaurant and it's only dim sum, it's expected that service is only average. Which is ok with me, because I just want my food.

Top dishes I recommend that most likely can't go wrong:

1. BBQ Pork Bun - (I believe this is off menu. Check my picture for reference. This is REALLY good. It's the thing on the top bun that makes it super delicious.)

2. Fried sesame ball w/ egg yolk - Out of this world! O_O ..Be careful, it's hot! Don't just take one bite. Bite it until the oil and the golden egg yolk starts dripping down. Oh sooo goooood. I've have this dessert in different restaurants, unfortunately nowhere makes it as good as them. The perfect size sesame ball with the perfect amount of egg yolk.

3. Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles - So chewy and fresh. Perfectly deep fried and seasoned.

4. Pumpkin and corn congee - Once in awhile, it's good to eat something healthy. This congee was really good and I'm so glad they serve it here. Most places only have the typical Lean Pork with Thousand Year Old Egg Congee. It was delicious with a hint of sweetness from both the corn and the pumpkin. Yum!

I usually love eating chicken feet, but theirs was too bland. All I need is one look at it and I can tell it's not tasty - it wasn't red enough. Their rice noodle is also bland. I blame the soya sauce they use. It wasn't salty or sweet. It just tasted watered down.

Overall, great place to go for dim sum. Some dishes may not impress but the top 4 dishes that I recommended certainly impressed me :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum. It's more or less what you expect. The waiters were good, but the servers were extremely rude. They just don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Double Lucky Seafood Cuisine was Hai Tian last week..but today is the grand opening day of Double Lucky.

New signs, fresh paint, new chair covers and new cook and owner. The wait staffs though are the same as the previous business.

Dim Sum prices is really reasonable at $2.28 for S/M/L Monday to Friday till 4 pm and on weekends $2.48.

There are some interesting items on the menu, but I decided to stick with some of my to go items to try out the kitchen. 

-Double Lucky Steamed Shrimp Dumplings
(The wrapping is a little too chewy and sticky but plenty of shrimps with good bite)

-Steamed Siu Mai with Fish Roe
(lean and fat mixture gives this a good texture! and tons of mushrooms)

-Steamed Rice Noodle with Beef& Coriander

-Fried Sesame Stick w/Black Sesame Paste
 (I don't know why I got this sesame balls with the Custard egg york filling..where are the black sesame!! And those are balls!! not Sticks!)

All the items I ordered came out hot and fresh and most important really tasty too!

Steamed Fish Head, Steamed Lamb Meat also on the dim sum menu, I will wait for others to try and let me know.....

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I was here with my family on Chinese New Year weekend, as such, I assumed the restaurant would be prepared for the influx of Chinese families wanting to celebrate this special occasion. However, I and many other families present were greatly disappointed. Here is why:

1. The restaurant was severely understaffed, this meant most tables had to wait over 30 minutes for one dish to come out.
2. The assistant manager(?) with the short hair cut was very rude and even would glare at some of the customers. 
3. The staff members were bickering amongst each other in front of the customers too!
4. To top it off, the assistant manager wanted a tip despite the lack of customer service skills.
5. Lastly, some of our meals were incomplete and were missing ingredients that were clearly described in the menu.

Overall, if I could give this a lower rating I would. Would I come back to this restaurant? No thanks."}
