{"text":"Tried to use Groupon...wouldn't allow me to redeem because they dont have a barcode reader. Said I needed original email so I presented the email with Groupns 3 steps...Pull up Groupon with our mobile app (or print it out).
2. Present Groupon upon arrival.
3. Enjoy!
So after showing Them I did all of these steps except enjoy.. smh... their response was that I can't redeem with those steps...smh
Well there's no Enjoyment at North Versailles Bowling Alley only disappointment and loss of money. Kids highly upset...oh not to mention last time we went we had to move two lanes because balls wouldn't return...last straw was when asked to move again to a third lane because of ball not returning. Smh horrible. Had to go spend more money at Great Valley Bowling Alley smh"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've had at a business in a long time. We walked in the door at 6p on Saturday night.  We were the 3rd group in line at the desk.  There was one lady running around getting nothing done as fast as possible,  one man hiding in a back office who occasionally came out,  and one teen who was helping at the register.  Our group consisted of 2 families including 2 kids who needed bumpers and 4 adults.  The employees could not have moved slower!  After waiting 30 minutes in the line,  we were finally ready to get our shoes. It took another 10 minutes to get shoes.  We also asked to be placed on two side by side lanes (any of the 8 that were open).  They told us they can't put us side by side - we have to be on one lane in case someone else comes in to bowl.....I'll repeat that...in a bowling alley that doesn't take reservations and claims to be first come first served, they would not service the customer standing there to pay in case the customer who was not there yet just happened to show up. 
This would have been acceptable if even 70%of their lanes had been in use,  but there were numerous open lanes.   Eventually the frazzled employees allowed us 2 lanes side by side. 

Then we wanted beers,  didn't even consider they wouldn't have any draft beer.   Well they didn't,  but you could get 5 bottles in a bucket with ice for 12$. Disappointing. 

Finally in an effort to get the kids some snacks,  we hit the snack bar....well, the snack stand also rivaled the pace of a sloth swimming through molasses in January. It took 15 minutes to get a pretzel...yep. 

This place is understaffed and under-skilled. If you don't care about waiting,  the lanes are okay (though the balls all were pretty beat up).  I'd find another alley before I'd go back here.  

It's no wonder they didn't have any Saturday night leagues,  no one wants to go there."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bowling alley considering the area. 
Tip: Don't order food from the snack bar. The quality of the food from the lounge/bar is so much better and a much better selection!!"}
{"text":"Not quite as family oriented as it once was but still a safe fun clean environment to relax and have a good time."}
{"text":"Waited 30 min in this line then gave up. 1/2 of the lanes are open but they just have one person at the desk and not getting people to lanes. Really disappointed that we couldn't bowl b/c of their inefficiency. Feel bad for all the folks still waiting! Won't come back."}
{"text":"I went bowling here a few Saturdays ago for the first time. I found it to be clean, fun and very reasonably priced. The lanes were maintained and the electronics functioned properly. They have a lounge/bar area at the entrance separated from the bowling floor, similar to many other bowling spots.

The only negative was the snack bar because they were out of just about everything. If you wanted a sandwich they had no bread, for example. On a Saturday, I would think they would be better prepared. Since none of us ate before coming here, we were famished with very limited choices. No biggie but now I know to eat before I go. 

Overall, nice spot. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is an average bowling alley. Each time we come the ball return does not work and the staff seems annoyed. However they do have automatic bumpers which is nice when we bring my daughter.

UPDATE: I have came here multiple times and each time the ball return gives me problems. I have an 11 pound ball and my daughter has an 8. They say it is because they do not weigh enough but I dont have issues at any other alley.
On my last (and final) visit, my ball got stuck in the ball return on lane 5. The worker had to retrieve it all night. I got it back cracked and chipped. They gave me every excuse in the book and would not do anything for me. I wasn't surprised when I looked for a house ball to finish my game and most of them were chipped too. 
(My boyfriend had this happen once years ago at another nearby alley and they apologized and fixed it for free.)"}
{"text":"Went to get a ball drilled and decided to play a couple games. Lanes are in great shape, fun and reasonable house pattern with good action on the pins. Rich in the pro shop did a great job and his prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to play a specific pinball game (Medieval Madness), and this was the only place that had it. Reluctant at first, I decided to tag along to check out this hole in the wall bowling alley. 

Initially I was not impressed, from the outside it looked like a fallout shelter. It was packed on a Saturday night. almost every bowling lane was taken and we snagged the last one. We grabbed a pitcher of cheap beer and greasy but delicious $4 french fries and had a blast playing for a few hours. 

After that we checked out the arcade (the real reason my bf dragged me along) and he was impressed with the pinball selection. I ended up losing a couple quarters in the machines but the cashier was nice enough to reimburse me (extra star for that one).

tl;dr 10/10 would bowl again"}
{"text":"Once again this lady is rude and picky... She just let 3 people reserve a lane by paying for it and would not let me buy two lanes..... Then got mad cause I wanted 10 games...."}
