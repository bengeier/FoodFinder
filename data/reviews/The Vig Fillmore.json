{"text":"Wow, walked in on a slow Sunday night. Sat at the bar for 8 minutes, there was nobody sitting near me, was totally ignored by the bartender. Got up and left. They would have easily made $50 from me. Worst service ever! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This team remembers the basics--good food and good service. The mahi tacos were great! The sliders were tasty! As for service, ask for Thomas, a top-notch server. GSW"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but food is terrible. There was a painted finger nail in my food. We spoke to the manager and he claimed it was not. Didn't charge us for the meal but still disgusting."}
{"text":"Loved The Vig.  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the people watching and the relaxing space.  The fish tacos were great!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my girlfriends Saturday night. Terrible service. Drinks were ordered and never brought to the table. One minute our waiter is asking us if we're going to \"stick around for a while\" as if it's perfectly fine if that's what we wanted, and the next minute he's saying \"Ladies, We really need this table...\"  I will never go back."}
{"text":"My bad got tossed spoke ecintric love this place feel bad they have always been more than helpful in fixing a mishap was a long day will still be a frequent customer hope you guys didn't take drunk ramble seroius I honest hand to god didn't remember posting."}
{"text":"The owner reached out and apologized for the service. Since then every time I've come to the location downtown or the one on 40th street I've consistently had great food and service. I think that one night was just a fluke. The jalapeño artichoke dip remains my ride or die and I've yet to had someone try that wasn't an immediate fan."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. The first time, everything was just OK and not worth writing about.  Based on others' reviews around the time we visited (March 12), I can only conclude that something was horribly amiss with their workforce.  Our party of 5 was seated quite quickly, but it was in the outdoor bar area.  It was still a bit chilly outside, but patio heaters took care of that, once they found one that worked and wasn't out of fuel.  Service to our table was spotty at best -- our drink orders were taken and processed quickly, but we kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting for the guy to come back and take our dinner orders.  I had the macaroni and cheese, but as somebody else pointed out, it was bland and had that consistency like Velveeta where if you don't eat it while it's piping hot, the cheese solidifies.  The type of pasta they used was not great either -- it was rather stringy and broke into small bits very easily, especially once the cheese had congealed around it.  I managed to eat about half of it before giving it up as a lost cause.  When it finally came time to get the check, our waiter was on his break which added another 15-20 minutes onto our time spent/wasted there.  That's fine, everybody is entitled to a break, but if you don't designate somebody else to take care of your tables when on break, you're going to have unhappy customers -- something that people who work for tips generally try to avoid.  All told, we were there for almost three hours.  Other \"highlights\" from the night (which weren't necessarily the fault of the restaurant but contributed to the overall \"ick\" factor) include: one of the stray cats that others have mentioned was roaming the patio; a party of annoying suburban mouth breathers was seated nearby, where one of the guys lit up a cigar and gagged all of us (we overheard the bartender being told about it, and he chose to do nothing), and one of the girls had such a shrill cackle it would have put Margaret Hamilton to shame; and then the coup de grâce: as we were leaving through the back exit, we saw a literal WALL of garbage piled around the dumpster. Why were we taking the back exit, you ask? Simple: the wrought iron gates at the front entrance were closed and locked (fire hazard, anybody?!) by the time we were ready to leave, which incidentally was nowhere near the posted closing time of 2AM. I can only assume it's to keep the street people from wandering onto the patio, but how about hiring some security instead?  I love The Vig Uptown, and I really wanted to like this one...but I see no reason to return, especially since I'm so close to Uptown and have had consistently excellent experiences there.  The layout and the location of Fillmore both have potential, but the management needs to get its collective...stuff together and offer a better, more consistent dining experience."}
{"text":"I love Vig, especially their nachos and half priced bottles of wine on Sundays. However, I sincerely dislike their indoor seating because this is where all the servers gather to chat, gab, and roll silverware. Management seriously needs to take control of the situation here because it makes me not want to go to Vig when I'd like to sit inside."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous lunch with friends!  The food was delicious and the service from Greyson was unmatched!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere. Love the location within the neighborhood that gives it a great secluded yet exciting touch compared to most places.  Got the Vigazz Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had. Now I did order the burger medium well but by how pink it was, it was definitely a medium rare. By the time I noticed, the burger was to good to complain.  Overall I did love this place and will definitely return"}
{"text":"I go to The Vig Fillmore fairly often as I live right down the street and enjoy myself every time. There is great outdoor seating and is very spacious. I have never sat inside but that seems nice as well.   They typically have good choices of beer on tap and a full bar. I haven't eaten any of their entrees but the \"vings\" and the nachos appetizers are pretty delicious. They do have happy hour specials and I know that they have a half off wine bottle night as well. Overall this place is on the pricier side, but certianly worth it for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time there for lunch. It's great and service is awesome! You must try it for your self."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people are so great.  The food is wonderful. They make the best Mac & Cheese!!  Had them cater a wedding at my home - SAPURBE!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was delish! I had the Vig dip with mac n cheese and the husband had the short rib tacos. After dinner we stuck around to finish our cocktails and played cornhole. Great atmosphere and a lot of fun! If I lived in AZ I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great ambience, food and service. The sandwiches and posole are incredible. Live music on the weekends make this a great place for brunch. Drink menu has a good variety. Restaurant feels spacious, had my small kids with me and didn't feel totally packed in like we were invading other diners space."}
{"text":"I would like to commend the owner who sent me a very professional and sincere apology after my visit at this location. That's the right way to do business. Because of the prompt response, I will be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've  ever had. Bacon wrapped dates were delicious. Excellent service from Justin."}
{"text":"Recently went to dinner at this place and loved it. Their nachos are amazing and their vigazz burger was so juicy. I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Aldavid is AWESOME! Great service great food. Great atmosphere. I would recommend it anytime. The posole is BOMB."}
{"text":"I have been in four or five times now and its pretty consistent.  The service is pretty good, the food is better than expected, and the outdoor patio is great.   This is a short bike ride to my house and a place I'll continue to eat/drink at.  The Dobbsy's  Favorite Item:  Grilled Fish Tacos"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of friends. The atmosphere was the only redeeming quality of this restaurant. Ordered the eggs Benedict and my order came out wrong twice and wasn't corrected the second time. The second time the waitress telling me \"that is what you ordered\". Who orders over medium eggs on their eggs Benedict? Very disappointed with the food and service. In my opinion the waitress should have done more to make my order right."}
{"text":"We've been going to The Vig Fillmore for several years now. I have previously written a good review for them. I have a little bike business downtown and we frequently bring guests to them before concerts at Comerica Theater. Over the past several months, there has been a noticeable decline in service. I have received several complaints. The funny thing is I wrote about this on The Vig's Instagram page today and it was removed. One weekend, my team brought 17 couples to The Vig. These were people attending a concert and did not know where to eat. They would not have been to The Vig if we did not recommend and deliver them.  Some of the staff has a serious attitude problem. The manager appears aloof and detached. She floats about and does not pitch in to help her team. She needs to be removed. Wait times have increased, food delivery times have slowed to a crawl and my reputation for recommending them is taking a hit with every couple I bring there.  I would say stay away until they get their act together. A management change at the Fillmore location is long overdue."}
{"text":"Since moving to the neighborhood 2 months ago, we have become regular patrons of the Vig Fillmore.  Very comfortable, good service and excellent menu. I love the fish tacos!  Despite the crazy summer heat, we find ourselves usually seated outside at the bar under the misters.  As we live close by we usually walk but there is a lot of bike parking and its within easy walking distance from the light rail.  Not sure how to rate parking but the location is in a downtown neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have ate the the Vig many times and it had always been a great experience. Excellent service and great food. This time was a real let down. The food was good as usual but the service was not good and that ruined the whole meal/experience. Chad are waiter was not a 1/3rd polite, or professional as every other waiter/waitress we have encountered at the vig. I am not going to take the time to explain in detail but in short I feel he did not have any interest in representing the Vig in its quality of food and service I have come to expect. He simply seemed concerned about how he could maximize the bill to benefit his tip. I should have dealt with the charges while I was there, but paid and left discouraged that one of our favorite restaurants to frequent let us down."}
{"text":"How disappointing!  The menu apparently just changed and on top of that NO MORE ENDLESS MIMOSAS!  This is my neighborhood, I work, play and eat here. There are so many great options, sadly this is not one. At least the bartender was friendly!  The rest of the staff never said a word to us. That bartender needs a raise!    Oh and if you want a good stomach ache try the tortilla hangover thing. They claim it had pork, but I had one shred of pork. BLEH!"}
{"text":"Kelly Carr at the Fillmore Vig is an outstanding bartender. Her knowledge of spirits and other bevs is fantastic.  Not to mention her great personality and attention to customer service. The food is great at the Vig as is the ambiance but it's people like Kelly who will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about the food here, but there's a great (huge!) patio and I would go for a cocktail or glass of wine anytime :)"}
{"text":"Sadly this trendy joint is crowding next to our most loved Cibo. The drinks and food aren't very good, neither is the DJ. The design is wonderful, making use of an old Phoenix residence and patio. The servers take themselves too seriously, and the yuppies often drink too much. Sports TVs over the bar throws off the trendy -chic of this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple cold beers on the patio with some live music yesterday! Perfect warm weather under the shade. Service was great and the fish tacos were to die for! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best of uptown and Arcadia Vigs. It has awesome indoor, indoor/outdoor and outdoor areas. I love the turkey cranberry sandwich. Great HH or lunch spot. Great location right next to Cibo."}
{"text":"This place is great for enjoying the nice weather, either for a quiet night out with friends or for a delicious brunch on the weekends. So far everything I've tried from the kitchen has been yummy, and the staff is going out of their way to make things right if something comes out a little off (friends' dish was a bit cool, but they remade it again from scratch and it came out piping hot). Parking can be a little challenging if it's busy (thanks city of Phoenix for mining your own people for money with your stupid parking meters), but it's still well worth it to come by for a visit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I came to try out this place on a Tuesday for happy hour and it looked slow. We sat at the bar, we were the only ones sitting at the bar area. Only one gentleman who looked like he was the busboy had acknowledged us and gave us water since literally none of the servers had even looked at us but there were many workers in and out of the bar area serving those who were sitting at tables. After about 20 min the bartender came out and ordered our drinks. So we got our drinks & ordered guacamole and chips. After about 30 min we still didn't have our guacamole & chips and she didn't even come back to see if we wanted more drinks. We were so disappointed we just left 20 dollars to pay for the drinks & left. In that whole hour that we were there we only had one drink each. Never going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service is great. The food, however, is over priced and low quality. I suggest only coming here for drinks.   Also, don't order the ceviche unless you're looking for soupy salsa with a few bits of fish."}
{"text":"This was a great place for sunday brunch. Bottomless mimosas. I didn't km ow what to expect with the food but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very flavorful. Would highly recommend this place and could easily be ok with going back there again."}
{"text":"This review is based off my first and only visit (thus far) to The Vig Fillmore.   I've heard from a couple friends that it's a great place but I knew they always went for drinks at night or in the late evening. Being that I live in the east valley, it's not always easy to make it downtown for drinks so I never bothered to try it.  Today, though, I decided to see what their lunchtime was like and I would definitely recommend it.  It's a really cool little spot and you can drive right by it if you're not paying attention; just look for all the cars lined up for the complimentary valet and you'll be fine.  The atmosphere is casual yet chic and refined. I can definitely see it being an awesome night spot to hang out with friends in an elevated but not stuffy environment. The staff were very friendly and attentive, seating us quickly and bringing waters right away while inquiring about any other drinks we may want. (This was a lunch break, so no go, unfortunately.)   We were able to put our orders in in a very timely manner. They have a few cards from the game Trivial Pursuit sitting on the tables which was a great way to enjoy ourselves until our food arrived. I ordered \"The Vigan,\" which is their vegan sandwich, with sweet potato fries. This is an excellent spin on your customary vegan sandwich but with lots of familiarity. They swapped raw or grilled onions for pickled, and raw tomato for roasted, both of which brought something new to an otherwise common sandwich. There was also a side of some sort of yellow curry dipping sauce which was bright and flavorful and added a unique twist to the dish overall.  My coworker went for the turkey sandwich and had already taken two huge bites before I could ask to snap a picture. Needless to say he was more than happy with his choice. Also, he opted for a salad as his side and unlike most places, they did not skimp on that. Kudos.  I can't wait to go back and try their black bean burger, some appetizers, and several other dishes that stood out on the menu. Hopefully, I'll be able to make an evening trip sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout and have drinks during the day, after work...hell pretty much anytime of the say. The food is amazing and the bartenders definitely know what they're doing. I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and it has been my go to after a long day at work or a relaxing Saturday. The set up is really nice, to turn a house into a full functioning bar and restaurant is pretty awesome. Different from what I'm used to with Old Town bars and restaurants, a good different. This will be a spot I visit frequently!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the better tacos ice had in my life.. I may not know much but I know this place is legit and definitely worth it. Crazy fast service and delicious food ."}
{"text":"Went to The Vig before a Suns game & was so impressed.  Great atmosphere, unique appetizers & entrees.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore nice place, but the wait staff are rude,  feel like they have been given me attitude since I walked in...won't be coming back to this place.   Had to ask multiple times for water and napkins. Not what I expected."}
{"text":"Even in the heat, you can't beat the patio at the Vig at Fillmore. Plus, the service & food are outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is the place you come to when hanging out with a group of friends - awesome atmosphere! I will say I prefer the lunch/dinner menu over their brunch. (Although unlimited mimosas make brunch worth while)"}
{"text":"Make sure you've eaten your meal before you go! I love the newish Downtown Phx vibe. The redone Public Market, Cibo's, etc. When we wanted to go out for a bite last weekend, we ended up at Vig. My sis-in-law had been to another Vig's with good reviews. What could possibly go wrong?  I ordered nachos to share which arrived in an enormous platter -- everything oozing and really beans shouldn't ooze. Note to restaurant, just 'cause it's massive does not make it good. My brother, the meat lover, ordered sliders which he declared inedible. Something about the gristle. My s-i-l had French Dip which was more like little leftover pieces of meat-- from the bone?- squished on a roll. Verdict, not worth the calories. We all liked the sweet potato fries, the ones that weren't drenched in oil anyway.  The outdoor seating looked nice."}
{"text":"After our terrible experience here a few months ago, the manager reached out and we gave The Vig another chance. We had the same server that we had the first time. She immediately recognized us, remembered our drink order, and told us she would comp our appetizer because of our bad experience. (We had said nothing, so the fact that she recognized us from the first time was surprising). Her service this time was great. Drinks were full, waters were refilled, food and plates came out in perfect timing and she was very sweet. Glad we came back and hopefully service will continue to get better because the pasole is amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here as a group for my sisters bachelorette party dinner and really enjoyed ourselves. This was our first time visiting The Vig but doubt it will be our last!  The service was thorough and well paced even for a large group. I had the grilled fish tacos that were both tasty and the perfect amount of food. My sister had the Mac and cheese which was very rich and quite large (not complaining). They also have good drinks and specials. I had astronomy style margarita that had a small hot bite to it from jalapeños.   The final topper was that our waiter offered up free dessert for celebration of the bachelorette. Apparently for birthdays you get a complimentary dessert but he was nice enough to extend this offer to us for our bachelorette celebration."}
{"text":"Love the food but the drinks are always hit or miss.  I ordered a Moscow Mule and it came in the tiniest copper cup, although tasty it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and each time I had a delightful experience. Some may claim the Phoenix has no culinary offering and to them I invite to try The Vig. I've eaten outside exclusively but as the weather heats up I may have to dine inside. Staff are charismatic and well selected for such an establishment.   Bloody Mary bar is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, and great service. Defiantly worth a try! Their food prices average about $10 a plate but great tasting. You can't beat their daily bottomless mimosas (until 2pm)"}
{"text":"This was a first experience at The Vig. My girlfriend and I are road tripping home from vacation and decided this would be a great place to check out. We ordered the carne asada potato pancake dish and split it with a side of sweet potato and regular fries. The food was delightful to the palate and tastefully presented. The service, however, left much to be desired. Our server, Lauren, greeted us promptly but proceeded to ignore our table after we gave our split order. We had to flag her down to ask for lemons, add the side of fries, and for the check while she stopped by all of her other tables to see how they were doing and how their food tasted. We did not receive the same service. It was really frustrating to see other tables receive considerate service and attention while being ignore and avoided."}
{"text":"Went here for a pre-concert dinner, had a great time. Sat outside on the patio across the bar, enjoyed the music coming from the inside. Shared the calamari for appetizers, had citrus shrimp salad and fish tacos for dinner. Both were good, standard fare. What I loved were the drinks...Had about 2 or 3 peach shandys, I was happy :-).   *** left my debit card here (too excited for the concert) and they held it for me for two days until I could return and pick it up!***"}
{"text":"Super disappointed during my visit last night. Made a reservation, on the patio, 2 weeks ago for a dinner meeting... get to the host stand and the host just stares blankly at me and says there's no reservation. Oookkaaay? No apology, no sense of customer service. So we get stuck seated inside which has terrible acoustics, not great for a meeting.  Service was slow, food was ok."}
{"text":"I have been to the Vig numerous times in Arcadia and always have a good experience. I went to this downtown location at happy hour.  The chips that came with the guacamole were old. We asked for new ones...it seemed like they were just reheated. Although, our waiter was very nice and took it off the bill.  The guacamole was great but we couldn't eat it without the chips. In addition, I ordered the steak salad and the steak tasted disgusting....like it had been sitting out or was old. Not sure if it's because it was happy hour or what. Although our waiter was nice the staff is a little unprofessional overall."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this spot for quite some time now so I decided to give it a try. At first, service was extremely slow but they got it together. I tried the black and bleu burger with sweet potato fries. The burger hit the spot. Cool atmosphere and great place to go for a happy hour drink."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is incredible here! Took a date here for a nice but semi-casual dinner and drink before a comedy show and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"When Phoenix was just a one-horse town around the turn of the last century, city planners designed Roosevelt Street to be a grand, chic boulevard, destined to be the \"silk stocking district\" for the city's upper crust. Planning changed and Roosevelt Street never rivaled New York's Park Avenue nor Chicago's Magnificent Mile. Eventually expanding city limits and urban flight left the swank Roosevelt neighborhood a more than a little down-at-the-heels and those aged silk stockings with runs.   Now, a renaissance in the district attracts avant garde artists, quirky shops and boutiques and intimate cafés, giving the 'hood a much-needed transfusion. In the west end of the 'hood, an early pioneer in the 1914 home known as the Cavness House was Palatte. In 2009 Local Breeze took over, only to blow over. The Vig, originally a beloved (and somewhat guarded) secret in the Arcadia expanded their horizons, branching out to create The Vig Uptown at 16th Street near Bethany Home Road.   In September The Vig Fillmore remodeled the old Cavness home, fired up their ovens and set the table. News of their opening spread like wildfire. This location houses the official \"Test Kitchen\" for every Vig. Recipes are created by their youthful, enthusiastic Executive Chef Jorge Gomez (pictured top). Nothing leaves la cucina 'til he says, \"¡Muy bueno!\" He's honed his skills for 15 years, studying at the culinary institute of Puebla, Mexico and in Spain and other local eateries.   Okay, now what about the menu? For starters, the Sonoran Ceviche ($9) is a refreshing combination of pico de gallo, jalapeño and avocado with succulent, tender pieces of whitefish marinated in fresh lime juice. It comes with thick, tasty corn chips.   Their Daily Flatbread ($10) usually calls The Vig \"home\" for a week, since they're always a hit with regulars who hate to see them leave after only a day. Our naan bread was topped with tender chunks of grilled eggplant, tomato garlic sauce, carmelized onion, roasted cherry tomatoes, white cheddar cheese, parmesan and basil. Think \"speciality pizza.\"  Carnivorous? Don't miss out on Chef Gomez' personal favorite, The Prime Vig Dip ($14), where Chef carves up medium-rare sliced beef, smoked gouda, grilled onions, chipotle mayo on a pretzel bun with a ramekin of stout, rich, hearty au jus.  Miss Manhattan? You won't after you have their NYC Reuben ($11). You'll lick your chops for their Guinness braised corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and housemade Russian dressing on rye bread. The meat is hand-carved for each sandwich order so that it's tender and juicy--never dry.. Five more sandwiches round out the selection, including a Black Bean Burger for closet carnivores who are vegetarians. Sandwiches come with a choice of side--don't miss out on the onion rings with a zippy batter.   Five creative salads, like the Southwesterner with Achiote Chicken ($13) and the Lean & Green Steak Salad are available, each one has its own flair you need to check out for yourself. Don't miss out on Chef's own specialties, like a variety of gourmet and street tacos or the fab Posole ($8) that's a \"must,\" especially with cooler weather.  Looks like local restaurants are gonna be battling it out for \"Best Bread Pudding.\" The Vig brings out an enormous serving (about the size of a brick. We're not kidding.) Their dessert includes bananas, walnuts, custard, a luscious butter-rum sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. More than enough to share--if you feel generous. Look for a Sunday Brunch coming this month.   The Roosevelt District may have been the stomping ground for the hoity-toity of the past, but nowadays at The Vig they just serve great food. Not attitude.   The Vig Fillmore 606 N. 4th Ave., Phoenix 602-254-2242  - TheVig.us"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the staff was not friendly though. The hamburgers were tough we complained and nothing was done about it, the waitress was horrible. We paid for our meal I told her \"Thank You,\" and she replied \"bye.\" I felt as if they had rolled out of bed and came to work.....we asked for more condiments they felt like it was chore. Never will return to this Vig."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and did not receive any type of greeting and not even an acknowledgment of my presence. I would have understood if they were busy but there were 7 individuals in the area and it was not a busy time for them. Will not go back, customers apparently are not their primary concern."}
{"text":"First time trying this place but really wasn't in to it the food was to plain the server was to lazy ,other then that this place is not a good place to eat ."}
{"text":"So I was initially impressed that someone from The Vig reached out on-line in response and seem to address the issue I had at The Vig Fillmore. I assumed it was the manager. But, he never messaged me so after two weeks I called The Vig Fillmore and left a voice message. No response. So I called during working hours and spoke to a female host who reluctantly took my information and my contact info ... but kept brushing me off saying the person who responded to my negative review \"was probably from the corporate office\" and she insisted that I go find that information myself. The Vig doesn't get it. Not only do they have a kitchen problem, they have a customer service problem. Clueless staff with zero customer service skills. The Vig and Ladera are all off my dining list ... and I am going to do what I should have done immediately ... report the cold burgers to the authorities and get them to inspect the kitchen. Sorry, you guys failed and failed and failed."}
{"text":"great food and great drinks. the patio was a little on the dark side for my taste, but i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start, but the experience last night at the vig was a true disappointment. Began with waiting at the hostess station without a hostess for some time. We ended up being seated at a two top in the bar area. Waiting about 15-20 mins to get our drink order. Then waited another 20 mins for our food order. We ordered the ahi salad, fish tacos, balsamic potatoes and broccoli. After waiting another 20 mins for food the potatoes arrived raw with balsamic glazed drizzled on them. Then I tried the broccoli which was ice cold. Inside the stems were frozen still. I notified an employee and he took them back to the kitchen. They came back the same way they left, raw and cold. I've tried their Mac and cheese and wasn't impressed as it tasted like velvetta and not a mornay sauce. Honestly, I felt bad for the bartender as he was over worked on what the restaurant owners should have known was going to be a busy night. Stick to the drinks and skip the uninspiring menu."}
{"text":"my son and I stoped off here few days ago and had the porkbelly and watermelon was so so good! You have to try it if you like pork! I have ate here many of times and food and service is always great."}
{"text":"We sat outdoors, which was very nice. I don't know what my wife had, because I was too busy devouring my bacon-filled macaroni and cheese to look at anything or talk to anyone. It was incredible. And I know cheese+bacon is just a no-brainer, but it was seriously better than expected.  The service was good - nothing fantastic but good. The waitress tried to pawn Blue Moon off on me as a hefeweizen (which it is not), so don't expect the best beer selection, but still a great time. It looks like things might get fun in the evenings outdoors, with some kind of outdoor games."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood feel and great atmosphere. Indoor space is reminiscent of other Vig locations but has a great spin in the downtown Phoenix feel."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food! Especially love their appetizers. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Have been to their Uptown location twice and this was first time coming to this location. Will definitely be back again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Today it was my first time going to the vig,and it was awesome chill place, good food and as many mimosas as I can have till 2pm...will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great, classy place!  All of the staff are wonderful and accommodating with phenomenal service.  Our table had a small complaint and it was taken care of professionally by the manager, whom was very cordial. Very impressive with his mannerisms and kindness!       The drinks are delicious and the prime rib sandwich on the pretzel bun is delicious!      Support your local restaurants!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and loved it. I came back with my significant other and we were kind of dissapointed. The service was pretty slow. After everything we ordered and asked for, the waiter asked us if we were sure and we were mildly annoyed by that. Yes, we are sure we want a to-go-box! I had the pad thai with shrimp, which was very good. My cocktail (top of the list, starts with a C...) was also delicious. I wish they still had the grilled lamb belly salad :-( My BF had the Prime Vig Dip, which was very dissapointing and dry. Besides my boyfriend's food, my only real complaint is that they take the food to box it. I had so much left that I was planning on having it for lunch the next day. When I opened it at home, there was barely anything left.  I wonder if it accidentally got tossed and then saved... but that's only an assumption. Overall, it's a nice location for hanging out. We did not hate it but also weren't impressed and will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"Inviting casual atmosphere with welcoming staff. Just had the Lean & Green Salad, would order it again.  If I lived nearby I am sure I would come here at night for drinks and HH."}
{"text":"This is one of the cooler spots in Phoenix that I've been to. My gf and I went a few days ago for happy hour, and I was thoroughly impressed. We ordered some unique cocktails, sweet chile wings, and some guacamole. Everything was spot on, and the prices were quite reasonable. Also, we had a server named Al taking care of us. He was one of the better servers I've had. We'll be back, and I think it's safe to say we found a new spot to be \"regulars\" at."}
{"text":"I've always had just an ok time here. The food was good, took a while to get, and the staff was pleasant. The sliders and fries were tasty. I've never had an overwhelming feeling of delight after I left. I really want to like this place because it's really cute and I luv Vig Uptown, but it hasn't really wowed me yet. This won't deter me from trying this place again. I still would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere was lovely. Went on a chilly night but was kept warm. Will be going back to try the mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch! $3 mimosas n bloody mary's  with THE BEST posole around. Sitting on the sunny, breezy patio December in Phoenix while listening to music and chatting....no wonder Phoenix New Times included it on The Best Patio list!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. Generous happy hour portions. I loved the fish tacos & my husband swears the wings are the best in town. He had the Thai sauce."}
{"text":"As I live three blocks away from the Vig on Filmore which is/has been my go to local bar/pub however the new menu was disappointing and uninspired. Seems like they pared down the menu to their top sellers.  The waitress did not tell of any specials so I wonder if this practice is gone as well. Maybe a new business strategy to focus on drinks?     Recommend they listen to feedback, get inspired and  re-think the new menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, tasty food, and delicious Cosmos!! Several people have told me to check this place out and I am glad We did! Would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Been to every Vig and this is my favorite of them. I like the outdoor bar (probably cause of the previous restaurant Local Breeze and hanging in the same area.) The food is good, I just always feel like it's a bit pricey for what I get for the quality/size. I was sad they didn't have gluten-free buns here though like other Vigs, but maybe cause I was there opening week?  The waitress we had near the inside bar was friendly and willing to check on GF items for me :] always nice when you don't get a \"i don't know\" and blank stare. And...I love that the bartender knew how to make the perfect AMF! Kudos."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Had a great patio, food was great and service was even better.  We had a group of 14 and they accommodated us very well.    Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Very relaxing atmosphere and even better food! I had the short rib tacos and they were amazing. Wife had salmon and she absolutely loved it. Would highly recommend to make a visit to The Vig!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a leisurely meal.  Price is a little steep but very impressive and tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here! Great food and perfect for large parties! Plus trivia on thee table to help time go by while waiting for your food, what's not to like :)"}
{"text":"So the first thing we ordered was the guacamole and salsa. The guac tasted like guac so no complaints (hard to mess that up). But the salsa was about as bland as Sarah Jessica Parker sans makeup. I had to add about a half a table spoon of salt to get any flavor. Then my hot chick sandwich came out accompanied with onion rings and ketchup instead of ranch. Well to sum it up the sandwich was just about as bland as the salsa and the short rib tacos. I had to drown my sandwich in ketchup like Kevin Costner in Guardian to make it bearable. About the only thing that had any flavor was the onion rings and that was most likely attributed to the ungodly amounts of ranch I drenched them in. In closing if you are used to foods with bold flavors, spice or anything not resembling cardboard avoid this place like the Plague."}
{"text":"The food is amazing , everything has so much flavor. service is great inside , outside not so much but nothing too bad . I love this place & I recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago on a double date. Vibe and atmosphere seemed nice. Here's the breakdown:  Pros: *Nice vibe/atmosphere  *Pretty good customer service *Sat outside to wait and provided with iced water during wait *Wasn't a long wait for food to arrive after ordering  Cons: *Originally told wait was 10-15 mins and then it became 25-30 mins  *There was a very large cockroach scaling the wall by our booth. The surrounding parties had to get up and move *Food was very bland  I gathered the place would be good for happy hour because of the atmosphere but I'll never go for a date or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for saturday/Sunday morning brunch. I love the unlimited mimosas special - and they make them just right too!!  The yogurt with granola and dried fruit is surprisingly delicious. They make their granola in-house. Very good if you want a light breakfast.   The ceviche is also very good, although it is a small bowl of it.   I love sitting on the patio outside and I love how the tables have little trivia cards in pepper tins. I definitely recommend this as a weekend brunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Favorite patio downtown. Highly recommend the trifecta which is 3 sliders with pretzel buns. They're addicting! Great place for lunch or happy hour. Sometimes it's hard to find a seat so you may want to call ahead. Also parking can be a bit tricky but they do have free valet."}
{"text":"pretty cool spot. very chill and inviting. ill be back as soon as I'm back in town. try the pazole."}
{"text":"Stop by the Vig with my wife for cocktails & dinner this weekend.  It was a 30 min wait so we decided to dine at the bar. Seat's became available suddenly.    We sat down ready to get our drink and eat on but the white tatto macho bartender decided to completely ignore us.  We weren't rude, loud, or demanding, and have been known to say \"thank you\" way to much in one night.  However, the white tatto macho bartender looked us over and decided that we were not worth his time.   The white tatto macho bartender took orders around, accross from, directly next, and behind us. He didn't make eye contact or acknowledge we were sitting in front of him.  Just in case you don't know the bartender I'm talking about, he is a white male, close fade side hair with a 80's  INSYC  boy band top.  He has tatoos all over his arms, made sure to wear a sleeveless shirt to let the ladies know he has them.  He seemed sureal the way he blatently took orders from everyone but us.  I finaly had enough, there wasn't another bartender at the time to serve the only African American couple at the bar.   I polietly but loudly said excuse me. \"Hold on.\" he said. Walked away like I was bothering him to spend our money. Went over to another customer who has arrived after us and served them.    After serving that customer he started to dart to another customer but I stood up and said \"We were next sir.\"  \"Oh yeah.\" He took our order and made them like the devil told him not to. It was the sloppiest margarita and tito's cranberry you would ever see.   Matter of fact he didn't use tito's so I asked him remake it please. \"I know what I used.\" he replied. My wife of 15yrs can feel when I'm about to hulk out so she asked him iff he would please remake it.  He did but was not happy about it.  While he was making it My wife whisphered \"maybe he's having a bad day.  Tip him, he might cheer up.\"  I've bartended in the past so I know ain't everyday rosy behind the bar, you get real butt holes, I make special effort not to be that butt hole for this very reason.  I do know, as a bartender, you check your attitude at the door, especially when you get a tipper.  I tipped him $10 hoping he would change his attitude and let me enjoy a night out with my wife.  Nope.   I tried to get second drinks by waving a glass,  wife waving a glass, and saying exuse me.  He acknowledged us \"I'll be with you.\" and served someone else.   He even chatted up with a few of them for over five minutes, while we waited for him to get back to us.  After 30 minutes of him ignoring us a second bartender arrived.  Girl with glasses.   She took our order right away.  However, she had to go near the white tatto macho man to get something to finish our drinks.  He leaned in her ear, looked in our direction and they both giggled.  She looked at us too like she heard a bad joke about us.  I was done.    It took everything in me not to get unruly because this was blatant discrmination by that bartender.  I didn't want to ruin our night out by dealing with a blatant racist bartender.  Thank goodness Yelp exists to be able to express consumer business frustrations/mistreatment to people of color that might consider a night out at this Vig.  You've been warned about white tatoo macho man bartender."}
{"text":"Corn beef and hash WOW! LOVE THIS PLACE. From the hip hop funk music to the open atmosphere and the service. The menu is just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"All I can say is AMAZING!!!   The staff and the food.  It was a girls night with the ladies of the family.  Our early Mother's Day outing to a wine n canvas event, then ending it for dinner at The Vig Filmore.  It was my first visit and I am definitely going back.  All our food was excellent and the guys were great!   Thank you for the pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with a large group of adults and teens. The Bloody Mary bar is fantastic! Generous pours of Titos and you get to fix it yourself for $4. Can't beat it. Service was excellent and ambiance was relaxed and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, the vibe is amazing. Last Saturday was my first time trying it out and I had some beer and sweet potato fries with their signature dip (it was delicious!). I'm a fan and will be coming back with friends for drinks."}
{"text":"Ugh seriously this was the worst experience ever. Ordered the poke bowl last night and have serious food poisoning from it now. I don't know what they're doing but whatever you do DO NOT get the poke bowl! Was up all last night vomiting. Not to mention my husband ordered pad Thai with shrimp and they brought it out with chicken, so hey had to remake it so he was just sitting there while I ate my food (which is good looking back on it, at least he didn't eat the poke bowl too, then we'd both have food poisoning). Then they were going to take one of his cocktails off our tab due to the mixup and forgot to. I'm never eating there again. Still feel like complete crap and I'm hoping I don't throw up again today!"}
{"text":"I knew the AGM through a friend. Even if he didn't comp is drinks this place would get 5 stars. The service is great and the drinks are soo good. The prices were affordable and the atmosphere perfection. If I lived in the area I would go back. Great place."}
{"text":"Another go to spot for me for happy hour which is posted next to Cibo. Cool backyard outdoor style area with a full bar. Really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I was here a few weekends ago for the second or third time, and I'm always unimpressed with the service and especially with the food, but the audacity of one bartender made me promise myself to never return.  The bartender was speaking pretty loudly to his friend about a girl sitting across the way with her friends. Publicly discussing her body (and I kid you not) saying \"too much back fat\" and \"maybe the front is better.\" DIRECTLY. IN. FRONT. OF. ME. A woman, a customer, having to listen to this putrid sludge.   Great job, you've hired some gems."}
{"text":"The artichoke, kale, and jalapeño dip is to die for!! Definitely recommended it. My mom got fish tacos which were amazingggg and I don't like fish. I got short rib tacos, which were okay. They were too flavorful for me and had a strong taste. Our waiter was also very friendly and the service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Ain't nothing happy about happy hour. We were having such a great time until the manager Liza came over and told us to be quiet because supposedly we were being too loud during happy hour. They targeted only us when everyone else was being loud too. I feel we were targeted  because of our ethnicity. Besides being targeted, the service was really slow, and they got our check wrong several times. I will never be coming to this place again, and will discourage any friends from coming to this place."}
{"text":"The newest (and in my opinion best) of the Vigs... this one has a nicer vibe and atmosphere than the others- as the entire patio is open and has fun lights. Come on sundays for their bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"Don't use cash!  They round up.  I asked about this and it was explained to me that this ensures that their till is correct at the end of the day.  I had a drink and my bill was $7.60.  I got two dollars in return.  I would have given $1.40 as the tip (15-20%), but I didn't get change. They told me that they don't have change. So, I of course gave $2.00 to ensure the bartender was properly compensated.   This is a great place, just be sure to bring a card!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT AND RECOMMEND IT! I gave a star for each of the following reasons: 1. Free valet parking-They were nice and efficient.  2. Bar-Bartender was speedy and on point with the orders.  3. Atmosphere-The outside cantina feel restaurant style feeling is both cozy and perfect for the warmth of an Az evening.  4. FOOD-We had the app nachos and they were AMAZING! Our server said he'd never seen them devoured that quickly before. The French dip was tasty, we had the yelp recommended fish tacos and the Fillmore burger. Everything was delicious. We did family style eating do we could all try what the Vig had to offer. When I'm in town again I'll definitely come back.  The loss of the 5th star is because we were missing a place setting and had to ask the server for 1, then we had to ask to have our waters refilled, and 1 item was delivered to the table incorrectly. Normal things but it kept me from giving the last star. However, it won't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"The service is great I love what they did with the space it looks amazing. I will definitely be back soon. So glad to have the vig in my hood. The bartenders are awesome and the service is very professional. The food is good, I haven't had everything on the menu but almost. If there is something you don't like they fix it right away.  I come here at least 3 X a week if not more.  Hope to see you there next time."}
{"text":"Not my cup o tea.  Too hipster like.  The place was crowded and loud and the outside bar service was slow.  We sat there waiting for our table to pass the time.  I got some champagne drink that was just ok.  Once seated we ordered 2 apps the calamari, not bad but just basic and over fried.  The second app was spinach dip that was pretty tasty and had some heat.     My main dish was the tuna salad, and the tuna was sour! So gross made me gag rotten fish ewwww.  The chef said that sometimes happens ummmm ewwww.  I sent it back and got the beat salad, this supposed beat salad had a total of 8 beat chunks in it.  Not sure you can call it a beat salad just call it a salad with a few beats and a lump of goat cheese.  My husband got the chrizo burger and said it was amazing but I did not taste it so I cannot judge it.  I did try the mac n cheese super boring nothing special about it tastes like a super charged kraft box mix.     Did not bother with dessert."}
{"text":"I had dinner with The Girls Monday night, it was great! We played trivial pursuit questions- the cards are kept in old spice tins on the tables.  Our server, Kristina  was awesome!  She had a great smile and was very friendly!  Our food was hot and we didn't  have to wait for drink refills. We did not feel rushed and had plenty of time to talk, talk, talk, which was perfect!   We had chips, guac and salsa, yummy! We all indulged in burgers for Burger Monday! Yummy sweet potato fries and the dipping sauces, well they are made fresh every day and they are really delicious! We all shared one of the brownies and it was scrumptious!   Overall great experience,  the staff and ambiance  was great!  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I used to go the one in 16th st, but i was in downtown so I stopped by in this location. I ordered the deconstructed fish taco, which always has been mahi-mahi. As I ate my dinner, I kept thinking that the fish tasted too fishy. I complained about the flavor to the waiter and to my surprise, she told me that the fish tacos contained swordfish instead of mahi-mahi. This should have been updated on the menu. Swordfish is one of the fish with the highest concentrations of mercury. Had I known this before-hand, I would not have ordered it. To me the quality of the food has definitely lowered. This will be my last time that I eat there."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu and the patio is amazing. Perfect for anytime weather is nice. Try the Nachos. Also ask for Jordy and his crock pot recipes. He's an great waiter there."}
{"text":"Finally, downtown Phoenix has arrived and I love it.   I've been here several times on a Thursday and the live music is a definite bonus and tonight was no exception, it was amazing.   Tristan was attentive, knowledgeable and super efficient and friendly. Everything he suggested was PERFECT. The calamari was solid...SOLID.... I could tell you all about the menu, but I say, just see Tristan, he'll steer you to all of the good-good.   The staff overall is not pretentious and really nice. i can't say anything negative about any of  them but Tristan was a standout.   Overall, it's a nice, fun, and casual place. The hipsters are cool to watch and the young attorneys chilling after work are equally entertaining. The patio is one of the very best in town."}
{"text":"I love the location, the food and of course the staff. The inside has a cozy warm setting that's great for a date night or with a couple friends. The outside is beautiful, great for large groups, and with misters that actually do their jobs in this Phoenix heat. The food is great of course, my favorite is the fish tacos and the turkey sandwich. If you're a French fries connoisseur, you have to add these to your list to try, they're amazing! And last but not least, the staff is awesome! Everyone is so friendly and always excited to help with suggestions. Kori suggested I try their pulled pork special for the night and it was definitely top 3 pulled pork sandwiches I've had. This location is definitely my go-to when I'm downtown, I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous & I think the remodel is outstanding! Unfortunately tho, it would have a lovely feel if the crowd wasn't so weak. WTH do these people come from...?   On our way home from a wedding, my friends & I thought it would be great to peep out & get into some late night bocce ball because it's right here in our neighborhood...right? Nope,Totally wrong.  The crowd was everything but fun. I mean seriously...after our first round of Bocce, a small group arrived & decided it would be ok to hang out on the green, then had the audacity to tell us we were being rude b/c we threw the ball in their direction \"aggressively.\" Ha- It was so absurd the lack of etiquette combined with attitude refusing to step off the green & antagonizing a fight with us to top it off. I had to get security.  Bocce balls were about to go though some heads.  I don't know, but maybe installing a fence along the green near the bar may help guide immature bar crowd to stay on the patio...?  Considering the selection of restaurants & bars in this area, It would be safe to say I most likely will not be returning. I mean for reals...the Vig is known for having a Bocce court. These people were beat."}
{"text":"I have been here few times I  love love the sweet potato fries ! The fish tacos are really good and burgers but the sweet potato fries are the ones that keep bringing me back !!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and it's always a great experience. Love their weekend brunch! The mimosas are on point and you can't beat that price. They have some fun games in their patio & a large bar there, so you don't have to go inside to order drinks. Perfect sport for large groups! Only con is the parking situation, but aside from that great service & good food!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out the Vig, now that it had taken over a much-needed restaurant/bar spot that serves the area where I work. I'm sorry to say that while I'm sure it would be a great place to relax on the patio with a cocktail, I was vastly disappointed with the food. I came with a large group for a simple birthday lunch. We were crowded together at a too-small table, despite having made a reservation. The service was unbelievably slow. The vegetarian options on the menu were limited. However, when I asked them to make my dish with tofu instead (which you would think screams vegetarian preference), it still came out with shrimp and an egg. We had waited so long for the food that I let it go and simply shared the shrimp and suffered the egg, but I definitely wouldn't come here for food in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and had no complaints. Food was good, patio was beautiful, service was to expectations. However, I went back just recently and was not pleased. My two friends and I were not greeted by anyone at what looked like a host stand and stood there for a good five minutes, while servers just stood at the door to the building not looking our way. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table. Almost all had reserved signs which is fine, but with that situation I expect someone to seat us. Once we sat, a server came up and asked if we had just \"walked in\" and if we needed menus. We said yes, of course, but then she proceeded to tell us that the table was reserved and that any other table would be fine and she would be right with us. We found the only other empty table, and shortly after we sat a man that was with the large party reserving all the tables informed us that that table was reserved as well. I do understand that it is fair for a large party to be dining at the restaurant but I felt as if staff was not paying attention to anything other than that. Frustrated and impatient, my friends and I left.  I am hoping this is a once time instance because I know The Vig can do better than that and I don't want to miss out on their awesome food."}
{"text":"Love the out door patio foods good great atmosphere frendly  bar tenders i cone here oftrn cant complain"}
{"text":"I have always gone to the Arcadia 40th street location, but living downtown a group of us decided to try Fillmore.  I love the location hidden in a neighborhood the bar is warm and chic, brunch was very good and service was on point.  I had the breakfast sandwich with aioli it was very good the potatoes  weren't my favorite but to be fair country style potatoes aren't my favorite anyway others had hash browns that looked better.  Bacon was very flavorful and good cuts.  I highly recommend ! Vig Fillmore"}
{"text":"Here on vacation and this place was amazing. Came for brunch and had the enchilada de polo and the Early Bird and Beachcomber Drinks. Food came out fast and drinks were amazing. The staff I interacted was nice and gave recommendations to a traveler wanting to try something new. If I come back to Phoenix, I will be sure to come back here"}
{"text":"If I could could give zero stars I would!  most racist place ever Brandon took our ordered of drinks they only sent us one and they took three other people's orders gave them their stuff and we're still sitting here waiting Brandon is so inattentive worst experience of my life do not recommend at all if you want to have a good time go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have now been to the Vig a handful of times because my hubs likes the vibe & outdoor seating. We went on their anniversary for the good deals on the tasty treats & cocktails. I loved my Coronado Cup & the pork flatbread on special that night. First thing I had here that I really, really, really, enjoyed. The hubs liked the burger previously. Had the guacamole/chips late night menu & it was delish.  That's why the 3 stars. The food, cocktails, patio & service by almost everyone is great! My only bitch is a big one in my book & it resides with the long dark haired bartender. I've had him a few times now & caters to his buddies/co-workers & local bar staff that visit him late night. . My beer was EMPTY for 13 minutes while he made shots for his buddies/co-workers & practiced drinks on them.13 minutes  for a beer this is ridiculous on a Sunday evening at 10:45 p.m. with an empty patio & restaurant & an almost full bar. The only reason I timed it was because he's done this before to us & frankly I was curious. He mixed drinks next to us & never turned his pretty lil' dark long haired head around to serve us. No joke! He's the only bartender/server that I've had issue with at all here but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Ruins the experience completely for me. Not because I'm so important but because everyone else in the restaurant is that much better... There are too many gastro pubs around downtown to darken the door of one that doesn't treat everyone equally with great service. This bartender when he's paying attention to you is really good. He knows what he's doing, is quick & has a lot of personality. But when he's sidetracked by friends/co-workers don't expect a thing. Not even a beer refill cuz that sadly isn't happening. :("}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Tracy is my favorite bartender she is such a nice person and a great server/bartender! Honestly I have never had bad service here and I've been there a million times because I live les then a block from the restaurant"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and came with a party of 10 for lunch.  1st thing, atmosphere is amazing. They have a nice outside bar with TV's all around and plenty of seating area outside.  Servers where very attentive and on top of orders/ drinks.  Food was delicious, all 10 of us where very impressed with food, décor, and service.  Looking forward to coming back in the very near future."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty my meal was! Ordered the black bean burger with a side of roasted cauliflower. Both were great--the black bean is so filling you don't even miss the meat! Just found the whole staff set up somewhat odd; arrived for a late dinner on a Sunday night and there was no hostess to tell us where we could (and apparently, couldn't, sit)"}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore became my favorite downtown Phoenix restaurant while there for business the whole week. While it was a 5 min uber ride from the convention center and all the restaurants in that area it was so worth it!  It was so awesome, I went there for lunch and dinner, bringing my team to the wonderful outdoor respite of the restaurant. The patio is perfect for a relaxing afternoon, with water misters to keep you cool from the Phoenix heat. The appetizers are all great, including the guacamole and Thai-flavored wings. They offer a nice selection of entrees, including meat, seafood and healthy options. In addition, the cocktails are perfect for the time of day, be it a Moscow mule, mimosa or wine/beer.   This is going on my must visit list every time we go to Phoenix so definitely add this to your list!"}
{"text":"Lets set the stage, birthday lunch for a good friend. we  go to the Vig because it has a nice outdoor misted patio & we like the food and drinks.....we get booted from a table that was \"reserved\" that no one ever showed up to. The misters got shut off, its hot, asked four times to turn misters back on and not even a response. Lunchtime on a Friday and there's two servers. Who's running this place? Bad planning and execution. Food was decent, drinks good too. We would have stayed for more but our requests were ignored. Get it together Vig. theres lots of competition vying for everyones business, Of which mine I'll take elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I love this location. The patio is beautiful and the service is impeccable when it comes to the wait staff. The food is also great. They have a wonderful happy hour and you definitely get your money's worth when you go in."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great.  Atmosphere is very chill as well!   Frequently come here! What can I say????"}
{"text":"Service was great but the pear burger was ok, I came here with my husband for an early dinner; maybe I was just too hyped up about it but it was quite dry and nothing too special about it. Defiantly wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had and I'm LOOVE burgers, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Reluctantly returned to the Fillmore Vig for a mandatory office Christmas party.  The service was better this time being in a large group, but the food was severely lacking.  Our \"spread\" consisted of a fruit tray resembling something you could pick up at Costco, bland hummus and cold pita bread, and something I believe was intended to be sandwiches but really they were just 5 inch thick buttered buns cut in half with something unrecognizable slapped in between.  Again, very bland.  I have yet to figure out what everyone loves about the Vig.  There were heat lamps out on the patio so scorchingly hot I thought my flesh was melting off of my face standing 2 feet away.  The only positive thing I can say is that the wine/drinks were decent."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have brunch! Food is amazing, mimosas special is good! the idea of a Bloody Mary bar is so cool! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Literally sat in our booth for more than 15 min before anyone even came to our table. The waiters just walked passed us and waited on the tables next to us. The sign up front said grab a menu and seat yourself. There were no menus to grab. The bartender came from behind the bar to wait on the table next to us and did not offer us a menu or asked if we've been helped. Will it be coming back."}
{"text":"I love the downtown vig. They took over Local Breeze if you were downtown before it was \"cool\" and they did a great job. On Monday's they do a $5 cheeseburger special that you just can't beat. Pretty decent beer selection. They usually have more draft selections inside if you ask too. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I tried the fish tacos at this Phoenix restaurant.  I thought they were mediocre at best.  Not bad, but not great.  They were quite spicy which I like, but not when it masks and overpowers the other flavors.  The atmosphere was decent and laid back.  I felt the crowd was mixed.  There were 20 somethings as well as seniors dining when I was there.  The service was adequate.  While I would not mind returning here, I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Waiter was very rude. Wasn't willing to separate check because it was going to take her 10 minutes. Gratuity was included so we were forced to tip her for her rudeness. Thanks blondie."}
{"text":"very similar to the vig arcadia. great atmosphere, although it does lean towards the hipster side. My own experiences are with the brunch and I think that's the best time to go. Very laid back atmosphere. Weekend brunches also have good discounts on beer and a bottomless mimosa special.   The bacon was something that stood out to me. I liked it so much I even ordered extra as a side.   Downsides are slow service and I think the food is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"if i could given less stars i would. Our party came in yesterday 4-24-18 at 8:30pm it was 11 of us and we had made reservations. It was my first time there, i understand being a server is a very hard job as i am in the customer service industry as well but this was terrible! the server was a female i did not get her name but she seemed very annoyed and short with us as soon as we got there. She never refilled water or asked if we needed anything else she even ruined our friends birthday surprise cake by asking about it out loud when we had already said it was a surprise.She never came back to check on us so we had to ask for our tabs, if we where shady people we could have left without paying and no one would have noticed .I was completely confused the reviews are so great but service was just terrible. We all could have left a huge tip for her if she would of just been nice and actually served us."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is probably going to be my go to restaurant. I have been there twice and the service has been great. The food has thus far been incredible and the prices are very reasonable for the amounts of food you get. I prefer the indoor to patio but that's just a personal preference. I think most people will leave the Vig very satisfied."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. Unfortunately also a bunch of loud drunks who had no consideration for the fact that must of the other patrons could care less for for obnoxious behavior. Too bad, this might be worth trying again. But unless the staff takes some responsibility to insist that people be a little more courteous to others trying to enjoy their evening I think I'll pass. It is good but not that good"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Ive been going here for years then I moved to Kentucky and I miss it so much. I've had dates here, I've gotten take out here, and I've taken my favorite teacher here for lunch.  I HIGHLY recommend the vanilla braised short rib tacos.  But the best and I mean THE BEST thing on this menu is the shrimp Pad Thai with extra lime. With a big ol peace of bread pudding. So amazing.  The servers know you by name, everyone is so nice and accommodating. And the back patio is amazing."}
{"text":"The Vig has a couple locations, but I've been to the one on Fillmore twice. The outside seating is much nicer than inside. Once the weather cools down, I would suggest sitting out back. Inside is dark and very small.   The \"Takes Two to Mango\" drink on the Happy Hour menu was good & sweet. And \"The Trifecta\" sliders were delicious. The fries are addicting.   Overall the restaurant has a hipster, casual vibe. I will be back, but I'll probably try a different location."}
{"text":"This was a very cute place in Phoenix with great indoor and outdoor seating, live music, and a nice ambiance. I went in and was seated immediately. My server was very attentive and friendly and did not seem To be rushing us at all. My only complaint is that the menu was a bit more limited than I would have liked. I ordered the calamari, and it was extremely well seasoned and not at all rubbery. Definitely check this place out for a quick bite with friends! I'll be back soon to try their brunch."}
{"text":"New to Phoenix and great place adjacent to downtown.  Located in older home with great ambiance indoors and outdoors.  Outdoor bar to appreciate an happy hour in the glorious evening winter weather of Phoenix,.  Attentive staff and good food with a calmness.  Free street parking,  food good.    Waiter forgot to mention meat on a recommended dish when ordering served a teaspoon not properly clean.but freely replaced once recognized error and gave some credit on bill for inconvenience.  They  are interested in customers!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome!  Came here with a group of 8, at prime dinner time, and was quoted a half hour to 45 minute wait.  Not a big deal for us since we weren't in any hurry.  However, we were pleasantly surprised when seated only after 20 minutes.  Our server was attentive and very nice.  He even split up our checks and let all of us use our Localdines coupons we had!!  Thank you!!  I got the black bean burger and it was amazing!!  Tons of flavor and our server suggested I get the mixed fries of sweet potato and original and that was a great suggestion!!!  A little bit of everything!  We sat inside at a part that looked like a sun room.  It was extremely clean and classy and felt really comfortable with our big group.  The outside looked really nice too but we didn't have a chance to experience that.  Valet parking is complementary in the back between The Vig and CIBO.  Which is a total PLUS!  Parking is so hard to find downtown.  We will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore is a place I frequent for happy hour because of their great food and  drink and food deals before 6:00. It's a cute little house setup and a yard with a tiki bar so there are a lot of options for seating. Last night I had dinner there for the first time. I got the black bean burger on a pretzel bun and a side of brussel sprouts-AMAZING. I will now recommend The Vig's dinner as well as their brunch and drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here already several times, today being my fourth or fifth and I plan to come back over and over.  Their food is memorable and delicious, service is prompt and friendly and ambiance is relaxed, hip yet inviting.  They were accommodating to me and my elderly mom and two kiddos and that was awesome today.  Their cocktails are lovely. Today's was the cold Brew old fashioned and it was DELICIOUS, completely unexpected combination and makes me want to experiment and make it a at home since I love both of those things individually!  My fried chicken sandwich today was amazing. I think my eyes rolled back a few times as I bit in to it. That Curry side sauce was the craziest accompaniment to a fried Chicken on ciabatta sandwich and it worked so freakin well. I'm so glad I went for it! Amazing.  My kids burger as very tasty. I stole a bite or two. The onion rings were yummy.  Overall it was very enjoyable... even waiting a bit to have lunch on a busy Saturday with two kids, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit... Definitely want to come back again."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite patio in Phoenix. The Vig Fillmore is it. It screams \"day-drink here!\" or \"Brunch/Sunday Funday!\" or \"I love Phoenix in February\"!  Surrounded by a nice looking, large wood fence, landscaped neatly with fake grass and small bushes and plants, newly-planted trees and surrounded by large established trees, it's an urban oasis that I wish was my own back yard. Like others have said - I can't say I've ever sat inside - because I love being outside so much.  The patio boasts a large covered bar in the middle, complete with TVs for your game-viewing pleasure. As well, there is an area for cornhole and some large Adirondack chairs to lounge in and enjoy the day.   To make things even better - they have a great happy hour from 4-6pm. There is chips & Guac, wings, and my favorite - 3 sliders on pretzel buns with fries for $5 each. The sliders are fairly large and I end up taking a box to go each time. The fries are amazing - seasoned, shoestring - cripsy but soft. A Kiltlifter will run you $3.50. Not a bad deal for dinner and a beer.   Brunch - is the best. On the weekends - they offer a bottomless mimosa option for $15. I like the Encanto Enchiladas so much, I have yet to stray from them at brunch. Anything with crema and tomatillos on it sounds amazing to me.    For dinner the Deconstructed Fish Tacos are a nice healthy option - a big chunk of Mahi Mahi and amazing beans on the side. I also like the Cavness House Salad - which is like a Cobb salad with a few extras.   My biggest complaint about this place is the parking. It sucks. They do offer a complimentary valet in the back between Cibo and here - but for some reason I'm valet-averse and would rather just park on my own. The good news is the meters are off by 5. The bad news is - you still probably can't find a space. And driving west on Fillmore makes drive around a very large block to get back. So beware.   Overall, I really love this place and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"It is a very good restaurant and they have the best burger in town. I strongly recommend this place and the service is great and also always friendly faces"}
{"text":"LOUD!! Music is always loud even on a Saturday or Sunday morning or early week night evening - I don't get it.  The staff has always been very friendly, attentive with good food and a good beer selection. I just don't want to go somewhere where I can not have a conversation.  Ear deafening sound almost every time we've been here.  Now we do a sound check by just driving by and if we can hear the music in the car it's a no go."}
{"text":"Great fun place in downtown. Very nice outside patio & bar. Went for lunch with my wife today. Had a decent bottle of wine for $11 yes $11. Half price bottles in Sunday. Shared Nachos with added carnitas. Very good, and filling, that was all we needed. Total bill with tip was just $32 and I got $1.82 cashback from Yelp. Great deal. Outside disc jockey added to the fun. Very nice service. Everything was good, young crowd probably averaging 25-30 made me feel a bit ancient, oh well. Only negative is the parking. I may have missed it, but they don`t seem to have any, so had to street park about 2 blocks away. I probably needed the exercise anyway and it was a nice day in the 80`s so it was all good overall. Will return. Hopefully some of you oldies out there will read this and go there too, so I don`t feel so ancient next time."}
{"text":"Awesome appetizers and cocktails and great service. They even let us split our check nine ways."}
{"text":"We just happened to stumble across this treasure.  Everything was amazing-the hot artichoke, kale,jalapeño dip was to die for and the best burger I think I've ever had. The service was excellent even though it was somewhat busy. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I love eating at The Vig Fillmore! The service is always excellent! They have indoor and outdoor seating! The outdoor space is amazing! Trees, lights, fireplace, misters, heat lamps, bocce ball, outdoor bar, outdoor TVs... You can sit outside year around! My favorite food is the Mac and Cheese! It's the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had, hands down! Also, they have the best moscato in the valley! Highly highly recommend The Vig Fillmore!"}
{"text":"Very great place I loved the food and the servers were amazing! Wish they had a bigger inside especially for this time of the year but overall I will be back and really recommend this place to anyone, younger crowd for the most part being near ASU and well worth the drive from Tempe"}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of buddies for brunch today and was pleased to see the nice layout in this sweet, historic spot.  The place was packed !!  We ordered good food ( Benedict and. Monte Carlo with wonderful coffee) and spent a couple of hours catching up.  Had it not been for the sub-par service, this would have been a solid 4 or 5 experience.  Our server bypassed us numerous times, forgot cream, and wasn't as good as he could have been.  I had no complaints other than that, though.    Service is especially important when the heat has hit and people are hungry.  Tell that waiter to step up his game!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of fellow runners after the recent Phoenix 10K and Half Marathon and was very disappointed. The patio filled up while we were there so clearly they do a lot of brunch business, but you wouldn't know it from the lack of service we received. Our server appearances were few and far between. I was able to at least get a beer, but the food we ordered arrived at various different times and she never returned to see if anyone wanted anything else. Having just finished running 13.1 miles, I wasn't ready to order immediately and our server never checked to see if I wanted to order later. Considering how long it took for everyone else's food to come out, it wouldn't have been worth it anyway. I've enjoyed visits to the other locations of the Vig, but this one was very disappointing and I would not return."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for a Sunday brunch with friends. Been here a couple times when I was in town and it's been one of my favorite spots so far. They have a great menu selection for whatever you're in the mood for and to top it all off, $4 Tito's on Sundays! You can order a $4 Tito Bloody Mary Bar. It's ahhhmazing. Can I have some bloody mary with my bacon?  Loved everything we ordered, they also have great coffee for those coffee snobs. The only thing I do not like so much are their sweet potato fries. Both times ordering them, they were too soggy for my taste. But I love their greek salad which is what I always order.  Great service both times, love the atmosphere of this place. During Spring, there is DJ/live music in their patio area around 10am, which makes the place super fun. There is also an outside bar. Too bad it's so freaking HOT in the Summer that it's pretty much impossible to sit outside at all."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised when I walked into this oasis. Nice courtyard with water mist, spinning good tunes, and great waiter who is always on.    Great wine by the glass selection - ended up getting the Vig sauvignon blanc and it's solid.  Pozole soup is excellent: traditional mexican soup with grain, onion, pork, avocado. I had it in new mexico.  I like this particular one because there isn't too much grain and had a bit of a kick to it.  Garlic soy edamame: super big portion.  Could benefit from a bit less sauce or extra sauce on the side.   Fish taco: delicious and fresh.   Great spot to check out,  especially for a late night meal after 10.30pm."}
{"text":"I love brunch. I love The Vig. Therefore I loooove brunch at The Vig! Such a delicious eggs and Benedict they have. It is my favorite. Alongside their potatoes you cannot go wrong. I believe they use a creamy Chipotle hollandaise sauce and some wilted spinach too. It is so pretty and delish. I have to say their bottomless mimosa deals on Sundays are also great!"}
{"text":"We went to the VIG on Saturday and had the hangover helper and the chicken enchiladas. The chicken enchiladas were pretty good with a nice developed sauce. The hangover helper is more like a layered baked tortilla cassarole that is a cool gimmick but way to heavy if you do not have a hang over. We really liked their bloody mary bar. Overall the food service was quick and professional but the food was lacking in flavor and depth for one of the dishes. We plan on trying it again for dinner in the near future. Side note we left when we saw a party of 10 with lots of little ones coming in for a children's birthday party. We did not know they did children's parties but I guess business is business in the land of the sun when 113 is the high temp."}
{"text":"Best Veggie burger I've veer had! And they have gluten free buns! Great service. nice ambiance, and good location if you are hitting the town afterwards."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place more stars as the food is really good but the service is lacking.  We were seated in the bar and waiting over 15 minutes for service.  We had to go see the hostess to get a server.  The bartender arrived and apologized for the delay and assured us we would be well taken care of.  We ordered our meals and though they did come out quickly, the variations we requested (i.e substitutions) were not made so the meal was not what we ordered.  Not wanted to complain, we ate what we were served.  As stated above, the food is very good (The Vigazz burger is delicious as well as the chicken sandwiches).  We will continue to dine there but if the service remains lackluster, we may may find other alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped by Saturday for an early dinner on the way to roller derby. Parking is a bit of a challenge but, we got a spot on the street right in front. It's located on the corner or fillmore and 4th ave and blends perfectly into the neighborhood.  We were greeted at the door and choose to sit at the outdoor bar/patio area. It has a great open, yet comfy feel with lounge chairs, high tops, and regular tables surrounding the bar. A fireplace and outdoor games also dot the landscape. A real cool vibe. We sat and drinks came quickly. The menu was not large but, had a very diverse selection. Burgers, mac n cheese, tacos, salmon, etc. We opted for the chicken nachos and blackened fish tacos. Nachos were piled high with guac, blk olives, cheese, refried beans and salsa - very good! The four street fish tacos also hit the spot with a little heat and a fantastic crema on the side. Staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, we loved this place and are eager to stop back and relax by the fireplace, have a few drinks and enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"We tried The Vig Fillmore before going to a concert at the Van Buren. The location was close enough to Lyft to dinner and then walk to the venue for the show, so we were excited about our outing. Unfortunately, the service was poor, and then one of our orders was completely wrong when we finally got the food. My husband got to eat his meal while I watched and waited for mine to be fixed. Then he was treated to waiting on me finish mine... The food was tasty, but the service wrecked it for us."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and couldn't be more delighted! Sunday afternoon chilling at the bar listening to live music...Tristan, the barman, made us feel so welcome and helped us pick the correct wine and food. The Riesling from Mosel was chilled to perfection and went well with  the Vanilla Rib Tacos and onion rings."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Had the wedge salad and a few beers. I will definitely comeback again!"}
{"text":"Really decent service even when they're busy and I am not with a group! The mimosas are prepoured and weak... unless you ask for more bubbles ya might get mostly oj from concentrate. But they are accommodating when you ask. First service of food was a failure: soggy Monte cristo ...a ham egg chez  sammich on French toast. Mine was soggy and included a side slice of inedible dry whitish pineapple. I hated having to send it back bc I could tell how good it could be if the toast was toasty and not soggy. They were great about getting me another meal. It is taking forever thoughhhhhhhhhh."}
{"text":"Okay so I've been coming to this VIG location even before it \"officially\" opened.  I will say that I have never been to another location. So i'm just basing my experience on this location and this location only.   I am a bit spoiled because I live in walking distance as well.   The patio is amazing, during the beautiful weather days this is THE spot downtown to be. At night they have heaters both the propane and electric ceiling units mounted above the bar/patio for chilly days/nights.   The service for me has always been on point. Very quick, timely, polite, and never lacking when it comes to a drink refill or a suggestion (food or drinks) also great at informing specials.   Monday nights they do $5 burgers, which are cooked to ones liking, i prefer mine med rare.....YUMMY.   Beers are usually around 3-4 dollars depending, can't beat it. Cheaper on one of their many special nights.   Weekends they do brunch and their brunch is amazing, I've had a burrito here with a bloody and it was sooooo good, I walked home and took a nap. Damn thing put me to sleep.   Sundays they have half off wine bottles and bottomless mimosas ($15) from 11-2.  Basically if you are downtown, this is THE place to stop in.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Blackened fish tacos with a side of green chili.  very good. I love lime so I need d extra for the 4 tacos. Our app was the guacamole and salsa, the flavors were so amazing. I was happy with my meal! Oh yeah, the Bloody Mary - can't go wrong!! The waitress was very sweet and had top notch serving capabilities. But I forgot her name"}
{"text":"Had friends in town from Los Angeles that wanted to go out for drinks. The weather was beautiful Saturday night and we sat outside next to the bar. My my friends raved about how nice the grounds were in the lighting was perfect. The drinks were fantastic the artichoke dip was fantastic the chips were a little too salty though so the waiter brought us Pita bread. I had the ahi tuna salad which was perfect and my wife had a dinner salad with chicken.  Our friends had the fish tacos and the tri tip salad and all I heard was yummy yummy. Hey great place to go and relax for the evening. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location I have an awful experience....  The wait to get drinks, food, or any kind of attention was just insane.   None of us enjoyed our food...Let's just say none of us wanted to take left overs home. I do not understand how can food taste so much better at Up Town location? People we are talking about food here, not atmosphere. Get it together Fillmore....  Even though I like atmosphare and vibe at this location better, I am  not sure if I ever want to go back. Too bad"}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT food and lots of drink choices. There are always a selection of beers on tap and the wine list is nice and long. The guacamole is no joke THE BEST I have ever tasted. I also had an amazing burger on another visit. In the morning/afternoon, they have a Bloody Mary bar where you can make your own bloody with top quality ingredients. Prices are a little high but it's worth every penny. Happy hour prices are the best! Love this place and only been a handful of times."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was not so good the hostess said there was no setting in the patio but when my daughter showed her the yelp app she said that they don't use it much because it said there was setting she said there was nothing available but then changed her mind I thought that was pretty odd. Then our waiter was to busy never really came back to see if we needed anymore drinks."}
{"text":"Popular place during happy hour, totally worth the wait. They have a great selection of beer and cocktails. Nice happy hour menu too! Their apps are delicious, but my favorite was their burger! One of the best burgers I've ever had!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe but the service outside is slow and if you sit at the bar it isn't much better. Happy Hour was almost over and neither bar tender would come to the side we were sitting. I got up, walked around the bar and stood politely as he continued to gab on w someone else. When he finally acknowledged me he said he'd have my bill ready in a moment. NO DUDE, I WANT A DRINK!! Food and drinks were great. Service? Not even close."}
{"text":"Every experience here so far has been positive.  Except, maybe, for how easy it is for me to run my bill up sky high on drinks and food over the course of an hour or two -- because I want all the foods and drinks!  This place is comfortable, laid-back, and the bar has TVs on all four sides, so if you're looking for a chill spot to watch the football games, etc...this works (although fills up fast).  And the TATOR TOTS...omg.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Weekend brunch service is extremely slow, forgetting the app is bad....the tres leeches French toast was very dry which doesn't make any sense. Huevos rancheros were the only redeeming quality here..."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this location and both experiences were horrible! The first time my waiter was a complete hipster douchebag who made me feel like an idiot because I didn't know what bottomless mimosas were, innocently I've never heard that term so I did what any inquisitive person would do and asked. Was he nice about it? No! He teased me the whole time and posted it on Facebook where his loser hipster buddies can laugh at me. Second was when I was summoned to a business meeting with a new client. The dinner was nice and the service was better this time, however, at the end of my meal as I'm ready to pay I notice a chewed up piece of bubblegum on top of my plate. I asked everyone at the table and seriously doubt a new client of mine would dare place their chewed up gum on my plate. The manager spoke to us and very apologetic and as I was leaving he handed me a gift card for $10. I guess I'm not hipster and loser enough to dine at The Vig in downtown."}
{"text":"The Vig is definitely a social scene more than anything else. They have some pretty above average dishes however the atmosphere is probably why it is so popular. It is very trendy and dark but I would NOT recommend sitting inside. I give the restaurant 4 stars because of how loud it is indoors. If you can definitely opt for the patio seating if you want to have an actual conversation with the person next to you!"}
{"text":"Got the chance to try it out again, and it was so good! A really nice atmosphere for brunch on a Saturday. The food was so yummy and our waitress was really sweet. The live music and $3 mimosas were just the cherry on top! Definitely found a fun new spot. Thanks so much Logan!"}
{"text":"We had really great service! Our waitress as well as several other people checked on us to make sure we were doing okay! Really liked the food (wings, nachos, and salad) and the cocktails as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix! I have never had any food off the menu that I didn't love! Delicious drinks as well! This is also a great place for parties or get togethers on the patio. The service can be hit or miss but the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food here was yummy. We sat in the bar area. The service was great. I think sitting outside when it's not summer would be cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last Saturday for dinner. We sat outside on their cute patio. Patio has an outdoor bar, fireplace, and heaters. Real cute. I ordered the flank steak that came with fries. It was really good but wish it came with beans or rice and not fries. Food prices were great. Great atmosphere, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This probably has to be my next best brunch location for a while. Form the service to the FOOD everything was great. I will be stopping by for sure and bringing in more of my friends and colleagues to this very special spot."}
{"text":"I went on a sunny Sunday. The Bloody Mary bar was excellent. So many extras to add I can't even count. Hanging out outside with the Sun is fantastic. They had some DJs which were pretty good too. It reminded me of Chicago. I had the Fillmore burger. it was cooked to perfection and the best hamburger I've had in years. The fries were pretty good too I was at a birthday party and people ordered a variety of brunches they all said they were great. The bartender was cute and friendly. I would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"An excellent happy hour or dinner spot tucked away in an historic neighborhood in downtown Phoenix. They have an excellent variety of cocktails, each with a modern twist. Happy hour specials won't disappoint. Trendy, unique atmosphere with great views of downtown Phoenix. I always try to sit near the outside bar on a cool, breezy day - it's feels like you're relaxing in your own backyard.  Food and service are top-notch. Try the pork nachos and fish tacos!"}
{"text":"The Vig is the perfect spot to relax with a glass of wine and late night snack after a show downtown.  My husband and I tried it for the first time last night and were seated on the patio.  Love the ambience.  Late nights they have a limited menu, but a good selection.  The nachos were great - worth a try.  The wine selection was broad and both reds we tried, were luscious.  Our server, Chad, was personable and attentive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the patio. Service is normally pretty good. I'm a big fan of the Vigan sandwich.  My only issue is flies. Both at this location and the Uptown one we've encountered a lot of flies while dining outside during our meals??"}
{"text":"I have a hard time giving more than two stars seeing my eggs Benedict was served cold with hard yolks. If my food had been warm with runny yolks I would be more generous with my stars. Just can't do it with cold eggs Benedict:("}
{"text":"LOst in PhOenix and lOoking fOr a late dinner, an advice sent me to the VIG.  Wasn't there for an ambiance but for fOod and i finally had bOth. I went for a Pad Thai Shrimp bOwl. Really nice but it came on a family size! Brought back half on a doggy bag which finished offerwd to an hOmeless personn on the street. I also had a  glass of wine Reberly. And repeated it with the brOwnie desert (shared with my cOlleague but nOt finished either!)  Gret place to stay, i believe it might be crowded during the weekend.  I'll definitively come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Great patio to hang out at when it's not too cold out. And even if it is cold, they have plenty of heat lamps.  Most of my stars are for the atmosphere alone. Very hip/trendy without being pretentious. It's easier to find parking here than at other places downtown. The food menu is a weird mix of everything with so-so execution. None of the appetizers we ordered were particularly rave-worthy. Reasonable prices on beer and wine. Service is friendly when they're around. We did have to wave servers down a few times throughout the night. Come for happy hour of half-off wine bottles on Sunday."}
{"text":"Love this place great staff and food selection. The Pozole, wings, Nachos and meat and cheese boards are off the chain. Mix that with some Rum  and coke and your night is set. Sit inside or out and the vide is straight, nice little Phoenix gem that can handle customer traffic."}
{"text":"I've come here from brunch and I've also visited their other locations! Love the vibe, food, and especially the drinks! I had the takes two to mango with tequila...DEVINE! Service is always above and beyond!"}
{"text":"We used to LOVE coming here especially since it's an easy walk from our apartment. We'd come late nights and for the mimosa specials on weekends & the service would be AMAZING.  Unfortunately, for the past 6 months - we haven't had the best service, the food would be mediocre and it's just not as personable than we're used to.   Shout out to the people who used to make this place feel like a second home."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Great food, atmosphere, beer and service. Our server/ bartender Erika was great. Sat at a table with a buddy and my 1 year old son and she was awesome. Will be back soon! Thanks Vig!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great both inside and outside of the Vig. There is a great variety of food choices here. I would recommend the pozole as a side, the $3 up charge is well worth it. The black and Blue burger was great, however we took our order to go and 2 of the 3 burgers seemed to be thrown in the box. Otherwise great tasting and nice staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch today at The Vig, it was Amazing! Our food was delicious and our bartender, Shawn was amazing. He was great, we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Vig is still pretty cool.   I usually go to The Vig on 40th street but I was excited to hear that The Vig had opened much closer to my home.   I rode bikes there with my girlfriend a couple days ago. Our experience was pretty good. I would say the difference between this Vig and the 40th street location is the demographic. There is definitely a younger and more hip vibe at this location. The service is FAR better at this location as well.   Pros - great food - decent prices - great customer service - cool atmosphere and vibe  Cons - I didn't care for the hostess (acted like a square)"}
{"text":"The new Vig in downtown on Fillmore is a cute little restaurant. I really enjoy sitting outside on the patio. Everything on the happy hour menu is amazing and my favorite drink is now the Moreland Marg- it has habanero infused tequila in it and wow it is spicy, but good at the same time.  One of this day I will come back and try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for brunch everything was amazing!  Parking is a bit tricky, but worth it. Service, food, drinks all outstanding.  Great Sunday."}
{"text":"I was a first timer here and what can I say\"I loved it.\" The first time I was here, it was for my birthday which was a month ago. Why I chose to write a review right now is because I'm still pretty new to the yelp thing. And I feel that I should help those in need to find a great place for a great evening... The service here is great, they are always on their toes(refills, order, etc...). Very nice staff. The place gives off a very positive vibe. This place is great for dinner parties and social gatherings. The food is amazing, I had this one place that contains salmon, I can't remember the name, but I will post a picture. All I know is that I was very delicious. Our waiter was beyond amazing. He surprisingly asked us if we had room for dessert and we asked for a menus, and before we new it, he arrived with a large brownie dessert with ice cream on it for my birthday. Because of him, I believe I supported my thoughts about This place.  -positive vibe -great staff -food and dessert AMAZING I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Diverse crowd , strong drinks and amazing happy hour prices .. Tequila sunrise 3 rounds =$15 !!! Dope!   Nice space outside, great weather yesterday so took advantage of the patio. I heard Sundays are live with a DJ, I def want to go back then. My bartender was accommodating and always made sure I had a full drink! The place was clean and made me feel at home.. Will be back!   5 stars"}
{"text":"If you wanna try this place out, go to the one on camelback and 40th street.  The service there is amazing and the outside seating area is prettier.  We had a party of 8 and we're seated in tiny room with another party of 8 loud people!  We couldn't hear each other speak so we were having a yelling war.  Food here is meh, I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and for what I paid, I would've expected more than 3 pieces of shrimp.  My boyfriend had the Mac and Cheese and although it was saucy, it lacked cheesy flavor.  I think I would come back to this location one more time- but for what we paid, we'd expect better tasting meals.  Server was nice until we corrected her assumption that the check were to be split amongst couples.  She didn't even try to hide the fact that she was annoyed!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a killer atmosphere. Food wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. Bathroom wasn't clean. Would go back and give them another shot!"}
{"text":"Went for a late brunch. The bloody Mary bar was awesome! I had the Hangover Helper. I wish it was more carnitas and less tortilla but the flavor was great! My friend had the breakfast sandwich and said it was great. My boyfriend really enjoyed his burger. I'd definitely be down to come again."}
{"text":"One of my FaVoRiTe places...My husband and I catch happy hour and it has never disappointed us.  The food is delish - the prices can't be beat.  Service is always delightful.  I love me a happy hour that starts at 3:00 in the afternoon.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by my experience at The Vig Fillmore. It might have been that we were seated inside instead of on the awesome patio. It might have been that the menu is one of the worst I have seen (Pad Thai and Burgers? Mexican food and Edamame?). It might be their apparent love affair with American cheese, or as I call it, plastic. (Why not use cheddar?) Sorry to say it, but based on their current menu, I most likely will not return. I wish them all the best and hope they create a better menu."}
{"text":"This is THE WORST VIG to go for drinks. ESPECIALLY THE 4.00 Titos. ALL WATER. The red sangrias are never consistent. There is only 1 bartender there who knows how to make a good sangria, I believe her name is Brianna  It's VERY obviously water down. It's a cool hip vibe and the patio is awesome.   Drinks are terrible service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome and the food was delicious! The only issues are a lack of parking and some ill-mannered valet workers."}
{"text":"Met an old friend for lunch here. Lack of street parking makes it a bit hard to access but after circling the block, I found that the Vig has a small valet lot on their SW corner. Try that first.  Staff were very friendly, genuine, and helpful.  Service was well timed.   I ordered the fish tacos and they were very good. Would have been nice to have a few tortilla chips with it. I loved the tart green sauce on the side and would have used that as salsa, too! Friend had their pad Thai, which she LOVED.   This is a good, mid-priced place for lunch. In the cooler months, their outdoor bar is a great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"A lovely patio with yummy cocktails that just scream \"DAY DRINK WITH ME\"? Yes, please! Chips and guac and salsa appetizer to munch on while imbibing? Yes, please - and damn yummy salsa.  I enjoyed this place as Local Breeze - I had a nice brunch when it was Palette. The current incarnation, as the Vig, feels the most likely to succeed. At least I hope it does.  I've been to Vig Uptown many times, and the menu seems to be just as varied and good at this location - but more than anything...the patio is just plain fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped in over the holiday weekend to enjoy the Bloody Mary bar.  You make your own which is a cool idea and try them as often as I can.  The lay out had several different things you can add including freshly made bacon!!! I had the breakfast sandwich with potatoes, it was filling for sure egg was cooked perfect.  Husband had breakfast enchiladas which I was jealous over, I will go back just for those.  Service was just OK took a little time for the server to come over to just ask if we wanted water. That would be the one thing they could work on other than that I really like the whole vibe of the place.  Might actually like this one over the one off 16th street."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. I ordered food exactly 17 minutes before it arrives for brunch and it's dry. It's disorganized as a restaurant. When I tried to use Yelp 20% off coupon, waiter took my phone out of my hands without asking permission to show to manager. I had to chased him down. We asked to have bill separated. When bill showed up waiter still charged me a full amount on my bill. And charged full price on my friends. And act surprised? Food was bad and customer service is worse. And manager has not been helpful."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the happy hour is nothing to pass on, especially after a long day at work! The grilled fish tacos and sliders hit the spot!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS a good option for whatever ailes you. Try the HUGE bowl of Pesoli and sourdough. LIVELY crowd, plenty of BIG SCREENS, nice menu...outdoors of course."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and absolutely loved it! Wonderful eclectic entrees and environment... Loved the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Brought my sister and her fiance here for dinner on a Sunday night.  We got here just as the NFL watchers were heading home so alot of space was opening up.  Nice adaptive reuse of this property.  With the weather finally cooling down outside we decided to grab one of the picnic tables near the entrance.  Its shaded pretty well and you get a nice view of the whole courtyard area.  Like all Vigs there's a lawnball court out back.  There's also a nice outdoor bar right in the middle of the courtyard with TVs facing all four directions.  I didn't go inside to the lounge area, but it looked pretty cool from where we were.  The food is pretty standard Vig fare.  Some surprises, but mostly reliable Vig standbys.  For an appetizer we split the soy garlic edamame dish.  My sister and her fiance are health nuts so this played right into their wheelhouse.  For the main dish I got the Hot Chick which is basically a chicken sandwich with pesto and mozzerella.  Good, clean, flavor and got fries on the side.  My sister got the same thing and her fiance got a chicken salad.  The service we got was pretty adequate, though our server got a little disorganized with our orders.  They're fairly new so I know they're still working out the kinks.    Overall, the menu won't wow you.  But what they do have, they do right.  The atmosphere is really cool and will make for a great nighttime hangout now with the weather improving.  And if you're just coming for drinks after a dinner next door at Cibo, this place will do the trick.  Add yet another great addition to downtown's exploding culinary scene."}
{"text":"I come here way too often and I'm just now finally writing a review. I can't recommend the Vig enough especially this  one! The staff is always kind and efficient, and the food is always yummy!  The interior of this place looks great. The bar has a nice white, marble. The barstools kinda hurt your butt after awhile though... There are also a lot of indoor tables and booths, all of which are super comfy. Another thing I love about the interior is the exposed brick! This place is so cute, especially at night. Although, I should mention that some of the booths inside are poorly lit. I sat at a booth near the back once and had to squint the whole time as the overhead light was extremely dim and unadjustable.  If you're coming at night, I highly recommend sitting outside! They've got a ton of fairy lights and it's really pretty (and could be romantic!) if it's cool out, they've also got HUGE space heaters.  The only minor downside to this location is the parking. This isn't a problem if you come early, but if you tend to be late (cough cough, my friend Ahmed!) then you might be driving around in circles until you find a spot. There's a SMALL private lot you can valet. I believe the lot is shared with the neighbor restaurant Cibo. There's also lots of street parking available.  I'm a huge fan of the trifecta, calamari, classic burger, chicken wings and guac and chips. They've also got a HUGE drink menu!!  Definitely a great place for a first date (and second and third) and definitely a great place to catch up with an old friend. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First timer with my lady... Great atmosphere. It's loud but that's what makes the vibe.   The food was good! The nachos were bomb. Vanilla braised short ribs were delicious but a little too much of the juice from the meat kept them a little soggy. My lady had the turkey sandwich.   Service was excellent but the foods a little overpriced. I'd come back though!"}
{"text":"Love the Vig! Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Whether you're indoor or outdoor, The Vig will treat you right."}
{"text":"I have now been here post 11pm for the late night crowd, and around brunch. Both times have been thoroughly enjoyable with good service, drinks at a great value and quality bar food. Each time i have been, they were too crowded inside and my group didn't want to wait, so we sat outside. it does get a bit uncomfortably hot in the summer, but in the evenings and once it cools down, the outside patio is really nice. they have a great bar with TVs showing sports, and well cocktails are usually about $5. They have daily specials and a great happy hour menu. I really like their chicken tortilla soup and my fiance loved the burger. I would like to go for brunch next. It is located in a great location in downtown Phoenix and I look forward to see what else pops up in this hip little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Checking out other yelpers reviews from this area -- really wanted \"beef\" and decided on a burger from Vig.  We arrived around 8:45 on a Thursday and the wait was at least 30-45 minutes. We lucked out and scored some bar seats after about 5 minutes so thankfully I would not die of hunger tonight.  Everything seemed nice, we were opposite side of the cornhole game. The view of the city is cool through the bar area.  Anyways onto the food and drinks... we started off with a specialty cocktail. A mule and the drink next to it on menu. Sorry forgot to take pics of the menu but I'm sure another reviewer got it ;) the drinks were great. So no complaints there.  We started off with a Greek Salad, olives on the side... good salad and I liked the dressing Sweet potato fries -- super well done. I mean crispy. I don't want a mashed potato... first attempt blah... I mean we ordered the fries about 2 minutes AFTER the salad -- some how the fries showed up FIRST? Hmmm. I make these all the time. I ordered this way because I know how long it takes to make, plus the restaurant is busy and I didn't want to get everything out of order. Hmpf. So we ended up wasting a bunch of the sweet potato fries because they were inaccurately cooked. :-/  Note: All bartenders were extremely friendly. I didn't really think it was their fault because they had food runners.  Next I ordered a red cab off the bartenders suggestion. Yummy BUT extremely cold. Red wine that was as cold as my water!! So that was a weird surprise.  On to the Vig Burger & Brussels sprouts... because why not order the name sake? We ordered with no cheese, aioli sauce on the side - && medium. Pink all the way throughout the middle.  When the burger came -- immediately we noticed it had the aioli sauce on it. My bf HATES Mayo and it is mayo based (which we confirmed during ordering and why we asked for it to be on the side) -- so we tell the server and we have to order a new one because it's on the top AND bottom of the bun... the first burger which I ate because I hadn't ate all day and I don't mind a little mayo -- BUT my burger was WELL done. Not even medium well. I literally ate 3 bites of 1/2 the burger. But since we already had another one on the way, what could I say more?  The new burger looked perfect and awesome but I was no longer super hungry, especially not enough to make myself full (even if we are on to the good food. I had sadly filled up on the bad). The Brussels sprouts weren't too bad, but if you'd like a suggestion from someone who makes them as well -- cut off the thick steam of the sprout! It is sour and tough. Takes way longer to cook and gives the overall taste a muted affect.  Anyway, will I be back? Probably not for this price and with all the other food areas downtown, I'll keep searching so I don't have to waste food. (We legitimately had 2/4 dishes replaced and they were the main parts of the meal!!)  perhaps if we were approached for everything being wrong of given some sort of \"we effed up your dinner, let me buy your drinks\" but we were barely apologized to - just given the new, correct food."}
{"text":"We had the best waiter, Daniel, and they took a reservation for us on the patio (3 tables worth) granted it was midweek. Everything was smooth, food phenomenal (although the flatbread was a little crunchy), everything else was fresh and tasty. Parking isn't too bad..free down fourth Ave, meters along Fillmore or free valet between Cibo and The Vig. Thanks for helping our group have a great celebratory night!"}
{"text":"We've come to this location several times. I'm sad to say that I remembered to review it today due to the lack of service. Visit was on Friday March 16th, 2018.  Let me tell you friends, WE LOVE THE VIG FILLMORE!!!  Again, frequent customers. However, today Friday around 1230pm, we arrived for lunch and got seated right away. I was glad they were about 40% full. Every other time we've gone it's usually packed. Yet we always have great service, great food and great time.   The server was an elderly (compared to all the young kids) tiny lady. She did greet us and with a \"I'm going to smile through my teeth\" attitude. She could not care less. When she brought our waters we asked for lemons. Never came until we reminded her again a long while later. She took our drink order and that took forever as well. She finally brought them and came back humming every time. Literally humming some random tune as she arrived and waited for our response???  seriously???  Like she didn't care about what she was doing. Her time humming was more valuable. Took our order and didn't see her again. Someone else brought our food out. Reminder again:  the food and service has always been TOPS. Today we unfortunately got a server who didn't give or seemed like she knew why she was there. Our nachos and drinks were super yummy.   Server came back (humming to herself) as we were done. We asked for the check and she nodded as she hummed and walked away. Brought check humming, set it down   No \"thank you\" , no \"have a nice day\". Walked away. Now because our food was great and brought out by other helpers like hostess and helpers who actually had a personality and smile and greeted us and said please and thank you, I left my usual high tip. However, our server of Hispanic descend should not be serving people. No smiles. No personality.  Next time we are int hat area we will do a quick recon and see if she is there or what tables she is not helping, we will request those.  Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"Was downtown for court today , and after a great morning with my three attorneys , I wanted to buy them a good lunch . I've been to all the vigs but this one is super cool , looks like a house from the outside , very good atmosphere inside . Got the lobster roll  special , it was spectacular ."}
{"text":"What a beautiful patio, the service here was ok. We had the pozole which is a Huge serving a little spicy but delicious. The fried Calamari was delicious it came with a yummy dipping sauce and we ate every bite. I had the beet salad which was good nothing impressive. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore is one of my favorite spots, I like to go here for birthdays and holidays with my family and friends. They have an awesome outdoor patio area but it can get noisy out there. There is inside seating in a mostly glass room, lots of light and also seating in the bar area which is like eating in a little pub. Love their food, especially Sunday brunch, my favorite is \"hangover  helper\", which is like lasagne made with layered corn tortillas, pork carnitas, red sauce, cheese and onions, so delicicious. One of my favorites. They also have bottomless Mimosas for Sunday brunch for $15. Bring a designated driver or take the light rail and walk to 4th and Fillmore. parking can be an issue, you're probably going to have to walk from your car. but it's worth it! The service is always above average and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this location! Everybody here is super friendly! My favorite Sunday spot to go to for brunch!"}
{"text":"Loving this place!!! Drove here from Los Angeles,CA and we're staying a block and a half away. I checked out different locations near by that are open after midnight and this place popped up amongst many other. The staff is freaking awesome and suggested a bunch of friendly establishments to visit on our short trip. Both bartenders are cyclists which was badass because my husband and I brought our bikes on today's trip. The food is great, the drinks are delicious, the staff is the best. I can't wait to try the other locations they recommend too."}
{"text":"The Vig is my favorite restaurant in Downtown Phoenix! They have an awesome menu and a great drink selection as well. Whether it's a dinner date, meeting up friends, this spot caters to all.  The nachos are a great appetizer to get when you're with a group, be careful because you will get stuffed before a meal, it's a big portion. It's a great ambiance and if you can, choose the outside seating.  The staff here are all really cool and fun to talk too, everyone seems to be personable. When you're done with dinner, play some cornhole with friends and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  From the moment we (my husband & I) walked in until we said good bye, the service was outstanding.  The bar tenders were friendly and funny, our glasses were always full, and the food was quite scrumptious.  The Vig Filmore knows how to treat its guests."}
{"text":"Love this place! Me and my buddies literally come here most days of the week, no lie, because the service is second to none! Shout out to the whole staff- Jordy, jase, Tristan, mikayla, Candice, Alicia, Jenna, and everyone else! On top of that their food is amazing. Get the pad Thai chicken!"}
{"text":"The Vig is my favorite place ever! I was so bummed out when they told me they didn't have any gluten free buns. I have an allergy & I always look forward to coming here for a good meal. It makes me nervous to come back if they aren't always going to have the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food and some of their staff service. Minus 3 for crappy bottomless mimosas that had zero fizz to them. More like bottomless orange juice...."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and ate outside at the bar. I ordered a Greek salad and a wheat beer. Everything was wonderful. Really enjoyed being able to eat outside in March since I was visiting from the cold midwest. Lots of free curbside parking if you're willing to walk 1-2 blocks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and drinks! Saturday and Sunday brunch time gets packed but they don't accept reservations so chances are you will be waiting more than 2 hours to sit on the patio unless you get there right when they open  that's my only issue with this location. Other then that, food is good."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent patio area.  Always a treat to stop in after a long day.  Unfortunately we couldn't have dinner here this past week due to plumbing issues.  However, when in downtown Phoenix, it's a great place to unwind.  Will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this new location of the Vig...amazing indoor and outdoor space!  Friendly bartenders, great drink selection and amazing patio.  I came back again a few days later because I couldn't wait to sit out on the patio...we scored the best table next to the outdoor fireplace.  The hummus and edamame were huge portions, reasonably priced at happy hour and very tasty!  The specialty cocktails are amazing too...can't wait to come back again and try some more!"}
{"text":"I am a Vig brand super fan. Great food. Drinks. People. So this breaks my heart.   The white trash-ass smoking allowed on the patio ruins this place. It occurs to me they might allow smoking on at the Arcadia Vig, which allows explains why I live at Uptown.   Smoking is so fucking gross. It makes your food gross. It makes your drinks gross. It makes the experience gross. For example, the smokers next to me are talking about how they pee between each others legs when one is sitting on the toilet and one is standing and also about how when her boyfriend recently inserted a tampon in her vagina, he asked where their relationship could go from there. I hope they're happy.   Also, I've now been here approaching 20 mother fucking minutes and have yet to be approached by an employee. Embarrassing."}
{"text":"Cute place. Service sucked. Short rib tacos and tatter tots were amazing. Don't eat the fish tacos they taste like dirt."}
{"text":"This Vig is now in the running with my favorite Vig in Arcadia! On our way to Cibo to take my daughter for her favorite pizza in Phx, we pull in to valet and find here we are at this Vig. Mistake but we opt to check it out instead of Cibo. LOVE the spacious patio! We sat inside but that patio has potential for awesomeness! I love the salad with shrimp and prickly pear dressing in the summer... it's pure lightness and just enough. My daughter wanted the sliders and to try out the cheesy filled tater tots, which 3 of us split, as they are rich. Good! BUT rich! The staff is always spot on and I know this place will and already is amazing as all the Vig's are. Being able to valet in such a busy area of town is a plus. Can't wait to go back and check out the patio on a Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas are amazing! Had the chorizo burro- it was so good! Also if you have Wes as your server, he will do an awesome job! This man was very attentive and a great server!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband works downtown so we decided to meet here for an impromptu date night. First off, I love that downtown Phoenix is become a bit more urban and developed as far as the night life and culinary scene goes. We were there on a Thursday around 7ish and were told the wait for the patio was about 30 minutes. I liked that they took our cell phone # and would text us instead of carrying around a beeper from the 80's. We found a single seat around the crowded yet pleasant outdoor bar. The crowd was very diverse ranging from the plentiful down town ASU students to {on the younger more good looking} middle aged couples such as ourselves to a handful of good looking, distinguished business men.   My first impression however was to be completely and almost ridiculously ignored by a young {blonde} female bartender whom I can only assume was at the tail end of a very long, very bad day. She walked by us scowling several times  with a sideways glance and perceptibly spiteful, served three different groups of people who had arrived there after us. After about 15 minutes (it wasn't that busy) a very nice young man took our order. He took the time to ask me a few questions about my taste preferences in wine and quickly poured me a sample of chardonnay which I loved.  He poured a beer for my husband and even asked me to \"say when\" as he poured my wine.   We were seated at a small patio table under strung lights on a faux grass lawn. Our server, another very pleasant and well informed young man immediately greeted us and ran over the fairly unimpressive menu. He \"highly recommended the house made guacamole\" and so we ordered it. It was good, but nothing to write home about and extremely over salted, and I love salt.   I ordered the salmon which I am always apprehensive to do because most venues overcook it to death and my husband ordered some sort of burger. Our waiter was more than pleasant when I asked to substitute the also highly recommended soba noodles with seasonal grilled veggies.   Our order came out in a near fashionable time while we enjoyed quizzing each other with the Trivial Pursuit deck of cards that were set on the table. Our drinks were refilled in perfect timing. My salmon was cooked almost perfectly, no complaints except it was just a tad overcooked and lacking any flavor other than a hint of lemon and a bit too much oil. The grilled veggies, the same, good but too oily and no flavor. My husband said the burger was \"good\".   Over all, nice atmosphere, decent food at a decent price. Good place for happy hour if you don't get the cranky blonde bartender and might be more fun with a small group of friends if your not crunched for time. Will optimistically try this place again."}
{"text":"We came here during the day and I loved the atmosphere :) I was bummed it was a little too hot to try sitting outside, because the patio looked really fun. I've had better burgers, but there's a great beer selection and the calamari is amazing!   They also have really great deals on all different days of the week, definitely something to check out if you know you're going to go!"}
{"text":"Started with the big Vig bruschetta and then had the trifecta pretzel bun sliders fantastic! now out on the patio for some drinks and a birthday party great service,  great food, great atmosphere! Candice doing a great job! Then there is Ray on the patio, what a great guy!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the atmosphere was relaxed and nice. Services was good but a little edgy, which wasn't a bad thing."}
{"text":"went on sunday around 11am isn  with friends from seattle sat outside nice outdoor area my only complaint was music was to LOUD!!!! a little hard to have a conversation. service was delightful and friendly and all the dishes we ordered were tasty"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I am downtown and feeling hungry. I absolutely LOVE the Posole! I get it every time! The atmosphere is great and the servers are fun and on point. The Vig has never disappointed me. OH WAIT!! I ordered the Pad Thai and it was just to \"soupy\" for me and quite flavorless. Maybe (10 years in Olympia, WA surrounded by Thai restaurants) I am a bit snobby about my Pad Thai. The Vigs Pad Thai was just not what I am used to. But in the end, I love the patio vibe and staff and the fact that they do Doggy days on the patio!"}
{"text":"Really happy this has come to downtown phoenix. It's nice to have a place where you can bike ride to that has such a great atmosphere. It's also dangerous in that you sit down for lunch and next thing you know the sun is setting. It's just too hard to leave the patio. I've enjoyed everything I've had to eat. I also appreciate the events they are putting on."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant gets quite busy, I have decided to have my lunch at the bar so I would not need to wait. For my surprise I had an amazing experience. Delicious medium steak with sweet potatoes and an absolutely spot on gravy. The dessert I recommend is the cookie and cream that mix actual two big cookies with vanilla ice cream, with caramel, chocolate and strawberry sauce. It works out perfectly like an ice cream sandwich, with a big cookie under and another above the ice cream (refer to picture). They serve a popular brunch on Sundays from 10 AM. It seems to be a very busy and nice place for dinner as well and the bar gets quite packed according to the staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so looking forward to our usual orders, being that we haven't been here in a month. I order the Vig Dip and he orders the VigAz burger. To our surprise they have changed the menu. To my husband's disappointment they no longer have the VigAz burger on the menu. The server did a great job attempting to  make up for it by suggesting to add bacon & arugula. Too bad that they didn't add the arugula (just the ice berg) and they forgot the bacon. The server brought out a side of bacon, but needless to say it just wasn't the same. Oh and they took the Rulemule (Moscow mule) off too. :( I was relieved that they still had my vig dip! But *gasp* I didn't notice that they changed how it's made. Ugh. The pretzel bun is so much more tastier, now they have some type of a wheat roll, they took out the delicious havarti cheese for something else that only adds to the blandness of the meat. The Aujus is just as disappointing because it tasted like watered down soy sauce. Luckily the fries were left untouched but it doesn't make up for the meal.  We MAY come back just for drinks but our family dinners will most likely be elsewhere..our last memory this meal - we still spent $50 for a meal that we didn't really like. But that's what you do when you're Hangry, you just eat."}
{"text":"The BEST veggie burger I've ever had in the last 15 years of being vegetarian!   Ooh and the french fries come with this seasoning not unlike bbq potato chips, which ruled.  Staff was very friendly, love the neighborhood and the building."}
{"text":"Had a fun time here last Sunday celebrating a friend's birthday. The parking can be tricky and you might have to walk but I took no issue with this. The staff was great and very responsive. Had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how much I love this place!!! I've been there so many days in a row, I'm waiting for the staff to tell me to get a life. But I can't help it! The food is consistently amazing. The deconstructed fish tacos are out of this world-- fresh Mahi Mahi - and only $14. The pork nachos are simply heaven!  The hummus platter is awesome! And the wings are great!!!  And the happy hour food is some of the best selection and prices out there! Plus you can't beat $4 Titos through September!  To top it off, the service is OUTSTANDING!!!! Truly the best combination of great food and amazing service in an awesome location!"}
{"text":"Great patio ambiance...it has a cozy feel...very relaxing and just fun atmosphere... people were really friendly...outstanding food selections...the ahi tuna salad was amazing :)"}
{"text":"The Vig (any location) has yet to fail me. LOVE LOVE LOVE that their kitchen is open late, even on Mondays when most of our favorite spots downtown are closed. Their late night menu consists of all of their best dishes: nachos, the trifecta (sliders, FAVE), posole, chips & guac, big bowl (fries or onion rings, or mix!), street tacos and more. The thing we cannot go there without ordering: the VINGS (Vig's hot wings). Please do yourself a favor and order these. The back entrance that goes straight to the patio of ample tables, bar, fire place, and corn hole is a very inviting and chill atmosphere. Don't forget to use the trivia cards and play with whoever you're with and ditch your phone! Staff is awesome and service is always great. Love the Vig."}
{"text":"Fire food  fire environment. Great service. Perfect for a Sunday funday in downtown Phoenix. Much recommend !"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but they have recently changed their menu and I was disappointed with the new broccoli side dish.  I would like them to bring back the roasted cauliflower.  My sandwich was fine, but not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on a Monday night. Kitchen closed at 11pm, so it was one of the few spots downtown still open to grab a good dinner after 9:30pm.   Portion sizes are pretty big-- we ordered an app and 2 entrees, and had to take home lots of leftovers. Chicken nachos were delish! It was a ridiculous amount, we ate so much of it and should have saved room for the entrees. We also had the deconstructed fish tacos and the pad thai,  both of which were really tasty too.   We sat inside but the outdoor area look pretty big and cool. I am definitely coming back for the great brunch i keep hearing about!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a wonderful atmosphere. I went here for a business meeting, and the service was friendly and prompt, the drinks tasted great, and the food contained lots of varieties. Since we were a bigger group, we were in the patio. There was also a live singer, which was a pleasant addition to the experience. I would definitely come back here with my friends or family for a special occasion, and would recommend this place for businesses and big parties."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat or drink.  The sign said \"seat yourself\". We did.  After ten minutes at a high top next to the bar,  we left.  No server or bartender even looked in our direction.  Incredibly disappointed"}
{"text":"Just landed in Phoenix for a girls trip and needed a great brunch before our drive to Sedona.  This looked good n it was fairly close by.   I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and the ambience.  Didn't get a good look into the dining room bc we sat outside but the patio was just lovely.  Greenery with a full bar n couch/chair seating.  Prob a great place for drinks at night.  Handcrafted cocktails...say no more!  We ordered 4 diff cocktails and they were all good!!    Our host was also our server and she was great!!  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to help me out with vegan options.  I decided on the pad Thai but she came back n said they were out of rice noodles and would I like to substitute soba noodles.  Sure!  I love soba noodles but never had them served hot.   Their pad Thai is not your normal pad Thai.  But it was delicious.  The sauce is a thick peanut sauce almost like the sauce from a chicken sauté dipping sauce.   Great fresh veggies up top n chunks of peanuts.    My friends also enjoyed their Poke bowls and their Greek salad.    Wish we could have stayed longer to take advantage of the great outdoor patio but we had a long drive ahead."}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore is always a solid place to go for lunch.  The food is delicious, the service is great and the atmosphere is perfect.  I have been to all the Vigs and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 10/100  Parking: Plenty of street parking on either side of the restaurant, and they're all free after 8pm!   Ambiance: This place has outdoor and indoor seating, with an outdoor bar and TVs for those who are interested in some outdoor seating on a warmer night. I definitely think this place is more romantic at night, with all the string lights around the restaurant.   Food: I saw the pictures on Yelp and I couldn't resist ordering the Mac & Cheese with Short Ribs added. It was not a mistake! The short ribs were very tender and juicy, it went perfectly with the mac & cheese. I asked for it baked, which made the mac on top a bit crispier. It was awesome! We also got the steak and fries, which I thought wasn't as good as the short ribs mac & cheese. One of the friends in the group couldn't eat beef but wanted the bleu cheese burger, and was able to substitute the beef patty for a crispy chicken with no extra charge!  I was also able to bring in a cake to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday without having some absurd cake cutting fee, which I really appreciated.    Loved the food and ambiance here at the Vig Fillmore, and would definitely be coming back for another celebration!"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there today, and definitely will not be returning for the food. I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations. So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.  The outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.  We ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad.   One person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \"best turkey sandwich\" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite.   Nothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience, but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. A little pricey, but then again you get what you pay for. I had the salmon and it's refreshing to find a place that knows how to cook salmon medium rare and not dry it out. Parking isn't always easy, but it's worth the walk. Great place for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow.  No question I will be back.  The Pad Thai was HUGE, very fair priced, and delicious. (Actually one of the best meals I have ever had, plus I couldn't finish it, plus I am a big eater.  It motivated me to write a review.)  Wide variety of beer and spirits, but stayed with a local IPA.  Sat at the bar outside, fast service, people who care, and a very chill environment.  I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch or happy hour.  The edamame is a must try with the spicy garlic sauce.   The place is a little small and gets crowded fast, but is a fun atmosphere.  Have always had pretty good service here too."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the weekend and I couldn't have picked a spot for a late dinner. Beautiful courtyard patio and great food!"}
{"text":"Great service, water in glass was not a good taste since its from the tap. Lemonade wasn't as good as it could of been, the coke was funny tasting, probably all due to the tap water. The Salmon was very good! The veggies with the plate as well as the wine was all wonderful."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar, so I can finally make a Cesar (if you're from canada you know what I mean) except for clamato juice.  $4 Bloody Mary bar and $15 mimosas unlimited for the whole day! Awesome.  I went for brunch with a friend and it has a really cool atmosphere. Relaxed bar type, but I wore a dress and heels and didn't feel out of place.   I had the corned beef hash to eat. The best part about it was the sauce. The egg was undercooked in a few spots-gross. Other than that it was good but I'd say the drinks here far overtake the food in quality.   My friend ordered the encanto enchilada and loved it.  Will come again, probably just for drinks next time."}
{"text":"I was expecting a little more from this place. I had been to another location a few years ago and remembered them having some excellent nachos and a cool vibe. In Phoenix for a conference, the Fillmore location was a couple blocks from my hotel, and I was stoked for those 'chos!  I sat myself at the bar as there was no host or server present up front. The bartender was nice and it was pretty quiet. A few patrons at the bar smelled very heavily like smoke, which was slightly unpleasant. I ordered a Hoegaarden and my nachos. I was kinda disappointed they weren't as good as I remembered, and they also had black olives, which the menu didn't state. I detest black olives, but I wasn't gonna complain. Some people do have food allergies, so it is important to list all the ingredients on the menu. I worked in a restaurant so I pay attention to things like that.  It looked like they had a decent happy hour and some good brunch items. I would return if given the opportunity and try something else."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for \"Sunday Funday's\". All you can drink Mimosa's from 10 AM -2 PM for $15 bucks. The food is always good. I have had the Vigazz Bigger and the Trifecta Sliders and sweet potato fries. Yummy. Recently I tried the Pad Thai with shrimp and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Too hipster for me. We didn't even stay for dinner. I mentioned that we had a dog with us so we'd like a seat outside. The hostess first said it would be 30 to 40 minutes wait. We said that was fine then she said that dogs were not allowed even outside"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch for the second time. The vibe is chill, less posh-sterile than the Bethany & 16th location, which I like but just leans a little to the superficial for me. ANYWHO, i'm a fan."}
{"text":"So glad I can walk here. The outside patio is the bomb.com. Wish my backyard looked like that. This is a great spot for me to come and have a drink and enjoy the scene. Food is not as good as it is at other locations for some reason so I either have a liquid meal or stick w some apps.  Lots of bike racks out front which I love, no need to drive and search for parking. My only concern w my last visit is where does one wait when it's super crowded. All of the chairs and tables in the front are waaaay low to the ground. Not the friendliest or accommodating for people w physical disabilities. Not sure if there is even a ramp to go inside the restaurant. Lucky for you the patio is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Absolutely happy to give the Vig four stars on my first try.  Drive by and we were sold from seeing the side entrance.  Sat at the outside bar and ordered posole and nachos from the late night menu.  This was some of the best posole I have had in Phoenix.  The salsa and nachos were great as well.    We will be back and will bring friends."}
{"text":"We sat in the atrium, for a late night snack. The place is beautiful, service adequate, and the food was good. The atmosphere was the standout here, and I'd go back, just for that."}
{"text":"Great patio , great food beer and wine , sometimes live music , my favorite place for outdoors downtown ."}
{"text":"I got the blackened chicken BLT with a side of Mac and cheese. The sandwich was amazing. I wish I took a picture because it was perfection. Even the Mac and cheese was actually pretty good. I wasn't to impressed with the seating, it was very poorly lit, and very loud. The waitress was very friendly but took forever to get our order. The mason jar cake was okay. I also wasn't impressed with the chips and salsa (and the prices) but that sandwich made it all worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite regular spots. The Willow Wisp (their version of a key lime pie martini) is absolutely amazing! If you need something a little stronger ask Tony at the bar to whip you up a gummy bear shot. The Thai chili wings are a must!! I recently gave up meat so I'm sticking to the tater tots or nachos for now but that's ok since those options don't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Had chicken club and best turkey sandwich. Both were phenomenal. Great place to go before a show."}
{"text":"Has the feel of a relaxing lounge. However, The hostess and waiters get a little agitated if you sit down at an empty table even though the place is half empty. That part is Quite annoying but I would still go back just to do it again just for the heck of it. The place is laid back not the people not so much. Which is sad because I wanted to give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love the neighborhood! It has a good vibe inside & outside The Vig. My husband loves the Vigazz burger & onion rings. I had the Mac n cheese last time with chicken. It was delightful! The service is never super great. I think all the servers are more into themselves and one another."}
{"text":"Do not do brunch here- so many better options.  Impossible to get mimosas replenished when desired, the food choices are minimal (and we were not happy with both breakfast items we ordered), and service was nothing to brag about.   One person ordered the breakfast enchiladas and didn't eat them because of all the veggies under the eat that were not in the description (not a veggie lover). Someone else got the American breakfast which was \"mediocre and cold\". Another person got the Monte Cristo, which came soggy prior to putting any syrup or creme on it.   I wasn't drinking but my party was and had to ask three times for their mimosa refills. You pay for unlimited for a reason- you would just pay for three if you only wanted three.   Very underwhelming experience. We left hungry and irritated from the experience (and the flys that they can't take the blame for)."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Comfy and relaxing. Great service with attentive servers.  They put up with my friend's zillion questions about the food.   Happy hour was great and the specials were very tasty. Don't know how they cooked their chips but they were amazing!    Go!  You will love it!"}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with the customer service here.The Vig Fillmore was the first restaurant that I visited after moving to Phoenix about a month ago. I really enjoyed the food, so my boyfriend and I ordered takeout a few weeks ago. After picking it up and arriving home (a block away), I realized that they only gave me half an order. I returned and waited for the second half to be made. When I got home, I realized they messed up the order. We called the restaurant and Megan kindly gave us a gift card. She didn't try making excuses, just fixed the problem. I ordered takeout again tonight, and she recognized who I was. She made sure to check the order and hand it to me herself when I picked it up. This is a shining example of how customer service should be! Thank you Megan! You kept us as customers and now I'll happily recommend The Vig to others!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm obsessed with this place now. Wish we lived closer. Jenna is an amazing bartender/waitress. The entire staff was awesome and attentive like her!  Food was amazing! Great atmosphere and even live music! Great evening!!"}
{"text":"The big was awesome! It's located in an artsy District downtown and is on a little side street so you may miss the turn if you're not paying attention.  The parking is complementary valet so be sure to tip!  Location is really beautiful first thing you see is the outdoor seating with headlamps and a grassy area that looks like it's for games.  We ordered a chicken nachos appetizer for the table, which was really good and packed with flavor but it was one of those situations where once you eat the top layer with all the toppings there's nothing left underneath but at least they give you a side of delicious salsa to dip the extra chips in.  For my lunch entrée I chose to get the blackened fish tacos and let me tell you they were delicious. Pre-warning if you don't like spicy you should probably not get these because they have a slight kick. They came with a spicy slaw,  pico de gallo, and tomatillo-avocado salsa these fish tacos were perfect because all the condiments complement each other and they give you 4 so by the 3rd one I was already super full but you can't complain about getting more so I won't.  The best part is why you wait for your food come out they have trivial pursuit on the table for everyone to play and it includes three different versions like totally 80s, 90s, and I forget the other two because we were all too young to answer any of the questions but it was really funny we had a great time. I look forward to going back whenever I'm in Phoenix.   The four stars is only because we had to keep asking the waiter for extra everything and he would side eye us like we had plenty and didn't want to bring it. It wasn't a big deal more funny actually... But, not when you're hungry so."}
{"text":"Perfect for outside lounging and listening some live music. The food is great as well as the service. Definitely will recommend to everyone. This is my third time here and not my last."}
{"text":"Two of my friends recently got engaged and a group of us met up here to celebrate.  I must say I was thoroughly impressed by the customer service by our server!!!! (sorry forgot his name) :(.  It was almost scary how good he was at his job...LOLOLOLOL!!! Right when I was down to 1 spoonful left of my dessert he appeared (seemingly out of a secret floor hatch) to ask if he could take the plate away. Talk about customer service and attentiveness. Maaaaaannnnnn somebody earned their tip tonight!!!  I kind of don't want to visit the others Vig locations cuz I don't want anything to mess up the experience I had during tonight's visit.  For food all I ordered was dessert and a drink. The Moscow Mule made with Tito's went down real smooth. For dessert I had the mason jar mud pie. Usually, desserts tend to be overly sweet, but this was not. It had the perfect ratio of ice cream to chocolate cake to whipped cream and begs you to come back for more until the last spoonful passes your lips.  Even though I didn't order an entree I can say the sweet potato fry and stole from my friends plate was fantastic and whatever dip they serve with it needs to be bottled and sold separately. I also took a big whiff of my other friend's pozole (the red one) and it smelled amaaaaaazzzzing. Next time I will definitely order that soup!  All in all our group enjoyed ourselves and plan to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Vig with my wife and a couple friends while visiting Phoenix recently for their Brunch on Saturday, not entirely sure how to feel.   I guess I'll start with the positives: our server, Cory, was great. Very friendly, able to answer menu questions and provide good recommendations (the chicken enchiladas, her suggestion, were easily the best thing we ordered), prompt service start to finish.   Unfortunately, with the notable exception of the enchiladas, the food was basically bad diner qual. The ambiance was...bro crossed with drunk-old-white-women. The parking situation was a nightmare. But the lowlight was the Bloody Mary experience.   The Bloody Mary bar seemed awesome when we walked in, but when we got there to build ours, we found half the items were empty (plus, sweet bonus, the manager standing nearby twiddling his thumbs seemed to be deeply and morally offended when I asked about restocking some of the more crucial items...like Bloody Mary mix).   Overall, as a former server, I came away pleased, but that's because I'm pretentious about service and our server killed it. The rest of the group was disappointed, and I can't imagine any of them going back."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here for bunch on a Saturday afternoon. We sat on the patio and were pleasantly surprised how cozy it was. It felt like we were hanging out in our backyard. Misters, umbrellas, outdoor bar, and big shade trees. Our server was very helpful with menu recommendations. I ordered the Monte Cristo and hubs ordered the hangover helper. Both were delicious! Also $3 mimosas from 10am-2am, score! Dogs are allowed on the patio on Saturday's from 10am-4pm. We will definitively return."}
{"text":"My first time having brunch at the Vig today, and my first visit to the Fillmore location. Only three of us, so we sat at the bar instead of waiting for an inside table. I was ecstatic to see they had a vegan option, the Tofu Scramble breakfast burrito.  Top three breakfast burritos I've ever had.  The tofu was firm, well seasoned and paired great with the roasted veggies and guacamole.  I added black beans for a little extra something too. Since they had $4 bloody mary bar, I decided to try that out.  Their bloody mix is a little bitter for my tastes, but the selection of add-ins, sauces and pickles veggies is top notch.  Our bartender was working her fanny off with the $3 mimosa special, but managed to keep our drinks full and check in on us regularly.  This location opens at 11am, and they were pretty busy less than thirty minutes after opening. There's a small lot that is free, and the street is metered. My group also had breakfast enchiladas and the Monte Cristo, both of which got devoured.  I would def go back!"}
{"text":"I found this location to be outstanding. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, their outdoor patio. The food FN rocked both Twyla and I. The service was impeccable. Let me say, the grilled wedge salad rocked my world. Oh, and get the roasted Brussel Sprouts, FN delishious.  The music and vibe was awesome. Outdoor bar accommodates any other aspect you might desire. Highly recommended.  This will be a new regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food is good. However not having menu items available is unacceptable in my book. If it's not something consistently available it should be on a special temporary menu not the main menu."}
{"text":"This location of the Vig is my favorite the historic home is what makes the ambience! Our server was great and the short rib kimchi tacos rocked my socks off!    Can't go back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I ordered the Mac & cheese with bacon and luckily decided to stir the bacon in before starting to eat. As I stirred I uncovered a small, dead cockroach in my pasta. DEAD COCKROACH   I'm horrified by this and sad. The restaurant was really cute, the outside patio looked great and our waiter was awesome. With the exception of wildly unfriendly hostess, I could have really liked this place. We obviously decided not to stay so the manager comped our bill and gave us a gift certificate that would work for any of their locations but I cannot get over a bug in my food. Still feel sick just thinking about it today.   Obviously will not return."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with for the first time and had a very good time. The place has a cool set up and a nice bar area. I does sit back a little bit off of the street so it could be hard to find if it is your first time there.   The service was fast and that is always a plus. I had a couple of their pumpkin ale which was on tap and it was pretty good! I also had the Vig Prime Dip and I really enjoyed it. It was cooked well, and the fries were done well as well.  I did fell a little out of place since I am more of a country boy, who just happens to have tattoos, but I would go back if \"everything\" stayed the same."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and fun cocktails. The Bennett and bubbles was perfectly refreshing for a hot Arizona night. In terms of food, we tried the Brussels sprouts, braised beef tacos, and macaroni and cheese with chicken and broccoli (that selection was based previous reviews). I wasn't extremely impressed with the macaroni, maybe the reviews hyped it up too much. The tacos were great, slightly more on the spicy side. The brussel sprouts were good with good flavor, but could have been more crispy. Overall, I'd give the food a three, and the ambiance a four. Feel free to give it a try and make your own opinion, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing! I had a grilled chicken sandwich which was great. The staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We held an event on the Vig's patio and the team was spectacular. After planning this day for months, we arrived and it began to rain. Within minutes they had umbrellas across the whole area. Their team was flexible and attentive. Everyone afterward commented on the great venue and service.  I returned a few days later with a friend - once again, top-notch service. These guys are great at what they do. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food, great service!  I went for a Sunday brunch and had the tres leches french toast....so delightful!  The bacon that it came with was soooo salty and I like salt! lol  I also did the unlimited mimosas which were delicious were a little on the warm side.  Sat at the bar and the bartender was very sweet and she was attentive so you didn't have to wait long for refills!"}
{"text":"Living down in Fairview, the Downtown Vig has become our go to. Tired and just want wings? The Vig's outdoor bar. Dressed up with something to celebrate? The Vig's outdoor, candle-lit table. Taking out of town family to the Children's Museum and want a lunch we know everyone will love? The Vig's family-style outdoor tables. Every single time, we comment on the staff's professionalism and ability to make us feel at home and taken care of. Tonight, a small mishap with our dinner after 100 percent perfect meals every other time, and without missing a beat - the staff dealt with the issue with the same class they've exhibited at our celebration dinners, our lazy Tuesday dinners, and our \"hey, how about The Vig\" dinners. Here's to you Vig - and each and every one of you that makes your outdoor feel like our backyard."}
{"text":"This location has a great patio.  The food is the same as all the Vigs. It is hard to get away from the smoke though. If you sit at the bar, have Chris wait on you. He is actually attentive. Not so much for the female."}
{"text":"I typically go to the Vig on 16th street and it's a pretty cool place. I had tickets to see U2 this past Friday at US Airways Center and decided to take my date to the Vig Fillmore first for dinner since it's pretty close.   We arrived at 615 and headed to the outside tables since the weather was so nice. There were several reserved tables and only one communal table left available. We sat down and talked with another couple at the table that was just about to leave. A server came by and took our drink order.   After waiting about 10 minutes another server came over and said our table was reserved and we would have to get up. I pointed out that the tables that were reserved had neat little signs on them saying they were in fact reserved. Ours did not. She said that was their mistake and we'd have to get on the list which was an hour wait. I asked if she was really kicking us out of our seats after already ordering and having been there 15 minutes, and she said yup. I used some choice sarcasm, got up in a harrumph and went right next door to Cibo and had a great dinner. I never been treated like that in my entire life. Nuff said."}
{"text":"A nice ambience; however, customer service was horrible.  Was told it would be a 30 minute wait.  Waited 50 minutes at the bar so we each ordered a drink.  They never served me my drink.  On three occasions the bartender kept saying he hasn't forgotten, but would turn around and take others orders.  When we finally sat down, it took the waitress 15 minutes to serve us water.  We waited an additional 45 minutes until my friend asked another server to have someone take our order.  They served our food 30 minutes later.  After waiting for a total of 2.5 hours, I got a burger and water."}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore has a great Sunday brunch, $3 dollar mimosas, live DJ, nice patio (the inside is great too), and good food too. The regular staff is very friendly and interact with the regulars making it like a home away from home. The music is pretty good, but I wish there was more of a selection than early 90's R&B/Pop it gets old after a while. I would prefer a more ambient/electronic mix but it's close to home so I deal with it. It's still one of my go to places."}
{"text":"We came here for mimosas. Also brunch.  I arrived late and quickly threw in my order for an eggs benedict. Imagine my surprise when it came out with the rest of my table's food. The eggs were done perfectly, and the roasted potatoes were delightful.   Our waiter was understandably busy but we still received good service until we needed the check."}
{"text":"Nice staff! Helped me out with some Vegan options. Had a good Vegan burger, and the sweet potato fries was good!!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Phoenix, we frequented the (original) Vig, and always loved it. We have since moved out of town (NC) and were staying downtown Phoenix, and were so happy that there was a downtown location now! The food is exactly on par with the original (which is phenomenal and consistent - never had any bad food or drinks). We also HIGHLY recommend eating on the patio, as it is huge and roomy! We happened to go on a Sunday, and it is half price bottles of wine.. Service was AMAZING as always, too! Our server had us cracking up and paid attention to every little detail! We will definitely return, when we return to the valley!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent. Recommend by a colleague and just great evening on the patio.  Dat at the outdoor bar, drank good beer and excellent wine both which where very well priced. The house red is worth a try a Portuguese blend, delicious  The food was equally outstanding and they had a favorite on the menu, Pozolle .  I ordered the \"big bowl\" and it was just that , huge. ( you can get it as a side offering as well and very worth it )  It was worth the small wait as its prepared fresh and simply excellent. My dining companion as so impressed he took home what I couldn't finish  We enjoyed a nice evening outside, live music and fun people watching.  Great experience"}
{"text":"Looks like another successful entry to the Vig family.  The location is great (right next to Cibo downtown).  As in the other vigs, there is a bocce court.  With cooler temperatures you are fine on the patio.  I suspect eventually they will enclose the patio entirely.  The place is small with respect to inside dining, and the bar looks exactly like the one on uptown. Food is Vig food.  i.e. if you're a fan you'll like it.  Nothing offensive.  Have the cheddar filled tator tots with jalapeno cream, which was good but there was no kick.  Had a southwestern salad and a prime rib sandwich.  The shoestring fries are tasty (flavored with smoked paprika).  I liked the fact that the sandwich was served on pretzel bread.  they could probably serve shoe leather on pretzel bread and I'd like it.  The Southwestern salad was good and inoffensive. Overall, will be back. Not destination dining, but I'm not sure that's what they cared about.  It's just nice to have another downtown patio hangout.  The cocktails by the way look revamped and might end up giving sidebar a run for its money. I did not have any server issues and was fortunate that things were pretty smooth."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in Downtown Phoenix! They have specials on certain days of the week. I went on a Monday and they had $6 burgers however it's only certain burgers from the menu. I splurged out and went with the Vig burger and it was delicious! It had a sunny side up egg, jalapeño, and avocado on top of the regular toppings. Something unique also that I really liked was that you can choose posele for the side instead of fries, and trust me when i say their posele is a must try! I couldn't decide between their burger or posele so this made it a great option. i also had a root beer beer that went perfectly with my burger. They have nice outside seating area with a bar outside as well which was perfect for the weather we are having right now in Phoenix. I can't wait to be back :)   One more thing staff was super friendly from the hostess to the waitress"}
{"text":"Superb! The guacamole, the Vig burger, and the deconstructed fish tacos: yum! Brooks was the bartender and our waitstaff: so friendly, helpful and nice! Love the outside seating and the heaters. Charming!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience. We loved the ambiance and that it was a converted craftsman house. It was a bit warm while we were there so we didn't sit outside, but the patio looked like a lot of fun. We actually came to this restaurant because we were next door at Cibo one night and heard people laughing and having a great time at The Vig. I got nachos and my boyfriend got a burger. Both were tasty and the portions were generous. We shared the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream which was rich and delicious. Our only complaint was that service was slow. We waited quite a while to get our check."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Blues Traveler - Hook)  It doesn't matter what I Yelp So long as I sing with Bo Bites At The Vig Fillmore I'll review Some inner truth or vast reflection  But I've gave them 4 stars And I can keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter what I try If I'm doing my job then it's my reviews that make's it  Because the Vig brings you back I ain't tellin' you no lie The Vig brings you back On that you can rely  The Vig has done it again.  This time at \"the Fillmore\"    Located in the heart of Phoenix downtown, the Fillmore is perfect a for Sunday brunch or after a long work day Happy Hour.  I myself prefer being Happy during my Hours - Wink!    I came after a long work day with a friend and sat at what I call the backyard bar.  Nice breezy wind blowing through the bar area which sits in the middle so traffic flows well.  While the sunset upon the valley makes this place somewhat romantic!  HH specials on food and drinks; you can't pass this up!  I ordered their Grilled Fish Tacos along with a Stella Artois (Ever since that Adrian Brody Super Bowl commercial I've been drinking this like water -- darn you Super Bowl ads!)  Anyways, my fish tacos were amazingly tasty! Blackened whitefish with some pico de gallo and   spicy slaw gave this dish some kick and nice crunchy texture!  With a perfect setting and friends along with food and drinks; the Fillmore definitely got me hooked!    Overall, service was best at the bar area and ambiance makes any person feel lazy, and there's nothing wrong with that - wink! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I cannot get over the sweet potato fries and their paired curry aioli sauce. It's genius, addictive, and such a balanced pairing with the sweet potato and salty curry creaminess. But starting from the beginning..  The Vig is a picturesque little restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a weekend-only brunch menu, happy hour, and discounted burger Mondays after 6pm. The ambiance is casual but intimate, with nicely dimmed lights inside complete with table and booth seating. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait, but there's a cushioned seating area outside for lounging.  Classic burger with sweet potato fries: The classic burger here is impressive, and of course the sweet potato fries pairing is a must. The burger is comprised of a juicy patty, lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickled on a toasty bun. Sides include fries, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese or roasted brussels sprouts for an extra charge. I always get my burger medium rare, and it's always been cooked well and well-seasoned.  Guacamole and chips: The guacamole was freshly made, and I really liked the chunks of fresh avocado and fragrant lime. I almost felt like there was a tad too much lime because of how acidic the guacamole was, but this is just personal preference since my friends loved the acidity and wanted even more. I wasn't s fan of the chips; they were unevenly made with some being super thin and others being really thick.   Sliders: Though supposedly just smaller versions of the burger, I heavily prefer the regular burger to these sliders. I felt that there was too much bread for the small amount of patty, and the buns were dense and a little hard. There wasn't very much filling, so I felt like I was chewing bread and cheese most of the time. That being said, the happy hour price for three sliders and a huge mound of fries is pretty generous.  Blackened fish tacos: The fish was cooked well in these tacos, and there was a tangy slaw on the bottom that was a nice textural contrast to the fish and soft tortilla. The green sauce (jalapeño guacamole perhaps?) had a really strong kick, so it's a good choice for those who like some spice in their tacos. I did find the tortillas a bit undercooked and soggy, especially with the two stacked together, but overall these were also a nice item included in the happy hour menu.  I haven't tried too many drinks here, but I did like the Hoegaarden beer. It's one of the lightest yet more flavorful beers I've had, and it went down super smooth and was a nice pairing with both the burger and the fish tacos.   I think the overall food here would probably be a 3.5star, but coupled with the happy hour, ambiance, and those sweet potato fries, I'll definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"The Vig Filmore is a good place to meet up with friends and have a bite to eat, especially on Monday evenings when they offer their famous $5 burger and fries. The burger is as good as I remember it being and the sweet potato fries coupled with their special curry sauce is a winner. The staff is nice too. And last but not least, the patio is perfect for a casual/romantic night out and offers a safe area for the kids to play."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with coworkers. Always satisfied with the drinks and food. Service is a hit or miss. I love the ambiance, patio and most of all their nachos! One of the best nachos I've had in downtown Phoenix. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Not reviewing the food as I didn't get to try it***  Customer service gets a 0!  After waiting exactly 8 mins to be seated I decided to approach a waiter and asked if we could just sit wherever or we had to wait to be seated he responded with \"the hostess left but I will get one of the girls to sit you please wait\" mind you the place is about 60% empty with enough staff! I waited another 5 mins and nothing so decided to leawalk to my car and drove off."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with friends and had good experience, but nothing that would blow your mind. I have been to this location a few times and have always had similar experiences. The setting is nice and have always enjoyed the seating options (outside in shade covered seating or inside with a darker, comfort feel). The staff have always been fine and provided good customer service. They come by as needed but seems like it is only because they have to.  As for the food, I have never had a dish I did not like but also never anything that made me super excited to come back. Are you reading a pattern here? Today, I tried to the prime vig dip. It really did look amazing, but just did not have that wow factor. Every meal I have had has been carried by the tasty fries. Overall, a decent stop for downtown Phoenix, but not a place I think about when planning for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that this place opened up since it's so close to where I work. I now have another place I can stop in for a drink on my way home.  I popped in today for their soft opening for a hangover lunch. Their menu is pretty much the same as the other two Vigs so you can count on decent but not remarkable food. I've always gone to The Vig for the atmosphere over the food anyway so my expectations were met.  Today I have The Trifecta which is three sliders with fries. I washed this down with a Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale-totally hit the spot but I'm not and never will be a fan of pretzel buns. Although this is an appetizer it is very filling.  They've done a great job with the space. The bar and dining area are smaller than the other two locations but there is a second, atrium-like dinning room. The Patio is the true jewel of this location with a really nice outdoor bar and ample seating. It's going to be GREAT when winter comes.  What I was most impressed with was the service. Even though they've not officially opened everyone seems to have it together. One reason I don't go to The Vig Uptown is the attitude of some of the servers. Most of the servers here were very friendly and enthusiastic. My bartender Ashley was friendly  and, knowing that I was hurting, made sure that my water glass was full.  So I don't know that I'll come in when I'm hungry but I look forward to coming in when I'm thirsty. Like I said, I can't wait to hang on the patio when it cools off."}
{"text":"Whether you're at the original, Fillmore, or Uptown, you are at an awesome spot.  Great service, great menu with plenty of 'pig out' and healthy options, great variety of beers on tap and excellent speciality cocktails.   The Vig in Arcadia being a local favorite of mine when I visit Phoenix (every few months), I decided to give the Fillmore location a try on a Monday night.  Me and a buddy of mine came in, went and took a seat at the bar and were greeted right away with menus and a rundown of the specials and drinks to checkout. Graham, the general manager, came by as well and gave us his take on the menu.  We decided to take his recommendations and order the hot chick sandwich, mac n cheese, fish tacos......actually it was about 1/4 of the menu lol.  We went for the mac n cheese and deconstructed fish tacos.  I understand his delimma of narrowing down the menu to only a few things because everything I've ever had at the Vig restaurants has been excellent!    If you are in the area or have already checked out the other Vig locations and loved them as much as I do, then you have to come check out Fillmore. Great food, great service, great times."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The vibe is fantastic and everyone should try this place out. I went for brunch with a couple of friends and it was a blast. They had a make your own Bloody Mary bar, don't mind if I do, along with excellent brunch choices. Super cute place. Would love to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"My sister and I love coming here for happy hour wines and happy hour food! We love sitting in the smoking area and catching up. The service is always exceptional. We love seeing Grant when he's working. He always greets us with a smile!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here before a concert at The Van Buren.  The Vig is always solid regardless of what location you visit.  I had the bleu burger with fries and it was perfect.  They have a nice craft beer selection and the service was fast and friendly.  It's a short walk from here to the concert venue which makes it a great choice for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"been here countless times, we love the happy hour menu, we won't come at any other time due to the steep price for a meal. their drinks & food are great. we have gotten lucky with a couple wonderful servers but other than that the customer service hasn't been the greatest, they have forgotten many requests in the past.. I can almost count on that whenever I go in but other than that we enjoy the vig."}
{"text":"Spot ON today for brunch, and what a lovely morning to brunch on the patio?  Was my first time at THIS Vig, and I can say without reservation that the consistency of the Vig establishments is incredibly strong.  Tasty breakfast enchiladas AND nice Tito's Bloody Mary, gotta work this place in again.  Patio season is upon us again, at last!  Cheers Vig, keep it up :)"}
{"text":"Chad!!! You are the bomb.com!  Thank you for making sure our mimosas were never ever empty and according to my friend Adrian you were excellent eye candy to boot. We will be back to see you. (Love Adrian). Seriously though, Chad was awesome and our crew of four couldn't thank you enough for the service. The food was also pretty good as Chad recommended that I have the skirt steak with eggs for breakfast which was delicious but the potatoes were just ok. My poor friend Adrian stated that his potatoes were cold while everything else was warm. Weird right? The eggs they ordered weren't exactly scrambled but more of a mini omelet but it was still good (according to them). But the mimosas and the service alone were enough to warrant a 4 star review in our books. We will definitely be back for brunch again soon!"}
{"text":"I visited Vig Fillmore on a Tuesday evening for dinner. It was a relatively easy walk from downtown hotels. The restaurant had a very nice and functional layout with ample seating both indoors and outdoors. I ordered fish tacos with a side of Brussel sprouts. Both were delicious. There were 4 fish tacos (small, but plenty of food) and the Brussel sprouts were great.  The young lady who served me was courteous and attentive to keeping my drink refilled. The food was ready very quickly, and it was clear that the folks in the kitchen paid attention to details in the preparation. The ambience was very nice overall."}
{"text":"Cool spot in central phoenix.  I have only had lunch here, but dinner may be good also.  Nice outdoor seating area and bar.  Free valet."}
{"text":"I came in with a party of 12 on a very slow Tuesday. I will echo the other reviews in saying the aesthetic is wonderful- gorgeous patio and bar area, views of downtown and twinkle lights.   Unfortunately our service was sub par. I don't want to completely call out our server on here but her name started with \"R\". Our group was mellow- a few alcoholic drinks, and not everyone ordered food. After ordering the drinks she told us when she came back we would \"talk food\". The drinks took 15+ minutes, and when she came back she didn't stop long enough to take anyone's order. We waited another 10 minutes to order, while she walked around and helped the neighboring tables. Finally she took orders and the food took a decent amount of time. Truthfully it was just disappointing- there was no reason a couple Sangrias( red and white were delicious) and a beer should take that long. Also I don't know why she continued to not make taking 12 peoples orders a priority.   The food was good, we had roasted Brussel sprouts which I felt were a little undercooked. I had the flat bread which wasn't stellar, however the people around us loved their burgers, and the pork belly and watermelon.  After all was said and done our server charged us an auto grat fee which explained why she didn't feel the need to make us a priority.   Kind of had high expectations for this place and it was a bummer to have a lame experience- I think i will make another appearance some other time with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Excellent service and tasty food. I had never been here before and what a fantastic venue. I ordered a steak salad and took one of my dining partner's hot wings. I've never had such a good steak salad! Very pleased with my food. And, again, service was great. Not much parking around, but complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Some fun cocktails including a cold brew old fashioned.  Food is above average bar type stuff.    There was a hair in my friends burger which was a bit awful but the management was friendly enough and comp'd her burger.  She went to the restroom to clean her hands and there wasn't any soap.  She mentioned it to one of the staff and got shrugged off.  My food didn't have a hair and the men's had soap.  Winning!"}
{"text":"Pozole pozole pozole pozole. Pozole pozole pozole. POZOLE!  I say that as a person who loves to eat vegetarian, but the pozole is messed up it's so good. I'll be honest, I've not explored much beyond the pozole on the menu because economically it's hard to justify. This massive bowl of pozole is such a cost-effective deal, full of broth, pork, veggies and goodness, it seems like a waste of money to spend even the same amount on a sandwich, let alone more. I'm sure they're fine, but you get my point.  The fries are okay. Just okay.   A foodie's tour of Phoenix wouldn't be complete without a bowl of the pozole, and neither would an architect's. The Vig Fillmore is housed in a historic building in downtown Phoenix with a massive patio that actually economizes on its space with room for both seating and play. Speaking of play, there are trivial pursuit cards at all the tables, which can be nice on a busy morning when the service staff is taking a while (This is not a complaint. The place just get's busy because, you know, it's got good food.)  The wine menu here is VERY good, with a selection that rivals some of Phoenix's actual wine bars while also trafficking in better food and lower prices. Their specialty cocktails are also inventive and tasty and the beer selection robust.  tl;dr This place doesn't advertise itself as the place to be, but it really kind of is. It's got a great vibe for hanging out and plenty of reasons to stay a while."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because the waiter was nice and it seemed to have a good atmosphere. However it was a bad experience overall as my friend is visually impaired and the hostess told us that we couldn't sit inside because she had a dog, even after we explained that it was a service dog for the blind. We told her she was wrong so she deliberately sat us in a corner table that was next to the back door with flies coming in and swarming around us. It was obvious she wanted to seat us as close to the outside as possible.   The girl was young so she prob just didn't get it and wasn't educated on this matter, but when we brought it to the managers attention she was apologetic but said there prob weren't any booths available. I felt like she could have done more. My friend handles her disability very well and never expect better treatment than anyone else. She just expects to be treated the same, as she should since it's the law. The entire situation sort of ruined what could have been a nice dining experience.  As for the food: we both got eggs Benedict for brunch. The presentation was nice and it tasted fresh but was lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious food, refreshing cocktails & amazing atmosphere. By far one of the best patios around especially with this cooler weather.."}
{"text":"Great ambience & friendly staff. I would avoid the Fillmore burger, it has a special sauce and aioli, but it was still dry especially with a large bun. Onion rings were a greasy frozen variety."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many of nights out on the Vig patio. This is probably my favorite part of the restaurant, I have sat inside once. I am veg so I stick with the black-bean burger. I used to get the Pad thai and it was pretty darn good. It is my husbands go to every time. Food all and all has been okay but I definitely dont need to eat if going there. So many other fun culinary options in the area."}
{"text":"Love the outdoors area. The food is great and the drinks better. I ubered (yeah, that's a verb, stop the auto correct!) there because parking is not the best, but everything else is."}
{"text":"Nice patio, decent food. Met a few friends here for drinks and dinner. I ordered campari and soda which is a tough one to screw up. The salad with shrimp, cotija, and a citrus dressing on the side was also good. The air was a bit cool for my Arizona blood, so the waiter kindly brought us over a heat lamp.   Overall- not a place for super foodies or cocktail geeks, but a nice place to hang with a group when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I have endured endless requests to prebooze (Crescent Ballroom is a short stumble away) and/or dine here by friends. From this day forward, I will refuse to. If possible, I will navigate their thirst or hunger in direction of any other surrounding restaurants.   Vig is the new kid in town. It's (blandly) remodeled but wants you to think it's hip and those heavy-prices across the menu are therefor worth it!   They are not. The food is mediocre and certainly not worth the cost. Signature drinks are weak. And that service has a standstill at below average across multiple visits.   Pull it together, Vig!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other locations and this one is by far my favorite..it's in a converted craftsman house so it has the feel of having dinner at a friend's place.  Huge patio..food is always excellent.  I've tried a lot of there apps..on this nite I had the pad thai..normally I'm leary of having a traditional ethnic dish anywhere mainstream but their's was really good! It had a smokey flavor to it.  I don't normally eat leftovers but this one made for a great lunch the next day.  I have a feeling this place will get crowded as soon as people know there's a downtown location!"}
{"text":"About twice a week I drive by this place after school. I've been curious about the place for a while now. It almost seems hidden, quaint and surrounded with twinkle lights and tress that just set a very relaxed mood. I was pretty excited when my girlfriend suggested the place for a double date. We arrived and instead of having to wait a half hour it only took about 15! The inside of this place was alive on a Saturday afternoon and the bar was just lovely. It was just like having dinner at a friends back yard.   Ok food, my friends ordered pad Thai and t smelled sooo good! They lived it! The Vig ass burger was well cooked and juicey as for my meal, well I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. To start with it wasn't very flavorful. Upon further inspection, my chicken was partially raw.... Seems like the worst right? Let me tell you, once I mentioned it to the staff, I was offered another salad to replace the other-much more delicious when cooked btw- and the manager comped it. Seem good so far? WELL not only did they redeem themselves but my belly was so happy and full after the manager also comped dessert! My friends and I enjoyed the chocolate walnut brownie so much. The food was good and the management even better! Thanks guys! We will definitely be coming back and bringing more friends along!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for Smunch, my first trip to this outpost of the Vig.  Early on a Saturday parking was not an issue.  The patio with the outside bar was really nice on an early fall day.  The house itself just celebrated it's 100th birthday.  As usual the food at the Vig did not disappoint.  I had corned beef hash that lived atop a potato pancake.  The chunks of corned beef were tossed with peppers and onions that had a taste reminiscent of Ro-Tel, but not quite.  The two perfectly poached eggs were covered in a chipotle hollandaise sauce. Easily one of the best renditions of a corned beef hash I have had. The other six in our party were just as pleased with their food.  Service was great and the chef even spent a few moments at our table talking about some of the modifications we could ask for that were not noted on the menu, like he tries to keep a fresh can of bacon grease on the grill for those folks that want their food cooked in it.  He mentioned that after he overheard me talking about searing a medium rare filet in bacon grease in cast iron."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere and vibe was awesome. I loved the little courtyard area. We only came for drinks, so I can't comment on the food. The beer menu was pretty weak. They didn't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor."}
{"text":"1 star review, eh? Was it really that bad? Unfortunately for us, it was. Also, this is my first ever 1 star review... I'm usually very nice.  Heard good things about this place, their food, cool place downtown blah blah blah. But can only judge from my experience which was appauling.  We checked online to see they were open till 2am. It was 9 o clock and we were absolutely starving from filming in the desert all day. The band I had been shooting were from out of town and we're excited to experience what Phoenix had to offer.   We were greeted by no one and sat ourselves down. Our server took about 20 minutes so as it was cold I stopped an employee and asked if we could sit in the indoor area. The guy didn't say much other than 'sometimes it's private' went to check for me to never return.  Eventually our server arrived and told us that they were stopping food in 10 minutes and shutting the whole place in 20 minutes. Despite their listed times online and despite the fact their was still quite a lot of people still dining and drinking.  Obviously disappointed we decided to go with a drink before taking off for some food. The server recommended a beer for us only to return after a while to say they don't have it. Then again recommending another beer to then return saying they don't have that either. There was a group of about 10 of us and everyone was frustrated as we were struggling to actually pin down the server due to not knowing stock. So me and a friend went to the bar just to grab a drink and chat about some business whilst everyone else was trying to get served. To my disbelief the barman refused to serve me as we had sat down outside even though noone had been served yet for sometime. After pissing us off he reluctantly said he would by which time we were done with the place.  Absolutely terrible organisation and service. The staff here couldn't tell their arse from their elbow. Me and my friends will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Only reason they don't get five is because I had to wait too long to get initial service. We went late they are opened till two AM. They have an excellent late night menu! The ambiance outside is greatness! They played great music and the food was excellent. I had the nachos and my wife had the trio sliders! This place had great service once we got service! But the food was correct and if you bring in a ticket stub they take 20 percent off your bill. Safe to say the food was so good we forgot to turn in the ticket stub. The nachos were great, fresh guacamole and sour cream. The chicken was tender and moist the sliders were great with the pretzel buns next time you are downtown please go there!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good food and drink. Service however...SLOW. I think it is just the nature of this location. Everyone is just hanging our having some wine, enjoying the great weather and patio."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix to chill out,enjoy great food and a glass of wine. Seating outdoors and typically live music in the evening."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, fun atmosphere.   This place has quite a few options for veggie and meat eaters alike.   I have been here during happy hour about four times in the last four months.  Most of the food I've ordered has been great.  The edamame is as usual - salty and basic.  The chips and guac are excellent!  The flatbreads are just meh - no flavor / boring!  The mac and cheese is creamy and delicious!   I tried the fish tacos - they come with a lot of tacos!  There were four tacos that included fish, slaw, and some dipping sauce. Each taco was double wrapped.  It was very filling.   The sangrias are in pink, white, and red. All three are super tasty.    Service: Excellent, quick and friendly!    Parking: street parking and valet.   One time, and organization in which I'm involved had an event here. It was Ok but kind of a pain, since more people we were expecting showed up. I think the Vig was annoyed with us but tried to accommodate.    Sometimes Localdines.com has deals here - go for it!"}
{"text":"Having only been to this specific location twice I can tell you that every time never disappointed me in the slightest.  This past time we had gone around between breakfast and lunch in which I was never really aware that breakfast was an option at The Vig since we normally come past dinner time or after hours I should say.  So being a person that is absolutely in LOVE with breakfast/Brunch my mind automatically said we are definitely getting breakfast!  I ordered the Corn beef hash with poached eggs, I was not expecting it to look the way it did but OMG was it the best thing next to steak and eggs? Pretty damn close! My mom had ordered the deconstructed fish tacos and was loving that because she ate it like a salad in a way and was completely satisfied which is a plus since shes just as picky as I can be.  My brother ordered the BBQ Hot Vings and also liked those I tried one and wanted another but stopped myself from asking since thats all he had ordered.  If i were to choose between arcadias location and this one this one is winning."}
{"text":"Tried out The Vig today for an early lunch. The hostess was friendly and sat us in the beautiful indoor/outdoor part of the restaurant. The patio was tempting but it was just too hot to sit outside. I ordered the hot chick sandwich with onion rings ($12) and my friend ordered the best turkey sandwich with fries ($13).  They had a cute pepper tin full of trivia cards sitting on the table that you could play while you waited for your food, but we didn't have to play for very long. Our meals came out quickly and everything tasted great. The hot chick had just the right amount of spice in it. I also really enjoyed my friends turkey sandwich, but the coleslaw and dijonnaise made it a bit too rich for anything I would order for myself. The onion rings were also good but I'll definitely be ordering the french fries next time. They were super thin and crispy.    Overall I'm glad I checked this place out, I will be returning to try the Monday Burger Special ($5 for the Haverhood Burger from 6-10pm, normally $11)"}
{"text":"Came at 9pm on a random Tuesday.  The front entrance was closed which made it a maze to find the hostess stand.  The hostess informed us that they were finishing up and we could sit wherever.  I asked what time they stopped serving and she said midnight.  It seemed this was not for another 3 hours.....odd.  But she gave us the menus and told us to seat ourselves.  Thanks for that helpful interaction.  We ordered the ahi tuna salad.  The tuna was average and a little overdone.  The dressing was way too spicy.  It overpowered everything and made it difficult to taste the veggies.  Would have been nice if they add some cranberries or something sweet.  Also had the broccoli appetizer which was OK.  The brussels sprouts were Ok.  Neither was outstanding.    This one gets the big MEH."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner before seeing Dave Chappelle this past Saturday evening. I'm always a sucker to try what appears to be a good chicken sandwich so of course I did. It was very good I'm glad I gave it a shot. My wife had the pad Thai which she enjoyed as well. She had a mixed drink as well( I forgot the name) that was just delicious. We loved the atmosphere here, very quiet and relaxed feel."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and amazing drinks! We had outstanding service and this is definitely one of the best spots in Phx. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wish we could rate by category but bottom line is we WILL go to The Vig Filmore again...very nice experience.  - Service 5 stars - Atmosphere 5 stars - Drinks sounded cool but weren't that tasty 3 stars - Food was OK....not bad but nothing special... wouldn't eat there next time except dessert 3 stars...Had the guac, beef flat bread, salmon app, pork tacos. Maybe should have gotten posole instead?  But love love love the atmosphere of the old home in a garden with cool outdoor bar!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a classic modern atmosphere. The staff is friendly and attentive. Our waiter was Al and he was great with our ordering. My friend had specifics on her nachos and he got it right. We went during happy hour and their food specials are delicious. I had the sliders with pretzel buns and they were amazing. The buns were super soft and not hard n chewy. My friend had nachos and they were good. I totally recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I had the Vigazz burger and fries and it was DELISH!! For my drink I had the cornado and it was sweet enough with just enough alcohol for me.My friends had the grilled salmon and fish tacos and they both loved their meals. The tacos weren't enough to fill up my friend so she ended up ordering the Mac & cheese with chicken as well. It's a huge bowl of pasta so we had to help her eat it but it was pretty tasty. Not the best Mac & cheese I've had but good enough. Next time I may try it with bacon instead of chicken. Overall this is a chill spot with a good shaded outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"The location is a little strange but looks nice from the outside . We liked the atmosphere and ambiance of the place. They sat us at a table inside near the bar, one of the server (asian look) was extremely mean and rude to us, her manner and demeanor were not acceptable for an upscale restaurant like this. She kept coming back to our table and being noisy about our drinks because we had one person without an ID. She acted like we were second class citizens and didn't know the rules. She kept coming back with the same question: \"that 21 yo is not touching your drinks right?\" Etc...very annoying and uncomfortable to the point we had to leave and cancel our orders..."}
{"text":"Music is way to loud, and kept going after we were told it would wrap up in a few minutes. If I have to yell at the person sitting next to me at a 4 top, you know it's too loud for brunch. Turkey sandwich on brioche was good, wedge salad with romaine was good,  no iceberg yeah."}
{"text":"I love what The Vig has done with the place.  I've been coming to this location back when it was Palette, then The Local Breeze and now finally something with staying power!  The outdoor bar area is my favorite feature.  I love meeting girlfriends here for drinks and hanging out with my boyfriend enjoying some brews.    The food, of course, is excellent.  I've had the Pad Thai, their veggie burger, and the macaroni and cheese.  The Mac & cheese is my favorite but I'm from Wisconsin so anything with cheese is my favorite.   My only complaint is that the lighting in the ladies room is awful.  It's artful and decorative but some how the light doesn't illuminate your face when you lean toward the mirror.  How am I supposed to get my lip gloss on straight without proper lighting? Not wear lip gloss you say? That is nonnegotiable my friend."}
{"text":"Came across this place on a whim. The service was great the food was even better. The mac and cheese is the best ever ... highly recommend ... it was too hot to sit outside but would be great place to sit out in the fall... Ricki Lee was our server she is awesome be sure to ask for her when you go"}
{"text":"Their waitstaff is very friendly and the food is delicious! You can't beat the Vig's Monday $6 burger special, it's a great meal at an amazing price!"}
{"text":"A near-perfect patio with adirondack chairs, corn hole and really good live music. My favorite beer on draft. The steak dinner I had there was fine. Not the best I've ever had but certainly very tasty.  It's a very fun place to meet friends at the end of the day and everyone seems to know it. So you'll probably have a bit of wait for a table. That's all right. Just order a drink from the outdoor bar and either watch a game on one of the bar's TVs or just people watch."}
{"text":"Definitely a safe spot to choose that will not disappoint. During weekends the patio does fill up especially with the cooling weather, but nevertheless seats become available. There are TV's at the outside bar, which is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH YES! Build your own Bloody Mary and $3 mimosas + AMAZING food. The breakfast sandwich was particularly incredible and I also highly recommend the Monte Cristo (a breakfast sandwich with French toast and the best special sauce I never would have guessed would be great). You have to try this place. Great atmosphere. You can easily dress casually or dress up for a party. The service here is great. I cannot recommend it enough!!"}
{"text":"Place had a great environment! Went right before dinner time before a baseball game and sat in the patio section outside. My sister had the short rib tacos that was a bit messy but had great flavor, I had the Chicken BLT and sweet potato fries which also had great flavor. Server was really good, as was the bartender. Definitely would come back again when in town."}
{"text":"Six of us came to this Vig's location for happy hour, and it turned out to be a decent lounge for group gatherings. The premise was aesthetically pleasing. From the inside out, the three dining areas started from the indoor bar, an enclosed dining space, and then the spacious outdoor patio. People can come for happy hour from 3-6pm, Monday through Friday. TVs were available by the bars, as well as lives music performances later in the evening. The loungy atmosphere was relaxing, casual, and fun.   The Guac & Chips ($5) came with a basket of warm chips that came with refills, fresh guacamole, and pico de gallo. The consistency of the guacamole was thick, creamy, with solid textures. It could use some chopped jalapeno, but otherwise it was a good value item.  The eight-piece Hot Wings ($6) were grilled to perfection, with a firm meaty bite and sweet BBQ flavors that soon kicked in. The blue cheese dip was unnecessary, especially when the wings were not spicy at all. It was another good item to share.   The Fish Tacos ($6.5) came with double deck tortillas that were layered with blacken white fish, spicy slaw, pico de gallo, and tomatillo-avocado salsa. The fish was meaty, blackened with good flavor, but the spicy elements were again missing. The tomatillo-avocado salsa was a good addition, but the flavors could use a lift with a spicy citrus kick. Again, like other dishes, the food was good to share, but the flavors were kept too safe without any sort of risk-taking.   The Hummus ($8) turned out to be the most disappointing dish on the evening. It came with roasted garlic and siracha hummus that failed to distinguish from one to the other. The small, triangular pitas were served warm, but they were also stiff to the point it was crunchy. Epic fail, this was not a dish I would get again.  Overall, like many lounges, food was second nature when you have a wide array of drinks and great company. Service unfortunately was a hit or miss. However, the low-risk prices, along with the décor and ambiance culminated an enjoyable evening. Based on other reviews, I suggest for people to grab dinner elsewhere before coming here for a nightcap. Great for groups, I would return when I have out of town guests or special gatherings."}
{"text":"My friends and I are big brunch fans (though we don't do them nearly as often as we would like), especially when brunch has the option of mimosas. Mimosas are good stuff.  We've done a bottomless brunch before, but I'm not so great at holding my alcohol, so the Vig's $3/glass mimosa deal was perfect! Cheap, delicious, and gave me the perfect little buzz.   I ordered the enchiladas de pollo, which was deeeeeeeelicious. Highly recommend. Highly recommend the company too, but that one might be harder for you to come about :)"}
{"text":"Sat down to a 1/2 full patio at 1pm, took 25 minuets to get our drink order to the table and when it showed several of the drinks where terrible. No garnishes and the \"fresh\" sour mix was awful. Have been here several times and service has been slow before, guess things aren't changing. Hummus was good though."}
{"text":"So I already love The Vigs Arcadia and uptown locations, so I knew I was into the concept and the menu. Add in some cool cocktails - Melinda's Alley, do it - and amazing ambiance (dt phx, corn hole, huge patio, guys playing guitars), and The Vig Fillmore May be my new favorite Vig!  Side note: for those who remember, this is the old Palate location."}
{"text":"I used to live in Arcadia & always went to the Vig on 40th ; now I live in Scottsdale and frequent the McCormick ranch location & have always had a great experience. But I was pretty bummed when I went up to the bar at the Fillmore location and the bartender told me they didn't have any of the wines on the wine list ... what?.... My favorite wine they serve is Left Coast pinot, I get it every time I'm at the Vig (at the other locations) and they said they didn't have that, so I was like ok, no big deal. But then to tell me they \"probably didn't have anything on the wine list\" very odd. But the bartender poured me something & I liked it, so it worked out - just very weird. We then told the bartender we were going to a show at Comerica theater and he gave us 20% off the bill.. very nice. 1 glass of wine ; 1 draft beer ; 1 fire ball shot ; 1 gummy bear = $10 bar tab. Awesome. Just need to get the wine situation figure out, but that wont stop me from coming here."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday evening around 4:30, and there weren't a whole lot of people there so my friend and I were sat immediately! The server was so nice and had good recommendations on what to order. I had the seared mahi mahi with a salad, carrots, and sweet potato fries, and everything was AMAZING. The carrots were my favorite part. The food was ordered and out in a timely manner, and the server was very good about checking back with us to see if we needed anything else. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Another awesome bar I encountered during my quick trip to Phoenix. I went on a Sunday night and all the wine bottles were half priced. The bartenders were friendly and  the atmosphere was just how I like. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed by the time we showed up."}
{"text":"And another updated review! After my last post about being told the Pad Thai has fish sauce, the general operations manager got in touch about what went wrong. He checked with the executive chef, and the Pad Thai IS vegan if you leave off the egg (Yeay! It was delicious!). The hummus is vegan, but the breads served with it are not. However, they can sub in tortilla chips for the bread. The bean burger is vegan, but the bread (and obviously the mayo) is not. And the chef recommends the Asian chop salad, substitute tofu for the chicken. He's going to talk further with the staff about serving people with dietary restrictions (and I'm encouraging them to better mark the menu or offer a side menu for special diets).  I will try The Vig again sometime, so expect another update someday..."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and thought everything was all around okay.   The service to begin with was pretty bad and somewhat slow. I understand it was busy and have waited tables before - but the server just didn't seem to be very concerned with us.   Ordered the pork belly and watermelon appetizer, which was alright. Ordered the breakfast enchiladas and sent them back for being cold. They did give us a free mimosa for the enchiladas which was awesome.   Overall, I would think about going here again for lunch just because of the great drink deals and atmosphere. Definitely not in too much of a rush to come back though."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at The Vig. I was not impressed. It was well over 100 today and they make you wait outside to be sat inside. service was alright, she never announced her name or specials for lunch or drinks. I ordered the black bean burger and my grandmother ordered fish tacos and asked her to just give her the fish with a side of chips, no tortilla, she said she couldn't do that. They Have chips on their menu for nachos, she could of easily subbed chips for fries (known from experience in the industry). When the burger came to the table I swear it was real beef, I asked her about it and she said no it was a black bean burger.. What a Frozen Boca Burger they heated up on the grill. Smash burger and Pita Jungle both have way better black bean burgers, they taste and look like black bean burgers. After the food was dropped off we didn't see or hear from our server for 30 mins. The manager came by and asked how everything was and then the buss boy filled our drinks and cleared the table. We waited another 10 mins before the server came over to take our payment."}
{"text":"Went to The Vig on Sunday with a few buddies for late lunch around 3:30.  We sat in the bar area in a booth.  Our server let us know it was their anniversary and that their appetizers and drinks were half off, which we were pleasantly surprised to find out. It was packed given it was their anniversary but our server was great.  She continually checked in on us and made some great recommendations for lunch.  I had the posole soup which was awesome.    We had a great time and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Parking is horrible. There is not an actual parking lot. You parallel park in front of people's houses, then you walk to the Vig.   When we got there, the wait time was 30min or so the host sat us at the bar and she said she will get us when a table was ready. 30min past, and we haven't not heard from the host so I asked the bartender can we order food here and he said yes, so we did! I ordered Salmon and it was delish! So many different flavors in the plate, I wanted seconds, even thirds!   Half way through my plate, the host came to us and asked if we wanted to be seated at a table and we kindly said no we were fine and she walked away. Did not apologize for the long wait time. Customer service was eh, but the food made up for it!! I will definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"I had never been here fervor but me and my friend stopped here before the Dave Chappelle show. When we got there they said we would have to wait an hour but the patio was open. After sitting in  the wrong section Dan came and helped us. He made sure we got taken care and got our food in time to make the show. The hostess and all the other servers were incredibly nice and accommodating. I couldn't have been treated better. Thank you."}
{"text":"I. Love. It. Here. Sunday's are my favorite and I love the time of year they do \"locals only\" from 12-4. Brunch food is fantastic and the mimosas are good, of course. I enjoyed the Bloody Mary bar as well! Great atmosphere, great people, great food and that all makes up for a good time.   I highly recommend coming here for any meal ! (P.s. I hear their Mac and cheese is amazing- my next purchase)"}
{"text":"I almost gave them a 3 star rating but our server was really nice and helpful, and gave us great suggestions. Now this was not my first time here but it was my first time for brunch so my friend an I drove here from a long hike and were really looking forward to mimosas and brunch, and the place is wild and busy during on Saturdays. The seating hostess was there physically, but mentally was not. You didn't feel welcome when you walk up to her, no smile and definitely not a people's person. She wasn't rude at all but I think she would have preferred to being a patron today rather than work.   We waited about 30 minutes and our seats became available, while we waited we ended up getting 2 rounds of mimosas, the first round I got from the inside bar and I gave a $20 and got 14 back, the barkeep did tell me it was $3 mimosas and so I grabbed the 2 drinks for me and my friend and went outside. The second time around my friend got the Drinks and came back asking if I had said $3 or $3.50 each I said $3. He was puzzled as he gave a $20 and got $13 back. So here goes 1 inconsistency. Not sure if it's as a mistake or prices fluctuate from one person to the other.   We got seated and our server was super nice, I ordered the tofu scrambler and she said they can remove the tofu and add bacon and that is what I did, my friend ordered the steak and eggs with a side of Brussels sprouts and he was pretty happy with that.   I'll definitely come back since I like the food and servers in general are nice, but today not sure what happened with the seating hostess and the fluctuating bar prices."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon The Vig in downtown Phoenix while walking around checking out all of the Final Four festivities. The place is an absolute gem. The prices and very reasonable. We were not there during Happy Hour, but I have heard they have a good one. The outdoor patio seating is where the party is at. They have cornhole, a full bar, and just a awesome environment outside. I ordered the The Vig Dip and it was jam-packed with lots of meat and it was delicious. Also, we ordered the chips and salsa which were great, but one of the biggest stars of the show was the wings. They are baked, fried, grilled, and dripping with buffalo sauce. Sooooo Good! I recommended hanging out here for anyone who is wondering around downtown looking for a great spot to spend some time relaxing and eating good food."}
{"text":"The Vig is my neighborhood bar. It has a fantastic happy hour. The patio is fun and the perfect size. Food and drinks are you above average bar food but still comforting."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. Avoid this place. If not for the unprofessional \"chefs\" or rudest staff then for the cleanliness. Cat shit outside on tables, dirty playing cards that have to carry disease on table top and they are doing prep in the dish pit. Asking for diarrhea if you eat here. They are also part of genuine concepts so I'm sure this nastiness is company wide."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and each time I leave, I look forward to coming back. The short rib tacos are a perfect blend of Asian and Mexican concepts, and the chorizo burger was amazing (though honestly, I'll order anything on a menu with chorizo). Great craft beer selection, great service, and a really cool location. One of my favorites downtown!"}
{"text":"After a couple rough experiences at other Vig locations, the Vig Fillmore is a much better experience. Good food, good service and a good atmosphere brings it all together.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've only had fish tacos here. , they were good. But only the ones on the happy hour were affordable. Atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm a local to Roosevelt Row and when I heard that the Vig was opening up a location down the street from my house, I was super excited. Being a huge fan of the other Vig locations, I knew that this new one wouldn't disappoint. And what do you know? I. Was. Right.   The vibe is very chill and relaxed with low lighting both inside and outside. I've checked out the inside, but only sat outside so far because the weather is starting to feel like fall here in the valley. It has almost like a rustic vibe with these dark wood tones but then they incorporated metal and clean lines in their design for a modern touch. They have crisp green grass outside, which is always great in Phoenix, and it fits the Roosevelt Row feel by being an old home converted into the restaurant. Tons of trees hover around you and it's just a really neat, cozy, yet open space.   While we waited for a table, we were approached by a waiter right away to help us with drinks. Our actual waiter was also very helpful, fast to introduce himself and take care of us, and overall really great. The food is similar to the other Vig locations and it's just as delicious. We went on a Monday night for $5 burgers which is a ridiculous deal. The burgers are huge, you get your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or both, and it's all for just $5 friggin bucks!!! I really had a great time with my friends here - we enjoyed an awesome meal, good drinks, amazing service, and a great atmosphere. Definitely check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is good. Coronado cup is my favorite, sweet and fruity. Outdoor bar and seats are fun in the cool day."}
{"text":"Went to the phoenix suns game last night then rushed over to this restaurant to enjoy a quick good meal as we were starving and not many good places are available downtown. Was excited to eat here! Walked in at 10:50 (they serve food until 11) and we're told \" sorry, the kitchen already closed down and left... you can go drink outside at the bar though\" we got up and embarrassed walked out in front of 2 tables still eating looking confused?  Which i totally understand it is not cool to walk in so close to closing but during a late game night and given the selection downtown... (which is slim) I would think you should at least be mindful of that. Not to mention.... If you say you'll serve food until 11.... You should serve food until 11!  One a first date it was a pretty upsetting experience. I will not ever be returning to this location nor will I recommend anyone. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I have been to the other Vig restaurants and you get the same experience here. I think I like this location the best as it is in the downtown area and just a bit more space. Good dynamics with inside and outside depending on what you want for the night. Staff is friendly and helpful.   Had the Mac and Cheese with chicken and broccoli and it was delish. Would recommend. Good flavors and texture.   Sat inside this time and it was a good experience to allow for good conversations. Down side is the booths are squeezed a bit so there is not much room under the table for your feet and you will kick each other.   Beer selections are iffy, can get better selections some place else but the wine list is pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Vig for the second time last Sunday. We decided to try their brunch. We got there at noon and it was packed, however we did get a table right away so that was nice.  The place is really beautiful, nested in an old house, everything is renovated and modern. Their backyard/patio is huge, I love the outside bar!  I got the Eggs Benedict, the chipotle sauce was very good however the eggs was a bit over cooked. My husband had the Steak and Eggs, which was good. What I love the most about their brunch is their Mimosas for $3! Seriously, nobody can beat that!"}
{"text":"Finally, my bf and I decided to check out The Vig after hearing great things from my friends. I loved the open atmosphere and patio. I ordered a burger and fries and my bf ordered the Mac n cheese. The burger was made exactly how I requested and fries were perfectly seasoned. Nothing was overcooked or undercooked. Mac n cheese was really good too.   Now, where it gets not so stellar. The service was slow and there were noticeably large gaps between seeing our server. He was really nice, we just didn't see him a lot and ended up waiting a while to order/pay. I'm not upset by it because we did go on a Friday night so it was a bit busy. Will def go again to see how the service is a 2nd time around."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is cool, really like the patio area and also the \"inside\" seating which ya still feel like you are kinda outside. My first time here at this location. Wasn't impressed with the food at all, but loved the bloody Mary bar. Very fun to be able to make your own drink for $4. Got the daily flatbread and it wasn't very good. Hardly any chicken, but smothered in more than enough cheese to make hit rock bottom :/ Didn't hurt that our server Christopher was fun to look at and a really good server :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Vegan options. They will work with you and make it happen. Good food and stellar service every time. Solid."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I can't find fault with anything about this place. Numerous seating areas to accommodate your desire for music volume. Great brunch menu. Service was superb with personality and attentive care for our needs. It was a friend's birthday and they were given a nice birthday treat without request. The bar is nice, multiple areas to sit. Huge patio in front and back. I have been to all the Vigs and this might be my new fave. I didn't see the corn hole, though. Might have to hit the 16th street location for that...  We all love the food, the Vig burger was perfect. Personally, I usually go with the Asian chili wings. Sweet and sour and just enough heat."}
{"text":"The kale dip was spectacular and the fish tacos blew my mind! Love the vibe, very cool place!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me Waited an hour to get get a table. Then another 15 minutes and never got waited on. We won't be back!!!! WTF"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Tasty food, affordable prices, great vibe. Attentive service. Casual crowd. Valet parking.  Iced coffee and the iced coffee with vodka ...two thumbs up!  Only negative is that it was hard to find for us, but I'm sure someone who is not directions-challenged will be just fine."}
{"text":"This is the best happy hour spot in Arizona! You get so much food for little $. I love the out door seating area and live music. Make sure you try it out."}
{"text":"It's hard to find anything wrong with the vig. The atmosphere is rad, and the food is excellent. This to me is an ideal date spot for both new couples and ones like myself who have been married over a decade.  The apps are great and they have an excellent array of craft brews and a intelligent bar tending staff that makes great drinks. The pad Thai is legit awesome and one of my favorite things on the menu. The burgers are good and usually part of a happy hour deal. We also tried the Mac with bacon and it was done right. Even if it's packed they still get food out to you fairly quickly. The price point is fair and the restaurant and restrooms are always clean. The staff is always friendly as well. I would definitely recommend The Vig to my friends and fellow helpers. I hope you add this place to your list :)"}
{"text":"First trip and we are surrounded by a group of some jock-esque/douche-y guys ... certainly here on vacation from Scottsdale or elsewhere. I'm not sure why this place is in downtown. It does not speak to the neighborhood at all."}
{"text":"Best patio in downtown Phoenix.  I recommend the Hot Chick chicken sandwich or the Nachos.  The staff is top notch and super nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown spot....the ambiance, the look, the food and the service... I like coming here. I try to order something new every time but I always lean toward the Chicken sandwich or the Breakfast sandwich. The Hangover Helper and Chicken Enchiladas were so delicious.  The $2 mimosas go down like Holy Water...and did I mention the Build Your Own Blooday Mary Bar??!!! They are a dog friendly establishment, I believe on Saturdays. And if you are lucky, the yellow tabby with one yellow and one blue eye might let you pet him - after all, it is HIS place you're visiting. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere/ambience. Great for dates or family meal. Outdoor patio was like being in someone's backyard, but very classy. The food was delicious and drinks reasonably priced. I would recommend this restaurant to all of my friends. They will definitely find something for everyone."}
{"text":"My favorite place for happy hour or any hour for that matter. Monday-Friday they offer 11-6 happy hour on drinks and food! It has such a relaxing vibe, great customer service, as well as yummy food & drinks with live music on occasions. I also love that they offer half off bottles of wine on Sunday's! Outstanding place, truly"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. food is good. this one particular time the staff seemed annoyed. Not even a hello. -1 star for that."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Thursday night, got lucky and found parking right in front but otherwise you might have to work a little to find parking.  We got right in as we only had a party of 2.  Their old fashioned was good and the food was good too.  We enjoyed the trivial pursuit cards on the table for a little fun."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Vig, and per a friend's request I met her here to check out the new digs.  I think because they are new, they are working out the kinks but there is lots of promise.  So it's hard to notice this spot because as of yet, there is no signage. It's in a house.  I drove the street twice til I realized the house WAS The Vig. The indoors is the restaurant portion and the side of the house is the patio area.  There are grassy areas, which is a nice touch and they have a central bar with seating all around, tables and chairs throughout the courtyard, and a fireplace with Adirondack chairs/tables as well.  The tall fence blocks out the traffic and construction going on nearby.  The menu is slightly different than 'my' Vig, but is primarily very similar. The bar waitstaff was initially a little slow, although it did pick up and they were all very cordial and helpful.    I'll come back next time I'm downtown as I think if y ou're a downtown dweller this could turn out to be as great as the other Vigs."}
{"text":"The best server in the house is Dan/Daniel... However mgt made him serve our 26 top and several other 10+.... It started off really good, once we get our whole group there is was completely down hill... Almost every person has their order messed up and it took almost 45 minutes just to get a draft beer...   We were ready to leave made the mgr on duty aware of the situation and he did close to nothing about the situation, it all seemed like he told everyone to avoid our tables. How could one restaurant mess up a table so bad! At least half our table had our order messed up or not delivered after an hour and their reason was \"sorry we don't know what happened\"....   After we BEGGED for our tab for 30-45 mins by standing up and requesting several times, they finally hand it over with an auto 18% grat charge... Again. Daniel was great, however there is he had 3 or 4 tables with 10+ people... He could barely handle our 25 plus table and mgt wouldn't allow him otherwise. Like seriously VIg, realize that when a group makes a reservations for 25 people or requires a server by it's self or at least 2-3 servers!  Would NEVER recommend this again based on my experience tonight! Mgt really didn't care about our thoughts or concerns or that it took 2 hours to get food, I hope owners review this concern with mgt and realize there is an issue!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price!! Great place for a date night or special occasion dinner"}
{"text":"If you haven't heard of The Vig, you've probably been living under a rock. On Mars. The Vig is a fashionable fixture with high-end pub fare, with a brunch menu, music, outdoor seating & bocce court. Yes, you read that right, a bocce court! Okay, okay, but this is about the pub fare. And the most famous of their fares is the Mac-n-Cheese.  The Vig uses a Campanella noodle, allowing their signature flavors of american cheese, white cheddar, and gruyere cheeses to fuse nicely to the noodle. The flavor is a burst of buttery cheese followed by salty notes. Personally, it's a bit too salty for my pallet, but adding some crushed black pepper brings balance (for me).  Looking for something a bit lighter? Try their Sweet Potato Fries. Mmmmm. These paired excellent with an ice cold Four Peaks Peach Ale to nicely wash down the saltiness.   Looking for a drink? I'd recommend The Vigroni (Bombay Sapphire Gin, Aperol, Cocchi Americano, Hibiscus Simple Syrup and Fresh Lemon Juice). The taste of fresh lemon juice lingers softly on the tongue.   Overall, The Vig is a great spot to start your evening with light pub fares, signature cocktails, tasteful environmental design, and local craft brews. Priced fairly for the style of fare and ambiance you experience. But don't stay too long, as Phoenix has plenty to offer for dinner ;)"}
{"text":"The food was delish the atmosphere was great we had a good time in got the Mac and cheese with broccoli and bacon wow tasted so creamy and delish the guacamole and chips too yum. I will be going back"}
{"text":"I think I only have two check ins here. Whatever...   I have declared this location my favourite of all the vig locations. Some of the same staff as uptown, which I like. I can be sitting at the bar solo or with someone and the staff really treat you well. Making conversation on anything under the sun. Which is what one would like when sitting at the bar. If I'm at a table, leave me alone.   They have a really decent selection of craft beers on tap. I would love to have a way to know what's on rotation. In particular of all locations I love the outdoor bar here. This place used to be the local breeze and sitting out at the bar at the vig here brings back fond memories of hangover recovery Bloody Mary brunches.  The Vig Filmore is also going to be my pre Crescent Ballroom stop from here on out.   I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere.. Amazing service! Our waiter Jeremiah was super down to earth and made our first time very enjoyable!!! If you go ask for him he's super! Oh and DEF try the posole it's AMAZING!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for brunch and the eggs Benedict was awesome with a bit of a kick!  The dj was dope but the service could be a little better."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with two girlfriends who had flown in for a trade show in downtown PHX.  I was given a recommendation to come here after asking for a cool spot for dinner near downtown.   The Vig is nestled inside of an old home in a downtown neighborhood.  It is very trendy and definitely gay friendly if you are looking for a place like that.  There are two sections within the restaurant- a real \"dining room\" and then an addition on to the original structure (think sunroom).  Outside is a relatively large, sull service bar. Service was ok...nothing great.  The waiter wasn't super knowledgeable about the menu so he's leave us to go ask questions and then come back.  Drinks are pretty expensive here. $12 for a house cocktail seemed expensive to me, but maybe that;s just downtown pricing.  Our table ordered the chicken nachos and they were delicious.  REALLY delicious.  I would definitely recommend those.  I ordered a steak salad (medium rare) and when it came out it was RAW.  Like blue raw.  The salad itself was good, but I only ate the outer edges of the steak.  It's a shame because what I DID eat was pretty delicious.  My dining partners had the Mac n Cheese and said it was delicious.  They appeared to not even be able to make a dent in the portion provided and took a huge to-go container with them back to their hotel.  I'd come back if I was in the area, but I'd skip the steak next time."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar was good, food was delicious and atmosphere was good. Football was on as well. I'd recommend this place to friends :)"}
{"text":"I received violent food poisoning from this restaurant which landed me in the emergency room for an entire day. Repeated attempts to contact management and operations of the Vig Fillmore and their parent company Genuine Concepts have been ignored."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. While it seems more like an adult place, it is surprisingly kid friendly with a great kids menu."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants for a date night. Everything was awesome at The Vig (Fillmore)... Start to finish. The atmosphere, service, and food were perfection. I love the various areas that you can sit at The Vig. We started off in the bar and watched a bit of football, and ended our night on the patio listening to live music (shout out to Vinyl Station who perform on Sundays). We enjoyed a bottle of wine (50% off on Sundays), and our server helped us select a wine that we absolutely loved after we told him wines we enjoyed. The wine was Pine Ridge, and if you enjoy a white wine, it was a lovely choice. My husband had the Prime Vig sandwich with a side of pozole. He raved about his sandwich and shared a few bites of his beautifully flavorful pozole. I had been dreaming of the steak salad since the last time I enjoyed a dinner at The Vig. I went to a different Vig location the first time I ordered the salad, but the consistency was seamless. This steak salad was just as stellar as the one I had a year+ ago and from a completely different location... Not always easy to achieve when restaurants expand like that. I'm not sure I will ever order anything else at The Vig because I am so hung up on that particular salad. We treated ourselves to strawberry shortcake for dessert. It was not your typical strawberry shortcake, as it was served in a mason jar. I am a dessert lover (as in I look at the dessert menu first) and this one goes down as one of my top-five favorites. It had a cinnamon sponge cake, similar to the flavor of a churro, with fresh strawberries and whip cream. It was the ideal ending to our meal."}
{"text":"A group of us went to The Vig Fillmore last night before heading over to Crescent Ballroom for a concert. I've been to The Vig in Arcadia and the one off of 7th Street several times, but this one is by far my favorite! I love their big open back patio and outdoor bar area, it's so perfect for a beautiful night like we had last night. As usual, the food did not disappoint (we ordered chips & guac along with the steak salad) and the drink selection is great there! I ordered a cocktail that I wish I could remember the name of, but it had champagne and was absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed that they have beers on tap that aren't totally commonplace (Opposable IPA by historic was super yummy!) We will be back the next time we spend time downtown :)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite brunch spots in all of Phoenix! This has a really fun patio that I recommend going and sitting on on the weekends. This is one of my favorite Vig locations just because of the patio. The food is excellent if you're hungover I highly recommend the pozole along with the build your own Bloody Mary bar. Parking is a little tricky so prepare to pay for meter parking especially on the weekends but believe me it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Vig Fillmore for brunch on a hot Saturday afternoon, sat on the patio to enjoy the full Vig experience.  What I Ordered: -Tito's Bloody Mary Bar ($4) -Guac and Chips ($8)  Drinks: -Bloody Mary, at $4, is hard to beat. This special is only made with Tito's vodka (cannot be changed to gin for example). You're given a glass with ice and vodka, and you build the rest yourself. The bartender may forget to tell you, so go to the inside bar (either entrance) and the bloody mary bar is stationed on the end. -fixins: bacon, pickled asparagus, olives, cocktail onions, celery, various hot sauces (Tabasco, etc), black pepper, salt.  Food: -the guacamole (and the chips) were really good, I ate the whole thing without a second thought. -considered ordering an actual meal but it was hot as h### and I didn't feel like touching anything above 80 degrees.  Ambiance: -the patio was particularly crowded... and loud. -a lot of complaints about people smoking. I didn't see a single person (not that it would bother me because we're OUTSIDE).  -misters going in certain areas, none directly over the bar unfortunately. -TVs over the bar -live jazz band playing on the patio  Staff: -the patio bartender I had was not the least bit friendly, and not just to me. He seemed more interested on socializing with those he personally deemed interesting and worth his time. Funny, cuz I'm a great tipper and an excellent conversation partner. -inside bartender was much more pleasant; in fact, all other staff were helpful and polite.  Parking: -had to park about 2 blocks away on the street in front of a condemned house; wish they'd get a better parking situation.  I'll be back to visit the Vig every so often, just so that I can brunch in a brunchy atmosphere and pretend like Arizona isn't a sweltering desert pit of despair. Bring on the bloody marys!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.    The tater tots are particularly good.  Beer is pretty good, too.  However, I don't agree with their smoking policy.  If I want to sit outside, I should be able to sit wherever I want and not have to inhale second-hand cigarette smoke.  The Vig is now officially boycotted and I will schedule all of my business meetings elsewhere."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went here for our weekly Friday night out dinner. We both loved this place!! We asked to sit outside because we saw how lively and nicely decorated it was. BEST DECISION! If the weather is nice and you're comfortable with sitting outside, do it!! The area is adorable, its decorated with such cute string lights going across the area as well as being in the trees. There's also an outdoor bar with TVs, which is awesome! As far as the food goes, I ordered the Poke Bowl with a side of watermelon. The watermelon wasn't something on the menu, but the server was more than happy to serve it. My roommate ordered the wings (half thai and half traditional) and she said they were great! I was already pretty stoked to be there just because of how cool the outside area was and the food honestly made it even better. If you're in the area or want to try something new, come check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Vig. It is always a great place to go and always good food. On my latest visit, I ordered the Blackened Chicken BLT. It was pretty good, but I have to say the Grilled Chicken Sandwich is better and one of my favorite chicken sandwiches ever. I love this location, especially the outside. I could hang out for hours there!"}
{"text":"What a perfect lunch spot. This is my third visit here and it just gets better each time. Today I sat at the bar. The bartender Jordan made me laugh more than once and had the best recommendations. If you're in the area you have to stop in and try the Brussel sprouts best thing I've had in forever! Great service from an obvious happy staff and yummy food."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Vig in the valley.  I visited The Vig Fillmore a few days ago for a little Christmas gathering and had a great time. The servers were a little slow but we had a larger party so it's understandable to some extent. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it was HUGE, I would definitely recommend sharing it with someone; i ate half. The sandwich came with some good home fry type potatoes and of course I was sipping some $3 mimosas. The atmosphere was very nice and upbeat, the patio is the only way to go IMO since it is very beautiful, spacious and airy. They did have a BYO Bloody Mary bar and I'd like to try that next time. The server didn't offer it to us so I was a little bummed I was already on my mimosa train when I found out, oh well next time!  Anyway, my friends loved the pozole (you can order big or small btw) and green chicken enchiladas. My mom ordered the hangover helper and it was DELISH! I'll definitely be back! Keep up the Great work Vig Fillmore, it doesn't go unrecognized!!"}
{"text":"I like the convenience of this place. It's close to home and it's a nice break from downtown. The patio is pretty sweet. The best thing on the menu is the Mac n Cheese. It's made with 3 different cheeses and you can add chicken or shrimp but I like to add the BBQ short rib. It is yummy and the portion is so large you have enough for lunch the next day at work. It reheat beautifully! If you're thinking about the Vig Nachos with the carnitas...go for it...pretty delicious but it is a LARGE order so be ready to eat. You can't really take nachos home for later."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour!  We had the fish tacos and beef sliders.  Great selection of beer and wine!  Jenna the bartender is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Inside (non-patio) review: it was ok. Server was attentive...but not. Like checked on us a lot but didn't actually pay attention to us or what we said. For example, I asked for my sandwich WITHOUT chipotle mayo-it came with it, didn't keep water filled, and then refilled my ginger ale with water, brought the wrong check... Overall it was nice, my table just wasn't of priority. Not super expensive, but I do work for my money, and will spend it more wisely next time I go out."}
{"text":"Before heading back to LA we stopped here to eat. It's kind of hidden looks like a house so drive slow its on the corner. I had the chicken strips with fries. The fries were the best part good seasoning on the fries. I don't drink but the cool thing is they have a DIY Bloody Mary bar so you can create it to what you like."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner here and had to send back the mac-n-cheese and my salad was soaked in dressing. Ugh. Stick to just the happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm new to the valley but I somehow always end up here, highly intoxicated, after a long night of drinking before last call. I love the patio (there are heaters everywhereeeeee) and can't quite remember what the inside is like; but from what I do remember, the staff is awesome. Rad neighborhood spot for sure."}
{"text":"Started with the ARTICHOKE, KALE & ROASTED JALAPEÑO DIP. Comes out in a small black skillet hotter than hell. Once it drops a few hundred degrees and you get a taste. It's over. Best warm dip I have ever had. For dinner I ordered black bean burger and sweet potato fries. Very good. I was getting full so I took the bin off the top. Full of flavor but it's a heavy meal. Love al the vegetarian options here."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the vibe in downtown Phoenix, but this place blew my mind. Such an awesome atmosphere, great drinks, and awesome food! The outdoor space is really nice, and they have plenty of misters so it keeps you nice and cool if it's hot outside. The staff is also really friendly which is nice too.  Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a cool spot to hang out at downtown!"}
{"text":"The vibe in here is cool.  Hip Bar/Restaurant.  The crowd is young.  downtown spot to grab a bite to eat and a cool drink.  Special family recipe of  Pozole was very tasty. The portion is large and very sharable. They were kind to split into 2 bowls.   Trifecta sliders with choice of fries:  sweet potato or regular. Served with curry mayo.  Again nice and savory.   The servers recommended our dinner and we usually take their advice and that was perfect dinner.   Thanks for a great meal after a long drive from Vegas.   We'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I wan to love them place more then I do because of the location. The staff makes me anxious. They seemed rushed and a bit jittery. Arrrrrg. But I still go and enjoy the electric neighborhood"}
{"text":"First time to the Vig it's was a great day to sit in the awesome patio and listen to some live music. The staff was very friendly and service was good on a semi busy Sunday. With all that said the kicker was that the food was great for brunch bottomless mimosas for the wife great drinks for me. I am coming back next time in am in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service!  I don't know where the begin...  Terrible food They forgot my order, forgot to offer refills and forgot about our table..   The waiter thought he was more important that his clients.    I will never eat at this establishment ever again.  I've been going for years, but it has been going downhill since.   It's done.  Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Middle of March 2017. Went here with the wife and mother in law. Sat outside on the gorgeous patio. Location was awesome, food was tasty. I had a noodle bowl. It was slightly spicy, but very delicious. Good amount of food too, which I love! Service was quick and efficient. Bathrooms were clean, easy access  Overall we all liked it."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Vig Uptown but finally made my way downtown. And more importantly, I finally tried the brunch. Soooooo good! The breakfast sandwich was amazing. I tried to recreate it at home the next day and it wasn't nearly as good. The service was kind of on the down side, but we were placed outside where only two bartenders were working lots of tables and the bar. Minus the service/having to sit outside - I highly recommend it! Good spot for a Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"First time going to The Vig at this location, and it will also be my last.  A couple of friends and I decided to have lunch here today and boy do I wish we went somewhere else.  We arrived and the hostess was very friendly (young girl with long hair) asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  The weather was nice so we decided outside.  As I observed the seating area outdoors it was not too bad, and not too busy.  I got up and  gone to the bathroom and returned to the server stating that he would bring me a water.  As he came back, I started to drink my water in a glass that was cracked down the side.  I patiently waited for my server to return.  When he didn't, my friend stopped another server and told her about my water.  The server took my glass and said, \"I will bring you another one.\"  (Except she never came back).  As an employee came out with our appetizer, we asked him if we could not only get my water but refills..   He was nice enough to help his fellow employee out and brought us more water.    Our food came out, I ordered the Greek salad with no chicken.  It came out and I began eating it only to notice this one spot where it almost looked like dirt.  I decided to rub it between my fingers because there was no way that it could have been dirt in my salad.  Especially not at this fine establishment.  I mean I was willing to pay 13 dollars for some lettuce, olives, 2 pieces of feta, and 1 garbanzo bean.. oh wait I forgot and some dirt aka oregano.     I called my server over to tell him what I had found.  He decided to take my salad and call over the chef.       I waited and waited (btw I was so hungry).  Finally someone named Liza came over (who appeared to be the manager).  Who btw made no eye contact and I felt like what was supposed to be an apology was just rude and condescending.  She basically told me she was sorry but that was not dirt.  It was oregano and she comped my salad and walked away (acting like that's what I was looking for).  She was not sincere at all, and I felt like she did not even care.  Did I mention I was still hungry. Yeah, um she didn't ask if I wanted anything else.. or if I wanted to see the menu.. just walked away.. um really.. what ever happened to good customer service!?   This was the worst experience EVER!  I would not recommend this place to my enemy!  So unprofessional anddddddd as soon as my bill came the server finally apologized.  Really Brian!?  In all of my life I have never not left a tip, even if my service was bad.  I guess there is a first time for everything.  And it wasn't only due to the dirt salad.. it was the fact that your service sucked too!"}
{"text":"I love this old building and especially the outdoor bar area.  Plus it's close to work and has a great happy hour.  Last week, I went there with Linda W. and Ginger O. for my b-day dinner (last minute). They have great happy hour deals and so it's best to have the Vig on your social feeds so you can see what they are, because I always forget!  It's pretty much the same menu as the other Vigs in town.    On Mondays, I found out that the burgers are less than usual, so I got the burger with an egg, bacon, cheese on it.  It was awesome and I split it with Ginger because it was so big.    Our waiter overheard Linda saying it was my birthday, and without asking they made me a homemade brownie cake with ice cream on top.  It was awesome and thank you for the treat!   I will have to try out their brunch later on this Fall/Winter.  So glad the Vig made its way to the downtown neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to go on a date or in a large group of friends. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and a full open bar. On Saturday night they had a DJ as well who was playing music in the background but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you. The service is very good and there is a wide array of drinks from the bar. The only thing that was a little subpar was the quality of the food. The fish tasted a little bit old and some of the food was overcooked. However I did have a very good experience and would consider trying it again"}
{"text":"Really great brunch. My girlfriend and I aren't normally on this end of town, living in surprise, but since I had an appointment close to here we figured we'd give it a try. The bloodymary Bar is definitely on point! They have a ton of different hot sauces. All the fixings. And even bacon.  I had the chorizo burrito and it was really well done. Normally I worry about chorizo being too greasy but it wasn't but still flavorful.  Girlfriend had the huevos rancheros and they use mazza instead of a corn tortilla and it made all the difference in the world.  Very chill atmosphere, and super friendly staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good seating options including a fantastic patio with an outdoor bar w TVs, nice adirondack chairs on grass, heaters, a bags/Cornhole set-up, heaters and fans!  Inside the bar is great. Awesome decor.  The service is great too!! Happy hour pricing is a bit high. Apps are pricey!  Great draft beers."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for drinks and had a great time.  I have been to the other Vigs and this one is my favorite. Wonderful setting with lots of outdoor seating and a nice bar. Would like to come back when the weather is cooler to chill on their patio. Great service, wonderful food and drinks!  Will be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love the Vig and finally had the opportunity to check out their latest addition. I ordered their Fillmore Burger but made a few modifications to it (I replaced the cheddar with blue cheese, yum). I usually don't order burgers but I was in the mood for one. It was so good. I love when a burger has that charred crust to it. I also had the side of sweet potato fries which are amazing. The secret sauce is a kind of curry sauce which is strangely addicting when you dip the sweet potato fries in them.  We sat outside as it wasn't too hot and they had the misters on full force. The outside patio is great. There's lots of room in between tables so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of one another. Only complaint are the flies. I think it's the area though as they're a problem next door at Cibo too. I was busy swatting away flies as I was trying to enjoy my meal as they kept landing on our food and drinks every other second which was kind of annoying and off putting. If I were to go back to this location I'd ask to sit inside next time unless they can figure out a way to get rid of those pesky flies."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best posole in town. Also very tasty nachos. Great place to hang on the patio and enjoy the AZ weather."}
{"text":"The Filmore Vig is a great spot for meeting groups and hanging out downtown. They do brunch with unlimited mimosas (that can be dangerous), and a bloody mary bar. The patio is big and there is always seating around the bar or on one of the big lawn tables.   The servers are friendly and quick to clean up the tables. The happy hour food (especially the hummus, wings and sliders) are a must try. They valet, which is nice because it is hard to find parking downtown.  Uptown still holds my heart, but this is a close second."}
{"text":"What can I say?  A fan at first sight!  Patio presence!    Immediately the option of outside was my only requirement because I heard the food here is incredible.  So here we are.  We ordered a sandwich and a specialty dish off the Vig menu.    The first was the Vanilla braised short rib tacos - on flour tortillas w/Asian sweet glaze, house made Kimchi, spicy aioli and crispy shallots ($15).  I thought the flavor had a good mix of flavor and balance with the sweet Asian glaze on the short rib counterbalanced with the Kimchi spice and subtle flour tortilla and then finally an added crunch from the fried shallots.  Definitely squeeze some lime juice onto your taco because there's a lot of sweetness in the glaze.  Overall a yummy taco.    The second dish was the Prime Vig Dip - sliced medium rare beef, smoked gouda, grilled onions, chipotle mayo au jus ($14).  Oh and also with an included side - onion rings today.  The onion rings were huge and expected to taste just as it would....greasy goodness.  The sandwich was meaty and moist and really worked nicely with the melted cheese and sauce.  You can't go wrong with sauce and especially if cheese is one of the ingredients in a sandwich.  Dipped in the au jus.... mmmmmm.  These were great suggestions!!  I would love to come back and try another top 2 entree."}
{"text":"Soooo this place is tagged as dog friendly...that's a big fat nope. Only on Saturday! Literally ONLY Saturday. No other day of the week. On a huge patio. Huh? So dumb. Got there with my extremely chill small dog tonight for happy hour with a friend and got denied. I love their wings but come on! Can't. Ciba was amazing btws."}
{"text":"Pretty good food selection, and I like the outdoor area. I've been here a few different times, and only had food once. I got the fish tacos and they were good! All of their bartenders are very friendly. If it's busy, it can take quite a while to get your food (have tagged along for brunch) but I'm not sure if that's always common."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and food was mediocre.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"This Vig Fillmore is downtown Phoenix (or what I consider downtown), which I love to visit when ample parking is available, on the street. I had dinner at the Vig Uptown recently and decided to venture here to see the differences.   I couldn't get over how great the turkey sandwich was at the Uptown Vig, so I ordered it again here. I know, but, why try something different when this creates such an awesome sensation in my mouth. Even though there are several great choices on the menu here, I'm just stuck in a rut, but a good rut! I even ordered the same side (roasted brussel sprouts), and I have to say that these were cooked to perfection (I was not a fan of the other ones I had at the Uptown, but these were great). Of course, the pickle is always a nice addition to the meal. I did take a taste of the macaroni, and even though it has fantastic reviews, I'm just not a mac n cheese lover, but the person in my party who ordered it thought it was tasty!  Wait staff was great here, too. There are a couple of screens around that you can watch whatever is on if that's your thing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From the minute w e walked in we were greeted and asked for how many. There was a wait seeing that it was Sunday brunch, which is very popular here, so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and we ordered the horchata drink. Totally butchered that! It was delicious. Our food did take a little longer than normal so the manager took off an appetizer without us saying a word. Food is amazing, service is phenomenal, will always recommended and come back!"}
{"text":"Jace is beyond a great bartender! My gf and I drove over from Orange County CA for the packers vs cardinals game and looked on yelp for a place to eat/grab drinks. We came in Saturday for drinks only and have was out bartender! He is very personable and helpful! We enjoyed it so much we came back Sunday after the game so we could try out the food, again jace was our bartender and gave phenomenal service! This place is a great date spot! Drinks food and service was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Love the downtown VIG!   Like the other Vigs the vibe is the same. A nice outside setting with some great ambience. I especially like the way this location took a 100 year old house and converted it to an inside bar.   The food is amazing as all Vigs are. I went with the Tater Tots, the NYC Reuben and my GF went with the Fish Tacos.  I would highly recommend my alteration which was suggested by my waiter. He told me to take the Reuben, put it on Pretzel Bread and get a side of Au Ju Sauce, delightful it was.  I will be back and look forward to the next live music acoustic set which they seem to always nail."}
{"text":"Why, oh why does this always happen to me?:  I find food that I really like - then...the restaurant changes the recipe.  For worse.  Went back for a re-up of yam fries twice now and they were completely destroyed.  Tasted like cardboard.  Vig cooks are coating the yams with some fry stuff that makes the fries hard and way overcooked.  I'm not happy at all.  Pas du tout!  On top of that the curry sauce tasted sweetened.  Yuck!  Will not be ordering yam fries again.   Damn you, Vig!  Damn you!   Fish tacos are a'ight, so maybe I'll go back for those.  No time soon though."}
{"text":"The service is a bit slow. Overall I like the atmosphere especially in the spring when you can sit outside and the DJ is spinning. The food is good, especially the Hot Vings. Prices aren't too bad for food but you may want to catch brunch if you're going for cocktails because drinks are pricey. I'll defientaly be back."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time at the Vig, I have done the Vig for happy hour plenty of times which their happy hour is awesome food and drinks and great prices. This is my first time doing dinner and it was cool. I ordered a salad, the Greek it was yum. Friends ordered the Mac and cheese and another the black bean burger. Everyone was satisfied. The service was good. The price point is average. The vibe was nice. Its a great spot when the weather is great for indoor/outdoor. Great patio."}
{"text":"The food was great! I got the Mac and cheese which was amazing. But our server (Kayla) was really rude from the moment we sat down. There was a party of 20 college girls more than half were not even old enough to drink let alone pick up the entire tab when we were finished.  The server assumed that one individual would pick up the tab  once we were finished dining. When we explained we would all be on separate tabs she gave serious attitude and told us it would take her a long time.  20 minutes later we finally got our tab....   I would come back again! But specifically request to not have this server EVER AGAIN.   PS. i wrote this entire Yelp as we waited a century."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time yesterday. We sat on their beautiful patio which provides a great atmosphere. Their staff was very nice and professional. I had the Trifecta (3 sliders on pretzel buns) looked delicious but seemed a bit dry. They won me over by having a full bar and good beers on draft. I am for sure coming back."}
{"text":"I called to see if we can make reservation since it was really hot and we can't wait outside.  A guy answered and said they don't take reservation for less than 9 but it shouldn't be a problem for 4 since they're not busy.  We arrived and the hostess said that it was a 45 min wait.  I told her that I've called.  She replied that she doesn't know who I talked to and it's not true.  She wouldn't let us wait in the inside bar when it was 115 degrees outside.  The outside bar does not have one fan or mister turned on.  It was not even shady.  This is AZ, folks.  No offer for water or drinks while we waited outside.  We would leave but our friends were coming, parking and starting to walk in.  We thought we give it a try.  We should have known better.  The food was just OK.  My Hangover something was just tortillas mashed with pork and an egg on top.  The Breakfast Sandwich looked like it came from Jack in the Box.  The burger was meh.  The Steak Salad was oily and soupy.  I don't know why people raved about this place. The place was small, dark, dirty and dingy.  When we left, we said to each other that it was still so hot.  The hostess then chimed in and said, \"try being outside all day like me\".  We WERE outside and we're the paying patrons paying her wages.  She is paid to work there.  If she's so concerned, she should ask her manager to set up her hostess stand inside.  She also said, \"this place is better in the Winter, not so much now\".  Thank you, Sherlock girl, for that tip.  If the guy answering the phone and she would have told us that first, we wouldn't have came and stayed.    I wouldn't go back for the parking (there were none), the poor customer service and especially the foods.  Downtown Phoenix has many great places to eat at.  Don't go here.  Don't let the \"Best Brunch\" sign fool you.  The management needs to train the staff to be more hospitable and make better dishes."}
{"text":"This one is disappointing to write because I wanted to love this place like everyone else does. We got here around 10:45 in the morning and it wasn't crowded. We were seated promptly and our waitress came over for drink orders. She was pleasant. 4 of us decided on the Bloody Mary's. For my brunch I got the corned beef hash meal since everything else has pork in it. Once we got our glasses with vodka, we had to go to the \"Bloody Mary bar.\"....the bar had the Bloody Mary mix, olives, sausage sticks, bacon, horseradish, salt and pepper, and a bunch of different sauces...what do you think is missing?...HOW ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE?! I don't eat pork so bacon and sausage was out for me. I didn't have that many options. When We asked for pickles and pickle juice (pickle juice is one the main ingredients for a Bloody Mary), the extremely rude and snarky bartender replied with \"whatever is there is all we have.\" We let her bitchy response go and went back to our seats.  The last time I went to a place that had a Bloody Mary bar, there were so many options that you could make a meal of it. Let's not false advertise, Vig.  When we got back, our food arrived and looked amazing...and then the guy who brought the food out had one extra plate of food...we told him it wasn't ours...and he started telling us what it was...WE KNOW WHAT IT WAS...IT WASNT OURS! There were 5 of us and he brought a 6th plate out and tried to make US seem like idiots when he was the real idiot.   My plate was OK. It lacked the flavor I expected and the poached eggs tasted like chunks of water. There was giant chunks of pure fat corned beef. I would rate it a 4 on scale or 1 to 10. The Bloody Mary tasted like tomato paste...awful. We asked our waitress for pickles and pickle juice...and they DID have it. That ended up making the bloody Mary's tolerable.   I was extremely unsatisfied and disappointed here. Needless to say, I will not be back or recommend this place. I MIGHT give the other location a try once I'm over what happened here."}
{"text":"I often find myself here when my friends are craving cocktails. The Vig, with several locations across the valley, is about atmosphere, American food, and cocktails. Fillmore maintains an ample space for your socializing needs in the form of one of the better patios in the valley. On the rare occasion it's below 80 degrees at night (It's September, I'm *so* over summer), I'm sure this would really shine.  I don't mind sitting out on warm nights, but I'm starting to realize how much of an impact that can make on drinks--while the cocktails appeal appetizing, almost all of them come to you diluted, a product of mixing with warmer products. This doesn't matter at all with basic items, but really messes up more complex refreshments. On paper, the Chim Chareu (Gin/aloe/watermelon/cucumber) is the beverage of my dreams. In reality, it just tasted like cucumber water. Every time I've been here, the cocktails have been mediocre. A similar lack of detail is paid to the less pricey drinks. Yes, Tito's for $4 is choice! But you should probably order it straight-up. Both times I tried one with tonic, it was absolutely flat!  That's not very nice. :-(   But for what it lacks in liquor, The Vig makes up with three groovy qualities:   -Stellar happy hour bites  -More than fair craft beer prices  -Servers who are attentive and know how to stay organized while covering a large area.   I'd recommend this as a cool spot to have a blast with large crowds. I look forward to having an app or two and plenty of beers with my pals. Just come in expecting a solid American restaurant, and you'll leave content."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and sat outdoors. There was complimentary valet parking out back for The Vig customers which was great because there was no parking available near by. The setting was really nice with high walls for privacy, a nice fireplace burning and string lights running above (would look great at night). I went with a bacon Bleu cheeseburger and my friend had the tacos, both were great. I saw some hot wings and nachos delivered to tables near by that immediately let me know I'd be returning to try. Good drink menu as well with a nice \"locals only\" menu from 12-4. Overall really was diggin my first trip to The Vig. Check it out when your downtown"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I was impressed! The wait was 5 mins and we got a perfect seat outside with a view of the tv. Perfect place to take your significant other the lights are set the perfect mood. Service was great along with the food I would definitely come back another time!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are on the hunt for brunch mimosas around the Valley and decided to try The Vig's $3/glass mimosas on a Sunday. The mimosas were good! I felt that the champagne-OJ ratio was well done. I ordered the chicken enchiladas from their brunch menu and enjoyed that as well. I've been to other Vig locations but this was my first time for brunch. It made me wish that the brunch menu was bigger, more specifically for the food items. Overall, I still had a good time for brunch.  We were seated outside in the patio and even with misters on, it was warm for an early-September in Phoenix. There's not a designated parking lot but there's plenty of street parking, so that wasn't an issue even on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I really like the Vig.  I do.  I just dig it.   I have yet to sit inside because thier patio is just such a relaxing space.  I love the way they have converted this old house, you feel like you are hanging out in some rich kids backyard. Plus, brunch on weekends is a real deal.  Their bloody mary bar can suffice as all the breakfast you need with all the bacon and pickled vegetables.  But then you wouldn't want to miss out on the menu items, would you?"}
{"text":"I met a friend for brunch this morning and ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. The menu advertised 2 biscuits topped with gravy, topped with an egg and breakfast potatoes. NEVER AGAIN! What a disappointment!! The biscuits were like scones, the gravy was like hummus, the egg looked fake and I got 4 little breakfast potato squares with a mound of bell pepper and onions, oh and my food was COLD and the \"gravy\" covered 1/2 of ONE of my biscuits, so the other biscuit and a 1/2 was bare and hard with a hockey puck feel. I had 1 mimosa and a bloody mary from the bloody mary bar. Mimosa came from a pre-made batch, so I couldn't ask for a little less juice (I get heartburn from too much OJ) and the Bloody Mary bar was extremely overwhelming. Why so many bottles (like 40) of hot sauce? That makes no sense!! 1 star for the bacon. Grabbed 5 pieces of those bad boys to make up for the crappy breakfast I was eating.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband. The service was good and we did not have to wait very long for our food to arrive despite how busy they were. My husband loved his burger, he had the chorizo burger. I had the mac and cheese which was just ok. I only gave 3 stars because I feel their menu is lacking and could use a bit more variety. There is nothing else I would like to come back and try, although my husband would come back for the burger."}
{"text":"It was a relatively cool evening in PHX so we were able to sit out on the patio to eat dinner. The patio is great and I would recommend sitting outside if you can. We started with the Guacamole App, which is discounted until six for happy hour pricing. The Guacamole was solid with a strong chip to Guac ratio. They had a good drink menu for Happy Hour too.   We moved on to the Entrees which involved a lot of salad and Mac and Cheese. At the table we got the Greek, Strawberry Field and Avocado Cobb. All looked great and were big servings with what looked like fresh ingredients.   A number of us got the Mac and Cheese. There are a number of meat additions you can add to it if you would like. We got it with Grilled Chicken and one with Short Ribs, which were great. You can also get it baked if you would like it that way (I recommend it).   I got the recommended house burger, The Vig. The flavor of the burger was good and I am always a fan of a fried egg on my burgers. If there was anything lacking on this one it would be the bun. I just didn't think it added anything to the burger. They offer the option of a variety of sides for the burger and I opted for the Mac and cheese and was very happy with that choice.   The service was great and the atmosphere was great. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place feels special - all tucked away in a beautiful old school downtown phoenix neighborhood. Walking up it feels upscale but not stuffy - very comfy and the outside layout is super chill and nice. There happy hr is awesome and very affordable - i had the pinot Grigio and  the hummus offered for happy hr - it was 4 bucks and huge! Mom had the fish tacos and thought they were very nice - perfect way to kick off first fridays before the walk:))) our server Brooks was knowledgable and super friendly! They offer complimentary valet which is sooooo convenient. I will deff be back @the vig - its a downtown must do spot :)))"}
{"text":"The best vegetarian pad Thai ever! Large serving allows for a midnight snack! Spices and flavor was perfect!"}
{"text":"The Vig has always been consistent. Friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Good times. Unexceptional food.  Went for brunch with an old friend. A couple of cheap mimosas at the bar. Long wait for table, but hostess told us it was long.  Got to table and was forgotten by wait staff. 20 minutes before anyone said boo. Finally someone showed and ordered another mimosa and brunch.  Eggs Benedict showed up 30 minutes later stone cold, with spinach that I asked to not be included and over cooked.  Again, you go to the Vig for atmosphere and vibe, not for food.  But cold hard boiled eggs are not what I want to spend my money on.  Told the waiter how cold the eggs were and they apologetic and said they would take care of it and what else could they do to make it up for the time and quality problem.  I got another mimosa and a fresh order of eggs (which were better than expected).  When the bill came, I was charged for everything. No attempt to make it right.  I'd gladly pay for food served timely and close to what is described on the menu. But to wait, get the wrong order, then cold eggs and be told that they were taking care of it and it not happening. Not good service.  They're a better operation than that."}
{"text":"What's happening to The Vig?  The new menu and drink list are looking very corporate.  Almost all the wines are grocery store selections.  Hopefully this is just a phase..  you are better than this!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give it more than one star, but I never got to try it out  We were told 30min wait...looked around open tables everywhere on a Saturday night  Not sure what's going on, but never got to try it  We gave up after 30 min Perhaps because it was before closing and they were cutting employees...it was 10:50pm Saturday"}
{"text":"The server was uninformed and not very friendly. When asked if the mahi was fresh, she said she didn't know. I ordered the salmon as a healthy alternative, but it was swimming in oil and inedible. It sat in a pool of oil. Really gross.   To their credit, they did take the salmon off my bill. I told them not to, because I ate the fish- but they did, so I appreciate that.  Server never smiled once after we told her and showed her the grease.  Friend ordered a rib eye. Sure looked like a New York from where I was sitting. Not like any rib eye I've ever seen. Should have taken a photo.   No misters outside? It's summertime in Phoenix. Miserably hot in the best seating area- the courtyard. Or maybe they just had them turned off on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a gloomy Tuesday and the place was pretty empty (think we caught the end of the lunch crowd). To begin with, this place is hard to find. If you knew the previous establishments that were here, you will be just fine, but if you don't- make sure you have your google maps app out!   The decor is beautiful, inside and out. We chose to sit inside, and you just don't feel like you are in Phoenix. Everything was orderly and clean, and it was just beautiful. Did I mention that it was beautiful? Good.  Got to chatting with the bartender and manager, both of whom's names I have forgotten. Sorry! However, they both were very, very nice. The bartender made us some delicious Moscow Mules (THANK YOU for putting bitters in them!!), and we ordered the veggie burger and hummus to share. They split our burger for us, which was very gracious of them. The food was delicious, delicious, delicious. It may have been all of the mayo and cheese on the veggie burger that made it so tasty, but who really cares. The burger itself was perfect!   The manager filled us in a bit on some neighborhood problems, and to that I say- THRIVE ON Vig Fillmore, thrive on!! The neighborhood needs you, and they will come to love you!"}
{"text":"Usually love coming here but what a fail today. Under staffed so there's a wait even thought there a plenty of open tables. Then because one person complained, the misters were turned off for the entire patio on a 94 degree afternoon. Extremely disappointing for our coworkers birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Let's just go to The Vig! That may be their slogan, but it's definitely become my standard refrain as well. Since this location is only a five minute walk from my house, it's become a go-to when I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for.  The inside of this location is a bit small, but the patio is huge! Unfortunately, at prime times, it can be hard to find a spot on the patio, and it often seems like they have a ridiculous number of tables that are reserved for people with reservations. It's kind of annoying when you're told certain tables are being held with someone with reservations, but when you finish your meal, those tables are still open. Anyways, I digress.  My favorite part of the Vig is the food and drink selection. I've yet to eat anything here that I didn't like. My favorites are probably the burgers, nachos, and mac & cheese (highly recommend adding chorizo). During brunch, the eggs & enchiladas are definitely fm favorite. The menu has tons of variety overall, and I think most people would be able to find something here they like.  The booze selection is also a winner. Great wine list and a good selection of draft beers. And all wine by the bottle is 1/2 off on Sunday Funday.  Service as a whole is hit or miss. I've had some good servers, some okay ones, and some not so okay ones. The busier they are, the worse service seems to be. Maybe some additional servers would help."}
{"text":"Went here for a Bachelorette Party with 7 girls.  We had a great time! Very good and attentive service.  We split edamame for an appetizer- it was fine, but I take issue with the $7 charge for such a simple and cheap dish. We all got cocktails that were delicious. I had the Westward Ho, which is amazing- lemony and just a touch of sweet. Highly recommend this drink!  had the deconstructed fish tacos for an entrée- very yummy. The fish was cooked perfectly,  the beans were delicious,  and all the other pieces worked nicely together.  2 girls got the mac and cheese and raved about it - I tried a few bites of the mac and cheese with chorizo and it was delicious. Everyone else was very pleased with their food as well. Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here for both Sunday Brunch and dinner during my week long business trip to Phoenix.  Tucked just a few blocks off the beaten path, this is an ideal spot to get away from the normal city dining, maybe even feel at home. You have the option for in or outdoor seating, either way you're going to have good service and great food.  Brunch has your typical bloody mary bar and bottomless mimosas but they have a unique menu with a lot of homemade, freshly sourced ingredients. I tried the corned beef hash with poached eggs. I'll openly admit that for right or wrong, I'm normally a fan of the canned cbh, so this was a dish outside of my comfort zone and I really enjoyed it. The only down side was that the whites of my eggs were a tad undercooked... so when I discovered the gelatin like substance l was done. Luckily I had already ate my fair share.  Although I loved brunch scene, I have to say that I enjoyed dinner a bit more. Our small group sat outside on a mild evening to enjoy some company, beers and dinner. I went pretty basic and got the cheeseburger. As basic as it may be as a choice, it wasn't in flavor. I really enjoyed it as well as the skinny cut fries. They also have a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks last Sat for date night and it's normally a fav of mine but this time I was not impressed at all. Ordered my fav dish-chicken pad Thai and it came out in a soup format! I told my waiter and he didn't offer to fix it. My drink tasted non alcoholic and again the waiter didn't fix it, and it wasn't even busy crazy busy so I can't use that as an excuse... the service wasn't as good as it normally is. Bummer because this was my favorite place so far! I'm so disappointed but maybe it was just bad service this one time. Looking to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch with my niece and her husband. Pleasant atmosphere both inside and out. Very friendly attentive server. The server had food suggestions that we tried. Must say I was quite pleased with our selections.....nachos, turkey sandwich and Lean and Green Salad. On our way out we were admiring the wine case and meant Chris Hardin (the bar manager). Absolutely will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"SARA WAS AWESOMEEEEEWEW SAUCE.. The best waitress EVER..She handled our party like a BOSSS.... Love her next time I come she definitely will be requested.."}
{"text":"Deconstructed tacos were outstanding!!  I ordered them based on my server's claim that it was his favorite item on the whole menu.  He didn't disappoint!!  My companion had nothing but great things to say about his Prime Vig Dip sandwich as well.  A great variety of foods, quality ingredients and wonderfully prepared.  You just can't go wrong with The Vig!  My companion and I were decked out in our D-Backs garb (better to get really good food before the game than so-so food at the game for the same price as the really good food)... he took 20% off our bill!!  That act alone deserves future visits!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the kind of upscale \"casual\" dining spot that you'd expect it to be. It's a popular locale and definitely can get busy after five with people filing in after work. The food is good but it really depends on what you get. We got guac and chips with salsa for the table. It was flavorful and the salsa was delicious but since it is Phoenix, I've definitely had better at a lower price. The Prime Vig Dip was a pretty big disappointment for our table. The beef was over cooked and so chewy it was easier to just take out some of the meat so there would be less chewing. The Maple Glazed Salmon was pretty good, the cut of salmon was cooked well. I personally got the Lean and Green Steak Salad. The presentation for everything was beautiful. The steak salad I got was good, though it could have used more flavors. The balsamic glaze didn't add enough dimension and the cheeses didn't make a big impact. The steak was cooked very well and definitely held up the dish. The cocktails were reasonable though I've had better at a better price so I'd go somewhere else for drinks. All in all, It was good but I don't know if I would come back unless someone actually wanted to go."}
{"text":"The hostess said it would be a 30 min wait when I clearly saw more than 5 options open for 3 people. There was no line in front of behind me from what I can see at either bar. Went to Cibo next instead and got served right away! If you don't feel like for waiting for lines The Vig go to Cibo instead!"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with a  $5 burger and fries on Monday night to kill that case of the Mondays!  Along with many great beers, and top notch service is always on point when we visit the VIG for dinner. The excellent service is one of the main reasons we come in for dinner so often, and the great food of course! Try the jalapeno dip!"}
{"text":"Tonight was very good! I always struggle with having a good experience or food at this location but tonight was on point! I had the appetizer wings and fried chicken sandwich it was delicious and it was hot and tasty! The server/who was the bar tender also was great at checking on us and keeping my water glass full. I was worried about coming to this location but it turned out well."}
{"text":"Cute little place downtown. Great food, lively people, and good patio. Staff is nice and helpful. Indoors is a little small but doable in the heat. I like the steak salad and the chips with guacamole. Love the happy hour deals too."}
{"text":"Not the best experience.  First the valet lot is located behind the restaurant FYI. Not a big deal. There is a huge patio, but that is the predominant seating. Inside the beautifully converted house there really is not a lot of seating. Not great for a dinners in Phoenix during peak summer. The service was great from hosts, but wait staff was non existent. The bartender outside seemed either inconvenienced to take our order, or displeased we were not attractive women. I always tip at least 20%, but this guy had such an attitude and made us wait for no reason that I didn't give home anything Had to flag our waiter down after being seated for ten minutes just to order drinks/food. Then again for drink refills, then again for our check.  The skirt steak I ordered had no flavor whatsoever. The short rib melt was very good. Won't be back at this location. Will stick with uptown location, if ever go to Vig again"}
{"text":"A friend took me here last night. We sat outdoors at the bar. The bartender was friendly and attentive. They have a great beer selection with a lot of craft beers on tap. The menu made it hard to choose dinner. I went with the best turkey sandwich, it included a cranberry chutney, toasted tomatoes, a dill havarti, which now that I've had it I will now crave. The sandwich was on a pretzel bun, which I thought gave it a unique flavor, I feel it wouldn't have been the same with a different bread.  All in all I would absolutely go back next time I am in the area, I highly suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Vig never disappoints.  Was here on Sunday with my softball team for brunch and had the enchiladas.  That sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"We love this place because of the great outdoor setting, service and drinks. Their burger, trifecta and Thai wings are good. The ahi poke is delicous but get it with sauces on the side. The ponzu sauce might be too salty for some people. The pozole is always yummy, just wish it comes steaming hot. The strawberry field is good because the mint made it interesting. The spicy maple glazed salmon is also tasty but I would ask for no chili oil. The oil made the dish very oily and unpleasant."}
{"text":"stopped in on a Sunday afternoon  the place was jammed!  we were advised the wait would be 30 minutes...maybe up to 45.  It wound up being only about 10!  We sat in the bar...server was fantastic.  Very friendly and attentive.  The food was very good!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something to do and ran across this place near ASU... This is the ideal place you go to have some good food, good drinks and a relaxing environment.  Stopped by with my girlfriend and we enjoyed the VigAzz  burger and the Prime Vig Dip.   Again i must reiterate- the environment in itself is worth it..."}
{"text":"Before I moved into the neighborhood I would swear up and down about this place. The food is good and consistent, the staff friendly, and atmosphere lively. My favorite menu items being the calamari, the ono, and steak and sprouts. Now that I frequent it more often, since I live nearby, there are a few flaws (mainly service oriented) that jump out at me. I have repeatedly shown up at the host stand for no one to greet me. Once I sat myself since no one was at the stand. I then waited an additional 10 min as people walked passed me, I gave up and sat at the bar. Today (and other days) I called several times spanning over a few hours to try to put in an order for pickup... No one answered. I gave in and walked over, I went straight to the bar and the bartender, well... She wasn't very approachable. I was going to get a cocktail as I waited but she didn't give me a chance to order it. Oh well. Btw the pozole I ordered (first time having it), the flavor is on point, but it is wayyyy too salty. I will continue to go back because the menu is so convenient and it's nearby."}
{"text":"I held my birthday party there after their Novembeer celebration.  The staff was friendly and helpful in providing us a reserved table so my friends and I had a place to sit down and enjoy the night.  The food was great, the drinks were great and the staff were timely and attentive.  It was an overall beautiful evening celebrating my birthday!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for a farewell celebration for our administrative assistant.  And this place was quite lovely.  The inside of the restaurant was quite tight, with limited seating, but the outside was quite spacious.  They have two nice bars, one in the inside and another outside.  Since it was a lovely day out, we decided to sit outside.  The loo was decently clean, with plenty and I mean plenty of toilet paper to wipe yourself after a nice two.  They had them piled up!  Better to have extra than not enough.  Brilliant strategy.  The server was friendly and attentive but a little slow.  Took them a good 20 minutes to bring out an ice tea.  Which was reported to be really good, and well worth the 20 minutes wait.  The food took quite a while too to come out, about 34 minutes and 11 seconds.  I could be off cause I had to use the loo.  I ordered their wings, an order comes with 10 wings and a few celery sticks.  A little pricy for wings but they were delicious.  They were pump and juicy, and tasted like real chicken.  Definitely high quality stuff here.  Absolutely stunning.  Probably the best wings I had.  Overall a great little restaurant with some pretty good food.  I'll definitely be back!! So have your credit card ready and visit today, don't delay."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - period.  The Vig menu is well known due to the popularity of other locations & I am sure this Vig has the usual reliability.  Historic setting with a sense of depth - check  Very tasteful outdoor seating without a \"parking lot view\" nor horrifically close to 6 lanes of mayhem - check  Bonafide outdoor bar with \"skyline\" views - check  Diverse clientele - check  So - if you are from the east, enjoy \"bars\" & want the benefits of AZ living..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of the four. I've been here numerous times and the service is always great, food is delicious and the crowd and outside area are really what makes me like this location. Get the cheesey tater tots! They're amazing"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last night to get a few happy hour drinks and appetizers. Our server was awesome, and the food was delicious. We just got the guacamole and chips, sweet Thai wings, and the garlic soy edamame, but let me tell you I was satisfied. They all tasted amazing and unique to other restaurants I've been before.  The drinks we had were both different than what I've had before, but they weren't too sweet or overpowering. This place was busy for a Wednesday night in and outside with a range of people. I will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the mimosa and tres leches french toast! And whoever the dj was picked a great selection of songs!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here after work on Thursdays with my colleagues. The happy hour menu is fantastic! but the true gem is TRISTAN, my bartender.  He makes us feel like we are home, as soon as our feet cross the threshold.  He always greets us by name and knows our drink orders.   We are not an easy crowd.   Our drinks are on the table before we finish ordering.  He will make any request, on the menu or not! Tristan makes it happen. Our food order is out after that first sip.  My iced tea stays full And iced. My bff's coke also stays full, no ice! Tristan, thx for helping us relax and feel welcome."}
{"text":"Out of your three locations, this one is my favorite. The chilaquiles are delicious. I really enjoy the atmosphere, huge patio and entertainment."}
{"text":"This is the second Vig restaurant I have tried and I enjoyed both experiences.  This Vig is well situated to downtown yet in a less well traveled area. You shouldn't have to worry about the sound of heavy trucks disturbing your meal.  There are distinct areas where you can be seated to eat. You can sit at the bar and enjoy whatever is on the TVs above the bar. You can sit in the bar where there are a few booths for a sports bar experience. You can also sit outside if the weather is agreeable. You can sit in the restaurant area for a more traditional dining experience.  The menu is not too extensive so it should be easy for you to decide what you want to eat. I ordered a hamburger and a bowl of pozole, the highly recommended chili side. An excellent choice. All the food seems to be very tasty. Their roasted Brussels sprouts are awesome.  They have a full bar and their happy hour is a great deal if you are a wine drinker as you get a 9 ounce pour for the price of a 6 ounce pour.  Try out the Vig and enjoy a fun meal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The food on the other hand was great. Wish I could have given 5 stars maybe if we would have ordered take out. We actually yelped this place before visiting it.  Given an estimate of an hour to be seated... When it was an hour and half checked in with hostess and she replied well that's just an estimate. Actually took 2 hours to be seated and at that it was the waiting area that they cleared and sat us at. Unless your rear was at very edge of bench then you couldn't reach the coffee table to eat which could barely fit our food on. Furniture was bolted down so you couldn't move it closer. So hunching over or eating on your lap was only option. Our waiter tried their best but I feel forgot us many times because like I said this isn't a place they usually serve people. We did arrive at this place about 545pm and there was plenty of room inside but we were told it was reserved for owners party. When we left at 9 those tables still were empty.  To top it off we ordered desserts and one was brought out right away and the other took another 30 minutes to get. By this time we did have a manager come and apologize but it seemed disingenuous and just away to brush us off. She also said the check had been closed out so there was no discount on our bill whatsoever. We did however get a $20 gift card but we aren't coming back and that didn't help the fact we ordered about 10 drinks from bar and 2 appetizers, 7 entrees and 2 desserts.  Wish it would have been a better experience as the ambiance and food seemed top notch.  Wait I almost forgot the best part... The stray cats there was two I believe and one decided to use the restroom next to us."}
{"text":"Brunch menu is fabulous. Awesome Mimosas and bloody Mary's. The lunch menu was a little disappointing when I went back.. this is def a brunch spot. Ambiance is fun n casual.."}
{"text":"\"Visitors Beware\" Appalling service from the Hostess, the so called acting Manager (she was the worse of all). I do my best to avoid writing bad Reviews, but this is a must. In short we were originally told an hour wait, which before you knew it turned into 2 hours. Then when we finally got our table, we sat at a detached area of the Restuarant. It was basically a waiting area with a bolted down coffee table and bench, we literally had to eat on our laps (with a stray Cat roaming around us). I know we all have choices and we should of left, but we were really hoping this place would live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I've ever had. Our party of 8 was accommodated right away at a big table outside with plenty of shade (they gave us an extra umbrella) and greeted with water promptly. Our server (Stephen) took great care of us! He was very speedy and attentive (never let our water glasses go below halfway) and recommended the Corned beef hash to me which I LOVED. yummy chopped hash with hollandaise on poached eggs (my favorite). Best part: bottomless mimosas and $4 bloody Mary's you can make yourself with plenty of options. I also appreciate the manager checking on us and making sure were ok. He gave us a free chocolate mousse/graham cracker merengue dessert when we finished which was just the cherry on top To the perfect brunch. Jazz trio playing outside was a nice touch. If I wasn't on vacation in Phoenix for the week id be frequenting this place for their brunch and cocktails. Thank you to The Vig for creating an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere.  Had the \"Lean & Green Steak Salad\".  You might think that $15.00 is a little pricey for a salad however this was worth every penny.  The flat iron steak was perfectly seasoned, cooked and presented on the salad.  Along with the seasonal vegetables, arugula, red wine vinaigrette, gorgonzola, parmesano, reggiano and aged balsamic this salad was beautiful, tasty, and filling."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after work with an few co workers. The atmosphere and ambiance now very relaxing and chill. The outside is decorated beautifully and is almost like you are having dinner in a luxurious back yard. The food was good, nothing amazing, but great place to have a clean and light dinner. I had the bacon dates as an appetizer, the vanilla tacos for my entree, and the banana pudding for dessert. All very good dishes, but nothing that made the flavor \"pop\" in my mouth. I would come back."}
{"text":"My advice to waiters/waitresses: if you want a good tip, be a good waiter/waitress. This place was pretty busy but if I see my waiter being attentive to all other tables around me except mine that deserves a low tip. He acted like he was super busy but when he got to our order he didnt even let me finish telling him my order. He checked on us once and didn't give eye contact. Other tables he stopped, leaned over on a chair to engage in conversation. The food was great! Steak was a little too rare but everything was fine. Hopefully a better waiter next time."}
{"text":"I went to the Vig Monday night and enjoyed some excellent food and a great atmosphere.  I appreciate that the Fillmore burger is on sale on Mondays after 6pm.  It's a great burger, and I loved it!  It was a little odd that I was charged $1 to have my onions grilled. The atmosphere is great, but the music is a bit too loud and I couldn't hear people across the table from me. I recommend the Vig for the tasty food and the nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pallet, Local Breeze, and now The Vig Fillmore.  I hope it is a done deal.  I always loved their open spacious patio.  I arrived for a birthday dinner.  They have an amazing Happy Hour so took advantage of that. The $5 flatbread pizza with goat cheese was so delicious."}
{"text":"Overall, I give them 4/5 stars because they aren't top tier and the mimosas seem to get drowned by OJ 50% of the time but the service, environment, and food are ultimately impressive. I always have a good time here. No dissatisfaction with the food, as of yet. We always enjoy the food. The bottomless mimosas are $15 and this price should be lowered, in my opinion. But other than that, it's a stand up place that offers comparable prices with other restaurants nearby. The servers always provide great service, the food is always great (especially the sweet potato fries and Thai chili wings), and the environment provides a decent mid 20s to 30s crowd of decent human beings that you are likely to get into a conversation with. Not to mention, the pleasant live music provided on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and delicious food. If you're looking for a place to have cocktails and great food with friends or even just dinner with your the family I recommend this place. The food is great, the best posole I've ever ate also the shredded pork nachos."}
{"text":"The Vig, no matter which location, is consistently good in my books.  This review is to thank Ryan, Megan and the wait staff for hosting a wonderful event we put on for our daughter's 21st birthday.  Ryan was great to work with during initial planning.  Megan locked in all the details prior and was awesome to work with.  She even created personalized menus with our daughter's name on them, and the items we wanted available to her 21 friends.  We were waited on like VIPs the entire evening.  Apps, entrees, drinks, all came out fast and correct.  That is quite a feat given the # of people.  We were even allowed to store cake and cupcakes in their fridge.  If you are looking for a great venue to host an event...Vig Fillmore should be at the top of your list!  Thanks again everyone!!"}
{"text":"Loved that Thai wings! Great snack at the bar while we were at happy hour watching baseball. I ordered the Bennett bubbles cocktail and hubby ordered his gin and tonic and we were golden. Very good service from Candace. Will be a good HH go to spot."}
{"text":"This used to be the go-to place for me and a large group of my friends who get together regularly for happy hour after work - the chips and guacamole are amazing, the kale dip is to die for, and the sliders and hummus come in as a close second. However, over the past few months, the prices on happy hour have gone up to the point that they are pretty much regular prices, the hummus platter has been changed and is much less shareable, and the kale dip is no longer even on the happy hour menu. We have started going to other spots for our get togethers but wanted to visit the Vig again this evening - we made a reservation for 10, which is the size of our usual group and we usually make a reservation. However, when the first few folks arrived, we were told we could not take the table - NOT because it was too busy, but because it was too INCONVENIENT for them to serve us as we arrived. Instead, we were forced to sit at the bar RIGHT NEXT to our table that remained empty for 30 minutes as our party arrived - we have never been treated this way before, and I doubt we will return. This used to be a fun, casual place with great food and drinks for a great price.  The prices and the atmosphere are no longer good. It is very disappointing."}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore is an outstanding place for brunch, lunch, dinner or a party with a dozen or two of your close friends.  Last night we celebrated my husband's birthday and The Vig continued to out do our expectations.  Jenna was very helpful during dinner and Wes was amazing with all of our guests the whole night on the patio.  It was warm in spite of the temps due to the skillfully placed heaters and we never went wanting for a beverage."}
{"text":"Love their guacamole here. Delicious. The portions are very generous for the price. This place is definitely happening. It seems like a lot of the local professionals come mingle here after work. Come see and be seen here. Great and fast service."}
{"text":"Honestly there was nothing that stuck out to me as great during my meal. I got the pad Thai and it wasn't very good. Too much of everything except noodles and way too much sauce. Bummed, wanted to like this place. I liked the atmosphere but just didn't have a good meal."}
{"text":"Love it been here twice since I moved to Phoenix best broccoli in town and huge EdamamE portions boyfriend loved the burgers andnfriends have raved about it as well will return over and over"}
{"text":"The service was amazing, the brunch was so yummy! The outdoor misty patio was perfect for this hot Saturday."}
{"text":"So, I had The Vig bookmarked for almost 2 years and I was very upset with myself after my 1st time here that it took me so long to get my booty in this establishment!! I loved it. I went total gluttony overboard and I have ZERO regrets. Edamame was fantastic. Their cheesy tator tots that tasted like God hand rolled them himself were a flavor party in my mouth with every delicious savory both (slight drooling happening), we had the whitefish special and killed that in about 3.5 minutes. My boo had the short rib tacos as well...he murdered those as well...no remaining meat was found anywhere. We also had shrimp pad Thai and the mac& cheese. Yes , this was ALL consumed among two ppl. We finished  everything besides the two pastas which we took home and thoroughly enjoyed the next day. Craft beers, and cocktail drinks were happily consumed as well.  The food is of really good quality here. I left feeling full but not the run down I need a nap bcus I cant move full. I was rlly happy with this restaurant and I will be back in the near future...the menu does change as well!!  p.s great service!"}
{"text":"Historically, I have loved this restaurant. They have great GF options and a Monday night burger deal that's top notch. However, service just keeps getting worse. Tonight, I sat at the bar for almost 5 minutes ( with only 4 other people at the bar) and none of the 4 bartenders/ bar backs said anything to me. They made eye contact and looked away, instead of letting me know it would be just a minute or handing me a glass of water while I waited. It was more important to talk to each other  about their weekend plans and about how angry they were that all the beers were *86 ed. Hey Vig, I want to be your customer. It doesn't take much, a smile, a wave, and a little customer service."}
{"text":"I came to the Vig Fillmore on a Wednesday night before attending a concert downtown with friends. It looked like there was an event going on, but that didn't stop or limit the great service I received sitting on the patio. I believe our servers name was Alex, she had great recommendations for food and drinks on the menu as it was most of our first time at The Vig.  Overall the experience was 10/10, we definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Heard the mac and cheese was out of this world, so I was super excited to finally check it out. While it was good, it wasn't better than a lot of other places. We shared the jalapeño artichoke dip, it was definitely edible, but again nothing I would go back for. I wasn't that much of a fan of the environment. The drinking was definitely not being monitored by bar and serving staff the way it should have been, saw a guy literally fall out on the ground from being drunk. Glad I had the experience so that I wouldn't wonder, but it's not really somewhere I'd go out of my way to go back to."}
{"text":"I always love the atmosphere at The Vig... They have great food, great music, delish wine choices and my friends and I always have a great time here..."}
{"text":"I love this place. K had her work Christmas party here. Our server was Chad. He was awesome. The party was out on the patio. There were plenty of heatlamps in use so all in all it was fairly pleasant.  For the party goers there was Guacamole, Mini Burgers and Bruschetta. There might have been other food that was gone before we got there. Of the food we got to taste, the Guacamole was amazingly good. Spicy, but good. The little burgers were fine as well.   Beautiful Patio. Great Service. Good Food. Fair Prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I am revising my score up to 2 stars because The Vig management did send me a message which I was very impressed with. They took responsibility and apologized for each point that I had mentioned and shared specific steps they have taken to prevent something similar happening. He said they have moved the 'add chicken' button to a separate place from the 'side of chicken' button. They reviewed my pictures with their team of cooks and were looking at the dressing that they make for this salad.   He also offered to treat me for a second visit to give them a chance to redeem themselves. I didn't feel comfortable accepting the free meal, because that is not why I yelp, but I will however, go back sometime and give them a second chance and I will update my review again at that time. Everyone has bad days, but how you respond to failure says a lot. If I were giving stars for the response, it would be 5 stars and with that kind of leadership, I have no doubt that they will do well."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot! I enjoy coming to the vig for lunch. My favorite bites are the posole, wings, and you can't beat their pork nachos. When coming here for happy hour, make sure you get the edamame to snack on! This is everyone's favorite spot to sit back, relax, enjoy good food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The Vig always satisfies. Nachos, trifecta, carne asada on a potato pancake. Yes, yes and yes! The inside is small and I would describe it as Restoration Hardware if Restoration Hardware was a bar. Great portrait of Fillmore on the wall! Great ambiance. But, this Vig is my favorite because of it's outdoor space. Full bar outside and plenty of lawn games. Great spot to enjoy the weather when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Had the Trifecta sliders and fries, and they were great. Sweet potato fries are awesome. Servers are prompt and attentive and friendly.  I will be back.  Little bit high for sliders at $11, but still reasonable.  We were outside with old school hip hop music. laid back atmosphere, a 20-30 something crowd, mostly."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese is the Best! Never had anything I didn't like here but when you crave the Mac and Cheese on your way into the office ..... you know it's good. Happy Mac and Chezzing!"}
{"text":"Two words... Happy. Hour. This place has a great one. I went last night with my dad, step mom, and husband and we all ate including a dessert for 30$. Amazing! We got the sliders (5$), the flatbread (5$), and the fish tacos (5$). They also had other items that were less expensive like dips and breads and whatnot that were 3-4$, but we didn't try those. Aaanyway, the flatbread of the day was a roasted tomatillo, roasted garlic, cheddar, mozz, and sausage... ohh soooo good. The roasted veg was awesome. I kind of loved it. It was pretty large as well. The sliders (3) came with a big pile of fries and were also quite large. They were very tasty and the bun was especially good and flavorful... which you don't typically find on a slider. The fish tacos (4) were also large and just a little spicy, they came with a really good tomatillo salsa. For dessert we got a brownie to share at the waiter's recommendation, but this was my least favorite part of the meal. The brownie was absolutely flavorless... what a waste of calories.  Although I don't think I would recommend the brownie, I will certainly be back for happy hour!  PS Like its predecessor Local Breeze, this place has a great patio, large and pretty with a bocce ball court! Alright!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I dislike more than being told there is a 20-45 minute wait only to see 10-15 empty tables. Happened today at this location. We asked for indoor or outdoor. There were 4 of us. We were sat at a table for 6 and there were several tables that sat 4 outside. Inside was also noisy. The attitude if the hostess was nasty probably due to all the people waiting fir the empty tables. One positive note the food was good, service could have been better."}
{"text":"Great food/drinks and atmosphere, unfortunately we had a crappy server with an attitude like he didn't want to be there and was never around."}
{"text":"We had a large group of ladies for a bridal dinner, Nina was our server to start, she was super upbeat and accommodating,  even after we switched sections for a bigger table, she still was very friendly towards us. Very professional. Our server that served us after was incredibly attentive, he even split the checks for our large party. Food was delicious, and the patio was very nice."}
{"text":"I come here all the time.  I don't check in all the time (which I should) but it's delicious here.  Day or night the menu choices are classic and of course I have a few personal favorites.   Suggestions would be garlic edamame, fish tacos, pozole, and the Mac and cheese with chicken and broccoli.  The outdoor setting is comfortable and the staff has always been super nice and wonderful.  They also have free WiFi and sometimes it's nice to sit in a chair with a glass of wine and I can sit and use my tablet or read. I will always be back and chilling because who can deny a mac n cheese craving?"}
{"text":"Great food! Great host! Great waitresses! Over all great customer service. Definitely going back there!"}
{"text":"The Vig never disappoints! The food and drinks are great and the ambiance is even better. We opt to sit outside everytime: misters, TV's and cornhole!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome patio, and the indoor seating looked really nice as well. My friend and I both ordered the flat iron steak with chimichurri. I thought the steak and chimichurri had wonderful flavor and the french fries were really tasty as well. My only complaint is that the steak is a bit hard to cut and to chew. We ordered the pork belly and watermelon appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised by the unique combination of flavors. The pork belly was great and had a lot more meat to it than some pork belly I have had in the past."}
{"text":"Best new downtown joint for sure. This place is great for all sessions. The brunch is delicious. Lunch and dinner are on point. The patio is amazing. I am curious to see what it is going to be like in the dead of summer. Might be a bit too hot to hangout there unless they have a nice misting system with some large swamp coolers hanging out.   This place is our first go to for going out on a Friday or Saturday night. Great vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Under the heading \"It could have been handled better\", we stopped by after Masters of Movement downtown last Friday. We had my 15 year old daughter with us. It was after 9pm. Apparently they have a rule that no one under 21 gets in after 8pm(is this City of Phoenix mandated?). In any case, the maitre d'(or bouncer or resident whatever) stonewalled us as if we were attempting to sneak into a back alley nightclub with fake ids. No smile, no explanation, no \"come back and see us before 8pm\". I thought this was supposed to be friendly neighborhood restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Top Notch. We love the Vig. Excellent happy hour. Awesome menu selections. We love all the locations. Highly recommend this place. They have cornhole/bags and a nice outdoor space at all of their locations. Trendy, Hipster, great spot. Service is excellent all the time."}
{"text":"While I'm not impressed with the updates they made to the building itself (an old house that Local Breeze - former inhabitants - kept looking awesome), the vibe is still pretty chill and there's lots of outdoor space. The inside space is not so bueno. I typically ride my bike here, but my most recent trip was via light rail stop at Roosevelt with one of my most favorite people in the world... and it wasn't too bad of a walk through some older/cute neighborhoods.   The food here has been great every time I've been. I've had several items on the menu and each has been well executed and brought out in a timely fashion. This last trip I had the Best Turkey sandwich and I'd definitely get that again. I typically get their salads and all of them are YUMMY!   Clientele is typical of DT PHX for the most part, although in the later brunching hours it seems to change a bit - into a younger/hungover crowd. But there's plenty of outdoor space to be off in your own corner enjoying our awesome PHX weather year-round."}
{"text":"I went to The Vig with some co-workers. The place was packed, yet we were served right away. The French Dip was yummy and the fries very crispy and tasty. Drinks looked good, but it was a school night so no alcohol for me. After we were finished eating we sat around chatting and they didn't seem to mind. Overall, a great plave. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not a bad time at all, great location too. everything was pretty good except the manhattan and they could add a few more Irish whiskeys to the menu. Good atmosphere and I like the idea of being able to play bocci while drinking."}
{"text":"My first time here and a tad disappointed. I know it was a Friday night, but the service was slow. We were at a makeshift table overlooking a window that was tucked away from the normal traffic, so we ended up going to bar to get our drinks refills. Maybe that's the norm here, I'm not sure. When our food came out we did not have silverware, again maybe the casual atmosphere is set up so you need to request it (to multiple people). Our server was very nice, she appeared to be rushing so maybe they were short servers. As for the food, it was ok. My macaroni and cheese was dried out, as if it was forgotten in the oven. Since it was my first time, I will give it another try, but not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Atmosphere is awesome - both the patio and inside of the restaurant are unique and beautiful. The place makes me want to drink (in a good way), they have totally set the tone with lighting and ambiance. Service was great all around.  But the food was just sort of \"meh\". We had the bacon wrapped dates (good, but very small for the $8 or $9 they are charging). I had a steak salad, pretty standard but satisfying (in no way crave-able though). My husband had the Vigazz burger, which was cooked perfectly, but was disappointed it didn't come on a pretzel bun like it does at the uptown location (he says the bun really sets it apart). Another in our party had the greek salad and it looked like a salad you would get at the airport in one of those to-go stands.  The table next to us had the nachos, which looked and smelled wonderful. So I am guessing their menu is hit and miss."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Phoenix restaurants. Our server Jeremiah was wonderful and he had amazing suggestions on beers (that were off the menu). The best guac I've had in a long time, overall a fantastic experience and would recommend for everyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"The Vig is my favorite downtown spot. The area is different that the other Vigs'  around the valley. Its in a neighborhood community, the home was turned into a restaurant. Parking however is difficult. The outside space with the yard is nice and huge with corn hole games.   You're greeted as soon as you arrive. I would recommend making a reservation for larger parties & ask to have the checks split before hand. It took an hour to get out bill figured out on my birthday night. I have also gone with a small groups.   The best item on the menu is \"The Best Turkey Sandwich\"! Its Thanksgiving in your mouth! The Mac'N'Chz with the add-ins and fish tacos were amazing as well. My son loves the kids menu! So good for kids. The cocktails are delicious & refreshing. I personally like sitting at the bar to see the drinks being made.  Best Sunday Funday spot with bottomless mimosas and a live DJ outside. It gets busy so get there early for a table.   A+ spot! Good food! Good staff! Great area! I'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of ten for their Novem-beer event.  I was nicely impressed with their customer service.  Our table on the patio was all set up when we arrived.  And they surrounded the area with heaters, so even though it was a cold and drizzly day, everyone felt pretty comfortable.  The Novem-beer event itself was fun, a good value for what you paid because you got to sample a lot of drinks.  Plus, they were supposed to punch your card every time you got a sample, but lots of times they didn't punch my card, so if I had wanted to, I could've gotten way more than ten samples (but I didn't.... I'm a light weight).  The service got slower when it got really packed, but we were fine with waiting since we were there to hang out and chat anyway.  Like the other Vig location, their food doesn't super impress me, but it's good enough to come back again."}
{"text":"Ambiance is fabulous, beautiful old house with a fabulous patio. The food was not so great. I ordered my black and bleu burger medium and was promised that it would have pink in the middle. It was cooked all the way through and terribly dry. Couldn't find the bleu cheese or the bbq sauce.  The side of roasted sweet potatoes was great as were the onion rings my partner had. The waitress was slow and unattentive. I was so disappointed and most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Out of all the Vigs this one is my favorite! I love the outside part.  The food and service has been consistently fantastic every time I've been. I can't really recommend any one thing because everything has been delicious and I'd have them all again!"}
{"text":"I've been and go to the Vig Fillmore on different occasions.   This restaurant was great at hosting our wedding rehearsal dinner. They sat our family and friends outside on the patio. Food was served buffet style and we were able to pick out 5 different menu items for our guests to enjoy. When it came to alcohol/beer, the servers were on top of making sure we got drinks. All in all, they made sure we were being taken care of on one of our biggest days.   They also have a great brunch menu. Bottomless mimosas are $15.00! You can't go wrong with that.   Dinner menu is great. I feel like every time I come here I have to try every dish. The Hot Vings are my favorite. I like to get half traditional and half thai sweet chili. Another appetizer I do enjoy are the cheesy tator tots. They are basically these huge tator tots stuff with cheesy goodness.   My other favorite dinner dishes are: Big bowl of Posole, the Prime Vig Dip, Fillmore Burger, and the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for dinner before going to a show on a Sunday night. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of wait and immediately got a table inside. I have an autoimmune disorder with an accompanying list of food sensitivities that makes me really self conscious about eating out because I hate being \"difficult\". Our server was SO nice about my list and went and consulted with the chef about the ingredients of some of the salad dressings then suggested two that would pair well with the salad I wanted. I ended up with the Strawberry Fields salad with the red wine vinaigrette and it was so so good. My friend got the steak salad and charred broccoli and loved them both. Just an all around wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I went today because mondays after 6 the classic burger and fries is only $6. This beats fast food deals and it's so delicious. This is the second time I've gone and today the service was exceptional! Love the food and TODAYS service"}
{"text":"The Vig Fillmore has become my go-to Vig location, just because it's closest to me.  The hostess situation can be confusing if you're coming from the valet-side of the building.  But like the other Vig locations, the food and drinks are consistently good.  They also have a great and large outdoor patio and bar.  The outdoor area is actually larger than the interior seating spaces."}
{"text":"Just a relaxing, outdoor, friendly place. Attentive staff and management. Great drink specials. The best outdoor seating downtown in my opinion. My go to place.  Try the deconstructed tacos."}
{"text":"Poor service, the lady took a while to get to us along with all of her other tables. Also one of the employees asked a table if they could sample a reserve bottle of wine that they bought because he didn't even know they had that one & had never tried it before. Not only was he on the job trying wine at the table with the guest, he took the FIRST POUR. Wow. I don't know if he was the manager or owner but still that isn't right to me & especially in front of other customers as well. Totally unprofessional, are you able to go up to your tables & ask them for a sample of their wine whether it's reserve or not? Really odd to me. Also the appetizers were only a few dollars cheaper than our entrees, it was just a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this is near my home. I love the menu and it's always a slam dunk delivery.  The Vigazz Burger is no joke and I'm always drinking the Jameson Mule. Yummmm! Just found out they have live music outside and the entertainment has been top notch. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place! While I was sad to see Local Breeze go, I love with Fig (what I lovingly refer to it as) has done with the place! The atmosphere is great, staff is all super friendly, and I love the menu!   I somehow always end up getting the ceviche with a side of tortillas, BAM, ceviche tacos! Nachos are tasty, all of their sandwiches too. Good selection of beer on tap. Wine is 50% off on Sunday too!"}
{"text":"My favourite venue in Phoenix!! I ate there three times. The most amazing patio and brunch non Sundays!! $3 mimosas or $4 Titos Bloody Mary's. The staff where what really made the place and the food is why I kept going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun atmosphere, delicious food. A bit pricey but average for downtown Phoenix. Free valet!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Stopped in with some friends on a Monday night for dinner. Had the $5 burger special with sweet potato fries.  I don't know if they were understaffed or slammed but service was slow. Our server was really nice when we saw him but it took forever to order and/or receive anything.  For $5, it was a great burger. Would I want to pay $12? No... But the sweet potato fries were great (as were the regular fries).  Seating is very nice, and the heat lamps definitely keep you warm. I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix. The food, service and drinks are AMAZING! It's a great place to hang out with friends or family to come and have just have a great time. The staff is always available, great customer services and the food is just awesome but the fast service in getting your food is just great. It's fresh and well worth the cost. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Very attractive restaurant and patio, well-trained staff and great food made for a nice evening. We enjoyed the Monday $5 burger and fries - delicious flavor and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Totally unprofessional service. Another example of downtown dining standards going downhill"}
{"text":"Went here and had their Mac and cheese.  It wasn't the most amazing Mac and cheese I've ever had but it was good, and I also tried a black bean burger with fries.  The black bean burger and fries was delicious.  Service and atmosphere was fantastic.  I will definitely go back to try other things."}
{"text":"The classic cheeseburger is one of my favorite burgers ever! And the patio is amazing but everyone already knows that. However, the bartenders are 10/10 times, a-holes. So, I try to stay away."}
{"text":"Complimentary valet. Food is great. Atmosphere is friendly and clean. Staff and service can be slow and unresponsive. If they can fix this, it would be perfect.  Usually get the hummus trio starter and ahi salad. Pad thai is also very good."}
{"text":"Came in to celebrate my birthday with the family with no reservations. We were created and seated right away. We ordered the nachos with chicken to start with and were not disappointed. The nachos were perfectly proportioned and savory. The chicken was not dry at all. Our waitress also waited patiently enough to take our orders. Once we were ready to order, our food came out as we wrapped up our appetizer. Our table ordered two orders of the hot wings (sweet chili, regular), two orders of chicken fried sandwich and one The Vig burger. All of the food was great, warm and perfect. The servings are pretty big and enough to share. Next time I'll split a burger. I was also surprised with a nice chocolate cake with ice cream. The staff was very nice to acknowledge my bday on the way out. The service was amazing. Can't wait to come back for happy hours."}
{"text":"So the food is \"the vig food\"... very good!  The problem with this location (hopefully) is that it just opened.  The service was not very good.  What this place needs is a couple months to work out the kinks... then it will probably be as good as the others.  Now I see why the ratings are lower at this place."}
{"text":"We've been here a lot.  The service is pretty good and the food is excellent. The wait time for a table is long because they don't take reservations.  Sit in or out. Watch sports in the many large screens around the bar.   Good for groups.  Neat cocktail selections.  I gravitate towards the wines.   I normally order the roasted beet salad.  Some, depending on the day, it looks different.    The portions are huge and priced well.   If you come for Sunday brunch, be prepared to wait a while.  Order smsime $2.00 mimosas at the bar while you wait.  Folks seem to like the macaroni. It's a very popular dish.    Some days, they have live music. Usually chill guitar. The bathrooms are clean.  Park on the street."}
{"text":"Met some of my yogini friends down here for brunch.  Rode the light rail and had a nice seat on the patio.   I had a great mimosa or two and some yummy food.  It was nice and I had a good time."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for a table after being told it would only be 30 min. We were finally notified our table was ready but, when we went to the hostess, she told us there was a mistake and we'd have to wait an other 15 min. Unfortunately we had prior plans that made it impossible to wait any longer. I don't mind waiting but, I don't like being lied to."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on Super Bowl Sunday. We wanted to eat outdoors but they were to busy to accommodate us out there. We settle for indoor seating.   The food was great and our server was awesome. Cute establishment to have brunch at. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. This place is GORGEOUS! And so fun! I had mimosas and the short rib tacos! These tacos are delicious annnnndddd they are filling. I struggled to finish. The staff was really nice and managed to take care of us despite being busy! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped into The Vig for a spare of the moment Valentine's Day dinner. We thought the Vig would be the perfect place for a group of 5 and only one couple. All I can say is \"meh.\"  First, they weren't preparing the full menu. The hostess sat down the menu but never said this. Then  the waitress comes. Beautiful black young lady, just to add. She explains that it is Valentines, the kitchen was having Valentines dinners, and then decide to only continue making tapas. -_- ugh, here we go.  So we ordered 2 hot chicks, 2 mac and cheese, 3 tacos, and sliders. NO modifications. This also doesn't sound like a difficult order right?  (SIDENOTE: there was a table of two here prior to our sitting down, a table of two that were sat after we were seated.) About 45 mins go by he we hadn't got our food. BUT the aforementioned two tables, had.  A member of our table got up to inquire about the order, it came out minutes later.   THE FOOD WAS COLD. Ugh . Annoying. You made me wait that long? Then everything didn't come out at the same time?   A guest came shortly after. Ordered a drink and 4 shots, took about 10 mins for those to come.  The shots were strong. That's why the rating is three stars.  Tonight was a let down forreal. I've been here multiple times, and multiple times to other locations. Sub par food, for really no reason because it isn't even busy. Consistency. The only thing I ask for, in all areas of my life."}
{"text":"Very poor service. One person in our party didn't get their appetizer, another two ordered coffee with creamer and the coffee was brought but the creamer was completely forgotten about. Waiter didn't place all the orders for our table. When called on it, had the order brought by a waitress so he didn't have to bring it to the table (it was in plain sight that he handed off the dish to the waitress). Food that was brought was incorrect. Al was the name of the waiter. Make sure you ask for someone who has a little more experience waiting on tables."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, and drinks are great. Can't go wrong with $5 burgers every Monday. Ask for Mario, he's such an awesome server. Very attentive and friendly! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great burger awesome Thai chicken wings and a free birthday dessert. The hummus was good as well with cucumbers and tomatoes. Love the food here"}
