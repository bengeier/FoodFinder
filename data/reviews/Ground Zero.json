{"text":"Solid cup of coffee and nice atmosphere in a great neighborhood.   I've had the cafe mocha and cafe au lait and recommend either. The coffee is full flavored and not burned like Starbucks.   Comfy couches and pleasantly decorated with eclectic collections of maps and cameras. Nice place to study. Ample parking in a neighborhood where that's not common."}
{"text":"stopped here for some studying, so i was looking for a solid cup of coffee that would keep me going. what i got: watery \"coffee\" that didn't taste good or give me that buzz i was looking for. meh at best for the product, but the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere awesome coffee. I often meet clients here for meetings because it's a pretty condusive place to have a coffee and do a little work. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Good coffee for a very reasonable price. Clean little establishment with generous employees. Drink local! Havn't had their food, so that docks them a star, but that might change soon!"}
{"text":"Ground Zero was the first coffee shop I visited after moving to Madison, and it's still a favorite to this day.  While there are probably more funky and electic alternatives, Ground Zero is a bright, solid choice for lingering over a Sunday paper, studying, or browsing through one of the many Dwell magazines inhabiting the space.  Choose from hot coffee and tea drinks or something cold from the cooler to go along with pastries and sandwiches and soups made to order.  Given its location, Ground Zero is popular with Willy Street area residents, grad students, and others of the \"mature\" crowd--weekends can be challenging to find a table amongst the laptop crowd tapping the free wi-fi.  Parking is plentiful in the building lot or on Williamson St.  One of the only knocks is the hours--closes at 9pm on weekdays and 10pm on Friday and Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison a long time and never really noticed how awesome Ground Zero is. Their sammiches are damn tasty and really cheap too. Usually at a coffee shop the sammiches are dry and boring and flavorless, but Ground Zero has great lunch options. Not to mention, really really good coffee."}
{"text":"Good coffee and a cool setup inside. The quality of the drinks seems vary depending who's making them, but they're more than happy to make you a new one if you aren't pleased with it."}
{"text":"One of the best all around coffee houses in Madison. If you need a place to chill in Madison this is it. A warm, clean, beautiful coffee house with great drinks, food, and music. Extremely approachable baristas and ambiance, this place is good for both drinks to go and to stay. Wifi, good couches, local pride and a modern vibe without being too sterile. This is the place for real people.  I'd recommend the tuna, the chai and brewed coffee.  There's a parking lot too, so be aware around rush hour!  Best overall coffee house."}
{"text":"Brought to you by the people who brought you Cargo Coffee, Ground Zero gives a cozy, warm, coffee-sipping and catching up on some work kind of feel. There were ample tables, sunlight, and most people who were here had laptops and perched out. Despite all of the people inside, the space was remarkably quiet, but not in a bad way.   The cafe au lait was tasty and I grabbed a day old bagel, both of which totaled out to be at an extremely reasonable price. I liked how I was handed a cup of steamed milk and got to fill my own cup with coffee as to have a preferred milk to coffee ratio.  I'll most definitely come back in the future, and this is a lovely gem that fits right into the Willy St community. It isn't a super standout must-visit coffee shop in Madison, but it's a solid, local choice."}
{"text":"Recently found this gem on the the hippy Willy St. Being able to venture out of the UW campus and seeing a different scenery is just what I needed! The coffee shop has great ambiance; I love the maps and the globes in the shop as well as other post WWII decors. As for coffee, lattes are decent. I'm here more for the ambiance than the coffee. Tables are slightly smaller if you are the type that like to spread out. Oh, another plus, plenty parking available."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes. From the minute you walk in, the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, like someone giving you a warm hug.  I loved all of the decor, especially the maps.    I ordered one of their specials (a different take on a lemonade) and chilled with my BF on the sofas in the back of the cafe.  It was a nice place to relax and talk and occasionally watch other people doing the same, or work. Overall, awesome way to spend the afternoon."}
{"text":"Great for coffee and lunch! Their sandwiches are fresh and tasty worth a stop! Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. I have enjoyed the Rwanda coffee medium roast. If you ask, they have a description list for all of their coffees at the counter."}
{"text":"Ground Zero is the sister coffee shop to Cargo Coffee on Park St.  Both make good espresso drinks and have standard pastry selections.  The drip coffee is so-so, though it's nice you can order an 8oz cup as well as other sizes. Very 1950s coffee set. (Maybe not a coincidence? I'm a fan of any coffee shop like this that has the nerve to decorate in \"post WWII cold war bunker\".)  There is good wifi, almost always parking in the lot, and a cool renovated historic building that's shared with El Dorado Grill. Advice: get an iced latte in the summer.  It will last exactly the walk from Ground Zero down to St Vinnys for vintage/thrift shopping."}
{"text":"Other than the high turnover of staff and their inability to successfully take a coffee order, Ground Zero is the place to go for the Atomic Brew coffee that will blast you off to another planet.  Tasty baked goods from La Brioche.  Hip location on Willy Street in the Old Madison Candy Factory (Registered Historical Building). Free wireless. Big store front window that gives a nice open view and let's the sun shine in!"}
{"text":"Great place for studying.  Awesome coffee combos!  Parking is a challenge, but worth finding a spot.  Haven't had food there yet, but my latte rocked."}
{"text":"Fantastic space, decorated with plenty of natural light and vintage maps. Great seasonal drink menu and extremely friendly staff. I was in town for the weekend and this was the only coffee shop I could find in Madison that opens before 7am on Saturday."}
{"text":"I am a fan of their coffee, fun space, and long standing history of quality service.  I visited this shop over 12 years ago, not much has changed and that's just fine by me. Vintage maps and a old school feel, looks just right on Willy Street gives off a good vibe.  The place is usually quite full, so hard to grab a spot in the colder months.   Love that they place some tables out front in the summer.   Bonus: Parking lot right next to building. Minus: It's too quite for a conversation or a loud mouth like me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out and study. Also right next to incredible food - check out the grill next door for brunch.  Ground zero has their own parking lot and also plenty of street parking in front because they're not quite in the heart of willy street yet. There are some weird time limits on the parking lot and other signs that have been recently instated, so keep an eye out for those lawmakers.  Inside there is plenty of seating and plenty of outlets, and a couch in the back. There's a good mix of normal people eating (their deli sandwich on a croissant is amazingly really good) as well as people doing work, so there's a nice low level buzz to the place."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop!  I love the building and love the windows that let in a lot of light.  Parking lot, too.  Good coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty solid cafe for working in the afternoons especially as you get good light coming in for most of the seating areas. Wi-fi is generally solid and seats are fairly available with a decent number of outlets around if you need them. If you like dark blends the atomic blend is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Nice, typical coffee shop in the south side of the Marquette neighborhood. Very large sitting space inside with minimal outside seating (about 4 chairs between 2 small tables). Large windows inside looking out on Williamson at the front of the building are great for feeling the city vibe if that's what you're into; back of the building keeps the homey feel with couches and smaller, house-like windows. Vintage maps and canvas art on the walls combined with the short cut and blue dyed hairstyles of the baristas give the place its overall hipster feel. This review brought to you by free, unlocked wifi (although my iPhone wouldn't connect to the 5G for some reason...the 2.4G seems to be doing just fine though).  It's never very busy in here. Today I had to wait behind a group of 10 or so out of town teenagers, which was rough. I only had an iced coffee and bagel though, and the baristas got it out to me fast. Praise.  They have a good variety of reserve coffees to choose from, as well as a small selection of sandwich items (which you can also have on a bagel or croissant). Espresso options, too, though these are also limited - a mocha latte is about as frufru as the Starbucks regulars are going to be able to get.  Overall, pretty typical for Madison. The biggest plus is the size of the cafe inside; the worst is probably the selection of food items. Neither of these are make or break, though, so Ground Zero if definitely worth the try if your looking for a good representation of a Madison neighborhood coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Food is okay (their wraps are fairly tasty), coffee is okay, and hours are limited (closes too early for the night owl in more). But there are lots of tables, plugs, and they don't play their music too loud. Not a bad alternative for getting work done during the daytime hours."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful chai with oat milk here the other day. It's one of the few coffee shops in Madison (especially in the Willy St area) that has parking. The price was very reasonable (3.75 for 12 oz before the addition of oat milk) and the decor is cute- love all the maps! Very friendly staff, will definitely return."}
{"text":"The coffee is good and the treats are always delicious.  The staff is super friendly as well.  There is lots of room to sit and chat usually.   The atmosphere is such that you can sit and chat with friends without having people glare from behind laptops.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is bright, sunny, and I've never been driven out by awful music. The internet is reliable.   The coffee is good, the tea selection is great, and the staff are very friendly.   My only complaint is a relative scarcity of wall plugs."}
{"text":"Come here often for client meetings or to just hang out and work. Love the ambiance - an eclectic mix of antique maps, cameras and radios create a groovy, WWII-ish feel. Wood floors, funky tables and chairs, and the historic building make it cozy. Friendly staff, good food and drink. Locally owned. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"This was rated one of the best coffee shops in the Madison area, and I can see why. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but the smell of all the different roasts they had was almost enough to convert me :-) We had some really tasty sandwiches for lunch.The place was really quiet - a bunch of people alone on their laptops, but it was still a friendly atmosphere. Very eclectic decorations, a nice amount of tables, and a couple couches."}
{"text":"Great coffee place on Willy St. I went here often since I lived right by it. Loved their mochas and the large, vintage maps on the walls. Food was decent, and the staff was nice. They didn't have the most wall outlets for when I was studying, but my roommate and I survived."}
{"text":"Great coffee house! Good coffee, tasty sandwiches, very friendly staff (who lack that exhausting pretentious aura that too many Willy Street establishments ooze), comfortable chairs, decent-sized tables and a great, sunny atmosphere. The internet is fast and there are a decent number of outlets as long as you have a longish cord."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Their House Blend was ok, but their Costa Rica blend was excellent. Great vibes at this place."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good atmosphere! And parking! And my morning bun was delicious."}
{"text":"In spite of reference to Hiroshima, WWII planes everywhere, and being a monument to the military, its ok."}
{"text":"My first time here was last Sunday, and I kept on having to pull out my shazam app to find out what song I was listening to because I had to have it.  I had just so happened to have forgotten my headphones at home, so I was deeply grateful for the snazzy beats that were gettin' my head bobbin'.  Today is yet another Sunday, and it is much busier than it was last week, but there was dang near a blizzard last Sunday, so I think that this will be more of the normal flow of things.  I have only had their coffee, but I am someone who likes to try out different sweeteners and whatnot.  So when I got over to the table with the sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to find white sugar, brown sugar, liquid sugar as well as some others that I am blanking on right now because I haven't had enough coffee quite yet.  If you are coming here with a computer or tablet, I would suggest making sure that you are fully charged before you leave the house because, while there are some outlets, when it is this busy, you are lucky to get one.  Oh, and if you like to people watch, then there are some great window spots from which to partake in the Willy St. visual delights.  I also like that there are all kinds  in here, and that it isn't super hipster, studious, trendy, shaggy, business casual and so forth.  No need to feel out of place just to get some coffee.  Long story short: good coffee but a refill will cost you 85 cents, and snazzy décor for when you zone out from whatever you actually came here to do."}
{"text":"Great coffee and service! Love the atmosphere as well!  Plenty of bike parking in front,  cozy seating in the back. Vintage decor and great baked goods as well."}
{"text":"I had a perfect cappuccino at ground zero this morning.  Tons of foam and delicious."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Dropped by for an early cup.  Nice relaxing atmosphere, looked like plenty of places to sit and relax for a long while.  Good selection on the coffee but my coffee was just average.  Will probably try again in the future and will repost if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite coffee shops to go to in Madison because it was more inviting than most of the coffee shops present. (I was intimidated by not being \"hipster enough\" at many of them. They have some food items and there is plenty of seating. What is funny about this coffee house is it seems EVERYONE comes here to work on their laptops...it is rare to find anyone talking. There are couches, which I loved. It is nice to be able to be so relaxed and feel at home without your strung our, high roommates talking to the walls...  ...oh you don't have that problem? It is rather frequent in Madison..."}
{"text":"My favorite Coffee place in Madison !  The capuchino is strong, the pastries are good, and the service is excellent. I also like the ambiance, relax and eclectic."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Madison, we usually grab a bag of the atomic blend or mexican blend for the trip home. Good stuff. Worth the valuable space in the carry on."}
{"text":"I prefer their locations on e. Wash and park st., but this place is better than the chains...I am not a coffee drinker and would like to see their tea selection improve...good basic lunches and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got a skin latte and a cranberry muffin. The latte was better than expected. The muffin, however, was terrible. I think they make it from a frozen mix because something about it just tasted off (like freezer burn). Service was not great.... I said hello to the girl working the espresso machine and she just stared at me. Service was pretty slow considering how empty it was."}
{"text":"Coffee was decent. Not a bad atmosphere. However, rude service. I brought in a  small paper bag with a croissant in it that I had purchased elsewhere, though it was not totally obvious that it was food. When the barista served me my coffee he was like \"I'm sorry, but we don't allow outside food. You can't eat that in here.\" RUDE. rude. rude. I'm glad I didn't immediately leave a tip because they get NONE. I don't even think they sell croissants, so WTF? And being rude to me is going to make me want to buy their food? I think not. The only plus in this place is that they have free Wi-Fi and weren't playing annoying music."}
{"text":"I'm an occasional visitor of cafes, doing most of my coffee consumption and PC playing at home. I recently attended a meetup here on a Saturday. I can attest to the fact that it's a fine place to get together with a group for coffee and conversation .Although we did not avail ourselves of it, there is a very comfortable group seating area in the back with sofas. The room is large and comfortable, and well-lit with natural light. Very non-claustrophobic..The menu is what one would expect in an independent cafe-coffees, teas and pastries.  I did not try the food the food choices, and only sampled a latte. Three choices of sizes, it was a warm and creamy antidote to a chilly March day. it was happily and quickly prepared by pleasant couple of baristas.The location is very convenient to Capitol Square, and private parking is available. All in all, a very comfortable and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Good coffee and there's a parking lot!  Really cute place. the decor is old maps and cameras. There is table seating as well as couches.   A great place to enjoy a book and a beverage.  I ordered a cafe au lait and was very happy with my choice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whether hosting me for a work meeting or an awkward first date, Ground Zero has been A-OK.   + tasty drinks - I've had the hot chocolate and the peach iced tea + nice staff (though sometimes a little spacey - the last barista seemed confused when I asked if there was caffeine in their mint tea [there is]) + puffy chairs in the back corner are really comfortable and great for reading - seating is really close together and the high-tops by the window are crazy high - parking tends to be an issue if you're staying for the long haul - early hours - I went late one afternoon and was surprised to be shuttled out soon after because they were closing; my fault for not checking hours, but surprising for not being in an office-heavy area that otherwise shuts down at 5  Ground Zero isn't my favorite coffee shop in town, but I also wouldn't decline going."}
{"text":"Good coffee stop here today. I also had a toasted bagel, and a tuna sandwich. Everything really good. Comfy arrangement for wi-fi, sitting...thanks folks. Nice place you have."}
{"text":"a friend and i dropped in for coffee during the willy street fair, and i was wowed. the baristas are pleasant and fast, the coffee is delicious, and the decor is fantastic - old schoolroom maps and lockers, with tons of space to sit. i really liked this place and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Ground Zero is a lovely local coffee shop - they have tasty drinks, light food (sandwiches and baked goods), comfy couches in the back, as well as plenty of natural light coming in through the windows during the day. The staff is almost always very friendly, and great with recommendations, too.  Theres's free wifi and a decent number of outlets, which makes occasionally working there for a few hours pleasant and efficient (and you can pop by El Dorado next door for a meal afterwords!)  I've also had a number of local meetup groups I've either been a part of or a host for use GZ as a meeting space. There's a large table (as well as some comfy chairs and couches) in the back that make small-group meetings really easy to facilitate, and again, the staff are wonderful at helping make things happen.  There's also a limited amount of off-street parking, which is both a blessing and a curse in the Willy St neighborhood. That it exists at all is wonderful, and the whole lot opens up on the weekends, but if you're there during the week, watch where you park, and make sure you're in a GZ-designated spot!  My only other complaint is their hours -- they're great if I want to go work during the day, or meet up with friends on the weekend, but if I want to get coffee with someone in the evening, I have to go elsewhere -- they close at 6pm!"}
{"text":"Cargo Coffee has the best roast in Madison hands down. Nice location away from campus so more relaxing and less distracting. The staff is always friendly and Knowledgeable about there products. Even the simple food menu meets ones needs. I look forward to stoping every time I'm passing by."}
{"text":"I love my coffee. I love ground zero. I have spent many hours studying here. I took my in-laws here! Great personality and feel. Almost every time I am there, I have issues choosing what I want to drink and the baristas are very patient and willing to recommend a great drink!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I've been here at least 5 times and the coffee is always good and the baristas are friendly.  Additionally there is hassle free parking in back.  My only suggestion is that it's not necessarily a good place to meet more than 4 people at once as larger tables are at a premium."}
{"text":"INT: Ground Zero - Day. Barista yelps behind counter.  BARISTA: Does somebody have a red Nissan Juke parked across the street? The city is towing your car.  Exit Corey. Frazzled. Oy.   EXT: Curbside. Wide shot. Tow Truck. The Jew & His Juke. Traffic Cop.   COREY: Oh my gosh are there parking restrictions here? I saw a bunch of cars parked across from the cafe and figured it was ok.  TRAFFIC COP: You see that sign that says no parking 4:00-5:30.   POV: Sign.   COREY: Oh man.  TRAFFIC COP: What time is it?   POV: Watch.  COREY: 4:18.  EXT: Willy Street. No cars parked.   TRAFFIC COP: We need both lanes to keep traffic moving from 4:00-5:30.   COREY: Shoot. I just moved here, been here for 3 days. I'm really sorry.   TRAFFIC COP: What do you think of the car? You like it?   COREY: It's great!  TRAFFIC COP: I'll go ahead and exit out of this screen. (POV: Ticket Generator.) That way you won't have to pay the towing fee, just the $45 parking citation.   COREY: Ok, I appreciate that.   TRAFFIC COP: So seriously, anything you don't like about this car? I'm going to get one.   END.  Thanks Ground Zero barista. Because of you I didn't have to go find my car last week. Because of you I could stay and work (which is awesome thanks to free WIFI, ample tables and strategic outlets) while I sipped on the best cold brew I've found in Madison. The search continues, but after four places, you guys are tops!"}
{"text":"Ground Zero is a solid coffee shop. The parking lot next to Ground Zero is a plus!   Good seasonal drinks, reasonable prices. Nice ambiance. Love the worn wood floors. Lots of space. Doesn't get too loud even if the place is full, which is a plus if you're trying to work. Wifi connection is decent.   They could have a little more breakfast food variety. Other than that, great spot!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. They have plenty of tables for people to do work, and they also have. A cute little section with couches. Everything here is reasonably priced. They also have suburb baristas who are very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty OK sandwich and cheese soup, cold service and cold space. Turn the AC down, please. The wi-fi is shit and kept dropping me over and over again, causing me to lose work.   Eh... maybe I try another day."}
{"text":"Very nice place to sit down and work. Nice environment, friendly people, quiet. The food/drink offerings are actually quite good by coffee shop standards."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop with some simple and tasty breakfast and lunch options. Big windows provide lots of natural light."}
{"text":"Lots of sunlight and seating options for relaxing.  Some coffee shops (*cough* Starbucks *cough*) are purposefully remodeling interiors to discourage lingering patrons, but Ground Zero recently had a freshening up and still maintains both work spaces and lounging chairs.  Baristas are friendly and there's a lot of different coffee roasts from which you can choose.  The adjacent parking lot can be a little tight, but that's par for the course in this neighborhood.  Right now this is one of my top choices for coffee shops on Willy St."}
{"text":"Always my favorite spot to study, relax and have a sip of my favorite mocha treat! The ambience is so hippy that makes me always happy :) Today, I tried their sandwich and learned that they are very similar with Cargo's. I think I read about it on other's review that these two places are sisters.  I'll try to stick with the locals! They need to survive and they're fab too!   *We actually were aimed to have some tea at Machatea but 4th of July has made most the coffee shops in Madison closed. But, Ground zero is never a bad idea. It's super!"}
