{"text":"Je suis allée 2 fois, la 1ère fois le café était excellent mais la 2eme fois j'ai été déçue"}
{"text":"A hidden gem if you ask me! Tastefully decorated, as most places around the Old Port!  This little coffee shop offers a couple of confortable counter sits.  If you order to stay, you will get a what you order cutely presented on a small wooden tray.  The barista is the friendliest, the coffee is delicious and the pastries are fresh and tasty! The soy latte is fantastic! What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the smooth latte. Innovative use of limited space. Appreciated the friendly willing staff for 2 weary travellers from Oz.  Hope to return."}
{"text":"The barista was super friendly and made great coffee.  They also have a maple syrup latté which was tasty."}
{"text":"The space is so small to enjoy their coffee. Space for 5 people but during winter time... with our coats.. hmm  This cafe is great for take out and their croissant is amazing! That's why I give them 4 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome croissant, fantastic soy steam and regular milk stream, pretty good espresso pull. Very nice, intimate coffee shop. Barista at the time of visit was very friendly."}
{"text":"Very interesting little cafe tucked away in the Old Port.  Well worth a visit. The decor is small and intimate: this cafe can only suit maybe 5 people or so. Flyjin is more tailored to a coffee on-the-go, as their service is fast and the coffee is better than other options in the area.  Very distinct lattes. Extremely thick and creamy, quite different than most cafes in Montreal who usually treat the frothing differently.   Definitely worth a try if you are in the area. They also have little muffins and treats, as well as fresh-squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance ! Atmosphere! The dinner was tasteful but too pricey... I would not hesitate to go there again for its quality though ..."}
{"text":"I love this little coffee joint! I've had both iced lattes and traditional hot lattes. Wowza, prior texture and smooth with fruity overtones and citrus finish.   If you're a coffee snob, you'll love Flyin' !  You can order at the street window or come into the modes but well appointed indoor shop! Thy also serve fresh squired OJ and have a nice little selection of pastries."}
{"text":"La petite place est sympathique, bien cachée dans un édifice à bureau. Le café est bien, le service aussi, quoi qu'il y ait un peu d'attente dû au fait qur le barista est seul à faite le café et le comptoir. Pour une place assise, il faut être chanceux mais je crois que le concept veut plutôt qu'on prenne pour apporter ou sur place un petit espresso vite fait. Ils offrent les pâtisseries Hof Kelsten ( qui sont très bonnes), bref agréable petit café \"de quartier\" bien qu'il soit situé dans une zone très touristique."}
{"text":"Une excellente adresse pour un café rapide pour emporter.  Joli décor. Barista sympathique et efficace.  Petit mais chaleureux. Pas un endroit pour s'asseoir et venir y passer des heures à travailler."}
{"text":"Best cafe I've been to so far. Small intimate bar space. The interior was cozy, and filled with vibrant colors. The chai latte is to die for...it was a lot larger than the servings of other cafes, however, the quality was not compromised in any way and it was actually one of the best chai lattes I've ever had. The barista was super friendly, super approachable, and he even gave us some tips on where my friend and I could cafe hop to."}
{"text":"One of the best coffees in Montreal.  I might even say the best, but I haven't tried as many places as I'd like in order to claim that just yet.  I was tempted to take my coffee to go when I saw how small the joint was but I cozied up to the bar and I'm a better person today for that decision to stay.  Although it's in Old Port, they definitely seem to have their regulars as the baristas knew who ordered what.  The space is small and well designed. Not sure if they sell alcohol but it felt like they should. It was like being in a little dive bar except it's clean and your laptop is welcomed. The staff was friendly but not overly. When my barista saw that I wasn't taking my cup away, she brought over a glass of water with a smile. Great playlist and a chat with another barista about that and how great coffee is made.  Enjoyed people watching, especially the people just ordering at the window off the street. Ended up having a really insightful conversation about life with a random stranger.  Okay, social commentary time...put your phone down and try talking to a live person, a complete stranger. I dare you. You might learn something about yourself."}
{"text":"The café is my new favourite in Old Port. Stop by with a book, a friend, or a place to be and you can get a great espresso drink to stay or to go. They rotate the variety of their Anchored beans often, which helps keep me coming back, and the owner really helps make the atmosphere friendly and comfortable.   The Flyjin espresso bar is about well-roasted beans and well-made drinks. Bring a friend and try an allongé or gibraltar if you like a well-bodied espresso."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy place to have a coffee drink or fresh pressed orange juice nestled in the Old Port. This small café is a great place to escape the touristy vibe of the rest of the neighbourhood and enjoy a refreshing treat. Seating is limited to a counter with a few seats, but there usually isn't too big of a crowd here."}
{"text":"This little espresso bar on St-Pierre just off the main tourist strip of St-Paul in Old Montreal is a great spot for a quick coffee when you are looking for quality caffeination but are not in the mood to wait in line for a table at the noisy and always hectic O+G around the corner.  Not that everyone will appreciate this but for a giant design nerd like myself, the super modern minimalistic wood interior with 60s-inspired collages on the walls and well-curated design magazine rack was a huge bonus.   For real though if you are in the old port and need to kill a half an hour or so and don't want to have to sit next to American tourists with fanny packs, this place is your best bet by far."}
{"text":"5 stars because the kindly service and the warm smile of staff. Cozy tiny place, good coffee ( selon mon ami ) et jus d'orage frais pressé juste devant nous et quelques patisseries. Choix de musique feutrée. Its always wonderful for me when you can have fresh orange juice in a coffee athmosphere ;)"}
