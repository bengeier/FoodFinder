{"text":"Hello Yelpers, normally I am the type who likes to read reviews and not writing a review. However, this afternoon I decided to grab some sushi rolls from Ebisu because it was convenient to where I was and I always see a decent amount of people inside of the restaurant, so why not. Little do I know, it was the worst decision I ever made. I ordered the most simple rolls from the short list menu : California and Dynamic. Thinking to myself, man this is going to be great and finally getting my sushi fix. I got my order and went home, being all excited. As I was opening the plastic, I saw the California roll looking decent but soon as I saw the Dynamic roll, I immediately thought out loud \" WTF\"!?! This is better be a joke, this is what I get for 6 freaking pieces of sushi roll. Unripe avocado with brown roots in it (which I can deal with), but all pieces looks like someone had digged a hole to take out something that they don't like. Seriously, I didnt paid $13 + tips for two unprofessional rolls for take out?. I don't understand why you want to cheap out on the ingredients and hope I wouldn't notice. Ridiculous, especially they weren't even BUSY. Ebisu, you made me disappointed and I will definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"I've been to the ebisu in Vancouver so tried this one out... I came here with a friend and got totally stuffed. We tried some appetizers, sushi, ramen, and some cheap pitchers to go with it. Food was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere, music, and even caught the game. Great place. You should go."}
{"text":"I have had better sushi from all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants that others would avoid at all costs. For a self-proclaimed \"famous\" sushi restaurant, the quality of the fish here was deplorable. Fishy-smelling, greyish in colour (although that could be the lighting - very dim at night). The prices are ridiculous - $10 for 3 pieces of nigiri? The standards are low - rolls that fall apart before they are even picked up. The staff is nice, but ultimately, not enough to compensate for the food. Would never, ever go back."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Fujisan ramen.  It's literally a mountain of bean sprouts.  Lifting a few pieces of pork or chicken.  Who put bean sprouts in their ramen anyway?  I had to dig really deep to find the few strands of ramen.  Very disappointing experience.  Left the restaurant hungry."}
{"text":"As a Vancouverite, I've been to Ebisu many times on the west coast, so I thought I would give the Toronto location a try. The menu is very different from the Vancouver one so do not have the same expectations. We ordered a variety of dishes off the menu including one of the ramen bowls. Everything met my expectations and for a place that doesn't specialize in ramen, I thought the ramen was quite good. The fish was fresh, the dishes were presentable and the service was professional."}
{"text":"Soft opening lunch special. Combo available are ramen and donburi, with a bit of varieties in side options. For downtown to get a combo under $15, it is quite good, and filling.  The ramen is quite standard compare to other known competitor in area. Karaage order does not have too much batter and maintain juiciness, not oily at all"}
{"text":"There are plenty of decent sushi places on Queen St ... And this one tries to stand above them, but it missed the mark. First, there is a wide assortment of izikaya inspired items.  The torched sushi was nicely presented to us, they even torched it in front of us by our server! But sadly that made this sushi slightly over cooked (for sushi anyway) and made the rice bed fall apart (or it was just bad rice in the first place). We tried one of their special REAL crab rolls and it was ...unremarkable; while it definitely had a real crab texture, nothing about the roll excited me. I give top marks for effort, but for the premium prices, I expect better results."}
{"text":"Their soft opening was today. I had Miso Ramen and a mini curry don. The broth was alright but the chasu wasn't torched enough. It was too soft and 90% fat. The curry was alright but way too pasty for my taste. The apetizer that comes with the combo is really tiny."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, food quality was quite good. Out of 6 dishes that we ordered 3 were very good (Sashimi salad, Ebisu roll, and Salmon Carpacchio), 2 were good (Spicy Sashimi salad and Gyoza) and  one was ok (Takoyaki). My girlfriend and I were there on Sunday and they had Sunday special: a pitcher of Saporro beer for 9.99. We didn't even finish half of it, but still it was nice. Overall, Ebisu is a nice friendly place with decent food, I will come there again, this time with my husband: he certainly wouldn't have a problem with finishing a pitcher of beer :)"}
{"text":"Impressed with this type of bar on Queen.  Usually you'd find a bar like this in the yonge+sheppard/finch corridor.  It's essentially a watered down, but better Guu.  Menu is a multitude of sharing plates topped off with ramen.  The shoyu ramen was better than expected given that this is not a dedicated ramen spot.  Broth was not overly salty and the meat was nice and fatty.  Uni nigiri was on special - it was fresh and we ended ordering 6.  Beef carpacio was excellent and I could have easily indulged in more fried oysters.   The box sushi was nothing special, but they do torch them at your table which is fun to watch.  Bonus:  They have $9.99 sapporo pitcher specials.  Add more TV's and this place could easily be a go-to."}
{"text":"The place has a very fun and friendly atmosphere. I should have clued in the many empty seats though. It's not great value and the quality isn't what you'd expect.   We had the seared salmon sushi; the rice was too mushy. The theatre of them blowtorching the salmon at the table was cool, but it took a while and there really want enough sear for that charcoal-taste perfection. The Vancouver roll was decent. The real crab in the roll really was tasty. The chicken kaarage was nothing special. Overall, for the price vs quality, I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Came for late lunch on Monday. It was around 1 PM and the restaurant was mostly empty, Hostess let me grab a large table up front and then brought over a menu.  It's a clean restaurant with nice decor. Dim lighting overall, with artwork hung on the walls. Washrooms are clean, but no warm water from the tap.  I had heard that the fish here was very good, so I decided to get the chirashi zushi boxes. I asked the waitress what was in the box and she was well-informed of the ingredients (after having pulled out a notepad).  So I got the chirashi, and after checking in on yelp realized I could also get a complimentary order of karaage, so I got one as well.  Service takes some time, like 5 minutes or so, but the box came eventually. It's a nice box with a few different slices of fish (tuna, salmon, something else), a piece of shrimp, a bunch of imitation crab, over a bed of rice with seasoning. The fish was tasty. It was nice and cool, and when you bite into it, it had a firm chewy texture.  The karaage came a few minutes later, and you could see the smoke rising from it. It's a fairly large piece of chicken, and it's not heavily battered. When you bite into it, it's still very hot inside. The chicken is very tender and flavourful, and the tartar sauce elevates it even further.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal, and would be interested in some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a friend who won a set course dinner for 2 and I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of their offerings! We were given 4 courses each, and dishes were prepared and brought to us after we had finished the prior dish. This was particularly nice because we actually spent a loooong time there talking (almost 4 hours) so I'm really glad they never rushed us!   1st course = 3 distinct appetizers: the first was egg wrapped in smoked salmon, the second was raw oyster with roe and uni, and the third was deep fried lotus root. The egg was very moist and juicy and worked fairly well with the smoked salmon in my opinion. The raw oyster, despite tiny, was also plump and yummy! It wasn't fishy at all and its flavour was really enhanced by the bursting roe and uni. Finally, the deep fried lotus root was an interesting concept that wasn't bad to taste but while I was eating it, a piece of the lotus root fell out from under the deep fried shell and I saw that the hole was still filled with uncooked flour. No thanks!  2nd course = potato salad with roe and baked miso salmon. The potato salad had a nice balance of creaminess and crunchiness and was immediately made so much classier by the abundant amount of roe provided. The salmon, in itself, was deliiiiicious - super tender and buttery, BUT its caveat was that it was completely drenched in oversalty miso paste. I wanted to eat the mushrooms that were cooked atop the salmon but they were so salty that I couldn't.  3rd course = choice of either pressed salmon sushi or ramen. The salmon sushi was torched at the table which was nice to watch and it was covered in a sauce that was creamy and sweet. Paired with a small lemon wedge to add that extra kick of sourness made it overall a really enjoyable dish!  The ramen was mediocre.   4th course = 3 distinct desserts: the first was vanilla ice cream with matcha powder, the second was almond (tofu?) cheesecake, and the third was a cup of jelly cubes topped with mochi, blackberries, and red bean paste. All 3 were very standard, nothing particularly special.   The employees here are all very soft-spoken females who aren't too familiar with English so I found it very difficult to ask questions about the menu/our set course meal. Overall though, they were all very pleasant and nice!"}
{"text":"I was able to try Ebisu on Queen with a free ramen voucher from the Gourmand Club. We came in around 5 o'clock and were seated quickly, and given water. The menu is a good amount with sushi, chirashi, and ramen. I got the shoyu (soy sauce) ramen. It took a while for the ramen to come out but that's okay! The shoyu composed of a rich broth, ramen noodles, 2-3 slices of pork, bamboo, half a poached egg, and green onion to garnish.The soup is a bit too salty for me but the flavours blend in well with each other. The egg was perfect too and I loved how the bamboo added a great taste.   The servers are great and they were constantly refilling our waters too. Super kind staff. I would definitely come back to try the chirashi!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and made reservations for 6. We were quickly seated and most of us ordered chirashi, raw fish on rice. We randomly started receiving food. 2 dishes came out within half an hour and it took 50 mins for the 3 chirashi lunches to arrive! There is no cooking involved for those dishes,only assembly. Taking close to an hour for food to come out is unacceptable, no one server seemed to be concerned that our food didn't arrive on time prior to asking them to check on our order.  They did however give us a 10% discount. The food we had was just middle of the road sushi/sashimi, nothing outstanding and definitely not worth risking a chance for another 50 min wait. I'll won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The Saffron Cream Mussels were served in a pot reminiscent of the ones served in Belgium -- mussels and frites.  It came with some sliced baguettes.  I really liked the saffron cream soup that the mussels sat in.  It was tasty and the mussels were fresh!  I wished that there was more mussels in the little pot actually.  I definitely had to order one of their Signature Rolls, the Ebisu Roll.  It had eel tempura, salmon, tuna, avocado, mango, and cream cheese.  It wasn't until this roll was served to our table that we realized that it was going to be blow torched and torched right at our table too!  We made sure that our cameras were ready to catch this live.  When it came to eating it though, the Ebisu Roll wasn't too particularly delicious or notable.  It was a big piece of sushi roll since there was so much in it and I had to make sure that I didn't drop anything when picking the sushi roll up."}
{"text":"What can go wrong with $1 oysters & $10 pitchers of sapporo?? Sushi was also delicious, got the salmon aburi, along with the octopus balls and raptor roll! Great value for your money and the waitresses were very friendly! Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered miso ramen for dinner. It was incredibly salty and had too much ginger flavour. We had to ask for a cup of hot water to pour it into the ramen, and it helped a little bit, but still far from being delicious. We've tried quite a bit of ramen in the past and this was by far the worst. Paid $13.50 per, which is way too high. I wouldn't eat it even if it was half price. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food.  Portions are a bit light but similar to other \"like\" Japanese restaurants.  Seating and decor is very good:  comfortable and music was not too loud so we were able to hold a conversation without screaming.  Lots of selection of food but you should order some Ramen or Rice to avoid breaking the bank if you are hungry.  Too bad they were sold out of the signature dishes that we wanted...oh well, try it next time."}
{"text":"Not a lot of selection but the seared Philly rolls and spinach salad that I had was delicious! Service was very quick."}
{"text":"I heard great things from friends having tried Ebisu on the west coast and therefore, I was super excited to try this place out. For two, we ordered a mackerel torched pressed sushi, a bbq squid, an unagi (eel) bowl and a cheesy curry bowl. Out of all these dishes, the only one that delivered was the bbq squid.   The pressed mackerel sushi was essentially big chunks of sushi rice, with a tiny bit of mackerel on top and a drizzle of sauce, which was torched at our table by the waitress. Albeit torching it for a good 2 minutes, there was barely any char taste to the sushi. It felt like I was eating chunks of rice with some mackerel on top.   Both rice bowl were of an deceiving size (definitely not enough to feed one person) albeit being 12$ (for the cheesy curry) and 15$ (for the unagi). The biggest disappointment was the cheesy curry and its 5 pieces of shaved cheese on top... It was even more space than any decoration you'd add on a dish.   For this whole meal, we paid a total of $70 with tax and tips and came back home still hungry."}
{"text":"No complaints!  Great atmosphere, and friendly service.  We had the brussel sprouts (which I thought was kind of weird for a Japanese restaurants), ebisu roll, seared mackerel sushi, and the bbq eel bowl.  All were delicious, and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good  make sure to get the torched one. The ramen is soso less portion compare to other ramen restaurant. Make sure to watch the chef fillet the fish if you get the chance and talk to him about his cooking journey."}
{"text":"Their Fuji san ramen is the best ramen in Toronto! Another Juro kei ramen beside Jinya! The good thing is that they're serving this awesome ramen below$10 between happy hour(14-18hr). Now this is definitely my favourite ramen!   ???????????????Fuji san?????????????????????? ???????????????Jinya?Cha cha cha????????????????"}
{"text":"A high quality Japanese restaurant in the Entertainment District with reasonable prices. The sashimi and sushi are incredibly fresh. A seared Tina special melted in my mouth. I am so happy to see such quality combined with great service. I highly recommend it, especially for those who, like me, have cravings for sashimi. Yet I'm going to come back to explore a very interesting tapas menu, as well."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but this Japanese restaurant did not meet my expectations. It's also expensive and portion sizes were tiny. I rather take my money to Miku or Japango and have a better dining experience and treatment. I should mention that I was in the party of 30 people. The presentation they had was just average. I was expecting the presenter to demo his slicing skills with a big fish, but he used a small fish that was the size of a tadpole, but longer. There wasn't any wow factor. The restaurant was running out of everything, so I wasn't sure if they ran out of big fishes as well. My night just went downhill from there. Food took forever to arrive, food portions were tiny, not much variety in fish and staff didn't seem prepared to handle big groups and were clumsy, as a result. I was also looking forward to the trio dessert platter everyone received. For our table, we got tempura battered ice cream which seems to be kind of cheap. Everyone received a different experience depending where they were sitting. 15% tip was also added to the bill, which was uncalled for... due to poor service. I was a little bit hesitant in writing this review, but the restaurant should be more prepared for future large events. Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with a friend to grab some quick bites. The place didn't seem too full for dinner time (7:30pm). We had to wait for a couple of minutes before any server noticed us waiting for a table. We got seated to a small table right next to the window.   The items on the menu were quite limited, small selection of salads, appetizers and few different types of ramen. They also had a limited alcohol menu as well. We each ordered a ramen. We didn't get serve drinks or water until our food came, felt like the server totally forgot when it wasn't even busy.  The taste of the ramen were average, nothing too different compared to other ramen places. Soup was good, not amazing though. The portion sizes were quite small, I'm not a big eater but after eating the ramen and drinking some soup, I was still hungry. I cannot imagine paying $14 for a bowl of ramen which doesn't even fill you!!  Overall, I wouldn't come back to this place, servers are inattentive, quality of food was average, prices are on the pricey side considering the portion sizes."}
{"text":"They had a Fujisan noodle soup special between 2 to 6pm and decided to go for it. The interior was decent. Nice decor. Candles in every table. When we checked into Yelp, we got an offer for free Chicken Karaage which we took it. The Karaage was good although bit fatty. Came with some spicy mayo to dip into.  I ordered the Karaage noon with spicy soup base. The bowl of noodle was humungus, with bean sprout piled high above the bowl like Mt. Fujisan. The taste was so so. Wasn't able to finish the whole bowl."}
{"text":"The decor was charming. Attentive wait staff. Food was flavorful but the portion size small. We hadn't known this style of restaurant is more tapas style. My friend and I had three dishes shared, and still hungry for more. And quite pricey.   Yes, I still recommend."}
{"text":"Went here after work for happy hour (2pm to 6pm) where tapas are 50% off! Ordered the takoyaki and karaage. The takoyaki was delicious!!! Super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Lots of sauce. Optimal size. Only $3.50, it was phenomenal. I'll definitely come back for this.   The karaage was okay. Pretty mediocre. $4.50. Came with the spicy mayo sauce on the side altho I think I'd prefer if it were drizzled on too instead. Crispy and juicy though.   Also ordered the chicken teriyaki rice bowl which came with rice, teriyaki chicken and some tempura (2 shrimp, zucchini, yam, and eggplant). This was okay as well.   They also have beer during happy hour $3.99 a pint! Will probably come back to try this sometime.   No wifi unfortunately. The washroom was pretty clean and the food was pretty fast. The servers are also very attentive and refilled our waters often. They take cash credit and debit."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but their portions are typical japanese (small). I paid $15 for lunch and I was hungry in 2 hours.   Not good for lunch if it is your main meal of the day."}
{"text":"A fine Japanese restaurant, I didn't try the ramen but the sukiyaki beef and sashimi don instead. For me, the taste is fairly good, worth a try."}
{"text":"Went here during a trip with my family. It was late night and we haven't had dinner. We were the last group of customers they accepted, but their service was great! A bit rush but still polite, and rushing is understandable.  Food was okay. Bento boxes were a bit too expensive for what you get. (you can get these for a lot cheaper at other places)  Fuji mountain ramen looks cool, but it's mostly sprouts instead of noodles or meat or other things.  Overall, okay food, good service, clean environment."}
{"text":"The restaurant chain is from Vancouver and the food is average.  Ordered the bbq beef short ribs, presentation is good where you can grill your own meat.  However the ribs is already cook so I don't really understand what the fire grill is for?!  The seared box sushi is again average, and the one thing I like is the shrimp gyoza."}
{"text":"** Review for Special Set Menu **  I went with a big group of 30 people on Mar 12, 2017 to try out their $28 Special Set Menu. The Special Set included an appetizer, 2 mains, a sashimi boat, and a dessert. The sashimi chef also did a sashimi prepping presentation for our group during our dinner.   Environment: The restaurant is at a really good location that is walking distance from the Queen West/University intersection, where the Osgoode subway station is.  The interior of the restaurant is rather long and narrow, thus making it more suitable for small groups of 4 or less. Our group of 30 was pretty much an exception from their usual crowd, so I guess the most they can accommodate at a time would be around 20 people.  I really like the decor at the restaurant, such as the lighting fixture and the pictures on the wall. The bar and the sushi making station are open-kitchen concept so you can see them prepping for your food.    Food: The funny thing was they actually didn't prepare enough Special Set Menu for everybody in our group because some didn't specify their preferences ahead of time. Well I can't really blame the restaurant for not preparing enough food and I appreciate that they went out to get extra ingredients to accommodate our unusually large group. Appetizer: Oyster with Uni and Ikura (fish roe), Daikon, Smoked Salmon. I loved the taste of the Uni and Fish Roe, great flavour and without any of the fishy taste.  Main 1: We actually had a choice between 2 options for each of our 2 mains, but everybody chose the Salmon Chan-chan Yaki (grilled salmon with miso & vegetables). The flavour of the salmon was really interesting. It was marinated in miso and was baked in a paper wrapper. The miso was great and had a lot of depth, and from the extreme saltiness I guess it's pretty authentic miso. On the side there were potato salad with fish roe, also great flavour.   Main 2: choice between Motoyaki Battera Sushi (torched sushi) and Cha-syu Tonkotsu Shio Ramen. Both were pretty small in terms of portions. I got the sushi and it tasted great, the fish was fresh and had great flavour from the sauces.  Sashimi Presentation: this was the highlight of the night when we got up close and examine how the chef prepares the sashimi. The chef started with a whole fish, and then he de-boned it, removed the skin, and then sliced it into small thin pieces. He was really experienced and every step of the process was like watching the creation of an art piece, even down to how he carved the vegetables for decoration on the sashimi boat.  Dessert: Ebisu Dolce (Assorted dessert plate, Yuzu Cheesecake, Ice cream, Anmitsu. I liked the vanilla ice cream with matcha powder sprinkled on top and the mochi was great as well.  Yelp Check-in Bonus: Chicken Karaage. Initially they said they wouldn't honour it because there were too many of us checking in. However, we did end up getting 6-7 plates with 3 pieces each. The Chicken Karaage was very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, great bonus for the night indeed.   Service: The waitresses were so lost throughout our entire meal lol. I guess they weren't expecting so many people to show up for their special menu, so they were rushing to get everything together.  However, there's still no excuse to poor service when we were trying to place our orders and getting drinks. It took them 30 minutes to get our drink orders and a while to get our refills. I find it strange that they required us to pay for our drinks first, even the $2 pop. I can understand that they want to keep the tabs on who ordered alcohol, but seriously for $2 pop drinks?? Well have fun getting fees charged on the credit card transactions.   Our entire meal took 4 hours to complete, that some of us joked that we were pretty much getting French-Japanese food due to its long duration. Subtracting 1 star due to the service, but the food was awesome."}
{"text":"So we were wandering around Queen Street on Saturday night, attempting to find somewhere to eat, when we stumbled upon Ebisu. I'd never heard of the place before but a quick google check informed us that it's a Vancouver chain that's made its way to Toronto.  (Plus, since it was a soft opening, food was 20% off. Who can say no to that?)  The one-page, pictureless menu didn't offer any help in terms of what's what, so we just winged it and ordered:  Ebisu Roll (Unagi Tempura & cream cheese wrapped on top of mango, avocado, cucumber, & salmon, then torched): The interesting thing about this one is that our waitress actually torched it just after it arrived to the table. This, however, turned out to be pointless, as the torching was so brief that it didn't affect the taste at all. The roll is otherwise good but nothing special, with the cream cheese taste a little overwhelming, to be honest.  Salmon Pepper Popper (Atlantic salmon, prawn tempura & fresh cut jalapeno peppers prepared \"Battera-style\" then layered in special Motoyaki, then seared at the table): Again, this was torched tableside by our waitress, but again, she did it so quickly that it had no real effect on the taste. (I've tasted properly torched sushi and it is delicious and impossible to mistake.) The jalapeno peppers didn't offer a hint of spice, admittedly, and the dish, like the previous one, was fine but pretty forgettable.  We also ordered a roll topped with caviar and stuffed with avocado and some kind of seafood. Do I need to say that it was good yet unmemorable?  I think Ebisu has potential to be a much better sushi joint. For one thing, the wait staff needs to learn how to properly torch certain dishes. And the prices need to come down. We paid a not-insignificant amount of money and left the restaurant as hungry as when we arrived."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked since it opened but didn't have a chance to try it out until recently. Came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Sunday around 7:30pm and the restaurant wasn't very busy.   We were seated right away and after looking at the menu we decided on the following:  * Hamachi Jalapeno Battera * Sashimi  * Takowasa  Takowasa was probably the only decent dish we had here unfortunately. Downfall is there were only four pieces of seaweed with the dish whereas other places gave a lot more. Good thing there was only two of us sharing.   The sashimi was drenched in sauce and it was not fresh either. The amount of sauce ruined the dish entirely but more importantly quality was poor.   Sushi was equally as bad. It was hand torched at the table and looked interesting but ended up tasting like warm sushi. This also wasn't very fresh and I most definitely have had better.   Overall, in terms of pricing and quality I will not return here. The food here is disappointing and not worth trying out. Perhaps quality has changed since it has opened but it is not what either of us expected. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend to celebrate my birthday on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty empty so we were seated quickly. Off to a good start!   The food I tried:  1. Fried Oysters (4.5/5) -Very good, bite sized, would order again   2. Chicken Karaage (3.5/5)  -pieces were a little too big in my opinion  -spicier than I thought   3. Today's 5 pick sashimi (3.5/5)  -the 5 I got were shrimp, salmon, sea urchin, tuna and I forget the last one..  -the sea urchin was surprisingly REALLY good  -tuna was cut too thick, I broke it up into small pieces   4. Seared box salmon sushi (3.5/5) -not the best I've had but still pretty decent  The staff were great, and always making sure we were doing well. The highlight of the night was when the manager offered my friend and I free desserts off their new menu (not knowing it was my birthday so it was a nice surprise!). The dessert we got was the black sesame creme brûlée (must try!!) and a cheesecake (meh).   Overall it was a pretty good experience. No complaints about atmosphere or the service. The food was decent and would come back because it's somewhat better priced than other izakya places."}
{"text":"My appetizer included one raw oyster, uni, roe, salmon sashimi, and steamed vegetables like mushrooms. The oyster, uni, roe and sashimi are really fresh and taste so delicious even though I am not a sashimi fan! And once I checked in on Yelp, I got a coupon for a free chicken karaage. The chicken was so juicy!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night, around 6 - 7:30pm, and I was surprised it wasn't too busy (around 5 tables occupied). There were around 3 waitresses so the service was quick and friendly.   Before I get into the other good aspects, one thing that disturbed me a lot at Ebisu was the fruit flies. There were 2 that were constantly flying around our table/food which is kind of gross and annoying at the same time...  They have happy hour before 6PM for certain tapas at 50% (i.e. takoyaki, edamame, avocado salad, chicken karaage, spicy sashimi). This is a great and wallet friendly deal so try to visit before 6pms! I ordered the takoyaki ($6.95 reg/ $3.50 happy hour), and it came with 6 balls. It felt a bit under-cooked since the inside was still very wet and mushy... however, they were not skimping out of the sauce and fish flakes.   We also got the oyster motoyaki ($9.50) - roughly 6 mini oysters baked with a layer of cheese on top. It was decent but oily due to the cheese (normal for cheese dishes). The rupture roll ($15.95) was a roll stuffed with crab meat with spicy sashimi on top, dressed with a spicy sauce and fish roe. This was pretty good and not overly spicy!   Overall, the food is as my review \"A-OK\" but if you get as disturbed as me about the food flies... All and all, would I go back? Maybe, for happy hour deals..."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and tried the miso ramen and the chicken karaage. The food came relatively quickly and was pretty good. The ramen wasn't as good as some of the top places in the city and I prefer thicker noodles. But the ramen was reasonably priced. The chicken karaage came piping hot. It had a few big hunks of chicken that were tasty and the rice it was on was good. A lot of the people around us seemed to be getting sushi. The service was good. All and all a good lunch experience."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food, but I am consistently disappointed in Toronto. It's like we have 1,001 'innovative' and 'fusion' Japanese and one or two actual Japanese restaurants in this town. I suspect because most of these Japanese restaurants are actually non-Japanese and are like Kinka or Menami which are owned by non-Japanese folk. Also, since most of these guys are not trained in Japanese cuisine they just make up their own stuff.  Ebisu is Japanese owned and staffed so this is not Kushi Sake Bar where the Korean staff talk in Korean to the owner/chef as they serve spicy sushi rolls and serve their kushi skewers with chili peppered hot sauce!!  OK so how is Ebisu? They have creamy cheese and chowder and spicy this and spicy that all of which are not Japanese tastes and flavours. The ramen is OK of which they have several kinds, but the tonkotsu (pork bone soup) is not actually tonkotsu just like the one at Sansotei. It is not made from pork bones steeped and boiled overnight in pork bones it does not have the taste, reek and depth of tonkotsu. So that is disappointing, but the usual. Also, ramen should be $7-$8 to match Japanese pricing and value, but here we are used to $14 ramen I guess!! A better taste and value are the donburi (rice) dishes. They are not super great tasting, but they do taste fine, come in a variety of tastes and meats and are placed equivalent to what they traditionally should be. Get a couple of these! Why?? They are small \"mini\" so probably are designed to be sides. The curry was disappointing. It came in a not-so-warm lump and had nothing else in it. I mean they need to mix some vegetables or onions or potatoes or something to the lump of curry and of course make it smoother. Strangely, they do not carry what is considered Japan's best beer: Yebisu (which is a different spelling for 'Ebisu'). Finally, the restaurant is like Guu (also on Queen West) it is mostly a single corridor with less room if you are a larger group."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend around Halloween time. It was around 7pm the restaurant was pretty full.   Unagi rice tasted really good but the portion is really small.  The ramen was decent but nothing compared to the legit ramen stores.  The broth was not flavourful enough.  Again the portion is very small. Not really filling even I would need two bowls and I usually don't eat a lot...  Complaint: the wooden spoon that they give you for the ramen smelt and tasted like dish soap.  Waiting time for this dish to arrive was around 45 minutes.  Also ordered the torched sushi. This dish alone took an hour to come. They torch the sushi in front of you. Comparing this to other places I've tried. The flavours very bland   Disappointed with my experience here. I was expecting more for a franchisee coming from Vancouver I guess.. but this place was nothing special or mind blowing.  The wait time for all the food here takes way too long. Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a quick eat."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review on Ebisu for a long time.  I live literally across the street so my husband and I have been here at least 10 times.  We are a fan!!!  The sushi is great and the staff is very friendly.  A tip is to keep your receipt because if you return within 2 weeks you get 10% off your order.  They have happy hour where their tapas is 1/2 off which is a fantastic deal.  Their ramen is reasonably price and their dessert (tempera ice cream and black sesame creme brulee is tasty and quite cheap!) Ebisu also hosted a large meetup for us awhile back and were great in offering separate bills.  They are very accommodating.  Definitely one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I find that this is one of my go-to's in Toronto. The food is all quite filling and fresh and the price isn't too bad for the quality you're getting. I've tried most of the appetizers which are my favourites on the menu, specifically the chicken karaage and gyozas. I also always get the sashimi don which is extremely filling and the sashimi has always been fresh."}
{"text":"Went here during their HAPPY HOUR! And it was good!!! Great deals, although limited items but still couldnt complain with the bucks that we've saved!!!   Ordered: 6pcs takoyaki ($3.50)   Seared pork ($3.75)  Karage ($4.50) Truffle Fries ($2.95)  All of it, good for 2 person to share. VERY GREAT DEAL for an afternoon snack!!  Thanks, Ebisu!"}
{"text":"Food: 1/5 Service: 1/5 Atmosphere: 2/5  Would come back? No  Ebisu is a self-proclaimed master chef sushi restaurant. Don't be fooled - the quality of the rice and fish is on par or worse than all-you-can-eat sushi. The rice was NOT sushi rice! It was overcooked, mushy and was drenched in way too much vinegar.  They have blowtorched sushi that they prepare on the table. Lesson learned - don't let waitresses blowtorch the sushi! Blowtorching is a skill, especially with aburi, and it takes a certain technique and timing to get it right. Our waitress overcooked the fish. We tried all the varieties of blowtorched sushi (salmon, mackerel, etc.) and they were all very disappointing - way too much rice and the fish did not taste fresh. Our food also came 1.5 hours late despite asking the waitress to check on it three times. The atmosphere, menu and decor also felt cheap, despite being a famous sushi chain from Vancouver."}
{"text":"Came here at around 5pm with my sister and the restaurant was relatuvely empty with a few people eating. We were placed right away. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and the meal itself was really good. The noodles were similar to the noodle packs but much nicer. The service was great, I will for sure come back to try their other specialties."}
{"text":"Great for late night eats!  At 10:30 pm on a Friday night, there surprisingly aren't too many options off Queen West for food. Ebisu was one of the few that opened the midnight with many options for sushi, ramen, appetizers and drink specials.    Clean, simple decor and the service was pretty quick.  Drinks: they have a drink special every night of the week, Friday they had Sake shots for $3 each.  Food: We ordered Edamame which at first was amazing, perfectly salted with a hint of butteriness to it.  But then halfway through the bowl, it was just mainly salty giving the impression that it was seasoned in the bowl and only the top half was given the attention.  The Ebisu roll was my favourite!  It was hand torched to perfection to melt the cream cheese at the top slightly to marry some of the teriyaki sauce into the roll. Great combo with the mango, eel tempura, salmon, and tuna. The Raputure roll was equally delicious that isn't on their online menu but can be found in store.    The washroom didn't have anything to dry your hands with and I had to opt for toilet paper and air dry to grab the door.  The prices were comparable to other Japanese restaurants and the noise level was just perfect for talking without feeling like you had to shout to speak. I'm interested in coming here for their happy hour and half off appetizers on my next visit."}
{"text":"Ebisu: B+ for trying!  3 star place for Japanese food with a wide selection of Japanese apps, sushi, ramen and rice bowls. 1 star for value. We ended up paying $51 with tax and tip for 2 (OK) mains and 2 (lame) starters. Sushi was fresh but had almost no taste and the ramen was unimpressive.  However! I would come here for a drink and a snack-they have the game on! The space is large and they have a bar too.  Not bad but don't come here for dinner.  Insider knowledge: apparently they have 5 restaurants in Vancouver and this is their first in Toronto."}
{"text":"I visited Ebisu On Queen out of sheer serendipity. It was during happy hour where tapas are 50% off. I had a serious avocado craving that day and for some reason, the supermarket did not have any. Maybe it was cause our obsession with avocados is killing the environment and the supermarket was doing the world a favour by not selling it.   Regardless, I walked by Ebisu On Queen and there it was, avocado salad for $3.50. I was elated! Initially, I was expecting a tiny bowl of salad to satisfy my avocado cravings, it turns out to be a big bowl salad with all the fixings! YUM!   Happy day!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. The restaurant wants 80% full. But the service was extreme slow. When the waitress came to take our order she told us all the sushi and sashimi on the menu would take at least 40mins to make. So we decided to order the ramen and a rice dish because she said they would be quick. But we ended up waiting 20mins for the rice bowl. 50mins for the ramen and a hour for the torched pressed sushi.   The eel rice bowl was good but small  The ramen tasted a little off. It has a minor detergent smell to it. It was probably from the wooden spoon.  The torched press sushi is very plain. They torch them in front of you though. But they aren't as good  as Miku and other places.   Portion wise it was really small and not worth it.   Service was ok, the waiters were friendly.  But I will not come again."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 A ok. Portion: pretty good. Service: 4/5 Summary: a nice restaurant on Queen that offers cheap food  We came here for afternoon special. We order Fuji ramen which was on sale. The portion was big. It is enough for 2 people. However, it got a lot of bean sprouts. We also ordered fried chicken which was just meh~ I would recommend to come here for afternoon or evening special. However, I don't think I would for its regular price."}
{"text":"Went here to try out the newly opened Japanese restaurant on Queen, and I have to say I'm not impressed. I'll start with the interior which had the typical Asian bar decor which was nice and the seasonal decor was one of the highlights of my time here.   Service was decent. Waters were filled without asking and checking up on us ever so often. Another thing to note was that the atmosphere was kind of off here. Maybe it was the day, but I feel like this place should be jumping and dare I say, lit, similar to Nome Izakaya, but we were the loudest table (sorry) and everyone else was quiet.   What really turned me off though were the prices vs. the food vs. the quality. Previous reviews hit it right on the spot where there's a big discrepancy on what you pay vs. the amount of food that you get. I opted for the $15 eel bowl and the bowl was perhaps a bit bigger than my fist and it literally consisted of only rice and a few pieces of eel. Cmon, at least give me more rice to fill myself up? Some cheap veggies? The quality was good but nothing to rave about. To add to that, some of my friends ordered various items and what they paid for was too dang high.   I'm a lover of Japanese food, but I would not come back to Ebisu anytime soon. I gave them a 3 for their good service and nice decor, but the food portions and prices need to be worked on."}
{"text":"Ebisu is nestled in the middle of a very popular and trendy Queen Street.  The restaurant is not big, and has a cozy demeanor. Once i was seated, i checked in on Yelp.  The app told me that i could get chicken karage for free so i showed the offer to the waitress.  Around 20 minutes later, i was told they ran out.  My friend got a gift certificate of $10 to compensate for this, but when i asked for the gift certificate, the manager told me that they ran out of gift certificates to issue as well. When it was time to order, my friends and i wanted to order the set menu of 3 courses set at $28.  But every time we tried to order that, the waitress stopped taking our orders and walked away.  Another waitress came, and again, same thing happened.  For the 3rd time attempt, my friend actually took over and helped her take our orders.  I kid you not when i say the waitress looked petrified and so lost.  Perhaps it was her first day, or maybe it was because we were a large group, but it took over an hour to take our orders.   I did ask her afterward how long she had been working there.  She said 6 months.  Food came just over 2 hours after we were seated.  The presentations of the food were very pretty, and they tasted nice.  In between our courses, the chef put on a show on sashimi boat presentations.  It was a lot of fun to watch.   I get that there were many people there, but the poor process of having our orders taken, and the chicken karage/gift certificate situation, (and my friend got a plate dropped on her by a waitress) should really be a huge concern from the restaurant's point of view.  Instead, when the bills came, a 15% tip was forced upon us.  I thought that was uncalled for and in poor taste on Ebisu's part."}
{"text":"Ebisu gives a unique izakaya vibe as it's alley-like layout, wall art, large kitchen/bar, and very friendly staff welcomes you in. With a variety of sushi, appetizers, sashimi, ramen, and monthly specials, and of course beer, Ebisu is a great choice for those that want many options to try and/or share. We had the Miso Ramen (which was average) and Eel with rice on stone bowl (which was delicious!). Luckily, I also had a Yelp coupon for free karaage which was also average and too oily. I didn't have a chance to try their sushi but certainly there will be a next time! Lastly, keep an eye out for their happy hour specials like the Fujisan Ramen as they do offer discounts between 5-6pm!"}
{"text":"After a very long financial meeting, I was hangry. Like, very, very hangry and I wanted sushi. So we came here, but then I realized I wanted ramen. Any decent Japanese that is this diverse, quick and reasonably priced on Queen W is a friend of mine. I had a shoyu and shared some gyozas with the guy I was taking my hanger out on. No one can stay mad over oodles of salty noodles. Rah rah for ramen in big booths!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a couple friends. And all the dishes we ordered was delicious! So we kept ordering more. Sooo over stuffed but well worth it.  We had 4 people and order over 15 dishes/ appetizers. We all agreed that we come back again to try more dishes. :)     Back here again with my husband and friends. Food is still amazing and satisfying. Tried more dishes today. Sooo full once again!"}
